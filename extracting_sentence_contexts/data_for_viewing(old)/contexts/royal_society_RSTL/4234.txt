2 MR. AIRY ON THE LAWS OF THE TIDES

which the tide-wave undergoes in passing up a contracted channel of comparatively
small depth. That the series of obseryations should be s0 arranged, that, at every
station, one complete tide (from high water to high water, or from low water to low
water) should be completely observed on every day, its observations being made at
small equidistant intervals. That snpplementary observations, applying only to the
neighbourhood of the low water or high water omitted in the obseryations of the
complete tide, should also be made, for the development of the principal facts of
diurnal tide. Finally, that the zeros of the tide-gauges should be connected with the
principal lines of level, s0 that every observation $should be referred to the same
hydrostatic level.

These- suggestions were adopted in their utmost extent by Colonel Cousy. The
collection of observations was placed in my hands in the winter of 1842. The whole
number of observations exceeds two hundred thousand ; the cireumstances of place,
simultaneity, extent of plan, and uniformity of plan, appear to give them extraordinary
value; and extent of time alone appears wanting to render them the most important
<eries of tide-observations that has ever-been made.

Having under my immediate direction a large number of computers, employed at
