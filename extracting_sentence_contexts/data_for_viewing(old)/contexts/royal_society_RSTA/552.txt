need only be nominally established.

(c) Phase Ill upgrading, updating, verification and validation of nonlinear model
(Steps 8-10)

The final phase in this process involves one new task and two traditional onesâ€”8, 9 and 10,
respectively. Model Updating (Step 9) is quite a well-developed procedure now for linear systems,
and there are a number of algorithms and software packages that can be used to support this


task. However, there is an important qualification that applies to all updating exercises, including
for linear structures, and that is the need to verify that the model is capable of being updated
before embarking on that process. Simply, this means ensuring that the model does in fact include
sufficient parameters or elements to be capable of describing the structural behaviour adequately
once the correct values for these parameters have been determined. The problem that can arise
is that a model updating procedure can be applied to a model which is not verified, and while a
result is obtained, this result is unreliable, and often involves the adoption of unrealistic values
for the parameters that have been updated.

In the case of a nonlinear structure, a new issue arises in the sense that each model element
is likely to have a higher order characteristic than would be the case for a linear structure. In
other words, an individual stiffness element might require twice as many (or more) parameters
to be included to describe the nonlinear physical behaviour accurately enough. To accommodate
this possibility, and to ensure a verified model being available for the final stage of updating to
determine the correct numerical values of all the crucial elements, the process of establishing how
