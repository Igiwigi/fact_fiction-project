270 PROFESSOR TYNDALL'S OBSERVATIONS ON THE MER DE GLACE.

nexion with the point, and I think one result of snch observations would be the esta-
blishment of the comparative shallowness of the Glacier de L6chaud.

There is another characteristic of glacier motion which was predicted by Professor
Forsxs, before any observations had been made upon the point, and afterwards con-
firmed both by his own measurements and those of M. MarTINs,â€”I allude to the fact
that the glacier is not only retarded by its sides, but by its bottom, the superficial ice
thus moving more quickly than that in contact with the bed of the glacier.

Objections have been made to both the measurements alluded to, and I was therefore
desirous to submit the question to a new test. 'The experiments which I have to record
were made upon the face of an ice precipice, which offered a rare opportunity for an
observation of the kind. The face formed the eastern boundary of the Glacier du Geant
near the Tacul, was about 140 feet in height, and nearly vertical. I requested Mr. Hirgr
to place two stakes, one at the top and the other at the bottom of this precipice. This
was done on the 3rd of August; and on the 5th it was found that the stake at the top
had moved through 124 inches, while that at the bottom showed an advance of 6 inches
only. There was some uncertainty regarding this latter result, on account of the danger
