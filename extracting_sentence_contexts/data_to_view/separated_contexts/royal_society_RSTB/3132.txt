Such
yolk nuclei have been frequently described for the ova of widely separated animals ;
amongst those of recent years we may especially mention that described for Lumbricus
by Canxkiys (1895), for the diplopods Polyzonium and Blanijulus by Nemec (1897),
for the arachnid Pholeus by BampeKe (1898), and for the tunicate Molgula by
Crampton (1899). In spite, however, of the general, and indeed often striking,
resemblance these and many other yolk nuclei show to that of Antedon, yet their
mode of origin, fate, and general significance are made to differ widely from those I
have described for the latter type. The suspicion that these differences may be due
rather to the personal equation of the authors than to any such fundamental
difference between the yolk nuclei themselves is considerably strengthened by the
fact that, even for the yolk nucleus of Antedon itself, Crery described a fate and
assumed a general significance totally different from those which my own observations
have led me to assume for this type. According to Crery,* the yolk nucleus
disintegrates, and the fragments so formed scatter over the egg and form fresh proto-
plasm, the yolk nucleus thus taking an active part in forming the plastic substances
of the cytoplasm; a theory which is essentially in agreement with that originally
propounded by SreBatp in 1848, and subsequently adopted by numerous workers. A
similar fragmentation of the yolk nucleus has been described by numerous recent
authors, ¢e.g.,
