area where the flora was similar to that represented by the plants in the roof nodules.
Tt may be remarked that this furnishes additional support for the theory of the
origin of the coal balls in the seams in which they now occur. Did they represent a
drifted flora they would have more in common with the drifted floras of the shales
and roof nodules. Further, this comparison yields strong support to the view that
the coals themselves have not drifted, but have collected where they grew; a view
which is in harmony with the fact that clays or “ gannister” floors contain nothing
but rootlets and underlie the seams. Our conclusion is that these coals were formed
in situ, and that in them the “ coal ball” concretions were slowly aggregated without
any serious disturbance. Trifling drifting, due to local currents or streams is, of
course, not to be denied, but in the main the coals represent forests which grew where
their remains now lie. We here touch the larger question of coal formation, as well
as that of the coal balls themselves, because the facts quoted seem to afford practical
proof of the in situ'theory of the formation of the coal. Nevertheless, the day is past

when geologists would apply any one theory to all the coal seams, and our views refer
only to those of which we have special knowledge, viz., those containing “coal balls.”
