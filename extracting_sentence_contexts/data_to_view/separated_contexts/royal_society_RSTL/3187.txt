An extraordinary instance of this is
afforded in Plate VII. fig. 124. where in an oyum of less than 4‚Äù the embryo had attained
a stage far beyond what is usual in ova many times as large (par. 218.). On the other
band, Plate VI. fig. 110. presents an instance in which development (as compared
for example with that of the oyum fig. 113.) appeared to have been retarded.

168. Nor do any two parts of the ovum necessarily keep pace with one another ; a
fact well shown in Plate VII. fig. 124., where the incipient umbilical vesicle (bb7) and
the structure am. are very far behind the embryo in the degree of their development.

169. In the following description therefore of successive stages, it will not in ge-
neral be desirable to state particularly the dimensions of the oyum, nor minutely to
detail the condition of any of its parts but those that serve to mark the stage. Third Stage of Development.
