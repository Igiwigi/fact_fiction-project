observed that the peripheral tufts acquire a faint blue tinge, and, when a portion
is highly magnified, numerous blue pigmented bodies, similar to those in fig. 25, are
seen ; they correspond to small collections of brown pigment which are nearly always
to be met with in the disintegrating animal tissue surrounding the hyphe ; the iron
in the colouring matter is probably for the most part of vascular origin. Thus a micro-
chemical examination of the dark masses furnishes good evidence of the presence of
iron, and this exactly accords with the chemical analysis. Chemical analyses have
been made both by Bristow and by Lewis and CunntneHam, and have revealed
the presence of iron. Brisrowe states that a small quantity of ash was left after
combustion, and that it contained a little oxide of iron, but much less than a similar
quantity of altered blood would have contained after combustion. According to
Lewis and CunnrncHaw, the ash is of a red colour, owing to the presence of oxide
of iron, and this fact points to an origin identical with the other pigmentary

deposits in animal tissues. Spectroscopic examination of the colouring matter of
the brown masses does not any way favour a blood origin. We have ourselves
incinerated thick pieces of the large black mass. The dried particles burn with a
luminous flame. There is a smell of ‘burnt feathers.” Heated on the platinum
capsule, there is no sputtering whatever, and a residue is left white in the centre but
