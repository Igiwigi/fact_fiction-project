It should be noted that with the
relative decrease in size and importance of the paraseptals there is in the stages of
Perameles examined a corresponding increase in the palatine processes of the pre-
maxilla, (See Broom, 1.) The Cartilages of the Larynx.â€”The cartilages of the larynx in the Marsupialia
are of special interest owing to the secondary changes which take place during
development. Though the specimens of Perameles, at present under consideration,
do not show any further peculiarities, they confirm the facts and theories already

known, and, so far as the writer is aware, it is the first series that has been figured. These secondary changes, as already stated, are the fusing of the cricoid with the
body and also with the posterior cornu of the thyroid. This results in the stiffening
of the whole apparatus, rendering the larynx very inflexible.
