In one way or another, therefore, the molecules in a thin layer of gas enclosed between
two attracting surfaces must differ in the specification of their energy content from the
molecules in the body of the gas and, like those in an enclosed layer of liquid, they form
a different osmotic species, but the difficulties in the way of this hypothesis are serious :—
An air gap of 0-004 to 0-007 mm. seems inconsistent with the rate of relaxation of
strain in a gas. An even more formidable difficulty lies in the fact that the gap is
unchanged when the air is displaced by liquid (XT, 224), for two different causes are
unlikely to produce precisely the same effect. Finally, electric repulsion of the kind
indicated above seems inconsistent with the fact that the gap is the same, namely,
0-004 mm. for carefully-trued cylinders and plates of materials so dissimilar electrically
as steel and glass. The position may be summarised as follows :-—

Any theory of the Leslie pressure must account for four curious facts :—

(1) The distance h at which the cylinder floats above the plate is independent of the
nature of the lubricant and of the solids, provided the surfaces are clean.

(2) The distance is the same in clean air as it is when the air is displaced by a liquid
and remains the same until the pressure of the air is reduced to 2 mm. of mereury. STR WILLIAM HARDY ON PROBLEMS OF THE BOUNDARY STATE. 25

(3) The distance in clean air was decreased by contaminating the solid faces.
(4) The difficulty with which a cylinder can be forced down on to a plate and the
relative ease with which it can be wrung down.
