Both these circumstances, but especially
the first, as already shown, operate unfavourably in experiments on impregnation,
more eggs being fertilized at a high temperature, when the changes go on rapidly,
and especially when the seminal fluid has been most recently obtained, than under
the opposite conditions. The general results of my experiments, however, may be
regarded as quite confirmatory of SPALLA4NzanT's more remarkable one, as they prove,
like that, that only an exceedingly small proportion of seminal fluid is necessary to
fertilize the ovum.

THE OVUM IN THE AMPHIBIA. 207

But however satisfactory these experiments were with regard to that fact, they still
left the question of the immediate agency of the spermatozoa in impregnation in
doubt. I therefore repeated them with greater precision, and with that object only
in view, and took especial care to obtain as perfect a filtration and separation of the
spermatozoa from the fluid as possible. The results were far more interesting and
instructive than I had anticipated, as I found by repeated examination by the micro-
8cope that the filtered fluid was almost completely deprived of spermatozoa, one or
two only being occasionally detected in it, with a very few nuclei and spermatozoal
cells.
