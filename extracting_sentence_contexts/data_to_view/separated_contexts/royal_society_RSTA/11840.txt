The closest fitting curve of Type I. runs, as we have seen,
1°35 years about before birth, and gives three antenatal cases. Three antenatal cases
(or, indeed, 9 in the case of the curve of Type III.) is a very small percentage of
8689 cases, and not of importance from the statistician’s standpoint. But the fact
that a curve starting before birth gives a better fit than one starting at birth, is
significant, and there is every probability that a curve starting from about — ‘75 year
would give a still less percentage error than one from 1°35 year or from birth.t

In dealing with mortality curves for infancy I have found it impossible to get good
fitting theoretical curves, without carrying these curves backward to a limit of
something less than a year. 'The “ theoretical” statistics thus obtained of antenatal
deaths seem to be fairly well in accordance with the actual statistics of maternity
charities. In vital statistics therefore we must be prepared in most diseases for small
percentages of antenatal cases and antenatal deaths, and it is just possible that theory
in this matter will be able to indicate lines of profitable inquiry to the medical —
statistician,

(27.) Hxample VII.—As an example of the method of Section 15, I take the
following statistics of guessing a tint. Nine mixtures of black and white were taken,
