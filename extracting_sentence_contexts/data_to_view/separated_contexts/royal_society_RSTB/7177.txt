A thin layer of
myoblastic tissue covers the rudiments of the ejaculatory ducts at this early stage and
extends to link up with the distal ends of the mesodermal strands. This may wrongly
suggest that this myoblastic tissue is a continuation of the mesodermal strands, since it may
appear as if these structures ended in two hypodermal swellings. The myoblastic tissue,
however, is not in fact a strand, but spreads broadly to cover the area between the
hypodermal rudiments and the nearby muscles. Ficure 22. Dissection of the male larva of Ficure 23.
