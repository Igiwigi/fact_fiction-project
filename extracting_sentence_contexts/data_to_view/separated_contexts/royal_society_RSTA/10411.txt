Received June 5, 1901—Read June 20, 1901. Ever since the first discovery of the Electric Arc, nearly 100 years ago, the secret
of its mechanism has been one of the most fascinating mysteries of science. To
account for its abnormally high temperature, and for the fact that a higher P.D. is
required to send a small current than a large one through it, the are has been
endowed with unique properties, such as a back E.M.F. of many volts, and even a
negative resistance. The measurement of this resistance alone has been the object
of a large number of experiments, made under all conceivable conditions. The object of the present paper is to see how far this peculiar behaviour of the
are might have been logically predicted from the known conditions of its existence,
viz., that it is a gap in a circuit, furnishing its own conductor by the evaporation of
its own material; and to show that it is quite unnecessary to invoke the aid of a
negative resistance, or even of a large back E.M.F., to account for this behaviour.
