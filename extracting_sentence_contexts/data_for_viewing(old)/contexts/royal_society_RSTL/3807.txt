spheric air in solution, which had escaped to fill the vacnum. When the stopper was
taken out the liquid rose suddenly in the hydrogen tube 2:2 cubic inches, giving the
equivalent of the oxygen in the tube and in solution. It is very possible that this ex-
periment repeated might sometimes exhibit an evolution of hydrogen in the oxygen
tube arising from the escape of the nitrogen of the atmospheric air in solution, and
acting as in experiment 29, but I have not seen this effect take place. It should be
distinctly understood, that in all the experiments mentioned in this Postscript, except
the first part of experiment 28, single cells only were used.

Upon the theory of the experiments 29 and 30 I will venture no positive opinion.
That gaseous hydrogen should abstract oxygen from hydrogen, without the latter
forming any other combination, is a fact 80 novel, that any attempted explanation is
likely to prove premature. If, contrary to the views of Darrox, we suppose that
gases when mixed are held together by a feeble chemical affinity, then we may say
that the affinity of the nitrogen or carbonic acid for hydrogen produces the effect ;
the affinity of the oxygen of the water, being balanced between the hydrogen in the
liquid and that in the tube, would enable the resultant feeble aflinity of the nitrogen
for hydrogen to prevail; but on this supposition, why does not oxygen produce an
analogous effect? Its tendency directly to combine with platinum may indeed be
regarded as an opposing force, but this tendency is by many considered hypothetical.
On the other hand, it may be called an effect of contact ; but this, unconnected with
a chemical theory, presents no other idea to the mind than the fact itself presents, it
furnishes no link by which we may extend the phenomena. TI therefore, until a better
theory be found, should be inclined to adopt the former view, and to regard mixed
