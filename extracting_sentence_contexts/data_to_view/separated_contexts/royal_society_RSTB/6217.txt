These become intermingled cranially with
isthmal glands and caudally with the uterine type. The junctional region (length
approximately 2 cm) is referred to as the isthmo-uterine junction, ij, fig. 1, Plate 12. The uterus averages 7 cm in length, and the vagina, which is devoid of tubular glands,
extends for 6 cm.

The chief interest of this region, in the present work, lies in the fact that it is the
source of the heavy chalaziferous secretion which forms a thin layer around the
mature ovum, internal to the dense albumen. Several oviducts, containing ova in
the upper section of the albumen region, form the material on which the following
description is based. ‘They represent the end-point of secretion in the infundibulum. A uniform ciliated epithelium (height 30»), in which no glandular cells are
evident, covers the funnel wall, with the exception of the shallow pits between the
