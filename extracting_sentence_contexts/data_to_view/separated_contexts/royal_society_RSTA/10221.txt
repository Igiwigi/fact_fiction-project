C. CHREE: ANALYSIS OF RESULTS FROM THE FALMOUTH MAGNETO-

§ 5. It is natural to suppose—as was in fact remarked by myself when first
discussing the phenomenon*—that the non-eyclic increase in H on quiet days is
connected in some way with the considerable decrements in H, which in the majority
of instances accompany magnetic storms. It would appear, however, that the
mean size of the non-cyclic effect on the Astronomer Royal’s quiet days for a year
cannot be inferred from the character of that year as disturbed or otherwise. For
example, 1894 was much more disturbed than the years immediately preceding or
following it; but the mean non-eyclie effect in H at both Kew and Falmouth is
distinctly less for 1894 than for 1893 or 1895.
