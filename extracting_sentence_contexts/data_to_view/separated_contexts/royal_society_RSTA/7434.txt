The reduction is
elaborate, and, moreover, we shall find it convenient to obtain a generalized form of the
reduction which will be applied in § 23 to reduce certain other forms. The principle of the
method used here is to start with an expression which, being an actual product of forms, is
clearly reducible, and to transform it into a certain linear expression in the forms which we
are discussing (together with certain reducible terms). From the fact that this linear expres-
sion, and hence similar expressions obtained by permuting the symbols, is reducible, the
reducibility of the forms under consideration is finally established. The selection of the
starting point in a reduction of this type is a matter of trial and error, and the complexity of
the reduction (which is one of the most elaborate to be considered) seems inherent in the
nature of the case, as attempts to obtain a simpler reduction invariably led to failure. We start from the relation, valid since each team is the product of two actual forms,

(bar) (grt) (piu) . (q'sf) (q'b'J) (shu) + (b9s) (9st) (piu). (q'x1) (q'P'7) (r'u)=0. (8-1)
Here pf, p’ and q, 7’ are two sets of equivalent symbols.
