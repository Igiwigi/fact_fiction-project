and as explained above (p. 89) in Gi. spelunce, there is a slight overlapping basal flap.
It is not suggested that any species of Gleichenia represents the ancestry of Loasoma,
but I do point out that the salient differences in the sori are differences of degree
rather than differences in kind, while the basipetal sorus being an advance, physio-
logically, on the simultaneous, there is thus a reasonable probability that such a
transition should take place.

One of the most interesting, and from a comparative point of view most important
and continuous series among the Gradatie is that of the Hymenophyllacee. It
appears to me clear that it is a line of specialisation of a nature similar to that
indicated in the “ filmy” Yodeas, but carried much further, and represented by many
more species in our present Flora, In Todea the “ filmy” habit is accompanied by a
smaller number of spores per sporangium. The fact that some species of
Hymenophyllacee have a larger output per sporangium than any others of the
Gradatz or Mixtee, gives the series a special significance, if as the genus Todea
suggests, the “filmy” habit leads to reduction of the output per sporangium,

The transition from the Gradatze to the Mixtse has probably taken place through
various lines of descent, and, as we may believe it to have been a more modern change,
so we find the steps of the transition quite clearly indicated in living species. That
such a passage from the basipetal to the mixed sorus did take place, seems to
me to be the only explanation of the facts stated at length above for the genera
Dennstedtia, Microlepia, and Davallia, while these lead on naturally to the bulk of
the Pteridez. A reasonable probability of a similar transition has also been made
out for the Cyatheacew, Woodsia, Hypoderris, &e. The biological considerations
