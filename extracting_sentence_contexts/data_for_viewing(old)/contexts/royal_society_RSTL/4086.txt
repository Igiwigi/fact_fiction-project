paw to the other. I repeated the experiment frequently, and have always observed that,
after a certain time, varying from twenty-five to forty minutes, the inverse limb alone
contracted on breaking the circuit. Thus it appears that it requires a somewhat
longer time to produce the same effect with the electric current upon the aerve of
the living animal, than upon the dead one.

It thus remains clearly proved that the passage of the electric current through a
mized nerve modifies the excitability of this nerve in a very different manner, accord-
ing to its direction : the nerve traversed by the direct current loses its excitability
much more rapidly than that which is traversed by the inverse current. T ought here
to add, that hitherto we have no experiment proving that a nerve snhjected to
the passage of the inverse current loses its excitability otherwise than it would
have done if merely left to itself. I return to the exposition of facts. Out of ten
frogs submitted to the experiment above described, frequently eight at least present
the following phenomenon :â€”On breaking the circait after the current has circulated
twenty-five or thirty minutes, the inverse limb alone contracts ; but this contraction
does not cease immediately after the eircuit is broken. The inverse limb continues
to be contracted, exhibits, that is to say, symnptoms of fefanus. I bave frequently
witnessed the contractions lasting from ten to twenty seconds. If without waiting
till the contractions cease the circuit is again closed, the limb, which was stiff and
contracted, will be observed to give one more violent contraction when the circuit is
in the act of being closed, and then immediately return to its natural state. It is
not a rare occurrence to find frogs which present these phenomena after a lapse of
three or four hours of experiment. These phenomena exhibit themselves equally
when the passage of the current is confined to the nerve alone, to the exclusion of the
