Third Particular Case of {2, 4, 3}.—If in the work just preceding, we take the point P
to be on a chord / of ¢, then all quadrics which contain c, and P will contain 1; and ®
will consist of quadrics through a rational normal quartic curve ¢, and a line | bisecant of
¢,. Thus we get another special case of the quadric cubic transformation—the last of
the three such cases previously mentioned. ‘To the line J there will correspond a

* Tt is easy to see that no other E-lines on K,? go into nodes of V,*; each of the two trisecant planes of
¢,, for example, which lie on K,*, passes through P and corresponds to a generator y of Q which is simple on
V,3, and each of the co! E-conies which it contains goes into a point of y, simple on V,*.

+ It can also be shown that K, contains five general -surfaces ; so that of the fifteen planes of V,°, ten
correspond to the planes joining the ten chords to P and five correspond to @-surfaces lying on Ks.

t In fact if we take the coordinates of a point in S, to be (a, 6, ¢, fg, h) we can take the Veronese surface

to be given by

The six quadrics through this surface are then given by the minors A, B, C, F, G, H of this matrix, and the
symmetry arises from the fact that the minors of

A H G
H BF
G Fae |

are proportional to a, b, ¢, f, g, h.
