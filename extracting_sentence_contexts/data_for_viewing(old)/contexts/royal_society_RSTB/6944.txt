of an originally single bone, further examples of which are provided by the squamosal, tympanic,
malleus, stapes, and certain Wormian ossifications in Man, or the suborbital and opercular
ossicles in Lepidosteus.

and again

In other words, it is not possible to arrive at a satisfactory definition of what constitutes a bone along
embryological lines, in terms of separate centres of ossification. (Italics de Beerâ€™s.)

It is clear therefore that there are no reliable grounds on which the independence
of the palatine processes in mammals can be asserted.

Again, in early papers much weight was placed on the fact that the vomer of
Ornithorhynchus ossified from a single centre by comparing it with typical parasphenoids.
The use of this argument was destroyed utterly when it was shown that the vomer
of the allied Echidna ossified from two centres, particularly since this occurs also in
other mammals (man, pig). Yet the argument has since been reversed and a double
origin used as evidence in favour of the prevomer-vomer homology. Also quite
recently it has been claimed that if two centres of ossification should be found in the
parasphenoid of a Dicynodont reptile the whole problem would be solved (Olson
1938, p. 169).

Taking into account this history, and the considered opinions of such workers as
de Beer, it is plain that paired or unpaired centres of ossification are valueless as
criteria in this problem at least, and cannot be used for identifying homologues of
