The verbal explanations given in the reading of that paper before the meeting were
illustrated by a drawing showing the scheme of circulation described in the paper,
Fig. 4, here given, is an accurate copy of that drawing, differing from it only in some
unimportant matters, such as in the number of arrows shown, and in its being drawn
with abatement of some exaggerations which were made in the original in order to
render small features more readily visible at a distance in a large room. ‘The full
significance of the original in all respects is retained unchanged in the copy here. In endeavouring to penetrate the mystery as to what the courses of circulation
might be in the middle and higher latitudes, I was in preliminary ways fully satisfied
that Haptey’s theory* in its main features—those, in fact, which in the present paper
I have already described with commendation—must be substantially true, and must
form the basis of any tenable theory that could be devised. Now, under Haptey’s theory, when we come to consider what may be the courses
of circulation that we should attribute to the atmosphere in the latitudes outside ot
the trade-wind zones, we should naturally be led to expect (as I have pointed out in
some detail in an earlier part of the present paper in describing his theory) that the
great sheet of air floating out from the Equator in the upper regions of the atmosphere
towards either Pole, while having a motion towards the east also, would gradually cool
in advancing to higher latitudes, and would therefore descend in middle and high
latitudes to the Earth’s surface and would next, as a bottom current, flow back
towards the Equator while also flowing eastward, and so would be a current towards
the Equator, not towards the Pole. But, on the other hand, it had been brought out
through accumulated observational results that the winds of middle latitudes while
blowing towards the east, which so far is in agreement with Hapixy’s theory, do, in
opposition to what would be expected under that theory, blow more towards the Pole
than from the Pole.
