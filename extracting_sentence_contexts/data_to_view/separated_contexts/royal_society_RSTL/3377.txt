MOVEMENTS OF VOLUNTARY MUSCLE. 463

markings is yet a matter of dispute among those who have the most carefully studied
this subject, and therefore that a new examination and new facts are required to de-
termine it. Enongh has also been said to show that their nature cannot be ascer-
tained withont elucidating the composition of the whole fasciculus, a circumstance
which induces me to make the following discussion subservient to explain the general
construction of this proximate anatomical element of muscle. In the first place, it is to be remarked, that no doubt seems to exist as to the fact,
that when alternate light and dark spaces are seen on individual fibrille, detached
from the mass, they are precisely equal in width to the light and dark striz on the
fasciculus from which they have been withdrawn.
