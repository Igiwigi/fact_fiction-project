This complex processing stage at 200-250 ms is preceded by
visual word form recognition in the fusiform gyrus, including form-based decomposition of morphologically complex words (turquoise, [66]), and followed by N400
type lexical access effects in middle temporal cortex, reflected in MEG by so-called M350 activity (light green, [67]). If the ‘centre of gravity’ for lexical—semantic
effects is around 350 ms, then the sensitivity of the LATL to word meaning and argument structure at approximately 200 ms is a puzzle. One possibility is that
semantic access is, in fact, a gradual process unfolding over time, with initial stages occurring well before the middle temporal ‘M350’ [28,44]. On such an account,
the light green processing stage would reflect ‘deeper’ semantic access (cf. [16]). Slightly after the M350 lexical access stage, we observe effects of linking word
Meanings to referents in the context, i.e. reference resolution (yellow, [68,69]), and overlapping with this, the second stage of semantic combinatory effects in the
vmPFC discussed in the main text (brown) (syn = syntactic; sem = semantic). pM/STG, posterior middle/superior temporal gyrus. (Online version in colour.)
