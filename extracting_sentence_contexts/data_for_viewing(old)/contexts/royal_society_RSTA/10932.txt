that the state of supersaturation is more easily maintained. This view that the
striation does not appear in the 8 until it has cooled down to 500° is of some
importance, as otherwise we are hardly entitled to speak of 8 as a uniform solid
solution. Another argument is that now and then we find a chill containing
unstriated 8, for example the patch of 8 of Sn 9 chilled at 546° and shown magnified
280 diameters. This is quite free from striation, as are all the other patches in the
section (fig. 18).

The very symmetrical way in which the 8 grows round the «@ (see fig. 24) during
the « + liquid = 8 reaction, suggests the view that the two bodies may be
isomorphous. Moreover, the primary combs of 8 seen in the chills of Sn 16 and Sn 17,
taken between the solidus and liquidus, are indistinguishable in form from « combs,
although they have never been in contact with that body. The facts already known
with regard to solid solutions of saline mixtures would not have led us to expect such

a case of isomorphism in what may be called two conjugate solid solutions, but the
great frequency of the regular system in the crystallisation of metals renders it more
probable than it would otherwise be.

The LC Alloys.—This small group, covering the atomic percentages from Sn 13°5
to Sn 15°5, consists of alloys which polish to a yellowish-white. The unchilled alloys
are compact, hard, and tough.
