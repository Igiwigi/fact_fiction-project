S.13.L. (Plate 27)—The sulci in this hemisphere are in many respects similar to
those in $.5.L. There are three sulci immediately posterior to the sulcus centralis.
The inferior one is a combined sulcus postcentralis inferior (157) and postcentralis
transversus. The superior sulcus is a definite sulcus postcentralis superior (15s).
Between the two postcentral sulci a horizontal sulcus is insinuated. This sulcus is
the pars horizontalis (164). The great length of the pars occipitalis in this
hemisphere suggests that this sulcus is confluent with the superior parietal sulcus.
The superior branches of the parallel sulcus are the first ascending branch (24),
wh ch lies separate in the supramarginal gyrus, the angular sulcus (25), and the
upper part of the anterior occipital sulcus (26) or second and third ascending
branches of the parallel. The hemisphere is remarkable in showing the small
extent of the folding of the cortex of the inferior parietal lobule indicated by the
fact that there are no sulci passing downward from the sulcus intraparietalis and
marking off the three parietal arcades.

$.13.R. (Plate 27)—In this hemisphere the ascending terminal limb of the fissure
of Sylvius is close to the lower end of the sulcus centralis. The sulcus postcentralis
inferior (157) arches over the ascending terminal limb and is separate from the
sulcus postcentralis superior (15s). Between these two sulci a small detached
sulcus lies immediately posterior to the middle of the sulcus centralis.

The sulcus postcentralis superior ends superiorly by bifurcating into two terminal
limbs. Inferiorly it is continuous with a sulcus which passes almost to the parallel
sulcus. The lower third of this sulcus is separated from the upper two-thirds by
