In the laboratory experiments in connection with this point photographs have been
obtained, which show the compound group with a bright maximum of intensity about
468, at the same time leaving the least refrangible maximum (474) fairly bright, and
the two intermediate ones much weaker. It is not difficult to understand that under
difficult conditions of observation such a group should be mapped as two lines, one
corresponding to the maximuin at 468 and the other to that at 474. Whatever the origin of the two lines, the fact of their being common to comets
and Nove is very significant. It is rather remarkable that in Nova Coron the F line should remain visible for a
longer time than the line near 500, because in Nova Cygni it died away first, leaving
500 very bright to the end. It must be remembered, however, that the later observa-
tions by Mr. Stone were made under very difficult couditions, the F line itself being
“desperately faint,” so that the 500 line may very well have been overlooked.
