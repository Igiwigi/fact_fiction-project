The Anguilla species, in contrast to other murenoids, are usually termed fresh-
water eels, and are reckoned among the fresh-water fishes of Europe and North
America. From what we have now learned this is fur from literally strict. Both
from their history and their actual manner of life, these “fresh-water eels” are
true oceanic fishes, and the remarkable point in their life-history is not so much
the fact of their migrating out into the sea to spawn, as in their leaving it in
order to pass their period of growth in an environment so unusual for mureenoid
fishes as fresh-water.

I have in the foregoing pages described the course of our investigations, and set
forth their results. In conclusion, I will endeavour very briefly to give an outline of
the life-history of our eel, as indicated by the facts now ascertained.

During the autumn months, the silvery eels leave the lakes and rivers and move
out into the sea. Once beyond fresh-water limits, the eels are, in most parts of
Europe, outside our range of observation. Exceptions are, however, found as in the
case of the Danish sounds and belts, and adjacent waters, which are passed by great
quantities of eels on their way to the Atlantic, and form the site of important
fisheries about October. In the western part of the English Channel, trawlers may,
towards the end of the year, occasionally bring up a few big specimens in their nets,
but after this, the last trace of the eel on European ground is lost. No longer
subject to pursuit by man, hosts of eels from the most distant corners of our
continent can now shape their course south-west across the ocean, as their ancestors
for unnumbered generations have done before them, How long the journey lasts
