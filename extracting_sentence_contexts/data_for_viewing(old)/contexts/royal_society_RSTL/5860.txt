\ to clear Alta Vista by about 300 feet, and at 8 p.M. the IG of the dew-point

was 11.

On the 16th the barometer had risen to 20-632, the temperature increased from 399,
its lowest, to 43*; and the depression of the dew-point to 5*3.

During these- days, and until the 19th, when we left the mountain, the sky was con-
tinually cloudy, 7. e. there was a stratum of cloud at a height greater than 12,000 feet,
in addition to the lower stratum at 4000 feet, and this upper bed was eminently hazy
and misty. The sun by day, and the moon by night, were seen as pale and watery as
they are in the generality of English weather; the autumn had in fact set in on the

SJountain top, and that locality had lost its specialities as a site for astronomical
abservations.
E On descending the mountain, beyond the N.E. cloud being broken up and scattered,
Se found that no perceptible change in the weather had been experienced below. On
#he night of the 14th, when we on the mountain were fearing that the station at Alta
ista would be undermined or be washed away by the torrents of rain, not a drop had
Gillen on either the N. or S. coast of the island ; nay, even a party of visitors who had
ft us at about 3 P.M. on that day, after the hail-storm, gained the bottom of the
:Mountain without any more wet; and on referring to the Captain's journal on board
e yacht, some of the warmest, weather of the whole season occurred with him, when
e were at the wettest and coldest on the mountain.
