C. Temperature.â€”Height of Bagndres de Luchon, 2008 feet (CaarrenTIER).

The springs of Luchon bave undergone most surprising changes. CAMPERDON, a
writer of credit, and himself physician for thirty years at this place, assures us that
the Source de la Reine was cold until 1755, when (on occasion of the great earthquake
of Lisbon) it assumed a temperature of 41* REaumur. The hot springs of many parts

of Europe were affected by the same event*. What shows that these springs are
much connected with the sources of ordinary springs, is a curious fact mentioned to
me by M. Banrav, one of the Inspecting Physicians of Luchon. In 1835, after great
rains (in the month of May if my memory serves me rightly), the same spring, La
Reine, delivered four times as much water as usual, and its temperature fell 16?
Reavuur, This continued for twenty-five days, when it resumed its former state.
The following Table contains: 1. The observations of Cameerpon in 1761 ; 2. Those
of M. Barrav in 1818; 3. Two ets of observations by M. BorsGraup, Professor of
Chemistry at Toulouse, made at two different periods. I have reduced the whole to
FanRENnneiT's scale.
