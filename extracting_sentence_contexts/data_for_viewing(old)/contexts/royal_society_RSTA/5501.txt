All of these systems can generate a pattern by amplifying the initial noise in a near-uniform
system, whether the noise lies in random differences in local chemical concentrations, cell
densities or mechanical strain. Turing assumed initial homogeneity out of analytical necessity,
recognizing the rarity of this condition within the developing organism (‘Most of an organism,
most of the time, is developing from one pattern into another, rather than from homogeneity into a pattern’,
Turing 1952). In many specific developmental situations the inducing noise or asymmetry may
not be random but instead influenced by field inhomogenities, such as a pre-existing anatomical
feature. Thus symmetry breaking as a property of a network or system should be viewed as a
potential rather than an event, as many systems capable of breaking symmetry and producing
pattern de novo will in fact be guided by pre-existing anatomical landmarks which bias the system
to pattern in a nonrandom manner. That is, while a symmetry breaking system can be defined
by its ability to break symmetry de novo, in an embryonic context it is seldom likely that a truly
symmetric or homogeneous field is the starting point for pattern formation.

Considering these cell behaviours and attributes, the structure of composite epithelial—
mesenchymal organs lends itself to the operation of different types of pattern-forming systems.
Relatively immobile epithelial cells produce and respond to diffusible signals, thus closely fitting
the framework offered by the Turing or reaction—diffusion system. Motile fibroblasts also produce
and respond to signals, but reside and move through the ECM, facilitating symmetry breaking
through chemotaxis or mechanical means. However, the behaviours of these systems in terms
of the patterns that they produce, their relationship to domain growth, and the types of pattern
