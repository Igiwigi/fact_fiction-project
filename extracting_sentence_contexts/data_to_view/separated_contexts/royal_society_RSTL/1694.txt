It was desirable, however, to ascer-
tain the exact temperature at which each of those three gases
unites with oxygen with the intervention of the spongy plati-
num. For this purpose the gases, mixed with oxygen enough
to saturate them, were 'severally exposed in small retorts
containing a platinum sponge, and immersed in a mercurial
bath, to a temperature which was gradually raised- till the
gases began to act on each other. In this way the following
facts were determined. 15t. Carbonic oxide began to be converted into carbonic
acid at a temperature between goo* and g10* FAHRENHEIT. By raising the temperature to g40*, and keeping it at that
point for 10 or 15 minutes, the whole of the gas was acidi-
fied, the condensation of volume in the mixture being equi-
valent to the' oxygen which had disappeared.
