1. Introduction

Rhythms are ubiquitous in biological systems, likely because their repetitive
nature enables anticipation and prediction. A major challenge is how to co-
ordinate between different rhythms both within an individual or between
individuals. The ecological importance of coordination is revealed by the fact
that either synchronous or asynchronous chorusing among conspecifics can
result from the relative contribution of cooperative and competitive constraints
[1,2]. In research, the range of coordination considered is restricted oftentimes
to the extreme limits of complete synchrony (coincidence of periodic events) or
a total lack of synchrony (random). Yet, there are also forms of interaction in
chorusing animals consisting of simple ratios or even patterns that are non-
isochronous yet coordinated [3]. Rhythms are also central to human action and
human auditory-based communication systems, namely music and language.
Within individuals, coordination of rhythms is also essential. In the action
domain, it is necessary to coordinate rhythmic movements across effectors in
order to locomote. Such behaviour has been studied extensively using bimanual
