In AIF terms, this ‘surprise’ signals information gain;
unexpected events are a prediction error from which the infant learns through active observation. Applied to educational
settings such as schools, this translates into a careful attention to the embedding experience of the learners through the design of
the materiality of learning (i.e. spaces and educational materials). We chose to focus on the MM because it is based on the idea that development and learning are in fact the same process,
underpinned by the active engagement of the pupils with their learning space.’ It describes an applied educational system
aiming at ‘optimal development’, rather than academic success as traditionally understood (e.g. [97-100]; see also [101,102]). While the MM theoretically insists on the materiality of learning as enabling and aiding cognitive functions, as other theories of


children’s development and learning (e.g. [101-106]), it is an applied ‘formal’ educational setting, essentially organized around
an indirect form of teaching, in which pupils develop and learn dynamically by repeatedly interacting with their learning

spaces and materials. Compared to today mainstream educational science that ‘has only recently started to pay due attention —S
to the significance of the material and spatial dimensions of learning’ ([107, p. 325]; see also [108]), the MM has a long-standing = =
tradition of so doing and has been deployed in a wide variety of cultural and social contexts (e.g. [109]; see also [110]). a
