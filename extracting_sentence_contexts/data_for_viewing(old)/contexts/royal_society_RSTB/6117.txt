and the palatine nerves run on their median side, whereas they run on the lateral side
of the infrapolar processes in birds. Since the infrapolar processes are free down-
growths from the polar cartilage, there is no reason why they should not grow inside
the palatine nerves in one case and outside them in another. Further, it is to be noticed
that in the crocodile the infrapolar processes do not fuse with the basal plate, but end
freely, and it would therefore be possible for the palatine nerves to slip over their free
ends and so assume a median position. The palatine nerves always run ventrally to
the basitrabecular process.

7. The Pila Antotica.—In the fully-formed chondrocranium of the bird, e.g., in the
fowl (Tonxorr, 1900), the posterior orbital cartilage is attached to the basal plate by
a cartilaginous pillar which passes between the profundus and the maxillary branches
of the trigeminal nerve. This condition is explained by the fact that an ‘additional
support, the pila antotica spuria, is developed in this position. A complete series can
thus be made out, fig. 24, from such a form as the crocodile, which possesses a pila
antotica (p.a.), and no pila antotica spuria (p.a.s.) ; here, as always, all the branches of
the trigeminal nerve pass out behind the pila antotica, fig. 24, A. At young stages,
fig. 24, B, the duck is precisely similar to the crocodile, and the pila antotica is typical.
Later, however, the pila antotica spuria is developed, fig. 24, C, and the profundus
branch (V 1) now emerges through a separate foramen. The sparrow is in this con-
dition, fig. 23. The next stage is represented by the fowl. fig. 24, D, where the pila
antotica spuria alone remains, the pila antotica disappearing, with the result that the
posterior orbital cartilage appears to be connected with the basal plate by a pila which
is in the wrong position for a pila antotica.
