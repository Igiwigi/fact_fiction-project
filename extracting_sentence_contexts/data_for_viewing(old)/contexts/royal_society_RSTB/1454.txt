overstep co-ordinating boundaries and communicate with each other, not only by the
usual channels, but also by channels not normally used for such transmission. The
result is a tetanus in co-ordinated muscles. Such a tumult in the spinal nerve-centres
is seen in strychnine poisoning.

We also know that when a muscle is over-stimulated, it passes into tetanus which,
being continued, passes into contracture and rigor mortis,

Now there must be a co-ordinating mechanism between the different fibres forming
a muscle. This mechanism must be localised in the nerve end-plates. Should
these end plates become hyper-esthetic from any cause, the ordinary inhibition of
co-ordination will be suspended, stimuli will be summated, and the muscle thrown
into varying degrees of tetanus or contracture. In fact, contracture might be
considered an epilepsy of the end plates.

The action of aldoxime upon curarised muscle is in favour of this view.

Curarised Muscle.—Curare greatly modifies the action of aldoxime. There is no
longer the ascent of the base-line, no shortening of the muscle in the form of
contracture. Aldoxime acts upon a fully-curarised muscle simply as a depressant.
There is a gradual loss of irritability and slight fall of the base-line.

It is known that curare paralyses the terminations of motor nerves in muscle. It —
would appear, therefore, to be a natural corollary to suppose that the veratrine-like —
action of aldoxime upon muscle is closely connected with the motor end plates. :
