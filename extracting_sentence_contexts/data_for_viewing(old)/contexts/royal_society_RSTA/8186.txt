cadmium light, of wave-length 6438-4698 A.U., the standard wave-length now generally
recognised (the mean of the values of MicneLson and of Benorr, Fanry and Perot),
might be taken as the recognised length of the British Imperial Standard Yard at 62° F
and 760 mm. pressure.

The relation between the yard and the metre, as determined non-interferometrically,
by Szars, Jounson and Jouty, namely 1 yard = 0-91439841 metre, and the mean of
MicHetson’s and Benorr, Fasry and Prrot’s values of the metre, 1553163-82 wave-
lengths of Cd,, can be used to calculate the number of wave-lengths of Cd, in the yard.
The result afforded by doing so is 1420210-5, a most satisfactory concordance with the
number now communicated.

Perhaps the most interesting fact about this investigation is that the author has been
able to measure a base-line of ,!;-inch, between Grayson-ruling fiducial limit-marks of
less than a half wave-length thickness, by direct counting of the interference bands,
5423 in neon light, which are comprised in this interval. Indeed, as this has been done

in duplicate, on two different sets of rulings, and the second has been transferred by the
comparator alongside the first, on to the adjacent (second) ,),-inch, the base-line has in
reality been the 10,846 bands in neon light (and corresponding numbers for hydrogen
light) contained in the }-inch, all directly counted, without any adventitious aids
whatever. The maximum counted by MicHEtson was 1626, as base-line for the metre,
