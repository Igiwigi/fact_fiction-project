2dly, Becauſe the whole reaſoning of Ptolemey,
in the fixth, ſeventh, eighth, ninth, tenth, and ele-
venth chapters, of his ſecond book, tends to reduce
the modes to the number of the ſpecies of the dia-
paſon; which, as far as his opinion goes, is an cx-
preſs confirmation, that the muſical doEtrine was a
doQtrine of the modes.

3dly, Becauſe Ptolemey is not ſingle in this opi-
nion, as ſome may have thought, but is ſupported
in it by the Ariſtoxenian writers, who, though they
admitted thirteen modes, upon the falſe principle of
the harmonic doctrine, did, in fact, reduce them to
eight, on the very principle of Ptolemey, calling the
Hyperionian mode, which gave the ſame ſpecies with
the Mixolydian, the acuter Mixolydian ; and calling
alſo the Xolian, the graver Lydian ; the Ionian, the
graver Phrygian ; the Hypozolian, the graver Hypo-
lydian; and the Hypoionian, the graver Hypophry-
gian ; the former of all which modes gave, re-
ſpectively, the ſame ſpecies with the latter. So that,
to make their dofrine anſwer to that of Ptolemey,
there wanted but the reduction of one mode more,
which was their Hyperphrygian. And it is not to be
eonceived, but that they ſaw this mode alſo to be a re-
