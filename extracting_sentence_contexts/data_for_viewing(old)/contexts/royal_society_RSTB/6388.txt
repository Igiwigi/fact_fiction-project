Diplosomoides lacazii (LAHILLE). This species was described by Laurie but has
not been rediscovered.

Its interest is that its development apparently bears the same relationship to that
of Diplosoma as does this last to that of Polysyncraton. The tadpole larva hatches
with not merely one but three blastozooids all as well developed as the oozoid, a
stage reached by Diplosoma a week or ten days after the tail of the tadpole has been
absorbed.

VIIâ€”GENERAL

Taken as a whole, the facts presented in the preceding sections form a somewhat
confusing picture, and it is only on analysis that certain significant correlations
appear.

Eggs of the same size may develop at the same rate or at different rates ; eggs of
different sizes may develop in the same time or may be widely different. Gastru-
lation may be embolic, epibolic, or intermediate between these two types. Tadpoles
may have beating hearts, and functional stigmata, and may form asexual buds, or
there may be no sign of any such structures. They may have a free-swimming
period lasting but a few minutes or some days.

The tadpole stage is by definition that stage wherein the transitory larval organs
have attained their maximum development and are functional. The notochord is
