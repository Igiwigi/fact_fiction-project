where the abbreviation im, = Wy, has been introduced [16]. Exemplarily, we will derive the
non-affine three-chain models that are close relatives of the original model and are obtained by
consideration of Taylor series or rational approximants for the inverse Langevin function, as well
as an alternative representation of non-Gaussian chain statistics.

(i) Taylor series and Gaussian chains
Expressing the inverse Langevin function in terms of a Taylor series approximation [19,54] leads
to strain-energy functions of the Ogden-model family

In general, these expressions do not have any advantage over the more general representation
(3.20). Nevertheless, they have an interesting implication: in fact, they suggest that one could
approximate the inverse Langevin function 2% —l(x) within a range of interest in terms of a
weighted sum of powers which are odd multiples of 1/£, i.e. YH wjx2-D/b, so as to obtain an
Ogden-type model with only integer powers. Such a model would bring advantages in terms
of the numerical treatment, since its strain-energy function could be represented in terms of
principal traces of C; see also [15].

(ii) Rational approximants of Zo

Further close relatives are obtained by consideration of some of the various rational function
approximations proposed for 2 —1 For example, using Cohen’s rounded Padé approximant [81]

Using more recent rational approximations (see e.g. [58]) clearly leads to various alternative forms
of the strain-energy function.

(iii) Alternative approximation of non-Gaussian chains

Khiém & Itskov [59] recently deviated from the Langevin statistical approach and used another
approximation to the non-Gaussian statistics of freely jointed chains, based on the model
proposed by Ilg [82].
