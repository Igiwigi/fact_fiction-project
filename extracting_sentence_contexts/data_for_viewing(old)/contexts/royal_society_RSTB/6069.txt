diffuse, non-deciduate placenta and he regarded all three as secondary. He frankly
admitted that he was unable to indicate how “ this simplification of a placenta of the
Insectivorous or Primate type down to that of the present Lemurs was brought about ”
(10, p. 115). AssHeTon (’10), however, did make an attempt to show how the Lemur
placenta might have been derived from such a deciduate placenta as is found in the
Carnivora, but most unsuccessfully as we think (Hix and Burne, ’22).

In his paper on the placentation of the Primates, Wistockt (’29) discusses the ques-
tion of the phylogeny of the placenta in Mammals generally and that of the Primates
in particular at considerable length, but without, we think, adding materially to its
solution. Whilst he admits that the hypothesis of the secondary derivation of the
Lemuroid placenta “is in no way established ” (p. 74), he considers that “ the observed
facts accord more with such a view than with the opposite one,” the acceptance
of which lands us, he says, in “‘ almost unsurmountable difficulties ” (p.74). One of these
difficulties, for the author, is that the Lemurs appear to be completely isolated “‘ among
groups in which the penetration of the trophoblast to form a labyrinthine placenta is
the cardinal feature ” (p. 79), and a second is that “we have to accept the rodents,
insectivores, Galeopithecus, Tupaja, Tarsius and the Simie as separate and individual
products from a stem which possessed a diffuse type of placentation ” (p. 74). His
general conclusions are that the placenta hemochorialis represents the most primitive
type (p. 77) and that “ the recent diffuse placentals, as well as their fossil prototypes . . .
appear to be, if the present hypothesis be true, quite independently derived from
mammals which possessed penetrating trophoblast ” (p. 79).

Wistocgt derives a considerable part of his support for these conclusions from the
