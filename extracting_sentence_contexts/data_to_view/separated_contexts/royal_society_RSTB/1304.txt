Tt must be observed, however, that these measures only roughly indicate eith
the size of the nucleus or the bulk of the protoplasm. The nucleus is generally
an oval body, and the “diameter” here given is the mean between the long and
short diameters as it presented itself in the specimen. In many cases the nucleus
would be seen endwise, hence the measure of size here given is in many cases too
small, Again, the number of chambers is only a rough indication of the bulk of
the protoplasm, for it takes no account of the size of the varying megalosphere, or of
the fact that in many specimens the terminal chambers are empty, a condition
due either to their contents having been extended in the form of pseudopodia, and
hence torn off when the specimen was collected, or to other causes. In the diagram two curves are given, The upper one embodies the results obtained
with 118 specimens preserved fresh from the sea in the months of May and June. The lower gives the results obtained from specimens kept in dishes in the laboratory
for three months, October to January.
