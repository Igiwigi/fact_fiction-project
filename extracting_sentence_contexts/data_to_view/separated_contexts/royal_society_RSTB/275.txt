B. SANDERSON ON THE ELECTROMOTIVE

generally happened that the lasting electrical relation between opposite points of its
upper and under surfaces underwent a gradual change, that is, the under surface
became more positive the longer the observation was continued. It was further
observed that in any leaf a similar modification could be brought about much more
rapidly by leading through the explored part a very weak voltaic current in the
direction of the after effect, that is, from the upper to the under surface. ,

These facts clearly indicated that what, in the language of pu Bors-Reymonp,
would be called the leaf current, that is, the lasting difference of potential between |
the two surfaces, has a physiological relation with the phenomena above referred to as.
constituting the excitatory disturbance. As regards the nature of that relation, it
seemed to be indicated that it was in accordance with what, in animal physiology, is
called the “ pre-existence theory ” of the same physiologist ; that is, that the “excitatory
variation ” (see above) is not to be regarded as the setting up of a new electromotive
action (action current of Hermann), but as the result of a sudden diminution of a
previously existing electromotive force (in the language of pu Bois-Reymonp, a
negative variation of the leaf current). On this question, much light has been thrown since the publication of my last paper
by the progress of experimental investigation in animal physiology, and particularly by
the investigation of the electromotive properties of the ventricle of the heart of the Frog.
