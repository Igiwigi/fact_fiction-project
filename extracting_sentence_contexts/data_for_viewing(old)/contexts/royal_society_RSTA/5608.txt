weak correlations between neighbouring multipliers make all moments of the amplitude finite,
overcoming divergency due to exponential tails of P(«). While the body and the (trivial) left tail iS
of H(X/k) can be computed neglecting weak correlations between the multipliers, the positive [S
moments (|a|1) = [ dX exp[Xq — kH(X/k)] are determined by the far right tail of H, which must be :3

9. Conclusion a

This note weaves together three threads introduced by Uriel Frisch into turbulence studies:
criterion for cascade direction, breakdown of self-similarity, and multi-fractal formalism. The away
universal family of models (2.7) introduced here provides for a unique possibility to use : ae
perturbative approach in a system with strong interaction. That possibility is based on the aa)
remarkable fact that thermal equilibrium has exactly Gaussian statistics with independent modes; DN
varying the parameter of our family, one is able to study turbulence close to thermal equilibrium. 28

For our models or velocities in hydrodynamics, the results shed light on what is crucial for the :&
breakdown of scale invariance in the statistics of amplitudes. The statistics deviates from Gaussian
as one goes into the cascade, as long as the interaction time decreases, regardless whether the
cascade is direct or inverse.

Shell models in general and our family in particular demonstrate that turbulence is
qualitatively different from ore pulverization [34]. In the latter case, the assumption of the
statistical independence of multipliers makes sense. In turbulence, not only multipliers are
correlated but their equations of motion are explicitly not translation invariant, while the
equations on the amplitudes are. And yet, the amplitudes do not have the translation-
