Hence it was natural to imagine that in passing from the parts
of the hemisphere where the regular solar variation predominated, by reason of its
greater amount, to other parts where the disturbance-variation should predominate,
differences, of the nature of the s0-called anomalies, would present themselves in the
tesults which should comprehend their joint effects. Still, however, in attempting, with
the yery limited knowledge that was then possessed of the differences that might be sup-
posed to take place in the disturbance-variation in different localities, to apply this mode
of explanation to particular cases, doubts have been entertained of its sufficiency to meet
the phenomena in all cases. The fact which has now been established by the compa-
Tison. of the disturbances at Point Barrow and Toronto, that the prevailing disturbance-

deflection at certain hours of the day may be easterly at one station whilst it is westerly
at another, augments the probability, that, whenever the effects of the two classes of
phenomena are separated 80 that the approximate laws of each may be known, the
apparent anomalies will disappear, and the solar variation will be found, after the
disturbance-variation has been eliminated, to correspond in its times of easterly and
westerly elongation with the order of the phenomena as generally observed in the same
hemisphere: whilst on the other hand we may derive from the great dissimilarity in the
laws of the disturbance-variation and those of the regular solar variation the salutary
caution, that until the disturbance-variation at any particular station has become known by
actual investigation, no certain inference can be drawn as to its direction or amount at
different hours ; or as to the modification of the turning-hours which its junction with
the 80lar-diurnal variation may produce. The subjoined Table (V.) exhibits in parallel columns the diurnal variation at Point
Barrow as derived, â€”1, in column A, from the whole of the observations including the
disturbances; it is here the joint effect of both classes of phenomena ; and 2, in column B,
from the observations when the disturbed observations have been separated and omitted. On comparing these two columns, it is seen that the time of westerly extreme, which,
when the whole of the observations are taken into account, falls as late as 11 P.M., is
restored in column B, which represents approximately the regular solar-diurnal yariation,
to the same hour at which it occurs at Toronto, viz.
