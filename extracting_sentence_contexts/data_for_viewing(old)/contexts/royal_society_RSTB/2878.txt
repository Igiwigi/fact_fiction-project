and the Ophioglossaceze. It must be clearly apprehended that the groups thus
disposed are not held to be a simple evolutionary sequence, their relations to one
another and to primitive forms (Protopteridophyta), which in my view were probably
strobiloid and microphyllous, is suggested roughly by the following scheme :—

Equiseta. Lycopods. Psilotaceze. Sphenophylleee Ophioglossacex, — Filices.

Protopteridophyta.

The view that the strobiloid type is the fundamental one harmonises with the
anatomical facts. The non-medullated protostele is generally accepted by anatomists
as the primitive arrangement in the axis; it is found still among the Lycopods,
persistent in the mature individual. But even large-leaved Ferns of most complex
mature structure, such as the Marattiacese, show a single solid protostele in the
young plant.* The same is the case generally in the young state of Leptosporangiate
Ferns, and even in the mature condition of some of them. It is so sometimes in the
young plant of Helminthostachys, but “more usually a few parenchymatous cells are
present in it.”{ This is the case also in Botrychium virginanum§ and in Eyuisetum.||
The medullated monostele is usually regarded as an advance upon the protostele,
though in the cases quoted the difference is a very slight one. Other more complex
arrangements, which it is unnecessary to follow into detail here, may arise later in
the individual lives, and will appear to be natural consequences of leaf-enlargement in
individual or race; the point for us is that in all the great groups of Pteridophytes
