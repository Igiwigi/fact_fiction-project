Sterilisation.

The sterilisation of potentially sporogenous cells, that is, the conversion of cells
of common origin with sporogenous cells, and which in other cases, or under
other circumstances would form spores, into vegetative cells, is an essential feature
in the antithetic theory. It is a fact illustrated in the sporophyte of the most
various plants.* It should, however, be pointed out at once that the facts of
sterilisation are compatible with either of the above views as to the origin of
the sporophyte; the difference between the two views lies in the extent to which
it is held that sterilisation has been operative in the past. The antithetic theory
proceeds on the ground that all vegetative tissues of the sporophyte ultimately
originated by sterilisation of potentially fertile cells. On the homologous view
sterilisation has only played a secondary part. For the Bryophyta the balance of
probability seems to be strongly in favour of an. antithetic origin of the sporophyte,
with sterilisation as a leading and essential factor in its evolution. In the
Pteridophyta, owing to their extensive vegetative system, it is less obvious how the
sporophyte originated ; opinion must be based on detailed observation and comparison,
such as it has been the object of these Memoirs to provide. It has recently been
