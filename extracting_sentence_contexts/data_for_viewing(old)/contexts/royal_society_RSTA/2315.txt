Remarkably, the characterization of the quantum behaviours is similar for Bell scenarios
(in which we do not assume that measurements are ideal) and for KS scenarios (in which all
measurements are ideal by definition). This reflects the fact that any quantum behaviour for a
Bell scenario can be attained with ideal measurements. This follows from Neumark’s (also named
Naimark’s) dilation theorem [30-34] that states that every generalized measurement in quantum
theory (represented by a positive-operator valued measure (POVM)) can be implemented as an
ideal quantum measurement (represented by a projection-valued measure (PVM)) on a larger
Hilbert space. In a Bell scenario, any local POVM x admits a local dilation to a PVM that is
common to every context in which x appears. Because of this, the set of quantum behaviours for
the Bell CHSH scenario is identical to set of quantum behaviours for the KS scenario involving
four two-outcome ideal measurements and having a square as graph of compatibility. And
similarly for every Bell scenario.
