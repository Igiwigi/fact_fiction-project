The spinal cord of the Cat being divided in the mid-dorsal region, the upper end_
of the dorso-lumbar portion was prepared for connection with the electrometer, whilst
the lower tendon of the rectus femoris muscle was cut and attached to one of Ficx’s |
spring recording levers (isometric method). The cord was then exposed over the
dorso-lumbar junction and the lateral column excited with stimuli of varying degrees
of intensity. It is obvious that electrical changes thus produced in the cord are due
(a) to the excitation of continuous fibres joining the excited portion of the lateral
column with the observed region, (b) to the excitation of indirect fibres in the
lateral column, internuncial or otherwise, (c) to the discharge of nerve impulses
up the cord from the aroused centres.

The main interest of the experiment lies in the fact that with a weak stimulus no
muscular effects were observed, although distinct electrical effects were produced;
whilst with a strong stimulus the centres in the cord were so aroused that they
continued to discharge after the stimulus had ceased, these discharges being evidenced

both by muscular contractions and by effects in the electrometer.

The following Table indicates this result :—
