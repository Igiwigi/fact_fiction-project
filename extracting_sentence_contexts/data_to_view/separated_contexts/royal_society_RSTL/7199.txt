From the Arctic Ocean we had but very few specimens of P. Micheliniana, owing to
the paucity of deep-sea soundings. In the North Atlantic it is very common ; and
generally very rough or scabrous in its shell-tissue ; in fact it may be said to be here
P. truncatulinoides, D'Orb., sp. (For. Canar. pl. 2. figs. 25-27), and the two forms are
scarcely worth separating by distinct names. On the Irish marginal plateau it is rare and small in the shallow, rather common and
large in the deep parts.
