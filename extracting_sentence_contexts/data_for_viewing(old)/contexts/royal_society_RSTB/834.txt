may be diminished by a change in the distribution of the blood, so that these
tissues which are of vital importance to the economy are supplied richly with blood,
while those organs whose function can be temporarily interrupted without harm to
the system, as, for example, the kidney, spleen, and digestive system are rendered
anemic, their vessels contracting strongly when the supply of oxygen in the blood
is diminished. Now, the two organs of the body whose supply of oxygenated blood
cannot be interrupted, even temporarily, without danger to the system are the central
nervous system and the heart. The brain during asphyxia is enormously congested,*
while, by the action of the vagus nerve, the tissue waste of the heart, and, therefore,
the amount of oxygen which it requires, is reduced as low as is compatible with a
continuance of the circulation. This explanation of the changes in the heart and
circulation which take place during asphyxia is teleological, but seems to us so
obvious in view of the facts before us, that we have not hesitated to state it.

It is possible that the indigestion and scanty urine in patients suffering from heart-
failure may be, in part, due to the constriction of the walls of the blood-vessels of the
kidneys and digestive tract-—which, as we have seen, takes place so surely in asphyxia
—although it is possible that these phenomena of heart-failure are due exclusively to
the fall of arterial and rise of venous pressures.

CONCLUSION.

In the foregoing pages we have sought to state as clearly as lay in our power
the principal results of the long series of observations which we have made on the
nervous and other mechanisms of the Mammalian heart. Our communication is, to
