The nerves of sensation in which are included, of course, the nerves of the external
senses, and the immediate organs of the sensorial powers are not parts of the same
organ, but distinet parts, having different localities and performing functions of a
wholly different nature; that is, the sensorium does not pervade the whole system,
but belongs to particular parts. To what parts has never been correctly ascertained,
but we know that in man they are confined to certain parts of the brain with little if
any participation by the spinal marrow ; although in some of the inferior animals the
spinal marrow largely partakes of them, a proof that the sensorium is not as some
have s8upposed confined to a physical point, but is of a considerable extent,

Our sensations are referred to certain parts of the body by experience alone. Hence
the well-known facts that infants are not aware of the part of the body in which the
cause of any sensation originates ; and when a limb has been lost, at whatever part
the zeparation is made, we continue to refer to the lost part sensations excited by
causes affecting the nerves of the stump.

The function of the nerves of sensation has relation to the sensorial organs alone.
The influence they convey is the means by which the sensorium is impressed by
distant parts, and such is their only function,

The more perfect animals then possess four distinct powers, having no direct de-
pendence on each other, but each we shall find indirectly dependent on the other
three, namely for the maintenance of its organs.
