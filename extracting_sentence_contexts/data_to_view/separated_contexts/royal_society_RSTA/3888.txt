The models with stabilization do a much better job for the GP-16 and
GA-02 sections, perform similarly to those with greater absolute Fe fluxes for GA-03 and
overestimate the hydrothermal anomaly for the CoFeMUG section. This suggests the need for an
improved process-level understanding of biogeochemical processes occurring at different ridge
crests and within their associated plumes; this includes understanding the nature, abundance and
ultimate impact of Fe stabilization. Taken at face value, stabilization of Fe within plumes appears
less important for the Atlantic sections, but this may rather reflect the fact that there is at present
no study mapping the extent of hydrothermal plumes in the Atlantic Ocean (as has been done in
the Pacific). Indeed, the distal signal of hydrothermal Fe seen in the GA-02 transect that occurred
away from any known ridge site does require stabilization for our model to be able to reproduce
it. On the other hand, the CoOFeMUG and GA-03 sections were zonal and sampled across both the
ridge crest and the prevailing meridional transport.
