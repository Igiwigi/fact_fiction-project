Another key aspect is that, even at : S
relatively high melt proportion, crystals may form force chains that can sustain yield strength 783

[121,123]. A consequence of force chains is that the mechanical transition from melt to mush
occurs at relatively low crystal proportions [123]. At mid-ocean ridges, the fact that crystallization
is dominated by plagioclase, which has a large degree of shape anisotropy, promotes low ¢¢ [122]
and hence early mush formation: natural and experimental observations suggest that plagioclase-
dominated systems may behave mechanically like a mush at relatively low crystal content
(approx. 20-25% [122,123]). Such modal proportion is strikingly similar to the fraction of crystals
that have formed from MORBs at lower crustal pressure by the time it reaches clinopyroxene
saturation (22% in the Indian MORB modelled in §3a; see fig. 13 in [34]). Hence, by the time
clinopyroxene crystallizes, it does so within an olivine + plagioclase framework.
