Hence it appeared probable that the diffusive power, as well as the con-
centrating, had been paralysed by the ammonia, but had been recovered in all the area
except the part that was likely to be the last to regain its functions. To ascertain
whether the concentrating power had also been regained, I killed the frog and ampu-
tated the leg; s00n after which the usnal post mortem concentration took place com-
Pletely in the web generally, while in the central part of the area the medium state was
ï¬†ill retained, and in the rest of its extent concentration considerably beyond the medium
state, but short of the full degree, supervened, showing that recovery of function had
taken place to a considerable extent, but was not yet quite complete. I now felt little doubt that chloroform also possessed the power of arresting the pig-
mentary functions ; but in order to prove the fact I killed a dark frog, and placed one
