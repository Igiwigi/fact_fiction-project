Birds die almost instantly on being submerged in water ; the mammalia
survive about three minutes, the reptiles and the batrachia a much greater
length of time. The unborn fetus, the young animal born with the foramen: oyale open, the
reptile, the mollusca, having all a state of the heart approaching to the veno-
contractile, bear a long-continued snspension of the respiration, compared with
the mature animal of the higher classes. But the most remarkable fact deducible from this reasoning is the follow-
ing: ifsuch a case existed as that of the left side of the heart being nearly or
absolutely yeno-contractile, such an animal would bear the indefinite suspen-

sion of respiration such an animal would not drown though immersed in
water. Now there is precisely such a case.
