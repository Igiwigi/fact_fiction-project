ties in the Himalayan fauna.

Yet one more case of peculiar distribution deserves brief recognition. It is, of
course, a well-known fact that there are in the Indian Peninsula numerous
representatives of African animals. The majority of these, however, are forms like
Hyena, Mellivora, Gazella, amongst mammals ; Pterocles, Eupodotis, Phanicopterus,
amongst birds; Chameleon and Eryx, amongst reptiles—to quote a few well-known
examples only—and in these cases the Indian and African forms are connected by
species which inhabit South-western Asia and the Mediterranean area. Instances,
such as Golunda amongst mammals, Salpornis and Rhinoptilus amongst birds, of
genera only known in tropical Africa and India are much less common.

Now it is a noteworthy fact that there are a few genera or larger groups inhabiting
India, the nearest allies of which are found, not in Africa, but in tropical America.
There are several similar cases of a connection between the Eastern part of the
Indo-Malay region and the Neotropical, as in the case of the genus Tapirus, but the
most striking examples are amongst Invertebrata. Two of these may be noticed.
One is that of the Thelyphonide,* or whip-scorpions, a family of Arachnida which
inhabit Southern India and Ceylon (not Northern India or the Himalayas), Burma,
and the Eastern Indo-Malay region, including the Malay Archipelago, with the Papuan
area as far as the New Hebrides and Fiji Islands. They also occur in tropical
America, but not in Africa. The second case is even more curious. It consists in
the recent discovery by Mr. Daty of a species of the bivalve mollusk Muelleria
inhabiting rivers in Mysore.t Now Muelleria is one of the South American
members of the Atheriide, a family allied to the Unionidee, which are freshwater
