Plate 1. fig. 3 is drawn from an egg removed from the brood-pouch. It is now gra-
nular in the body owing to the inception of deutoplasm, and has undergone impregnation,
This is inferred from the fact that it is enclosed in a transparent enyelope or egg-shell
of membranous consistency. The nucleus and nucleolus scen now in the egg may or
may not be the original germinal yesicle and spot of the egg-cell. Though these
structures disappear in some eggs, it cannot be asserted that they may not be persistent
in others.
