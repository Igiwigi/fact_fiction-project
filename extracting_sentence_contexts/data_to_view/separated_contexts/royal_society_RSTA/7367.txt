values of y/, but since their periods for y = 8-5 and 18:5° agree well with the periods obtained
in this work for the complementary angles, it is likely that either in the present work or in
theirs the tetragonal axis has been wrongly identified. This interpretation is confirmed by
the fact that opposite signs are found for the steady anisotropy (see table 11), and since the
present sign is confirmed by Verhaeghe, Vandermeerssche & Le Compte (1950) it is
probable that the mistake is not in the present work. As with cadmium the Russian results
indicate a much larger amplitude than in the present work (something like 5 or 10 times) ;
this discrepancy is probably due more to the large size (about 1cm length) of the present
specimen than to the quality of the crystal, since the Laue spots were considerably better
than in cadmium. TABLE 7.
