of bladder, and inverted a funnel-mouthed tube over one of then, (the box
being previously filled with water slightly acidulated,) I connected the plates
with the ends of a battery of thirty pair of plates. The hydrogen disengaged
in three minutes was found to occupy about two inches and a half of the tube.
The plates were now connected with one hundred and twenty plates of the
same battery, and the decomposition allowed to go on for the same time; when
it was found that the hydrogen collected was scarcely double that in the
first experiment. Now the number of plates being as one to four, and the
quantity of hydrogen nearly as one to two, we have the effects nearly as the
square roots of the number of plates. By increasing the number of plates to
a great extent, we should find, agreeably to a remark in Q 10 of Part First,
that the increase of effect would not go on 80 rapidly as the square root of the
number of plates. 'This fact, which follows from theory, is strikingly confirmed
by direct experiment.

17. The theoretical views now unfolded are strikingly confirmed by the
application of the torsion galyanometer in the following experiment.

plates; metallic contact between the copper plates and the ends of the battery
