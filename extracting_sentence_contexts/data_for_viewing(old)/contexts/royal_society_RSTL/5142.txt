which the sensibility observed appeared to have any connexion with the colouring
matter. The paler glasses exhibited a little internal dispersion, because the colour
was not sufficiently intense to mask the dispersion which a common colourless glass
would exhibit.

168. The exception occurred in the case of the pale brown glass, which has been
already mentioned in connexion with my first experiment. This glass dispersed a
red light under the influence of the highly refrangible rays. The colour of the light

Was not pure prismatic red, but red was predominant. A similar dispersion, due
Sapparently to the same cause, was observed in the case of one of the common reddish
gbrown German wine bottles. The sensibility of these glasses appears to be due to
Zan alkaline sulphuret. A bead purposely coloured in this manner was in fact found
Ea disperse a red light like the glasses. Moreover, in the confused masses obtained
=Ã¾v fusing sulphate of soda and sulphate of potash on charcoal before the blowpipe,
Scertain portions were found which dispersed a red light, and that pretty copiously
for an inorganic substance. A similar dispersion was observed among the products
obtained by fusing together sulphur and carbonate of potash, while other parts of the
Fronfued mass exhibited dispersion of a different kind. It seems plain that among
othe combinations of sulphur with the alkalies sensitive compounds exist, but what

Sthey are I have not examined.
