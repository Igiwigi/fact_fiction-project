As already stated, the climax of the eruption was heralded in some
places by showers of hot mud, or wet, hot ashes, which scalded not a few people. But
on the leeward side the day was essentially dry, and at Kingstown, though the ash at
first fell wet, there were no rains of any consequence. It is not a little remarkable
that the discharge of such enormous quantities of water vapour into the air should not
have been accompanied by condensation or precipitation on a large scale; but, what-
ever may be the reasons for it, the fact remains that the great eruption of the
Soufri√©re was essentially a dry eruption. When the great black cloud was seen rushing out to sea past Chateaubelair, even
those whom courage, or a sense of duty, or helplessness, had led to linger in the
village, were struck with one impulse to eseape. We have some graphic narratives of
that flight, which give us a picture of the demoralisation of the black population and
the terrors of the eruption, so vivid as to be worth reproducing here.
