AS the point having (x, y, 2) for its coordinates will be a point on the surface of the sphere,
Q and (the last-mentioned equation always subsisting) the equation £7 +74+&=0 will be
S a great circle of the sphere ; and since we are only concerned with the ratios of E, 7, Z.
= we may also asxume E*+#*+£&=1. We may of course retain in the formule the expres-
= $ions a+ +2? and ZP+#* +2, without substituting for these the values unity, and it is
Z, in fact convenient thus to preserye all the formulee in their original forms. We have
S thus a system of spherical geometry ; and it appears that the Absolute in such system is
& the (spherical) conic, which is the intersection of the sphere with the concentric cone
2 or eyanescent sphere z*+y*+2*=0. The cireumstance that the Absolute is a proper
= conic, and not a mere point-pair, is the real ground of the distinction between spherical
[= geometry and ordinary plane geometry, and the cause of the complete duality of the
*> theorems of spherical geometry.
