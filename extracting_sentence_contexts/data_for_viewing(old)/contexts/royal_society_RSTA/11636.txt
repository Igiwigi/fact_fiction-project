§ 15. On Currents due to Evaporation and Precipitation.

A cause which has been advocated* in explanation of ocean currents is the
fact that in equatorial regions the amount of water evaporated into the atmosphere
largely exceeds that precipitated in the form of rain in these regions. The excess of
water in the atmosphere is carried away to be precipitated in temperate and polar
regions, thereby giving rise to an excess of precipitation over evaporation in the
latter regions. It has been urged with some reason that, as the actual amount
of water in equatorial regions does not diminish nor that in polar regions increase
from year to year, there must be a continual flow of water from the poles towards
the equator. The fact that this flow of water is in the opposite direction to
that observed at the surface, which for the most part sets from the equator towards
the poles, is explained by attributing the counterflow to undercurrents. If however
we subject the question to the test of mathematical analysis, we shall find that
though such a flow towards the equator must necessarily exist, it is so slow as to be
completely masked by larger currents due to other causes. ‘The flow in question
will however give rise indirectly, in consequence of the rotation, to currents which
in the absence of dissipative forces would tend to increase without limit. The
explanation of this fact will be obvious after the discussions of § 11.

The effects of evaporation and precipitation may be conveniently represented
mathematically by an appropriate distribution of sources and sinks over the free
surface. This will modify the surface-conditions at the free surface but will not
