and similarly for the remainder. As nothing hangs on the discussion of these quantities, it is not worth
writing out any more. In fact, the only application of the investigation to the present case would be to
show that the transformations in Art. 9 are always possible, provided a sufficiently short length of the curve
be taken ; that is, to show that it is always possible to choose %» %9, 23, &c., so that none of them vanish
for any value of x between the limits of integration. But it is easier to see that this is, in general, the
case from the equations obtained for 1) 2a) #3, &e., in the course of the transformations themselves.
