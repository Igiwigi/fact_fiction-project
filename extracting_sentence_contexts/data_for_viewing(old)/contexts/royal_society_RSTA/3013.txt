If we have a composite system made up of some finite number of different types of subsystems,
then our reference frame is simply the tensor product of the reference frames for each type of
subsystem. Using our previous results, we can approximately implement any single-subsystem
unitary. To implement any two-subsystem unitary between subsystems A and B, we (i) consider
those two subsystems as a composite system, and (ii) use the same procedure as before on this
composite system and a similar composite system in the reference frame (hence involving only
four primitive subsystems). For example, to implement exp(—ia(o ®@ of?) /N)), we would apply
exp(—i(w/N) SWAPs, 2, SWAPs,,R,) to the state ps,s, ® (ol ® a1”) ay: Once we can perform
any two-subsystem unitary, we can use standard techniques to construct a circuit to implement
any unitary on the system up to the desired accuracy.*

If the subsystems are all of the same type, then an alternative approach would be to
use (i) the fact that Unyp = /SWAP is an entangling two-subsystem gate which commutes
with all conserved quantities, and (ii) that such a gate plus all single subsystem unitaries is
computationally universal [26]. This would require only bipartite interactions, with the caveat
of a more complicated construction.

4. An application to quantum thermodynamics

Although the reference frame construction above could be of use in many different scenarios,
one interesting application is to quantum thermodynamics with multiple conserved quantities

“In particular, we can apply the approach in [25] (generalized to arbitrary dimension) based on two-level unitaries built
from controlled unitary gates on two subsystems. We can then bound the total error by appropriately bounding the error on
each gate.
