be merely the original transyerse curyes at its upper end, modified by transmission, or
may be attributable to the great transyerse pressure to which that glacier must be sub-
jected at certain points of its course. If the dirt-bands are entirely formed at the upper
part of the glacier and are there coincident with the curves of transyerse structure, and
if they als remain coincident with them at distant points of the glacier, then, since the
dirt-bands must necessarily be transmitted forms, the curyes must almost necessarily be
80 likewise. Principal ForBss's theory of the dirt-bands would not lead to the same
conclusion.

59. The Pressure Theory and the Differential Motion Theory of the Veined Structure
compared.â€”The pressure theory of the yeined structure, s0 far as it asserts the perpen-
dicularity of such surfaces to the directions of maximum pressure, appears to be in perfect
accordance with observed facts and mechanical deductions, whether the structure be
marginal, transverse, or longitudinal. The transversal directions and approximate verti-
cality of the structural surfaces at the bottoms of ice-falls, and the general existence
of the structure wherever the glacier must, from the conditions under which it is placed,
be subject to great pressure, are also perfectly consistent with this theory. We may
also remark that the evidence of facts in fayour of it is in a great measure independent
of the degree of efficiency which may ultimately be attributed to the transmission of the
structural forms. IT am not, indeed, aware of any leading observed facts of the veined
structure inconsistent with this theory.

With respect to the Differential Theory, the whole of the mechanical reasoning on
which it is based is professedly popular, vague, and undemonstrative, and, I believe, as
erroneous as such reasoning must almost necessarily be in cases as intricate as those
