, really, no doubt, of the same nature—was already recognized as being probably a root
(loc. cit., fig. 7). «

A number of better preserved specimens also showing these organs in connection
with the stem have since been obtained. These afford evidence—

. That the appendages in question were of endogenous origin, and presented in all
respects the characteristic structure of roots.

2. That these roots are identical with the fossil previously described as Kalowylon
Hookeri.

We will first state the facts which prove that the appendages are morphologically
roots.

Adventitious roots, with the rarest exceptions, are of endogenous origin ; they arise
from deep-seated tissues (pericycle or endodermis), and have to grow out through the
cortex of the parent stem. Hence they are readily distinguished from stem-branches,
which are almost always of exogenous origin, arising from superficial tissues. A
section of the cortex of the parent stem, passing through the base of an adventitious
Toot, will show the latter as a complete organ, possessing a cortex and epidermis of
its.own; a. corresponding section at the base of a branch would show only the
vascular tissues, which connect the bundles of the branch with those of the stem.

We have the clearest evidence that the appendages of the Lyginodendron stem were
