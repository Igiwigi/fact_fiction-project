The lowness of the yield-point in the
present case, was probably due to an inherent weakness in the specimen, which was
shown by the small flaw which ran up the centre of the bar.* Owing to the specimen
having been turned down this weakness would exert a greater influence than when
the bar was of the full diameter of 1 inch. Experiments on another specimen of the
same material, in fact, directly showed that after turning down a yield-point was
obtained, at a stress lower than that to which the specimen had already been sub-
jected without other than elastic yielding resulting. Such behaviour was anomalous. With other material which exhibited no flaw, turning down was found to have no
effect on the position at which subsequent yielding took place.
