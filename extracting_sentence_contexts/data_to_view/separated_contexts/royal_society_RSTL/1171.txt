On
the south pole being presented, they receded from it. I will not indulge myself by entering far into the theoretical
part of this subject ; but a number of curious speculations can-

. not fail to present themselves to every philosophical mind, in
consequence of the facts developed ; such as whether the
magnetism of the earth may not be owing to its electricity,
and the variation of the needle to. the alterations in the elec-
trical currents of the earth in consequence of its motions,
internal chemical changes, or its relations to solar heat ; and
whether the luminous effects of the auroras at the- poles are
not shown, by these new facts, to depend on electricity. This
is evident, that if strong electrical currents be supposed to
follow the apparent course of the sun, the magnetism of the
earth ought to be such as it is found to be.
