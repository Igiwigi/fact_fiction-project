What their nature can be T have not the
ghtest idea, neither have I met anything similar to them elsewhere among the Nema-
ods. In those Ascarides having the above-mentioned arrangement of their excretory
tubes, a body of this kind seems always to exist on the left side of the arch, and at the
same time the walls of the vessel on this side are generally much thicker than on the
other. What relationship there is, however, between these two facts I am unable to
Say, and it seems very difficult to explain why one ide of the arch should be larger than
the other. The most extreme divergence between the two sides exists in 4. marginata,
In which animal these canals are remarkable, not only for the thickness of their walls,
but also for their great proportionate size as compared with that of their containing
bands (Plate XXVI. fig. 2). In 4. mystaz, on the contrary (Plate XXVI. fig. 4), the
Yeazels have about the same proportionate development as in 4. lumbricoides.
