Let y;, be the spectral abscissa of the mth equation
Em(t) = —AmkpSm(l) + AmkrSn(t —h), m= Tn. (2.12)
Then, if y;, < 0 for m =2,n, system (2.3) is exponentially stable around the consensus state of the network. Proof. Note from theorem 2.3 that the stability problem for (2.8) can be decomposed into the
study of the n equations

Emly, t) = (7 — Amkp)Em(7, 6) + dmky eEm(y, th), m= Tn. (2.13)

Due to the fact that (2.3) and (2.8) are equivalent when y =0, it follows that the stability of
X(t) = (0, t) in (2.3) can also be decomposed into the study of the n equations én(t) = (0, t)
in (2.12). Let y be the spectral abscissa associated with ¢,(t) then, by definition, y* =
maxj<m<n{Y;,}. As per remark 2.5, the case m=1 can be ignored in the stability analysis and
hence, the proof is completed by noticing that y,;, < 0, m1 =2,n ensures y* <0. a

Corollary 2.6 states that separately analysing the y-stability of the individual scalar systems
in (2.12) is equivalent to analysing the y-stability of the complete system (2.3).
