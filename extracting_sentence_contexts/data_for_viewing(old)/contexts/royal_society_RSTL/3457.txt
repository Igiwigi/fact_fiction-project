operation, destined to bring most of them into contact with the membrane F, and at
the same time to convey the elliptic cell into a like situation. This process consisted
in the gradual formation of a cavity at a certain part of the interior (se the figure).
Usually, however, I have seen the changes in question to take place in the manner
represented in my last memoiry.

363. During the changes referred to in the two preceding paragraphs, the cells no
doubt multiply by the origin of new ones in their interior||, and in proportion to the
extent of surface (F) which they are required to line. There is every reason for sup-
posing that subsequently also, after reaching this situation, they increase in number
by the same means.

364. The facts above recorded will show that I am not enabled to confirm B1-
SCHOFF'S Conjecture, referred to in my last memoir: © that in the first place all the
yelk-granules are inclosed in two, then in four, then in eight, &c. cells.” But these
facts strengthen the analogy pointed out in that memoir, between the early changes
in the oyum of the Mammifera and the divisions previously known to occur in the
oyum of Batrachian Reptiles, and some other animals ; and it is almost superfluous
to add, that I 8uppose the process in all to be essentially the same44, and that it is in
operation in the ova of other animals##. I believe it has hitherto been usnal to re-
