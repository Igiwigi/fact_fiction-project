Further details on the general O(1/N*) and O(1/N) bounds

Here, we provide more detailed technical proof of our O(1/N ?) and O(1/N) bounds, showing that
they are indeed bounded in the required sense, and giving an explicit bound in each case showing
their dependence on the various constants. In the first case, we wish to show that

|txivors @oVE) ~ (os -ikto-esl)], <0(5)- (D1)

where Vy = exp(—i(w/N)SWAP). Expanding Vy and Vi as power series in 1/N and using (3.3),
we obtain

where we have used the fact that the trace norm satisfies ||trg{O4B}ll1 < ||Oaslla [27] and ||Al|1 =

Hence, ||trr{Vaps @ o Vt} — (ps — i(a/N)[o, ps})\]1 = O(1/N?). Note that this is not the tightest
provable bound, and a higher threshold for N can generate a smaller (yet more complicated)
constant, but this is not the focus of this paper.
