the return ignitor shock was predicted in the stagnation phase [115,116] but has not yet been
investigated further experimentally [117]. Whereas we have emphasized above the detrimental
effects of hydrodynamics instabilities and mix for ICF, let us now underline some fascinating
results acquired recently in the context of basic and discovery science experiments.

3. Turbulent hydrodynamics for laboratory astrophysics and fundamental high-
energy-density hydrodynamics

(a) Laboratory astrophysics

The opportunities offered by high-power lasers to mimic astrophysical phenomena in the
laboratory were recognized in the late 1990s [118,119]. Similarity scaling based on Euler equations
[120,121] has been improved to include the effects of radiation [122]. In fact, the advent of MJ high
power lasers has enabled a booming new field of research in which astrophysical environments
can be scaled down to laboratory dimensions yet preserve the essential physics via self-similar
transformations of the governing equations. The stabilizing effect of radiation on the RTI has been
demonstrated on NIF in conditions relevant for young supernovae remnants [123,124]. This is the
culmination of a long thought research project [125-127]. Efforts are still underway to increase
the spatial resolution of the x-ray radiographs with point-projection short pulse wire backlighters
[128,129], with the aim of taking advantage of short pulse backlighter capabilities like the
advanced radiographic capability (ARC) laser system at the NIF [130] or Petawatt Aquitaine Laser
(PETAL) on LMJ [131]. These additional laser beamlines, based on OPCPA (Optical Parametric
Chirped Pulse Amplification) technology [132], are extremely useful for generating bright X-ray
sources [130] or protons beams [133] used, for example, to probe magnetized HED plasmas [134].
