of the axis collectively suffice to justify this reference. The genus will, no
doubt, eventually have to be broken up, as our knowledge of the organs of fructifi-
cation increases, and we become better able to correlate them with the vegetative
parts; the time is hardly ripe for such a rearrangement at present.*

A number of fructifications referable to Sphenophyllum, or at least closely allied,
have now been described ; the most important are Sphenophyllum Dawsoni, Bowmanites
Rémeri, and Sphenophyllum majus. Of these, Bowmanites Rimeri appears to have
most in common with our fossil. This fructification, our knowledge of which is
entirely due to the work of Count Soums-LauBacu,t was not definitely placed by that
author in the genus Sphenophyllum, though there is no doubt as to its close affinity.
As the structure of the axis is not yet known, it is wise to keep this species at present
in the provisional genus Bowmanites.{ The fact that in B. Rémeri each sporangio-
phore bears two sporangia is in itself a striking point of resemblance to Sphenophyllum
Jertile; in the detailed structure of the fertile lamina and the mode of attachment of
the sporangia there is also a fairly close agreement. Count Sonms-Lavusacn finds
that in his species the pendulous sporangia were inserted far to the outside on the
lower edge of the expanded summit of the sporangiophore.{ He compares their
position with that of the ovules in Zamia or Encephalartos.\| This description holds
good equally for Sphenophyllum fertile, and the course of the bundles supplying the
sporangia seems also to have been identical in the two cases. The pedicel in
B. Rimeri is described as having enlarged epidermal cells limited to its outer side,
just as in our fossil,** while the large-celled external epidermis of the lamina (Schuppe)
is similar to, though more strongly developed than in the lateral enlargements of the
wall which occur near the base of the sporangium,tt a description which might have
