From
these sources it is apparent that the sorus consists of two rows of confluent sporangia,
the loculi of which are separated from one another by complete septa, while they
dehisce by distinct pores upon the outer, free surface. Each sorus is inserted above
a single nerve, and between the sori, plates of tissue arise from the surface of the leat’;
