However, in some special
cases, the three-dimensional imaging problem can be reduced to a two-dimensional imaging
problem. A good example for this is vertical nuclear spent fuel casks. Owing to the fact that spent fuel
assemblies are very long, spent fuel casks have the same profile at different positions along the
vertical direction if we ignore the lid and bottom parts. Therefore, for any muon path, if we shift
it in the vertical direction to a new position, then the materials encountered along the new path
will be the same as along the original path, therefore the bin size in the vertical direction can be as
large as the cask itself. Furthermore, we noticed that for muons with the same azimuthal angle,
x- and y-coordinates, but different zenith angles and z-coordinates, their expected water
