Within the hotspot, activation beats desensiti-
zation. However, further away from the site of vesicle release,
desensitization beats activation, and there are therefore few
channel openings. Distant channel openings do, however,
occur if desensitization is blocked, a fact that will become
important in the discussion of the structure/function of
the synapse in ยง4. The existence of a hotspot of channel activation during
mEPSP generation has major implications for understanding
the synaptic response and the concept of synaptic strength. Notably, because the quantal current is generated only
within a small subregion of the synapse, the size of the quant-
al response will not be substantially affected by growth of the
synapse.
