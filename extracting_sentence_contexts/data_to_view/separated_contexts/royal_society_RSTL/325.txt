Fixed air having been shewn, by Mr. Bew-
LEY, and by BERGMAN, to be an acid, of course its composition
was considered, in the new system of chemistry, to be similar
to that of all other acids. On examining facts already well
ascertained, and by various experiments discovering others, no
clear instance could be perceived of the formation of fixed air,
but in those cases where charcoal was applied red hot to respir-
able air. Mr. LAavoisIER at last established this interesting fact,
by a conclusive experiment, published in a volume of the Me-
moirs of the Academy of Sciences in 1781, and in his Traite
Elementaire in 1789, by which he demonstrated that charcoal of
wood, except a minute portion of residue, as might reasonably
be expected, combined with respirable air, and composed fixed
air only.
