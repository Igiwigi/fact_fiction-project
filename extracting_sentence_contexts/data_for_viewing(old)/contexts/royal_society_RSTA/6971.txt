that the iterative process converges; this usually presents no difficulty. Secondly, it must be
possible to calculate the errors of an approximate solution; this is the crux of the matter.
Is it possible, given a differential equation like (I.2), with boundary conditions like
(I.4) or (1.5), to compute accurate values of their left-hand sides, at mesh points and at
a representative number of boundary points, for a function given numerically at the mesh
points, including possibly some fictitious external points? With regard to the differential
equation there is clearly no worry, but the boundary condition presents great technical
difficulties.

The difficulty can be seen with reference to figure 7, in which it is required to establish
finite-difference equations at points adjacent to the curved boundary, and to satisfy a boun-
dary condition involving a normal derivative. The differential equation at the point 0
involves the fictitious points 1 and 2, and expressions for the values at these points must
therefore be obtained in terms of internal points and the given boundary conditions. There
are two obvious possibilities, neither of which is completely satisfactory.

First, normals can be drawn from the fictitious points (Fox 1944) and the boundary con-
dition satisfied at the points where these normals cut the boundary. In figure 7, for example,
the normal from 1 cuts the boundary at B, and internal mesh lines at points marked with
a cross. Formulae can therefore be established for the value at 1 in terms of the normal
derivative at B (and the functional value at B if required), and values at the crossed points.
The latter can then be obtained, by interpolation along mesh lines, in terms of interior
values.
