The shape of the
lower surface of the crust necessary to produce the field of Bouguer anomalies has been
calculated by multiplying the figures given in table 12 for a depth of 36 km. by the factor

S Ficure 9. Calculated mass distribution, Atlantic section. Lower surface of crust 1, on Airy’s hypothesis ; 2, calculated.

1:18 toallow for the fact that the topography has been assumed compensated outside zone O. These figures represent the mass-distribution condensed on a plane at this depth and it
can be seen that the centre of gravity of the compensation for the Airy hypothesis with
T = 40 km. is not far from 36 km. In both cases the density of the crust has been taken
as 2:67 and that of the substratum as 3-27.
