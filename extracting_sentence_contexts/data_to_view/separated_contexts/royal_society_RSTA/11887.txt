So long as the thermal balance is maintained with the same potential difference,
the rate of evaporation must be the same, whatever method is adopted. I cannot
see that the external work to be done is likely to alter because the space above the
water is de-saturated by passing a gas instead of removing the saturated vapour by
an exhaust, and this view is borne out by the close agreement between the means of
those groups and my later experiments. There is one curious fact which may possibly throw some light on the matter. I
performed two experiments (August 22 and September 13), passing nitrogen instead
of air. Of course I had at that time no means of judging of the comparative value of
the different experiments, and therefore was ignorant of the close approximation of
the nitrogen values and my final ones.
