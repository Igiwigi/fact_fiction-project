Cxcr7-expressing cells sequester a higher amount of SDF1a (see the dark grey rectangle) than Cxcr4-expressing agents
[11,13,16]. (c) Typical pattern of FGF10 during primordium migration. It is secreted by PM individuals at the caudal edge of the primordium and by aPM cells at the
centre of proto-neuromasts (see the coloured regions), while all other individuals express the receptor fgfr7 [5,11,16]. (Online version in colour.)

PM — aPM transitions are triggered by unknown stimuli, and affinity to their ligand, results in a self-generated local gradient of
that the formation and maturation of proto-neuromasts regulate SDFla underlying the placode. A cyclical behaviour is finally
the location of both FGF10 sources and the region of expression exhibited by the placode cluster: the assembly of a new rosette
of Cxcr4/Cxcr7 within the primordium, see figure 2b,c. towards its caudal edge is in fact accompanied by the deposition

The embryonic development of the zebrafish PLL is mainly of the most rostral one. This process is active until 46 hpf,
regulated by two diffusive chemicals. SDFla, produced by the ie. when the primordium reaches the tip of embryo’s tail and
cells constituting the myoseptum substrate, forms around 20 stops, and eventually results in the deposition of 6-8 proto-
