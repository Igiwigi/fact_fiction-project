The
percentage of specimens with window feeding damage fol-
lowed a different temporal trend: the increased probability
of grazed membranes did not begin until the end of the twen-
tieth century, and increased from 3% (2—6%) in 1990 to 45%
(14-81%) in 2015 (figure 3d). Finally, although a general
trend towards an increased number of grazed specimens
was observed over time, the number of affected leaves per
specimen increased only slightly for each type of damage
(electronic supplementary material, figure S1).

(c) Contemporary damage evaluation
The percentage of damaged purple loosestrife specimens in
2016 on the north shore of Lake Saint-Pierre was much higher

than that determined from the herbarium specimens. In fact,
97% of the collected plants had hole feeding damage, 91%
had margin feeding damage and 51% had window feeding
damage. The percentage of specimens with perforation and
margin feeding damage varied between sectors, but was
always high (75-100% of specimens damaged). Differences
were observed between the sectors for window feeding
damage: the percentage of affected plants ranged from 17 to
93% (Yamachiche: 17%; Maskinongé: 37%; Pointe-du-lac:
40%; Louiseville: 70%; Porte de la Mauricie: 93%).
