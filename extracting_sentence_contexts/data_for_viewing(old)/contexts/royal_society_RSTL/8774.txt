down over dry land. Over the sea, however, such an appearance has not been recorded;
and although I have often looked for it, I have been entirely unable to detect it. And
in the second place, even supposing the air to be in a heterogeneous state at any given
instant, such a state could not be maintained many minutes ; for different gases, or
different portions of the same gas at different temperatures, mix and diffuse very rapidly.
It is true that the heterogeneity might be maintained by upward streams of heated air
or yapour, and this is doubtless the cause of the heterogeneity of air over dry hot
ground ; but this heterogeneity, although very apparent near the ground, is never
observed at any considerable height, Upward streams of heated air must tend to mix
and diffuse rapidly, and the air as it rises is cooled by expansion until it must 800n
cease to be lighter than the surrounding air. That, as a rule, there are no streams of
heated air ascending to any considerable height over land, is definitely proved by the
fact that the light smoke from burning weeds never, or very seldom, attains an eleva-
tion of any thing like 100 feet. TI have often been struck with the way in which such
smoke will creep along the ground for the distance of half a mile, and even then not
extend to an eleyation of more than 20 or 50 feet. Over the sea the cause of such
streamlets must be much less potent than over land, and their existence still more
unlikely,
