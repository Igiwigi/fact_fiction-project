However, there is evidence that such cracks exist after all. The first indications came from : 2
measurements of earthquakes [4]. These suggested computer simulations [5,6], and laboratory : =
experiments [7] for cracks that move by sliding faces past each other, showing that cracks in {5
shear (mode II) can move faster than the transverse wave speed c; (and hence the Rayleigh wave : >
speed as well) and reach speeds close to the longitudinal speed c. Dynamic fracture theory was 1S
extended to include these ‘intersonic’ cracks [2,8,9]. [=

Cracks in rubber under tension were found to have a wedge-like tip suggestive of supersonic : Ss
motion [10]. Additional experimental work confirmed that the cracks do travel faster than the : &

cracks in tension [13,14]. Both explicit numerical solutions for atomic equations of motion and : 8

the corresponding analytical solutions show the supersonic cracks do in fact exist [15]. This last
reference contains an extended discussion of how crack speed depends upon loading for the
models studied in this manuscript.

Supersonic cracks were also observed for cracks with hyperelastic constitutive laws that cause
stiffening near the tip [16]. As shown, for example, in the current article supersonic cracks exist
equally well in materials without hyperelastic constitutive laws. Thus, we are not sure that
hyperelasticity is actually needed to promote supersonic cracks.

Furthermore, the original objection from continuum theory about the impossibility of
supersonic cracks has not directly been addressed. Doing so is a goal in this article. What we
will explain in detail is the specific way that the continuum argument breaks down. In particular,
we will show that, as a crack approaches the Rayleigh wave speed, the stress intensity factor Ky,
