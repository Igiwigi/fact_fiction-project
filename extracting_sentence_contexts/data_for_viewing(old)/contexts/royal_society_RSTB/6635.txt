overlaps the outer end of the anterior margin of the Flossentragerplatte. This region is
best shown in Brorit 19304, pl. II, fig. 2, right side; pl. III, fig. 1, left side; and P. 501,

The ventral surface of this dermal armour is almost entirely made by the great
Flossentrager, which may be called interlaterals. They meet in the middle line, and
probably possessed a dorsally directed back-turned projection which articulated with
that sheet of the anterior lateral lying below and behind the gill chamber. The lateral
margin is free, but is connected with the lower end of the lateral part of the anterior
lateral by an area of skin containing a few large stellate tubercles. This ends abruptly
at an embayed edge, best shown in Brom! (19304, pl. III, fig. 1), apparently marking
a depression for the anterior corner of the pectoral fin, which is shown (P. 501) by the
fact that it can be displaced to have been free. It is evident that a space separated the
ventral border of the anterior lateral from the hinder part of the lateral border of
the interlateral, and allowed the fin skeleton and musculature to pass from the
primary shoulder girdle (of which no trace is preserved) to the fin itself. Comparison
of this description, and fig. 25 illustrating it, with the shoulder girdle of a Ptyctodont
will show that in principle and indeed in many details the two agree.

It follows automatically from this conclusion that Gemiindina was an operculate
fish, and that the operculum is the large lateral area of the head, containing the
plates L? and L’ of Brom. The structure of the neural cranium, so far as it is known
in Asterosteus and Jagorina, is consistent with this view. It is impossible to determine

“how far ventrally the slit behind the operculum extended; it seems however most
