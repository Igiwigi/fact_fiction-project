The details of the disagreement in
variability between the 41N and 45N datasets warrants further research. Finally, we note that no direct link has been found between AMOC strength in the subpolar
North Atlantic (as measured by OSNAP) and LSW formation [30]. This is in part due to
the fact that LSW spreads throughout the subpolar region after its formation, including into
the eastern subpolar North Atlantic [52]. Hence the geometry is fundamentally different than
to the south, where the largest amount of LSW is always found on the western boundary. Furthermore, subpolar overturning is sensitive to the definition of the maximum of the
overturning streamfunction as discussed in ยง2.
