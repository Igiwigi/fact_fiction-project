The root or subterranean stock of this robust perennial is tap-shaped, stout,
fleshy, whitish, descending deeply into the sub-s0il, its main branches are slender,
horizontal, with numerous nodules, the lower branches descending, destitute, or nearly
80, of nodules. The above-ground stem forms tufts of wiry decumbent or erect
branches, bearing leaves of the same general shape as those of the clovers, but
smaller. It flowers, as a rule, too late to perfect its seed before mowing. Tt is very
hardy, bears drought well, is not very particular as to soil, but is stated to be variable
on different soils, &. At Rothamsted the variety which occurs is that called
vulgaris in HookER's © Student's Flora,” and it is pretty constant in its characteristics.

The conditions propitious to ib are : its powerful root-stock, with extensive storage
of nutritive matter, deep range, and power of availing itself of the food and moisture
in the lower layers of the oil ; the fact that the seeds are rarely produced before the
first cutting, thus obviating exhaustion, and tending to prolong the life of the indi-
vidual; its hardy constibution, as shown by its wide geographical distribution, its
relative indifference to the nature of the soil, climate, &c.
