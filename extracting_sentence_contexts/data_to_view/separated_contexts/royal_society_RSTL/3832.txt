I was at that time engaged in the construction of an extensive series of the
water battery; but, from the difficulties of insulation, which continually presented
themselves, considerable time elapsed before the battery was in a condition to afford
results, on which any dependence could be placed. Having, at length, to a certain
extent, Surmounted these difficulties, I have been enabled especially to study the
character and action of the water battery, and through it, I may hope, of the voltaic
battery generally. The results of my experiments, with a description of the apparatus
used, may, I think, not be uninteresting to the electrician, particularly as they esta-
blish the fact, beyond any doubt, of not only the passing of a distinct spark before
the completion of the circuit, but the practicability of continuing this action for
Several weeks in constant succession, and enabling us to examine, with much accuracy,
the rationale of the action of this extraordinary apparatus.

5. The water battery, which I have constructed, and which I am about to describe,
consists of 3520 pairs, or series of copper and zinc cylinders, each pair being placed
in a separate glass vessel, well covered with a coating of lac varnish. The glass cells
are placed on slips of glass, covered on both sides with a thick coating of lac ; this
coating being fixed by heating the glass over a gas furnace, and then covering it with
the varnish.
