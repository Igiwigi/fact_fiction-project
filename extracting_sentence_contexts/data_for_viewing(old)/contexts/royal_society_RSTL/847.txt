15t, That gold has an affinity for mercury, for antimony,
and for arsenic.

2d. That platina has an affinity for silver, for mercury, and
for antimony ; and that it is influenced by the presence of arsenic.

3d. That silver has an affinity for mercury.

4th. That mercury has an affinity for copper, for lead, and
for arsenic.

This $eries ofexperimentsis notintendedas asystem of metallic
affinities ; but as a few facts stated to corroborate an assertion.
I am well aware that many others might be noticed; but it is
not my intention to enter further into this subject, in the present
Paper. The general importance of the principle, and the ex-
tensive influence it is likely to have upon chemistry, demand
that it should be treated by multiplied researches, The experi-
ments that can elucidate it are of the most delicate nature, and
require peculiar care; for they do not always succeed, unless

performed under the most favourable circumstances.
