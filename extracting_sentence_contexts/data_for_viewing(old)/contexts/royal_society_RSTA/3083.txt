is in gravitational waves, and it couples so weakly to our detectors that we have had to build
the most sensitive distance-measuring apparatus ever constructed in order to measure this rather
large energy flux. The abstract tells us what sensitivity LIGO needed: ‘a peak gravitational-wave

strain of 1.0 x 10~7!’. The gravitational-wave strain is defined as twice the relative stretching of : 3
the LIGO arms as the gravitational wave passed through. This means that, as the wave reached : 8
its peak amplitude, LIGO’s 4 km arms were oscillating by about 0.1% of the radius of a proton! Dos

It is worth noting how remarkable it is that we can know that the distance is 410 Mpc, even with [=
30% uncertainty, for an event that has no observed electromagnetic counterpart. This is because : S
such an event is a standard siren, whose gravitational waveform contains enough information 2
about its intrinsic luminosity to enable us to infer distance from its measured apparent brightness aed
[16]. The relatively large uncertainty in our distance measurement comes from the fact that we : _
observed this event with only two detectors and cannot therefore place it accurately on the sky, [4
nor accurately measure its polarization, both of which we need to compare accurately its apparent : *
brightness with the intrinsic luminosity read from the waveform. Observations with a network : =
of at least three detectors are required for an accurate distance measurement, and that became : RS

possible when Advanced Virgo joined the network on 1 August 2017. We will discuss that further
in the next section.

The last part of the abstract that I will highlight here is the sentence on significance: ‘The signal
was observed with a matched-filter signal-to-noise ratio of 24 and a false alarm rate estimated
to be less than 1 event per 203000 years, equivalent to a significance greater than 5.10.’ There
are two different measures of significance quoted here, and they have quite different statistical
