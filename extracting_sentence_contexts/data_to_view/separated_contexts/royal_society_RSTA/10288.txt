It apparently contains five members: but the
& fifth equation is a linear combination of the first four, and therefore the system really
@ consists of four equations. It involves six variables, viz., a, b, c, f, g, ; and therefore
= it possesses two independent solutions. One of these is L?; the other is easily seen
g to be be — f?, = A.

3 Returning now to the system of nine equations, and bearing in mind the fact that
3 the first eight possess two solutions, one being L? and the other being a contravariant
Es of the ternary quadratic which has A for its leading coefficient, we have the
© contravariant in the well-known form

0 = (A, B, C, F, G, HXdi00, dor Po01) =

¢ The ninth equation is satisfied for any solution which is homogeneous in a, b, ¢, f, g, h

: Hence the value of p for @ is 2

e There is thus a single absolute differential invariant of the type specified; its
value is
