Every nerve from a ganglionic enlargement of the cord is thus composed of four
sets of fibres, an upper and an under one, which communicate with the cephalic gan-
glia; a transverse or commissural, that communicate only with corresponding nerves
on the opposite side of the body ; and a lateral set that communicate only with nerves
from a ganglionic enlargement on the same side of the body, and form part of the
cord in the interspace between the roots of the nerves. It is by the snccessive
addition of these lateral portions of the cord that its size is maintained almost uni-
formly throughout its whole length in the elongated bodies of the Myriapoda, On
examining the cord very closely, I have reason to believe that the upper and inferior
sets of longitudinal fibres, the ganglionic and the aganglionic, are 80mewhat smaller
at their posterior than at, their anterior extremity, a circumstance readily understood
in the fact that successive series of filaments are given off from them at each distribu-
tion of nerves from the ganglionic enlargements, while the relative size of the lateral
portions of the cord appears to be greater in the posterior than in the anterior. On
this account I have named these lateral fibres, febres of reinforcement of the cord.

In regard to the identification of these fibres, it may be well further to state, that
their separate existence is indicated chiefly at the postero-lateral margin of the gan-
glia, (fig. 7. f) where they are scen to form part of the nerves and cord without passing
upwards to the brain. In other parts of their course they are not distinguishable by
colour, and very rarely by any longitudinal line of separation from the fibres which
form the inferior longitudinal series, or portion of the cord, to which they are ap-

proximated ; but from which they are believed to be distinct from the fact, that they
