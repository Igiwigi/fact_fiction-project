This therefore
causes (or maintains) a minimal distance between Cxcr7
expressing cells and agents having Cxcr4, that prevents the
normal primordium locomotion observed in figures 6a-d,
6g,h and 9a-d, respectively. Too low SDFla internalization rates (e.g. a reduction of
asf to 0.01, which gives asst = 0.1) result in (i) a reduced
elongation of the fragments (or portion of fragments) consti-
tuted by PM and dPM individuals, ie. of the regions where
cells express the migratory receptor Cxcr4, (ii) an abnormal
disruption of the mature rosette (comprising pEs), and
(iii) anomalies in fragment locomotion, see figures 8 and 9. In
the case of negligible affinity of both SDFla receptors for
their ligand, the self-generated local gradient of SDFla under-
lying the placode is in fact too weak with respect to adhesive/
repulsive interactions and FGF10-related velocity components. Conversely, too high SDFla internalization rates (e.g. an
increase of a“! to 0.09, which gives a34f = 0.9) do not strongly
change the evolution of the numerical simulations in figures 6
and 7. We can only note that the regions constituted by Cxcr4-
expressing cells result more stretched as in the case of too high
cell sensitivity to SDFla.
