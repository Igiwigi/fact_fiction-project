viz.: it should thence follow that there is a linear relation between any four of the six
S 8quared functions 11, 7, 6, 2, 1, 9: and it is accordingly seen that this is 80. It
S further appears that in the several linear relations, the coefficients (obtained in the
= firs instance as functions of a, B, y, 6) are in fact the 10 constants c : the 15 relations
connecting the several systems of four out of the six squared functions are given in
© the table. -
