In the butterfly metabolism is reduced to a minimum, and there is every reason to
suppose that the pigmentation of the wing is practically unaffected during the life of
the imago. The uric acid and the substances allied to it, which are found on the
wings of a Pierid must be formed during the rapid tissue changes which occur in the

velopment. Thus the blow-fly when it first emerges from the pupa-case excretes
mass of nearly pure uric acid. Pouiton has shown that among butterflies the
Vanessidx excrete uric acid under like circumstances. I have myself observed that
e yellow Pieride also void uric acid immediately after they leave the chrysalis, and
it is a point of great interest to note that this is associated with a yellow pigment,
most certainly the same as that found in the wings.* I have obtained clear
§. lepidoporphyrin reactions from the yellow material so voided. The fact is thus
= emphasized that the substances used in ornament are the true excretory products of
q ‘the animal.

_ The nature of the process whereby these products reach the wing-scales can only
| he ascertained by a careful study of pupal development. I have myself repeatedly
observed that the scales are fully developed anatomically before the pigments
‘appear in them. No murexide or lepidoporphyrin reactions can be obtained from the
{ embryo wings until the perfect insect is close upon emergence, not, I believe, much
before the time when similar excretory products have begun to accumulate in the
m. As pigments similar to those found in the matured wing-scules of many
butterflies, are also present in the hair-like scales which clothe the body, it would
seem that the existence of excretory products in the wing is not to be explained by
