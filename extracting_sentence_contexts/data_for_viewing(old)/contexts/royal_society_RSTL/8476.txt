the first of these has at the point «=0, y=0 a double point, the second a triple point ;
or there are at the point in question 6 intersections; but 4 of these are the points which
give the foregoing reduction 16—4=12 ; we have thus the point «=0, y=0, counting
twice among the twelve points. Writing in the two equations &=0, the equations
become Peiy—uy*=0, Ku'—y=0, viz. these will be satisfied if Po*—y=0, that is, the
curves pass through each of the two points (Þ=0, y==+ka), and these values satisfy
(as in fact they should) the third equation,

P(2uy +208 +B)a(a+2B)—yv(y+2B)(2:y+2B+B)=0;

it is moreover easily shown that the three curves have at each of the points in question
a common tangent; viz. taking A, B, C as current coordinates, the tangent at the point
(a, Þ, y) of the second curye has for its equation

A(2% +83%8)Þ*+B(I'a*—y)—C2y/+39yþ)=0;
and for Þ=0, y=+ke this becomes 2FA +B(E&F1)F 2C=0, viz. this is the line from
the point (Þ=0, y=+s) to the point (1, —2, 1). And similarly for the other two
curves we find the same equation for the tangent.
