The suspending wire was made the insulated terminal, so that any electrostatic
pull upon this wire could only produce a force acting through the centre of support,
and thus the rotational effect would be eliminated, leaving only a translatory pull,
which would not affect the result. There were still residual electrostatic actions,
which were traced to the point where the suspension was fixed to the condenser. At this point there was necessarily a break in the metallic protecting coating fixed
to the condenser, owing to the fact that the earthed terminal could not be brought
very close to the insulated terminal without breaking down the insulation. To
eliminate this effect, the protecting coating was prolonged up round the support in
the form of a cylinder, about 3 centims. wide, and 6 centims.
