hardened to the belief that relative preponderance of the right or left ventricle may
be recognised in human electrocardiograms. Recently, the evidences for this view

have been summed up and amplified.* Relative preponderance of the left ventricle is
represented by an increase in the amplitude of R in Lead J and of S in Lead J//;
while relative preponderance of the right ventricle is represented by an increase in the
amplitude of Sin Lead J and Rin Lead I//. These are the prominent signs. It is
not with this fact but with its explanation that we are concerned at present.

It would seem clear that if a single ventricle becomes enlarged in all its dimensions,
the general distribution of the excitation wave throughout it will remain unaltered.
But as the mass of tissue involved in the process of excitation is increased, the electric
forces liberated will suffer corresponding exaggeration. There appears to be no reason
why hypertrophy of the left ventricle should materially modify the general shape of
the levogram, but there is reason to anticipate that such a change will magnify
the amplitudes of the several deflections. It is to be expected, « prior?, that the
curves from subjects who present preponderance of the left ventricle will exhibit a
preponderance of the levogram; the levogram, as we have seen, is mainly
résponsible for R in Lead / and for S in Lead ///, An exaggerated F in Lead J,
an exaggerated Sin Lead JI/, are to be predicted—they are actually discovered—
