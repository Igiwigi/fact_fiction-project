It
can change the reaction mechanism and can direct the
m.tromp@uva.nl reaction to form desired products specifically. Our daily
life as it is now, with the products and materials we
use, would not exist without catalysis. In fact, over
90-95% of all commercial chemical processes use one or
more catalysts. Perhaps the most well-known catalyst
example is the catalyst in our car: it converts toxic
exhaust gases from the engine into more environmentally
friendly gases. Large industrial processes for bulk
chemicals use heterogeneous catalysts to, for example,
synthesize nitric and sulfuric acids.
