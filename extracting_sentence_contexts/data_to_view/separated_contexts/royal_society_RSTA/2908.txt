This ansatz respects the
scaling invariance a; (t) > Ran(|R|P~7#) of (1.4). For A=1, (2.10) defines exact solutions of (1.4) corresponding to periodic travelling waves
[32]. This is due to the fact that |(dn41 — ¢n)/V2|=1, so

(\a:-%) (Ja) =a) (Ya) =8

We now estimate the residual error obtained from (1.4) and (2.10) in the case of a general
envelope function A (assumed sufficiently smooth). For this purpose, we first evaluate Apa*PP. The expansions performed below are valid when A(é,t) 40 is fixed and p > 2+.
