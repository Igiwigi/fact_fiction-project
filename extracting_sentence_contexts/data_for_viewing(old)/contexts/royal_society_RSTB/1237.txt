while a third less continuous line is seen to run for a short distance in a y
between them (fig. 133). Thus we see that in different specimens of Lepidod,
these processes are of variable form, being peg-like upgrowths, or trabec

The resemblance of these plates to partial septa cannot be overlooked, ar
inconstancy of character is a fact which will have its bearing on our general a g

The question whether these processes are to be looked upon as sub-archespg
origin, or as the result of a partial sterilization of the archesporium itself, mus
also remain uncertain, in default of developmental data, which are necess;
deciding such a question. I think, however, that comparisons, on the one han

sporangia of Lepidodendron, also, the brown lines represent sterile tissue, whi
the course of development of the spores has become disorganized, and the
shrivelled out of shape.
