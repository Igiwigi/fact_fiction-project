In particular, the : 4
MDPs that are used by MPC at each decision epoch do not explicitly model, within the MDP, De
the fact that the decision-maker will have available a new set of forecasts at each future decision : 3
epoch within the decision horizon associated with the MDP. This is also the case in adaptations : 3
of standard MPC to the setting where the forecasts contain probabilistic information [16]. By 8

contrast, the MDPs introduced by this paper model the fact that the forecasts are continually
‘refreshed’ over the MDP’s decision horizon, and do so via a formulation that preserves the
computational tractability of the MDP. In §7, we introduce a simple energy system control model that controls interior building
temperatures in an external weather environment for which forecasts are available. In the
presence of a quadratic cost structure, we are able to use the existing linear-quadratic stochastic
control theory to compute the optimal value associated with MDPs for the energy system in which
no forecast information is available and also the optimal value for the dynamic forecasting MDP
of §5.
