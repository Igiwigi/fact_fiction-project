undertaken mainly with a view to the investigation of thunderstorms, it seemed
desirable that the sensitiveness should be so arranged that the deflection should
never be greater in two minutes than would bring the boom of the electrometer to
the edge of the paper on which the record was being made. This necessitated a
somewhat low sensitiveness, and, as a consequence, the electricity of rain with very
low charges could not be measured. There was the possibility of altering the
sensitiveness of the instrument according to the kind of rain which was expected,
but this was considered impracticable in view of the fact that the instrument could
not be watched continually, but had to be left to itself to take the records entirely
automatically. In reality, this difficulty was not serious. The conditions during
thunderstorms are entirely different from those during gentle rain, aud to investigate
the two cases is really a matter of two distinct researches. The present research
was concerned with highly charged rain, and so the fact that the instrument did not
also record very small charges was not of any great consequence,

By good fortune, after the first one or two storms, a degree of sensitiveness was’
found which proved to be satisfactory during the rest of the rains. On only two
or three occasions did the boom pass to the edge of the paper, and on each of these
occasions the instrument was under observation, so that a rough estimate could be
made as to what would have been the extent of the deflection from the time taken
for the boom to reach the stop. This sensitiveness gave a deflection of 1 cm. for
40 volts, and, as a deflection of 0°2 mm. could be recognised with certainty, a
potential of 1 volt could be measured. The capacity of the receiving system was
determined to be 141 cm., and hence the smallest charge which could be measured
with certainty was 0°47 electrostatic unit. The rain entered the receiver through
