We thus find on
careful examination not only continuity between the results obtained before and after
stretching, but an essential similarity.
| At the same time, experiments both with this and with other specimens of iron
have shown that, when loaded and unloaded until the action becomes eyclie, a piece
which has not been strained beyond its elastic limit since annealing behaves after the
type of curve No. 1 below, and one which has received permanent seb behaves after
the type of No. 2.

This difference of behaviour appears, in fact, to form a criterion by which we!
without fail distinguish a strained from an annealed piece. No. 1. No. 2.
