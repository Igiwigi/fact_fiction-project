That this is so in some cases does not at all exclude the
Sprobability that sporangia are also developed from tissue, the origin of which has
‘shad no connection with the site of an archegonium. E Some of the archegonia present no differences from those found in an unopened
state elsewhere. But the cells around the ovum in others have, by division, given
Hise to a small-celled tissue, which closely resembles that found beneath sporangia,
fund may, in fact, be continuous with it. This may occur in connection with arche-
“@ronia, the central series of cells of which has not become discoloured. Further, in
ome of the sporangium-bearing projections, the arrangement and appearance of the
Seells suggest that the projection is a modification of such an archegonium (fig. 22).
