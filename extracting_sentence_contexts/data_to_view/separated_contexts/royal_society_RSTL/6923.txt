Then, since the in-
S terchange of any two of the yariables u, v, w must leave (2) unaltered, (Q) will be unaltered by the interchange
A of any two of tho letters r, s, t, and is consequently a symmetric function of p, o, 7, the roots of the equation

Hence since Q cannot become infinite when L=0, which merely implies that the general form reduces to
(a, 0, 0, 0, e, iLe, yu),

Q=d(J, K, T), a rational integral function of J, K, L.
2. If the degree Q is of the form 4m+2, (Q) will be a function of 7, 8, ?, which changes its sign when u and v

and consequently, if we call T the resultant in respect to , y, we have
+1 =p"go(o—g)(r—0)(g—r"),
and
P=pgtriri(o—g)(r—o)(pmr}
=p*(o—g)(r—oY(g—ry Te.

(43) Thus we ee that the two quantities G, T*, which are both rational integral
functions of the degree 36 in the coefficients of F(w, y), cannot one vanish without the
other, at all events when L is not equal to zero. This is sufficient to show that they are
identical to a numerical factor pres, whatever L may be, zero or not zero(®), and con-
sequently that the quantity called G, proved to be positive upon the supposition of L
not being zero, must also remain positive when L is zero, because it is in fact the square
of a rational function of the coefficients. But we may also prove this independently
by virtue of the supplementary reduced form au*+5eur'+fv* applicable to the cage of
L zero. For when L=0, G becomes JK*; s0 that the condition © G not negative” implies
8wply that J is positive unless K vanishes.
