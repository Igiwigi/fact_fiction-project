In between these extremes are systems such as
copper-tin and silver-gallium, where the size factors are near the critical limit,
and the whole position becomes more confused. The fact that in these and
other systems the experimental work leads to the conception of liquidus and solidus
factors which are whole numbers suggests clearly that there is some kind of electronic
quantum equilibrium. It is this fact which makes us consider a purely ionic explanation
to be improbable. An assumption that the depression of the freezing point was pro-
portional to the repulsion between an ion of the solvent and one of the solute, and the
depression of the melting point proportional to the repulsion between two solute ions
would account for the relations in the periods, but would give no reason for the whole
number factors in other relations. An electronic explanation, on the other hand, does
not suffer from this disadvantage, since the electrons in different atoms are in different
energy states.
