mechanics becomes evident when reading the first few paragraphs of the paper. Taylor begins
by noting that in experiments of the flow of fluids past solid boundaries, ‘steady motion breaks
down and eddying flow sets in’ [2, p. 289], and that ‘A great many attempts have been made
to discover some mathematical representation of fluid instability, but so far they have been
unsuccessful in every case’ [2, p. 289]. Taylor goes on to enumerate attempts by giants in the
field of fluid mechanics including Kelvin, Rayleigh, Sommerfeld, Orr, Mises and Hopf to examine
flow between two infinite parallel plates, but who all concluded that ‘the fundamental small
disturbances of this system are stable’ [2, p. 289]. Taylor also discusses [2, p. 290] Osborne
Reynolds’ (1895) [3] and William Orr’s (1907) [4] ‘promising’ but unsuccessful attempts to
consider the stability related to Reynolds’ classic 1883 experimental results [5] for the transition
to turbulent flow in a pipe.

Clearly, Taylor saw this as a challenge. In fact, he quotes Orr’s remarks that ‘It would
seem improbable that any sharp criterion for stability of fluid motion will ever be arrived at
mathematically’ [4, p. 75], [2, p. 290]. Taylor proves just the opposite by intentionally considering
flow between concentric rotating cylinders rather than between two parallel planes. Taylor
made clear that he was searching for an example where a mathematical representation could be
found to match observable results, and he ended up focusing on Rayleigh’s instability criterion
[6, p. 210] ‘so that a detailed comparison can be made between the results of analysis and those
of experiment’ [2, p. 290]. The motivation was simply that ‘It is very much easier to design
apparatus for studying the flow of fluid under pressure through a tube, or the flow between
two concentric rotating cylinders’ [2, p. 291]. Taylor then opts for studying the concentric cylinder
case rather than pipe flow because he notes that in pipe flow small disturbances are stable while
large disturbances, which are much more difficult to study, are unstable [2, p. 291].
