The value of depends on the nature of the gas and on its physical condition, By
making experiments in gas of different densities, it is 8hown that w remains constant,
s0 that its value is the same for air at 0:5 inch and at 30 inches pressure, provided
the temperature remains the same. This will be seen by examining Table IV., where
the value of L, the logarithm of the decrement of arc in ten single vibrations, is the
same for the same temperature, though the density is sixty times greater in s0me cases
than in others. In fact the numbers in the column headed L' were calculated on the
hypothesis that the viscosity is independent of the density, and they agree yery well
with the observed values. It will be seen, however, that the value of L rises and falls with the temperature, as
given in the second column of Table IV. These temperatures range from 51* to 74*
Fahr., and were the natural temperatures of the room on different days in May 1865.
