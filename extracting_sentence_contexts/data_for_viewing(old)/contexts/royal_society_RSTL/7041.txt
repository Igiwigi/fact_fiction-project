On this view of the subject the difficulty otherwise experienced in conceiving floods
of a magnitude 8nch that the waters would rise to the brim of these deep valleys, or in
supposing these valleys to be filled up with silt and afterwards re-excavated, is ayoided,
for it would reduce the rise to be accounted for to limits more compatible with our
experience of certain existing rivers. It is possible also that variations in the extent of
elevation of the land may even cause the difference often to appear greater than it is.

There is one seeming difficulty to this hypothesis, which must occur to every field
geologist: it is, the apparently distinct separation of the Loess and the underlying
gravels wherever they occur in as8ociation. But a close examination will sometimes
show thin seams of loam, not to be distinguished from the Loess, intercalated in the
gravels, especially in the higher levels, though as a rule the masses of this material
invariably overlie the gravels. The explanation of this fact is, I apprehend, to be found
in the circumstance that it is only when the shingle or gravel ceased to be deposited,
owing to the changes in the leyel or course of the river, that the Loess could accumulate.
So long as the place was in the direct line and on the level of the stream, and subject
to its scouring action, no such depoxit could take place. Consequently, s0 long as the
bed of the old river was on the leyel of d, diag. fig. 17, 80 long would the accumulation
