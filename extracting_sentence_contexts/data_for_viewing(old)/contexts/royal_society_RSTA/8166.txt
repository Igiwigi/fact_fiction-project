R, which take the place of the cylindrical obstacles (fig. 2). This continues until
sufficient cork has been deposited for the light intermediate ridge to form its own

marked vortex system, when the intermediate ridge behaves much as a full ridge, as
observed. That the particles which form the intermediate ridge are, in fact, on the
whole smaller than the particles of the main ridges was proved by collecting particles
from both types of ridges when the appearance was as illustrated in fig. 7, Plate 21.
As a result of several measurements, the mean diameter of the particles of the main
ridges came out to be 0-071 mm., and of the intermediate ridges 0-054 mm.

6. The Formation of the Eyes.

As already described, the formation of eyes takes place at a frequency a little below
that which gives the antinodal dises. As in the phenomenon of ridge formation, the
energy of the vibration plays a controlling part. If this energy is large enough, then
the movement to the nodes which leads to the formation of eyes takes place even at
the precise frequency which forms antinodal discs ; these remain in position, although
