On Cord Reflex.—All experiments conducted on brainless frogs with vascular
ligature applied to one leg, go to show that reflex is, excepting in the class of case
just referred to above, but little affected on the side open to circulation of pyraconi-
tine, and that there is no evidence that reflex centres in the cord or sensory or motor
nerves at the periphery are primarily depressed in their function. The reflex
becomes slightly retarded on both sides after large but sublethal doses. In no reflex
experiment has tetanic spasm been observed, and this fact points to the medullary or
possibly cerebral origination of those movements which are seen in the uninjured

animal. Ensuing excitement of movement is not demonstrable in the brainless
frog. On the Heart.—The heart of an etherised frog exposed in situ, the vagi being also
prepared, showed the following phenomena after pyraconitine :—
