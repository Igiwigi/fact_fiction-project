In this paper he
explains how he has obtained a rigorous solution for the figure and stability of the
pear-shaped figure, and he pronounces it to be unstable. In my paper in the
‘Philosophical Transactions’* I had arrived at an opposite conclusion. The stability or instability depends, in fact, on the sign of a certain function which
M. Lrarounorr calls A, and which I denote A)+>(B,)’/C’, where A) is equal to
As ls (72) + 20] —gout (2, s]. M. Lrarounorr tells us that, after having seen my conclusion he repeated all his
computations and confirmed his former result. He attributes the disagreement
between us to the fact that I have only computed portion of an infinite series, and
only used approximate forms for the elliptic integrals in the several terms, He
believes that the inclusion of the neglected residue of the infinite series would lead to
an opposite conclusion,

In my computation the function @;[% (ox)’+2,] —yo, is decisively negative, and
being numerically greater than ¥{(B;)’/C¢+[#, s]}, which is positive, the sum of the
two is negative.
