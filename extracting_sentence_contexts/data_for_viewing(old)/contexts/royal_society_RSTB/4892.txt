these constants do not give a good fit, expectation exceeding observation for genera
of 2 and 3 species and being continuously in defect of the graduated data from genera of
4 to genera of 34 species, which was as far as I carried the work. The group is so
heterogeneous that I do not think a good fit was to be expected: but the type of misfit
is not very clearly analogous with either type of misfit shown in the two illustrations
above for z compound and ¢ compound respectively. We might reasonably, of course,
expect compoundedness as regards both elements.

Brief and inadequate as it is, this discussion is at least sufficient to indicate, I hope,
that the interpretation of the values of 9 and + arrived at in any given case or series
of cases is not a simple matter nor likely to be quite straightforward.

To all the other difficulties of interpretation is to be added the fact that errors of
sampling in + and ¢ are very high. This became evident at an early stage of the work.
since mere inspection of Table III showed that alterations of f, and M well within the
limits of fluctuations of sampling would produce relatively large changes in + and ¢.
The conclusion is fully confirmed by the following investigation.

We determine = and ¢ virtually by solving the equations

fi=¢ (e,7) M = » (, 7):
Hence 7 < j
