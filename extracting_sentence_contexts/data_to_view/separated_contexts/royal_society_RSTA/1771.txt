13. The two new potentials A, and ¢,, introduced in the analysis of the last
paragraph, are the general forms of the potentials analogous to the ordinary scalar
and vector potentials of this theory, and they satisfy similar equations. We have,
in fact,

Curl A, = E+ 40 Jc, dt

where ©, is the total current density of electric flux including the effective representa-
tion of the magnetism. Thus

Curl Curl A, = Curl E+ 47 fcunt C, dt

= 1 + 4ar [Curl C, dt.
