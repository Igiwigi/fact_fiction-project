The considerable increase in salts in IV. is, we think, due to some interference with
the circulation through the gland, for this contains a higher percentage of organic
substance than the more rapidly secreted saliva ITT.

GexeraL REMARKS ON THE EFFECT ON THE SECRETION OF SALTS AND INJECTING
Sautr Sonurion Into THE Bioop,

We have seen that, when the volume of the blood is increased to any considerable
extent by salt solution varying from ‘2 to 2 per cent., the rate of secretion for a given
stimulus is increased. This we take to be due to a larger quantity of blood passing
through the gland ; and from this, together with the fact that bleeding decreases the
rate of secretion, we conclude that, within certain limits, the amount of water secreted
for a given stimulus—with a given irritability of the gland—varies directly with the
amount of blood passing through the gland.

The increased secretion of water brought about by increased blood-flow is accom-
panied, unless, perhaps, when the blood is excessively diluted, by an increase in the
secretion of salts. The extent of the increase depends upon the percentage of salts
in the blood ; if the percentage of salts in the blood be sufficiently diminished, the
increase in the amount of salts secreted does not keep pace with the increase in the
secretion of water, and, consequently, the percentage of salts in the saliva falls. If
the percentage of salts in the blood be sufliciently increased, that of the saliva will
also be increased.
