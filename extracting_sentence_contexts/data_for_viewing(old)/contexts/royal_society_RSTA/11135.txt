MR. 8S. W. J. SMITH ON THE NATURE OF ELECTROCAPILLARY PHENOMENA. 69

presumably independent of the nature of the anion ; but it is obvious that we obtain
no information from the curves as to whether their subsequent course is free from any
non-electrostatic influence depending upon the kation. For the kation is the same
and of the same concentration in the two solutions. It is, however, easy to extend
the above observations so as to show that (granting the Nernst calculation gives at
least approximately the potential difference between unequally concentrated solutions
of the same salt), although the form of the lower portion of the descending curve
varies very little with the strength of the solution, yet the surface tension for a given
potential difference depends upon the strength of the solution. From this it
would appear that the surface tension does not depend upon the electrostatic effect
alone even when the anion effect has presumably disappeared ; but that, in fact, there
is also a kation effect which becomes evident as the solution becomes increasingly
positive with regard to the electrode.

2. Final experiments showing the agreement of the first hypothesis of the Lippmann-
Helmholtz theory with the Nernst-Planck theory of the potential difference between
KCl and KI.â€”We may, however, first apply to the ordinary electro-capillary curves for
equally concentrated solutions of KI and KCl, the result suggested by the curves
already given, that ultimately the descending branch of either curve is practically
unaffected by the nature of the anion, and that if it is then influenced by the kation,
the nature of the influence is such that, in equally concentrated solutions of salts
possessing the same kation, the potential difference for a given surface tension is the
same in both solutions. It is found that the descending branches eventually
