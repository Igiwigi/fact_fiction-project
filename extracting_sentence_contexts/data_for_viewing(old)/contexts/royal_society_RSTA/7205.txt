and inserting this in equation (102) and integrating from —0 to ¢ we obtain

SOUND PULSES BY AN INFINITELY LONG STRIP 87

The relevant points A and D in figure 1 have been restricted only by the condition that they
lie outside the disturbance due to the strip up to time ¢,. In fact, v and ; are identical outside
this region so that the integrands on the right-hand side of equation (104) are zero outside
the region of disturbance due to reflexion and diffraction at the strip.

The physical interpretation of equation (104) is that the excess rate of total flow to the
sides due to the presence of the strip is proportional to the total force (or average pressure)
on the rear of the strip.

The preceding relations have been derived generally for any time-variation in the
incident pulse. If we now consider our basic pulse defined by equation (10) and revert to
our non-dimensional units we can, by use of symmetry and equation (12), write equation

102) in the form
