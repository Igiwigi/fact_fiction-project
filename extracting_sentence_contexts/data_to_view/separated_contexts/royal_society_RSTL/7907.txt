Roughly speaking, we may say that one half a ship's weight is
taken at the bow, and the other half at the stern when the middle is unsupported ; 80
that near the points of support the shearing-force is approximately one half the ship's
weight. In preceding investigations it has been shown that for still water the shearing-
force has an approximate maximum value of 4; part of the total weight; and that for

Support on a wavye-crest the shearing-force probably does not exceed + part of the total
weight; hence the above-mentioned fact, as to the increase of shearing-strains in a ship
' _ ashore, becomes obvious. The quantitative examples which have been chosen to illustrate the maximum strains
incidental to suspension by the ends only are based upon the three typical ships pre-
viously considered, viz. the * Minotaur,” the © Bellerophon,” and the © Victoria and Albert.”
