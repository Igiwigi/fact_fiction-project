and volume of permanent gases.

BuNnsEx and SCHISCHKOFP, on the other hand, who, like ourselyes, have arrived at the
conclusion that at the moment of explosion a large part of the products is not in the

SF gaseous state, have deduced the total work which gunpowder is capable of performing,
a on the assumption that the work on the projectile is effected by the expansion of the
S permanent gases alone, without addition or subtraction of heat, and that, in fact, the
non-gaseous products play no part in the expansion.

Sufficient data were not at the command of either of the authorities we have named
© to enable them adequately to test their theories; and we propose in the first place, with
= the data at our disposal, to compare their hypotheses with actual facts, by computing
S the tensions for different volumes and comparing the calculated results both with the
