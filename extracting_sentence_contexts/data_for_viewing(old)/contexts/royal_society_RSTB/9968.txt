reproductive pace have often been interpreted as coercive
reflections of her male partner's fitness interests [11,12].
These arguments are particularly surprising given that
higher fertility and shorter IBIs are often used as indicators
of higher fitness. For example, in much of the cooperative
breeding literature higher fertility, and probabilities of pro-
gressing to a next birth, are interpreted as evidence that kin
presence is helpful—presumably because it increases fitness
[57-59]. This inconsistency means the same empirical associ-
ation of kin presence with higher fertility is often interpreted
as evidence of altruism, or of coercion, depending on whether
the family member is a woman's mother [57,59] or mother-
in-law [11,60], respectively. In fact, in most places where
anthropologists have tried to measure the relationship between
fertility and fitness, including in high fertility contexts with
limited effective contraception, these are positively and mono-
tonically related [61-64]. This does not necessarily mean that
one or both arguments must be incorrect: a woman’s costs to
shorter IBIs can be lowered by supportive social relations,
and she can be coerced into a shorter (or longer) IBI by
a mate unsure about his future paternity. However, we
should be devising better predictions for differentiating the
hypothesized mechanisms of influence on reproduction.
This problem of multiple interpretations parallels inconsisten-
cies in the development literature where both high and low
