them. If we could modulate a beam of such particles (by, for example, simply turning the beam
on and off to transmit Morse code, as Heaviside once did in his youth), then we would have
what has been called a tachyonic anti-telephone [42]. (Ordinary telephones send messages to the
future, and so a communication device that transmits to the past is an anti-telephone.) One of the
authors of the anti-telephone journal paper (the American physicist Gregory Benford) later used
this concept to write a well-received novel in which the world of 1998, on the verge of ecological


collapse, tries to warn the world of 1963 via tachyon transmissions [43]. This then brings into play
concerns about changing the past, free will and other equally bothersome issues [36].

Sending messages to the past has (and this should be no surprise) been enthusiastically
embraced by science fiction writers [44-49]. But the concept has just as enthusiastically been
rejected by no less an authority than Einstein, who emphatically denied the possibility of doing
such a thing, specifically writing ‘We cannot send wire messages into the past’ [50]. That’s pretty
blunt!

It is my opinion that Wells and Heaviside would both have agreed with Einstein. Wells would
have done so, completely and immediately, even before Einstein's relativity, with Heaviside
joining him after being confronted with the logical paradoxes. Heaviside certainly would not
have liked Einstein’s forbidding of FTL particles, but I think the logical paradoxes would have
been simply too much for him to accept. Heaviside was often a radical mathematician, yes, but at
his core, he was still a conservative, Victorian-age physicist.
