The fifth experiment, performed with this apparatus, at once gave a refractivity of
227, which is nearly identical with the best experiment of the 13th January.

+ A molecule of HF probably retards light less than a molecule of fluorine, but since the molecule of
this vapour, under normal conditions, is at least as complex as H,F,, its presence in an atmosphere of
fluorine would probably raise the refractivity of the mixture. ON THE REFRACTIVE INDEX OF GASEOUS FLUORINE. 321

In all these trials a singular fact was observed. The index slowly decreased to a
minimum, and, after remaining steady for a few minutes, retrograded by several
points, indicating the presence of an increased proportion of some gas of higher
refractivity. This effect was observed in nearly every subsequent experiment
performed with the prism, and its significance will be referred to hereafter.
