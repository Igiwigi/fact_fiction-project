§ The word “verwachsene” in the text must, I think, be a mistake for “ unverwachsene,” for Sac-
copteris, to which it is applied, has non-coalescent, separate sporangia.

coalescence of sporangia to form synangia, and read the paleeophytological record as
establishing this opinion. I do not think that this conclusion is sufficiently justified
by the facts. We may put aside Senftenbergia on the double ground that its affinity
with the Marattiaceze is uncertain, and that, its sporangia being isolated, and not
associated into sori, it cannot be used in argument as to the progressive changes
within the sorus itself at that early period. The argument of Stur as to the later
appearance of coalescence of sporangia within the sorus, turns then upon the case of
Succopteris; but even Stur himself does not go further than saying that this plant
is believed to have existed in the Culm (“im Culm zu vermuthen ist”): it is present,
certainly, he states, in the lower Coal Measures; but he admits that Danqites is
also present in the lower Coal Measures, and that is a type in which the synangial
condition is seen in its most pronounced form. So that, as far as there is really secure
evidence from forms admitted to be Marattiaceous, it would seem that the geological
record shows a simultaneous appearance of the two types in the lower Coal Measures,
and therefore will not serve to decide the priority either of those with sporangia
