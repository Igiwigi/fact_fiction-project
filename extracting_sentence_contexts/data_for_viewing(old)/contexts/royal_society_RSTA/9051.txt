130 PROF. L. N. G. FILON ON THE SECOND APPROXIMATION TO

In virtue of the fact that 0 is of order r~! (since the negative exponential factor is
throughout present) the first of these leads to an integral vanishing unconditionally. The
second does likewise, writing sin 0 = 4/V/«r, d0 = dy//xr, and so does the third. Thus
N,. vanishes unconditionally.

Accordingly, the whole of the terms of the second degree really contribute (having regard
to the results of § 20) nothing to the torque on the cylinder.

There remains the term N, of the first degree. This is given by
