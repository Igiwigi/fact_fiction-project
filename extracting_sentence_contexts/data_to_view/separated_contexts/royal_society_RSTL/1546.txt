DeL1Le, by which J find that he had employed artificial respiration
for the purpose of recoyering animals, which were under the influence of this poison,
with success, M. DeLrLe describes the Upas Tieute as causing death, by occa«
Sioning repeated and long continued contractions of the muscles of respiration, on
which it acts through the medium of the spinal marrow, without destroying the func»

the brain, it may, in some instances, at least, be made to-re-
cover, if respiration is artificially produced, and continued for
a certain length of time. From analogy we might draw some conclusions respecting
the mode in which some other vegetable poisons produce
their effects on the animal s8ystem ; but I forbear to enter into
any speculative inquiries ; as it is my wish, in the present com-
munication, to record such facts only, as appear to be estab-
liched by actual experiment. Addition to the Croonian Lecture for the Year 1810,

In the experiments formerly detailed, where the circulation
was maintained by means of artificial respiration after the head
was removed, I observed that the blood, in its passage through
the lungs, was altered from a dark to a scarlet colour, and
hence I was led to conclude that the action of the air produced
in it changes analogous to those, which occur under ordinary
circumstances, I have lately, with the assistance of my friend
