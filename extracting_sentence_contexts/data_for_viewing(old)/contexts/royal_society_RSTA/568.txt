represented in this region. The intensity of the coupling between the land surface and the
atmosphere is another important factor in West Africa where PMIP simulations show very


different intensities of evaporation depending on the convection and precipitation regimes [49].
Finally, model biases and the representation of the ITCZ are factors that precondition the surface
humidity and vegetation growth. The MH precipitation differences with modern conditions are
located to the north of the present-day ITCZ [50]. Model biases in the modern location of the ITCZ
are therefore also a factor that partly impacts the MH vegetation feedback.

4. Model biases and vegetation feedback in Africa

The fact that land-surface albedo feedbacks are affected by model biases in the PI simulations
makes it difficult to fully disentangle the part of the results that is purely because of model
dynamical and physical representations of climate from the part that results from model tuning,
initial state and implementation of the experimental protocol. To further illustrate this point

we consider MH simulations run with two different versions of the IPSL climate model [33]: : =
IPSL_CM5A_LR and IPSL_CM5B_LR. These two versions share the same ocean, sea-ice and land- : yy
surface models. The differences between them only arise from atmospheric physics and tuning (3
[51]. Both versions use the same atmospheric deep convection scheme, but the IPSL_CM5B_LR : S
version of the atmospheric component (LMDZ5B) includes a mass flux representation of the 22
thermal plumes or rolls of the convective boundary layer, coupled to a bi-Gaussian statistical ne]
cloud scheme, as well as a parametrization of the cold pools generated below cumulonimbus : S
by re-evaporation of convective precipitation [52]. These improvements in atmospheric physics : =
