If we wish to hold the view that the mass of an electron is wholly electric we must
conclude that the particles in Kaurmann’s experiments are not electrons, but are
either charged particles with a real constitutional mass, or electrons which have
become attached to gross matter.

The analysis, on the other hand, is distinctly against ABRAHAM’s formula and
No. 2.

We have no right to conclude that the particles are conductors, as it is still
probable that the assumption of perfect insulation would explain the experiments
(see Section 9). We may only claim that the assumption of perfect conductivity
does not disagree with the facts.

We may, however, fairly argue from the experiments that condition (2) cannot be
maintained along with the view that the particles are conductors, while condition (1)
with this hypothesis adequately explain the facts.

In forming a judgment of the results of this application of theory to iis it
may be well to recall the concluding paragraph of Section 4.

Since this analysis was made an investigation by Bucuerstr (‘ Phys. Zeit,’ 1908,
p- 755) has appeared. He gives the results of experiments agreeing well with
Lorentz’ formula m//(1—k*)'” for a “ contracted electron,” but not in agreement with
Apranan’s formula. I may say that KaurMann’s experiments also agree excellently
