It is, therefore, clear, from a study of the evidence afforded by the adult egg alone,
that the peculiar behaviour of the peripheral layer of spherules is not of the nature of
a fixation artifact, nor in any way due to the peripheral position which they occupy. It is, instead, evident that they must differ considerably in constitution from the yolk
spherules. Nor is there any evidence that a conversion of the one into the other is
taking place ; a conclusion fully in harmony with the fact that the number of the
peripheral spherules remains fairly constant, not only during the closing period of yolk
formation, but also after the completion of this process for as long as the egg remains
in the pinnule. XII. Yolk Formation.
