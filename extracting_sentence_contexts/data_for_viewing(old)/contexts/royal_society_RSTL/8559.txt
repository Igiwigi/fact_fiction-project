Similar experiments, attended with similar results, were tried with a platinum and
with a glass index; and instead of water, iodine has been put into the bulb to begin with.

It is impossible to conceive that in these experiments sufficient condensable gas or
vapour was present to produce the effects Professor O8B0RNE REYNOLDS ascribes to it.
After the repeated heating to redness at the highest attainable exhaustion, it is difficult
to imagine that sufficient vapour or gas should condense on the moyable index to be
instantly driven off by a ray of light or even the warmth of the finger with recoil enough
to drive backwards a heavy piece of metal.

123. 1t seems to me that a strong argument against Professor ReyNoLDs's theory (and
also against the electrical and air-current theories) may be drawn from the fact that the
repulsion in a vacuum is not confined to those red and ultra-red rays of the spectrum
which mainly produce dilatation of mercury in a thermometer, excite an electrical
current between antimony and bisgmuth couples, and cause a sensation of warmth when
falling on the skin, but that any ray from the ultra-red to the ultra-violet will produce
a similar effect. It cannot be reasonably argued that a ray of light, filtered through
Plates of glass and alum (109), can instantly vaporize a film of moisture or condensable
gas from a surface on which it is caused to shine, or that it can produce air-currents in
the almost perfect yacuum surrounding the surface shone upon, or that it will produce
electrical excitement on such a surface.

124. Facts tested and verified by numerous experiments, but scarcely more than
touched upon in the present paper, are, I think, gradually shaping themselyes in order,
