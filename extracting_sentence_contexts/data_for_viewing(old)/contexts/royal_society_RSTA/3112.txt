to prove the fundamental correctness of using equations like Navier-Stokes to describe the
physical behaviour of materials. Then in 2000, one hundred years after Hilbert, a group of
mathematicians examined the future of mathematics again. Many of Hilbert’s problems had in
fact been solved at least partially over the interim years. But Hilbert’s sixth remained a complete
enigma’ [2, p. 47].

The book of Rojstaczer is a novel and by definition a work of fiction and it incorrectly conflates
Hilbert’s sixth problem with the Clay Millenium problem for the Navier-Stokes equations.
Nevertheless, I find it interesting that a novelist adds some romance to a problem that at first
glance may appear rather dull. In this regard, I quote A. S. Wightman’s article [3] on the sixth
problem: ‘Since physics has gone through two revolutions in the twentieth century, one might
think that the original questions posed by Hilbert would be now primarily of archeological
interest’. :

As the articles in this volume attest, the mathematical issue of passage from the mesoscopic =
Boltzmann equations to the macroscopic Euler equations has remained a continuing theme 3
