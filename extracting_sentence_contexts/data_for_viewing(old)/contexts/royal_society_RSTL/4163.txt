1. That the voltaic arc may be produced, a pile of greater tension is required than
that which is necessary for the ordinary calorific and electro-chemical phenomena.
The necessity of this condition proves the great resistance presented to the passage
of the electric current by the minutely divided matter, whatever it may be, which
connects the two poles.

2. The luminous arc cannot exist, unless contact be previously made between the
electrodes, and unless these, or at least one of them, be terminated at the point of
contact by points fine enough to produce in them an increase of temperature, When
this increased temperature is once produced, we may, by separating the electrodes
gradually and with precaution from each other, obtain the luminous are, the length
of which will depend on the intensity of the pile. DantzLL discovered the important
fact, which was confirmed by M. Van Bzepa in a very recent investigation inserted
in the Comptes Rendus de VAcad6mie, that without contact having taken place, the
luminous arc may be produced between two electrodes placed very near together,
by causing the discharge of a Leyden jar to pass between them : this is owing to the

discbarge being always attended by the transference of highly diffused matter, which
closes the circuit during the instant of time necessary for the formation of the arc.
