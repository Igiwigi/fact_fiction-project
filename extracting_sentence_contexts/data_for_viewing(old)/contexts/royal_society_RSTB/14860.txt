Infants are equipped to both understand and produce com-
municative gestures about actual states of affairs [39]. The
above review indicates that 2- and 3-year-olds can, in
addition, encode and convey information about possible
states of affairs. Thus, not only do young children understand
how communication works via the supply of testimony about
the way things actually are, they also understand how com-
munication works via the signalling of the way that things
might be. Indeed, young children’s early sharing of

information about possibilities suggests that they are likely
to heed, engage with, and trust informants who are not
making straightforward factual assertions and continue to
do so even when those assertions are not accurate descrip-
tions of current reality (as in the context of pretend play
and fictional stories), or may prove to be false (as in the con-
text of opinions about non-immediate possibilities). In
summary, children’s early participation in communication is
not confined to the transmission of known facts. From an
early age, it also includes requests for, and the provision of,
information about possibilities—alongside the world of
known facts.

The available comparative evidence indicates that this
early-emerging human capacity is not observed in great
