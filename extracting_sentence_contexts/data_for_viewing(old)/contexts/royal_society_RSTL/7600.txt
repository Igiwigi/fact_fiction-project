Likewise, points taken at random in a line may be supposed equidistant. And if
random values be taken for any quantity, they may be supposed to form an arithmetical
series, with an infinitesimal difference.

Let us now consider the case of a straight line drawn at random in an infinite
plane: the assemblage from which we select it is, as before, an infinity of lines drawn
at random in the plane. What is the nature of this aggregate? First, since any direction
is as likely as any other, as many of the lines are parallel to any given direction as to
any other. Consider one of these systems of parallels; let them be cut by any infinite
perpendicular. As this infinite system of parallels is drawn at random, they are as
thickly disposed along any part of the perpendicular as along any other; the inter-
sections being in fact random points on the perpendicular. Hence it is easily seen that,
for all purposes of calculation, the assemblage of lines may be thus conceived. Divide
the angular space round any point into a number of equal angles 39, and for every direc-
tion let the plane be ruled with an infinity of equidistant parallel lines, the common
infinitesimal distance being the same for every set, of parallels. Or we may suppose one
such system of parallels drawn, and then turned through an angle 39, then through
another equal angle, and 80 on, till they have returned to their former direction. '

If we take any fixed axes in the plane, a random line may be represented by the
equation

a cos 6y 8in 6=p, |
where p and 6 are constants taken at random. $
