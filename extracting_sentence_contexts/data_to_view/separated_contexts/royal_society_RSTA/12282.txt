So far as electric phenomena are concerned it is quite easy to see the effect of this

100. Although this term involves a contact force it does not explain the known
facts, since, as can be easily seen, the contact force here obtained is such that
equation (1) would be invariably true. We seem then to be driven to the conclusion
that to explain contact force, /, cannot any longer be assumed to be zero. Adopting the suggestion of Professor Curystat, ‘Encye.
