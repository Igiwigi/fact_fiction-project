The Institute is a mere youngster compared with the Royal Society. We will celebrate our 150th
anniversary in 1998 and our Royal Charter was granted nearly 200 years after the societyâ€™s. As a
professional body we differ in some respects from a scientific society. There are three necessary aspects
to being a professional man or woman. First, in relation to our own profession, actuarial science is an
applied science which is usually applied in the specialist areas of insurance and pensions but has wider
applications when we consider that our basic tools are risk analysis and financial modelling. The second
element is judgement. We are a practical profession that is required to advise our employers and clients
on the best solutions to real problems.

Analysis and mathematics only take us so far. We have to judge how best to make certainty out of
uncertainty. These two functions of applied science and judgement can variously be described as the
known and the supposed, the factual and the conjectural, the deductive and the intuitive, the rational
and the instinctive.

The third element is equally important. We are required to act in the public interest and must
therefore live up to high ethical and professional standards. These three elements apply to each
individual actuary in his or her daily work but they are reinforced by our professional bodies in the code
of conduct and guidance we give our members.

It is hard to think of a better example of the need to use applied science, professional judgement and
ethical standards than the subject of genetic testing. The objectives for the actuarial profession are first
to ensure that our members are as well informed as possible on the facts and the information coming
from genetic scientists and the medical profession so that they can exercise their professional judgement,
as we do in other areas, on an informed basis. The second objective is to ensure that our members
