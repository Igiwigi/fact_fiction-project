To this view however it may be objected that all the species of sngar capable of
fermentation with which we are acquainted contain 12 equivs. of carbon. Indeed it
is difficult to conceive how a body of the formula C,, Hz, O;, can be decomposed into
alcohol and carbonic acid. It is therefore far more probable that the formula of this
substance is C,, Hz, O:z, which is also that of grape-sugar when dried at 100? C. In
fact, were it capable of being crystallized, it would no doubt be considered as iden-
tical with grape-sugar. If this be granted, then it follows that the formula of rubia-
nine mast be either C,, H;, O,; or C,, Hy, Og, as will be seen by the following equa-
tions :=
