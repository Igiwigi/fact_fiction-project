nutrients and other necessary resources [4]. Most invasive cancers infiltrate col-
lectively [5], which defines malignant function, and cancer aggression is likened
more to collective cell migration than to single-cell migration [6]. At the other
end of the spectrum, animals like the great wildebeest must relocate to new
sources of food; their enormous herd size providing protection and a greater
chance of survival from predators during their migration. Collective motion
also appears as an emergent trait in artificial self-propelled particles [7] and
other non-living systems. Thus, collective migration is evident at practically
all scales (figure 1), in both natural and artificial systems.

The universality of this phenomenon [8] has led to intense investigation; col-
lective migration has been studied substantially in animals [1,9], but only
comparatively recently in cells. The fact that collective motion is conserved at
different scales suggests that there may be common, underlying principles
that govern the movement of groups. It has long been noted in animals that
there is a remarkable degree of long-range organization that cannot be apparent
to each individual, meaning there must be some degree of leadership or com-
munication [10]. Likewise, embryonic morphogenesis involves large-scale
