In general, as I
found before in my former experiments, these three piles produced currents the in-
tensity of which was sensibly alike in all. This coincidence seems at first rather
singular, considering the diversity of the internal resistance of the three piles, and
admitting that the electro-motor element of the proper current resides in the leg alone. 'The experiments which I shall report at the close of this memoir, explain this fact
sufficiently clearly. Comparing, however, the three above-mentioned piles, composed from frogs which
had been exposed previous]ly to the action of debilitating causes, I have always found
that the signs of the proper current, in the pile composed of the legs alone, somewhat
exceeded those of the other piles. I would here refer to another experiment, described at page 1:6 of my Treatise,
performed with a pile (fig.
