MR. ROBERT MATIET ON VOLCANIC ENERGY. 149

Close to the volcanic vent the eruptive throes may produce earthquake-impulse before
or after these have broken through the earth's surface; but we cannot phenomenally
conneet most, earthquakes with volcanic action at all, inagmuch as there is, even in the
very greatest, no local change of terrestrial surface-temperature.

We can only refer them to a common origin, if we can discover and describe some
play of cosmical mechanism set in motion by terrestrial heat, that shall be sufficient in
energy to account for all the phenomena, that shall bear examination when brought
into contact with each particular class of well-ascertained facts, either of volcanoes or
of earthquakes or of mountain-chain elevation, that shall leave none of these facts
inexplicable, and that shall 80 link itself on to cosmical physics generally as to be
Sg applicable to like phenomena in other planets than our own, or satellites, 80 far as we
© have facts ascertainable in relation to these.

5 5. Within the limits of this paper it is impossible to enter upon any large discussion of

SZ the theories that have been advanced as to the nature and origin of yolcanic activity and

= elevatory action ; a few remarks upon the notions commonly current on these subjects

= amongst geologists are necessary, however, to point out their more salient defects and
© to contrast the views about to be here adyanced with those which are current.
