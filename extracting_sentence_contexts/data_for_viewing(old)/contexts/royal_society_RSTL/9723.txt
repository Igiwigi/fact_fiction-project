\Sippearances in the tube itself, each 8eparate tube presenting phenomena in any way
Adliffering from those which had been previously observed and classified, had to be
Subjected to a separate examination until the observer became familiar with its
peculiarities. But with the new method this labour is avoided. Only one tube has

elves, are made to express the nature of the intermittence of the discharge that is

This, in fact, supplied synchronous impulses of negative electricity in the manner figured in fig. 164 of the
