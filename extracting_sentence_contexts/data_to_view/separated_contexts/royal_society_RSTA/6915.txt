They there-
fore appear as a load on the crust, and the calculated value of gravity is increased by nearly
100 mgals locally. Since no such anomalies are observed the region must be very nearly in
isostatic equilibrium. This agrees well with the known facts concerning the Fennoscandian
uplift. Niskanen (1939, 1943) and Meinesz (1937) have reviewed the available data, and the
latter concludes that for a linear structure such as the continental shelf, 7, the time taken to
return half-way to the equilibrium position, and /, the linear dimensions perpendicular to
the axis, are connected by the relation Jr=15 x 106 km, years. Taking /=100 km., this gives
T=1+5 x 10Â° years.
