INFLUENCE OF ExtTERNAL ConpITIONS ON Protozoa AND BACTERIA.

The numbers of all the organisms counted show large fluctuations of two kinds,
viz., daily and seasonal, The size of the changes that take place within so short a
time as 24 hours is perhaps the most surprising fact that the experiment has
revealed. Thus the three consecutive samples 246, 247 and 248 give 58°0, 14°25

and 26°25 million bacteria respectively. The changes exhibited by any of the
species of protozoa are at times even larger, and affect the active and encysted
stages apparently quite indifferently. It is, in fact, not uncommon for the numbers
of any species to vary from a few hundred or a few thousand to 400,000 or more
within 24 hours, and the percentage of these in the active condition may jump from
0 to nearly 100 in a similar interval (e.g. Dimastigameba, samples 250, 251;
Cercomonas, samples 221, 222 ; Oicomonas, samples 245, 246; etc.).

In spite of these apparently quite erratic daily changes, when the numbers are
averaged over a considerable period (e.g. fourteen days), marked seasonal changes
became apparent. The whole soil population rises to a maximum at the end of
November, and falls again to a minimum at the end of February or early in March.
The bacteria then rise to a further very high figure at the end of June. The
protozoa are found to fall into two well-marked groups in respect of these seasonal
changes. The curves for Cercomonas and Dimastigameba (fig. 1) run practically
