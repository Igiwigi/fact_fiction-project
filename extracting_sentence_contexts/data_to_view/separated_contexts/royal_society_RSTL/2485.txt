In these, indeed, such a formula is
not actually deyeloped. But in a paper in the London and Edinburgh Journal of
Science®, in the former part of which I have offered a brief abstract of M. Cavcny's
peculiar theory of undulations, some remarks upon it are given, including the de-
duction of a formula in which the relation between the length of a wave and the velo-
city of its propagation is precisely expressed; this last quantity being in fact the
same as the reciprocal of the refractive inder. Without entering any further into theoretical considerations, it will be admitted
that such a formula, (from whateyer source derived,) if found to supply anything like
a representation of the law of nature, or a clue to guide us through the seeming dis-
order which prevails among the experimental results, would be entitled to attention. It has therefore been my object, without reference to the support of a theory, to
examine by means of this formula the relation between the index of refraction and the
length of the period or wave for each definite ray throughout the whole series of nume-
rical results which we at present possess.
