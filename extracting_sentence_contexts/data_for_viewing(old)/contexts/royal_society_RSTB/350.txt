more saliva could be obtained from the gland. His method of obtaining saliva was to
place dilute acids or weak ammonia in the mouth, and so to set up a secretion reflexly.
Tn our Experiments 10 and 11, the injection of strong salt solution distinctly lowers
the amount of saliva that could be obtained from the gland by stimulating the
chorda tympani and by pilocarpin, and, when injected in sufficient amount, prevented
all secretion from taking place, Hence, it seems to us probable that, if the injection
of salts can lead to an increase in the percentage of salts in the saliva above normal,
the amount of salts injected must be regulated with great nicety.

Some REMARKS ON THE THEORY OF SECRETORY NERVES.

We do not propose to discuss the question whether there is more than one kind
of secretory nerve ; but there are some facts in the foregoing experiments bearing on
the question which we cannot leave without mention.

The most striking of these is the effect of bleeding in Experiment 8. The loss of
blood causes an increase in the percentage of organic substance in the saliva.* This
tends to show that with a given stimulus the percentage of organic substance
increases as the blood-flow through the gland decreases. Further, the actual rate of
secretion of organic substance is somewhat decreased by loss of blood, and this may
be fairly interpreted as meaning that with a lessened blood supply the gland-cells
become less irritable. Lastly, loss of blood increases the percentage of salts much less
than it increases the percentage of organic substance; that is to say, the secretion of
salts is much less affected by the strength of stimulus than the secretion of organic
substance.
