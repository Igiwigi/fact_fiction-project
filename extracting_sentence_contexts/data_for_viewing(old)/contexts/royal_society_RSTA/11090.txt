interest were the hardest to obtain. For instance, when the difference in the two
pressures causing the flow through the orifice was very small, only a relatively small
quantity of steam passed through the orifice, which considerably increased the
difficulty of obtaining accurate temperature readings in the wiredrawn steam near the
saturated condition. Those results, however, which have been obtained and plotted
in Diagram 5 show clearly that the actual fall of temperature with pressure is
most accurately represented by a curve which commences at the point on the saturation
curve representing the initial saturated condition of the steam before wiredrawing,
proceeding for a short distance along the saturation curve, and then branching
off from this at an apparently definite angle, proceeding in a regular curve of small
curvature.

The fact that for a short distance the curve approximately coincides with the
saturation curve is very important, as it appears to show that even after the steam
has been relieved of suspended moisture by a process of drainage, the law of pressure
and temperature in the steam follows the law of saturation very closely till saturation

is exhausted, when the steam suddenly follows the law of gases. It should be
remembered, however, that in the actual experiments the wetness of the steam in
the steam chest from which the steam supply is taken was altered as much as possible
in different experiments under the same initial pressures and temperatures, but it was
not found possible to affect the apparent dryness of the steam just before entering the
