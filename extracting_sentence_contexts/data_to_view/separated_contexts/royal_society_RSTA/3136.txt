Also the reversible character of the Schrédinger equation has a purely statistical and
information-theoretic origin, stemming from the symmetric role that two maximal (non-
degenerate) observables play in their mutual conditioning: it is a kind of information-theoretic
relativity principle, asserting that, from the point of view of statistical predictions, there exist no
priviliged set of maximal compatible observables. The last section (§5) is devoted to non-trivial geometric generalizations of the quantum
formalism which includes gauge theories and may be of independent interest. The fact that the
assumptions are so few explains why the deductive chain is long and sometimes complex. But
the conceptual implications of this mathematical tour de force are relevant for the interpretation
of quantum physics because no theory requires, for its interpretation, more than is required
for the interpretation of its axioms. As, in the present approach, the axioms do not require the
introduction of properties such as non-reality, objectification, non-locality, non-separability, . . ., it
follows that the interpretation of quantum theory can do without these things and students shall
no longer be obliged to learn them.
