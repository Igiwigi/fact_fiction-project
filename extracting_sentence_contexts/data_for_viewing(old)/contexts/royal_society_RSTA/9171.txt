for the height increases from the normal value at a rate (h/—h)/d, very closely for a

unit increase in #, when « is positive. It decreases at the same rate when « is

negative, or to the left, so that both sides of the distorted curve are included. As

stated above, the correction is, in fact, not very important in the subsequent

calculations, its inclusion affecting only the third significant figure in the final
~Separation of the components deduced in the case of H,. In a calculation of
Sseparation, or distance between the axes of two overlapping parabolas, the effect along
Bu is naturally the more significant.
