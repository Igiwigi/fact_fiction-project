inverse faces in the quadrant (111...211).

Facts presented by these Tables â€”The most important of these are the horizontal ranges
of nearly equal angles, as shown in each system, and the general disagreement in the
symbols of the faces which make with some other face those nearly agreeing angles.

With regard to these facts no difference of opinion can arise, unless the sources from
which they have been derived (some of the most recent works on mineralogy) are incorrect.
And it is possible that from inaccurate transcription, or error in printing, some of the -
angles may not be correctly given, and hence perhaps may have arisen some of the
anomalies presented by the Tables.

But differences of opinion may be entertained relative to the interpretation of these facts.

The interpretation to which the writer inclines, is that the near agreement in angle
between two corresponding faces is not simply accidental, but that it is the effect of some
natural relation, not hitherto noticed, among all the crystals in each respective system ;
and hence that where the angles between particular faces nearly agree, there ought to
be a corresponding agreement in the forms of their symbols.

It would seem from these disagreements between angles and symbols that a tacit
impression has existed in the minds of crystallographers, that the crystals of different
minerals are always to be regarded as individual and isolated cases of crystallization,
except in the instances of isomorphous groups.
