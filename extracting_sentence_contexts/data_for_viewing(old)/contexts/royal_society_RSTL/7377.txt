that is, the greater the number of atoms of the same kind and the same atomic heat which are united to those
elementary atoms whose atomic heat is assumed to be unequal, The difference in the atomic heats of © and As,
for instance (1-8 and 6-4), is relatively far greater than for Ca © ©, and K As O, (20:2 and 24-8),

+ It is possible, for example, that certain indecomposable bodies which only approximately obey DuLoxe and
Pemrr's law, are analogous compounds of simpler substances of essentially different atomic heat; the approximate
agreement of the atomic heats of such indecomposable bodies would then depend on & similar reason to that for
tho atomic heats of Ca © ©, and K As ©,. Compare the preyious note.

in the nature of the case that the certain basis of fact and of what can be empirically de-
monstrated must be left. It must also not be forgotten that these conclusions only allow
something to be supposed as to which of the present indecomposable bodies are more
complex and which of simpler composition, and nothing as to the question what -8im-
pler substances may be contained in the more complex ones. The consideration of the
atomic heats may say something as to the structure of a compound atom, but in general
gives no clue as to the qualitative nature of the simpler substances used in the construc-
tion of the more complex atoms. But even if these suppositions are not free from un-
certainty and imperfection, they appear worthy of attention in a subject which, for
8cience, is still 80 much in darkness, as is the nature of the indecomposable bodies.
