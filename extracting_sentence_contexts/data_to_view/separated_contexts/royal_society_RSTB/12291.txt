Men, however, respond to a lesser extent to all sweat
samples, but still do show a differential brain response to
aggression as contrasted to control sweat. This response
occurs at a relatively late processing stage (P3-2) and is more
prominent in response to female sweat. However, as male par-
ticipants show almost no response to female control sweat, the
significant difference is due to the fact that they still show a
slight response to female aggression signals. A heightened sen-
sitivity to same-sex aggression in males, as proposed by some
authors [22], could not be statistically confirmed by the present
data. However, a weak differentiation of male aggression
signals from male control signals in male participants is
suggested by visual inspection of the grand averages (figure 1)
and direct effect testing (P3-2 amplitude: EMO within male
sweat within men Fj 4,=4.14, p=0.048).
