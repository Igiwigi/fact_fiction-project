(6) Extra-nuclear factors (e.g. cytoplasmic).
(c) Nuclear factors or genes. Environmental circumstances have some effect, but the results cannot be explained
solely by them. The assumption of cytoplasmic factors does not satisfy the facts any
better, and on the whole the most likely explanation seems to be that E-ness is the
product of genes which do not themselves produce a type of sinistrality, but effect a
pull towards dextrality when they are in the presence of the sinistral determining gene. E broods occur more or less abundantly in all our sinistral strains which have been
bred to any considerable extent.; To some degree, therefore, the quality which we
may call “ E-ness ” is present in all our sinistral strains, though groups such as—
