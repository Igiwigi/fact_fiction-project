In five hours, therefore, there was a marked prolongation of the time required for
withdrawal of the foot after immersion in acid (the reflex activity of a control frog _
as tested in the same way is not materially weakened in 24 hours). Since this
prolongation occurred in the case of the right (protected) foot almost pari passu with
that of the left, it was mainly due to an action on the spinal cord. It was not due to
a paralysis of the sensory or motor nerves, for the time required for withdrawing
the right foot, of which the nerve terminals were protected, was lengthened equally
with the time required for withdrawing the left foot ; nor was it an indirect effect
on the cord due to arrest of the circulation, for the circulation in the web of the left
foot was still quite active five hours after the injection.

The fact, however, that in four hours the right foot was withdrawn somewhat more

rapidly than the left, indicated that there was probably also a minor effect on the
poisoned motor nerve.

To determine this, the sciatic nerves were exposed at 5.30 P.M., when it was found
that faradisation of the left sciatic with the secondary coil at 200 mm. induced
contraction of its gastrocnemius muscle, but that the right (protected) gastrocnemius
reacted to similar stimulation of its sciatic nerve with the coil at 260 mm. No crossed
