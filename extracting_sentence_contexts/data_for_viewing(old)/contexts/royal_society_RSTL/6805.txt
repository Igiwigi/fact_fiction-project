Column 10 gives the differences between the mean distances in column 8, and those
in column 9, or DE La Rus—FarLey. The mean of the differences will be seen to be
4-4-1; that is, the distances of the centres of the sun and moon come out greater than
the computed distances by 4-1. This tends to show that the semidiameters of the 8wn
and moon jointly, are less in reality by 4” than their tabular values. It is not intended
to urge this as an absolute proof, but merely as supporting that view, which is further
corroborated by the fact that the first contact occurred later, and the last contact sooner,
than the predicted times. The distances of the swn and moon's centres, obtained by
caleulation from the angular opening of the cusps, will be presently employed to furnish
data respecting the commencement and end of the eclipse, &c. ; and it will be seen that
the times thus obtained differ from those derived from the peripheral distances, and that
they approach more nearly to the predicted times. The optical distortion of the sun's
image would occur in the direction of a radius, and would not affect the numbers derived
from meazurements of the angular opening of the cusps, proyided the picture were con-
centric with the optical axis of the instrument ; while it would affect the numbers based
on the measures of the distances of the sun and moon's peripheries, so that the quantity
4" is probably, from that cause, in excess of the true correction. The measurements of the
angular openings of the cusps, and the measurements of the distances of the peripheries,
both present peculiar difficulties. The difficulty of determining the precise termination
