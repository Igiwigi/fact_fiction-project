As regards the latter point, it is certainly at present considered that
they are not constantly affected by a cerebral lesion, and yet more rarely degenerate
after a hemisection of the spinal cord. As yet, therefore, the method does not afford

as a result,

Nothing, however, can be judged as to such crossing to the other hemisphere being
necessary for bilateral function until it is clearly defined in which part of the body
such functional effects occur.
