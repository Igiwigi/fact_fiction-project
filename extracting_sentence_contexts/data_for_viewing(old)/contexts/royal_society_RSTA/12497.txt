substitute for l,l, P, P, their values in terms of the mean longitudes s and h of the
two bodies, and of the eccentricities ¢, e, of their orbits. When the potential is so
expanded the principle of forced oscillations allows us to conclude that the oscillations
of the sea will be of the same periods and types as the several terms of the potential,
but with amplitudes and phases which can only be deduced from observation. The
oscillations of the sea will not however be necessarily of the simple harmonic form,
and accordingly “‘over-tides” of double and triple frequency have to be introduced in
order to represent the motion according to FourrEr’s method.

This is the plan pursued in the “ harmonic analysis of tidal observations,” and each
simple harmonic oscillation is known by an arbitrarily chosen initial letter.

It is found in fact, as is suggested by theory, that tides of approximately the same
frequency or “speed” have amplitudes approximately proportional to their corre-
sponding terms in the potential, and have their phases retarded by approximately the
same amount.

The notation of harmonic analysis will be adopted here, because it is proposed to
compute the tide table from the harmonic constants.

The mean longitudes of the sun, moon, and lunar perigee are denoted by h, s, p,
and their hourly changes by o, y, @ (from oedjvy, jdvos, perigee); the angular
velocity of the earth’s rotation is y (from yj), so that y — 7 is 15° per hour.

The eccentricities of the lunar and solar orbits are e, e,.
