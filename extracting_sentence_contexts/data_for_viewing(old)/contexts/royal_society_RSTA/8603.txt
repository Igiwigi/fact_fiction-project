one moiecule, it would account qualitatively for all the facts. Such systems, it is well
known, extrapolate for 7 = 0 to vy and vy + C/4, respectively. This would correspond to

a displacement of about 0-03 frequency units at the origin. If C[= h/8x? (1/I’ — 1/1’)]
is a function of m, as is to be expected, owing to the distension of the molecule by
centrifugal force, then we may expect an increasing stagger or displacement of the two
systems for large values of m. This is, in fact, the case, the staggering becoming as
large as 0-6 units at 7 = 70 (it would be at 7 = 35 on this hypothesis).

If this view is correct, it should be possible to relate mathematically the triplet separa-
