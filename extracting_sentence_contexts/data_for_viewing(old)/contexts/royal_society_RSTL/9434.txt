and stretching toward the negative terminal of the tube, while the luminous column
on the positive side of the tinfoil is usually depressed or repelled, and is often well nigh
8evered in two. If the tinfoil be in the form of a ring round the tube the appearance
of the phenomena is very striking. In many cases the luminous column extending

\ from the positive terminal is brought to an abrupt termination and ends in a sharply
Â© defined head, somewhat rounded at the extremity. Around this there is a well
marked hollow cone of luminosity, springing from the inside of the tube immediately
beneath the tinfoil, bright and sharply defined on the outside but hazy and blue on
the inside, which is turned to and in fact surrounds the termination of the positive
column above described. This hollow cone does nob come to an apex on its external
gurface, but passes into a luminous column which stretches away towards the negative
terminal of the tube, and supplies the place of the former luminous column, which
it resembles in all respects (Plate 16, fig. 10), When the air-spark is considerably
Sncreased the truncated luminous column is very much altered ; but as the various
Jorms presented by the phenomena will require a close examination ab a later stage we
ball not detail them here.
The one thing to which it is necessary to call attention ab the present stage in regard
Z, these effects is their complete dissimilarity to those we have described as relief-effects.
s we have shown in a previous section, each part of a tube in which a sensitive dis-
Sharge is passing has a standard relief-effect called the 7o-earth effect, produced by con-
FHecting it with a conducting system of practically infinite capacity. A. continuous
