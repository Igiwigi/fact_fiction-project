After the cessation of the application of the dung, the number of species increased
Son both plots ; but very much more without than with the ammonia-salts. Thus, the
numbers were, in the four separation-years, on plot 2â€”30, 41, 47, and 52, and on plot 1,
Swith the ammonia-ealts, 28, 34, 36, and 34. In fact, under the influence of the residue
Sof the dung alone the number of species rapidly increased, and finally reached that
Swithout manure ; whilst, with the ammonia-salts in addition, the increase was com-
Eparatively very slight, and in the last separation-year there were 18 fewer species
=than without manure, or with the residue of the dung on plot 2, The reduction in the
number, under the influeuce both of the direct application of the dung, and of that of
DS the ammonia-salts, was almost exclusively in miscellaneous species ; and the great
Srelative deficiency of these in the later years, where the ammonia was supplied, is a
Eotriking illustration of the effects of increasing the luxuriance of the grasses in
pacing their competitors. We have thus far given an outline of the differences between the amounts of produce,
the yield of some constituents, and the general botanical character of the herbage, on
the two farmyard-manured plots as compared with the unmanured plot. In considering
the botanical results in more detail, it will conduce to clearness to confine attention in
the first place to the actual and comparative results on plot 2, with the dung or its
residue, and afterwards to trace separately the effects of the addition of the ammonia-
salts.
