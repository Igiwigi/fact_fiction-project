They are all linearly unstable. To summarize, the vortex crystals obtained in this paper give rise to point configurations that
are brought by the existence of the handle structure of the torus. In contrast to the fact that the
N-ring located in the negative curvature region always becomes neutrally stable for sufficiently
large aspect ratio [29], those vortex crystals are mostly linearly unstable except for the asymmetric
vortex crystal consisting of N =5 point vortices on the helical curve xf?) as shown in electronic
supplementary material, figure S1. We also observe that finding vortex crystals on the toroidal

surface with the Brownian ratchet scheme is less probable than those in the plane and on the


sphere. We expect that it stems from the inhomogeneity of the toroidal geometry that is less
symmetric than these surfaces with a constant curvature and without a handle structure.
