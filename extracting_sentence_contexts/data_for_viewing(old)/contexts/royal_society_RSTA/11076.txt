is a good deal, broadening at the angles, is plainly a fine eutectic (fig. 6). A power
of 400 diameters shows this well. This section, even when lightly etched with
bromine, shows no trace of the larger polygonal structure. Both these alloys polished
to very white surfaces. The rod of alloy from which the latter section was cut was
white and brittle with a conchoidal fracture.

At 21:1 atoms we have, after bromine etching, the same brown polygons forming the
mass of the alloy, but now the interstices are filled with a new white body, with
which we shall become familiar later on. We give a drawing, under oblique illumina-
tion, of this alloy (fig. 7). The drawing accurately represents a portion of the surface,
but is rather misleading as to the amount of interpolygonal matter, for if one takes a
general survey of the surface one sees that there is very little of this. We give a photo-
graph (fig. 8) to make this fact clear. Hence the alloy is extremely near to being a pure
substance, nearer, for example, than the previous alloy. After the drawing was made,
the section was subjected to a prolonged etching with strong bromine water. This
brought out very clearly the white interpolygonal substance standing in relief above
the level of the brown. This alloy before polishing was brassy-white with a

conchoidal fracture. Thus near B, on both sides of it, we find the structure
characteristic of an almost pure substance.
