stages in development were found in 1884. Nearly all the different views held
concerning the nature of the female product in Monotremata have been based on
indirect evidence, derived from the anatomy of the adult.

Saw (53 and 54),* who described Hehidna in 1792, and Ornithorhynchus in 1799
(Platypus), classed them with Edentata.

Brumensace (13), after studying the skull in 1801, suggested that they might
prove to be oviparous (14). Sir Everarp Home (35), in the same year, relying
chiefly on the absence of mammary glands and the presence of a cloaca, compared
them with the ovi-viviparous Sharks and Reptiles. In 1803 M. Brrenne GEoFFROY
Sarnt-Hinarre (19) proposed the name “ Monotremata,” without definitely assigning
them a place in the zoological series. Between 1802 and 1819 no new facts were
discovered, and in the text-books the animals were classified, either as Mammals,
between Edentata and Rodentia (Desmargst, 1804), or as forming an appendix quite
at the end of the Mammalian series (‘TrepDEMANN, 1808 ; [LLIGER, 1811), or as outside the
Mammalia, and “ very probably” oviparous (LAMARCK, 1809). In 1812 DE BLAINVILLE
(9) pointed out the resemblance to Reptilia, presented by the urino-genital apparatus
and the shoulder-girdle ; but he considered the resemblances to Mammalia, and espe-
cially to Marsupialia, much more marked. In 1817 Cuvier and Oxen still kept the
