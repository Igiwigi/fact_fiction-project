108 PROF. W. M. HICKS: A CRITICAL STUDY OF SPECTRAL SERIES.

N not constant.—In this case the values of N ave supposed to be different for both
the P and S series. Each series, therefore, requires as before three lines to determine
its constants, and the relations P(o«)= VS(1) and S(#)=VP(1) give two
additional equations to determine the two values of N—say, N, and N,. Unfortunately
the values of the first lines are so uncertain (with exception of NaP(1)) that the
values of N,—N and N,—N vary very largely with the errors in the observed lines.
For instance, in the case of Rb, if L.’s values for P (1) and S (3) be used, N,—N = —12,
N,—N = 1300. IfS.’s values for P (1) and S (3.4) are used, N,—N = 141, N,—N = 651.
In the first case P is reproduced as well as the original, but S not so well; in fact,
S() comes out too large. In the second, P is not so good, and § is better than
with the 1300 difference. The discussion shows, however, that within easy limits of
error the N of P may be taken as constant, and for a provisional value the usual
value of N will do very well.

For Na, using K.R.’s values for S (3.4.5), 5N, = 215, p = °661089, a = —032760,
and the calculated lines for S agree better than the original except, however, (2),
which is —4:28 wrong in place of 1°37. If, however, PascuEn’s 8 (2) is used and
K.R.’s $(3.4), then 8N, = 306, SN, = 588, the limits are considerably altered, and
the calculated results bad. If we make 8N, = 0 and use Pascuen’s § (2) and K.R.’s
S (3), 5N, = 342, and the other calculated lines are all outside the limits. The most
reliable result appears, therefore, to be that calculated from K.R.’s values for § (3.4.5),
