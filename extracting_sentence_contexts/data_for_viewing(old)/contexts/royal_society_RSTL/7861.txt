When the pressure was 1 inch of mercury, the light playing upon the vapour for five
minutes produced no action ; but when it was 10 inches a blue cloud made its appear-
ance in two minutes, and in ten minutes it had almost filled the tube. When the
pressure was 20 inches, the action commenced more quickly, and the cloud generated
was more dense. 'The whirling motions of this cloud appeared to be more brisk than
that of the others examined. With 30 inches of the mixed air and iodide the action
began in a quarter of a minute, and in five minutes a dense cloud was formed through-
out the tube. The purple of the discharged iodine was also very plain in this cloud.

In the preliminary notice of these experiments laid before the Royal Society in June
1868, considerable stress is laid upon the fact that the same rays are absorbed by the
nitrite of amyl in the liquid and in the yaporous state. A layer of the liquid not more
than one-eighth of an inch in thickness was found competent to withdraw from a powerful
beam all the constituents which could effect the decomposition of its vapour. The action.
of the nitrite resembles in this respect that of the sulphate of quinine on the rays which

cause it to fluoresce. Both substances quench the effectual rays close to the surface at
which they enter.

I endeavoured at the time to apply this fact to the solution of the question whether
