positive deflection is the suppression of the terminal positive kick, which I attribute
to the sudden cessation of a masked negative deflection. (Vide supra, fig. 27.)

$11. Effects after Tetanisation.

I have in a previous paper offered evidence that tetanised nerve exhibits signs of
metabolism, and that such signs are throughout similar to the signs characteristic of
the action of carbon dioxide. Guided by the results obtained on nerve by pro-
longed tetanisation, I proceeded to test the effect of prolonged tetanisation upon the
retinal response to light, in the expectation that a retina provoked to activity in this
manner should exhibit signs of increased molecular mobility.

And in point of fact such signs appear in the case of the retina in even more
striking degree than in that of nerve. Moreover they offer a distinct advantage in

that the stimulus is by light. The typical after-effect of tetanisation as regards
nerve is an augmentation of the negative response to electrical stimulation. The
typical after-effect of tetanisation as regards the retina is an augmentation of the
positive response to luminous stimulation.
