corresponding to a single mode of momentum k. In our stringy-RVM model Mp\/Ms is
determined by (3.8). This T? scaling for the b KR axial background during the late eras of the
Universe prompts one to conjecture that today

Btoday ~ ¥2¢'Ho Mp1, (5.2)

in analogy to (3.9), with Hp the present-epoch Hubble parameter. From (5.1), this allows for an
estimate of ¢’ as a function of the amplitude of the present-era cosmic magnetic field intensity B(to)
[46]. The latter is a phenomenological parameter, and cannot be determined from first principles
in string theory, in view of the ground state string landscape issue. Nonetheless, if we take into
account that in the presence of a B(to) #0, the cosmic energy density acquires a component ee =
1B2(to), we observe [46] that ¢’ ~ (B(to)2/M3,H3) = 2(p8/p.), with p = H3M3,/3 the critical
density of the Universe. On using the fact [46] that the slow-roll parameter of b(x) measures
the ratio of its kinetic energy, Kp ~ (1 /2)b2, to the critical energy density of the Universe, pc =
(Mp)H)?/3, and making the further phenomenological assumption that this KR axion field plays
the role of the dominant DM component in the Universe [45,46], with K, ~ 0.1U, where U is its
potential energy (as typical in slow-roll, quintessence-like, field situations), one can get the DM
content in the right ballpark [2]: no =(omo/ po) ~ (U/ 0.) ~ 10(Ky/p) ~ 10e = O(0.1), with
Pmo the current energy density of DM in the Universe, provided

where € defines the slow roll of b during the RVM inflationary era (3.9). This ‘coincidence
issue’ needs to be understood better, in terms of microscopic string theory models. For
our phenomenological purposes here, we only note that the result (5.3) implies a KR axion
