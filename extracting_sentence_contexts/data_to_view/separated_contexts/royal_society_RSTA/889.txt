Let us denote the second connected component Gres. We can then see that if after
performing the single-qubit Clifford operations corresponding to m, we only measure the qubits
in Nyc) in the standard basis, followed by corrections, we arrive at the following state

IG) ®|Grest) ® (&) |+)v- (4.3)

veNy@

The entanglement in |Gyest) is then not wasted. Since there are in fact multiple sequences of
vertices m such that tm(G)[V(G’)] =G’, one can also try to minimize the neighbourhood Nyc’
and therefore maximize the size of |Grest).

5. Efficient algorithm based on theorem by Courcelle

As mentioned, we show in another paper [12] that the problem of deciding if G’ is a vertex-minor
of G is NP-Complete in general. Fortunately, the problem is fixed-parameter tractable in the rank-
width of G and in general the size of G’, which follows from results by Oum & Courcelle [25] as
we show below.
