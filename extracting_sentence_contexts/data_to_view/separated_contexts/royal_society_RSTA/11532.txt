The model above described is
so to speak made of eether, and ought to represent all the tractions that exist in
wether, vanishing as they do over the surface of a conducting region: but the model
does not in the ordinary sense represent matter at all, except in so far as the eethereal
strain-form which constitutes the electron is associated with matter. It therefore
cannot represent directly, after the manner of a stress across a medium, a force

acting on matter, for that would from this ultimate standpoint be a force acting on a
strain-form spreading from its nucleus all through the medium, not a traction on a
detinite surface bounding the matter. The fact is that transmission of force by a medium, or by contact action so-called,
remains merely a vague phrase until the strain-properties of that medium are
described ; the scientific method of describing them is to assign the mathematical
function which represents its energy of strain, and thence derive its relations of
stress by the principle of virtual work ; a real explanation of the transmission of a
force by contact action must be taken to mean this process. Now in an elastic
medium permeated by centres of permanent intrinsic strain, whether it be the
rotational ether with its contained electrons, or an ordinary elastic solid permeated
by polar strain-nuelei as described above, the specification of the strain-energy of the
medium involyes a mathematical function, not only of the displacement at each
material point of the medium, but also of the positions of these intrinsic strain-
centres which can move independently through it. To derive the play of internal
force, this energy function must be varied with respect to all these independent
quantities ; the result is elastic tractional stress in the medium across every ideal
interface, together with forcive tending to displace each strain-centre, which we can
consider either as resisted by extraneous constraint preventing displacement of the
strain-centre, or as Compensated by the reaction of the inertia of the strain-form
against acceleration.* Consider, for example, the analogy of the elastic solid medium,
and suppose a portion of it to be slowly strained by extraneous force ; two strains
are thereby set up in it, namely that strain which would be thus originated if the
solid were initially devoid of intrinsic strain, and that strain which has to be super-
posed in order to attain the new configuration of the intrinsic strain arising from the
displacement of its nuclei.
