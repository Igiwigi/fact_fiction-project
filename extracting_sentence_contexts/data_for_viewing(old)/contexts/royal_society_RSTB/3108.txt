Three more questions may be considered in relation to assimilation, namely,
(1) the age of leaves forming intumescences, (2) the effect of wdlwmination, and (3) of
temperature.

(1) As before stated, intumescences form most readily in young but mature leaves,
not only because in such leaves the powers of assimilation are greater than in
developing or degenerating leaves, but also because old tissues lose their irritability,
and therefore their capability of response to stimuli. There are, however, some
exceptions to this rule, as, for example, in Vitis and Solanum in my own experi-
ments, in the Pelargonium brought to the laboratory in November, in the case of the
vine observed by SoravER,t and of the pinks described by Priumux.}

SorAvER, in fact, regards the formation of intumescences as a sign of depressed
vitality, and therefore of reduced powers of assimilation, and PRILLIEUX is inclined to
agree with him.

The case of the pinks cited by Prim.ieux is peculiar because the disease
appeared in plants in the open, towards the end of summer, in August and
September. The author gives no figures and does not say whether the disease
appeared in wet or dry weather, though he notes that the plants had been freely
watered.

When formed experimentally, intumescences are never developed rapidly on older
leaves, but only quite slowly, nor are they so large as those on younger leaves, even
under the same external conditions.
