according to a statement by Mivarr (1881), there may be two. MILLAts (1904), says that it is uncertain
whether this species has one or two breeding seasonsin a year. ‘“ The young are usually born in May, two
to five in number .... The probability is that wild Cats breed only once in the twelvemonth, but I have
seen young animals killed in Scotland in October which certainly could not have been more than 40 days
old, The mother must have dropped them as late as the end of August or the beginning of September.”

Mr. ALFRED HENEAGE Cocks in a letter to Mr. Mriiats says: “I have received wild Cats barely full
grown at such times as would lead me to suppose that they were born rather later than May, but hardly
so late as September ; the latest of these which I noted on receipt was probably barely six months old on
February 15. It was therefore probably born about the latter part of August, but may not have been born
until September. In captivity I have never observed a female wild Cat come in season during the summer

Many years, when owing to the death of the young or the fact that the pair had not bred
together in the spring, I have kept male and female together all summer, but they have shown no
inclination to breed.” {

+ The period of gestation in the Wolf is 63 days (Dublin Zoo) ; that of the Fox is said to be two months,
or about the same time (MILLAIS, 1904).

} Ina more recent letter Mr. Cocks informs us that the old female in his possession came in season and
took the male last autumn (1904), after the death of the kittens which were born earlier in the same year.
