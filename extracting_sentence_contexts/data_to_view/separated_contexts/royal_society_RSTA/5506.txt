It is known that the Fe surface functions as a catalyst and forms a graphitic
shell structure with a 002 surface orientation. This suggests that electrically conductive carbon
materials can be produced directly from woody biomass. In fact, this type of graphitic carbon has
been used as an anode material for Li- and Na-ion batteries, and its storage capacity is similar
to that of artificial graphite [12]. In order to synthesize ORR catalysts from biomass with high
efficiency, it is necessary to ensure that the dopants Fe and N are present in a high concentration
and are well dispersed. The hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) technique is the best method for synthesizing these
materials.
