Such wisdom is further reinforced by the natural association of many-body complexity with a
form of chaos [17,18] and the confirmation that quantum dynamics of classically chaotic systems
should manifest a dynamical instability [19] which leads to an environment-independent decoherence
rate [20,21]. During the last decade, solid-state NMR has kept on providing a versatile testing bench
to study time reversal in large spin arrays [22-26]. In fact, a standard experiment involves a
crystalline sample with an infinitely large number of spins. By contrast, the numerical test of
many-spin dynamics has to be restricted to strictly finite systems [27,28]. While this appears to
be a major limitation, it allows the analysis of a situation that the experiments cannot achieve:
moving progressively from small systems to larger ones with a fully controlled perturbation.
