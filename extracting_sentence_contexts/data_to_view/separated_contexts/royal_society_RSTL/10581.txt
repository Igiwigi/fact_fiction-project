Its
R absolute value is very remarkable. B=14,500 (the residual value) corresponds to an
intensity of magnetism (J) of 1150 c.g.s. units of moment per unit of volume. Greab
as this is, ib was even slightly exceeded in another experiment with the same wire, in
which 93 per cent. of the induced magnetism remained after the magnetising force
was removed, giving a residual intensity of 1200 e.g.s. units of moment per unit of
volume. $0 far as T am aware no steel magnet ever holds 80 much magnetism as this.
: In fact, if by retentiveness we mean simply the faculty of remaining magnetic when
magnetising force is removed, and in the absence of mechanical or other disturbance,
| Soft iron is far more retentive than either hard iron or steel.
