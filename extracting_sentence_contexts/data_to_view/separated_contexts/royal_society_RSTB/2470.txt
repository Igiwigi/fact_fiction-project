The second
difficulty cannot, however, be so easily set aside. I am not aware that brown
sclerenchymatous tissue is ever found within the central cylinder except in the pith. This raises a grave doubt as to whether it can be regarded as intrastelar when it is
present in the medulla, In O. cinnamomea the doubt becomes a certainty by the
fact that the brown sclerenchyma in many cases is actually in histological continuity
with the similar tissue of the outer cortex. It is possible to take another view of the matter, viz., that the primitive condition

is one in which the pith and cortex are the same in origin. This hypothesis has the
advantage of raising no difficulties in the case of O. cinnamomea.
