Plant tumours are characterized by both abnormal prolifer-
ation and large cell size [166], suggesting that proliferation
inhibition and resource allocation cheating may contribute
to these growths. Plant tissue architecture and development differs from
animal tissue architecture and development in ways that
are likely to be important for cancer suppression. In fact,
some have argued that plants are not particularly susceptible
to cancer because plant tissue architecture and development
keeps cells fixed in place within the cell wall matrix, con-
straining the capacity of neoplastic plant cells to freely
travel through plant tissue in order to invade and metastasize
[167]. However, some papers have reported metastasis-like
phenomena in plants, with tumour strands emanating from
primary plant tumours [166]. Bacteria-free tumours have
also been reported at secondary sites without the apparent
presence of tumour strands [159].
