Havine been occupied with the study of the minute representation of motor
function in the cortex of the Bonnet Monkey (Macacus sinicus), it seemed to us
extremely necessary to investigate the character of such representation in the cortex
of an anthropoid Ape, in order that we might form a more correct estimate of the
mode of localisation in Man. <A comparative study of the brains and habits of the
more easily obtainable anthropoids showed clearly that for our object the Orang was
more suitable than the Chimpanzee, in being likely to afford results nearer to those
presumed to exist in Man. We therefore procured a young Orang which, in the
opinion of Professor D. J. CunnincHam, of Trinity College, Dublin, was about
23 years old,
In addition to excitation of the cortex, we also investigated the movements obtained
by stimulating the fibres of the internal capsule.
We shall therefore arrange the facts as follows :—
