consequence of the basic premise of the LI approach, namely that current scientific knowledge
derives, through cognitive processes in the human brain, from the discrete events which are
observed in laboratory experiments and from relationships between those events that we,
humans, discover. These discrete events are not ‘generated’ according to certain quantum laws:
instead these laws appear as the result of (the best) LI from the data.

This viewpoint seems completely in line with Bohr’s view [34]: ‘Physics is to be regarded not
so much as the study of something a priori given, but rather as the development of methods of
ordering and surveying human experience. In this respect, our task must be to account for such
experience in a manner independent of individual subjective judgment and therefore objective in
the sense that it can be unambiguously communicated in ordinary human language.’ This, in our
opinion, is exactly what the LI approach allows us to do. The extraordinary descriptive power of
quantum theory then follows from the fact that it is plausible reasoning, that is common sense,
applied to robust experiments.

From our LI derivations of some of the most basic equations of quantum theory, it follows
that the latter describes only robust experiments. This is best illustrated by comparing the (high)
accuracy by which quantum theory predicts, say, the ratios of the wavelengths of the Balmer
absorption/emission lines of hydrogen [57] with the comparably low accuracy of say EPRB
experiments that purport to provide evidence for the singlet state of two spin-5 particles [39,50].
In the former case, the high accuracy originates from doing a massive amount of experiments
on a very large collection of identical atoms and, as in any statistical experiment, what we
observe most of the time is the most robust response. Thus, the solution of the LI problem (e.g.
the Schrédinger equation in the case at hand) is the one that is ‘observed’ most frequently. By
contrast, in experiments that provide data on an event-by-event basis, the statistical samples
