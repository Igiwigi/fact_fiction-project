Since these definitions were penned we have learnt much about Halonia and Ulo-
dendron. In Memoir I. (Joc. cit., p. 225) I expressed my strong conviction that the
tubercles, alike of Ulodendron and of Halonia, represent short abortive branches
destined to support strobiloid forms of fructification, The accuracy of this conclusion
was set at rest for ever when Professor D’Arcy THompson discovered and described

_ one of the forms of the so-called Ulodendron minus, with the strobilus in situ, attached
to its Ulodendroid scar. That the Haloniw were young terminal branches, and not
roots, as many, including Bronenrart himself, were inclined to believe, was in like
manner set at rest, first by the final demonstration that the Stigmarie were the true
roots of. the Lepidodendra, and, secondly, by my publication of the figure of the grand
specimen in the museum of the Leeds Philosophical Society,* which settled, beyond
all possibility of question, the fact that Halonie were the terminal divisions of Lepi-
dodendroid branches. Starting from this foundation, I shall proceed to examine such
facts as we are now acquainted with bearing upon this question.

14 PROFESSOR W. C. WILLIAMSON ON THE ORGANIZATION

In the first place Bronenrarr’s division of Ulodendra and Halonia into two groups,
in the former of which the tubercles are in the centre of large flattened scars arranged
in two vertical series on opposite sides of the stem, whilst in the latter we have
numerous rows of similar tubercles arranged quincunctially, can no longer be
