A. Brooker of the Mathematical Laboratory, Cambridge, who undertook the
‘programming’ of the problem and its solution on the E.D.S.A.C. IN AN ELASTIG MEDIUM WITH A SINGLE SURFACE LAYER — 259

found that such a transformation is possible and that we do, in fact, obtain as the dominant
motion a certain superposition of the free waves which may be propagated over the surface
of the elastic system. We shall first investigate these free-surface waves without reference to
the generating pulse. PART II.
