Meduse,—In all Acalephe the digestive cavity is prolonged into a system of canals
into which the contents of the stomach pass by direct communication. The gastro-
vascular channels are to the Acaleph what the visceral cavity or the bollow interior
of the polypidom is to the Polype. In both cases the contained fluid consists of a
chylaqueous compound. In both, the containing chambers and canals are lined by
a vibratile epithelium.

* I have recently succeeded in bringing under direct demonstration the movements of the fluid in the peri-
gastric cavity of the little freshwater Hydra. The distal ends of the tentacles are imperforate, The fluid is
charged with minute oleous molecules. This marvellous little being is no longer an organic paradox. Its
fluids and solids are now intelligible ; the essential elements of its organism are unravelled.

+ I had repeatedly and beyond doubt established this fact (by numerous observations on several species of
Pulmograde and Cirrhigrade Medusz found in the Bay of Swansea and the Bristol Channel) long before the
advantage occurred to me of perusing the valuable paper of Mr. HuxLzy in the Philosophical Transactions © On
the Anatomy and Affinities of the Family of the Medusz,” Part II. 1849. With reference to the digestive
cavity of the Cryptocarp and Phanerocarp families Mr. HuxLzy remarks, © Whatever its appearance, it will
always be found to be compozed of two membranes, an inner and an outer, These differ but little in structure ;
both are cellular, but the inner is in general softer, less transparent and more richly ciliated.” In the same
paper a similar observation occurs in relation to the Rhizostomidz, but from his memoir I cannot discover that
