The prevailing notion concerning the physiological function of representation of
movement in the spinal cord is certainly that the fibres along which the stimulus
passes when the posterior roots are excited, are short are fibres, i.¢., limited horizontally
to the segment they enter. This simple view, however, is not borne out by the results of my experiments, as
will be seen by the following account. It was soon found that there were two sets of facts giving evidence of a different
kind which showed (1) that the arrangement of the centres and their afferent fibres
was more complex, and (2) that some change could be brought about within the centres
by stimulation of the posterior roots which affected the excitability of the anterior
roots,

(a.) Character of Movement Elicited from the Respective Roots. There is a marked difference in the kind of contraction of the muscle, that from

the anterior root being sharp, and that from the posterior root being more slowly
developed. OF MOVEMENTS IN THE MAMMALIAN SPINAL CORD. 207

(b.) Kind of Movement Obtained from the Respective Roots.
