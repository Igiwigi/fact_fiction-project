Trans.,’ vol. 167, pp. 217 et seq.) , when de-
scribing a new rhizome and its petioles, under the name of Rachiopteris corrugata,
I gave at some length my reasons for not multiplying generic names for these
curious plants ; pointing out how wholly impossible it was to classify recent Ferns
on any such basis, a fact the importance of which is further illustrated by the
rhizome which I am about to describe. Some weeks ago, my young auxiliary collector, Mr. Lomax, to whom I was indebted
for the Calamitean fruits described in my last memoir, Part XIV., brought me a
specimen having the central vascular axis of M. Renauur’s Anachoropteris Decaisnii,
with petioles of the true Zygopteroid type : thus demonstrating that the axis found
by Renavtr in connection with a petiole of Corpa’s type of Anachoropteris was
equally the axis of a Zygopteroid petiole. The specimen has been a drifted fragment,
now imbedded in a hard ganister full of Goniatites.
