Whether this be so or not, it will be safer for the present purpose to define the
vicinal faces of the growing alum crystal by their actual angles than by their possible
indices. One reason why I am led to believe that they are really referable to rational,
although not to simple, indices is the following :â€”During the growth of the crystal,
one set of vicinal faces is being continually replaced by another along certain zones ;
each image of the collimator signal fades away like a dissolving view and another
makes its appearance ; but the change is not gradual, neither are the surfaces curved ;
one plane reflecting-surface is replaced by another plane; and although the images
may for a time be multiple and confused, sharply defined images emerge successively

by the substitution of one image for another per saltwm.

This extremely important fact is illustrated by some of the
examples quoted above, and instances might be multiplied
to any extent.

It is sufficient here to record the well-defined faces which
have been observed during the experiments upon potash-
alum and ammonia-alum.

If a, B, y (fig. 12) be the three images obtained from

three facets belonging to the same form, then if o be the
position of the image which would be yielded by the ideal
octahedron face, the readings actually made in the course of the observations
