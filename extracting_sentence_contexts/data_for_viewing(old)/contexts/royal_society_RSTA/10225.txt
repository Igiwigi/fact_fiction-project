high, and then the solution on the top a few millims. over the ebonite partition. The
mercury, solid salt and solution were mixed at the quartz windows of the vessel
and SO,Hg, entangled between the Hg and the quartz windows, so as to get vertical
SO,Hg, electrodes (besides SO,Hg, being on the top). Two glass capillary tubes,
sealed up at one end with long pieces of platinum wire leading from the closed ends
and fixed in the ebonite top piece, were filled with mercury and the ebonite piece
cautiously fixed in the quartz vessel. The heating of the HgPt junctions by light
was thus as far as was practicable avoided.

It was soon found that the E.M.F. considerably changes with the quantity of
mereury. The greater the amount of mercury (the vertical surface of SO,Hg.) the
smaller the deflection—this is evidently due to the fact that the E.M.F. obtained is
principally a thermo E.M.F. The E.M.F. obtained depends upon how the solid

$O,Hg, was mixed up with the mercury. For this reason no comparative experi-
ments with different systems can be made.

Tn all cases however we get constant cells, showing no polarisation, and the current
always passed from the electrode in the dark to the electrode in light, as in all cells
reversible in respect of the anion. Plate N23 gives an illustration of this for the
