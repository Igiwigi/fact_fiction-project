Parr II.
The Theory of Divergent Series.

§ 23. The development of the theory of divergent series is an interesting instance
of the progress of mathematical thought. The beginning was purely arithmetic: to
find some approximation to the value of 7!, where n is a very large integer.* In the
result it appeared that the value of log 7! could be more and more nearly calculated by

adding on successive terms of a series proceeding by powers of = The error is of the
a

order of magnitude of the term of the series next after the one at which we stop.
And, most important fact of all, the series is divergent.

If n! be replaced by T(x + 1), a similar result can be obtained, which holds for all
real positive values of 7.

Finally, there comes the enquiry as to what meaning, if any, can be attached to the
equality in the case in which 7 is any complex quantity.

Other approximations undergo the same process of development, so that it becomes
necessary to try and construct a formal theory.

What we may call the arithmetic theory has been given by Porncart,?{ for the
case in which all the quantities involved are real :—a restriction which the author
