us consider a discrete-time evolution, as schematically shown in figure 1, and an initial system
state which is mathematically represented by

x(t + 1) = f[x()]
and x(t = 0) = xo,

(4.1)

where xo defines initial conditions (IC). The microscopic evolution of the system is defined as a
low-level evolution process (LLEP) and, after some time, it will lead to a stable or metastable
emergent pattern, i.e. a high-level phenomenon (HLP). Note that we did not specify if f[-]
is deterministic or stochastic, and if the system is open or closed, since any combination of
them is plausible, in principle. In fact, if the system is open and the dynamical rules are
deterministic, the contingencies of the flux of parts and states through S provide additional
external conditions, whereas if the system is closed there is only one external condition, i.e.
the initial one. If the dynamics is stochastic, then accidental effects provide additional external
conditions. It is clear as a full knowledge of S, f[-], x9 and eventual external conditions
might allow, through computational analysis, to evolve microstates and observe unexpected
macrostates. Summarizing:

— Non-emergent phenomena: knowledge of LLMR and IC allows us to deduce expected
HLP;

— Weakly emergent phenomena: knowledge of LLMR and IC allows us to deduce
unexpected HLP through computation (e.g. simulations);
