(26.) applicable to this case, and which the masterly investigations of Farapay bid
fair to evolve: every one conyersant with this interesting branch of science must
necessarily allow, that never before has it been enriched by results 80 comprehensive
and momentous as those contained in his several series of researches. It is also
to be further considered, whether at small distances, although the force between two

particles should be as x32, still the force between the plates may be as S simply, the

whole attraction being found bya double integration, which sums all the forces, every
particle of A being supposed to attract every particle of B.

38. The preceding facts lead us to refer every case of attraction in electricity, in
a non-conducting or insulating medium, to the conditions of that peculiar combina-
tion of electrics and conductors, termed the Leyden jar, or coated pane, a com-
bination consisting of an insulating body, interposed between two conducting sur-
faces. Now it is admitted that the charge which this combination can receive, is
quite independent of the thickness of the opposed conductors, or of any hypothetical
distribution upon them, or other bodies in connexion with them. Thus the charge
which the electrical jar can receive under a given intensity, is as great when the
coatings are mere films of metallic leaf, as when a solid mass of metal ; the only con-
dition essential to the perfect snccess of the experiment, is the free state of one of
the coatings, and the complete insulation of the other, as also their close approxima-
tion. The action of the coatings in this case is reduced to one of these cases already
given (16.), in which the distance between the bodies is constant, and the quantity of
