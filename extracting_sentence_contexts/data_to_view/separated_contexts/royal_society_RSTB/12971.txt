Others reject the idea that differences in conscious states map onto differ-
ences in behavioural states. Often, this is framed as the idea that there is
continuity between dreaming and waking. This continuity can refer to the
fact that we tend to dream of things we experience, think, or worry about in
waking [2-4]. Or it can mean that dreams are the same type of mental state
as waking imagination and daydreams and both are distinct from perception
[5]. More recently, dreaming has been described as an intensified form of
waking mind wandering existing on a continuum of spontaneous experiences
