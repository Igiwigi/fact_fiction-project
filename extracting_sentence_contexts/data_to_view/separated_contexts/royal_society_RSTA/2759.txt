Thus, we can define orthonormal

Hence, the configuration space of spherical dumbbell is SO(3, R). In fact, we can consider it as a
rigid body with tensor of inertia

0 0 mo + my

Eigenvalues of I give the following principal moments of inertia:

=m tm+A), b= (mo+m—-A), b=motm, A= (mo = 11)? + 4c? mom. Finally, the spherical dumbbell equations of motion can be written in the following form:

d d A

where 2 = (21, 22, 23) is the angular velocity of the frame Fg projected to the axis of this frame,
A=[a;;] €SO(,R) is the orientation matrix of frame Fg with respect to the inertial frame with
entries dj; =e; - bj, for i,j =1,2,3. Matrix @ has the form

Summarizing, the spherical dumbbell is equivalent to a rigid body with one fixed point and with
the tensor of inertia satisfying + In — 13 =0.
