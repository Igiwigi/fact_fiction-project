If information does in fact play a causal role in the dynamics of biological aed
systems, than a fundamental understanding of life as a physical process has the potential to 22
open up completely unexplored sectors of physics, as we know of no other class of physical : Sg
systems where information is necessary to specify its state. Taking a more forward-thinking DNS
and necessarily speculative look at what our results suggest of the physics underlying life, we : a
regard the most distinctive feature to be in how informational and causal structure intersect : &

(consistent with other suggestions that life is distinguished by the ‘active’ use of information,
e.g. [22,31,40-43]). Evidence for this view comes from the fact that the integration of the network
is a better predictor of the states of individual nodes, than vice versa (figure 8), an asymmetry
perhaps related to the functionality of the network. If the patterns of information processing
observed in the biological network are indeed a joint product of information and causal structure,
as our results suggest, they may be regarded as an emergent property of topology and dynamics. The informational signatures of biological networks uncovered by our analysis appear strongly
dependent on the controllability of the network—that is, that a few nodes regulate the function
of the cell-cycle network.
