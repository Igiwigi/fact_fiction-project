The work of the “ Bache” was carried out in January, February and
March, 1914, in connection with the programme of the International Council for the
Study of the Sea, in the Gulf Stream area and along two sections between Bermuda
and the United States coast. The collection consisted of several hundred murznoid
larvee, among which I found thirty-seven specimens belonging to the genus Anguilla,
taken near Bermuda or in the waters between there and the United States. Closer
examination showed that only six of these thirty-seven belonged to the American
species, the remainder being larvee of Anguilla vulgaris, 4-5 cm. in length, Thus the
collections from the “ Bache” furnished additional evidence of the mysterious fact
that, as we had shown in 1913, the larvee of the European eel may, even in the
American waters of the Atlantic, predominate greatly over those of the species of eel
which has its habitat in America. A remarkable feature of the case was that at more
than one of the “ Bache’s” stations, as also of the “ Margrethe’s,” larvee of both
species were brought up in the same net at the same time. I shall later, in dealing
with the investigations undertaken by the schooner ‘Dana,’ return to this point,
which I found altogether incomprehensible at the time.
