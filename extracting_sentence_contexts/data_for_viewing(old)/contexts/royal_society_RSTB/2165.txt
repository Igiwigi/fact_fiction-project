We accordingly, in a dog, injected about # of a grain of morphine acetate, to which
about j/pth of a grain of atropine was added. To our surprise, after the nerves were
severed, injection of choline and cerebro-spinal substance produced, like neurine, a
rise of blood-pressure. i

Remembering, however, the antagonism which is well known to exist between
atropine and choline, it occurred to us that the unusual results might be due to the
employment of atropine. This we later fully confirmed. In animals to which even
such a small dose of atropine had been previously given, injection of choline, or
cerebro-spinal substance, always produced a rise of arterial pressure. We give
illustrative tracings of this effect (figs. 39 and 40). The uppermost line shows that
the lever of the intestinal oncometer also rises. The effect appears to be mainly due
to action on the heart. The fact is not without importance as showing that the
action of one poison may materially modify the action of another, and this is not
entirely without bearing on the study of the disease we wished specially to investi-
gate. We shall return to this in our concluding remarks.

Tn the case of neurine, after the animal has been anesthetised with morphine and
atropine, there is only a rise of blood-pressure, and this is accompanied by the usual
constriction of peripheral vessels (fig. 41).
