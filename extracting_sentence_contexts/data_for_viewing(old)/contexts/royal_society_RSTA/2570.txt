mathematical results
In this article, I try to argue that a mathematical proof

considered as a text proves nothing except the fact of the

Author for correspondence: existence of proofs. Traditional proofs are not proofs in
Nikolai Vavilov the logical sense, but rather road maps, consisting of a
e-mail: nikolai-vavilov@yandex.ru conceptual description of the main ideas and some key

arguments. It is a fact that traditional proofs are—and
always were!—full of errors and gaps of all sorts. At
present, very few serious mathematical results can be
completely formalized and, outside of very few cases,
such a complete formalization would be simply an
insupportable and unjustified misuse of resources.

At the current state of affairs, before the advent
of an artificial intelligence that could fully match our
natural stupidity, complete formalization of the full
body of mathematical knowledge is neither possible,
nor desirable. A formalized proof presented as a
sequence of elementary steps can be a useful instrument.
