agents are favoured. Section 3 includes rational agents in the system that aim to determine their
optimal risk factor to maximize their expected wealth. We find that the agents become selective
in their interactions depending on their wealth. In §4, we summarize the results, draw general
conclusions and point to possible future lines of work.

2. Taxation with target redistribution

Let’s start by studying the effect of a flat tax system on wealth distribution in a system of non-
rational agents. For that purpose, we use the Yard—Sale model for the exchange among economic
agents. In a recent contribution of some of us [26], the effect of taxes on the wealth distribution
was studied with individual risk factors r; chosen at random at each exchange. Here we adopt a
model where risk factors are uniformly distributed in the interval [0, 1] given as initial conditions
that remain fixed along time. The fact that individual risk factors are constant is very important,
as the goal of the present paper is to compare with the role of agent’s decisions concerning the
risk factors on the individual and globally distributed wealth.

The simulations of this section and §3 were performed with N = 10° agents and averaged over
10° samples. The total wealth is normalized to 1. We use the Monte Carlo step (MCS) as the unit
of time, defined as the minimum number of steps for all agents to be possible selected (i.e. N/2).
The system evolves until a stationary state is attained. The tax collection in the simulation works
as follows: at each MCS, all agents pay the same fraction 4 of their wealth as taxes.! Then, to
diminish inequality, the total amount collected is redistributed among the p poorest fraction of
the population (the targeted population).

'Taxing wealth is equivalent to taxes on property or fortune, much less widespread than the income tax. However, we choose
