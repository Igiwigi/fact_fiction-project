Again, he found that the fluid of the green aquatic Frog (Zana esculenta),
when mixed with a large quantity of water, and placed in an ice-house, the tempera-
ture of which he gives at-33 Reavun. (39:87* Fans.) retained its fecundatory property
for thirty-five hours h. But it must be borne in mind, with regard to these observa-
tions, that the species of Toad (Bufo), pair later in the season, and at a higher
: temperature than those of the Frog; and also that the fluid employed by SPALLANZANI
in all his experiments, was obtained by vivisection, either from the testes or the
vesicles; and no doubt contained, as in my experiment just mentioned, many unde-
veloped cells; and, consequently, not being fully matured, retained its influence
longer than it would have done, under the same circumstances, in its perfect con-
dition. But Prevosr and Dumas||, in some experiments made to ascertain the length of
time during which the fluid of the species they experimented on,—the Rana esculenta,
—retains its feeundatory property, observed that it was efficient at {wenty-four hours,
although removed from the body and preserved during that time, in a temperature
that varied from 18 to 22 cents., or from 64' to 71* Faur. | This result, differing 0
much, in regard to temperature, from the results formerly arrived at by SPALLANZANI,
in regard to the Frog, and from the majority of those since obtained by myself, may,
I think, in great part be accounted for in the fact that, like the Toads, the Rana
