In the second species we may assume wW conjugate to —z and y to &, and write
(z+#y) (2+) +(v—7y)(2—iw)=0,
or, what is the same thing,
(a*—9)z—22yw=0,
whence arises the system
(w=nz, a*—2azy—j=0),
which for all real yalues of A gives also real values to the ratio #: y. The double line is
therefore throughout contiguous to the rest of the surface, and the two singular tangent
planes are conjugate. XXII. 2.

[Dr. ScuLipLt has omitted to notice a special form of the ruled surface of the third
order which presented itself to me, and which I communicated to M. CrEMONA and
Dr. Sa1Mox, and which is in fact that in which the transversal coincides with the
double line. For this species, say XXII1. 3, the equation may be taken to be

4 +a(2x+wy)=0 :

construction of the surface a necessary condition was (by an ovyersight of mine) omitted.
'The correct construction is as follows, viz., Given a cubic curve having a double point,
and a line meeting the curve in this point (the double line of the surface); if on
the line we have a series of points, and through the line a series of planes, corresponding
anharmonically to each other, and 8uch that to the double point considered as @ point of
the line, there corresponds the plane through one of the tangents at the double point, then
the line drawn through a point (of the double line), and in the corresponding plane, to
meet the cubic, generates the snrface. The special form in question must, however, have
