Probably, if wecould telescope
into a short distance a long relatively lax-leaved stem, such as that of Ankyropteris
scandens, or one of the individual axes composing the false stem of “ Clepsydropsis ”
australis, we should obtain not only the crowded leaf-arrangement seen in Astero-
chlenopsis, but also the supernumerary “ pith ’’-rays. But with the small fragment
of the stele available any attempt to ascertain the phyllotaxis seems hopeless. Another interesting fact about the leaf-trace sequence in the Kirgis fossil is the close
resemblance shown by the earliest stages with the corresponding parts in Zalesskya and
Thamnopteris. It will be remembered that it was in Thamnopteris schlechtendalit

* For a similar reason | think the characteristic form of the strand in “‘Clepsydropsis ” australis may also
be regarded as the “ permanent” one. Unfortunately it is only rarely that zygopterid petioles are
preserved in sufficient lengths to leave us without a feeling of insecurity on this point, which so closely
touches our specific and even generic distinctions.
