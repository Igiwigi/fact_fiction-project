Obviously with carbon and oxygen
you have the core electrons that are not up for grabs at all, and they really
restrict where it can go. Whereas with hydrogen, there is perhaps one
electron attached to it, but on the other hand it’s more like a deformation
of the electron cloud around it.

As such, you have much greater freedom over where you can put it :B
over anything that has core electrons associated with it. Although it Ss
does attract an electron, at the end of the day you are embedding a [8
proton in an electron gas, and you can stick that almost anywhere and it
can be embedded almost anywhere.
