In our opinion, we do not believe that the current state-of-the-art ML algorithms might
significantly outperform the human capability of detecting cardiac abnormalities. In fact, the
number of possible confounding factors, co-morbidities, number of rare conditions and evolution
in time of the diseases may all increase the amount of data necessary for ML models to be
trained. In order to mitigate such issues, the creation of innovative ML algorithms, capable of
incorporating the domain knowledge, would facilitate the development of these models (e.g.
less data-hungry algorithms, faster training, larger interpretability) and the introduction of such
methodologies in the clinical practice, thus fostering trust in their use.

a) Limitations of the study

The frameworks presented some limitations. First, rhythm-based cardiac abnormalities were
not properly handled by our methodology. Given the fact that an altered rhythm may or may
not affect the regularity of the occurrence of any waves, it was not possible to define the one-
to-one match between the cardiac abnormality and a specific ECG wave. For example, Brady

bradycardia), one of the class detected correctly by the network (recall of 0.53), refers to a


very low heart rate. Typically, heart-rate alterations are quantified looking at the time intervals
between consecutive R peaks because of their ease of detection. However, the frameworks found
the P-wave very important for this class (figure 2a). Given the fact that the P-wave does not
change during bradycardia, the assessment of the low heart rate might have been performed
by the network ‘looking’ at the rate of both P-wave and QRS complex. Similarly, the frameworks
found the T-wave relevant for the detection of AF (atrial fibrillation), which is characterized by the
