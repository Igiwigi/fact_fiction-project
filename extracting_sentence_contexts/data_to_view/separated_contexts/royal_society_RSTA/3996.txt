As an example, the electron should have a superpartner with the same mass. No such particle has been found and so SUSY is presumed to be a broken symmetry. SUSY also
has a richer Higgs boson sectorâ€”in fact there are five Higgs bosons in minimal SUSY models. For
the class of spectra illustrated in figure 4, the mass of the super-partners of the third generation of
quarks (stop and sbottom) is relatively low (approx. 500 GeV). It is the quantum loops of the top-
stop quarks that matter most in the above-mentioned problem meaning that the mass difference
(top - Mstop) has to be small.
