105th and 177th day respectively. The same was the case with the control
experiment. Thus, at the 94th day, when the last observation was made, the degree
of recovery was not markedly different from that present in the cases where the
crossing had been done, Two other important points were ascertained with reference
to these experiments. First, as to the excitability and condition of the cortical
representations of the affected muscles, it was found that they had not lost their
excitability, but, if anything, were more excitable, and that in the case of the crossing
experiments, they had interchanged their position, In one the flexion centre was
found where, normally, the extension centre should have been, and extension centre
where the flexion centre should have been, and in the other experiment the same was
also indicated. This agreed with the observations of CUNNINGHAM, and was opposed
to those of Sreranr. The second point was with reference to the comparison between
the experiments and the control, as “it was found that the fact of the divided nerves
being united in their old position without any crossing, did not result in a recovery of
function any sooner than in the experiments where nerve crossing had been done” (loc.
cit., p. 146) and “the course of restoration was not markedly different from that of the
cases in which the same nerves were divided and united in a crossing” (/oc. cit., p. 147).

In 1905 Kiivineron(8) published four experiments which were designed to
elucidate the conditions under which one group of cells in the central nervous
system normally associated with the supply of one of two antagonistic groups of
muscles could be induced to innervate both groups. This had been shown to be
possible in the case of the cell groups associated respectively with the spinal-accessory
and the facial nerves, in the case of spino-facial anastomosis, which I published in
1900, along with the research referred to above. Krivineron, however, investigated
