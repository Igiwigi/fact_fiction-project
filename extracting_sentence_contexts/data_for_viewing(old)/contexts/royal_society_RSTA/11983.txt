we can only consider the time average of this current, and that is most convenien Y
represented as the magnetic polarity of the molecule ; the displacement current in
dielectric above mentioned involves a similar process of averaging with respect

There is also the current of convection of electrons which rearranges the
etrie charge of a conductor. Of this last practically nothing is known ; the subject
wholly eluded experimental enquiry, except in the case of electrolytes, where the
odern theories of solution and electrolysis, in the hands of Hrrrorr, Kontrauscn,
(RRHENTUS, and Nernst, have yielded at any rate the first approximation to an
nalytical theory, As a matter of fact, the empirical and variable character of con-
ctivity as depending on physical state, and its overwhelming importance as
ompared with the other phenomena in conductors of metallic type, restriets within
arrow limits the problems in which a knowledge of their relations of convection and
larization would be of practical import.
Finally, there is one case in which an experimentally recognized result in the
vedium involves the dynamics of the molecule ; when the magnetic field is increased
he orbital motions in the molecule are altered so as to oppose the change, and this
induced alteration in the molecular current constitutes diamagnetism.
8. In the face of all these various types of motion of electrons that have to be taken
i to account, there are two distinct modes of procedure open to us; and they have
oth been used by MaxweEt1, without perhaps that sharp demarcation between
sentially different methods which is necessary to the perfect grasp of either of them.
