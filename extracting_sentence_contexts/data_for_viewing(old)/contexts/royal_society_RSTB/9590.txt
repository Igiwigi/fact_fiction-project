on tenures allowing agricultural expansion avoided loss but
was outweighed by unavoidable loss on those same tenures,
but the impact of that small conservation intervention could
be larger than in the previous case.

(c) Are policy, planning and management directed to
means or ends?

One limitation of conceptualizing policy targets and oper-
ational objectives with the results chain (figure 1a) is that
maximizing achievement at one step will not necessarily
maximize achievement at subsequent ones and might, in
fact, compromise them. Maximizing outputs as protected-
area extent, for example, will not necessarily maximize
outcomes for threat levels or state of biodiversity. This
point might seem obvious, but is not reflected in the current
focus of quantitative policy targets on outputs [17], the preoc-
cupation of systematic conservation planning with sampling
outcomes [18] and the scant attention given to impacts in
measures of protected-area management effectiveness [19,65].

The results chain is limited, however, in a more fundamen-
tal way: it provides no roadmap to maximizing impact. In ยง2b,
we showed that the measures in the results chain of figure 1a,
from inputs to outputs and three types of outcomes, can be
