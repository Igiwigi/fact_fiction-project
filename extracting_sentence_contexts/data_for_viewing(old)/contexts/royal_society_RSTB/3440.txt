experiment also illustrates a phenomenon which we have observed in many experi-
ments, namely, that a first dose produces a relatively greater effect on blood-pressure
and pulse rate than is produced by even a considerably larger second or subsequent
dose. A similar result was obtained by Marvy in his experiments with Pseudechis
venom.

A point of great interest is the effect, or rather the absence of effect, on the
respirations. The first four injections, involving a total of over 0Â°006 grm. per
kilogramme, produced practically no effect on the respirations. Failure of respiration
did not occur until after injection of the last dose, when the blood-pressure had
fallen to below 30 mm. of mercury, at which time impairment of respiration was
adequately explained by the great fall of blood-pressure. This is a corroboration of
the fact which we have previously emphasised, namely, that there is no evidence that
Echis venom contains a neurotoxin acting on the central nervous system.

The effects of this venom on blood-pressure offer a striking contrast to the effects
of Cobra and Sepedon venoms. In the case of the latter venoms the effects on
respiration are of primary importance, failure of the circulation being largely
consequent upon respiratory failure. In the case of Echis venom the reverse is true.
It follows from this, as we have found in several experiments, that artificial
respiration is quite ineffective in restoring the circulation in poisoning by Echis
venom, whereas in Sepedon venom poisoning* we have shown that a dose which will
arrest the respiration within half an hour has practically no effect on the blood-
pressure in three and a-half hours if artificial respiration be maintained.
