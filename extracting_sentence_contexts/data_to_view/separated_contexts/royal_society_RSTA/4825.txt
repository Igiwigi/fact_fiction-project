Figure 3a shows the ratio of the total shock heating
to the total Ohmic heating as a function of time. As 6x is decreased, the critical current threshold
rises (see equation (3.17)) and the opportunities for anomalous resistivity are much reduced. This
relationship outweighs the fact that better resolved currents are typically higher (figure 3b). What is significant about these results is that our attempts to maximize Ohmic dissipation by
using a locally defined current threshold have instead confirmed the dominance of shock heating. Between the 128? x 256 and 256* x 512 simulations, the shock heating increases by about 10%;
however, a further increase in spatial resolution leaves the level of shock heating more or less
