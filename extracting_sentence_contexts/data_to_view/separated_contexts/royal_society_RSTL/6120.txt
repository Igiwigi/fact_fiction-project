Communicated by Dr, A. W. HOPMANN. Received March 20,â€”Read May 3, 1860. Sus researches which I beg, in the following pages, to submit to the Royal Society,
v2embody the results obtained in the further development of an observation which I made
=a considerable number of years ago, and which, since that time, I had to defend against
=the objections of others, both by experimental inquiries of my own, and by the collection
Zand discussion of facts elicited in the investigations of other observers. As far back as
