RODGHR ON THE RELATIONS

dibromides, for although the curves for acetylene, ethylene, and isobutylene bromides
follow in the order of the molecular weights of the substances, that for propylene
bromide lise o the lage ietesd of the sight of the curve for ethylene bromide, Prom
enol data ns cnn be obtained on this point, the divergence is more probably due te the
difference ia symmetry between the structure of the molecules of ethylene and propylene
Iwomides than to any possible difference im the complexity of the liquid moleonlay
of these substances. Jb is significant that the euryes for substances of which the
nivlevgles contain two atoms of bromine bave such «a different shape from those of”
nionu-derivatives, Brontine tteelf, aa shown by the similarity of its curve to that of
acetylene bromide, behaves like u dibromide. This fact may be held to indiguty
the diatomic nature of its molecule. Chlorides. Four monochlorides were examined, yiz., isopropyl chloride, propyl chlovidy,
isobutyl chloride, and allyl chloride.
