The contradiction which exists between the results of the present research and the
interpretation given to their experiments by Mrescuer and WoroscuitorF is brought
into the strongest prominence by the consideration of the present group of results. If
the interpretation of these physiologists is warranted by their data, and is of general
application, then we should expect that the integrity or otherwise of the lateral column
opposite the entry of astimulated nerve would have the preponderating influence upon
the passage of those nerve impulses which haye entered the cord by the nerve, and
consequently upon the amount of the electrical change in the observed portion of cord. We have, however, already accounted for 95 per cent. of the effect by showing that
the amount is dependent upon the integrity of the other columns, and this fact alone
is sufficient to show what a small share the integrity of the opposite lateral column
has in providing channels for the conduction of ascending impulses. We have made experiments upon five different animals, the results being separated
into those in which the lateral column was divided on the opposite side to the
nerve, and those in which all structures, except the opposite lateral column, were
cut

At will be noticed that in only one case (346) was there any marked reduction, and
Ht this did not occur when the intensity of the stimulus was increased.
