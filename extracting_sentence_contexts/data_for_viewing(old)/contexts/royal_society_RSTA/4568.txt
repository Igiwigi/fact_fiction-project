industry executives realized that they could compete with the body of fact that was emerging 5
from scientific research by insisting that the science was not yet settled—in effect, by putting ‘the 1B
body of fact’ in scare quotes—and so it would be wrong, or at least premature, to restrict customer : wu

Scholars including Allan Brandt, Robert Proctor, Sharon Eubanks, Stanton Glantz and Lisa : w

more than half a century, the tobacco industry deliberately delayed and diluted efforts to [&

that demonstrates its harms (harms that include diverse cancers, heart disease, various forms
