directly. The difficulty, however, is surmounted by obtaining successively values
with increasing accuracy from other considerations until the final test can be applied.
As a fact the Ne oun is amongst the most accurate found. Its determination (p. 461)
is specially interesting, and indeed is only possible because the material at disposal
depends on interferential measures and large accurately known separations. That
of X also is a good determination, and is interesting as depending on a number of
quite independent data.

As the oun is proportional to the square of the atomic weight within the limits of
error of determination of the latter, it is natural to assume that the relation is exact
and that d = g.w’, where q is a number between 361'°8+'1. If this were sustained it
would be possible to obtain w with twice the degree of accuracy of the oun and
therefore far in advance of any obtainable by chemical methods. In fact the question
is raised as to what is actually understood by the atomic weight. Does it refer to
the mass of the positive nucleus, or to that and all or a portion of the electrons ?
The hope might even be entertained of obtaining by this method some knowledge of
the number of electrons partaking in the emission of a line if slight changes in the
oun could be found. For instance, we shall find in these spectra not a single group
of 8, D, or F series as in are spectra, but several independent groups, viz., d and f
sequents, depending on different multiples of A, If these gave slightly different
values of the oun it could be explained by a transference of electrons. There is little
evidence of such variation, but it might occur, for instance, in the oun as deduced
respectively from A, and A, As A, depends alone on the measurement of the »
separation of a triplet it is not susceptible of such exact determination as A,, and, as
a fact, a suspicion sometimes arises that such a slight difference may exist, and that
