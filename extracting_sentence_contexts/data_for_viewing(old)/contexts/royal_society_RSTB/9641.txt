taxon samplings (sometimes the only way to avoid artefacts),
better gene samplings and clever data removal strategies,
have led to numerous revisions of the ToL, especially at an
intermediate evolutionary scale (e.g. within Metazoa
[17,18,61,62]). Strikingly, a major trend is visible in these
revised phylogenies: morphologically simple organisms,
once considered as akin to ancestral intermediates (‘living
fossils’) in a gradual rise towards complex organisms, are
often relocated within groups of complex organisms, thus
implying that their simplicity is not primitive but secondarily
