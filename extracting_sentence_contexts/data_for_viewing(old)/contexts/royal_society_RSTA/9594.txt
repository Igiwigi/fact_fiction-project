under the maximum pressure used, 900 Ibs. per sq. in. The bore of the valve is
is inch diameter and the passages are bell-mouthed on both sides. A plug formed
of rolled copper gauze serves to dissipate the kinetic energy of the jet issuing from
the valve. The time occupied in the passage from one thermo-junction to the other,
at the slowest rate of flow, was only a fraction of a second.

The thermo-junctions were connected to the selector switch (p. 85) in such a way
that the temperature of either junction, or the difference between the two, could be
measured, The latter arrangement was convenient, since it was the difference of
temperature which was being investigated.

Before using the new apparatus tests were made to ascertain whether the heat
insulation was in fact perfect, and also what difference, if any, there was between the
readings of temperature given by the two thermo-junctions. The construction of the
apparatus makes these tests very simple.

To avoid the slightest drop of pressure between the thermo-junctions, a simple full-
bore block of vuleanite (also shown in fig. 16) was substituted for the adjustable valve,
then liquid CO, was passed through the apparatus, first with the thermo-junctions in
their normal positions, and again when the thermo-junctions had been interchanged,
end for end. The apparent difference of temperature between the thermo-junctions
in the first case represents the sum, and in the second case, the difference, of the two
quantities to be determined, viz., the actual change of temperature of the liquid and
the difference of the thermo-junctions.
