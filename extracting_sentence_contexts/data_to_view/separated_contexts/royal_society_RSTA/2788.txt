The cooling
rate of approximately 100K Gyr™! is also consistent with the secular decrease in oceanic crust
thickness [176] and seems necessary to explain the observed rate of seafloor subsidence [161]. In contrast to the long-held belief in faster convection for a hotter mantle, supporting
geological records have been lacking for decades [177-179]. As a matter of fact, recent studies
suggest that plate motion may have been even slightly slower in the past, based on the lifespan
of passive margins [96] and continental reconstruction [98,99]. Such slower plate motion in the
past is consistent with a constant surface heat flux through time (figure 9b); plate velocity, U and
surface heat flux, Q, are related as Qa AT¥VU, where AT is the temperature contrast between
surface and the interior [180], so when Q is constant, U should decrease as AT increases. It
