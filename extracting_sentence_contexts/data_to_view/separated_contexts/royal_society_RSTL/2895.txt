Thus in the observations on Sphinz Elpenor,
Lixx., which was fasting during nearly the whole of the period of observation, twenty-
two hours, the insect lost only *85 of a grain of fecal expenditure, but 2:45 of grains
by the respiratory and cutaneous surfaces, and of this expenditure, when the insect
was lying at rest, only 05 of a grain per hour, but when in violent motion the loss
amounted to *15 per hour. This difference of quantity is readily accounted for by
the quicker circulation of the fluids in the active state of the insect, when its respira-
tion is greater, and consequently a greater amount of heat is generated, and requires
to be regulated by the transpiration from the surface of the body. This Table also
indicates the fact that the whole process of digestion may be completed in the larya
of the Sphinx in about two hours and a half, and that the average quantity of fecal
expenditure in the latter period of a moderate sized larva is about one grain per hour. But the connection or correspondence between the quantity of respiration, tempe-
rature and gaseous expenditure in a given time, is beautifully illustrated in what oc-
curs in the pupa state. On the 3rd of April, 1836, I weighed several pup of Sphinv
ligustri, and found that one of them which on the 20th of the preceding August, im-

mediately after it had changed to a pupa, weighed 71'1 grains, had not expended,
during the long interval of nearly eight months, or two hundred and twenty-eight days
inclusive, more than 3-7 grains in weight, the whole of which must have passed off
from the respiratory and cutaneous surfaces, This was the identical specimen which I
