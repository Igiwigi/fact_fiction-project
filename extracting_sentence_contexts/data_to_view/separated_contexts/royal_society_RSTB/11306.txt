This important negative result is worth exploring. The
FET model highlights findings in neurochemistry, suggesting
that DA systems prioritize and update behavioural pro-
grammes, whereas 5-HT maintains the available alternatives. In fact, Netter’s [25] studies of the reaction time (i.e. timing of
integration of actions) reported a slow-down universally in
both extra- and introverts when a DA antagonist is used. Moreover, when only DA (and not 5-HT) systems were
compromised in experiments of Robbins [23], Netter [25] and
Dellu-Hagedorn et al. [26], an individual could not prioritize be-
havioural alternatives into situation-adequate actions, but still
was able to maintain previous sets of programmes; this results
in rigidity and perseveration around the same acts. When a
deficiency in 5-HT was added to disturbances in DA release,
a low turn-over of the DA led to high impulsivity [23,26].
