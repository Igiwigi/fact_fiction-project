SOME OF THE ANIMALS FED AND SLAUGHTERED AS HUMAN FOOD. 547

food consumed by this single fattening Pig, there were produced 14-94 parts of dry
? - gubstance of increase. Of these 14:94 parts of total dry increase, 13:2 were fat, 1:62
| 'nitrogenous compounds, and 0:11 mineral matter. Against these numbers we have.
aking the average of all the other estimates (twenty-four in number, and comprising
80 animals), 17-27 total dry increase for 100 of dry food ; of which 15:81 are exti-
mated as fat, 1-44 nitrogenous substance, and an insignificant amount of mineral matter.
It is admitted that the estimates in Table XIV. relating to the Sheep, show a higher
proportion of mineral to other constituents, stored up, than was probably the fact. On
the other hand, the estimates of assimilated mineral matter in the case of the Pigs are
probably in error in the other direction. It is true, that Pigs, though young, if put upon
Shighly fattening food will grow comparatively little in frame, whilst Sheep, fed as they
anow generally are at a comparatively early age, will develop more of hard bony struc-
Sture. It would be expected, therefore, that the proportion of mineral matter in the
Jinerease of fattening Sheep would be greater than that in fattening Pigs. Indeed, Table
Sy shows the percentage of mineral matter, in the total carcasses, to be more than
ice as much in the fattened Sheep analysed, as in the fat Pig. Tn the case of both
SSheep and Oxen moreover, there seems to be a striking paralleligm in the proportion of
'She mineral to the nitrogenous matters of growth ; whilst with the Pig, not only is the
= amount of mineral matter much less, but its proportion to the nitrogenous matters
"Seems to decrease as the animals fatten. Thus, looking to the composition of the car-
