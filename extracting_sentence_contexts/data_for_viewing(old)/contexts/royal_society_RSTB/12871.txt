seems extraordinary because the twig is no longer attached to
the branch, and especially the sounds likewise serve no func-
tion in pillow formation per se. And so, orang-utan surplus
nest-making procedures are currently resisting an ordinary
explanation and might therefore create symbolic meaning.

Yet, these orang-utan nest sounds may also be too soft to
serve as a communicative function to others, unless these
others are nearby (but then they can actually see that the sub-
ject is finishing a nest).'* At two well-studied sites, all
individuals studied virtually always perform these sounds
when they build their big evening nest, regardless of whether
they are in association with infants or others [50]. The fact
that these behaviours seemingly are performed primarily
individualistically, i.e. without a social goal, fails to support
the view that the sound is symbolic (unless we would allow
for private symbols; more on this below).

5. Discussion

Even when a specifically derived, stripped-down, minimal (ape)
ritual definition is applied, there is as yet no clear, unequivocal,
full-blown evidence for any spontaneous minimal ritual in non-
enculturated, untrained apes. Furthermore, even the single
necessary core components of the minimal ritual definition,
