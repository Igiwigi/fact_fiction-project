activity, My results in this connexion differ from those of Dr. BowpiTcn in that (Â«) the
medusoid tissue has a shorter memory for the occurrence of a previous stimulation than
has the cardiac; and (6) in the medusoid tissue a stimulus which at the bottom of a stair-

case is of less than minimal intensity, is able at the top of a staircase to give rise to a
contraction of very nearly maximum intensity. This latter fact proves that the stair-
case action is, at any rate in part, dependent on the process of stimulation as distin-
guished from that of contraction. Moreover, that the effect is one pervading the
whole extent of the irritable tisses, is proved by another fact, viz. that when at any
stage during the construction of a staircase the electrodes are snddenly shifted to any
other part of the irritable tissues, the next contraction will rank as the next step in
the staircase. Other experiments have conclusively proved that the staircase action |
obtains in the case of the natural ganglionic stimulation in exactly the same way, both
quantitatively and qualitatively, as it does in the case of artificial stimulation.

The excitable tissues of Aurelia may be thrown into tetanus by means of strong
faradaic stimulation. That the tetanus is due to 8ummation of contractions may be proved
by throwing in single shocks at one end of a spiral strip with a key, and observing that
if the shocks are thrown in with a certain rapidity, the resulting contractile waves overlap
one another, 80 giving rise to persistent spasm. In such experiments, however long the
strip may be, and however complicated the time relations between successive stimuli are
