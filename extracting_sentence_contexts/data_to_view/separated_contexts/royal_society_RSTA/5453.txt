Such well-structured definitions
can be realized in the form of ontologies, ie. formalized knowledge bases. Gruber [13]
defines an ontology as an ‘explicit specification of a conceptualization’. While an ontology’s
terminological component (TBox) describes facts about the notions included, its assertional
component (ABox) describes the instance level. Different kinds of ontologies, namely application
ontologies, reference ontologies and top-level ontologies, should be distinguished [14]. Application ontologies rely on specific universals and particulars in combination with inference
mechanisms for executing some specific task [15].
