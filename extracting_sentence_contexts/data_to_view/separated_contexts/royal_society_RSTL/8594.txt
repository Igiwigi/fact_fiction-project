Though these
structures disappear in some eggs, it cannot be asserted that they may not be persistent
in others. One point of interest in this and other eggs figured on the Plate is the
presence of the membranous envelope to the egg, which was not found by either LeypiG
or SCHMIDT in their studies on Cyclas. This fact has been especially insisted upon with regard to Cyclas, and it is therefore
important to note the presence of the envelope in Pisidium, It is very delicate, and is
ruptured and discarded after the first stages of development. Plate 1. fig. 15 shows a similar egg in its enyelope; in this egg two nucleoli are
present in the nucleus (? germinal spots and vesicle). Plate 1. fig. 16 gives a surface-view of the first pair of cleayage-grooves.
