plicable to the sanguiniferous system. It would, I think, be out of place to enter fully
Jnto this discussion on the present occasion, but my own experience with the frog leaves
Si doubt in my mind that in that animal contractions of the heart are the only cause of
Jhe circulation. I will content myself with mentioning two observations bearing upon
question. The first of these has reference to certain movements which occur for a
Zonsiderable time after cessation of the heart's action, and which, though of trivial and
Spncertain character, have had much stress laid upon them in this discussion. IT have
Scortained by observations made in several different cases, that they are produced by
.Secasional spontaneous contractions and relaxations of the arteries. These changes in
e calibre of the vessels continue, even in an amputated limb, for days after severance
m the body*: I have repeatedly watched them taking place, and seen them give rise
the movement of the blood.
'B The other fact to which I will allude, appears to me to decide of itself the question at
JZ88ue. Having occasion to examine, under chloroform, some very small frogs, measuring
Mbout an inch from the tip of the nose to the end of the coccyx, I found that the blood
Jn the capillaries invariably flowed in a stream pulsating synchronously with the beats
Ef the heart, which were visible through the parietes of the thorax ; and however mildly
She anzesthetic was administered, the motion was commonly exceedingly slight between
She pulses. Not unfrequently, although the arteries remained of full size, the blood
moved in jerks, with considerable intervals of absolute stillness between the successive
Zimpulses which the contractions of the heart occasioned ; yet no accumulation of cor-
Epuscles was produced in the capillaries, however long the animal was kept under obser-
Avation. Had any other cause of motion than the action of the heart operated upon the
blood, there must have been a continuous flow, however much accelerated at each pulse ;
tor I must add, that there was nothing whatever of recoil after each onward movement,
