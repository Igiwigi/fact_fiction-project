much greater extent and occurring in every vessel. They are both modifications
of fibro-yascular tissue, and have no relationship to the discigerous fibres of the

'Thongh my sections of the Burntisland plant are numerous, all the fragments have
been short ones, and I haye not been fortunate enough to meet with one exhibiting
clearly a nodal foliiferous disk with as8ociated leaves. One 8mall and crushed twig,
however, appears in one of my slides, which I do not doubt is of this character ; but
it is too distorted by pressure for me to make much use of it. It appears to me that
this species has been characterized by very long internodes.

Attention has been directed to the fact that, amongst the Oldham specimens, I have

(z) projecting through the bark from the exogenous vascular lamine which radiate from
one arm of the central triangle. Tt appears as if most of the s8mall vessels of one of
the three segments radiating from these several angles were more or less deflected into
