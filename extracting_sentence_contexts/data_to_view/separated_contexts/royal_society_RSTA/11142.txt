Moreover, nuclei, which require such a large degree of supersaturation of
water vapour before it can condense upon them, have never been found to persist for
more than a few seconds; while in A1rkENâ€™s experiments the exposure to the sunlight
was made at an open window and the apparatus then removed to a dark room before
the expansion was made. Although in these sunlight experiments no nuclei, requiring only slight super-
saturation to make condensation take place on them, have been produced, they do not

absolutely prove that such nuclei may not be formed by sunlight even in the lower
layers of the atmosphere. For it is quite possible that the disappearance of the
nuclei produced by weak ultra-violet light, when they are left to themselves, is
entirely due to the fact that they very quickly reach the walls of the vessel by
diffusion on account of their small size. The time for which they persist would then
entirely depend on the size of the vessel containing them. Now the explanation of
the fact, that with weak radiation they never grow sufficiently to be caught by slight
expansions, may simply be that they reach the walls before any considerable growth
has time to take place.
