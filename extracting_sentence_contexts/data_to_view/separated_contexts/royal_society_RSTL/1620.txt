It has not been discovered (with
any degree of certainty ), why they fix upon the 15th degree
of Aquarius as a rule for regulating the commencement of
their lunar year : but they have an annual festival about the

recurrence of this period z + which bears a consider-

able resemblance to the deification of the bull Apis ; and
this resemblance is increased by the connection of both cere-
monies with the labours of agriculture, and with the hopes of
an abundant season.- This coincidence may serve to fortify
the opinions of those who are fond of tracing the Chinese to
the Egyptians ; although the possibility of such a derivation
has been ably disproved by M. pe Pauw. * I call this intercalation triennial, because that is the nearest approximation ;

but in fact it is seyen times in nineteen years. + For a detail of the Chinese ceremony, vide Moxn180N's view of China, p. 109.
