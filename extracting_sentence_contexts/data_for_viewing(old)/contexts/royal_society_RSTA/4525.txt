This picture changes for the higher generations, mainly because of the presence of the disc
with the second largest radius in the central part of the packing. This disc alters the flow pattern
in different ways for different values of s and v. The dependence of Bz as function of v is
characterized by large variations for all values of s, some of which with opposite tendencies.
Fluctuations in the behaviour of B73 are enhanced, since it results from oil stacked within the
small channels as well as in the region behind the large circles zone Z3.

Despite the large fluctuations in the values of Bz and B23 with respect to v, an overall general
tendency is the increase in the fraction of retained oil as the value of s increases. Although this
aspect becomes more evident for B23, it can also be detected in the case of Bz. This corresponds
to the reported behaviour in other previous studies and the overall known resistance to remove a
fluid from dense packing and media with small porosity. The larger differences between Bz and
By3 when the value of s increases is explained by the fact that the amount of oil O3 is less sensitive
to variations in the value of s than O2 and Ap.

It is important to note that the two different measures can guide expected results for other
packing arrangements that can be built in similar way. If the whole channel is filled with discs,
one should expect the value of Bz as a good approximation. However, for inhomogeneous
packing, where regions with obstacles and obstacle-free alternate, Bz 3 should provide a better


approximation for the fraction of retained oil. This is useful when one compares the dependency
of these measures as function of v as well as for the analysis of the dependency with respect to
the porosity, that is carried out in the following subsection.
