true thermodynamic seale by means of CALLENDAR’s formula,

0° C. = 0,48 (t/100—1). ¢/100 with 3 = 1°54.

Actual calculation of temperatures was avoided by the use of the conversion tables
given by Burgess and Le Cuarecrer (*) calculated for 6 = 1°50. From an auxiliary
table the temperature correction for a value of } other than this value is given; it is
seen that the correction A@ for Ad = 0°01 is A@ = 0'9° C. at @ = 1000° C., showing
that the value of 3 can vary considerably without altering the value of @ to an extent
greater than the limit of accuracy of the other measurements.

No attempt was made to work with the wires at a higher temperature than 1200° C.
owing to the fact that the use of CALLENDAR’s formula beyond this point is subject to
uncertainty (*) ; also at high temperatures the wires soften and are liable to break
when driven through the air at the high velocities.
