reappearing in the cilia, and it continued to increase during the next seven minutes, at the
end of which time it was again almost universal. At 9* 52m the cold water was drawn
off, and the same condition of the cilia having been ascertained to exist, the trough was,
at 9* 52" 27%, filled up again with water at 104 Fau. ; eighteen seconds after this had
been done, the ciliary action was found much diminished, but had not fully ceased ; and
after nine seconds more, during which the warm water was drawn off, the cilia were till
acting very lightly. Within twenty-three seconds of this time the trough was again
filled with cold water: now, however, the epithelium was in many parts beginning to
exfoliate, swelling up by endosmose in obedience to the ordinary laws of chemical
affinity, and 0 indicating that it was losing its vitality. T also lost sight of the precise
8pot which I had been observing, but noticed that ciliary action was again going on pretty
quickly in some places. There can be no doubt, although there was no opportunity for
observing the fact, that the first immersion in hot water caused cessation of the ciliary
action; and that being admitted, we have in this case suspension of function and recovery
four times repeated in the same fragment of tissue in consequence of as many applications
and withdrawals of the irritant. It is a curious cireumstance that each recovery, except
the final one, brought up the action of the cilia for a time to a better state than they
had just before the last introduction of warm water. But the discussion of this and
other circumstances in this case will be best reserved till after the mention of another
et of experiments.

In order to eliminate the nerves completely from among the causes both of the suspen-
8ion of tunction produced by irritants and the recovery from that state, it seemed de-
sirable, if possible, to observe those occurrences in detached epithelium-cells, and on the
22nd of January 1859 I made the attempt to do 80. At first, however, it proved more
