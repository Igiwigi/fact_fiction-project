the Right Honourable the Earl of MorTon, F. R. S. in a Letter
addressed to the President. Read November 2, 1820: My Dea Stn, *

T ersrenpay had an opportunity of observing a singular
fact in Natural History, which you may perhaps deem not
unworthy of being communicated to the Royal Society,
Some years ago, I was desirous of trying the experiment
of domesticating the Quagga, and endeavoured to procure
some individuals of that species. I obtained a male; but
being disappointed of a female, I tried to breed from the
male quagga and a young chesnut mare of seven-eighths
Arabian blood, and which had never been bred from : the
result was the production of a female hybrid, now five
years old, and bearing, both in her form and in her colour,
very decided indications of her mixed origin, I subsequently
. parted with the seven-eighths Arabian mare to Sir Got
OvsELEY, who has bred from her by a very fine black Ara-
bian horse, I yesterday morning examined the produce,
namely, a - two-years old filly, and a year-old colt.
