The ammonium and sodium bivanadates were found to
correspond with the formulze N H, O.2V O, and Na O 2V O,, where V=68-5 and O=8. If we aswme V=51-3 and O=16, these salts will be expressed by the formulas
(NH,), V, On and Na, V, O41; or they may be represented as anhydro-salts, either
2(NH,V O,)+V,O; and 2(Na V O,)+V, O;, or else as Na, V, 0;+3(V,0,) as an
anhydro-salt of sodium pyro-vanadate. Constitution of the Normal Vanadates.—That vanadic acid in its normal state is tri-
basic is shown by the fact first pointed out by CzupxowiczF, that when vanadium pent-
oxide is fused with an excess of sodium carbonate three molecules of carbon dioxide
(3C O,) are displaced for eyery molecule of vanadium pentoxide (V, O,) entering into
combination. In an experiment carefully conducted, in which sodium carbonate was
heated to redness with 04323 grm. of vanadium pentoxide until no further loss of
weight occurred, the pentoxide was found to expel 0-3078 grm. carbon dioxide (C O,);
this corresponds to a ratio of 2:957 molecules of carbon dioxide to 1 of V, O;, or nearly

in the proportion of 3 tofl. Normal- or ortho-s0dium yanadate is Na, V O,, or _ O..
