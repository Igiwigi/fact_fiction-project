behind the glabella (g2). If these relations be compared in the form of ratios repre-
senting the proportion of the glabella-bregma length to bregyma-LFB \ength, the respective
indices are as follows : Sinanthropus, 64-0; Pithecanthropus, 52-0.

Similarly, if the positions of ewl and eu2 be compared, itis found that in Sinanthropus
(bl-op1 length = 110 mm.) the ewl lies 26 mm. behind the plane 61, while in Pithe-
canthropus (b2-op2 length = 104 mm.) the ew2 falls 44-5 mm. caudal of 62. If these
relations be compared as indices the following values emerge : Sinan-
thropus, 23-6; Pithecanthropus, 42-8.

The foregoing facts serve to demonstrate that, aside from those of absolute size and
vault contour, some very significant differences in general proportions also obtain between
these two skulls, although they are in many other respects so similar.
