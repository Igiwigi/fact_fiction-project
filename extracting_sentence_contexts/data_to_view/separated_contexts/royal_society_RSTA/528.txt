Let us use @ as independent variable in equations of motion (18-9). The fifth equation gives at once that w’ is of the second order. Noting that x,, /,; %,
are usually negligible; and taking into account the fact that usually, for normal con-
dition, x,,/kps Yolk are of zero order, while z,,/kp, Z,/ky are of order —1; then since v’
is small, while w’ is of the second order, we at once deduce that the first three equations

of (18-9) give
