the other from the left thalamus nervorum opticorum. [

According to this supposition, decussation will take place
only between the adjacent halves of the two nerves. That
portion of nerve which proceeds from the right thalamus to
the right side of the right eye, passes-to- its destination with-
out interference ; and in a similar manner the left thalamus
will supply the left side of the left eye with one part of its
fibres, while the remaining halves of both nerves in passing
over to the eyes of the opposite sides must. intersect each
other, either with or without intermixture of their fibres.

Now, if we consider rightly the facts discovered by com-


of the optic nerves. 227

parative anatomy in fishes, we shall find that the crossing
of the entire nerves in them to the opposite eyes, is in perfect
conformity to this view of the arrangement of the human
optic nerves. The relative position of the eyes to each other
in the sturgeon, is s0 exactly back to back, on opposite sides
of the head, that they can hardly see the same object; they
can have no points which generally receive the same impres-
Sions as'in us; there are no corresponding points of vision
