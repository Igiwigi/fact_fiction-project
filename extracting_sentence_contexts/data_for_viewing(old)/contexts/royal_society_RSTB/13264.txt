tracked at two different time points: worms that had been
removed from Nigericin and were put in water for one week
(one week washout), worms that had been removed from
Nigericin 3 weeks prior to DiBAC imaging (three week wash-
out), and a wild-type control group that had never been
drug-treated. Both of the Nigericin-treated groups were signifi-
cantly depolarized relative to controls (**p<0.01 Student's
T-test), while there were no significant differences between
the treated samples. Note also that the altered pattern gets
stronger between one and three weeks (with no further treat-
ment), as discussed above in the context of consolidation and
construction of memories in the brain. These data reveal the
remarkable fact that very brief alterations of bioelectric mech-
anics are remembered by tissue as long-term stable
alterations in resting membrane potential in planaria.

10. Conclusion

Regeneration highlights numerous aspects of robust control that
are challenging to explain via purely molecular-genetic path-
way paradigms. These include: the ability of cellular systems
to coordinate activity across large distances, to process spatial
information at multiple scales (including those much bigger
than single cells), to integrate stochastic and noisy behaviour
of micro-agents into organ-level decisions, to store ‘potential’,
