3 Tt will be observed, on comparing these results with those obtained in 1875,* that
the neutral point here is between 8 mm. and 3 mm., whereas in the former case it
S\was between 0°8 mm. and 0:3 mm, TI, however, attach little importance to this, as
the older apparatus was much more sensitive than the one now used.t The important
#fact is that in each case the direction changes at a high exhaustion, and then the
= movement becomes five times as strong as it was originally.

& The motive force producing these rotations is, at high exhaustions, the molecular
g impacts between adjacent surfaces of the suspended cylinders excited by the radiation
€ falling on them from the hot water, hot spiral, or a candle (which is equally effective). g
