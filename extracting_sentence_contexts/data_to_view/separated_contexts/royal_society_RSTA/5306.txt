Storing 1MWh in a tank of molten salt with a
temperature jump of 200°C requires 6 m°of salts. Even if an overall thermal efficiency of 50 per
cent is assumed, the size is 12m> MWh7!. This fact changes the perspective for CSP because it
can generate electricity with a sound capability to stabilize a futuristic electric system with a high
share of renewable energy sources. Of course, this opportunity will be restricted to locations with high levels of direct solar
radiation, typically deserts, which are very far from the high consumption zones of central and
northern Europe. This implies the need to send electricity along several thousand kilometres, but
this is a challenge that could be answered with an adequate effort on superconductivity, although
other alternatives based on high-voltage DC transmission lines must also be taken into account.
