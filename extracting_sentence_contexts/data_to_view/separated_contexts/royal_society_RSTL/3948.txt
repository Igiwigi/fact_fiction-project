Such a bath will easily continue for twenty or thirty minutes, retaining solid carbonic
acid the whole time ; and the glass tubes used would sustain sndden immersion in it
without breaking. But as my hopes of any success beyond that heretofore obtained depended more
upon depression of temperature than on the pressure which I could employ in these
tubes, I endeavoured to obtain a still greater degree of cold. There are, in fact,
Some results producible by cold which no pressure may be able to effect. 'Phus,

which comes on with liquids at a certain heat, may have its point of temperature for
some of the bodies to be experimented with, as oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, &e., below
that belonging to the bath of carbonic acid and ether ; and, in that case, no pressure
which any apparatus could bear would be able to bring them into the liquid or solid
state. To procure this lower degree of cold, the bath of carbonic acid and ether was put
into an air-pump, and the air and gaseous carbonic acid rapidly removed.
