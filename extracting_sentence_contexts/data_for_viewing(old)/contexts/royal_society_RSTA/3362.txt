— mutations improving sequence i as a template for replication catalysed by sequence i — 1;
— mutations improving sequence i as a catalyst replicating sequence i + 1.

The former increases the replication rate of a mutant. Thus, the mutant can spread through a
population. By contrast, the latter increases the replication rate of sequence i+ 1, but not of
a mutant itself. Thus, the mutant is not selected (i.e. selectively neutral). To sum up: selection
favours better templates, but is indifferent to better catalysts [20]. Therefore, if a mutant appears
that serves as a better template, but provides no catalysis, it will out-compete the wild-type
providing catalysis and thereby drive the entire hypercycle to extinction. That is, the hypercycle
is unstable against the invasion of ‘parasites’ (see also [21,22]).

The situation is actually even worse: if one takes into account the fact that replication consumes
a finite amount of time, it can be shown that sequences providing catalysis are at a selective
disadvantage rather than being selectively neutral [23]. Thus, selection favours better templates,
but acts against better catalysts.

The pioneering work of Eigen and Schuster, combined with the fundamental issue raised by
Maynard Smith, has set a specific agenda for research on the origin of life: assume a system of
replicating molecules that compete and interact with each other, and investigate what conditions
are required for the system to have a potential to evolve into life as we know it. It is not the
purpose of this opinion piece to review the studies done since the above pioneering work,
for which the reader is referred to the reviews [15,16,24-27]. Here, we only touch on our own
recent work in order to connect the above discussion to ongoing experimental work on synthetic
protocells.
