Remark 1.2. This theorem extends a result proven in [18] in that it pins down an appropriate
function space for our analysis and, within that function space, establishes uniqueness of a
minimizer. That uniqueness, in turn, yields a weak stability result, as it shows that it would be
inconsistent for any perturbation preserving the function space to have a growth rate that is non-
negative. Preliminary calculations indicate that in fact a strong stability result should hold here;
ie. that for any value of || < 1, there exists c > 0, depending on yz, such that the infimum of the
decay rate magnitudes of perturbations preserving the space is bounded below by c. However,
this remains to be rigorously established by a complete analysis of the Hessian for the RCN
variational problem.

The second part of §3 discusses how to reconcile this stability result with the presence of
an instability in grain boundaries of the SH equation. Specifically, it reviews recent results on
minimizers of the RCN equation when phase gradients are not vector fields.

Section 4 revisits the numerical simulations of §2 in the light of the results of §3 and proposes a
new class of boundary conditions for potential minimizers of the RCN equation. It also places the
latter equation in the perspective of a hierarchy of variational problems whose solutions increase
