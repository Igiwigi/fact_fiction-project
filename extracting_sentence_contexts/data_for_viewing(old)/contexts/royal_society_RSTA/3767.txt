(b) Thrust and power in the presence of secondary flows

As in the previous section, the thrust and power potential of wind flows over these heterogeneous
terrains can be derived from contours of U* and US across the flow. Figure 9 shows contours
of both quantities for three different surface terrains (different spacings between streamwise-
aligned roughness). It can be clearly seen, just as in the previous case, that different terrains
exhibit different thrust and power potential. There is a remarkable difference between the hills
and valleys even within the cases examined here (three out of the five presented in figure 8). For
low spacing between hills (S/5 = 0.29), the variation in thrust and power appears to be negligible.
As the spacing is increased to $/5 = 0.89, the variation in thrust and power potential becomes
significant and follows (in fact, accentuates) the secondary flow arrangement found in the mean
flow. For even higher spacing (S/5 = 1.74), the variation between hill and valley is reduced, owing
to the presence of tertiary flows. For example, at a height of 0.25 above the surface (assuming a
turbine with hub height at this location), the differences in thrust and power between peak and
valley are negligible for S/5 =0.3. At the same height, these differences increase to over 60% for
S/5 =0.89. For the highest spacing case, the differences are reduced to just around 30%. However,
