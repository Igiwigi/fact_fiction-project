anomalies which owe their origin to peculiarities of aggregation are indeed manifold,
and constitute one of the most important subjects of study which can engage the
attention of the natural philosopher.

Organie structures furnish an ample field for inquiries into molecular action. For
here, as before remarked, nature, to attain her special ends, has arranged her mate-
rials in a particular manner. To ascertain what effect the molecular structure of wood
has upon the transmission of heat through it, constitutes the object of the first part of
this investigation.

Upwards of twenty years ago MM. Ds 1a Rivs and DzCanporre instituted an
inquiry into the conductive power of wood*, and in the case of five specimens
examined established the fact of the feeble conductivity of the substance, and also
that the velocity of transmission was greater along the fibre than across it. The
manner of experiment was that usually adopted in inquiries of this nature, and ap-
plied to metals by M. DeereTz4+. A bar of the substance was taken, one end of
which was brought into contact with a source of heat and allowed to remain 80 until
a stationary temperature was assumed. The temperatures attained by the bar, at
various distances from its heated end, were ascertained by means of thermometers
fitting into cavities made to receive them; from these data, with the aid of a well-
known formula, the conductivity of the wood was determined. Since the publication
of their results by the distinguished men above mentioned, nothing, 80 far as I am
aware of, has been done in connexion with this subject.

The mode of experiment here indicated is, however, by no means sufficiently deli-
