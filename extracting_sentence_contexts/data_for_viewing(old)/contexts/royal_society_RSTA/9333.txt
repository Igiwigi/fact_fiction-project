noticed that the @-phase is just beginning to appear. After the same stretched and dried
hair had been immersed for 8 minutes in a 1 per cent. aqueous solution of Na,S . 9H,0,
then washed for half an hour with water and finally dried, the photograph shown in

94 W. T. ASTBURY AND A. STREET ON X-RAY STUDIES OF

fig. 6B was obtained. It shows a remarkable increase in the development of the
6-phase.* Further trials proved that the effect may be observed after even shorter times
of immersion—in fact, it seems clear that it is delayed no longer than the time required
by the solution to penetrate the fibres, and once it is developed. the immersion may
be prolonged to 20 minutes without further change in the photographs.

That this effect is to be ascribed definitely to the action of sodium sulphide and not
to that of caustic soda produced by hydrolysis of the sulphide, is shown by the fact that
on repeating the test with a chemically equivalent strength of caustic soda (1/3 per
cent.), no appreciable change in the photographs was observed after 10 minutes’
treatment.

A further series of similar experiments was made with Cotswold wool kept stretched
at 70 per cent. extension. At this extension the §-photograph is already practically
at its best, and the initial effect of Na.8 solution shows itself more as a clarifying action
