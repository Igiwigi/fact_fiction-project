Perhaps one day battery power will solve this problem, but not yet. The biggest batteries so
far have been of the order of 32 MWh and the UK daily electricity use is around 1 TWh, so there
remains a big gap to be filled on cloudy, wind-less winter months. Coal, oil and gas will always
remain as precious raw resources, of finite magnitude, useful in many ways. But burning them
for heat seems not to be part of a sustainable planet. The CO2 they produce can in principle be
captured by the technique of carbon sequestration, where the CO? is frozen out from the power
station exhaust gases and pumped to some old gas field for storage. In practice this technique has
not yet proved commercially viable, and no such plant exists at present. Burning coal, with its
associated sulfur dioxide emissions, is also a serious health hazard by any standards.

Geothermal and hydro share with coal, oil and gas the fact that they are not uniformly
available over our Earth in the quantities needed to provide base-load power. Gas pipelines can
partially overcome this but carry the risk that supplies can be cut for political reasons. Electricity
interconnectors carry a similar risk, and until we have an interconnector circling the globe there
is the problem that cloudy, wind-less weather can persist over whole continents!

Fission power ticks many of the boxes, although fast reactors, which breed their own fissile
material, are necessary for truly sustainable energy. Fission energy, which the UK has pioneered,
has served us well, but it is not without risk and its public acceptance is fragile. There are three
serious risks, as illustrated in figure 3:

(i) A fission reactor carries within its core a great deal of fuel, which in the wrong
circumstances can lead to a catastrophic criticality, as at Chernobyl.
