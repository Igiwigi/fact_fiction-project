comes from just below No. 11, and shows the branch that comes off at this level,
while Photo. 39 is from the region just above No. 11. These photographs indicate that
the resin canals also become gradually grouped into two series, and that these are associated
with the two rings. In fact, the two series become so distinct, both in tangential and
radial position (Photo. 38), that one suspects that they have different causes. The inner
one is more traumatic in appearance and the reason is apparent a few sections farther on. Photo. 39 shows a branch (No. 1) just above the region where the series was most dense
in Photo. 38.
