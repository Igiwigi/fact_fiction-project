the posterior liver lobes
arise from the incurled edges of the “entoderm platte,’ the origin of which is not
described. It consists of a plate of epithelium behind the proctodeeum on the posterior
dorsal side of the yolk sac, and from RetcHENBACH’s figures lies distinctly external to the
secondary yolk pyramids. In fact, it bears exactly the same relation to the yolk pyramids
as the epithelial liver rudiment does in Hemimysis. ReicHeNBACH states that the
anterior and middle liver lobes arise in a similar manner, but he describes yolk cells
separating from the pyramids to give the liver epithelium (pp. 107-11). His figures of
this process are not convincing.
