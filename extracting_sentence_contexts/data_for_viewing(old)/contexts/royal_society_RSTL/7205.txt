Als the year 1843 a friend of mine, Mr. Exx1s of Falmouth, sent me some bottles of seq-
rater from the Mediterranean, which I subjected- to a chemical examination, a work
Swhich induced me to collect what other chemists had determined about the constitution
Sof the water of the great Ocean. This labour convinced me that our knowledge of. the
Scomposition of sea-water was very deficient, and that we knew very little about the
Mifferences in composition which occur in different parts of the sea.
& TI entered into this labour more as a geologist than as a chemist, wishing-principally
<o find facts which could serve as a basis for the explanation of those effects. that have
Aaken Place at the formation of those voluminous beds which once were deposited at
She bottom of the ocean. I thought that it was absolutely necessary to know with
precision the composition of the water of the present ocean, in order to form an. opinion
About the action of that ocean from which the mountain limestone, the oolite and the
Zhalk with its flint have been deposited, in the same way as it has been of the most
material influence upon science to know the chemical actions of the present volcanos,
Sn order to determine the causes which have acted in forming the older plutonic and
many of the metamorphic rocks. Thus I determined to undertake a series of investi-
Zgations upon the composition of the water of the ocean, and of its large inlets and bays,
Zand ever since that time T have assiduously collected and analyzed water from the dif-
Skerent, parts of the sea. Tt is evident that it was impossible to collect this material in a
Echort time, and without the assistance of many friends of science, and I most gratefully
