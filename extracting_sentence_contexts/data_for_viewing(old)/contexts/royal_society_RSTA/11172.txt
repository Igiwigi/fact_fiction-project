The distance between successive discharges is the same for all metals we have tried,
which shows that the resistance of the metal vapour cannot be a dominating portion
of the whole resistance, for doubtless different metal vapours will differ in resistance,
especially as they must be present in very varying quantities, owing to differences in
volatility. As we can count about ten discharges, we may take it that the damping
is small and therefore the time of an oscillation 24\/LC, if L is the self-induction.
From this we calculate that our self-induction was about 3000; for steady currents
a rough estimate of our circuit gave a self-induction of 1000, and we know that
for rapid oscillations it must be greater. If we adopt the higher number, we may
further conclude that the total resistance of our circuit must have been small
compared to 20 ohms, while, taking the lower estimate for the coefficient of self-
induction, the resistance was small compared to 12 ohms, a further proof, if one
were needed, of the fact that once the insulating property of air is broken down,
its conductivity may be large. We do not wish to enter further into some interesting

questions connected with this matter, as we are only concerned with the bearing of
our experiments on the main subject of our research. :

The curved lines of the oscillatory discharges may serve as a basis for the caleu-
lation of the molecular velocities, and if this is done, higher values are obtained
