yery limited distribution of the roots, and the fact that no water was added 4
growth, which would tend to distribute any s0luble or otherwise easily transpo
matters, are conditions all consistent with the almost total absence of Nitrogen in t
8011. Lastly in regard to the results in the Table (X1.), the final column, showing the
or loss of Nitrogen, affords us the means of judging how far the molecular actions
which free Nitrogen was given off in the cases of the experiments upon the d
position of nitrogenous organic matter are likely to interfere with the results of
investigations on the question of assimilation of free Nitrogen by plants. It is seen
in the experiments now under consideration, no free Nitrogen was given off during
process of germination and growth.
