Their description is in terms of a
gauge theory with group SU(2) x U(1), and it is not consistent to add masses by hand. In this gauge group, we have four quantum numbers similar to electric charge: three for weak
isospin (the SU(2) part) and one for weak hypercharge (the U(1) part). It is a remarkable fact about
the weak interactions (as obtained by numerous experiments), that the left- and right-handed
components of quarks and leptons couple differently to the force fields. This fact protects them
from acquiring mass if we try to use the analogy with how we represent the mass of the electron
in quantum electrodynamics (QED). Adding by hand a mass term in the SM again violates gauge
invariance and renders the theory inconsistent.
