Although the concepts
of salience, confidence and attention may appear distinct,
their intimate relationship can be interpreted as an integral
part of perceptual inferenceâ€”reflecting the different faces
of precision.

(b) Gain control mechanisms in the cortico-pulvino-
cortical connectivity

There are multiple thalamocortical mechanisms that can
modulate the gain of prediction error in superficial layers of
the cortex. Here, we consider three possible mechanisms
through which the pulvinar contributes to gain control:
(i) induction of phase synchrony across presynaptic neurons
within a cortical region, perhaps achieved by (ii) modulation
of low-frequency (alpha) oscillation across cortical regions
and (iii) modulation of prediction error units in the superficial
layers via diffuse projections. The first mechanism reflects the fact that synchronized
presynaptic spikes generally make the postsynaptic impact
stronger. Thus, controlling the degree of synchrony at presyn-
aptic neurons can serve as a gain control mechanism [59,60]. This can be achieved by synchronous modulation of subthres-
hold membrane potentials at the gamma frequency [61].
