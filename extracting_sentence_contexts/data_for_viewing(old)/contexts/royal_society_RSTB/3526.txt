If the above interpretation be correct, then the cell-plug in question must belong

morphologically to the posterior lip of the blastopore, and the posterior segment of
the floor of the future archenteric canal. It would thus be in part represented, in

the knot of Specimen DD, by the small und not very prominent mass of cells forming
the posterior lip of the blastopore in figs. 9 and 10, Plate 4. The blastopore itself
would then be represented, in the knot of Specimen Y, by the line of continuity
between the vesicular ectoderm and the knot-tissue around the central cell-plug.
And the latter is, in fact, surrounded and limited by a sulcus, the peripheral
boundary of which would represent the blastoporic rim. In text-fig. 6, we present
a schematic surface-projection of the central plug in relation to the rest of the
knot, showing its overlapping anteriorly.

On the whole, we consider it as at least highly probable that this cell-plug is to be
regarded as simply a protruding mass of the cellular tissue of the primitive knot,
around which the lips of the blastopore become defined, and which is eventually
overlapped, in front and laterally, by the closing in of those lips, whilst, posteriorly,
it retains its connection with the posterior lip. This forms a bulging mass, which
