Let us imagine,
then, some unknown world, some Laputa (devoted to philosophy) in which the chemistry

* Chemists aro placed in regard to the ideal elements X @, , v, and those combinations of them which
cannot be rezolyed into our actual elemental bodies, in a yery similar position to that occupied by astronomers
(if I may yenture on such a comparison) towards the planet Ni eptune prior to its detection by the telescope. The existence of the planet Neptune could Ã¾e inferred, as a highly probable contingeney, from the perturbations
of the orbit of Uranus; and yet this planet might have remained for eyer unscen by man. $0, too, the existence of
the element x; may be similarly inferred from the peculiar forms of chemical metamorphosis ; and yet this ele-
mont may never be isolated as an independent reality. Tt may exist and exercise (80 to 8ay) an appreciable
influence upon the moyements of our system, and nevertheloss lie far beyond the range of facts accessible to our
methods of experiment. No scientific hypothesis can have any claim whatever upon our notice which is inca-
Pable of experimental verification (a truth too often forgotten in chemical speculations) ; but this verification
may be a yery tardy proces, and involyes numerous trials and numerous failures before in either sense (80 as
to enable us to deny or affirm the hypothesis) it is accomplished,
