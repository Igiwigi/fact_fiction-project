Syalue. It proves that the generative gland is an outgrowth from, and organically the
development of the & segmental organ.”
© Itis a fact which brings the generative system of this worm, hitherto 80 incompre-
Shensible, within the rule which governs the formation of this system in the Annelida in
Seneral®,
Z The two ciliated tubes, one on either side, which are contained in this testicular ring,
Sdiffer in no respect whatever from those (fig. 5) of the non-generative rings, but in that
2vf ze. They are considerably larger than the latter, 80 much 80 as to be quite visible
Sto the naked eye.
Z The botryoidal vascular appendage (fig. 5, 9g g) exhibits the same character. The
£tubal portion (5 e) is only more densely coiled and complicated. 'The umbrella-shaped
Zextremity is very large, and the cilia act with great force. Neither HerNG, DE QUaTRE-
Spacns, nor GEGENBAUER allude anywhere in their writings to the fact, which is 80 signi-
Eficant i in a homological sense, of the increased size of the ciliated tubes of the generative
ſegments in Lumbricus.
SZ Before proceeding to investigate the contents of the second (from behind forwards)
Soenerative ring, it is material that the dissector should convince himself that in the first
Zring nothing connected with the reproductive organs is contained but the testes and the
Qciliated tubes Jjust described. No ducts crossing the space can be discovered, no ovaries
or sacculi of any description.

There is therefore every reason to believe that the viscera bounded by the septa of
this ring are distinct and independent, and wholly unconnected with those of the adja-
cent rings, and that they communicate externally by separate ducts whose openings are
within the limits of this ring. This ring, then, is exclusively dedicated to the male
