In the Bird the
pigmented oil globules of the cones are likewise red, yellow, or green, and never blue
or violet. The blue structural choroid of the Tapetum fibrosum is always tempered by
the overlying retinal pigment, so that in the Ungulates which have this tapetum we
do not get blue or violet fundi, with the sole exception of Capra, and even then it is
mixed with red or green, so that the fundus is mauve or greenish-blue. The fact that a very large number of nocturnal animals have golden-yellow, or gold
and green, fundi, and that we find green fundi in the Carnivores which prowl at dusk,
seems well worth consideration, especially as it is well known, that after nightfall, or
in very dim light, all colours lose their distinctiveness and appear uniform, with the
exception of yellow and orange. I am not able myself to bring the colours I have found in the Fundus oculi in
harmony with the three-colour theory, although possibly some relation may be found
on further investigation. f

The existence of a dark peripheral area, a so-called Tapetum nigrum, wherever we
have a highly-reflecting Tapetum lucidum, seems to point to the necessity of preventing
reflection beyond a certain area in order to avoid blurred images. I very much doubt
whether any sight exists over the area of the Tapetum nigrum, especially as the latter
never occurs in animals having a high degree of divergence, which is indispensable to
a great range of vision.
