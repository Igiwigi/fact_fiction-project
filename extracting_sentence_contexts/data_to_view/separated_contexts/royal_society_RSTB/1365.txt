Yorkshire Geol. and Polytechnic Soc.,’ vol. 8, 1884, p. 375). They point out, quite justly, that
the similarity in cortical structure is not by itself sufficient to prove identity. They go on, however,
to state that the axial structure of Astromyelon bears “by no means a close resemblance to that of
Myriophylloides.” This is a mistake, arising from the fact that, at that time, the primary wood of
Myriophylloides had not been recognised. ‘The structure of the original specimen of Myriophylloides is
in fact identical with that of Astromyelon. For example, there is no real difference, except in age,
between the root shown in “ Organization,” Part XII., Plate 28, fig. 2 (Myriophylloides), and that shown
in Plate 27, fig, 3 (typical Astromyelon). On comparing our own fig. 1 (Myriophyloides) with fig. 2,
which is from a typical Astromyelon, the essential identity of structure becomes obyious.
