HADDON

Ita slightly thickened dorsal extremity is almost in contact with the inter marie of
the rook of the creseentic process of the tripus (te.), with which it is connected hy a
fow short radial fibres. The inferior limb of the post-temmporal (pt.i.) is very massive,
and articulates internally with the basioceipital (bo.), and along its dorsal edge with
(iw angle which the posterior and opisthotie plates of the exovcipital make with each
other at the postero-lateral region of the skull. Tle air-bladder (fig. 66) is also very similar im shape and relative size to that of
Auchenipterus, The anterior chamber (a.c.) is fairly large, and its lateral walls are ay
close and extensive contact with the superficial skin, The transverse septum (#.s,) is
attached dorsally to the body of the fifth vertebra, and anteriorly to this to a longi-
tudinal ridge which traverses each of the lateval surfaces of the complex centrum and
marks the dorsal limit of the superficial ossifieations, and also coincides with the mer
margin of the corresponding triangular fbrovs sheet of the dorsal wall of the anterior
chamber, The lateral portions of the anterior wall of the bladder are extremely thin
and translucent where the distal plates of the “ elastic spring” mechanism are applied
to them, in fact, the latter project into the cavity of the anterior chamber, pushing in
the thin wall of the bladder before them, At the point of closest eontaet of the two
structures the tunica externa is entirely wanting, and only the thin inner tunica
invests the inwardly projecting extremities of the two plates,* The peripheral
margins of the plates are somewhat firmly attached to the wall of the bladder by
colnectiye tissue. The posterior extremity of the bladder has a small rudiment of a
posterior cectm (p.c.) sub-divided internally by a backward prolongation of the
longitudinal septum which, anteriorly, separates the two lateral compartments from
each other. The Weberian ossicles are mueb the same as in Avehenipterus.
