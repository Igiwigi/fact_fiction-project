The arbitrary constant is determined by the fact that at the beginning of the flight
da/dt = (muzzle-speed) x (cosine of angle between barrel and the « axis)

Since we reckon ¢ and s to be zero at the vertex, this value of @ occurs when ¢ = —a,
where a is the time of ascent, and when s = —1, where / is the maximum height attained. When the arbitrary constant has been removed from (15) in this way, we obtain
