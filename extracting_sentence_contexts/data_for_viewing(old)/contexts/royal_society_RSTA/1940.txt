obtained by linearizing around a small step height. This provided an avenue to study these waves
in three dimensions using linear theory [26-28]. While we did not consider the linearized elastic
sheet problem here, the wave behaviour in this problem can be obtained using a method similar
to the corresponding analysis in [18]. This suggests that it is possible to study elastic waves
in a linearized three-dimensional regime, in which the waves typically arise due to Airy-type
behaviour in the analytically continued complex domain.

Many of the most interesting questions regarding waves in elastic sheets arise in the study
of flexural-gravity waves; that is, including the effects of gravity. This is the natural next step to
explore using exponential asymptotic methods. Given the similarity between gravity-capillary
and flexural-gravity waves, it is likely that an analysis of this sort would share many similarities
with the gravity—capillary studies of Trinh & Chapman [24,25]. Implementing a computational
scheme for the full nonlinear flexural-gravity wave problem would be challenging due to the fact
that the different wave contributions propagate in opposite directions (as in the gravity—capillary
problem, discussed in detail in [25]), making numerical studies more complicated.
