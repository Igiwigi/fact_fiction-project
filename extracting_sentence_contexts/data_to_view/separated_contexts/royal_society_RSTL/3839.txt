The character of the formidable hooks, supported by the acetabula of the arms,
is now exclusively manifested by the genus Onychoteuthis. Thus the extinct Belemnite combined characters at present divided amongst four
distinet genera of Dibranchiate Cephalopods, Spirula, Sepia, Sepiola, and Onycho-
teuthis. But, notwithstanding the auncinated character of the arms, the balance of
its natural affinities seems to me till to preponderate in favour of its position as a
transitional link between Spirula and Sepia: and the additional facts which we have
now unexpectedly gained, while they show new and unsuspected radiations of affinity
tending to complete the reticular interdependencies of the Cephalopods, do not dis-
turb, but confirm the position of the Belemnite, in the linear series of the genera of
that class which I proposed in 1836. The Belemnite, with the advantage of its dart-shaped and well-balanced shell, must
have enjoyed the power of swimming backwards and forwards by the action of its
cephalic and pallial fins, with greater vigour and precision than the modern Deca-
pod Dibranchiata. The position of the animal was, most probably, more habitually
vertical than that of its recent congeners.
