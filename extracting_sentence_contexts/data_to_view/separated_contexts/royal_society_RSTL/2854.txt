This is most remarkable at Singapore, where, though the successive low waters often
diter by six feet, the mean level only oscillates through a few inches. At Plymouth
the mean level is not quite 80 steady. The fact is, that at that port the low water
varies more by the difference of springs and neaps than the high water does; and
hence the mean level slightly follows the low water, and is lowest at spring tides, and
highest at neap tides, or perhaps more exactly a day or two later. < The level of the sea at low water,” a phrase sometimes used by surveyors, is al-
together erroneous, and may lead to material error.
