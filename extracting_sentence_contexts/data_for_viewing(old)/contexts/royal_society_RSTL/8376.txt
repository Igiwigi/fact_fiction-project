cuneiform ; the rising was yery slight on our specimen, and is only imperfectly. seen in
the drawing. On the posterior part of the inner wall we see two facets divided by a groove
for the external and posterior part of the navicular (in the Hog these two facets haye
coalesced into an elongated 8ingle facet on the posterior border of the inner wall of the
cuboid). This posterior margin of the internal wall shows in Zyopotamus a considerable
bulging inwards, into the middle of the tarsus (sen in Plate XXXVI1L. fig. 10), which
makes this cuboid much broader than the corresponding bone of the Diplopus (fig. 11),
where this bulging is much less, nearly identical with that of a hog's cuboid.

The outer $urface of the cuboid is rounded. If we look at the external surface of the
cuboid of a hog we shall see a deep sulcus for the peronzeus tendon situated between the
posterior prolongation of the cuboid and the distal articular facet ; this sulcus is absent in
Hyopotamus, owing to the fact that the posterior part of the cuboid is not produced
downwards, as we shall immediately see. The posterior surface of the cuboid is con-
siderably broader than the anterior, as is to be scen in fig. 10, while in Diplopus (fig. 11),
and especially in the Hog, the converse is the case. Besides, looking at the cuboid from
the posterior aspect, we perceive a very broad and rough transverse ridge for muscular
and ligamentous attachment, running through the whole breadth of the bone as it is seen
in fig. 10 from below. The Anoplotherium and the [[ippopotamus have nearly the same
transverse ridge on the back part of the cuboid; only it descends lower down, while
in Zyopotamus this ridge does not reach the leyel of the distal articular surface of the
cuboid, which is the lowest point of the bone ; we shall by-and-by indicate the difference
presented in this respect by the cuboid of Diplopus.

"The distal surface (Plate XXXVIIIL. fig. 10) is the most important, as it presents the
