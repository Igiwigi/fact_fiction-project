degree of development as in the pure form. In a like degree this applies to the
skeleton, pigment, and pedicellaria Thus the presence of the posterior ciliated
epaulette, posterior pedicellaria, green pigment, when inherited through the egg or
sperm in hybrids, is never accompanied by the rate of growth, or marked by the
attainment of the same size, as that characteristic of their condition in the

pure forms.

8. THE INHERITANCE OF THE LARVAL SKELETON.

In the large number of papers that have appeared on the subject of Echinoderm
hybridization the skeleton has been selected as the principal structure that has been
used in elucidating parental influence. â€˜This has been in great part due to the fact
that in the early pluteus, from four to seven days old, the skeleton is one of the most
obvious features. In many of the forms investigated, this structure has quite a
different arrangement; in some, the postoral arm skeleton being arranged in the form
of smooth calcareous rods; in others, the skeleton throughout is highly toothed or
covered with spinous processes; while again in others, the postoral rods are multiple
