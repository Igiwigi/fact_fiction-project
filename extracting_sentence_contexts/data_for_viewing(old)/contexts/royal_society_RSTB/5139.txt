well-defined ligament, which runs from it below the cartilage (as yet unossified) of the
petrosal. The stapes is of the usual stirrup shape, and has a well-developed stapedial
muscle. The stapedial artery runs through the stapes protected by a cartilage canal
which, as can be seen in other forms, becomes ossified, as it does in many of the Insectivora.

As regards the boundaries of the region of the middle ear, the most noticeable character
is, of course, the enlargement of the ear space to house the hypertrophied head of the
malleus. There has been some difference of opinion as to the elements which take part
in the formation of this epitympanic cavity. According to Hyrrt it is formed by a
divergence of the wings of the sphenoid, and the squamosal takes no part in it. Van
Kampen, on the other hand, considers it to be bounded by the squamosal, and the cavity
to lie “ as usual between the squamosal and the periotic.”” That Van Kamprn, in spite
of the fact that he had only dried adult skulls to examine, was the more correct is shown
clearly enough by the sections (text-figs. 2 and 3) of this embryo. The greater part of
the roof of the epitympanic cavity, however, is formed not so much by the squamosal,
as VAN Kampen states, as by a wing which runs upwards from the vestibular end of the
petrosal and curves round the head of the malleus, following its outline pretty closely.
This part of the roof, after passing over the head, joins the squamosal, which bounds the
lateral parts of the malleus and extends backwards over the larger part of the ear region
(diagram, text-fig. 1). In a young skull of C. trevelyani (Plate 15, fig. 3) this part, seen
from the inner face, shows the junction between the petrosal flange and the squamosal
as a clearly-defined ridge.

Certain other structures seen in the embryo may be mentioned briefly. The
tympanic ring is still open towards the outer side, and on its front border there
