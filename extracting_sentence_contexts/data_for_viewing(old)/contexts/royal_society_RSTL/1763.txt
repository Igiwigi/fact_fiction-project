A PENDULUM FOR THE REDUCTION TO A VACUUM. 461

have thought of verifying the suspicion of Nzwrox that 8uch an effect was pro-
bable *#. M. Pony, in his Nouvelle Architecture Hydraulique, and Dr. Youxc,
in his Lectures on Natural Philosophy (both of whom have taken an active
part in the investigations relative to the pendulum) make frequent allusions to
Dv Bvuarz's work : yet neither of these distinguisghed mathematicians appears
to have recollected the singular facts recorded by that author. And even in
M. Po1ssoN's late excellent memoir, inserted in the Connaissance des Tems for -
1834, although in the Appendix thereto the author's attention has been called
to M. Du Buar's experiments by a notice from another quarter, yet it is eyi-
dent that when that distinguished mathematician commenced his paper, he was
not aware of the facts stated in M. Du Buart's work : as he frequently, and
very justly, alludes to M. BesseL as the first person who had directed the
attention of the public to the true correction. And it certainly is but a poor
consolation to the practical philosopher, who thus devotes so much of his time
to the elucidation of any particular branch of science, to find that his labours
may be $0 s00n forgotten, and probably lost sight of for eyer.
