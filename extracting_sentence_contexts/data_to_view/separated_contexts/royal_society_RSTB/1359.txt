G. HOPKINS ON THE PIGMENTS OF THE PIERIDA.

|

Summary of the Facts detailed in this Paper.

1. The scales of white Pieride contain uric acid, and the presence of this substance.
is, in fact, the cause of the opaque milky whiteness, characteristic of the wings of
such insects. :

2. The scales of allied yellow insects are pigmented with a substance closely
related to uric acid, the yellow pigment being in all probability identical with a
product obtained when uric acid is heated with water under pressure. |

3. The yellow substance may be traced in all the genera of the Pieride, and with
the exception of another closely allied red pigment, is probably the only coloured
scale-pigment present ; its colour effects may, however, be modified by superadded
interference phenomena, or by pigments found, not in the scales, but between the
chitinous laminze of the wing itself.
