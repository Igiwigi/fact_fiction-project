surfaces which will presently be described. A fine example of this is shown in
Conglomerate Cliffs, eastward from Portally Head towards Oonarontia and Red
F : in this district the bedding is completely masked by the nearly vertical planes of
and cleavage surfaces, which give a rudely prigmatic and columnar appearance to
cliffs. Near Swiny Head this structure is remarkably well developed, and has pro-
duced a singular effect: one of the rude columns formed by the joint and cleavage surfaces
has fallen partially forward, and presents an appearance, especially when seen from the
ea, which resembles some of the old stone crosses found in many parts of Ireland.
- One of the most striking circumstances connected with the joint surfaces in the con-
omerate, is the fact that the large quartz pebbles, often 5 inches diameter, are cut
across as if with a knife, forming a plane rigorously parallel to the general plane of
he joint. The same remarkable fact is constantly observed in the joint surfaces of the
niferous limestone all through Ireland ; in which T have frequently observed a fossil
Sut in two by the joint plane, half being imbedded in each portion of the divided rock,
nd fitting accurately to each other when joined. In the cleavage planes the same
cumstance is of universal occurrence all through the conglomerate of Waterford.
ording to my idea of the mechanical origin of these various planes, the cleavage
Surfaces are perpendicular to the lines of maximum force, and the joint surfaces per-
Sendicular to the lines of minimum force, or maximum force of 8hrinkage. if 1 may use
Khbarbarous word. The cleavage structure appears to have been first developed in the
-Zock, and the jointed structure subsequently added by the shrinking of the rock-mass,
Sonsequent upon evaporation and drying. This shrinking and contraction of the mass
