t all events it is no polar current, which will easily be seen in comparing it with the
Baffin's Bay current with a salinity 33-281, or the water to the north of Spitzbergen
Sith 33-623, or the Patagonian polar current, which runs along the west coast, of South
Wmerica, and has 33:966. Nor is it probable that it comes from the north shores of

eria, where such a great number of powerful rivers bring a vast quantity of fresh
mater into the 8ea. Its salinity is 80 great that it even exceeds that of the South
Ftlantic Region, between 30? S. lat. and the line between the Cape of Good Hope and

pe Horn, whose salinity is only 35-038.
-Z Fifth Region, A. The Baffin's Bay and Davis Straits Region. —The mean of eight
Smplete analyses is 33-281, the maximum 34-414, the minimum 32-304. This region
Hows the very interesting fact that its salinity increases on passing from latitude 64*
Sward the North, being in 64 32-926, in 67* 33:187, somewhat further to the North
$446, and in latitude 69? 33-598, This peculiarity is owing to the powerful current
Fom the Parry Islands, which through different sounds passes into Baffin's Bay, where
X is mixed with the great quantity of fresh water that comes into the sea from the West
Yreenland glaciers. Had this fact been known before the sounds that connect the Parry

chipelago with Baffin's Bay were discovered, it might have proved the existence of
Hese sounds, because bays and inlets show quite the reverse ; the further we get into
Aiem the less saline the water becomes.
