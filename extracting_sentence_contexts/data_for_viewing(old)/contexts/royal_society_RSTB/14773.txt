given the multimodal nature of that niche, one might have
expected an elaborate syntax that could freely embed non-
vocal signals sequentially along with vocal ones. This occurs
only to a limited extent, as in ‘The two cars went [claps
hands]’ (see [29]). Instead, multimodal signals are normally
layered over one another (as when saying ‘This one’ with sim-
ultaneous pointing). On the face of it then, linguistic structure
looks remarkably independent of the interactional niche, and
this has made it possible for linguists like Chomsky [30] to
claim that language did not evolve for communication at all.

Here I propose two responses. The first is to point out that
there are in fact many ways in which natural languages adapt
through cultural evolution to the interactional niche, certainly
more than normally meet the linguist’s eye. This section
spells those out. The second is to sketch how in fact the
very core of language structure may owe its origin to the mul-
timodal niche in which language most likely evolved, which . sae .
is the subject of the rest of the paper. 3. Spatial cognition In language structure

It is possible to make quite a list of features of linguistic There is a long tradition in the analysis of language, often
structure and organization that indubitably owe their origin called localism, going right back to Aristotle that holds that

In addition, as pointed out in [35], syntactic dependencies
can hold across turns, as when one speaker completes the
