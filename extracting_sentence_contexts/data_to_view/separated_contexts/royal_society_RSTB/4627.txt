This produced
a sufficient surface layer, practically free from red corpuscles, to enable a drop to be
taken conveniently for examination, without producing any significant sedimentation
of the platelets of the normal sample. We made a number of attempts to obtain quantitative comparisons by counting
the platelets, and to facilitate this by staining. We soon reached the conclusion,
however, that numerical records gave a purely fictitious appearance of accuracy to
a comparison between normal samples, in which the platelets were separate and
evenly distributed, and abnormal samples, in which the few remaining in suspension
in the plasma were agglutinated into clumps. We found, however, that the use of the
