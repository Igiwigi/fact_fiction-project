limits of error for nitrous oxide and olefiant gas. Indeed it is only when 8 inches or
more of the column haye been cut away that the difference begins to make itself felt.
Thus, in carbonie oxide, the absorption of a length of 41-4 being 12:2, that of a chamber
49-4, or 8 inches longer, is only 12:9, making a difference of only 0-7 per cent., while
the same 8 inches acting singly on the gas produces an absorption of 96 per cent. So
also with regard to carbonic acid; a tube 41-4 absorbing 12:7 per cent., a tube 494
absorbs only 13:0 per cent,—making a difference of only 0:3 per cent. As regards olefiant
gas (Table IX.), while a distance of 8 inches acting singly effects an absorption of 44 per
cent., the addition of 8 inches to a tube already 41-4 inches in length raises the absorp-
tion only from 65:3 to 675, or 2:2 per cent. The reason is plain. In a length of 414
the rays capable of being absorbed by the gas are 80 much diminished, 80 few in fact
remain to be attacked, that an additional 8 inches of gas produces a scarcely sensible
effect. Similar considerations explain the fact, that while by augmenting the length of

the first chamber from 2:8 inches to 15:4 inches we increase the absorption of olefiant gas
nearly 20 per cent., the shortening of the second chamber by precisely the same amount
effects a diminution of barely 4 per cent. of the absorption. All these results conspire to
prove the heterogeneous character of the radiation from a source heated to about 250® C.

The suwm of the absorptions placed side by side with the absorption of the &um ex-
