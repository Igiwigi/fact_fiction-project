that sterilization can take place; this will be found in the answer to questio
the Psilotacew the sporangia are grouped in synangia, the number of loc
from one to five ; their appearance and arrangement certainly would sugges
of a common origin, by subdivision of simpler parts. The similarity of the sy
of Psilotum to the sporangiophore of Equisetwm would indicate that the mode,
of these parts was probably somewhat similar, |

(4.) Is there direct evidence in any Vascular Cryptogam of conversion of )
sporogenous tissue into masses of sterile tissue, or conversely of conversion o
septa into spore-producing cells ? Professor Gorse has shown that the trabeculs of Isoetes are derived

the same appears to be not improbable for Lepidostrobus.* Gorpen remarks (*
of Botany,’ 1892, p. 358) that he “would only attach a biological, that
adaptive, significance to the fact.” My point is that the requirements so w
by Isoetes in the formation of its sterile trabecule, probably made themselve
other plants with large spore-bearing members, and the adaptations to mee
if successful, would become stereotyped as permanent morphological fact
Tmesipteris also, the normal septum is similar in origin to the sporogenous 1
and is undistinguishable from them while young; thus, from the development:
of view it may also be looked upon as a result of sterilization. But, conver
has been shown that in certain abnormal synangia of Z'mesipteris the sept
be completely absent, while in others it has been demonstrated that those
which normally form the septum may become sporogenous ; there is accordin
absolute and essential difference between tissue of the septum and the spore
tissue in the septate synangium of Tmesipteris. Thus, our observations afford answers to the four questions above put forwa
it is true that the evidence is neither over-abundant nor conclusive.
