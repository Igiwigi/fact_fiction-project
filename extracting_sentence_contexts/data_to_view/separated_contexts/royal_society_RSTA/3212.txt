We observe that the conventional lower bound of the two models are almost identical. This
confirms the usefulness of the simple Zz Yukawa model for the purpose of studying the lower
bound. The reason for this agreement simply lies in the fact that the bottom Yukawa coupling is
much smaller than that of the top quark, with the latter dominating the dynamics near the lower
bound. The situation is different at large Higgs self-coupling: here, the different number of scalar
degrees of freedom plays a substantial role which leads to a narrowing of the IR window, now
having its centre near 200 GeV. This model is also of interest, because it is used for non-perturbative studies of the Higgs
mass bounds in lattice simulations [34-37].
