But further, as the separate carpels of the orange are
= collectively invested by a general integument, which also to a certain degree dips down
S between them, and which fills up what would otherwise be yoid spaces about the two
5 poles of the spheroid, s0 shall we find that the proper walls of the spirally arranged
Pegments of Polystomella are strengthened and consolidated by a secondary calcareous
&deposit upon their external surface, corresponding to that * intermediate skeleton,” of
Z which less developed examples have already been furnished by Cycloclypens, Tetero-
= 8tegina, Operculina, and Amphistegina,—its most distinctive peculiarity in Polystomella
= being its extraordinary thickness on the two lateral surfaces of all but the last formed
> whorl. Z 183. The spire of Polystomella, like that of other nautiloid Foraminifera, commences
= in a central cell, the dimensions of which are extremely variable; the difference between
& the extremes of its 8ize being, in fact, not less remarkable than that which I have
= 8hown to present itself in Orbitolites (First Series, © 44). Thus in Plate XVII. fig. 3,
Z which represents a section of the five inner whorls of a full-grown specimen, taken
J through the equatorial plane, we trace a progressive diminution in the s8ize of the
: chambers as we approach the central cell, which is itself no larger than the chambers
i in nearest proximity to it.
