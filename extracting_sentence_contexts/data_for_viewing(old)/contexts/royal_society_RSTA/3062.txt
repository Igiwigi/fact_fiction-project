for all p € 2. We may thus employ proposition A.2. a
Corollary D.9. Let T4,7g ¢ T be monoids such that Ta C Tg. Then the induced equivalence relations

This again implies that there exists an equivalence relation ~fof in the effective state space 2/ ~f such
that

Proof. This follows from the fact that Ta is secret towards “ye together with proposition D.8.
The second statement follows again from proposition A.2. a

Finally, the following proposition shows that equivalence classes [p],/ are preserved by
commuting transformations 7g, providing an operational interpretation to the perspective of
agents (~,,7g): namely, states that are indistinguishable from Bob’s point of view remain
indistinguishable after he applies functions fg € Tp,

Proposition D.10 (Induced perspective is operational). Let T4,7g °T be commuting
transformations. Then the perspective ~ A induced by Ta satisfies
