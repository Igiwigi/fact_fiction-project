It was evident, therefore,
that here was a bacterial organism which could be isolated from moulds by the
simple method of heating the soil, and from the numerous other bacterial organisms
found in the soil, by the use of acid media. The fact was also interesting that it
grew luxuriantly on saccharine gelatine, but, as later experience proved, not on
gelatine or agar containing no sugar or peptone. These facts were sufficient to arrest
attention and to make a further study of the organism comparatively simple. As noted above, the colonies on saccharose-gelatine plates occur in the form of large
drops, 1-2 millims. in diameter, at the end of 3 days, and rising about 0Â°5 millim.
