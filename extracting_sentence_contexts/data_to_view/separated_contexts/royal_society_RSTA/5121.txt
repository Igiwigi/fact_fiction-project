If we
find the series of first integrals (in the next section I illustrate, on the cubic, the
general method of finding this series), we may form from among them the functions
of differential invariants, of semi-invariants, and of matrices which are constant along
the curve. These functions may be properly called (each in its proper sphere, as
homographic or Cartesian) differential expressions for the invariants of the curve. It is perhaps worthy of remark that in showing the mode of integrating the
