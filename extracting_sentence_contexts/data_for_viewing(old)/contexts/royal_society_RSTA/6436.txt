On the contrary, SEDI shows a reinforcement of drought magnitude in large regions such as
Eastern Europe and Eastern China. SPEI shows a reinforcement of droughts in comparison with
the trend of meteorological droughts in some regions. Figure 4b shows that the most important
differences between SPI and SPEI can be found in Australia and parts of Asia and Africa.

Trends show important differences between the boreal winter and summer seasons (electronic
supplementary material, figure S9), with larger areas affected by changes in indices using AED
during the boreal summer. SPEI shows significant negative trends in Western North America,
Australia, Southern Europe, Eastern, Central and Southern Africa and parts of South America.
These trends are not identified by the SPI. During the boreal summer, SEDI decreases across much
of central Europe, central Africa and much of Asia, indicating drier conditions. The standardized
P-ET, on the other hand, does not reinforce dry conditions when compared with the SPI. This
pattern is due to the fact that most of the regions with increased SPEI drought severity correspond
to areas where soil water limitations are present and ET is controlled by precipitation. As a
result, even though increased AED causes plants in water-limited regions to become more water
stressed, P-ET is unable to detect this response.

The evolution of the percentage of the global area affected by severe, moderate and mild
drought based on different drought metrics on a three-month timescale shows no apparent trends
with the SPI and standardized P-ET (electronic supplementary material, figure S10). The SPE
shows an increase in the drying conditions in the last decade, while the SEDI shows a clear
increase since 2000. The observed trends in metrics like SPEI and SEDI indicate an increased
imbalance between what the atmosphere demands and the existing water availability (measured
