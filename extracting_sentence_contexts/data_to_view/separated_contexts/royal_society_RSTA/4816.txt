Early evidence of tripletâ€”triplet annihilation in fluorescent organic
light-emitting diodes

In contrast to the enhancement mechanisms outlined above, there is no fundamental reason
why the TTA mechanism would require drastically altered structure and properties of emitting
molecules or adjacent materials relative to normal OLED design rules, e.g. a high radiative
rate and quantum yield of fluorescence. Hence, the fortuitous TTA processes could explain a
substantial part of the curve depicted in figure 1. In fact, observations of delayed fluorescence
in organic solids and the TTA mechanism as its plausible source predate the invention of
OLEDs by several decades (for a review of an early work, see [19]). Hence it may be somewhat
surprising that the first suggestion of the TTA-related enhancement of the efficiency of fluorescent
OLEDs appeared only in 1998 [7]. The higher-than-expected EQE at unconventionally high
current densities in doped Alq,-based OLED led authors to propose the TTA as a source of the
observed enhancement.
