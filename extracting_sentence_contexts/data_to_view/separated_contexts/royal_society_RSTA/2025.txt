However, equation (3.31) with conditions (2.57)-(2.59) admits the exact solution.

First, let us consider the case when Cp = 1. Applying Laplace transform to the problem (3.31),
(2.57)-(2.59), its solution in transforms can be readily obtained as follows:

Applying to (3.33) the inverse Laplace transform and returning to the original variables X and t

Here, subscript 1 denotes the fact that at X=0, the concentration is equal to 1. If Co(t) is an
arbitrary function, then the concentration of the contaminant in the fracture can be obtained by
using Duhamel’s formula [31]

The explicit presentation for the function C(t, X), when at the fracture’s inlet the concentration
of the radioactive solute reduces exponentially, ie. Co(t) =e~“4t, can be obtained by analogy with
the derivation of the formula (3.35).
