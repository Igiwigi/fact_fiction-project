published results [18]. It can be seen from this plot that N is
well fit by a linear function proportional to the log of the flagel-
lar length. Other functions might fit the relation between N
and L just as well, but for our purposes, here, we simply use
the logarithmic relation as an Ansatz that allows us to make
a prediction about observed tubulin occupancy. Using the
best-fit line from figure 5a, we converted the lengths for each
data point in Craft et al. into an equivalent train size N, and
then re-plotted the occupancy data in figure 5b.

As shown in figure 5b, the actual measurements of Pemptyr
as reported by Craft ef al. [14], are well fit by a straight line as
predicted from equation (3.2). This result suggests that in fact
tubulin binding to IFT particles may not be length-dependent,
and that the reported length dependence of tubulin loading
onto trains may simply be a result of the decreasing number
of particles per train in longer flagella. In order to definitively
say whether tubulin loading is, or is not, length-dependent, it
will be necessary to quantify the amount of tubulin per IFT
particle. This has been done with non-tubulin cargo [11] but
is more challenging for tubulin because the signal is less
intense. It is to be hoped that in the future, brighter tubulin
constructs will allow this point to be addressed.
