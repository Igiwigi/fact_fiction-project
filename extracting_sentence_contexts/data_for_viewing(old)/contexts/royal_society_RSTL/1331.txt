are rare; and when they occur, they may easily be noticed
as exceptions to the general rules. It appears therefore, that
nearly all the phenomena of the mutual actions of a hundred
different salts may be correctly represented by a hundred
numbers, while, in the usual manner of relating every case as
a different experiment, above two thousand separate articles
would be required.


Dr. YounG's Account of a numerical Table, &c. 149

Having been engaged in the collection of a few of the prin-
cipal facts relating to chemistry and pharmacy, I was induced
to attempt the investigation of a series of these numbers; and
I have succeeded, not without some difficulty, in obtaining
such as appear to agree sufficiently well with all the cases of
double decompoxitions which are fully established, the excep-
tions not exceeding twenty, out of about twelve hundred cases
enumerated by Fouxcroy. The same numbers agree in ge-
neral with the order of simple elective attractions, as usually
laid down by chemical authors; but it was of so much less
importance to accommodate them to these, that I have not
been very solicitous to avoid a few inconsistencies in this re-
spect, especially as many of the bases of the calculation remain
uncertain, and as the common tables of simple elective attrac-
