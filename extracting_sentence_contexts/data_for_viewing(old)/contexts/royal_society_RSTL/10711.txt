vibrates torsionally, s0-called © centrifugal force ” canses torsional motion to be
partially converted into pendulous motion, or vice vers.

When, as in Experiment I., the period of pendulous vibration does not approxi-
mately synchronise with the period of torsional vibration, the phenomenon is not very
pronounced; but when, as in Experiment II., the two periods approach to synchronism,
it is very apparent. Indeed, when the two periods approach sufficiently to synchro-
nism, and the damping is not great, the phenomenon may become 80 marked that,
after a time, almost the whole of the torsional motion becomes converted into
pendulous motion, and presently reconverted again, s0 that the torsional vibrations,
= having firsb diminished to nearly zero, begin to increase again until nearly the initial
'S amplibude has been reached, when once more the torsional motion begins to be con-
Ss verted into pendulous motion, and 80 on.* An interesting fact in connexion with
& this phenomenon is that, if we allow the wire to rest, with oscillations at intervals, the
& Tise and fall becomes much less pronounced, in consequence, probably, of the wire
= gradually allowing its axis to pass more nearly through the centre of mass, but we
Z can easily reproduce it in all its intensity by jarring the wire, or even sometimes by
S change of temperature.

2 Unless there is nearly synchronism between the pendulous and torsional vibrations,
2 there is little or no appreciable effect on the value of the logarithmic decrement, and,
S if we reckon from maximum to maximum, I have found that the logarithmic decre-
= menb is 8ensibly constant, whatever the amplitude, provided the latter does not exceed
8. a certain limit, Similarly there will be little error introduced in our estimation of
