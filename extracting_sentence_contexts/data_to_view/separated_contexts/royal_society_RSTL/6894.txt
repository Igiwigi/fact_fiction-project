17, b). Half an inch or 8 from the
base (Plate XV. fig. 49, b) it changes from the circular to the oyal, and is lightly in-
creased in size from the fact of the left ventricular cavity tapering from its middle
third towards the base (Plate XII. fig. 17, 65). In this portion of the left ventricular
cavity (Plate XV. fig. 49), the chord tendinew and the segments of the bicuspid valve

— hang loosely,
S Receding from the base to the extent of fully an inch (Plate XV. fig. 50, b), the
2 appearance of the left ventricular cavity again changes—the change in this instance
= being caused by the projection into it of the flattened oblique heads of the papillary
=muscles (a, 7), which convert it from an oval shape into an irregularly triangular one
=(Plate XII. fig. 17, w).
