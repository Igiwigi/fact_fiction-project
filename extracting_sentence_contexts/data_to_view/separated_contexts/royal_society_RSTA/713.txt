Thus shock No. 134 gave rise to the following amplitudes
relative to Gages: Olveston 0-17, St John’s 0-10, Bethel 1-0. It is not possible to find
a point which gives an amplitude distribution in accordance with the observations
on the assumption that the amplitude varies only with the distance from the focus. We suggest that in this case the focus was relatively high up in the Soufriére Hills,
roughly equidistant between Gages and Bethel, and that the small amplitude at
Olveston and St John’s may be due either to the fact that owing to the details of the
local topography the direct waves from the focus could not reach these stations or
to the extremely broken nature of the intervening country. Further information on the effect of the intervening topography on the amplitude
of the shocks as recorded at a given station is provided by the results obtained with
the distant shock of 19 June, No. D 8, the Wiechert record for which is shown in fig. 14.
