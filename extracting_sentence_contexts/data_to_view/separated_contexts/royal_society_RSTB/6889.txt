But if Chapman is correct in stating that Vitriwebbina has a finely perforate
wall, with a polymorphine initial stage, then it is certainly distinct. Bullopora, on the contrary, has a coiled initial stage followed by a linear series of
chambers; there is a simple, terminal aperture, and the wall is calcareous, and appears
to be imperforate. This, in fact, seems to be the form described by Cushman in 1929 as
Nubeculinella, which thus becomes a synonym of Bullopora. In B. rostrata the chambers are aludel-shaped, strongly recalling those of Ophthal-
midium, and suggesting that it is really just an Ophthalmidium that has become attached
and uncoiled. Its systematic position is clearly in the family Ophthalmidiidae, sub-
family Nubeculariinae.
