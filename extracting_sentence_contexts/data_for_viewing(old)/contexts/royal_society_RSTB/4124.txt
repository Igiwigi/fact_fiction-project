be ultimately VC in one country, say, Ceylon, and VR in another similar one, say,
South India, owing to the action of one of these factors. But on the average the
commonness will mainly depend upon the age. And to judge from the figures set
forth, for example, in Table VI, no very large number of species need be taken to get
an average ; apparently from 15 to 20 is enough.

All the figures given in this paper go to show that in all reasonable probability
there is little to choose between species in their degree of adaptation to local
conditions. This comes out especially clearly in Table VI, where the whole of the
endemics, taken in groups of not less than 14, show rarity greater than the average
of the whole flora, and yet agree wonderfully closely among themselves in the degree
of rarity, which only ranges from 3-9 to 4°9. When one remembers that the figures
are not taken directly from facts, but from estimates, of observation, this regularity

is wonderful, and the regular order and progression of the figures goes to show that it
cannot be accidental.

From these and other facts one may reasonably, it seems to me, conclude that in
the peopling of Ceylon with flowering plants the first species to appear, whether coming
from elsewhere or developed for the first time within the island—then probably still
