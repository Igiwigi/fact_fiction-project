512 LORD OXMANTOWN ON THE REFLECTING TELESCOPE,

There are here also some points which it is necessary to attend to. The perfect union
of the plates with the brass speculum depends upon the fact, that if a plate of Specu-
lum metal, scraped as directed, is Jaid upon a clean surface of tinned brass, and the
temperature raised a little beyond the fusing point of tin, and then melted resin and
tin applied, the plate of speculum metal will be immediately tinned all over, and
the union of course will be perfect. If resin, however, is applied at the beginning of
the process, and therefore exposed for hours to an increasing temperature, the resin,
before the temperature has reached the proper degree, will have been decomposed, and
will effectually prevent the snccess of the operation. In my earliest experiments, I
was not aware of this fact, and was therefore obliged to turn the plates over repeatedly
with a wooden tongs, to remove the decomposed resin ; and, although where the plates
were small this was practicable, in attempting to manage the plates of the three-feet
speculum I failed: several were broken by unavoidable exposure to variation of
temperature. I may perhaps as well mention, that formerly I tried the muriate of
ammonia instead of resin, and also a variety of other processes, but none was com-
pletely successful but the one I have given. The resin should not only be in fusion,
but, where the plates are large it is more prudent to regulate the temperature by a
thermometer. 'The same observation applies to the tin; I have found, however, that
a portion of unmelted tin in the ladle, in contact with the fluid metal, was a sufficient
guarantee against a too great disparity of temperature. The brick work should be
perfectly dry, as a drop of condensed steam falling upon a plate would certainly
crack it.
