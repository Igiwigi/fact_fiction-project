described in the sequel have been made without assistance). The experiments which I
$hall communicate prove that, by means of this apparatus, the specific heat‚Äù of solid
8ubstances, even when only small quantities are taken (in most cases I worked with
only a few grammes), may be determined with an accuracy not much less than that
attained with larger quantities in more complicated processes.

19. Yet, it is true, the accuracy of the results obtained by this process appears to be
inferior to that attainable by the use of N&UMANnN's or of REGxSauLT's methods. I have
investigated many substances, determinations of which haye also been made by these
physicists. I do not find that the numbers I have obtained deviate in one special direc-
tion from those which these physicists have found, which moreover sometimes differ
considerably among themselves* ; but that the certainty of the results I have obtained is
less, is sRown by the fact that the results of different experiments with the same substance
agree less closely with one another than do those 'of ReGxavir and of NEUMANN.

That my determinations are less accurate is probably least due to the circumstance
that IT did not use certain corrections, for instance, that 1 did not allow for the loss of
heat in the calorimeter between the time when the heated body was immersed and the
maximum temperature was attained f. I have endeayoured to diminish the uncer-
tainty of the results from this source by having the temperature of the water in the calori-
meter, before immersing the heated body, somewhat lower than that of the surrounding
air. TI have endeavoured to ensure comparability in my results for different substances
by always operating as much as possible under the same cireumstances; that is, T
endeavoured always to produce in the water of the calorimeter the same excess of
temperature over that of the surrounding air. Without depreciating the interest and
