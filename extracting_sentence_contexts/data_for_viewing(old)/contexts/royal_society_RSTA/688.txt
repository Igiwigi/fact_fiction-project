incorporation, direct copying is universally abhorred. Copying ‘steals’; it speaks to a lack of
creativity, a lack of integrity and an intent to defraud. Perhaps the worst criticism that an artist
or architect can receive is to be called derivative. Some of the world’s greatest cons were had
at the hands of art counterfeiters; as in the case of Han van Meegeren, whose greatest forgery

somewhat at the expense of artistic pride: it highlights the shame of being fooled by someone
who has not employed creativity in the content of the work, but in the attempt to pass the work
of as someone else’s.

Here again, science differs from art. For a scientist, there is no need to reinvent the wheel, as it
were, when it comes to, for example, using formulae, processes, or other established concepts. In
fact, this is the foundation of science. Scientists cite the work of other scientists with no emotion
attached. Even when we look to the field of biomimetics, direct copying of nature is seen as a high :
ideal—creating nature’s work in a laboratory is not only a worthy pursuit, it is one that is highly =
coveted. This is a concept that might be foreign, if not distasteful, to contemporary artists. 3
