As the separation is incomplete, all turbulence spectra retain a prominent peak at the aed
energy-containing wave frequency. This general form led Lumley & Terray [21] to conclude that 22
turbulence velocity spectra in the ocean surface layer could be understood without recourse [4
to the dynamics. The kinematics, however, could not explain the more important fact that the : =
turbulent velocity spectra measured beneath the wind waves show a large enhancement about the : z
central wave frequency with an apparent increase in spectral density at high frequencies. This not [8

too subtle enhancement of the spectral density is the true consequence of dynamic interactions,
as in the wave-induced modulations discussed by Huang ef al. [22]. Limited by the separation
method employed here, their conclusions for the study, though of critical importance, could only
be regarded as questionable.
