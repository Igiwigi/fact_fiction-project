An
example of this is represented in fig. 26, It will be asked in this case if the dark-
bordered fibre exhibits an axis-cylinder quite up to the ganglion-cell. I have s8een a
distinct and very fine axis-cylinder, in the case of some old cells in the ganglia on the

A posterior roots of the nerves in the frog, within three thousandths of an inch of the gan-
JD glion-cell ; but nearer to the cell the s0-called axis-cylinder seems not to be distinct from
S the material of which the white substance is composed, as I have shown to be the cage
& in all dark-bordered fibres near their distribution. In fact the distinction of a fibre into
& white substance and axis-cylinder is only to be demonstrated in nerve-fibres which have
'Â® been developed for a very considerable period of time; and wherever this distinction is
& obgerved, we may be sure that the nerve-fibre is of considerable age.
= As a general rule the straight fibre is thicker than the spiral fibres, and there is no
ie difficulty in obtaining specimens in which the dark-bordered fibre can be traced on as
5 the straight fibre of the ganglion-cell. The spiral fibres are often very fine, and are con-
-2 nected together here and there. Sometimes several unite to form one very fine fibre,
E which can be followed for some distance upon, and very close to, the outer part of a
5 5 wide dark-bordered fibre.
