contains a good deal of pepsin, but I believe this to be due simply to the zymogen being more easily split
up in these glands than in others. Tt will be remembered that the granules of the © chief ” cells which
probably consist in part or wholly of zymogen are not preseryed by osmic acid; 7.e., these zymogen
granules split up with osmic acid, whilst the other zymogen granules we know of do not. Further, as
| mentioned above, EpsTEix and GRiTzNeR have shown that the gastric glands of Mammals do contain

8ome zZymogen.

The general course of reasoning given above, led me to make some direct experi-
| ments on the subject. The result completely confirmed the justice of the deductions
& drawn from microscopical examination. Since I propose to discuss in a later paper
a the whole question of the formation of pre-products by gland-cells, I will here only
S briefly mention the main facts which show that zymogen and not ferment is stored up
& by the glands we are considering.
= Tf the cesophagus or stomach of a Frog be placed in glycerine as rapidly as possible
© after removal from the body, the glycerine extract has only a weak peptic power.

S If the eesophagus or stomach of a Frog be kept moist for twenty-four hours before
S it is placed in glycerine, the glycerine extract has a very much greater peptic power.
= Tf the cesophagus and stomach which has been extracted with, say, 5 cub. centims. of
2 glycerine for a week be washed free of glycerine and treated with 5 cub. centims. of
S dilute hydrochloric acid, then an enormously greater amount of pepsin is found in the
S acid than is found in the glycerine extract.

&= The glycerine extracts increase somewhat, although only slightly, in peptic power
