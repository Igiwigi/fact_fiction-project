bundles of the Lycopods. The nearest approach to this structure that T am acquainted
with amongst the living Lycopodiacee is een in the five- or six-angled bundle of
Psilotum triquetrum; but in this example the central procambium is not converted into
vessels, but into a compact rod of thick-walled, permanent prosenchyma. Some of the
vessels of Psilotum exhibit a remarkable tendency to abandon the scalariform, and
assume an irregularly reticulate type of structure. The bark of this recent plant affords
an instructive instance of the differences between the seyeral parts of a continuous tizsue
destined to live under different conditions and to perform different functions. In the
aerial stem its outer layer consists of long narrow prosenchymatous cells with parallel
8ides. The same tissue in the subterranean axis, now generally regarded as an under-
ground stem rather than as a root, is composed of very large, coarse, thick-walled, irregular

* T have already (page 42, note) called attention to the fact that some species of SphenophyTlum, at least,
exhibit the three superficial grooves of the bark 80 characteristic of young twigs of Asterophylites.

parenchyma. 'The difference between these two tissues is quite as great as that which I
have shown to exist between the corresponding ones of Aserophyllites. In both cases
the narrow prosenchyma of the atrial bark is converted into the modified parenchyma of
the snbterranean one. |

These resemblances to Lycopodiacen are further sustained by the nature of the fructi-
fication. A German critic of my memoir on Volkmannia Dawsoni objected to my
