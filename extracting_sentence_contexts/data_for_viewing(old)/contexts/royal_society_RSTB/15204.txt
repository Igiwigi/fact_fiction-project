Brain tissue isolated from postnatal (P4), juvenile (P21) and adult inhibitor (Santa Cruz sc-204170; 1 pM)) for 1 day.

(P60) Pdgfra:Cre-RCE:loxP-GFP mice was dissociated to single
cells with neural (for postnatal) and adult (for juvenile and
adult) tissue dissociation kits (P; Miltenyi Biotec) without the A . ‘
red blood cell removal step. Cell suspensions were then filtered (h) PADI2B overexpression and silencing
with a 30 mm filter (Partec). For OPC removal from OL lineage
cells from juvenile and adult brains, CD140a (anti-mouse
CD140 APC conjugated, BD Bioscience) labelling was performed.
GFP-+ cells from postnatal brains and GFP+/CD140a- cells from
juvenile and adult brains were isolated with fluorescence-
activated cell sorting (FACS) using a BD FACSAria III Cell
Sorter B5/R3/V3 system. Sorted cells were collected in Eppen-
dorf tubes, centrifuged at 400g, resuspended in Qiazol and
stored at —80°C until RNA extraction/cDNA synthesis.

PADI2£ and control overexpression cell lines were generated by
insertion of the following vectors with piggyBac transposon
system: pB-CAG-Ctr, pB-CAG-PADI28 for the control and overex-
pression of PADI2{, respectively; the gateway system was used to
clone these vectors in the final piggyback plasmids (Gateway LR
Clonase II Enzyme mix, Invitrogen/ThermosFisher Scientific,
11791020). pB-CAG-Ctr, pB-CAG-PADI26 were transfected
together with piggyBac transposase (pBase) expression vector by
