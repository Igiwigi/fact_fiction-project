would in fact be constant, the forcive on each element of the conductor being wholly
at right angles to it. The general case when the currents are not linear is also amenable to simp
analysis. ‘The energy associated with any linear element ids is ids{Mids’; which is
equal to ds multiplied by the component of the vector-potential of the currents in
the direction of ds, when the conducticn and convection currents move round
complete circuits. Thus, changing our notation, the energy associated with a curre
(u, v, w) in an element of volume dr is (Fu + Gv + Hw) dr.
