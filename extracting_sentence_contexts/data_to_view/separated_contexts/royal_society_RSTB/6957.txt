In each instance we have tentatively identified this peat layer which directly overlies the
trackways as indicative of the early stages of swamping. At the Westhay trackway similarly there are 20 cm. of aquatic Sphagnum peat and dense
Eriophorum beneath the Cladium layer and overlying the trackway. These facts suggest at once: (a) that the effects of the climatic degeneration were already
evident before the opening of zone VIII; (4) that they were felt only in certain sites;
(c) that where they were felt the prehistoric trackways mark their presence.

At Westhay trackway (figure 26, part IX) there is even an indication of the onset
of wetter conditions some 25 cm. beneath the base of the prehistoric trackway. In the Shapwick Heath DB 3 pollen diagram (figure 5, part VIII) although there was
no evidence of earlier flooding of the bog surface there, at 200 cm. was drawn in the base
of zone VII-VIII, which we had delimited as a zone transitional between the Sub-Boreal
and Sub-Atlantic, and established chiefly by comparison with the Fenlands and with
Shropshire.
