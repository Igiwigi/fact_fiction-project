The solution for the reflected wave, which is obtained by changing the sign of b,
in the solution already discussed, must be small in the neighbourhood of FresnEL’s
diffraction phenomena, and it will have no appreciable effect upon the rapid alterations
of intensity in that neighbourhood.

Let us assume that the edges A and B (fig. 1) of the two semi-infinite planes are joined
by a plane face, so that we have in effect a thick semi-infinite plane. It is then apparent
that the waves, which would otherwise have entered the space between the planes,
will now be scattered by the face AB. The effect of these scattered waves may con-
fidently be assumed to be negligible in the region under consideration.

When we consider the problem of the diffraction of light by a straight edge, we picture
the latter as the edge of a thin sheet of metal, ignoring the fact that the thickness of
the sheet is probably great when expressed in terms of wave-length of the incident light.
Observation and also theory. as we have just seen, indicate that the thickness does not
essentially affect the phenomena of diffraction in the neighbourhood of the shadow at
points sufliciently distant from the straight edge, that is at points where those phenomena
are usually observed.

But there is one other important point to notice.

The geometrical shadow has so far been defined as the locus $ — %o ==.

Let us consider perpendicular incidence, in which case %) = 3x. Then $, = jr,
defines the geometrical shadow. In this case let P (fig. 1) be a point upon the geo-
