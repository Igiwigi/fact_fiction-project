use of U-Pb crystallization ages and Hf-depleted mantle model ages, and Dhuime et al. [11] added
data screening with oxygen isotope data. More recently, Korenaga [36] suggested a new method
of estimating the formation ages from U-Pb crystallization ages and Hf model ages, by taking into
account the covariation of these two different ages.


However, the period from 2010 to 2017, i.e. after the publication of Belousova et al. [35] and
before that of Korenaga [36], was singularly confusing, and it deserves some detailed account.
First of all, as demonstrated by Korenaga [36], the method proposed by Belousova et al. [35] does
not produce an estimate on formation age distribution. There is no logical connection between
the formation age distribution and the mathematical operation conducted in their method, and
any ‘growth-curve-looking’ result from their method is better regarded as a procedural artefact.
This fact was already hinted by one of the two synthetic tests conducted by Belousova et al. [35]
themselves (see section 5.2 of [36]) and was also alluded by Payne et al. [48]. Dhuime et al. [11]
incorporated oxygen isotope screening, but the core of the method remained the same in their
application. They also introduced an additional layer of confusion; they regarded their ‘growth
curve’ as an estimate on net crustal growth, not on the formation age distribution. That is,
they seemed to think that they could correct not only for crustal reworking but also for crustal

recycling. This fact may not be very obvious in their paper; in their fig. 2, they denote their growth : =
curve as ‘crustal reworking corrected’ (a tag appropriate for the formation age distribution), but : S
in the main text, they use this curve to discuss ‘net rates of continental growth’. A series of review 2
papers written subsequently by the same authors [20,21,49,50] has made it clear that they do : &
