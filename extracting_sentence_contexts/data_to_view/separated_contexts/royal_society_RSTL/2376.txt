If, therefore, an ton pass towards one of the electrodes, another ion must
also be passing simultaneously to the other electrode, although, from secondary action,
it may not make its appearance (748.).

829. iv. A body decomposable directly by the electric current, i. e. an electrolyte,
must consist of two 7ons, and must also render them up during the act of decompo-
Sition,

830. y. There is but one electrolyte composed of the same two elementary tons; at
least such appears to be the fact (697.), dependent upon a law, that only single electro-
chemical equivalents of elementary ions can go to the electrodes, and not multiples.

831. vi. A body not decomposable when alone, as boracic acid, is not directly de-
composable by the electric current when in combination (780.). It may act as an
70n, going wholly to the anode or cathode, but does not yield up its elements, except
occasionally by a secondary action.
