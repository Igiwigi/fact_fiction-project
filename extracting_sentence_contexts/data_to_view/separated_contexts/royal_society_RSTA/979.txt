The nickel steels of more or less high percentage, depending on their content of
carbon, manganese, or other additional element, undergo a permanent transformation
at low temperatures. This, however, does not destroy the beneficial effect of the
nickel. The alloy K mentioned above was, in fact, such a steel, being non-magnetic
before immersion in liquid air and strongly magnetic on return to normal temperatures. A similar remark applies to specimen 1449A, fig. 6, Plate 7, in the Hadfield research,
containing 0-70% carbon, 0-82% manganese, and 31 4% nickel.
