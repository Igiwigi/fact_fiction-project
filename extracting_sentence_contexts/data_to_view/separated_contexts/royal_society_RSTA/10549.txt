The relation of residual magnetic intensity to dimension ratio. It was also shown, and it can be seen from the table and diagram, that a rise of
temperature in the cyclic state increases the magnetic intensity, and a fall of
temperature diminishes it in the case of a magnet of large dimension ratio constructed
of drawn steel of the kind supplied for pianofortes,* an effect contrary to what is
ordinarily observed. The results of these experiments, and of others which need not here be introduced,
upon a number of steels of different chemical composition, as well as the fact that
stretching simply does not produce any marked change in the temperature coefficient,
strengthen the conjecture that the abnormal effect is due to repeated drawing.

* Knitting needle and pinion wires do not yield this effect, as they are treated differently to music wire
in the process of drawing.
