mately bound up with the vascular system, is designed to supply a fluid secretion, from
the blood-proper, which is necessary to the further growth of the generative produets. This illustration confirms what has been constantly observed during the foregoing
descriptions, that the blodd-proper system in the Annelids is much more intimately
connected with the process and the organs of reproduction than the chylaqueous fluid,
This important fact implies evidently a difference of vital and chemical compoxition in
these two fluids. The higher fluid is used for a higher purpose, the lower for a lower. The segmental organs in the Ariciadz occupy the floor of each annular compartment
