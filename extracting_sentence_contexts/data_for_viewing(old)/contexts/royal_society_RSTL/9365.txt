but fundamental. The whole vibrating system seems to haye been altered ; and there
is at present, in the yas majority of cases, no hope that we may consider the vibra-
tions of a molecule to be only the slightly disburbed vibrations of the atoms. We
have now a second cause for a change in the different orders of spectra. We need no
more look on a continuous spectrum as a line spectrum, disburbed by the shocks of
other molecules ; but we may explain it by the changes which have taken place in the
individual molecule.

According to this view, liquid and solid bodies give generally continuous spectra,
not because they are liquid or solid, but because in these states the molecules have a
more complicated structure than in the gaseous state. Experiment has to deeide
between the two theories : the theory of molecular disturbance, and the theory of mole-
cular structure. I think that the facts are decidedly in favour of the latter theory.
Mr. Lockvyer's investigations have shown that most bodies give us a continuous spec-
trum, as a gas, before they condense, and many at a considerable temperature above
the boiling point. Mr. Lockyer has rightly drawn the conclusion from these facts,
that the atomic aggregation of the molecules is the canse of the different orders of
spectra. If we observe the changes in a spectrum which gradually take place on
heating or cooling a vapour, we find that the continuous spectrum is produced, not by
a widening of the bands, but by a direct replacement, which is 80metimes sudden and
sometimes gradual, and which leaves no doubt in the observer's mind that he has to
deal with two vibrating systems, and not simply with a disturbed one. I do not, of
course, mean to say that the impacts of other molecules have no observable influence.
If the hydrogen lines widen through increased pressure, it is very likely that the
alteration is produced by impacts ; but the change from a line spectrum to a con-
