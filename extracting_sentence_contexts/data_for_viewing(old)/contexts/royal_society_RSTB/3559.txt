(b) Ganglionic Anlugen.

e

The lateral lobes, which at first sight look as if they were alar expansions of the
lateral edges of the medullary plate, are in reality covered over by thin ectoderm.
This is continuous with the thick ectoderm of the medullary plate, along a line which
is indeed not readily apparent in the photomicrographs, but which is the direct
prolongation of the edge of the medullary plate in front of, and behind, the apparent
interruption of that edge.

Nevertheless the serial sections show that the apparent continuity of the medullary
plate with these lobate expansions at the sides of it is no mere fiction, but an
expression of a genuine structural continuity between the deeper part of the edge of
the thick medullary plate on the one hand, and the tissue of the subectodermal
cellular plate, which constitutes the lobe in question, on the other hand. From its
connections and relations there can be no doubt that this extensive, lobate, cellular,
lamella is ganglionic in character ; nor can there be any hesitation in identifying it
with the primitive ganglion of the Trigeminus.

Further consideration of figs. 73 and 74 will show that what we have identified as
the trigeminal ganglionicplate does not standalone asa ganglionic rudiment in the head.
Behind it, and opposite the anterior region of the hind-brain, there is to be seen, at
the outer side of the lateral border of the medullary plate, a patch, dark by trans-
mitted (fig. 74), and light by reflected (fig. 73), light. This we have ascertained
