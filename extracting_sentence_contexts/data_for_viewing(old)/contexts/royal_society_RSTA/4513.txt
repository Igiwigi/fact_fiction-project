entropy, Fisher permutation information measure and permutation MPR statistical complexity. Of
course, the embedding dimension D plays an important role in the evaluation of the appropriate
probability distribution because D determines the number of accessible states D! and also
conditions the minimum acceptable length M > D! of the time series that one needs in order
to work with reliable statistics [39].

Regarding the selection of the parameters, Bandt & Pompe suggested working with 4<
D <6 and specifically considered an embedding delay t =1 in their cornerstone paper [15].
Nevertheless, it is clear that other values of t could provide additional information. It has been
shown recently that this parameter is strongly related, if it is relevant, to the intrinsic time scales
of the system under analysis [43-45].

The local sensitivity of Fisher information measure for discrete PDFs is reflected in the fact
that the specific ‘i ordering’ of the discrete values p; must be seriously taken into account in
evaluating the sum in equation (3.5) [18,19]. The pertinent numerator can be regarded as a kind
of ‘distance’ between two contiguous probabilities. Thus, a different ordering of the pertinent
summands would lead to a different Fisher information value. In fact, if we have a discrete PDF
given by P = {p;,i=1,...,N} we will have N! possibilities for the i ordering.



The question is, which is the arrangement that one could regard as the ‘proper’ ordering?
The answer is straightforward in some cases, a histogram-based PDF constituting a conspicuous
example. For such a procedure, one first divides the interval [a,b] (with a and b the minimum
and maximum amplitude values in the time series, respectively) into a finite number of non-
