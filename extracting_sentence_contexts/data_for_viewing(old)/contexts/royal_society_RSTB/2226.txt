Coarse irritation of the cortex with an electrical current cannot be regarded as
doing otherwise than altering the nutrition of the cortical cells in a downward
direction, and yet the effect of prolonged subminimal excitation is a condition of
increased excitability (bE Vartanyt).

In regard to toxic agents, nearly all substances produce, first, exaltation, and then
paralysis of cerebral functions. Alcohols and anesthetics produce this result.
Morphia{ in certain doses may exaggerate both cortical and reflex excitability in
dogs, although. the animals are, on the sensory side, brought by this drug into the
condition of decerebrate animals. The convulsants cicutin, strychnine, cocaine,§
picrotoxin, cinchonidin,|| acid sodium phosphate, and absinthe in small doses produce
convulsion, and in larger doses paralysis. The fact that aneesthetics stop the action
of convulsants shows that convulsions arise from the first stage and anesthesia or
paralysis from the second stage of disordered cerebral metabolism. This is borne out
by the fact that after a convulsant has been administered a far less quantity of the

aneesthetic agent is required to produce anvesthesia. There is no need to multiply
further examples of the fact that hyper-excitability is, as a rule, the first result of a
downward alteration of the metabolism of the nerve centres. The higher function of
the brain is not excitability (Actionscapacitiit), but resistance to impulsive action
(Actionswiderstand), and it is the latter which is the first to fail when nutrition
becomes disordered. To put it in other words, ‘ Bahnung” then becomes easy, while
“ Hemmung” fails. It is then to be expected that a stage of hyper-excitability
would be found to precede paralysis when the cortex is rendered anzemic. Never-
