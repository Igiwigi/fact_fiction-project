In two examples of Rotalia Beccarii (Liyn.) the same process occurred. Th
parent in each case was microspheric. The fact that the whole of the protoplasm of the parent is used in the production
of the young, and that these are all of one form, supports the view that the two
forms of the Foraminifera belong to different generations. A fuller account of the process of reproduction, with what I am able to make out
of the nuclear changes, will be reserved for another paper. List or Works REFERRED â€˜0.
