of two terms Aâ€”B. The new one has its wave-numbers of the form A+B. In other
words, where the old series are difference frequencies the new ones are the corre-
sponding summation frequencies. The notation adopted is to write the corresponding
terms in Clarendon type. Thus

The list of the lines in X is given on p. 385 up to m = 30. For low orders, m < 3,
the lines are in the ultra-violet and have to be sounded for. Similar summation
series coupled with other F series age also common. It probably explains also the
crowding of F separations in spectra like that of Cu in short wave regions far beyond
the F limit which has always appealed to me as a difficulty. It is possible that
summation series may also exist for the P.S.D. series in all elements, but, as a rule,
the limits of these are far larger than the F(), with the consequence that any
P.S.D. lines must lie very far in the ultra-violet, a fact which explains why such types
if existing have not hitherto been recognised. The existence of these summation
series is thoroughly established and their importance as bearing on theories of the
origin of spectral lines is evident. They would seem difficult to explain on any of the
current theories. But apart from this the existence of the type is of great value for
quantitative determinations. This is fully dealt with on p. 384 and it need not be
recapitulated here. Its importance for this purpose may be realised when it is seen
that it forms the starting point in the analysis of the RaEm spectrum, that it settles
in a quite definite way a difficulty arising in the evaluation of the oun in Kr, and
that it fixes a very accurate value for the limit of the 1864 series in X, thus
simultaneously fixing a particular d sequent subject only to observation error in one
line.
