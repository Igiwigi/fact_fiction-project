But the attraction of aggregation seems to be susceptible of
various modifications, which alter its manner of acting upon the
constituent molecules. Of these: modifications there are two
principal ones ; the first of which may, I think, be distinguished
by the name of crystalline attraction of aggregation; the second
may be called simple attraction of aggregation.

The erystalline attraction of aggregation always takes place
between similar molecules; which molecules are simple or pri-
mitive, in those bodies which are considered as simple or
primitive, (and which in fact are 80,) and they are compound
in other bodies. This kind of attraction, in its action upon the
molecules under its influence, is either regular, irregular, or
amorphous.

In the regular crystalline attraction of aggregation, the mo-
lecules arrange themselves in such a way as to give rise to solid
bodies, which are either constantly of the same form, or are
subject to certain laws of variation ; these variations, however,
