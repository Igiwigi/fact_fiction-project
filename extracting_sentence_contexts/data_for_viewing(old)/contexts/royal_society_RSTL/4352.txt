on the addition of salts of copper. The same precipitates are obtained from the
neutralized as from the acid s0lution. Such were the preliminary observations made
on repeating DoBEREINER's experiment.

One important fact was observyed in this preliminary trial, viz. that nitric oxide
disappeared during the action, and in fact only occurred when the transformation
was 80 violent as to escape control. This gas was therefore probably one important
cause of the change, and it therefore became necessary to examine its action on the
cyanides, as a more simple means of eliciting its mode of action.

3. The first obvious experiment was to ascertain whether cyanide of potassium
charged with nitric oxide would produce prussides exerting the remarkable colouring
action on the sulphides. Nitric oxide is in fact readily absorbed by cyanide of potas-
Sum, the solution becoming red-coloured and depositing a black substance resem-
bling paracyanogen. This red-coloured solution did not of itself give any colour
when mixed with a sulphide. It was now converted into a prusside by the addition
of protosulphate of iron. The resulting prusside was now found to strike a magnifi-
cent purple colour with a soluble sulphide. The same coloration was obtained when
a prusside was made from common cyanide of potassium added to a solution of pro-
tosulphate of iron, through which nitric oxide had been passed. It was obvious from
these experiments that nitric oxide was one of the great causes of the change experi-
enced by the prusside.

4. The action of nitric oxide on the prussides themselves was now examined. Tt
was found that nitric oxide could be passed through a solution of ferrocyanide of
