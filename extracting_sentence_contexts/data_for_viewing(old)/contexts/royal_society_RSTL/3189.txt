would be equal at all points similarly situated with respect to the line just mentioned
through the centres of the sun and earth. If the interior surface of the shell be sphe-
roidal, but of small eccentricity, very nearly the same effect will be produced. The
pressure in this case will be exactly equal at points similarly situated with respect to
a plane through the sun and the axis of rotation (A P) of the shell, and will conse-
quently tend to communicate a rotatory motion to the shell about an axis perpen-
dicular to this plane and through the earth's centre; 7.e. about the same axis as that
about which the attraction mentioned in (I.) tends to communicate a rotatory motion.
Als the effects of this pressure must recur with recurring positions of the sun exactly
in the same manner as the effects of the sun's attraction just alluded to. Hence the
terms depending on this cause will be of the same form as those in (I.), as will, in
fact, be proved to be the case when we come to investigate their exact value. They
will, therefore, give us

IV. The Interior Pressure on the Shell from the Attraction of the Moon on the Fluid
Mass.—This will give us terms similar to those arising from the sun's action. From
this cause alone, therefore, we should have
