roots so far available. They are g = — 10-438, h = 27-220. It follows that the corresponding
latent roots, say A, and A,, are approximately

Ay Ap = H- EA (GB—4h)} = 5:35, 5-08.

Their near-equality appears to the computer as an explanation of his former suspicions.
Intending to reconsider 4, and A, at the stage of fine purification, and mindful of the precept
that it is desirable to locate all the latent roots roughly before seeking any of them accurately,
the computer now attends to A, and A,. Their sum is 12—A,—A, = 12 +g = 1-56, or there-
abouts. To find them separately he first prepares a column free from the associates of Ay
and A,. As raw material the computer chooses, just from habit, {1,1, 1,1} = Y0, say. As a
matter of fact this is a very bad choice, but of course the computer could not know that.
The method will rescue him. The appropriate purifier is (K—A,J) (K—A,J); and this, to
the best of his information, equals K?-+gK +-AI. Accordingly he works out

(K?—10-44K +.27-22/) Yo = {—4-30, —1-18, 4-58, 2-82} = Yi, say.

Because g and h are only approximations to —A,—A, and A, A; respectively, a second puri-
fication is desirable, using the same premultiplier, and retaining all digits. It is found that

(K?— 10-44K + 27-22/) Yi = Y2, say = {— 104-4732, — 19-2540, 106-8708, 103-2804}.
