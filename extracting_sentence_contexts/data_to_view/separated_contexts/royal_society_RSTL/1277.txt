the experiments with the same care will arrive at the same
results, we $hall rest satisfied with stating the facts, not with-

which have already given us new views of the operations of
nature, will in their progress furnish us with that explanation
which it is in vain to expect at present. Azote or nitrogen, for instance, has been considered as a
