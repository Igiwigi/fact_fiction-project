which it would seem, that he had: not heated his iron to a
sufficient degree to detect the non-action at the white heat.

Notwithstanding therefore all the experiments that have
been made, it is pretty evident from the above remarks, that
considerable uncertainty still hangs over the results; arising,
without doubt, from the want of proper conveniences for heat-
ing bars of sufficient size, and to a proper degree of intensity,


120 Mr. BarLow on the anomalous magnetic action

whereby one author has noticed one fact, and another a difte-
rent one, without being aware how much depended upon a
very slight change in the temperature of the iron.

On these grounds therefore it is presumed, that the: fol-
lowing experiments would be entitled to some notice, as they
serve to reconcile all these apparently contradictory state-
ments ; but the principal reason which has induced me to lay
them before the Royal Society is; the anomalous action which
they have been the means of discovering, while the iron
passes through the shades of bright red and red, already
alluded to in the preceding part of this paper, and which, to
the best of my knowledge, has never been noticed by any
