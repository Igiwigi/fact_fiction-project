This new measurement, as a new
event, even if one measures the same variable, makes the previous expectation-catalog, defined

observed pertain to two mutually exclusive sets of discrete phenomena observed in instruments and not to any continuous
phenomena or any continuous reality ultimately responsible for quantum phenomena. As an RWR-type reality, however, the
reality ultimately responsible for quantum phenomena cannot be assumed to be discrete either.


by a previous measurement, My, at time t; (which could have been used for predicting outcomes
of Mz), meaningless as concerns any prediction after M2 is made. It is true that our decision which measurement to perform only establishes a possible future
course of reality, because, while we can control the set-up of the experiment, we cannot control
the outcome, which fact also gives the measurement objectivity, enabling quantum physics to
conform to the requirements of physics as a mathematical-experimental science. Nevertheless, we
always have freedom, or, again, a sufficient freedom to make this choice or to change our choice
and thus a future course of reality, as opposed to, as in classical physics or relativity, follow what is
bound to happen in any event, regardless of our decision of what to do. There, such a decision can
only affect what part of a pre-existing reality we would know.
