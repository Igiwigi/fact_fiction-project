in accordance with
our previous hypothesis, to the alternate exhaustion and recovery of the excitable
tissnes ? This much, at least, must be allowed even by the most cautious of critics,
viz. : that if, as current views respecting the theory of rhythm would suppose, it is
exclusively the ganglionic element which in the unmutilated Aurelia causes the
rhythm of the swimming-motions by intermittent stimulation, surely it becomes
a most unexpected and unaccountable fact, that after the remoyal of this element
the contractile tissues should still persis in their display of rhythm under the
influence of constant stimulation. At any rate, no one, I think, will dispute that the

* Tt will not be forgotten that there are a multitude of ganglion-cells distributed throughout the
contractile tissnes of the Meduse, but forasmnch as these are comparatively rarely instramental in
originating stimulation, I think it is probable that artificial stimulation acts directly on the contractile
tissues, and not through the medinm of these xcattered cells. MR. G. 5, ROMANES ON THE LOCOMOTOR SYSTEM OF MEDUSM.
