CHAMBERS ON LUNI-SOLAR VARIATIONS OF

21. The numbers of Table 26 are curved in dotted lines in fig. 48. The ‘general
correspondence of fact, as indicated by the thin-line curve, with our formula, as
indicated by the dotted curves, cannot fail to arrest the attention of the reader ; and,
whatever be the physical conditions lying behind the phenomena, it cannot but be
helpful towards their discovery that a compact mental grasp of the phenomena, such
as the formula affords, should take the place of such notions of disconnected variations
as are the first outcome of a study of the observations.

22. The numbers of Table 27 are curved in dotted lines in fig. 49, and on the same
form are curved, in thin lines, the observed lunar diurnal variations of horizontal
force, taken from Column 2 of Tables 5 to 8, for each of the eight phases of the moon. Here again the comparison of observation, as indicated by the thin-line curves, with the
formula, through its representative dotted curves, shows remarkably close agreement.
