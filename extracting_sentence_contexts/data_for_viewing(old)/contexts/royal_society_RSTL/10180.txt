the most important mineral constituents that would be removed from an acre of fair
average pasture and arable land, in animal increase and in some other products, may be
compared. Such estimates can obviously be only approximate, and the quantities will
be 8ubject to considerable range of variation. Taking them as such, it may be stated
in general terms thatâ€”of phosphoric acid an acre would lose more in milk, and four
or five times as much in wheat or barley grain, or in hay, as in the fattening increase
of oxen or sheep. Of lime the land would lose about twice as much in the animal in-
crease as in milk, or as in wheat or barley grain, but, perhaps, nob more than one-tenth
as much as in hay. Lastly, of potash an acre would yield only a fraction of a pound
in animal increase, six or eight times as much in milk, perhaps twenty or thirty times
as much in wheat or barley grain, and more than one hundred times as much in hay.

The loss to the land in the animal increase is, in fact, chiefly in phosphate of lime,
in amount varying from 5 to 10 lbs. per acre. In milk the loss is higher in phos-
Phorie acid, less in lime, and more in potash. In wheat and barley grain the Joss

of phosphoric acid is several times as great, and it is chiefly as phosphate of potagh ;
whilst in hay the loss in phosphorie acid is much the same as in wheat or barley grain,
but that of both lime and potash is very much greater than in any of the other
products.

It is freely granted that the results which have been brought forward are calculated
