if a thorough account is required of the work that has been carried out on the structure
of cellulose, fibroin, chitin, ete. The properties of hair and the type of the X-ray photo-
graphs which have been described above do not offer us any sufficient reason to doubt
that the animal fibres so far examined must possess certain fundamental features
analogous to those of the vegetable fibres discussed elsewhere. Whatever may be the
constitution of the keratins as a class, we are justified by the experimental results now
before us in assuming as a sound working hypothesis that keratin fibres, like cellulose
fibres, owe many of their properties to the repetition along the fibre of comparatively
simple units to form molecular chains.

The molecular chains of cellulose and chitin* are believed to be based on the formule
(a) and (b), respectively. But we have an additional purpose in quoting these two par-
ticular chains, and that is, to draw attention to the fact that, in both, the length of the
