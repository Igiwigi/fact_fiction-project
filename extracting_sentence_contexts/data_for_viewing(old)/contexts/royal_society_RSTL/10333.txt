my investigation of the structure of pulvini. This work was commenced in the
Wirzburg laboratory in the month of July, 1882, under the direction, and at the
8uggestion, of Professor SAons.

I studied in detail the pulyini of Mimosa pudica, Robinia pseudacacia, Amicia

* Seo Rus80w's observations on Abies Picta, *Stzb. d. Dorpat. Naturf. Gesell., 1881, p. 70. Also
STRASBURGER, © Ban und Wachsthum,' p. 60. Rvss0w (* Stzb. d. Dorpat. Naturf. Gesell.,' Feb. 17th, 1882),
like myself, in contradistinction to Jaxozewsx1 (* Mem. de la Soc. des Sc. Nat. et Math. de Cherbourg.,”
vol. xxxiii., p. 209, 1882), believes that the reactions of callus point essentially to its protoplasmic nature.

f T find in reality that the aboye reaction of the pit membrane with methylene blue takes place in
consequence of the fact that the membrane is more resistant than the rest of the cell-wall. Whether
this is in consequence of the presence of protoplasm in its structure remains to be proved. This
STRASBURGER also found to be the cage. See © Ban und Wachsthum,” P- 16.

2ygomerts, and Phaseolus multiflorus. I do nob intend in the present paper to enter
into any diseussion with regard either to the nature of irritability or the phenomena
of movement of which these plants serve as illustrations, but merely to contine myself
to such structural detail as is necessary for the clear comprehension and Significance
of my results. The principal literature of the subject has been collated by Prerren,*
to whose researches and those of Sacnst we owe the greater part of our knowledge of
