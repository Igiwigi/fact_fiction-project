immediate after-effects.

We are not at present in a position to discuss the snbsequent after-effects, which
we reserve until we shall have investigated the course of electrotonic and post-
electrotonic changes. We cannot, however, omit drawing attention to the peculiarity
affecting the opening excitation, which constitutes an exception to the rule that the
subsequent after-effect of polarisation of either sign is increased excitability. The
subsequent after-effect of anodic polarization as tested by anodic break is apparently
diminished excitability, yet by testing in the polar region by kathodic make, evidence
of increased excitability is obtained when the effect of the original anodic break may
be almost lost. To what specific difference in the excitatory process at make and ab
break this may point we cannot conjecture, and we have only to remark that the
fact is of the same nature as the gradual diminution of successive anodic break
contractions.
