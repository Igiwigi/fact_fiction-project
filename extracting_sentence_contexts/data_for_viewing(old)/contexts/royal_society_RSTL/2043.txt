I cannot conclude this memoir without again expressing my entire convic-
tion of its very imperfect character, —I should regret its publication if I sup-
posed it likely that any intelligent person could consider it otherwise than as
an attempt to combine such information as we have, and to point out the want

and the use of more. I shall be neither surprised nor mortified if the lines
which I have drawn shall turn out to be in many instances widely erroneous :
I offer them only as the simplest mode which I can now discover of grouping
the facts which we possess. The lines which occupy the Atlantic, and those
which are near the coasts of Europe, appear to have the greatest degree of
probability. The tides on the coasts of New Zealand and New Holland have
also a consistency which makes them very probable. The Indian Ocean is less
certain ; though it is not easy to see how the course of the lines can be very
widely different from that which we have taken. The course of the lines in the
Pacific appears to be altogether problematical ; and though those which are
drawn in the neighbourhood of the west coast of America connect most of the
best observations, they can hardly be considered as more than conjecture :—in
the middle of the Pacific I have not even ventured to conjecture,

It only remains to add, that I shall be most glad to profit by every opportu-
nity of improving this Map, and will endeayour to employ for this purpose any
