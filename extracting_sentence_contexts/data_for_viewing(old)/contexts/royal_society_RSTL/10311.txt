This sexual difference has been pointed out by Donurx (Zeit. Zool., xxi., 1871, p. 358),
but it seems to have escaped the notice of all other observers.

In the young and in the mature female (fig. 72) the rounded tip projects beyond the
tooth (a), but as the male approaches maturity the outer edge lengthens, thus pushing
the tooth ont, as shown in fig. 73, until the end of the appendage becomes square
instead of rounded. Tb is extremely interesting to notice that in Lucifer, as in 80
many other animals, the adult female is infantile in all the secondary points of
difference Å¿rom the male.

General view of the metamorphosts of Luciter,

A review of the facts which have been described in this section indicates that some
of the changes are much more significant than others, since the number of moults is
much greater than the number of distinet larval type.

The meta-Navuplius is obviously a Nauplius with the rudiments of structures which
are to appear after the moult, and it must therefore be regarded as a Nauplius
prepared for the change into a Protozot, rather than a distinct stage of development.

There is no such break between the firs Protozo#a and the las Zoua as there
is between the firss Protozoa and the Nauplins. The rudimentary pereiopods and
8wimmerets of the 80-called Zota are nothing but a preparation for the next stage of
development, and the 8upposed necessity for finding a stage which can be directly
compared with the Zo#a of the higher Decapods does not justify us in making two
