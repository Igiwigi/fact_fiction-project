transform [7], the sparse time-frequency representation [8,9], the partial differential equation
transform [10,11] and the ensemble EMD (EEMD) [12,13]. They are all aimed at handling non-
stationary signals associated with nonlinear systems. We chose to use MIF because it is easy
to implement, ready to be applied to two-dimensional signals, computationally fast and most
importantly it has been proved to be convergent under mild conditions, at least when applied to
one-dimensional signals.

The other main result of this paper is the development of a pre-processing algorithm, also
based on MIF, which allows us to decorrelate and mean-centre a raw hypercube, enabling us


to use the naive cosine similarity (COS) measure, also known as the spectral angle mapper, as
a classification technique. In fact, thanks to such a pre-processing technique, the COS measure
produces a classification that is always comparable and that sometimes outperforms those
produced by other commonly used classifiers. The advantage of coupling the COS classifier
with the proposed pre-processing method is that in this way there is no need to estimate the
average signature and the covariance matrix of pixels not belonging to the plume, unlike any
other commonly used classification method.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows: in ยง2, we formalize the problem and briefly
review some of the most commonly used classification methods. In ยง3, we introduce the MIF
algorithm as a decomposition algorithm for one and higher dimensional signals. In ยง4, we present
the proposed pre- and post-processing methods based on the MIF algorithm. Their performance
is demonstrated by means of examples in ยง5.
