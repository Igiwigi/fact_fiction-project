With one exception, I found
that the conductivity augmented with the diathermancy. The exception was furnished
by a cube of yery perfect rock-crystal, which conducted slightly better than my cube of
rock-salt. The latter, however, had a very high conductive power ; in fact rock-salt,
calcareous spar, glass, selenite, and alum, stood in my experiments, as regards conducti-
vity, exactly in their order of diathermancy in the experiments of MELLoxt. I have
already adduced considerations which show that the molecules of rock-salt glide with

facility through the ether, but the ease of motion which these molecules enjoy must
facilitate their mutual collision. Their motion, instead of being expended on the ether
which exists between them, and communicated by it to the external ether, is in great
part transferred directly from particle to particle, or in other words, is freely conducted.
