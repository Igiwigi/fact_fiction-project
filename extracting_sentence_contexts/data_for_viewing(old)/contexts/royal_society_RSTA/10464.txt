The fact that the cloud produced in the mixed gases is similar to that produced in


AND CHLORINE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF LIGHT. 107

chlorine alone suggests that in the mixed gases it is the chlorine alone that is
efficient in producing the nuclei, and that the hydrogen is inactive. It might be
expected that the cloud in the mixture might be formed on hydrochloric acid
molecules produced after the illumination. But the cloud-forming nuclei appears
before any hydrochloric acid is formed in measurable quantity, as the following
experiments show. The expansion apparatus was joined to the ordinary insolation
apparatus of fig. 2, and the two illuminated with the same light. The time to
