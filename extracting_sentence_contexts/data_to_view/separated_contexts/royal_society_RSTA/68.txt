Each agent has to choose a strategy so as to minimize a cost
that not only depends on her type, but also on the probability distribution of strategies resulting
from the behaviour of the rest of the population. A Cournotâ€”Nash equilibrium then is a joint
probability distribution of types and strategies with first marginal (given) and second marginal
v (unknown) that is concentrated on cost-minimizing strategies. The difficulty of the problem lies
in the fact that the cost depends on v. For relevant applications, this dependence can be quite
complex, because there may be both attractive (mimetism) and repulsive (congestion) effects in
the cost. Another situation where one looks for joint probabilities (or couplings) is the optimal
transport problem of Monge-Kantorovich.
