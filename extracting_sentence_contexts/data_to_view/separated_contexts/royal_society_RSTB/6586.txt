Here the folding is
very deep, clearly indicating a large submerged area of buried cortex. From the
arrangement of the sulci and the depth of this central area it is reasonable to suggest
that the stem of the gyrus occipito-parietalis superior has pushed back the area
striata in the centre, and that there has been, in consequence, a dorso-medial and a
ventro-lateral displacement of the area striata. Comparing the medial surface in
C.3.R., S.10.R., and §.12.R., it is apparent from the method of branching of the
sulcus retrocalcarinus (20) that the striate cortex is vertically folded and that a
larger extent of the cuneus than usual is occupied by the striate cortex ; in fact,
in C.3.R. the whole of the cuneus is a striate area. In the other members of this
group the area striata is folded in a horizontal direction ; but, although there is
horizontal folding in the concavity of the sulcus lunatus in the three hemispheres
just described, the main axis of folding of the area striata is vertical. This vertical folding of the striate cortex is made use of to institute a separate
group—group 5—to be described subsequently.
