Since t is large, the integral is dominated by small A,,,, hence : s

Thus, the asymptotic winding law for @(f) as f > oo is given by

where N(0,1) denotes the standard Gaussian distribution. We compare this with numerical
simulations in figure 4. In this case, there is a drift of the angle at a linear rate A(t), since the
confinement of the particle causes it to be strongly affected by the point vortex.
