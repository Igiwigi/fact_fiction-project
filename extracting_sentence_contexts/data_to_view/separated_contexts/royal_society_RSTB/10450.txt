In this theory, the primary requisite of conscious perception
is the ability to actively regenerate and sustain neural activity
patterns, with the sets of patterns in circulation at a given
moment being crucial in determining the contents of
consciousness [48,49].

(j) The attention-schema theory

Although it does purport to be a higher-order theory in the
same sense as most others, a related proposal, the so-called
‘attention-schema’ theory, posits that conscious perception
emerges as a result of the brain constructing a perceptual
model of attention [56]. However, the attention-schema theory
diverges from other higher-order theories in centring on the
right superior temporal sulcus and right temporoparietal junc-
tion, rather than frontoparietal areas, as the likely neural locus
of the higher-order representation that gives rise to conscious
perception. This is due to the fact that these areas are known
to be highly engaged during social interaction—in the atten-
tion-schema theory, the same mechanisms that attribute
awareness to other brains are also responsible for attributing
