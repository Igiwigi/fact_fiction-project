constant for stretching of the covalent O-H bond. By contrast, the bending mode (v2) is shifted
to higher frequency by 3% in ice, indicating a stiffening of the spring constant for bending, as
formation of the hydrogen bonds requires the H-O-H angle to open from its equilibrium value
for the isolated molecule (104.5°) towards the tetrahedral angle of the ice crystal (109.5°).

The water-vapour rotation band at 4 > 20m is shifted to shorter wavelength in ice as the
libration (hindered rotation) band at 12 um. Lattice vibrations appear at 45 and 65 um; they have
no counterpart in the vapour because they are intermolecular vibrations of the hydrogen bond.

Comparing figure 1b to figure le shows the relationship of mye to mim: wherever mim is large (of
order 1), the real index undergoes an oscillation, finally asymptoting to a higher level at longer
wavelength, increasing from 1.3 in the visible to 1.8 in the microwave. The real and imaginary
indices are related by Kramers—Kronig relations; in fact the mye(A) in figure 1 was computed from
a weighted integral of mim over wavelength as detailed by Warren [3] and WBO08 [4].

(b) Birefringence

Ordinary ice has a hexagonal crystal structure, so it is birefringent; refraction depends on the
angle between the c-axis of the crystal and the direction and polarization of the incident light.
For example, at the visible wavelength 546nm, mye = 1.3104 for the ordinary ray and 1.3118


for the extraordinary ray ([8], table 3.1). This small difference, only 0.1%, can be ignored for 4 |
computing reflectances and transmittances of clouds and snow, but it is large enough to be useful
