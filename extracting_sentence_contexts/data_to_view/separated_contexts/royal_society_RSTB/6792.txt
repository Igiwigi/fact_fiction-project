t It should perhaps be pointed out that Astbury’s work has already entered cytology in a paper by
Naithani (1937) referred to in the footnote to p. 188 above. Naithani’s suggestion was that a molecular
change of the f-a keratin type might underlie the post-pachytene chromosome shorlening recognized
by Belling and Sax, but gave no facts of any kind to support it. In the light of what has been shown
for Osmunda this suggestion would seem to be highly improbable and the post-pachytene shortening in
Osmunda will be dealt with here under the heading of supercontraction.

signs are primarily symbolic and do not imply precise knowledge of the physical basis
of attraction.
