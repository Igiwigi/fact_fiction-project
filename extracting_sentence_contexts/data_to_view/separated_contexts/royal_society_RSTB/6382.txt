With increased
density of the culture the effect of factors (3) and (4) result in the appearance of
persistent resting spores. These will germinate when transferred into new culture
medium under otherwise the same conditions which induce formation of resting spores
in dense cultures. Comparing these results with conditions prevailing in the sea one should consider
the fact that the culture medium is much richer in nutrient material than sea water. The population which can be maintained by a unit of ‘‘Erdschreiber” is far greater
than by the same amount of water in the sea even under optimal conditions. Therefore
one would expect a lesser density of the population to be sufficient to induce resting
spore formation in the sea than in cultures.
