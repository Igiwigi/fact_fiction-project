'The effect of attraction on the form of the nebulous matter
depends on its original expansion, or the time of the
action and on the quantity of the attracting matter, go2

Concentric brightness as well as globular form indicates

the general gravitation of the nebulous matter, 308

Progressive condensation may be scen in the formation
of nuclei, - - - - - go8

Some part of the nebulous matter is probably elastic, 313
The uniform light of nuclei, and of much condensed ne-
bulz, proves that the nebulous matter is considerably

opaque, - - - - - 313

The nebulous matter in a cubical space of 10' will admit
of a condensation of two trillion and 208: thousand

globe of the diameter of our sun, - - 319
Planetary nebulz have a rotatory motion on their axes, g19
The original eccentricity of the nebulous matter of a
nebula may be the physical cause of the rotatory

motion of celestial bodies, - - - 319

Their fictitious appearance was owing to a dispersion-of
their light in passing through nebulous matter, g21

In thirty-seven years the nebulosity of this nebula has
undergone great changes and much greater since
the time of Huycnens, - - -

Nebulz are not permanent celestial bodies, -

Additional proof of the opacity of the nebulous matter,

Very distant nebulosities, which cannot be seen in a state
of diffusion, may become visible when condensed into

When the object is very like a $tar, it becomes ditfioult to
ascertain whether it is a star or a nebula, -

When we cannot ascertain whether the doubtful object
is astar or a nebula, of which several instances are

POSTSCRIPT. Tr will be seen that in this paper I have only considered the
nebulous part of the construction of the heavens, and have
taken a star for the limit of my researches.
