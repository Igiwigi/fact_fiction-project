Their irregularity,
where all else is regular, is evidence of their unreliability except as indicating orders of magnitude: the
reason is obvious. If these values could be experimentally determined with accuracy, they would
probably be quite different from those obtained by the use of a perfectly homogeneous radiation of wave-
length given in column IT. Still, this fact would not appreciably affect the conclusions drawn below,
because the values are compared with corresponding absorptionsâ€”that is, with the absorptions of identical
radiations. PROF. C. G. BARKLA ON X-RAYS AND THE THEORY OF RADIATION.
