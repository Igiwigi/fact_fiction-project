47. It may be remarked that the system of lines and planes is at once deduced from
that belonging to I=12, by supposing that in the double-sixer the corresponding lines
1 and V, &e. seyerally coincide; the line 12, instead of being given as the intersection
of the planes 12), 1/2, is given as the third line in the plane 12, which in fact represents
p the coincident planes 12' and 1'2.
