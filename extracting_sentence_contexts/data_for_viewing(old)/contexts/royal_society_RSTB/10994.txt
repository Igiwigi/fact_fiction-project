significantly higher. This mutant was used to carry out the com-
parison of metabolome and transcript level with wild-type.
Metabolite analysis showed that silencing of PCC1 slowed
down the 3 BCAA degradation, and in particular, Ile content at
day 6 was much higher than that of wild-type. Nevertheless,
all the 3 BCAA contents decreased to a very low level in the
mutant at day 10, which is comparable to that of wild-type
(figure 3). PCC lesion disturbs carboxylation of propionyl-CoA
to methylmalonyl-CoA, and thus might change Ile metabolism.
An interconversion between Ile and Val catalysed by valine-3-
methyl-2-oxovalerate transaminase (VMOAT) was reported
in pea [26], and Val can convert into Leu in P. tricornutum
and Arabidopsis, which might account for the fact that PCC
silencing affected all three BCAA metabolisms. Quantitative
real-time PCR analysis showed a significantly lower mRNA
level for many BCAA degradation-related genes in strain
peclp at 60h compared with wild-type (figure 4). However,
the transcript levels of most of the BCAA degradation-related
genes recovered to levels comparable to those in wild-type at
84h, while an about threefold increase was observed in
acetyl-CoA C-acyltransferase (ACAT), a-subunit of methylcroto-
nyl-CoA carboxylase (MCC1) and HIBCH. HIBCH was also
upregulated (twofold) at 108 h. It is suggested that silencing
of PCC activated propionyl-CoA metabolism to acetyl-CoA
via a modified B-oxidation pathway, thus resulting in carbon
