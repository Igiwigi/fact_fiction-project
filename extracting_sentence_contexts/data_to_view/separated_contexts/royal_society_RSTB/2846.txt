As a consequence there is a violent excitation ot
the cardio-inhibitory and vaso-motor mechanisms. The heart is slowed and at the
same time has to work against a suddenly increased pressure, and it gives way. In
fact, we have the phenomena of asphyxiation in their entirety. The vessels of the splanchnic area are affected par passw with those of the body
generally, and they in no wise act independently. The vaso-motor mechanism
remains active throughout, and is as we have seen profoundly affected by changes in
the venosity of the blood.

(6) Cobra venom when injected in large doses, and especially when given intra-
venously, causes (1) a sudden fall of blood pressure ; (2) a subsequent rise, provided
the dose has not been too large ; and (8) a final fall to zero.
