Estimates of income inequality and its patterns over
time are available for single countries and for the
entire world (World Bank 2006; Anand & Segal
2008). Nevertheless, there is lack of agreement
regarding the direction of the change in income
inequality experienced by the world and by each
single country, with some authors arguing that
globalization is increasing inequality (e.g. Milanovic
2005) and other authors arguing exactly the opposite
(e.g. Sala-i-Martin 2006).

There is, however, a general consensus on two facts,
which have important implications for the analysis and
the prediction of food demand patterns in the world.
First, world income inequality is very high (Anand &
Segal 2008). Estimates of the Gini coefficient? for the
world income distribution are around and above 0.7,
a level of inequality that cannot be found within any
single country of the world, not even the most unequal.
Second, when income inequality among citizens in the
world is decomposed into between- and within-
countries inequality, it is found that most of global
income inequality (between 80 and 90%) is between-
country inequality (Anand & Segal 2008). This implies
