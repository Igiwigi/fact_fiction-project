Information is continually flowing
in the opposite direction. I will return later to the significance of this fact for
neo-Darwinism itself. To these facts we must add a few more before we reassess the comparison
yetween physics and biology.

(vii) Many genetic changes, either knockouts or mutations, appear not to have
significant phenotypic effects; or rather they have effects that are subtle,
often revealed only when the organism is under stress. For example,
complete deletion of genes in yeast has no obvious phenotypic effect in 80
per cent of cases. Yet, 97 per cent have an effect on growth during stress
(Hillenmeyer et al. 2008).
