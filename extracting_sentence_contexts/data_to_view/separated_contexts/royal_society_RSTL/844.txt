The saturated astringent infusions of barks contain much less
extractive matter, in proportion to their tannin, than the weak
infusions; and, when skin is quickly tanned in them, common
experience shows that it produces leather less durable than the
leather slowly formed.

manufacturer, which might have been made to enter into the
composition of his leather. These observations show, that there
is some foundation for the vulgar opinion of workmen, con-
cerning what is technically called the feeding of leather in the
slow method of tanning ; and, though the processes of the art
may in some cases be protracted for an unnecessary length of
time, yet, in general, they appear to have arrived, in consequence
of repeated practical experiments, at a degree of perfection
which cannot be very far extended by means of any elucidations
of theory that have as yet been made known. On the first view it appears singular that, in those cases of
tanning where extractive matter forms a certain portion of the
leather, the increase of weight is less than when the skin is
combined with pure tannin ; but the fact is easily accounted for,
when we consider that the attraction of skin for tannin must be
probably weakened by its union with extractive matter ; and,
whether we suppose that the tannin and extractive matter enter
together into combination with the matter of skin, or unite with
Separate portions of it, still, in either case, the primary attraction
of tannin for skin must be, to a'certain extent, diminished. In examining astringent vegetables in relation to their powers
of tanning skin, it is necessary to take into account, not only
the quantity they contain of the subsance precipitable by gela-
tine, but likewise the quantity, and the nature, of the extractive
matter; and, in- cases of comparison, it is essential to employ.
infusions of the same degree of concentration,

It is evident, from the experiments detailed in the IIId section,
that of all the astringent substances which have been as yet
examined, catechu is that which contains the largest propor-
tion of tannin; and, in supposing, according to the common

estimation, that from four to five pounds of common oak bark
are required to produce one pound of Jeather, it appears, from
the various synthetical experiments, that about half a pound of
catechu would answer the same purpose.*

Also, allowing for the difference in the composition of the
different kinds of leather, it appears, from the. general detail of
facts, that one pound of catechu, for the common uses of the
tanner, would be nearly equal in value to 24 pounds of galls,
to 7+ pounds of the bark of the Leicester willow, to 11 pounds
of the bark of the Spanish chesnut, to 18 pounds of the bark of
the elm, to 21 pounds of the bark of the common willow, and
to 3 pounds of sumach. Various menstruums have been proposed for the purpose of
expediting and improving the process of tanning, and, amongst
them, lime-water and the solutions of pearl-ash : but, as these
two substances form compounds with tannin which are not de-
composable by gelatine, it follows that their effects must be
highly pernicious ; and there is very little reason to suppose, that
any bodies will be found which, at the same time that they
increase the solubility of tannin in water, will not likewise di-
minish its attraction for skin,

* This estimation agrees very well with the experiments lately made by Mr, Pur x1s,
upon the tanning powers of Bombay catechu in the processes of manufacture, and which
he has permitted me to mention, Mr.
