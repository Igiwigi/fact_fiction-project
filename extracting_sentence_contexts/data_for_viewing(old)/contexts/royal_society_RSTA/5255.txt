Earth and have been transported to our planetary neighbours either by our own intervention,
reinforcing the need for planetary protection protocols for our spacecraft and landers, or through
panspermia processes, which could include the deposition of chemical building bricks from
elsewhere through delivery by meteorites, comets and asteroids. The precise definition of life is
actually rather elusive and many attempts to do so have been eventually deemed unsatisfactory
[7-10]; the NASA definition of life as ‘a self-sustaining system capable of Darwinian evolution’
incorporates a molecular genesis with replicative procedures and avoids several pitfalls of
alternative definitions based upon the ability of the system to reproduce [11].

2. Astrobiology versus exobiology

There has been much confusion in the literature between the terms astrobiology and exobiology
with a conclusion that exobiology is the more archaic; in fact, as two elegant articles demonstrate
[12,13], astrobiology was the earlier of the two by some 20 years. Although both are related to
the study of extraterrestrial life, astrobiology was first used by Lafleur [14], an article which was
largely ignored and not followed up until Tikhov’s book in 1953 [15], itself an enlargement from
his use of the term ‘astrobotany’ in 1949 to describe his belief that vegetation existed on Mars and
Venus. Tikhov was the first to suggest that spectral signatures from other planets could be used to
assess their biotic potential, which today lies at the heart of remote space exploration. Strughold
[16] also used the term ‘astrobiology’ in 1953, but thereafter it fell into disuse until 1983 [17]
which prefaced its revival in the 1990s with the foundation of the NASA Astrobiology Institute
and the worldwide excitement and discourse generated by the discovery of the Allen Hills SNC
Martian meteorite, ALH 84001, in Antarctica and the observation of possible biotic morphological
signatures therein [18]. As both Cockell and Martinez-Frias and Hochberg explain, exobiology
was coined first by Lederberg [19] to specifically describe life beyond the Earth; in this context,
