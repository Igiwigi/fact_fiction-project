that all components of the test repository (and their dependen-
cies) are running correctly. We also provide a Docker image in
the test repository, which implements all tests in all sub-projects
without the need for local installation of ScilInit, NEURON and
the NeuroML tool chain. Analogous to an image on a virtual
machine, a Docker image (http:// www.docker.com) is a compart-
mentalized operating system which is frozen in a pre-configured

curation and automated tools, yielding curated databases of
empirical observations (from experiments on the biological
worm) and structured, machine-readable models at several
scales. Summaries of observations are extracted from these
databases, representing stylized facts about experiments.
Models are simulated to produce corresponding predictions,

shifting package management complexity from users to develo- yield test scores. Models may then be tuned based on the ade-
pers [10]. Consequently, the Docker image is guaranteed to run quacy of these scores in order to produce better-performing
