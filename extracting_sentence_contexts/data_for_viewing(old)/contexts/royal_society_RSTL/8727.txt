of a solenoid whose axis was 28-7 centimetres long. The whole strength of current cir-

culating round a length 3x of the solenoid was therefore Ix EN 3x, and the mag-

netizing force to which the steel wire was 8ubjected ir x35 or 123. Hence, as

remarked by Professxor MAXWELL, who, in reporting on this paper, first made the pre-
ceding estimate, we may call the magnetizing force a large one, s0 large, in fact, that it
probably magnetizes the wire nearly to saturation at once. For the sake of comparison
it may be remarked that the horizontal and yertical components of the earth's magnetic
force at Glasgow are about *16 and -43 ; and in first experimenting with the apparatus now
described, I made sure that the magnetization of the wire by the vertical component of the
earth's magnetizing force was not essentially concerned in any of the results, by reversing
the magnetizing current, then applying and removing weights repeatedly, then stopping
the current, and again putting weights on and off repeatedly. The deflections of the
galvanometer observed in this succession of operations were not sensibly different from
those observed previously, but in reverse directions; that is to say, the results still
fulfilled the preceding statements.

The fact that the effect of pull to diminish magnetization and of taking off pull to
