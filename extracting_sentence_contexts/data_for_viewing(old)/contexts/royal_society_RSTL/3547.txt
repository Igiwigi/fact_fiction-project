They were composed of transparent discs, having, as viewed in the microscope, that
peculiar yellow colour, which seems to characterize the corpuscle of the blood ; and
which when these corpuscles are accumulated, presents to the naked eye the well-
known red. These discs, perhaps in some instances about twelve in number in each
nucleus, were elliptical, and exhibited a cavity or depression. They were distinetly
unconnected, though in contact, with one another; and seemed on the point of being
Separated. The figure represents one cell from which they were escaping.

85. Future observation must determine what these discs really are, I venture to
believe it very possible that they represent a state of the corpuscles of the blood.

86. On a former occasion-F;, I showed that the blood-corpuscles in the embryo are
not formed, as supposed by some observers, out of granules of the yelk. The facts
recorded in the foregoing memoir leave little doubt, I think, that these corpuscles,—
not only in the embryo, but at all periods of life, —are descendants of the two cells
constituting the foundation of the new being in the oyum. If s0, it is not requisite to
seek the origin of these corpuscles in the organized parenchymatous substance of the
body, or in the globules of the chyle; © the only two sources,” it has been said, in
which it was possible for them to arise. Authors on © cells,” regarding the liquor
sanguinis as the * cytoblastema,” appear inclined to consider the corpuscles of the
blood as arising in it, independently of previously existing corpuscles.
