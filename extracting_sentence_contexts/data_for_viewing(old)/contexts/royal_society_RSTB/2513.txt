mentosa consists of a peculiar change in the pigment layer of the retina, which
commences in the region of the Ora serrata. The pigment gradually invades the
retina, spreading insidiously and concentrically over it towards the macula. There
where this disturbance of the pigment occurs, which forms so striking an appearance
with the ophthalmoscope, the sight disappears concurrently with it, so that the extent
of the invasion marks the limit of the visual field.

T have noticed in certain night animals, more particularly in the Galagos and
Lorides, a heaping-up of pigment all around the periphery, which, seen with the
ophthalmoscope, greatly resembles Retinitis pigmentosa. Exposing a Galago to day-
light for some montlis, I found it to go quite blind; the invasion of the pigment
could clearly be seen to advance concentrically towards the posterior pole, as I have
seen the disease spread in Man. It is a well-known fact that Bears frequently become
blind in captivity, owing to their being too much exposed to light.

Although in cases of Retinitis pigmentosa both day-blindness and night-blindness
oceur, I thought that these observations on night animals pointed to the possibility
of arresting the insidious progress of the disease, of which blindness is the invariable
termination, by shielding the eyes trom the most active rays of daylight. A few
attempts to do this by the use of spectrum-blue goggles—glasses which only
transmit the centre of the spectrum, viz., the blue, green, and a portion of the yellow
rays—have given encouraging results, and I am therefore persevering in that
direction.
