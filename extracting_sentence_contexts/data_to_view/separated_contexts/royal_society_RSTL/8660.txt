Captain PoeLLEN thinks not. But there are inequalities in some cases 80 apparent,
that they can hardly be accounted for, except by a shifting of the index. In one
instance, in fact, while the thermometer at 7890 feet indicated 41**, the index, owing
to rough weather, had shifted to 67* at a depth of 11760 feet. Captain PuLLEx speaks
also of some of the instruments being more regular in their indications than others. After, however, eliminating those readings, which are evidently too high (marked with
a ? in Tables), the value of the other observations remains unaffected.
