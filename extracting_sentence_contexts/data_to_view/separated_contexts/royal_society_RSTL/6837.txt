Even a very super-
ficial examination of these Tables at any one station sufficed to show that certain hours
were more affected by disturbance than others. These hours were not the same at
different stations; and no distinct relation could be traced at any station between the
hours of principal disturbance and those of the well-recognized horary fluctuation due
to the regular solar-diurnal variation. It was obvious therefore that the horizontal line
at the bottom of each monthly table, which showed the mean values at the several hours
(or what might be termed the diurnal inequality), did in fact represent two variations,
viz. 1st, the regular s0lar-diurnal variation, and 2nd, a diurnal yariation due to the dis-
turbances ; the two having every appearance of proceeding either from distinct causes or
from distinct actions of the same original cause. The means of separating them per-
Feetly from each other did not readily present themselves, but to do 80 approximately,
and with an approximation quite sufficient for many practical purposes, was merely a
work of labour, The yery feature which marked certain of the observations as disturbed,
