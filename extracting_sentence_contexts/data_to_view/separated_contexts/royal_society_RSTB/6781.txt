Certain facts about all these types are by now sufficiently
clear, in a descriptive if not in a causal sense. In each case, however, the sum of
published descriptions is deficient, either in details of spiral structure, or in knowledge
of chromosome lengths at crucial stages such as leptotene, to name only two of the
most important omissions. Yet the discovery of spiral structure alone, or rather its
rediscovery* in recent years, is probably one of the most far-reaching facts with which
modern cytology has to deal. The realization that the apparent shape of the chromo-
some is merely the external form of a spiral coil must obviously entail very considerable
reorientation of old ideas. The rewriting of descriptive cytology in conformity with
this new knowledge is, however, impossible unless and until the facts regarding it are
fully known.
