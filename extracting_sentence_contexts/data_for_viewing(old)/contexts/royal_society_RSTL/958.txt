It will be readily seen, that I have here deduced the com-
position of the grey oxide from the actual quantity of oxy-
gen and metal obtained in the experiments; and this mode
of analysis seems liable to little objection, and can very rarely
be resorted to, in ascertaining the composition of metallic
oxides, On comparing my previous experiments upon the
grey oxide, with the above results, I am most inclined to
place confidence in the latter. There is, indeed, a near co-
incidence between them, and the difference, which is only
about one per cent, may be referred to the presence of a
little more acid in my first experiments. The grey oxide is
insoluble in aqua regia, a fact which seems to add additional
support to Sir H. Davy's opinion respecting the action of
aqua regia on platinum.* This menstruum, according to
Sir H. Davy, does not oxidate platinum, but merely causes
its combination with chlorine. Now, if the metal were oxi-
dated previous to its solution, the oxygen, there is reason to
think, would be derived from the nitrous acid, and the grey
oxide formed by this acid, be produced, which can scarcely
