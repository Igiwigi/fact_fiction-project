IIâ€”Source or MATERIAL

It so happens that the most complex of the various methods of budding in
Tunicates were the first to be examined, and the relation of one to another remained
obscure. In the present account are included reviews or reinvestigations of the
types of budding already fairly well known, and at the same time descriptions of
budding in a number of genera hitherto ignored. One great difficulty in the way
of such investigations is the fact that asexual reproduction in its less specialized
forms is, among Tunicates, a winter phenomenon and the colonies themselves are
often unrecognizable. Some material in budding condition was obtained during
summer months at the marine laboratories at Plymouth and Bermuda, but for
the most part material was collected by Mr. G.
