LowEnTHAL (42) goes so fi

He brings forward no evidence which, in my opinion, supports the first part of

theory. JOHNSTONE (29) considers that the design of menstruation is to change the ute
mucosa, a view also held by Feoxristrow (13) and others, ‘

Tn strong contrast with these views is that of Kine (32). He considers menst
tion is a disease, an abnormal, unnatural, acquired habit, due to the fact that Wor
do not breed early enough. The fact that vessels rupture during menstruation,
argues, is proof that the process is an unnatural one, and in support of his argun
he urges that abnormal congestion in organs gives rise to fibroid growth, and #
fibroid growths in the uterus are common,

The evidence which Kine brings in support of his theory is criticized by Srupt
(73), and shown to be capable of other interpretation, while the work of Rerrersrr (
on the Bitch, my own researches on S. entellus, and KrizGEr (33), Trzx (75), Ra

Finally, PLayrair (54) says the purpose of the loss of blood in menstruation
quite unknown,

The view that menstruation is designed to prepare the uterus for the reception
an ovum, seems to be the view most generally maintained; it is held by those
believe denudation takes place and by those who believe no denudation occurs. ft
one presumably believes it is the growth of tissue which prepares the uterus for
reception of the ovum, the other that it is the changing of the tissue by denudati¢
which is the important phase of the preparation. These views are, therefore, conti
dictory, and, doubtless, the contradiction is due to the fact that the period of gro
and the period of degeneration have not been clearly recognized.
