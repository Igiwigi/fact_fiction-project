modern birds and present in the earliest diverging, extant
palaeognath clades (figure 1b). If MB evolved after the diver-
gence of crocodilians and birds, it is hypothesized to have
arisen somewhere within Avemetatarsalia (bird-line archo-
saurs, figure 1a), and possibly outside of Avialae (e.g.
[41,42]). Indeed, birds and non-avian dinosaurs share a
common ancestor (e.g. [51]), and an ever-increasing body of
evidence reveals that numerous morphological and physio-
logical adaptations seen exclusively in Neornithes among
extant archosaurs (e.g. feathers, powered flight, relatively
high growth rates, advanced parental care, monochronic ovu-
lation, relatively thin long bone cortices, pneumatized
postcranial skeleton, etc.) were, in fact, progressively acquired
from their dinosaurian predecessors (e.g. [51-54]). However,
the evolutionary timing of acquisition of MB remains
unknown, and the step-wise acquisition of the unique avian
reproductive biology, including calcium metabolism, is
incompletely understood.

Using the microstructural and developmental criteria of
MB listed above, Schweitzer et al. [41] were the first to ident-
ify MB-like tissues in an extinct taxon; in this case, the
hindlimbs of a Tyrannosaurus rex (specimen MOR 1125).
This study triggered great interest within the paleontological
community, because the unequivocal identification of tissues
