out of a green area in an X infected tobacco. The strain has been carried on in tobacco
for over forty generations with only slight variation of symptoms. In one line we
have twenty-four consecutive generations in which no selection of inoculum in relation
to symptom expression of the parent plant was made, and the end product proved
to be as good a type of X® as did the original source. We may state therefore that
passage per se has no effect in altering the virulence—as expressed by symptom
development—of the X® strain of the X virus.

When the cultures were more closely examined, it was seen that they were not all
strictly alike. In a number of plants a greater or lesser number of small bright yellow
spots were found superimposed on the normal X¢ mottle. In those cases where the
inoculum was obtained exclusively from these yellow spots the inoculated plants
exhibited an increasingly more virulent type of reaction. These facts led to the view


ITS STRAINS AND REACTIONS 177

that although the X° strain reacted generally in a uniform manner, the cultures were
nevertheless contaminated with a more severe type of virus.

It was natural to suppose that inasmuch as the L type had been recovered from
another spot on the same leaf of the same plant as that from which the G strain was
derived, we should find that the virus strain which was acting as a contaminant would
be the Z type. Curiously enough, the X” type was only recovered twice in the X¢
series even when it was put to the most severe analysis. The first occasion was early
