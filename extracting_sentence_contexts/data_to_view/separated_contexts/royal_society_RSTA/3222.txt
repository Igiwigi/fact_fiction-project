derivatives of the background fields in the bubble wall.! This approximation is controlled as :8
long as the average de Broglie wavelength approximately 1/T of particles in the plasma is small 1m

compared to the width Ly of the wall. In contrast, the expansion in powers of the VEV is not
known to be convergent (though certain subclasses of higher powers can be resummed [36,37]),
which may be related to the fact that this formalism can predict sizable sources even for masses
significantly greater than T, despite the expected Boltzmann suppression. As a result, the WKB method gives much less optimistic estimates of the baryon asymmetry
compared to the VEV expansion, as figure 2b illustrates for the MSSM. In order to get the observed
BAU, ref. [20] needed to assume maximal CP violation (@ = arg[zm] = 2/2) in the chargino mass
matrix, as well as light charginos yu ~ m2 ~ 100GeV, now ruled out by LHC, whereas ref. [21]
could do so with a phase of order 10? for light charginos, or for chargino mass >800 GeV if the
phase was maximal.
