E The © yellow cells,” on treatment with ScauLze's fluid, gave a distinct cellulose
Reaction, and in their interior the presence of starch was detected with iodine in
iodide of potassium, but, as in former cases, the best results were obtained by
previously extracting the tentacles with alcohol, and then macerating them in a weak
8olution of caustic potash, and neutralising with acetic acid. In young specimens of
Anthea cereus I found much fewer cells than in the larger ones, and in these the starch
and cellulose reactions could be more easily obtained.
Since caustic potash and canstic soda change this colouring matter completely, it is
nseless to attempt to saponify it, and this very fact distinguishes, as I said before,
the colouring matter of the © yellow cells” from enterochlorophyll, other animal chloro-

* Knukcexpers noticed this change with caustic soda, loc. cit., but failed in seeing that this test
distinguished the pigment from what he called hepatochromates (= enterochlorophyll).
