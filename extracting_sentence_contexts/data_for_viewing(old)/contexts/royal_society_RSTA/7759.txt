heights between Regions E and F were, however, very frequent. Another marked
feature was the relative complexity of all types of echoes compared with the simpler
types obtained at Slough. Such complex echoes were rarely constant in structure,
there being ceaseless changes in the components. The general impression is that
the ionospheric structure at Troms6 is less definite and certainly more variable with
respect to time than is the case in South-East England.

It is highly probable that the marked variability in the intensity and structure of
the echoes at Troms√© is to be associated with the magnetic activity which is rarely
absent in such latitudes. Support for this view is found in the fact that during
magnetic activity, when echoes were obtained, they were found to be of marked
variability and often did not fall into the usual category of Region E or Region F
echoes. In other words, magnetic activity was associated with an ionospheric
structure different from the normal configuration.

Our ionospheric observations preceding and during the Polar Year led us to
recognize an outstanding difficulty in connexion with the interpretation of the results
obtained for Region F. This difficulty was also appreciated by workers in other
countries and we were of opinion that until it could be solved the elucidation of the
actual observations made during the Polar Year was bound to be incomplete. A
continuation of the work was therefore arranged at Slough during the remaining
months of 1933 and during 1934, special attention being paid to the difficulty in
