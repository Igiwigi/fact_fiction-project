this brings us naturally to face the question whether that analysis may not have
Bbeen pushed altogether too far in the computation of the figures of equilibrium under
Bliscussion. This question is considered in § 9, and a rough criterion of the limits of
‘capplicability of this analysis is there found. From this it appears that even in the
cases of figs. 2 and 3 the result must present a fair approximation to correctness.
pilhe criterion, indeed, appears to be such as necessarily to give too unfavourable
oh view of the correctness of the result.
= The rigorous method of discussing the stability of the system having failed, certain
‘considerations are adduced in § 11 which bear on the conditions under which there is
form of equilibrium consisting of two fluid masses in close promixity. It appears
that there cannot be such a form with the two masses just in contact, unless the
Zsmaller of the two masses exceeds in mass about one-thirtieth of the larger.
= If we take into consideration the fact that the criterion of the applicability of
Sharmonic analysis is too severe, it appears to be worth while to find to what results
Ethe analysis leads when two masses, one 27 times as great as the other, are brought
gelose together.. The numerical work of the calculation is omitted, since the numbers
Ecan only represent the true conclusion very roughly ; but the result is illustrated
B graphically in figs. 6 and 7, Plate 23. These figures can only serve to give a general
idea of the truth, but the form into which the smaller mass is thrown is so remarkable
as to be worthy of attention. The deep furrow round the smaller mass, lying in
Ba plane parallel to the axis of rotation, cannot be due merely to the imperfection
of the solution; and it appears to point to the conclusion that there is a tendency for
the smaller body to separate into two, just as we have seen the Jacobian ellipsoid
become dumb-bell shaped and separate into two parts.
