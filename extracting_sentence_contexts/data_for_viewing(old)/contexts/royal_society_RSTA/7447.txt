procedure and shall approximate to this term by writing it in the form w(dv*/dz), where
v*, defined in (3-42), is the zonal velocity which develops as R becomes sufficiently large.
It is not actually necessary to perform this substitution, for the method we use could equally
apply to the term in its original form, but the detailed working is made rather easier by the
substitution of v* for v and the result to the present approximation is not affected. Since we
have replaced v by its asymptotic value for large R we can ultimately study the solution of
the equations only in the large R range. In order to study this term in the small & range we
should have to replace v by the expression (3-36), but since interest centres principally in
the range of large R all this section will be devoted to this range. The approximation made
above is not sufficient to make the equations tractable, and I shall approximate further in
the equations of motion by taking V?=0?/dz* in the Navier-Stokes terms, that is, the
differentials with respect to 7 are ignored. ‘This may be justified because of the shallowness
of the liquid contained in the dishpan and is in fact a similar approximation to that made
in earlier sections where the velocity components are expanded in powers of a. A similar
approximation is permissible in dealing with atmospheric flow on the spherical earth.
