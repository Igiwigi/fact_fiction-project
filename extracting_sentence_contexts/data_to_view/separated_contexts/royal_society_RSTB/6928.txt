C. W. WARDLAW ON THE SHOOT APEX OF DRYOPTERIS 373

the existence of the shoot or axis as an independent member is more or less explicitly
denied, the plant being envisaged as a construction of phytons or segments of which the
leaf-bases, or extensions thereof, unite to form the shoot. Although in some instances
such theories—which usually but not invariably, e.g. Campbell (1921), have only a sub-
jective significance—may appear to have a limited application or may actually possess
value for descriptive purposes, they impress one as being artificial and divorced from the
facts of physiology and embryology. The present observations, in which the further growth
of an isolated apical meristem has yielded in the first instance a vasculated axis without
leaves, give further grounds for rejecting phytonic theories of shoot construction. On the
other hand, those who have supported axial theories—in which the shoot is accepted as
a phyletically pre-existing axis or stem from which the leaves have subsequently developed—
may be criticized on the grounds that their views are non-physiological in character.
