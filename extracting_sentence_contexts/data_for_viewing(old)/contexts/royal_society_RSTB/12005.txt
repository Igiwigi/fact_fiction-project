components of manner of death verbs reside on different levels
of meaning suggests an alternative pathway. Complementarity
may be a hard constraint after all, but perhaps it is a constraint
only on certain levels of meanings.

Widening our view somewhat, manner of death verbs are not
the only verbs that have some kind of complex verbal concept.
Consider the classic case of a verb like regret in (51) when com-
pared with dream in (52). In addition to their more overt
meanings (disappointment and dreaming, respectively), both
verbs take propositions like he smoked as complements, but
the status they give to their propositions is distinct. The verb
regret requires its proposition to be a fact, something true of
the real world, while dream has no such requirement. Saying
(51) assumed the proposition he smoked to be true. Therefore,
we say that regret is a factive verb.

(51) Sam regrets that he smoked.
a. Assertion: Sam is disappointed that he smoked.
b. Presupposition: Sam has smoked.

(52) Sam dreamed that he smoked.
a. Assertion: Sam had a dream that he smoked.
b. Presupposition: Sanihas-smoked.
