of November). The average monthly rainfalls for that period are as follows :—January, 578 inches ;
February, 4:29 inches; March, 3°79 inches ; April, 422 inches ; May, 9°85 inches ; June, 12°87 inches ;
July, 11:34 inches ; August, 11-97 inches ; September, 13°69 inches ; October, 10°84 inches ; November,
12-05 inches; December, 9°78 inches. It will be seen that the first four months of the year constitute
the “dry season.” The average yearly rainfall is about 110 inches,

island to the sea, so that a comparatively small submergence would convert it into a
strait.’* But a better instance of this is the broad open valley on the south side of
the Soufriare, between that mountain and the Morne Garu. It is a significant fact
that there is no good road from the leeward to the windward side over the mountains,
and that the only passable footpath was an old Carib track which started from
Chateaubelair and went to Georgetown. It led right up to the edge of the crater of
the Soufriére before descending on the other side, an ascent of 3000 feet. It stuck to the
summits of the spurs between the valleys, where the vegetation was least dense, and
there was least probability of a wash-out due to the sudden rains and floods. At first
glance it would have appeared easier to follow the course of the valley across the
island, but this would have passed through dense forests, and the lateral streamlets
descending the side of the valley to join the rivers would have been difficult to cross
in time of flood, and would have caused much damage to any road carried over them.
In such a situation a road would also have been exposed to landslides and falls of
rock, which would have often rendered it impassable.
