‘The polyandry revolution’. Hartl [4] presented evidence that polyandrous female fruit flies, Drosophila
melanogaster, can bias sperm utilization and fertilization in favour of the ejaculates
of certain males, a process they called sperm preference, which inspired ideas of
cryptic female choice [5,6]. These early observations introduced the idea that poly-
andry might be more widespread than originally assumed, and that it may have
drastic repercussions for the Darwinian fitness of males and females. The advent

female polyandrous behaviours. However, the study of female polyandry has
exploded over recent years, branching out by considering different ecological
