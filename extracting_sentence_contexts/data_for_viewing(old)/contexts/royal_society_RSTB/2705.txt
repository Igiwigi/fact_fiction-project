Kashmir and further west it ceases to be the principal constituent. Almost all the

Indo-Malay genera, and a very large proportion of the species, are identical with

Assamese or Burmese forms. These facts are consistent with the theory that the
Tudo-Malay part of the Himalayan fauna, or the greater portion of it, has migrated
into the mountains from the eastward at a comparatively recent period. It is an
important fact that this migration appears to have been from Assam and not from
the Peninsula of India.*

Thus there are several points left which require explanation. There is the much
greater richness of the Oriental constituent in the Cisgangetice fauna to the south-
ward in Malabar and Ceylon, although this is far away from the main Oriental area,
and the occurrence also in the southern part of the peninsula of various mammalian,
reptilian, and batrachian genera, such as Loris, Tragulus, Draco, [iolepis, and
