Proceeding to higher levels, however, we find a marked
diminution in the extent of the diurnal tide. At Mahabuleshwur, at 4500 feet, the
means of eight months reduce the oscillation to 0694 ; at Hurreechundurghur, at
3900 feet, the oscillation for the three hottest months was 0969 ; whilst at Kota-
gherry, at 6407 feet, it was for five months from noon to sunset only 0498. The oscil-
lation at Mababuleshwur, at 4500 feet, was in fact /ess than HumBorLpT's oscillation
at Mexico of 0708 at nearly 7000 feet. When we pass to the other tides we find the same puzzling anomalies. The mean
rise from 8unrise to 9â€”10 a.v., whether at Hurreechundurghur, at Mahabuleshwur,
or Kotagherry, instead of being less than at Poona, is in fact greater.
