to that in the Earth, even for elements for which meteorites from elsewhere in the Solar
System are different.

The late stage collision of the proto-Earth with another planet often called Theia provides the ‘least
worst’ explanation for many of these features. This Giant Impact model has been developed over
the years from the early ideas of Reginald Daly [2], to the more comprehensive multiple collision
version of Hartman & Davis [3] and the angular momentum argument of Cameron & Ward
[4]. In the 1980s, the powerful smoothed particle hydrodynamic simulations of giant impacts
were developed by Benz et al. [5], and these were followed by more detailed modelling by
Canup (reviewed in [6]). In all these computer simulations, the angular momentum (4 above)
is generated by the impact itself, Theia striking Earth with a glancing blow. In these simulations,
the material forming the Moon is mostly derived from Theia. This feature of successful Giant
Impact simulations has been the hardest to reconcile with geochemical data. The fact that the
isotopic compositions of silicate Earth and Moon are so similar despite evidence that other objects
are different provides evidence that either:

(1) The innermost Solar System from which these two objects formed was not so
heterogeneous after all or Theia accreted at a similar heliocentric distance to the Earth
[7,8].

or

(2) The atoms of the Moon were derived from the Earth after core formation and the
‘traditional’ simulations are incorrect [9-11]. New dynamic models have been proposed
in which the angular momentum constraint is violated (i.e. the Earth-Moon system began
