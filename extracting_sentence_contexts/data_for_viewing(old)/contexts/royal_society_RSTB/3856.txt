g series obtains instead of the ring of the more usual centric system. The rounded apex
oa with the two lateral stamens low down on its flanks now explains why the vascular
og bundles which will supply them are subsequently seen to be lower in the axis than
E the other four; the plane of the whorl is to be judged by taking a curved base of
5 insertion and not a horizontal line. Another interesting feature is that, as the six

‘

primordia further differentiate, the rounded shoulders of the “ primordial cushions ”
remain on either side of the gyneecial cone, giving the appearance of accessory pro-
tuberances, which at one time are so like the stamen-primordia and just the same size,
that they may be readily mistaken for stamens (fig. 15: 6, and fig. 16: 7; bud
0°53 mm. high). Thisin fact is what happened. McN as (1872) figures these apparent
sets of three primordia on either side of the gyncecium, omitting the lower lateral
stamens altogether. SrraspurGER (1872) missed the intermediate stages. This
emphasises the value of serial figures, drawn to corresponding scale. By comparing
the series 6-12 (figs. 15-19), it becomes obvious that the shoulders of the andrcecial
region, or “ primordial cushions” of McN a8, at first larger than the six primordia, then
