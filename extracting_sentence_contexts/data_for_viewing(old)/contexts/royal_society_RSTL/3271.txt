269. Nor is there any structure entitled to be denominated the © germinal mem-
brane;” for it is not a previously existing membrane which originates the germ,—hut
it is the previously existing germ which, by means of a hollow process (par. 267.),
originates a structure having the appearance of a membrane (par. 220.).

270. The structure entering into the formation of the amnion is no part of that
which constitutes the embryo (pars. 199. 200.). The first appearance of the amnion
is in the form of an epithelium (par. 184.). From the delineations of authors it ap-
pears to be a corresponding structure, which in Mollusca is the foundation of the
shell, and in Crustacea and Arachnida that of the outer covering of the abdomen
(pars. 243. 244.).

271. The most important of the foregoing facts respecting the development of the
mammiferous oyum, however opposed they may be to received opinions, are in ac-
cordance with, and may even explain, many observations which have been made on
the development of other animals, as recorded in the delineations of preceding ob-
servers (par. 243 to 253.).

272. The ovum may pass through at least one-and-twenty stages of development, —
and contain, besides the embryo, four membranes, one of which has two laminae,—
before it has itself attained the diameter of half a line (par. 207.), a fifth membrane
having disappeared by liquefaction within the oyum (par. 174.).

273. The size of the minute oyum in the Fallopian tube and uterus affords no cri-
terion of the degree of its development ; nor do any two parts of the minute ovum in
