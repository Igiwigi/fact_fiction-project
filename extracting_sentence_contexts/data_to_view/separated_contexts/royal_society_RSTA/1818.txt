The tilt of peaks C and D indicates that the fibre output has a small amount of chirp on
it. Interestingly, the curve through C and D traces the shape of the dispersion relation of the
fibre in which the resonant radiation is generated, reaffirming that the chirp on this fibre output
was mainly caused by propagation through excess fibre medium. Using the fact that resonant
radiation is created in an extremely small time window in an extreme pulse collapse, we can
predict that resonant radiation generated very close to the end of the fibre would be shorter
than 39 fs, closer to the bandwidth limited value. This potential for extremely short pulses makes
resonant radiation particularly appealing as a method of generating visible laser sources [33].

Figure 5. (a) A variety of fibre output spectra showing tunability of the resonant radiation across the whole visible spectrum,
normalized where possible. The narrow peaks on the left are the resonant radiation, and the other features in the infrared are the
pump remainder. (b) Two fibre output spectra showing how the sensitive pulse collapse dynamics can be exploited to generate
both very narrowband and very broadband outputs.
