In order to ee if this supposition were correct, I dissolyed
boracie acid in alcohol, and I found that a drop of this solution evaporated on a plate
of glass frequently yielded an abundant crop of the crystalline spherules. But these
are generally exceedingly small, requiring a high power to display in them the cross
and four sectors of light, and they speedily grow opake ; for which reason they are
not 80 well suited for observation as those prepared by the former method. They
establish the fact, however, that this mode of crystallizing is a property of the boracic
acid. It is highly improbable that it should be peculiar to that substance, but I haye
not yet met with it in any other. $ 3.
