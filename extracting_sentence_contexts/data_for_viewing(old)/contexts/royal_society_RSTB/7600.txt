Islanders in the olden days had a circuitous trade route to Papua; thus a trader from
Mer was said to have gone to Erub, and thence to Uger, Damut, Tutu, Mawata,
Turituri, Parama and finally to Kiwai (Haddon 1935, p. 183), but it is probable that
there was some direct trading of the Eastern Islanders with the islands of the estuary
of the Fly, and occasionally Fly river men brought canoes for delivery and spent some
months among their island friends. Since the coming of the white man intercourse
between the mainland of Papua and the islands has been facilitated.

Thus it is to be expected that the style and decorative motifs of the tobacco pipes
should show affinities with those of the Western Division of Papua west of the Fly and
of the Kiwaians of Mawata and Kiwai island. There can be little doubt that tobacco
pipes were exchanged occasionally, and so we may expect to find a few Torres Straits
pipes in Papua and Papuan pipes in the islands, but as a matter of fact there are but
few in either areas which can definitely be regarded as alien.

I have dealt (1912, pp. 141-3, 377-83; and for decorative patterns and designs,
pp. 343-61) at such length with tobacco smoking and tobacco pipes in Torres Straits
that I need give here only a summary, which, however, includes all the matter relevant
for comparative purposes.

We know that tobacco was grown and smoked in bamboo pipes in Torres Straits
a hundred years ago. Brockett (1836, p. 22) says that in Mer, ‘After the tobacco is dry
they plait it like a three-yarn sennett’, and Captain Lewis (1837, p. 754) states that
“They also cultivate the tobacco plant, which they prepare for smoking by drying the
leaves and twisting it up into “figs”.’ Macgillivray (1852, 2, 36) saw on Nagir some
