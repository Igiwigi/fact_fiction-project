sampling approach by a deterministic optimization problem that yields the maximum-likelihood
trajectory of the system that leads to a prescribed rare outcome. The advantage of this method
is the fact that it yields the best estimate of the typical extreme event in the limit of it becoming
increasingly rare, which is the limit we are most interested in, and at the same time also the regime
that is hardest to reach via DNS.

As we will discuss later, instanton techniques not only allow for the computation of the
limiting most likely path to obtain an extreme event, but further yield estimates for the
exponential tail scaling of the observable’s probability density function (PDF). A concrete
prediction of our results is the fact that intuitive rotationally symmetric realizations of extreme
vorticity outcomes (namely, vortex tubes/filaments) or extreme strain outcomes (namely,
colliding or contracting vortex rings) are not necessarily the most likely way to reach extreme
values, even if the observable exhibits rotational symmetry. In fact, we present that the rotationally
symmetric events become subdominant, particularly for large positive strain values, and are
dominated in probability by asymmetric field configurations. In other words, the stochastic
instanton undergoes spontaneous symmetry breaking, and the corresponding action exhibits a
dynamical phase transition similar to what is observed, e.g. in the KPZ equation [16].

This paper is organized as follows: we discuss the instanton approach, as applied to the NSE,
in §2 by first introducing the instanton formalism in §2a in general and subsequently applying it
to the NSE in §2b, where we also explain our conditioning on vorticity and strain. The numerical
implementation of the corresponding optimization problem is discussed in §2c. In §3a, we show
the most likely configuration for extreme vorticity events as obtained by the numerical solution
