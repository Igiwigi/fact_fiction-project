The class
of entities, between sets of which this relation holds, is called the “field” of R. Definitions of entities allied to R and to entities of the field of R are then given. These definitions involve no hypotheses as to the properties of R, but are of no
importance unless R has as a matter of fact certain properties. For example, it may
happen that the classes, thus defined, are all the null class (7.¢., the class with no
members) unless R has the requisite properties. Again deductions (in the second
stage), made without any hypothesis as to the properties of R, may be entirely trivial
unless R has certain properties, If R has not the requisite properties the deductions
often sink into the assertion that a certain proposition which is false implies some
other proposition.
