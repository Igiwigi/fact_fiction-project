cularly so in the apparent absence of tree growth in zone II, a feature we might infer
from the absence of fruit, cone scales, or wood (apart from Salix), as also from the low tree/
non-tree pollen ratio. This treelessness would be more remarkable because of the southerly
latitude, and the prompt appearance of warmth-demanding trees above the gravel layers
in what is presumably zone IV. If this treelessness is a reality, it might be attributed to
altitude, thin soil, or exposure, but it is equally possible that the absence of evidence for
tree growth is a fortuitous effect of conditions of incorporation at the site.

If we agree that the Allerod oscillation is indeed represented, we are thrown back upon
the problem of the nature of the vegetation at the commencement of the post-Glacial
period, a matter already considered somewhat in § 5¢. Since in zone IV pollen of warmth-
demanding trees is already present in appreciable amount, it might be thought that these
trees were in fact growing either in Cornwall or not far away at this time, although ap-
parently they were not in zone II. The majority of Allerod sites have been described from
basins formed as kettle-holes in the terminal moraines of the last glaciation, and we must
expect that at sites well outside the glaciation limits both stratigraphic and vegetational
phenomena will differ appreciably. The true picture can only emerge when more sites
have been examined in a peripheral region outside that where the Allerod occurs typically
developed.

It has only recently been realized how profoundly our views upon the status of the
British flora may be affected by knowledge of late-Glacial conditions and events in this
country. In particular, problems of pre-Glacial survival, immigration, and rates of migra-
tion, in many instances take a different form when seen in relation to the established oc-
currences of the late-Glacial period. As this subject has been generally considered elsewhere
