As such, Pathway Complexity bounds
the likelihood of natural occurrence by modelling a naive synthesis of the object from populations
of its basic parts, where at any time pairs of existing objects can join in a single step. In establishing
the Pathway Complexity we are asking, in this idealized world, if the number of joins required
would be low enough that we could have some population of the desired object rather than
being overwhelmed by instances of all the other structures that could be created. Of course,
some pathways may be more favoured than others (such as in chemical synthesis), but unless
we have special pathways with 100% yield of each substructure on the pathway, then that fact
merely pushes back the threshold. If we find anything significantly above the threshold, then this,
we propose, is a general biosignature. By searching for complexity alone, whether of molecules,
objects or signals, we do not have to make any assumptions about the details of the biology
or its relation to our own biology.
