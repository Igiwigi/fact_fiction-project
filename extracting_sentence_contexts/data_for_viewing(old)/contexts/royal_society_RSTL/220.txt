RoMeE! DE LISLE, the Baron de Born, LAMETHER1E, the Abbe
Havy, and indeed every other mineralogist, concur in. calling
this substance red calx: of copper; but some of them assert,
that it contains a portion of carbonic acid. Among the many
analyses which have been made of this ore, by FoxTana,
MoNNET, DE Born, RENOVANTZ, \and others, I could not find
one, that in the proportions, or even in the ingredients, resem-
bled what I had found to be its contents. The highest amount
of copper, (that given by FonTana,) does not exceed66 per
cent. and is far short of the real quantity. The remainder, as
he $tates, consists of water, and of pure and fixed airs. The
difference in the results I had obtained, together with some new
facts, which I had occasion to observe during my experiments,
induces me to treat the subject at some length; referring for its
external characters, to those mineralogists above mentioned,
who have amply described the ore, and confining myself entirely
to its chymical analysis, and some analogous experiments.

* He merely poured muriatic acid upon the ore; and, as it was entirely dissolved,
without effervescence, concluded it to be an oxide, and not a carbonate; of copper,
