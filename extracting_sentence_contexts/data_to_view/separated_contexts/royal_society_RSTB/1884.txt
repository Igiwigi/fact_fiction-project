The thick lines indicate degeneration. that on the same side. It is noteworthy that the degeneration here was less
extensive than in sections lower down, from the fact that many of the trapezoid
fibres terminate in the superior olivary bodies, and others in the nucleus of the lateral
fillet. Some of the fibres of the lateral fillet on the side opposite the lesion pass
into the posterior quadrigeminal body, while all those on the side of lesion end in the
corresponding tubercle. Tn sections through the anterior quadrigeminal region, the degeneration on the
side opposite the lesion occupied a definite position in the outer portion of the
tegmentum cruris, just mesial to the internal geniculate body and in the position of
the mesial fillet, which has here passed outward from the ventral and mesial situation
it occupies lower down.
