MANTON ON EVIDENCE ON SPIRAL STRUCTURE

visible length of the chromosome at strepsitene* (see Tables I and II, pp. 203, 205). When it is realized that there are reasons for believing that the highest value obtained
(50%, cf. p. 203) is the most reliable and that the maximum contraction of keratin and
myosin is also 50Â°% of the normal (or a) length, the coincidence becomes very
impressive. It is, in fact, so striking that it appears to be as near to proof of the correct-
ness of the analogy made as can be expected to arise in the absence of direct molecular
analysis. Discussion

The principal conclusions which have emerged from this necessarily somewhat
intricate mass of reasoning and data are the following. In the first place, it has been
shown that a chromosome is fundamentally a contorted structure, which will neither
become straight nor untwist except under special circumstances.
