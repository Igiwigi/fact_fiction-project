have to be considered, significant H-defects interactions are not expected at these temperatures : =
unless H activity in the lattice is high. But the H activity was usually considered to be low oo

assuming that it is controlled by the imposed amount of hydrogen dissolved in the primary water
(35 cm? kg~! at 320Â°C) corresponding to a fairly low hydrogen fugacity at the water/metal
interface (about 0.3 atm).

(i) Identification of the hydrogen source in primary water

In fact, two main hydrogen sources are available for metals exposed to primary water. Besides H2
dissolved in the water, as previously mentioned, the water dissociation associated with oxidation
reactions on the metal surface may be another source of hydrogen. Moreover thermodynamic
considerations on the stability of oxide films grown on alloy 600 in these conditions suggest that
the associated hydrogen fugacity could be very high.
