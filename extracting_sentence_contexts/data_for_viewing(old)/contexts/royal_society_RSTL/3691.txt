traces of the alkali, from which, however, it may be freed by washing.

When this substance is heated, it first evolves water and then oxygen, leaving a
black powder, to the nature of which I shall recur. By a very high temperature (full
white heat) it is totally reduced to the metallic state.

The analyses of this hydrated oxide when first performed led to very irreconcile-
able results, owing to two circumstances,â€”lst, that the oxide of palladium is by no
means $0 easily reduced to the metallic state by the mere agency of heat as has been
snpposed ; and 2nd, that although the precipitation of the hydrated oxide is accom-
panied with the disengagement of much carbonic acid, yet the precipitate always
contains some traces of that acid; it effervesces very distinctly when dissolved in
dilute muriatic acid, and is in fact a highly basic carbonate of palladium, rather than
a true hydrated protoxide. The following details of the experiments made as to its
composition, will place these circumstances in evidence.

A. 53-524 grains of a specimen which had been carefully washed until the liquors
ceased to react alkaline, were gently heated over the flame of a spirit-lamp, until no
more traces of water were evolved. The residue, a jet black powder, of anhydrous
oxide, weighed 45224 grains, or 84:49 per cent., having lost 15:51, apparently only
water.

B, 41-102 grains of another portion, similarly treated, gave a dry residue of 34512
grains, or 83-96 per cent. This was then heated to full redness, and when cold
weighed 31-779 grains, or 77-32 per cent.
