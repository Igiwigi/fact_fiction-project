If water-soluble chemical substances had been present they should have
been eliminated by immersion in hot water. Moreover, it cannot be said that other
characters of the host type, such as movements of the parasite larvae, outweighed any
significance attaching to a possible external odour, for hosts containing a dead parasite
were avoided to an extent equal to those containing live parasites. This is the second
point emerging from this experimentâ€”the fact that movements of the contained
parasite here play a minor part in helping the female to determine the precise nature
of the host. One cannot presume this to be general for the entire development of the
parasite, as only the limited movements of early larvae are involved here. Thirdly,
the experiment raises the problem of the suitability of the hosts chosen by the females
for the development of their progeny.
