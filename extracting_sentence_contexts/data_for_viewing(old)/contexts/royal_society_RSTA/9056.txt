In the above, the effect of barometric terms of type Q,' and Q,? was neglected, only
Qi and Q,? being considered. The nature of the diurnal term in the barometric
variation is not known very definitely, however, and it was pointed out that by
representing it in part by an oscillation of type Q,' the amplitude ratio 2°6 could be
increased : also that such an oscillation may be present in the upper layers of the
atmosphere, which do not greatly affect the barometer, even if it is not found in the
surface variation.

The term Q;' would be called on to a smaller extent if the atmospheric conductivity
is not uniform, but varies with the zenith distance (w) of the sun. In this case the
12-hour oscillation Q,? would contribute to the 24-hour magnetic variation Q,', and
the 24-hour oscillation Q,' to the 12-hour magnetic variation Q,’, but the effect would
be much more marked in the former case than in the latter. It was shown, in fact,

* Variations of higher frequency were not considered.

+ In equation (10) of the second memoir the coefficient of Ys? should be 9°23 in place of 11°16 (this
is the coefficient of yo? as found in the first memoir, p. 486).

that assuming the variation of conductivity to follow the law 1+cos w,* the ratio 2’6
would be increased to 4'7 without drawing at all on Q,.
