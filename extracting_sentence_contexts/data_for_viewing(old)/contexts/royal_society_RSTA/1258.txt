The approach via It6’s formula was once more revisited in [60], where it was finally extended
to arbitrary 2-smooth Banach spaces by exploiting the fact that, in such spaces, for 2 < p < 00
the mapping xt> ||x||? is once continuously Fréchet differentiable with a Lipschitz continuous
derivative. As it turns out, this already suffices to prove a version of the It6 formula with the
help of which the argument can be completed. This approach, however, does not seem to give the
optimal p-dependence of the constant as p — oo.

(b) The It6 formula approach revisited

The aim of the present subsection is to present the It6 formula approach to maximal estimates
for stochastic convolutions. In comparison with Theorem 5.2, it does not lead to new results (in
fact we need stronger assumptions on the evolution family and obtain non-optimal asymptotic
dependence of the constant), but this approach has the merit that it can be extended to
random Co-evolution families of contractions. To the best of our knowledge, for this setting no
maximal L?-estimates of the form (4.1) in 2-smooth spaces are available in the literature. For
stochastic evolution equations with random coefficients in Hilbert spaces subject to monotonicity
conditions, L?-maximal inequalities go back to [51,52]; for an exposition and further reference see
[53]. Some extensions to the case p # 2 have been obtained recently in [61].

In order to avoid technicalities that would obscure the line of argument we present our main
results for non-random evolution families and indicate the changes that have to be made in the 2-
dependent case in Remark 5.8. Rather than discussing the maximal L?-inequality in [60] in detail,
we will provide a detailed proof of a Gaussian tail estimate. The rationale of this choice is that
this estimate cannot be deduced (e.g. via Lemma 4.3) from the result of [60] due to the fact that it
