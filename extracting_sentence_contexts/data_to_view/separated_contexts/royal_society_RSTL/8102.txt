In their present
stage, he regards the notions he has advanced more as providing a working hypothesis
than as a final solution of the long-vexed question of the barometric tides. As a sng-
gestion, it supplies in some measure a want that has long been felt, in that it points out
a definite line of inquiry which cannot fail, if followed, to be productive of most yaluable
results. The fact that the hypothesis undesignedly forms a connexion between two
meteorological phenomena (viz. the diurnal variation of the barometer and that move-
ment of the air which Dovs has calted the ©Law of Gyration”) which have hitherto been
regarded as perfectly independent of each other, and that it simultaneously explains both,
appears to be in its favour; and it may be that it contains a germ of truth which, when
fully developed, will form no small addition to the foundations of meteorological science. MDCCCLAXIIT. D
