similar otherwise. Secondly, perhaps the photographical
(InStance questionnaire) and schematic (Yoni test) represen-
tations of the robot were semantically and temporally too
distinct from the embodied agents that the participants inter-
acted with, to detect any such differences in adopting the
intentional stance. Finally, it is worth noting that at the time
of the experiment, the Intentional Stance questionnaire was
still in development. This questionnaire may prove to be a
useful tool in detecting how readily individuals adopt the
intentional stance towards iCub. However, how this adoption
can be manipulated is still to be examined.

Potential limitations of our study include the fact that
‘changing the robot identity’ may not be high in believability.
We attempted to increase this by referring to the identities by
their names from the beginning of the experimental sessions,
by trying to give the impression that the experimenter was
working hard to achieve this change while the participants
were doing their first round of questionnaires, and by
having the robots introduce themselves with their voice
before each block. Perhaps a future study could use two


actual different robots in a counterbalanced design, even
though this will bring forward other practical challenges
