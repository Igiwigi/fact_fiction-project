The granules, moreover, may be discharged, or at least wholly disa

Then suddenly the cell will apply itself along the bacillus and, so to speak, pour
along it, being in some cases applied to one side of the rod or chain, in of
surrounding it, and yet in others fixing itself at the extremity of a baci

At first sight it seems as though these cells had taken up the bacilli, but ea
or continued examination will easily prove that this is simply an appearance, —
bacilli can, in most cases, be clearly seen to lie on or under the cell, or the cell i
to speak, folded around the bacillus, and, if from any cause the cell contracts

to the hyaline cells to be devoured. In fact, almost numberless observations h
proved to us the correctness of Mrrscunrkorr’s* statement that the eosinophile ¢
are never phagocytic. We have tempted them with charcoal, vermilion, Indian i
with many kinds of bacilli and cocci, with curare and other substances, but #
refuse all things alike. Thus the eosinophile cell comes into apposition with the bacillus and streams a
it, losing its previous spherical shape.
