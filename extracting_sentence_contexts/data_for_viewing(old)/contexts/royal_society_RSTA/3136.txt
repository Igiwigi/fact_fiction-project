Then the local invariance defect of Grad’s approximation vanishes,
Alge — 0. (5.12)

Indeed, with the conditions (5.10) and (5.11), the relaxation terms in Grad’s approximation
become Rey =)" dag and Rig = —141qq. Using these in (5.9), we prove (5.12).

Non-vanishing of the local invariance defect for Grad’s distribution function is the first
apparent difference from the Maxwellian case. In Grad’s case, the relaxation has to be aligned with
the direction dictated by the eigenfunction of the linearized collision integral in order to annihilate
the local invariance defect. This is more demanding than the local Maxwellian, which annuls the
local terms in the invariance defect independently of the collision model used. Vanishing of the
local invariance defect unifies the relaxation time approximation (and any similar kinetic model)
with Maxwell’s molecules and is a consequence of the simple fact that all these have the same
eigenfunctions of the form (5.10) and (5.11). Vanishing of the local invariance defect has no relation
to the values of transport coefficients, and is non-vanishing for any other model, such as hard
spheres. We shall return to the discussion of the local invariance defect and the corresponding
correction in §9; for now, we proceed with the analysis of the non-local part of the invariance
defect which is independent of the choice of the collision model.

6. Non-local invariance defect of Grad’s approximation

(a) Natural partition of the non-local invariance defect

The non-local part of the invariance defect shall be written as the sum of three pieces, where we
distinguish the NSE, the linear and the nonlinear contributions,
