The Berry phase for a cyclically evolving pure state equals half of the solid angle enclosed
by the curve traced out by the stateâ€™s Bloch vector on the Bloch sphere. Using this observation,
it is fairly easy to calculate the interferometric phase for cyclically evolving qubits, provided
they do not pass the maximally mixed state. In fact, we believe that the parallelism condition
in equation (5.2) cannot be extended to include all curves that pass through the maximally mixed
state. However, this is still under investigation. Figure 6.
