The foxglove certainly exhibits far the
highest and most significant association. Two out of the three species give a positive
result, and if all the species are pooled together the result is positive. The fact is we
are looking, in all probability, for a very small association, and extensive experiments
may be necessary to render its existence certain. Taking the above results together,
I should certainly say they gave evidence on the whole of a positive association. The
