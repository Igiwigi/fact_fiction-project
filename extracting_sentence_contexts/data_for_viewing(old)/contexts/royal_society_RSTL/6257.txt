a part yolatilizes; and on re-fusing the alloy formed, if a large quantity of arsenic has
been used, it has a dingy grey colour, and is very hard and brittle. We managed to
draw an alloy containing 5:40 per cent. of arsenic to the diameter of 0-29 millim. ; and

+ We repeated this experiment seyeral times, but could not again make the alloy. In all probability,
therefore, the carbon found was only mechanically mixed with copper.

had we had draw-plates with finer holes at our disposal, we might have drawn it much
finer,—a fact, which does not at all agree with the assertions lately made, that copper
with a small amount of arsenic cannot be drawn into fine wire. The arsenic was deter-
mined as arseniate of magnesia. The following values show that arsenic greatly reduces
the conducting power of copper :—
