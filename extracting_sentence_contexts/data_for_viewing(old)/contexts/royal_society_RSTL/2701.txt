DR. PHILIP ON THE POWERS OF LIFE, 345

in judging of the nature of the nervous influence, and consequently of other func-
tions of the living animal beside the function of the muscular fibre.

The powers of the nervous system properly 80 called, which cooperate with the
muscular fibre in all the more complicated functions, next demand our attention ;
and it will appear that there is no other branch of physiology in which the generally
received opinions have been, and indeed still are, 80 much at variance with simple
matter of fact.

That what in common language is called the nervous system embraces two distinct
sets of organs is evident ; because not only do the functions of the sensorial and
nervous organs, properly s0 called, essentially differ in their nature; but, as we shall

S find, their localities also are different. Now it has generally been taught that the
© neryous functions, properly 80 called, only administer to those of the sensorial
Z power; that they are limited to the conveyance of impressions to and from the sen-
= 8orial organs, and to the excitement of the muscles of voluntary motion®.

5 I shall in the first place inquire into the nature of the functions of the nervous
- system properly s0 called, and then endeavour to ascertain to what parts of that
