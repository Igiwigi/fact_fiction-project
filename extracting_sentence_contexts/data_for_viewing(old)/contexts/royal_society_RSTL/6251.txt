On the Electric Conducting Power of Pure Gold,

The values given for the conducting power of pure gold, in my paper © On the Elec-
tric Conducting Power of the Metals,” is not quite correct, as the gold from some
cause cannot have been chemically pure; although prepared with the greatest care by
Dr. MiyBoow, yet the wire-drawer in all probability fused it in a crucible which had
been previously used; and as only 3 to 4 grms. were purified, a very small amount of
impurity would account for the difference which I have lately found. At the time the
values appeared very low, compared with those of other experimenters, but it was then
thought that the higher ones were due to traces of silyver. Experiments, however, have
proved, on the contrary, that most of the gold-silver, gold-copper, &c. alloys conduct
electricity worse than pure gold; and that, in fact, only those which contain less than
2 per cent. gold in gold-silver alloys, and about 3 per cent. gold in gold-copper alloys,
conduct better than pure gold.

Thus chemically-pure gold, prepared by dissolving gold from the refiners in nitro-
hydrochloric acid, precipitating with algaroth powder, washing alternately with nitric
and hydrochloric acids, redissolving in nitrohydrochloric acid, precipitating by sul-
phurous acid, washing alternately with nitric and hydrochloric acids, and fusing in a
muffle with nitrate of potash, gave, compared with a hard drayn silver wire =100 at 0*C.,
