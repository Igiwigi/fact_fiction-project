Fic. 8.—European Eel (Anguilla vulgaris) ; curve showing rate of growth of Larvae.

The result may be briefly expressed as follows :—The larvae were found all across
the Atlantic Ocean, coastal waters excepted, but only north of the 20th degree of
lat. N. In the easternmost part of the Atlantic, they extend northwards beyond the
60th degree of latitude. These facts will give an idea of the great extent of the area
in which larvee of our European eel occur.

The starting-point for the trans-oceanic migration of the larvee is the area encircled
by the heavily-drawn line in the chart fig. 4. If the annual production of eel larvee
only occupied a very brief period, say 1 month, and provided that all individuals came
from the same spot and made equal progress, alike in their growth and in their move-
ment eastwards, then it would be an easy matter to indicate the position of each
particular stage of development in the ocean by curves representing the average
lengths of the specimens. As it is, neither of these conditions is fulfilled, and it is
difficult, therefore, to draw up a clear and simple chart of the material. After various
experiments in this direction, I have adopted the method of noting on a large chart
the minimum length of the specimens found at each station, these values being then
