764. From all the experiments, combined with these considerations, I conclude that
muriatic acid is decomposed by the direct influence of the electric current, and that
the quantities evolved are, and therefore the chemical action is, definite for a definite
quantity of electricity. For though I have not collected and measured the chlorine, in
its separate state, at the anode, there can exist no doubt as to its being proportional
to the hydrogen at the cathode ; and the results are therefore sufficient to establish the
general law of constant electro-chemical action in the case of muriatic acid.

765. In the dilute acid (761.), I conclude that a part of the water is electro-chemi-
cally decomposed, giving origin to the oxygen, which appears mingled with the chlo-
rine at the anode. The oxygen may be viewed as a secondary result ; but I incline to
believe that it is not 80: for, if it were, it might be expected in largest proportion
from the stronger acid, whereas the revyerse is the fact. 'This consideration, with
others, also leads me to conclude that muriatic acid is more easily decomposed by
the electric current than water ; since, eyen when diluted with eight or nine times its
quantity of the latter fluid, it alone gives way, the water remaining unaffected.

766. Chlorides—On using solutions of chlorides in water, —for instance, the chlo-
rides of sodium or calcium,—there was eyolution of chlorine only at the positive elec-
trode, and of hydrogen, with the oxide of the base, as soda or lime, at the negative
electrode. The process of decomposition may be viewed as proceeding in two or
three ways, all terminating in the same results. Perhaps the simplest is to consider
the chloride as the substance electrolyzed, its chlorine being determined to and
evolved at the anode, and its metal passing to the cathode, where, finding no more
chlorine, it acts upon the water, producing hydrogen and an oxide as secondary re-
