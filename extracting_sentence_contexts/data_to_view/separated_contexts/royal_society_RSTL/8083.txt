The obtuse angle containing the positive bisector gave measurements

A In the neighbourhood of the bisector of the obtuse angle of the optic axes difficulties of the same kind present
hemselves. Tt is, in fact, established by the simultaneous maximum extinction of the light in both parts of a twin
ormed of two plates parallel tom,of which the faces parebrought togetherin oppositepositions, that the plane of the

x68 is parallel to the edge 2, which should be a little oblique to the positive bisector, inasmuch as the coloured
m

ings 8een in oil through the faces m do not seem to be at the same Aistance from the normal to these faces. Phe poxition of the bisector itself could not, however, be precisely determined ; for even when plates inclined at
about 72 or 8? upon m, as nearly as possible perpendicular to the plane of the axes, were used, it was 8carcely
poxsible to measure with any exactitude in oil the angle that each of them makes with a normal common to

the plates and to the edge — P. $ome experiments led to the conclusion that this normal made with the positive

bisector an angle of about p- to 59.
