those which have been shown above to be consequent upon a continuous diminution
in the density of a gold film, which throughout remains either amorphous or
“ granular” (i.e., possessing a microstructure of small spheres). The view that the
film is initially amorphous or granular, and that heating diminishes its density, is
supported, as has already been pointed out,* by the fact that the curves in figs. 8
and 10 show that the absorption of light increases rapidly as » begins to diminish
from unity, while Berisy’s films exhibited just such an increase of absorptive power
when first heated. This view is also in accordance with the loosening of structure
which is suggested by the great decrease in electric conductivity which accompanies
heating. But direct evidence of the correctness of the view that heating produces
decrease in density is not wanting, for Berpyt has estimated the thickness of a film
which had been annealed to the purple stage.
