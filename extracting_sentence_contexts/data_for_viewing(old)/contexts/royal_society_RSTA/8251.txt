History of the Problem.

6. The earliest discussion of hydrodynamic stability appears to be that given by
Hetmuorrz, who showed that, in an inviscid liquid, a surface at which the velocity
is discontinuous will be essentially unstable.* In 1879, RayLEIcH applied a method
due to KeLvin to investigate more precisely the character of the instability.t It soon
appeared that the calculations failed in one important respect to correspond with the
facts, and the explanation was suspected to lie in the assumption of discontinuous
changes of velocity, which in a real fluid, by reason of viscosity, must instantly
disappear.{ Accordingly, in succeeding papers,§ RayercH modified his assumptions
in regard to the steady motion, and dealt with laminar systems in which, although the
vorticity varied abruptly, the velocities were taken to be continuous. His most general
conclusion relates to infinitesimal disturbances in two dimensions : ‘* The steady motion
of a non-viscous liquid in two dimensions between fixed parallel plane walls is stable
provided that the velocity U, everywhere parallel to the walls and a function of y only,
is such that d?U/dy? is of one sign throughout, y being the co-ordinate measured
perpendicularly to the walls.”’)|

motion seems to have been first suggested by Sroxrs, ‘Camb. Phil. Soc. Trans.,’ vol. 8, p, 105 (1843).
