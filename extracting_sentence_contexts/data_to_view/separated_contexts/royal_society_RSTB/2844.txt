These experiments would seem to indicate clearly: (1) that the mammalian
respiratory centre can be directly poisoned by Cobra venom; (2) that the phrenic

nerve-ends remain quite unaffected, or at least non-paralysed (a) in animals which
have been poisoned by large intravenous doses of venom, and (b) in those which have
received doses of venom subcutaneously not greatly above the lethal, and which have
taken 4 or 5 hrs. to die; (3) that the phrenic nerve-ends can be paralysed by the
administration of large lethal doses of venom, provided that the animal be kept alive
long enough by artificial respiration. Ragorzr observed that the diaphragm contracted more feebly as death approached,
and argued from this that the phrenic nerve-ends were paralysed. But a central
paralysis might equally explain this phenomenon if it be a fact. Then again, could
Racorat really cut off the blood supply of the snout for a long period (such as is
demanded to produce nerve-end paresis, according to his own admission) without at
the same time damaging the nutrition of the nerves and muscles he was studying ? He used an iron ring for the compression of the parts.
