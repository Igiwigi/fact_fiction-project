But the loss of tactile sensation is eyen more conclusively indicated by the fact that
monkeys in whom the hippocampal region was destroyed ceased to use the opposite
limbs for the purposes of prehension or the exercise of the faculty of touch. To react to tactile stimuli may signify reflex action or tactile sensation, or both ; to
touch necessarily, implies the possession of the power of tactile perception,

The condition of the limbs in these cases was such as to simulate motor paralysis; and
it is well known that Sir CuarLes BELL mistook the immobility of the side of the face
resulting. from anzesthesia caused by division of sensory branches of the fifth for real
motor paralysis. It was pointed out by Mayo that, owing to the loss of tactile sensation,
an animal has no indication for the regulation and adaptation of its muscular moyements,
and hence ceases to make them. [That anzsthesia, and not motor paralysis, existed on
the side opposite the destruction of the hippocampus, is shown by the fact that a certain
degree of voluntary motion was retained, 'The animal (Exp. XVIII.) whose leg was
anwsthetic could replace it on the perch, though it continually tended to slip off when
the animal withdrew its attention from it. There was no muscular flaccidity as in true motor paralysis, nor was there any appear-
ance of facial distortion, such as would have been produced by motor paralysis of one side.
