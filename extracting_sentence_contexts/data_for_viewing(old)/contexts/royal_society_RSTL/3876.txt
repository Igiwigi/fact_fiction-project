easily induced, and are of longest duration in those animals of low organization in
which the volume of brain bears the smallest proportion to that of the whole neryous
system, in which also volition and sensation are of small amount, and which have the
body formed of the greatest number of similar uniform parts or segments#.

2. Tas CiRcULATORY SYSTEM.

The existence of a motion of the fluids in the Articulata has long been known to
the microscopic observer. So long ago as the middle of the last century it was seen
by BakxerT in the limbs of some insects. But notwithstanding this, and the evidence
of a distinct pulsatory action of the great dorsal vessel, as seen through the tegument
in the larvz of insects, the existence of a true circulation of the fluids in them and
some of the neighbouring classes was doubted until the fact was demonstrated by
Carvs}, and afterwards by Wacnzrh. Yet the means by which this circulation is

* While this paper has been passing through the press, I have repeated these experiments, on the functions
of the brain and cord, with still more conclusive results on the Coleoptera, Orthoptera, Hymenoptera, Neuro-
ptera, Diptera, and other hexapod insects. The cord was divided between the first and second pair of legs.
The two poxterior pairs of legs were immediately deprived of volition, and exhibited only reflex actions, while
the anterior pair gave marked indications of being as completely under the influence of yolition and sensation
as in the uninjured animal. The cord was then divided between the first pair of legs and medulla oblongata,
when these legs also were deprived of volition, and exhibited only reflex actions like the posterior,

Other experiments made on the brain itself, by removing that organ, or by simply separating it from the me-
dulla oblongata and cord, without decapitating the insect, fully confirmed the experiments on the Myria-
