in the third 9 inchesâ€”making 183 lbs. per acre more than on Plot 11, as against
54 lbs. expected accumulation.


POTASH IN WHEAT SOILS OF BROADBALK FIELD, ROTHAMSTED. 285

Passing on to the 1893 samples, when there should, by calculation, be now a
deficit of 92 lbs. of potash per acre, compared with Plot 11, we begin to lose some of
our accumulation. The surface soil yields much less citric-acid-soluble potash than in
1881, but the second and third depths maintain their superiority, leaving (compared
with Plot 11) a balance to the good of 76 lbs. per acre of easily soluble potash in the
27 inches of soil, as against a calculated deficiency, owing to cropping, of 92 Ibs.
From these facts, as well as from the higher output of potash from this soil, there
seems to be little doubt that the magnesium sulphate, like the sodium sulphate, has
acted as a potash solvent, but to an appreciably greater extent, especially in the
subsoil.

We now pass on to Plot 13, which has received, in addition to ammonium salts and
superphosphate, a liberal annual dressing of potash far in excess of the demands of the
crop. The excess of supply of potash per acre over the output of potash in the crops
should leave the plot richer than Plot 11 to the extent of 2021 lbs, per acre in 1865,
of 3222 lbs. per acre in 1881, and 4052 lbs. per acre in 1893. We find soluble in
citric acid solution, in the 27 inches of soil, compared with Plot 11, an excess of
629 lbs. per acre in 1865, of 828 lbs. in 1881, and of 827 lbs. in 1893. At the end of
the two earlier periods this excess is nearly all found in the first and second 9 inches,
