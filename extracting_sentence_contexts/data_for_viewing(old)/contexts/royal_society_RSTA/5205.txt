of particle physics. This approach was strongly motivated by the impressive success of the SM
for describing, often to an astonishing degree of precision, the very large set of experimental
observations in particle physics experiments.

The SM is a quantum field theory, built on the powerful principle of gauge invariance [9-11].
It describes the fundamental building blocks of matter (quarks and leptons), as well as the
interactions among them which are mediated by gauge bosons, which are particles with unit
spin. The mediator of the electromagnetic interaction is the photon, the mediators of the strong
interaction among quarks inside protons and neutrons are the gluons, while the gauge bosons
responsible for weak interactions are the heavy W and Z bosons. Indeed, the fact that the W and Z
bosons are so massive, while the photon is massless, is a manifestation of the breaking of electroweak
symmetry, which is at the heart of the unification of electromagnetic and weak interactions. This
has resulted in a plethora of theoretical attempts (not only in the 1960s) to find mechanisms that
can explain this breaking of electroweak symmetry and, if possible, to also explain how the matter : =
particles acquire mass, while at the same time preserving all the good properties of the theory, in 3
particular gauge symmetry and renormalizability. One ‘simple’ solution to this problem consists
in the introduction of an additional scalar (spin zero) particle, called the Higgs boson, which nee)
interacts with matter particles and gauge bosons and thus explains their masses in a dynamical :
manner. Obviously, for many years, the main question remained that if this particle exists, if [4
indeed it exists at all, what its mass would be. Indeed, while the SM predicts all relevant details DN
regarding the interaction of the Higgs boson with other particles, it does not predict its mass. Only =
experiment would be able to give a definite answer. :8
