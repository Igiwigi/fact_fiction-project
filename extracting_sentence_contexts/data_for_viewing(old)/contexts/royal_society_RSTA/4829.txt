We see, immediately, noting vanishing of the Lie derivative of I?’ with respect to this vector field
(and its zero homogeneity, whereby Y is also preserved) that this infinitesimal shift preserves the
I-structure. When exponentiated, this provides us with a space PT which encodes a genuinely
curved complex 4-space V.

It turns out that any complex-Riemann coformally anti-self-dual complex 4-space solution of
the Einstein (A-)vacuum equations can be locally described from such a deformed twistor space
with a globally defined I-structure. How does this work? First, we need the ‘lines’ within a PT
(obtained by such means). I cannot go into full details here, but theorems of Kodaira and others
can be invoked to establish the fact that spaces PT, constructed in this way (and not deviating too
far from the initial PP C PT) contain a complex 4-parameter family of ‘lines’ defined solely by the
fact that they are imbedded Riemann spheres, with complex structure inherited from the ambient
PT and belonging to the appropriate topological family, these lines being represented as the points



of the space V. An explicit geometrical procedure involving T’s I-structure then naturally assigns
a complex-Riemannian metric g to V [6,8], where g turns out to be anti-self-dual and Einstein.
(The complex-conformal anti-self-dual metric of V is defined by PT’s complex-manifold structure,
even without 7’s I-structure, simply from the fact that intersecting lines in PT correspond to
null-separated points in V [6,8].)
