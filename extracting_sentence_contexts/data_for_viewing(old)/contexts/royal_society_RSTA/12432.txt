and fand f, will be determined from the values of / and /, in a manner that will be
described later on. AIl thermal phenomena not determined by F, and all forces of the
nature of friction, will be supposed given by a third function X, given by

where x, 2, unlike f, f,, do not in any way depend upon L. The way in which these
forces and the thermal phenomena depend upon X will be explained later. We shall
call X the dissipation function. It is, in fact, a generalisation of Lord RayLeicu’s
dissipation function (‘Theory of Sound,’ Ist ed., § 81).

All electric and magnetic phenomena are supposed ultimately to depend upon the
magnitudes and rates of variation of two fluxes (§7), d, k, called respectively the
dielectric displacement and the conduction displacement. The whole displacement,
