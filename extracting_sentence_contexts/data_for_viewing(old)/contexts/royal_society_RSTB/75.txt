as the rectum, but its inner walls are smooth and different in structure from the
rectum. Into the dorso-lateral sides the ureters open separately, just above a promi-
nent papilla. This chamber is either empty, or filled with the clear, almost colourless
urine, which can distend this “ urinary chamber” into an oval shape of very large
size. It never contains feces, which only pass through it. Such a chamber is
peculiar to the Crocodilia. At the first glance we should compare it either to the
chamber UD, or, because of its shape and partial function, to the chamber CD of

Saurians and Birds, but in neither case would the folds bordering its cephalic and
caudal ends correspond with those of the other Sauropida. In fact the urinary
compartment described above is homologous with the chambers UD and CD of the
Saurians, Snakes, and Birds. This I am able to prove by the condition of things
prevailing in very young, but already hatched, Crocodilia (fig. 23). In Alligator
mississipiensis (snout to anus 13 ems.) the ureters open into a small roundish chamber,
which is bordered head- and tailwards by a high and very prominent circular fold,
The fold towards the head is situated closely above the urinary orifices, and leads into
a slightly larger chamber, CD, the inner walls of which are very irregular through
high longitudinal and oblique folds; the lumen of this chamber CD is small, and
shows the same internal structure as the rectum above, from which it is separated by
another prominent und very thick fold. Externally both chambers CD and UD are
surrounded by a powerful layer of chiefly circular muscles, which mark the termina-
tion of the rectum very distinctly, and give the chambers UD and CD the external
