ON THE ARAUCARIEA, RECENT AND EXTINCT. 395

would extend the limits of our paper beyond reasonable bounds. Mr. Worspe.t’s
contribution to the “ Annals of Botany” on this subject constitutes a comprehensive
and exceedingly useful digest of the growth of the several views and of the facts on
which they are based.*

The main question with which we are concerned is this: considering the cones of
the Araucariex per se, what interpretation of their structure is most in accordance
with facts; are we to regard them as practically inseparable from the cones of the
Abietineze from the point of view of morphology, or may we consider them on their
merits as representing a type which may or may not fall into line with other forms of
female shoots met with among Conifers ?

We prefer to consider the cones of Agathis and Araucaria as types to be inter-
preted apart from such considerations as have been founded on the structure of the
more complex type represented by Pinus or Abies. This preference is based on the
following considerations :—

The Araucariez are, we believe, older than the Abietinese and in many respects
they afford what we consider satisfactory evidence in favour of the view that they
constitute a more primitive branch of the Gymnosperms. It is the Abietineous cone
