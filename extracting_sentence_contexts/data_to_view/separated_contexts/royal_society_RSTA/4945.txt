x We divide our experiments into three series, but only attach any value to the

S third, as during the first two sets the thermometer was falling in the last period. 8 We had hoped, at first, to be able to apply a small correction, to eliminate the error

E which is due to the fact that a falling thermometer will read too high, and we made

& Ba large number of experiments to determine the correction. We arrived, however, at

S % the result that the indications of a falling thermometer are so irregular that no

â€˜e correction is possible. Consequently in our third series the thermometer was rising

wduring the whole course of each experiment.
