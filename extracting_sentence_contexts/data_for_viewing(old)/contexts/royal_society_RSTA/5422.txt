o pioneering research on self-organization, helping to introduce complexity
in biology.

Self-organized criticality (SOC), proposed by Bak (1996), which was also
formulated on the basis of CA, mixes two apparently essential ingredients of
complex systems: self-organization, that is formation of spatio-temporal patterns
without external tuning, and criticality that, as in the critical point of phase
ransitions, is characterized by power-law scalings and divergent susceptibility-
ike quantities, allowing the system to react drastically to changes in its
environment. Employed to describe a wide variety of phenomena, SOC could
ye one of the mechanisms yielding complex behaviour in nature.

In fact, to envisage life as being very plastic, in the sense of quick and even
strong responses to the surrounding changes, has its roots in nonlinearity. In
he 1970s, first work by researchers such as Robert May, George Oster, James
York, among others, on the logistic equation for population dynamics, found
he rich realistic phenomenology taking place when deterministic chaos is a key
factor in biological systems. Moreover, since its development by Mandelbrot
1983), the concept of fractals has become very useful to interpret different
diological processes (Kauffman 1993; Kaandorp 1994; Losa et al. 1994), from
morphogenesis, to allometry in metabolism, going from patterns in cardiac rythms
o the properties of the time series from brain signalling.

In former times, system components have been modelled as being identical,
which is at odds with the typical heterogeneity of realistic complex systems.
