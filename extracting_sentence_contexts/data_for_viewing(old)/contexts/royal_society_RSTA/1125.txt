Note that none of the eigenvalues A2,...,A) are equal to zero, i.e. zero is a simple eigenvalue
of T. Indeed, let H denote the graph of which adjacency matrix AB is defined by AH ik = Tk for

j#k. By condition (ii) we have All = =0 if and only if A= =0. This means that E(H) = E(H) and

therefore H has a spanning diverging tree: by proposition 4.2 the eigenvalue 0 of the Laplacian
matrix of Hi (i.e. of the matrix —T) is simple, which means that 0 is a simple eigenvalue of T.
We also remark that by condition (ii) and by the Gershgorin circle theorem, all the eigenvalues
of G(T) belong to the discs centred in Tj <0 and of radius —Tj,. We can thus conclude that the
eigenvalues Az,...,4y have all a negative real part and so 2t- 1+ 6° is an asymptotically stable
relative equilibrium. a

In fact proposition 4.3 can be generalized to (1.1) in a similar way.

Corollary 4.4. Assume that H € H(A) admits a spanning diverging tree. Then there is a coupling
function g such that (1.1) has an asymptotically stable relative equilibrium (Qt + 07,...,2t+ OX)
satisfying Gga(6°) =H. In other words, there exists a coupling function g that stably realizes H for (1.1).

Proof. The proof works in an exactly similar way as in proposition 4.3. Under the same
conditions (i), (ii), (iii) above, the linearized equation at 2t- 1+ 0° reads

=H 1 Anal gf — ORM xj — Xd, 1SKSN,
j=l

and the coefficients of the corresponding Laplacian matrix T are
