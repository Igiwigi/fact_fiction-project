E The surprising passage of gases through the homogeneous snbstance of a plate of fused
Jatinum or of iron at a red heat, lately discovered by MM. H. STe.-CLaie DEVILLE and
E 008T, may possibly prove to be analogous in its mode of occurrence to the passage of
ases through the rubber septum. At the same time it must be admitted that 8wch an
> pothesis as that of liquefaction can only be applied in a general and somewhat vague
Zanner to bodies s0 elastic and yolatile at an elevated temperature as the gases generally
aust be, and hydrogen in particular. Still some degree of absorbing and liquefying
wer can scarcely be denied to a soft or liquid substance, in whatever circumstances it
Bay be found, with such a patent fact, before us as the retention by fused silver of 18 or
) volumes of oxygen at a red heat. It may safely be assumed that the tendency of
ses to liquefaction, however much abated by temperature, is too essential a property of
atter to be ever entirely obliterated.
= A little consideration also shows that the absorption of gas by a liquid or by a colloid
Sbstance is not a purely physical effect. The absorption appears to require 80me
Slation in compositionâ€”as where both the gas and the liquid are hydrocarbons, and the
affinity or attraction of solution can come into play. May a similar analogy be looked
for, of hydrogen to liquid or colloid bodies of the metallic class !

With reference to the mechanical pores of a solid mass, liquids are probably more
penetrating than gases. 'The former show often a power of adhesion to solids, while
*gases appear to be essentially repulsive. A degree of minute porosity is conceivable,
