deavouring to explain why, in the particular case described above, the alkali should
produce an increase of deflection in the proper current of the pile of entire frogs.
For myself, I incline to the belief that stronger and more permanent contractions
being excited by the alkali than by acids, the contact between one element and the
other becomes thereby more intimately established in the greater number of cases,
and, by tbat ineans, the internal conducting power is increased. In effect, this contact
is very imperfectly established in the pile of entire frogs, and very great difference in
the intensity of the current is perceptible with the same elements by improving their
mutual contact.

Whatever may be the right interpretation of the slight increase which occurs in
the intensity of the proper current, on touching the lumbar plexuses of the frogs,
and thus exciting muscular contractions, certainly this fact alone is insufficient to

lead us to admit the evolution of electricity during muscular contraction, while, as
certainly, all the other cases described oblige us to conclude the contrary.

I will now proceed to detail several other new researches upon the phenomenon of
induced contractions: but I must first entreat that the reader will excuse my tres-
passing on his time with a lengthened account of my numerous experiments : the fact
of induced contractions is certainly of snch importance, and at the same time 80
obscure, that it cannot be established except by long and patient researches,
