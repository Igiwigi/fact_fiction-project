By contrast, the
resource-generated amplification of risk is shown along the bottom of figure 2. Here, perceived
risks play a key role. The various linkages between these pathways illustrate the fact that they do
not act in isolation. A key difference between the two mechanisms is that, in resource-generated transmission,
climate triggers perceived risks that may or may not exist in reality; whereas in climatically
generated risk transmission, climate acts as a real systematic pattern across time and/or space,
which may or may not be measured, or even detectable. One mechanism is rooted in perception
(social risk) and the other is rooted in the climate system.
