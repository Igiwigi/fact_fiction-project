When Tycuo Braue advanced the above theory, the tails of comets were looked
upon as similar in constitution to the Milky Way.

Support of the Hypothesis by Krrier.

Kep.er agreed with TycHo in considering that new stars were created from
the ethereal substance of which the Milky Way was composed. The circumstance
that Mira Ceti, which was looked upon as a Nova, appeared in a part of the heavens
