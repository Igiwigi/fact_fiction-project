But note
that in order to really be analogous to the cultural case, the switch
needs to happen in response to new evolutionary affordances, and it
needs to be reversible to count as equally content-dependent. It
goes beyond the scope of this paper to determine whether that
applies to the case. An anonymous referee has pointed to the fact
that for viruses it can indeed happen in a responsive and reversible
manner, giving further credence to a by-now standard comparison
of ideas and viruses. The figure has one glitch: it classifies parental effects as cases of
inheritance. Although parental effects influence gene expression
and although they can be inherited, they are not qua being parental
a case of inheritance, as Merlin [36] argues.
