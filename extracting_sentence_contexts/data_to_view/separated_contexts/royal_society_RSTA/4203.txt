In the early tables of Ricurer (1795) and of Daron (1810) the density is given
to two places of decimals. A more ambitious table was published by TUNNERMANN |
in 1827 (‘Neues Journal der Pharmacie fiir Aertzte,’ vol. 18, p. 2), in which the
percentages of Na,O were given to three places of decimals (1 part in 30,000) and the
densities to four ; the additional accuracy of this table is for the most part fictitious,
as errors are to be found even in the second place of decimals. T&iNNERMANN’S values,
in conjunction with those of Daron, were, however, made use of 30 years later by
Scurrr (‘ Annalen,’ 1858, vol. 107, p. 300), who deduced from them a formula con-
necting density with concentration, his object being to obtain by extrapolation a value
for the density of fused 100-per cent.
