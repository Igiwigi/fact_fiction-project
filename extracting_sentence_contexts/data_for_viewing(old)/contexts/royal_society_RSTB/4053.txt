haemoglobin were the same. But the hemoglobin percentage was increased by about
19 per cent. in our cases on Pike’s Peak; hence the difference in percentage satura-
tion between arterial and venous blood would only be 82 x 4?§ = 27 per cent., instead
of 32 per cent. as at sea-level. The arterial blood after acclimatisation was 95 per
cent. saturated, as against 96 per cent. at sea-level. Hence the venous blood would
be 95-27 = 68 per cent. saturated on Pike’s Peak, as compared with 62 per cent. at
sea-level. The oxygen pressure corresponding to 62 per cent. saturation on the
dissociation curve (fig. 10) is 3671 mm., as against 39°5 mm. at 68 per cent. In the
case of persons with a greater increase in the hemoglobin percentage (for instance,
Ropison or Drviney, who were living on Pike’s Peak) the excess of venous oxygen
pressure would be still greater. If we calculate the mean oxygen pressure in the
blood of the capillaries the result is still in favour of the blood on Pike’s Peak, in spite
of the fact that the initial oxygen pressure at sea-level would be greater for a moment.
Even if we take into account the fact that the blood loses a good deal less oxygen in
the central neryous system than in the muscles, the calculation shows no diminution in
the capillary oxygen pressure on Pike's Peak as compared with that at sea-level.

We thus seem forced to the conclusion that the continued stimulus of oxygen want
cannot be explained by mere reference to diminished saturation of the hemoglobin,
or correspondingly diminished arterial oxygen pressure. At lower altitudes the same
