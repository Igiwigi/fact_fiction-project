case, whereas the musicians gave lower confidence ratings.
Pelofi et al. argued that musicians were more likely to hear
out components within the complex tones, and hence detec-
ted the ambiguity, perhaps unconsciously. In contrast, the
non-musicians probably heard the complex sound as a
whole, and did not detect the ambiguity.

Social deficits and communication difficulties may be partly
explained by individual variability in both basic auditory abil-
ities and in scene analysis abilities. In this issue, Lin et al. [16]
report that people diagnosed with ASD are characterized by
difficulty in acquiring relevant auditory and visual informa-
tion in daily environments, despite the fact that people
with ASD have normal audiometric thresholds and normal
visual acuity. People diagnosed with ASD appear to perceive
the world differently than ‘normal’ people, sometimes
having superior abilities in discriminating details of a scene
while having difficulties in judging or discriminating more
global properties. There may also be substantial and consistent
individual differences within those diagnosed with ASD. Inter-
estingly, a comparison of the characteristics of scene analysis
between auditory and visual modalities in people with ASD
reveals some essential commonalities, which could provide
clues for the underlying neural mechanisms of ASD.
