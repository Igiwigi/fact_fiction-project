I preserved this egg confined to one spot in a minute glass capsule, and in exactly
the same position beneath the microscope, for forty-eight hours. During the first
three quarters of an hour many of the spermatozoa on its surface exhibited as vivid
motions as at first, but still adhered to the same parts, and had not, so far as I could
perceive, changed their posture or their place in the least, or had penetrated in the
slightest degree into the envelope. At the end of twelye hours I found that the yelk
had undergone the usual process of cleavage, which, at that time, had already been
advanced to the stage of coarse granulation of the surface, a fact which proved most
distinetly that this egg had been impregnated. Spermatozoa were still distinetly
recognized over the whole surface of the envelope, but their motions had now ceased.
On the following morning, May 20th, the changes were found to have proceeded un-
interruptedly, as the yelk was then finely granulated over its whole snrface. At a
little later period, the end of twenty-four hours, a Å¿ew spermatozoa were still adhering
to the surface of the envelope, but the whole were perfectly motionless, and many
had evidently disappeared. Still, not one could be detected in the substance or in
the chamber of the envelope. At twenty-eight hours the granulation of the yelk was
nearly completed, and its surface was becoming smooth, and there were till a very
few motionless spermatozoa on the exterior of the envelope. At the end of forty-eight
hours, May 21st, I was still able to recognize the bodies of several spermatozoa which
had not yet disappeared, but which had become very indistinct, as if in a state of
