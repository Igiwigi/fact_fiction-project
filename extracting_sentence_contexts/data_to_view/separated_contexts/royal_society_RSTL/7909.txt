It is also interesting to remark the different manner in which
changes of the attendant circumstances affect the strains of the two classes of ironclads
represented by the © Minotaur ' and the © Bellerophon.” The reader can trace these for
himself; I would simply call attention to the fact that when aground and supported at
the extremities the maximum bending-moments bear very nearly the same proportions to
the products of the lengths and displacements, notwithstanding the very different distri-
bution of the weight in the two ships. This similarity is mainly due to the fact that the
centres of gravity of the fore and after bodies in the two ships are very nearly the same
part of the length of these bodies distant from the bow and stern. For example, in the
* Minotaur ' the centre of gravity of the fore body is 116 feet distant from the bow, and
the fore body is 201 feet long, these quantities being very nearly in the ratio of 3 to 5;
while in the © Bellerophon ' the centre of gravity is 90 feet from the bow, and the length
of the fore body is 144 feet, the ratio between these quantities being nearly the same as
before. Our third example is drawn from the * Victoria and Albert,” in which ship the centre
of gravity is about 157 feet from the bow and 143 feet from the stern.
