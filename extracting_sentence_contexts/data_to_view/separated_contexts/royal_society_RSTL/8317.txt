Thus,
yhile on the one hand we see cause to believe that some of the bones may not be in
lgir original position, yet on the other hand, in case of the bones occurring together, it
EY not follow (owing to causes we have before referred to) that because they differ in
= character they are necessarily of a different age. It is evident that as other con-
tons besides those of age and imbedding, such as previous weathering or stalagmitic
Sting, influence the fossilization of the Bkidnt it must be difficult to decide upon the
Bits of error to which such differences of condition may give rise. Though the fact of
I@ variations in the state of the bones may be ascribed to several canses and does not
itnte the argument of antiquity, still it may be better to eliminate all such doubtful
s (and after all it is the general condition and aspect of the bulk of the remains
Fon which we must, in the main depend), although the exceptions, even admitted, will
found to be 80 few as hardly to affect the main question at isne, whether as regards
he actual or the relative age of the mammalian remains generally. Fhis group of cave-animals may be referred to a late quaternary period, probably coeval
73h and prolonged beyond that of the raised beach which in places fringes the south
0 of England; for mammalian remains of the same species have been found in the
1Bble beds which overly the raised beaches of Plymouth, Brighton, and elsewhere. Ve now have to consider another question sought to be settled by the exploration
this caye; and although the antiquity of man has since been established on other
:unds, this work must be ever considered as inaugurating, and as forming the first
FFtematic attempt to solye, this important problem.
