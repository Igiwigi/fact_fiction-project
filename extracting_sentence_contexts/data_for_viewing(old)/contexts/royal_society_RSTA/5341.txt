atmospheric circulation over the past few decades, predominantly in late spring and summer. 3
This shift has been attributed to polar ozone depletion in the Antarctic lower stratosphere : a

cell all shift poleward. While similar changes, with the same sign, have been reproduced in [gf

models under GHG warming scenarios (e.g. [23,24]) they are also found in response to imposed
ozone depletion (e.g. [25-28]). In fact, on the basis of GCM studies in which both forcings were
included, separately and together, it is believed that ozone depletion has been the primary
cause of the observed wind changes [29,30]. In the future, assuming ozone depletion weakens
as expected, the effects of GHG and ozone forcings may no longer act in the same sense on

surface winds. : =

however, debate about the cause of the observed decadal trends in sea-ice extent, which show [4
