The degeneracy distributions that admit a non-power representation are extremely rare. In
order to see this, note that symmetry of the degeneracy table is a necessary condition for a
existence of a non-power representation. The ratio between the number of symmetric degeneracy
tables over the total number of possible tables gives a coarse assessment of this fact under the
assumption that every table occurs with the same probability. Counting the number of degeneracy tables is analogous to what in physics is called the Boseâ€”
Einstein statistics, that is, counting the ways one can distribute k indistinguishable balls into 1
labelled urns. In our 6-bit binary system, we have 64 strings/balls and 24 numbers/urns.
