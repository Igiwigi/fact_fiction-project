In the oceans IGWs power the overturning meridional
circulation that affects pollutant disposal, marine productivity and global climate [4]. Elsewhere
in the Solar System IGWs have been detected on Mars [5] and Jupiter [6,7]. In fact, the viscous
damping of IGWs on Jupiter could explain the enigmatic temperature structure of the planet's
thermosphere, addressing a long-standing problem in planetary physics [7]. In astrophysics,
IGWs, randomly excited in space and time by overshooting convection, have been invoked to
explain the uniform rotation of the solar core [8] and the rotation profile and the surface Lithium
abundance of solar-type stars [9]. IGWs have also been proposed as an agent for the mechanical
heating of stellar atmospheres and coronae [10].
