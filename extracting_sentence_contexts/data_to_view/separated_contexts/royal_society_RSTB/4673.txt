D), and this leads on to the condition seen in the
adult Mustelus (fig. 8, A, p. 354). The developmental history of the intermediale of the Carchariide as set out above
would no doubt have been more convincing if the successive stages had been worked
out in embryos, young and adults of one and the same species, but such a series was
not accessible. The facts as here elucidated are, however, in my opinion, such as will
stand the test should a large series of Mustelus, Galeus, Carcharias or eit at

some later time become available for investigation. VERTEBRAL CENTRA IN SHARKS AND RAYS. 331

Another series illustrating the development of the intermedial components of the
centrum is that shown in fig. 17, p. 865. Chaloscyllium was obtained in three stages
of development, namely, an embryo of a length of 120 mm., one of a length of
240 mm., and an adult.
