umbilicus is depressed, instead of being elevated into a tubercle; and the moniliform
tubercles along the septal bands are wanting.

143. The departures from this typical form, however, are very wide. A glance at
any considerable aggregation of specimens reveals to us an extraordinary variety of size
and shape; and our attention is Specially attracted by a series of which an example is
represented in Plate TIL. fig. 9, which are not merely distinguished by a 8ize greatly
above the average—their long diameter reaching nearly *4 inch, —but also by the
extraordinary flattening of the later convolutions, and the rapidity with which the
spire opens out. The approximation between the two lateral walls of the chambers is
here 80 close, that not only are the septal bands rendered yery prominent by the
depression of the outer surface between them, but even the outer marginal band stands
up as a ridge, from which the walls of the chambers slope down. In fact, an exami-
nation of this form leaves the observer impressed with surprise that any room can
be left for the animal, the 8egments of which must be extraordinarily attenuated, losing
in thickness what they gain in area. Now a careful comparison of this form with the
ordinary type, not only makes it obvious that the former differs from the latter in no

regularly arranged punctations,

other particular than this attenuation, which (as already pointed out in the cases of
Heterostegina and Peneroplis) is a common feature of the later growths in Foraminifera,
but also that the attenuation takes place in such different degrees in different individuals,
that any attempt to use it as a differential character is completely baffled by the con-
tinuous gradation of forms that is presented, between the one which has been assumed
