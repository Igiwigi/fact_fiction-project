show that there are states of voluntary muscle, in which the longitudinal filaments
(© fibrille”) take no part in producing the transverse striz ; these striz being caused
by the windings of spirals, within which very minute bundles of longitudinal filaments
are,contained and have their origin. The spirals are interlaced (fig. 64 «, 8, y). When
mature, they are flat and grooved filaments, having the compound structure above de-
scribed. With the shortening of the longitudinal filaments (<fibrillee”) in muscular
contraction, the surrounding spirals—and of course the striz—become elongated and
narrow: while in relaxation, these changes are reversed. The * convoluted fila-

elucidate sevyeral facts already known, but, as it appears to me, not satisfactorily ex-
plained. Thus, for instance, combined as I find these Spiral threads of muscle, and
Situated one within the other, there cannot well be much difference in their lengths,
when the fasciculus is broken off. Hence in part, probably, it is that the fasciculus
