tion of true smell, for it in all probability was more due to irritation of nerves of
common sensation.

The reaction, however, was decidedly diminished, and was not caused when the
vapour was held only before the nostrils.

The absence of reaction on the tongue points to impairment of the sensation of taste,
and perhaps the want of desire to eat may have its explanation in loss of this faculty.

The experiment, however, is not regarded as conclusive, and is to be taken in
connexion with other facts. It is brought out more clearly than before that the loss
of tactile sensation coincides with lesion of the hippocampus and hippocampal convo-

lution. This region was quite destroyed on the left side, and loss of tactile sensation
was observed on the opposite side; while on the leſt side tactile sensation apparently
