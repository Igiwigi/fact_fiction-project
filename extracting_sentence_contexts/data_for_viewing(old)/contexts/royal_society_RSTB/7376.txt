HISTORICAL REVIEW

Historical accounts of the study of corals up to the end of the previous century have been
given by Ogilvie (1897) and by Potta (1902), while among later works containing com-
prehensive reviews may be mentioned Grove (1934), Sanford (1939), Hill (1935)and Vaughan
& Wells (1943). The following is a brief sketch of the development of our knowledge con-
cerning the Rugosa since the middle of the previous century.

The study of the Rugosa has always been influenced by that of the Scleractinia; in fact,
no attempt at a historical treatment of one group could omit some account of the other.

176 H. GC. WANG ON REVISION OF ZOANTHARIA RUGOSA

In the classical work of Edwards & Haime (1848) it was assumed that the rules of septal
insertion were valid for both groups, although one is based on a tetrameral and the other
on a hexameral symmetry, but in 1869 Kunth discovered the law governing the septal
insertion peculiar to most Palaeozoic corals. This had great influence on the thought of the
time, and led to Haeckelâ€™s recognition in 1896 of Hexacoralla and Tetracoralla as the two
