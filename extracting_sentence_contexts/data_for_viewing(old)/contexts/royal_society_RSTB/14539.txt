led to enriched semantics found in the test with a positive
trend for all means of enrichment. Interestingly, we revealed
that semantic aspects co-constructed in the reading situation
are directly related to those addressed in the test, especially
when the semantic aspects were enriched by emotionalization
and perspectivation simultaneously. For expressing initial
understanding of mercy—a word that is emotionally valenced
and at the same time requires and involves perspectivation—
children used both linguistic strategies that they also experi-
enced during joint reading. Children who did not co-
construct during reading also did not use enrichments in the
test situation. The question of how this enrichment contributes
to the acquisition of the word remains unanswered. In fact, we
could not find any correlation between the co-construction in
reading and the test scores. We can only argue that the picture
test can be considered as a further learning situation in which
the child deepens their ability to distinguish the semantic

concept of mercy from closely related concepts to mark relevant
aspects. For such learning, the use of enrichment appears to be
meaningful.

Overall, our pilot study reveals that emotionalization and
perspectivation—leading to successful semantic enrichment of
abstract words [20,28,38-40]—are also applied in both children
