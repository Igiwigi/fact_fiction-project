Zonnexion of the olivary bodies with the hypoglossal nuclei is yery striking. I have
aalso shown that a column of cells connected with longitudinal fibres and continuous with
She fasciculus teres, whence the facial nerve takes its origin, descends low down into the
Snedulla and lies at the back of the hypoglossal nucleus (se K', fig. 25, Plate X., and
figs. 38, 39 & 40, Plate XI.). Moreover, a band of fibres descending from the loop of
Sthe facial nerve (1", fig. 57, Plate XIV.) passes downwards beneath the hypoglossal
Enucleus (J). The close commissural connexion between the hypoglossal nucleus (J', fig.

31, Plate X.) and the vagal nucleus (IH, 1') has been already pointed out. And lastly,
®we have scen that the lower end of the column of cells constituting the nucleus of the
Smotor root of the trigeminus is imbedded in the columns which ascend from the olivary
Sbody. But whether the olivary bodies really act through the channels jus: mentioned,
Sand thus coordinate the moyements of articulation, is not proved by the anatomical facts
alone. On the other hand, amongst birds, in which scarcely any traces of olivary bodies
are to be found, the Parrot-tribe have the power of distinctly articulating particular
words; while in the Porpoise, which emits only a kind of moaning sound, the olivary bodies
are enormously developed*. Experiment throws no light whatever on this subject, 80

* T obtained, through the kindness of Mr, W. H. Frowsn, of the College of Surgeons, part of the medulla of
= Porpoise,” and found that the large olivary bodies overlaying the pyramids were everywhere crowded with
*  nerve-cells. The cerebrum of the Porpoise is large and globular, and the convolutions are very numerous and
| deep. The only remarkable points in the actions of the animal, are its great agility and vivacity of movement,
* and its extraordinary speed and muscular power.
