located at random, obviously the same identical set of N” values of the statistic will be
obtained, that is, up{R(%)} = usR(mM)}, which was obtained in the case of the sth micro-
state. Here, as already explained, R(m) would mean ny basic cells taken at random, and
u{R(p)} would mean a statistic formed from the corresponding 1 values; and obviously
the suffix p or s may be dropped. It should be noted that once the m) values are given—no
matter whether they come from a random sample or grid—u{R(np)} or u,{Gr(m)} are the
same functionally and numerically; R(t) and Gr(n)) denote how the n values have come.

In fact, in unrestricted sampling all micro-states would yield the same identical distribution ~

of the statistic u{R(np)}, where ¢ goes from 1 to N”. It is obvious that this is also the same
distribution as that which is obtained from the abstract distribution of z. Thus the important
and practically axiomatic result is reached that in unrestricted sampling the distribution
of any sample statistic based on samples of size no is identical for all micro-states and also
for the abstract distribution. In other words, in unrestricted sampling it is not possible to
distinguish between different micro-states or between any micro-state and the corresponding
abstract set of z. In this situation the theory of sampling distribution for the abstract dis-
tribution is sufficient for all purposes.

63. Now consider configurational sampling. Here there are N separate bundles each
consisting of N’ values; and each such set of N’ values belong to a particular micro-state.
