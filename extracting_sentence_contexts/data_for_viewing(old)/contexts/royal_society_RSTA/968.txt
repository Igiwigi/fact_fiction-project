systems, one can evaluate the amplitude of the Fourier mode after some time. From the auto-
correlation function of a Fourier mode, averaging over starting time f, for a fixed time lag ty — to,

where the star denotes the complex conjugate. We will use the fact that the quenched disorder iw
is uncorrelated above a size |-, to approximate its Fourier transform along the front as the one :
obtained for a straight line travelling at speed v in this landscape: :3

Along such straight fronts at positions (x’, ag + vt’) and (x", ag + ot”), the values of G,(x’, ’) = : 8
G¢(x', a9 + vt’) and G,(x", ”) = G,(x", ap + vt”) correspond to a white noise of square amplitude :

range of the quenched disorder), and time lags such that Jt’ — t”| </:. Hence, expressing this
condition with a Heaviside function © as @(I, — o|t’ — t”|), the resulting time integration kernel
