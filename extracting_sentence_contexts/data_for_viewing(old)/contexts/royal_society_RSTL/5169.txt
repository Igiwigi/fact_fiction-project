S According to my opinion (see my little work on the Slow and Rapid Combustion
=> of Bodies) there does not exist a compound of nitrogen =NO,, I consider what
chemists call the first hydrate of nitric acid as NO, + HO,, and the normal nitrates
2 as NO,+RO,. Nitrate of lime is therefore to me NO,+CaOz. Agreeable to that
Ss view, Iam inclined to account for the nitrification above mentioned in the following
& manner. Ozone transforms first CaO into CaO,, a change which, according to my
© recent experiments, a number of basic oxides undergo within an ozonized atmo-
= &phere. The oxides of manganese, lead, cobalt, nickel, and silyer, for instance, are
= readily transformed by ozone into their corresponding peroxides. Whilst peroxide
S of calcium is formed, ozone exerts an oxidizing influence also upon the nitrogen con-
% tained in atmospheric air, and forms NO,, which uniting to CaO,, produces what we
© call nitrate of lime.
bF The fact, that electrical sparks passing through a moist mixture of oxygen and
S nitrogen generate nitric acid, was first ascertained by Cavznpisn, 1785 ; in 1840 1
& made the observation that under the same circumstances ozone is- produced. Davy
= has found that traces of nitric acid are formed around the positive electrode if a
Z current passes through water containing atmospheric air or nitrogen, and I have
L agcertained that under the same circumstances ozone is generated.
5 From the facts above stated, it appears that during the slow combustion which
A phosphorus undergoes in moist atmospheric air nitric acid is formed, and we are now
well aware that ozone makes its appearance at the same time. The invariable con-
comitance of the two phenomena mentioned, 4. e. the contemporary formation of nitric
acid and ozone which takes place under circumstances apparently so very different
from each other, gives room to suspect that the production of one of those compounds
is in some way or other connected with the generation of the other.
