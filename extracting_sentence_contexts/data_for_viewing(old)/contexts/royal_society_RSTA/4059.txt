et al. [13] demonstrated a near-room-temperature magnetic refrigerator reliably producing cooling
powers exceeding 500 W using elemental Gd while employing a 5T driving field. These two
developments opened a new chapter in magnetocaloric cooling, taking the first steps towards the
projected transformation of a laboratory curiosity into a line of commercial cooling devices using
the magnetocaloric effect [14].

Similar to magnetocaloric cooling, the feasibility of exploiting the electrocaloric effect has
been demonstrated first at cryogenic temperatures by Radebaugh eft al. [15,16], and later near
room temperature in several laboratory-scale devices by Sinyavsky & Brodyansky [17], Jia &
Ju [18], Gu et al. [19,20] and Wang et al. [21]. Finally, elastocaloric cooling is getting some serious
attention after Cui et al. [22,23] demonstrated a cooling device based on the principle suggested
by Annaorazov et al. [24]. Despite a number of successful demonstrations, all three near-room-
temperature caloric cooling technologies remain in their infancy, mostly due to the facts that (i)
the caloric effects that can be produced in readily available driving fields without damaging a
material are relatively weak, (ii) active regeneration is required to achieve the temperature span
of a typical vapour-compression device and (iii) caloric materialâ€”caloric cooling/heat pumping
device integration is, therefore, far from trivial.

Over the last 20 or so years various aspects of caloric materials and caloric refrigeration/heat
pumping devices have been reviewed in a number of publications [25-41] and a few books [42,43].
Readers interested in details and the then-current state of the art are referred to all of these quality
publications. As suggested by the title of this work, here we restrict ourselves to discussing
materials-related issues that may lead to stronger caloric effects generated by driving fields that
are easily produced and maintained, with the goal to support accelerated development of better
caloric materials and, therefore, broad adoption of these solid-state caloric cooling technologies
