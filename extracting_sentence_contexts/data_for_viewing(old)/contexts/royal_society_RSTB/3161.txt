filled with closely packed oogonia. Prior to the seasonal maturity these oogonia are
found in active mitosis, and this proliferation, together with the subsequent growth
of the resulting oocytes, speedily produces the enlarged ovarial terminations of the
genital rachis of the mature individual.t

In the maturing ovary the growing oocytes form a more or less solid mass of cells,
between which oogonia are still present in considerable numbers. The only constant
feature in the arrangement of the germ-cells consists, as HAMANN pointed out, in the
invariably peripheral position of the still growing oocyte. As there is no germinal
epithelium, the new generations of oocytes being derived from the scattered oogonia,
there must either be an active peripheral migration of the oocyte prior to the
commencement of its growth, or else only those oocytes which happen to already
possess this position ever commence the latter process. The fact that this position

T Hamann, 1889 (‘Jen. Zeitsch. f. Naturwiss.,’ vol. 23, p. 344), could not determine the connection of
this sinus with those in the calyx, though its vascular nature in other echinoderms is undoubted.

Lupwie, 1877, describing a germinal epithelium and follicular arrangement of the germ-cells similar to
that oecurring in Holothurians.
