Aconine cannot be classed as a
Pisonous alkaloid, very large doses being necessary to produce death even in frogs. 2The results of this enquiry, which has occupied the authors for the greater part of
fur years, bring out in a most striking manner the almost complete dependence of
@e extraordinary toxic power and pharmacological action of the aconitine molecule

the presence of the radical (acetyl) of acetic acid, whilst in a lesser degree the
tion of benzaconine is seen to depend on the existence in the molecule of this
@kalvid of the radical (benzoyl) of benzoic acid. The inertness of the alkaloid,
Bonine, denuded of both the acetyl and benzoyl groups of aconitine, seems to the
@uthors to be one of the most interesting facts in chemical pharmacology. From

e practical point of view the authors regard the demonstration of the antagonisin
@ aconine and benzaconine towards aconitine as an important result of this investi-

tion, which, taken as a whole, it is believed, will throw into clearer light the mode
of action of the alkaloids of Aconitum napellus. &
