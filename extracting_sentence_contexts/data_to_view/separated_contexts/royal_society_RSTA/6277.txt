Yet an improved representation of these processes does not necessarily lead to a convergence. Indeed, there are other climate parameters whose range have increased from CMIP5 to CMIP6
such as climate sensitivity (the temperature response of the climate system to increases in CO
concentrations) [38]. Another possibility is that these differences stem from the fact that different
models were considered for the CMIP5 and CMIP6 project, i.e. we did not limit ourselves to only
consider those models that participated (and whose data were available to us) in both CMP5 and
CMIP6. In a study by Gong ef al. [39], this was done, i.e. they compared the AMOC in 18 models
that exist in both CMIP5 and CMIP6 (albeit with different model versions including changes in the
resolution). But they also found a large spread in long-term AMOC trends in the CMIP6 models,
and a greater deviation of the CMIP6 models (compared to the CMIP5 models) from the mean of
the RAPID observations, supporting our findings.
