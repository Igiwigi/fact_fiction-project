OF FOSSIL PLANTS FROM THE PALAJOZOIC ROCKS. 321

A much more real difference from any known seed is the peculiar shape of the
micropyle, forming a long narrow slit, extending the whole length of the seed, instead
of a more or less tubular canal. This is a striking difference, but is no doubt
correlated with the form of the sporangium. An ordinary sporangium or nucellus
usually begins as a rounded papilla ; the integument as it grows up around it leaves
a tubular opening at the top; but in the Lepidodendrex, where the sporangium is
elongated in the radial direction, it is intelligible that when it became integumented,
its envelope should have had a correspondingly elongated opening. The fact that in
Lepidocarpon the whole sporophyll, or at least the greater part of it, takes part in
the formation of the seed-like organ is again a marked difference from the typical
seeds of the higher plants. This fact is connected with the foliar origin of the
integument, which necessitates the participation of the sporophyll in order to complete
the inclosure of the sporangium. From the point of view of formal morphology we
might hence be led to speak of the seed-like organ as a “ fruit” ; it seems more
profitable, however, to regard the participation of the sporophyll as a probable
characteristic of a very primitive type of seed.

A seed, however, according to current definitions, should contain an embryo; that
is to say, in typical seeds, the fertilised ovum develops to a certain, very variable
extent, while still inclosed in the seed-coats. This criterion is of very little practical
value; no satisfactory indication of an embryo has yet been found in Lepidocarpon,
but this applies equally to the fossil Gymnospermous seeds, in none of which (until
we come to the Mesozoic Bennettites) has an embryo ever been observed, although
