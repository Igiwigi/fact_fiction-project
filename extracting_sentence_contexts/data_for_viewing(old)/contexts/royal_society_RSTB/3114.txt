agree with him.

The case of the pinks cited by Prim.ieux is peculiar because the disease
appeared in plants in the open, towards the end of summer, in August and
September. The author gives no figures and does not say whether the disease
appeared in wet or dry weather, though he notes that the plants had been freely
watered.

When formed experimentally, intumescences are never developed rapidly on older
leaves, but only quite slowly, nor are they so large as those on younger leaves, even
under the same external conditions.

These facts are evidence in favour of the view, which is confirmed by most of the
experiments made, that the leaf must be actively assimilating and in an irritable
condition. Even in a young leaf, if the external conditions are changed gradually,
the response is gradual; on the other hand sudden changes call forth an immediate
response.

In some cases if the conditions are changed very slowly the plant is able to
accommodate itself to them without any formation of intumescences, Ã©.e., without
any considerable change in metabolism.

(2) Again, the presence or absence of light in the formation of intumescences is,
doubtless, connected with assimilation. Some plants, eg., Hibiscus, do not form
intumescences in darkness, while others, e.g., Populus tremula, do so with some
