I united the two liquors; and a precipitate, exactly resembling
that which is formed by green sulphate of iron in palladium,
was instantly formed. I collected the precipitate, and exposed
it to a strong heat; and, after repeated trials, obtained a metallic
button, not to be distinguished from palladium. It certainly is one of the most extraordinary facts respecting
alloys, that two metals, by their union with each other, should
s0 lose the characteristic properties of each individually, that
neither of them can be immediately detected by the usual
methods. Nothing but an affinity of the most powerful order
could produce such effects. But, to place the metals under the


of a metallic Substance called Palladium.
