Moreover, it appears that the h against r relation obtained experimentally is determined, ; |
in the case of a small degree of non-parallelism of the cup bases, by the mean separation of
these bases. Experiments illustrating this fact are described in §12.

In making normal stress measurements on liquids of high viscosity, it was not found _ |
possible to adjust the cup bases to a sufficiently high degree of parallelism to eliminate com-
pletely the effects described above. This may be readily appreciated from the magnitude
of the effects shown in figure 5. Accordingly, in carrying out normal stress measurements,
these effects were minimized as far as possible by adjusting the parallelism of the cup bases
and were then further corrected by measuring the values of h for clockwise and counter-
clockwise directions of rotation and finding their means.
