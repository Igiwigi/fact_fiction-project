being the velocity initially given to the second oscillator, with the first oscillator initially at rest
and all three springs initially relaxed. Then, in normalized form one would have: Ey = mV /kyd?.
As the averaging cannot change the energy, her(0,0) = Eo would hold. Therefore, one obtains

It is noteworthy that the perfectly localized impulsive ICs naturally feasible for the full system
are not in fact represented in the averaged system (the reason is basically that the squared sine has
a non-zero average on a period). This fact poses no problem for the identification of the LPT for
many systems, among others the case studied in [49], because the non-zero addition to the energy
augmenting the localized-impulsive one is independent of the averaged-system’s state variables.
Here, however, the fact that localized impulsive ICs are not represented in the averaged system
does raise a question on correct identification of the LPT. The answer to this question is suggested
in equation (5.9).

(b) Identification of the saddle point and derivation of the critical coupling

One observes from equation (3.21) that there is a fixed point in the averaged Hamiltonian
corresponding to % =z. Moreover, the averaged Hamiltonian is clearly symmetric with respect
to a switch between the oscillators, and thus a line in the middle of the range representing the
distribution of energy between the oscillators is a symmetry plane, and this line corresponds to
y =1/2, which is thus where the associated derivative of the Hamiltonian vanishes. Therefore,
a fixed point of the system, specified by 0h/00 = dh/dy =0, can be found at the point (y=
1/2,0,.=1).
