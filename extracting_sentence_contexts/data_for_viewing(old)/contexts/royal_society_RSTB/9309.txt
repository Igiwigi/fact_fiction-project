concrete evidence that the newest phase is dawning in
the nanotechnology eraâ€”the so-called fourth generation has
arrived, illustrated by state-of-the-art examples, including self-
assembly and bioelectronics for medicines as discussed below.
As predicted by the Royal Society over a decade before [1],
the nanotechnology revolution offers new biomaterials, and
better understanding and manipulation of bio-nano inter-
actions of materials and cellular activity at the nanoscale, with
fascinating opportunities for business and human health. An
added-value from study of nanotechnologies and nanomater-
ials is that these tiny materials allow scientists to probe
cellular and tissue functioning and spotlight gaps in human
knowledge. Indeed, several speakers highlighted the fact that
getting very new ideas to a level of robust maturity in an emer-
gent field can take years, especially when new knowledge and
untested know-how challenge established norms in the medical
field. For example, the validity of in vitro models and
approaches, which have traditionally used 10% calf serum
protein to sustain cell cultures, was questioned, because the

introduction of nanomaterials results in binding of these pro-
teins to the nanoparticle surfaces with the potential for
presentation of a non-native biological identity due to unfolding
of the proteins at the nanoparticle surface. Across the wide
range of topics discussed, the key underpinning concept
