We do not consider that the numbers arrived at for the molecular velocities can
lay claim to great accuracy, owing to the irregularities in the results, some of which
have not quite been traced yet. But we think that we are able to say generally
that metals of light atomic weight, like aluminium and magnesium, are projected from
the poles with greater velocities than the heavier ones we have tried, such as zinc,
cadmium and mereury. Different curvatures of different lines are marked in the case
of bismuth, and are not easily explained, except by assuming the presence of different
kinds of molecules having different masses, the lighter ones diffusing more quickly.
We have thus established a method which is likely to prove of extreme value in
separating the effects of different molecules.

Our experiments also allow us to draw another important conclusion, When two
lines of a metal are of unequal intensity, it is not always due to the fact that at
any period of the discharge the vibrations which appear the strongest are really the
most intense. Our eye or the photographic film only perceives the total energy sent
out, and the time of luminosity is in many cases very different for different lines.
A vibration which is weak but persists may appear stronger than one of greater
intensity which only appears for a very short time.

We have been led in addition to a new method of taking spark spectra with an
induction coil, by the discovery that self-induction in the spark circuit leads to the
disappearance of the air lines, which are often very troublesome in the investigation
of spark spectra.

Finally, the appearance of the calcium lines in the photograph of the silver spectrum
