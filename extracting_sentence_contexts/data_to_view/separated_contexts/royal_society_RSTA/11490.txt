The second reading at 7°41 atoms was taken on the day after the first. Until
16°67 atomic per cents. of silver no higher point than the eutectic could be found
although the alloys were heated above 500° C., and the cooling carefully watched |
until the eutectic point was reached. This must be due to the fact that very little
solid separates out at the F.P. With more than this proportion of silver the F.C.
could be detected, but the indication was slight until 23 atomic per cents. of silver. The eutectic point deduced from the above is 303°3°; in our previous work
