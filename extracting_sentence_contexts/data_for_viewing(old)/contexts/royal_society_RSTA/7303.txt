scale as in figures 14 and 15.

The results of the two series of experiments are summarized in tables 3 and 4. The film
used for the sequence of oxygen dosages is common to both tables; it is denoted by number 8
in table 8, and by number 0 in table 4. All the results for ¢; refer to the standard intensity
of illumination of 0-05 W/cm.?. The slopes are tabulated as the negatives of the gradients
of log, ¢ against (kT)~! at the temperatures — 190 and 290° C, so that they may be compared
directly with the conventional thermal activation energies of other semi-conductors. The
final column in each table contains approximate values of the thermoelectric power of
the films; however, these numbers are only given to one significant figure, as the apparatus
was not designed to measure thermoelectric effects accurately.

A number of interesting facts emerge from a consideration of the results. The conductivity-
