For what purpose are the vital organs
thus connected with every part of the brain and spinal marrow ? This question is answered by experiments detailed in my treatise on the Vital
Functions, an account of some of which appeared in the Philosophical Trans-
actions of 1822. From them it was found that the power of secreting surfaces
is deranged by abstracting from them any considerable part of the influence
either of the brain or spinal marrow ; and as the function of secretion is effected
by the action of the nerves on the blood, as appears from facts detailed'in the
paper just referred to, and another which I had the honour to lay before the
Society a few weeks ago, it is evident that the presence- of neryous power in
a secreting organ would be useless, were not the blood on which it operates
also 8upplied, -and disordered if it were not supplied in due proportion ; and
consequently its supply varied as the supply of nervous power varies. We thus see not only why secreting surfaces are placed under the influence
of every part of the nervous system, but also why it is necessary that the san-
guiferous system should be under the controul of the same laws which regulate
the supply of neryous power. It appears then that by means of the system of ganglionic nerves, the in-
fluence of eyery part of the brain and spinal marrow is bestowed on secreting
surfaces, and on those organs by which the supply of their fluids is regulated,
and that this influence is necessary to their functions.
