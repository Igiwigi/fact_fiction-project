Take, for instance, the glasses A and B (Table II.). Comparison of the gold
content j with the size of the observed particles shows that those particles at any
rate are so far apart as not to satisfy our condition. The fact that glass A is
colourless shows that if there are also minute spheres present which escaped
observation, they also lie so far apart as not to be many to a wave-length. On the
other hand the pink colour of glass B suggests the presence of minute unobserved
spheres which are sufficiently close together to satisfy our condition, the absorption
of the glass being proportional to that small part of the gold content (4) which is
associated with the minute spheres. In both glasses the large particles reflect much more light than is emitted by the
minute spheres.
