Q © Having reason to think that the defects in question were mainly due to irregularity in the ordinary
Qontact-breaker, T constructed one with a steel rod as vibrator, having a small independent electro-magnet
or maintaining its action. The natural vibrations of the rods which were tried varied from 320 to 768 per
Sieetm, while under the action of the battery-current and electro-magnet they varied from 700 to 2500, or
ereabouts, per 8econd. The amplitudes of the vibrations were exceedingly xmall, in fact not exceeding
S01 of an inch; and i is to this fact, coupled with the extreme rapidity and consequent decision of make
Sand break, that T mainly attribute the steadiness of the results.
S * With a contact-breaker of this kind in good action several phenomena were noticeable ; but first and
.Foremost was the fact that, in a large number of tubes (especially hydrocarbons) the striw, instead of
ing sharp and flaky in form, irregular in distribution, and fluttering in position, were 8oft and rounded
Jn outline, equidistant in their intervals, and steady in proportion to the regularity of the contact-breaker.
hese results arc, T think, attributable more to the regularity than to the rapidity of the vibrations. And
.Uhis view is supported by the fact that, althongh the contact-breaker may change its note (as occasionally
happens), and in £0 doing may canse a temporary disturbance in the stratification, yeb the new note may
"produce as steady a et of striw as the first: and not only 80, but frequently there is heard, simultaneonsly

Heng made ; and yet, when the strident ound is regular, the strim are steady. On the other hand, to any

Aden alteration in the action of the brake (generally implied by an alteration in the sonnd) there always
<ecorresponds an alteration in the striw.

« Tt is difficult to describe the extreme delicacy in action of this kind of contact-breaker, or * high break,”
he ib may be called. The turning through 2% or 3” of a screw, whose complete revolution raises or lowers

A similar turn in a crew forming one foot of the pedestal of the brake is enongh to adjust or regulate tho
