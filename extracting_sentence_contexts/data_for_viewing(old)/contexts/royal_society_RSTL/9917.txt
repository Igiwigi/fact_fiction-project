from sufficient to account for the otherwise unrecovered amount of supplied nitrogen ;
and, judging from somewhat parallel cases, it would be concluded that at any rate
some would be retained by the 80il and s8nbsoil in an only slowly available condition,
but that a considerable proportion of the snpplied ammonia would be oxidated, and
pass away in the drainage, as nitrites and nitrates, beyond the reach of the roots.

It would thus appear probable that after the 13 years' application of ammonia-salts
to plot 6, 8ome at any rate of the supplied nitrogen remained within the 80il, and that
some of this was available to the growing plants during the 8ucceeding seven years.
But that as much was taken up as where the ammonia-salts were still annually
applied would seem to require some further explanation.

In reference to this point we have the significant fact, as will be fully illustrated
further on, that the surface s0il of plot 6 showed at the end of the 20 years—thab is,
after the mineral manures had been applied for seven years—a notably lower per-
centage of nitrogen than the corresponding layer of plot 5 ; thus pointing to a source
of nitrogen to the plants similar to that which is s8upposed to have contributed to the
high nitrogenous yield of plot 7, where the mineral manures alone, including potass,
had been applied throughout the 20 years. It remains to consider whether, not only
the conditions of manuring, but the characters of the vegetation, were also consistent
with, in great measure, a similar 8ource of nitrogen in the two cases.
