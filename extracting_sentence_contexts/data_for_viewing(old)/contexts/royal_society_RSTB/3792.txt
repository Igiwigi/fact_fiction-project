also to the differences in width, of the chromosomes.
In the archesporial divisions four of the chromo-
somes are decidedly smaller than the others, and the
remaining 12 show considerable variation (fig. 30).
Mistuer (1912) has clearly demonstrated this in-
equality in size in Galtona (Taf. 1, figs. 35, 36
