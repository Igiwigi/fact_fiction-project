stages of these. Perhaps this result is due to one or both of the simple vertical processes

274 MISS I. GORDON ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF

3. The Spheridium.—tThe fact that each ambulacrum bears, at metamorphosis, a
single spheridium has been overlooked by MacBrrpr (1903) in the case of E. miliaris,
although he was aware of their presence in Echinocardium cordatum. Tuten (1892)
found five spheeridia of a somewhat different type in the imago of Echinocyamus and
described their development. Usiscx (1913), on the other hand, figures no spheeridia
in the imago of Strongylocentrotus lividus.

A developing spheridium looks almost exactly like a miniature inter-ambulacral spine.
The basal portion, however, is very irregular in striking contrast to the great regularity
exhibited by that of the spine. (Fig. 10, a-e, compare with fig. 5.) Asa rule only four
