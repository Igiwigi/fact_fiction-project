with all five metal ions). Additionally, despite the differences in binding mode, we observe that
after 40 ns of MD simulation, the ester groups of both substrates overlay almost perfectly on the

6-metal. This has also been suggested for other organophosphatases, such as serum paraoxonase : =
1 (PON1), in the case of which the P(C)=O bonds of the chemically distinct phosphotriester and : =
lactone substrates are activated by the catalytic Ca*+ ion in the same way [6]. Similarly, even a
though different residues are involved in substrate positioning and transition state stabilization aed
for the two reactions, nevertheless, both interact with the metal ions in the MPH active site, which : _
clearly plays an important role in the activation of the ester bond for hydrolysis. : re

Following from this, there has been substantial debate as to whether ester hydrolysis is a DNS
concerted process or a stepwise process involving a tetrahedral intermediate [48]. Based on : =
computational studies of related reactions [49,50], and considering also the fact that p-nitrophenyl : ea

butyrate has a good leaving group, we have modelled the hydrolysis reaction as a single step
concerted process as shown in figure 2, based on the valence bond states shown in electronic
supplementary material figure S1. The resulting experimental and calculated energetics are
shown in figure 3 and electronic supplementary material table S2. As can be seen from this
table, we are able to both quantitatively and qualitatively reproduce the absolute and relative
activation barriers for the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl butyrate in the presence of Zn*+, Co**+,
Fe2+ and Mn?+ in the MPH active site. In the case of Ni2+, we underestimate the activation
barrier compared to experimental data, although this was also the case in paraoxon hydrolysis
and may be due to uncertainties in the experimental solvation-free energies that this metal ion
has been parameterized to (see detailed discussion of this issue in [26,51,52]).
