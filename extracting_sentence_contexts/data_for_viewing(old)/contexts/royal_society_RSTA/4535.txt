providing explicit information about the likelihood of false alarms can increase trust and elicit
better decision-making relative to formats that simply provide recommendations for action [9].
Hence, when creating decision aids incorporating information from climate forecasts, providers
must test their materials to ensure that the existence of uncertainty is not obscured [18].
In terms of current usersâ€™ perceptions of understandability and usefulness, our results show
that there is a mismatch between the perceived usefulness of seasonal and interannual forecasts,
and how easy to understand current users find them; with seasonal and interannual forecasts
being perceived as more useful than they are understandable. We also find that seasonal
and interannual forecasts are considered to be less understandable than weather forecasts.
This may of course be explained by the greater familiarity of weather forecasts. Research
examining information preferences for hurricane path forecasts [36] and long-term climate change
projections [35] has found a tendency for people to prefer familiar formats to novel ones.
Likewise, the fact that many weather forecasts are deterministic rather than probabilistic may
render them easier to interpret. It is also possible that thinking about the next few days to
weeks is easier than the next few months to years. Nonetheless, the disparity in perceived
understandability between weather forecasts and seasonal and interannual forecasts suggests that
the user-friendliness of forecasts tends to diminish with increasing forecast lead time. It should be
kept in mind that participants rated only those forecasts that their organization currently received.
We may therefore infer that those who responded to questions about seasonal and interannual



forecasts were already motivated to engage with this information. Hence, the low ratings of 8 |
understandability by this group suggest that perceived difficulty could be a considerable barrier
