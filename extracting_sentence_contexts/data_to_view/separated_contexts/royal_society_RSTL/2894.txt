Thus the common Cabbage Butterflies, Papilio brassice, Lixx., and P. Napi, Laxx.,
when changed from larva to pupz in the middle of summer, become perfect insects
within a fortnight; but when the change into the pupa state takes place at the end
of summer, the perfect insects are not developed until the following Spring, unless,
as shown long ago by Reaunus, they are placed in a warm atmosphere, when they
may at any time be deyeloped within @ few days, eyen in the months of December
and January. Besides these facts, and a variety of others which are equally well
known, eyery one is aware that the hybernation of many insects occurs at compara-
tively high degrees of temperature. The facts connected with the presumed plethoric
condition of insects before hybernating are equally referable to those perfect insects
which pass the winter months in hybernacula as to larye which are about to pass
into the pupa tate, since it is found that they always have a much larger accumula-
tion of fat in the autumn than at other scasons of the year. This is the case in the
