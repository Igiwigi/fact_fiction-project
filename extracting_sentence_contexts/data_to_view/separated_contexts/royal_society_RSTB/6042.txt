504 KE. TREWAVAS ON THE HYOID AND LARYNX OF THE ANURA. The hyoid and larynx of this specimen have been sectioned and the following facts
are revealed :â€”The ventral cushion of the hyoid plate, between the postero-medial
processes, consists of hyaline cartilage, with more matrix between the cells than in other
parts of hyoid and larynx. The extrahyals, on the other hand, consist of cartilage
with small elements and little matrix. The aryteenoids are not fenestrated.
