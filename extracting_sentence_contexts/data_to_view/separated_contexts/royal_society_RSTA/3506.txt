The experimental difference observed can thus be attributed to misfit dislocations. TEM in situ measurements in the same kind of sample confirm this hypothesis (figure 2). In fact, misfit dislocations were observed at the y-ZrH/Zr interface at 300K before heating
(figure 2b). In the same figure, the depinning of a misfit dislocation is observed at 700K when
the dissolution is completed. This means that part of the hydrogen atoms from the dissolved
precipitate are driven away from the precipitation region and are no more available to re-
precipitate [86].
