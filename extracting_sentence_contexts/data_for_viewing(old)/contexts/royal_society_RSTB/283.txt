tion in plants, so the relations we may be able to establish between obsery:
phenomena in plants may guide us to the better understanding of correspondi
relations in animals. As was shown in the introduction, the question in ani
physiology at present lies between those who regard the action of a stimulus as
mere interference with a previously existing state of electrical activity, and those w
think that the electrical concomitant of excitatory reaction has no necessary conn
tion with any such state. According to the former view, it is held that when
muscle is excited the excitatory variation comes into existence d’emblée ; according
the latter, the constant operation of one or more such forces is presupposed, as well
their liability to be disturbed by external influences. In the leaf, observed facts sho
most conclusively that the two sets of phenomena—those of the excited and those
the unexcited state—are linked together by indissoluble bands ; that every change in
the state of the leaf when at rest conditionates a corresponding change in the way i
which it responds to stimulation, the correspondence consisting in this, that the sign,
that is the direction, of the response is opposed to that of the previous state, so that.
as the latter changes sign in the direction from | to | the former changes from | to }.

This remarkable relation, the discovery and experimental demonstration of which
has been the most important fruit of my more recent work, can only be understood to
mean that the constantly operative electromotive forces which find their expression in
the persistent difference of potential between the opposite surfaces, and those more
transitory ones which are called into existence by stimulation, have the same seat—
