(In illustration
emark that for a unicursal curve, the position of @ answers to a value =, and that of
to a value =þ of the parameter 0, viz. a, w are the two values of 0 at the double
point; contrariwise in the foregoing case of a cusp, where there is a single value A={p. Hence the whole number of the united points («, B) is =:;+z, and this is in fact the
value given (as will presently appear) by the theory of correspondence. I recall that I use A, =2D, to denote twice the deficiency of the curve, viz. that we
have A=X —22+2+z, =—24—2X+2+E.
