According to our experience it is necessary to proceed very circumspectly in the
‘Binterpretation of graphic records from the Mammalian heart, and, so far as we know,
“athe best, and indeed the only way, to avoid falling into error is to take care to control
&the observations made with one method by means of experiments in which some

gother method has been used. S| SECTION II.—METHODS. & We have constantly, in the course of our work, been reminded that the graphic
Smethods which may be used for studying the heart’s action may very easily lead to

erroneous conclusions unless it be known what are the sources of error inherent in
Gany particular method employed, and also, unless it be kept clearly in mind what
kind of facts the employment of any given method is capable of supplying, and what
kind of facts it is unfitted to elucidate. In the observations which are recorded in
the following pages, we have made use mainly of two forms of cardiograph, one of them,
the cardiometer, being arranged to record the changes in volume. which the heart
undergoes ; the other, the myocardiograph, giving graphic records of the contractions
of any part or parts of the wall of the heart in the same way as an ordinary myograph
records the contractions of a voluntary muscle.
