SPENCER has, in his * Principles of Biology,‚Äù placed a gulf between Planarians and
Leeches by denoting the former as secondary, the latter as tertiary aggregates*, It is
obvious, however, that a single leech is directly comparable to a single Bipalium. The

would surely come out in their development, or at least some indication of the mode of
their genesis would survive in the development of some Annelid. Such, however, is not
the case. The young worm or leech is at first unsegmented, like a Planarian ; and the
traces of segmentation appear subsequently in it, just as do the protovertebre in verte-
brates, which Mr.
