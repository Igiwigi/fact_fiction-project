of liquid could be introduced at any time. It happened on one occasion that an
H-cell to which a large excess of alt had been added, was 80 far crusted up
next the metallic surfaces that it began to show signs of failing E.M.F., much as
if ib were going dry. The mass was 80 compact that no impression could be
made upon it with a glass rod ; but it was bored through with a steel reamer,
when the E.M.F. at once recovered its normal value. In such cases the acces
8ibility is advantageous, especially for purposes of experiment. Tt is well, however,
to avoid such a large excess of salt as was present in this case, By alternate
melting and crystallisation as the temperature rises and falls, there is a tendency :
to aggregation, of which the cell above referred to affords an extreme example.

In the construction of cells with solid zinc electrodes, I have fallen back upoy
a simplified patternâ€”nothing more in fact than a small tube with a platinum
wire sealed through its closed end. See figure. :

The only objection to this form is that the cells cannot, without precaution, be
rted from underneath, Most of mine are held at the centre by a spring (cut
sheet metal) against a piece of board mounted on its edge. In this case the
per electrodes are secured in sealing-wax to the wooden stand. For eingle cells,
hen portability is desired and convenience of immersion in water or ice, ib is a good
