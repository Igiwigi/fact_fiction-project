conditions. Christian (1950), in a most important paper, has reviewed the evidence that
symptoms found in certain natural populations are typical of disorders of this mechanism
and has already concluded that they are responsible for periodic decrease in certain
mammals. It has been known for some years that voles in captivity will fight to the death
under some circumstances (Ranson 1934). More recently this aggressive behaviour has
been studied at this Bureau by Mr J. R. Clarke, who has found certain’ morphological
changes typical of a stressed condition. So far, however, there is no experimental evidence
that the young of stressed females have a reduced longevity or fertility.

(b) Synchrony

If all properties of a fluctuation in numbers were accounted for by an intraspecific
process, separate populations would fluctuate independently. In fact, there is a strong
tendency for similar states of abundance to occur over larger areas than seems likely by
pure chance. Exceptions are important in showing that no regular climatic cycle can be
directly responsible for the mortality; but the tendency for separate units to be in phase
must be due to some co-ordinating process.

It has been shown that some form of intraspecific strife seems to be the process control-
ling population density. We may reasonably suppose that the action of the factors capable
of producing this control is ‘governed by the density of the population controlled’
(Nicholson 1933) or is ‘density-dependent’ (Smith 1935). Crombie (1944) has shown that
the frequency of chance encounters between individuals has this property and that the
resulting mortality rate in larvae of Sitotroga cerealella and Rhizopertha dominica increases
in linear relationship to density. He has termed the process ‘competition for space’,
