As the above Proposition is of great importance in the solution of differential

equations, we $hall devote some attention to the cireumstances which attend its

application. That the expression of Pe may be finite, it is sufficient that for every elementary

factor ;(D) occurring in the numerator, there should correspond a similar factor
