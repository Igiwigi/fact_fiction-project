Often the behaviours that contribute to the socially undesirable practice to be changed are
themselves the norm. Think for example of activities that contribute to global warming, such as
eating meat, using air conditioning, not adopting renewable energy solutions, flying or driving
alone: these activities remain the social norm in our societies [23]. Social norms can make any


type of behaviour stable; they can be contrary to the collectively optimal outcome, and in fact
reinforce suboptimal behaviour. Examples are norms that promote blood feuds [73], hate speech
[74], compliance with protection rackets [75], corruption [76] or female genital mutilation [45]. How can we promote positive change when social norms are contrary to and, in fact, reinforce
unsustainable behaviour?
