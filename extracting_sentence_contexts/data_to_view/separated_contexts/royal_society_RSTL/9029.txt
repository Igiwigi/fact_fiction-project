Noy in these experiments the fact is sufficiently obvious that mutilations
= of any part of the organism modify the rhythm of the marginal ganglia most profoundly. S That this modification does not proceed from shock, would seem to be indicated
g by the facts that the first effect of the mutilation is to quicken the rhythm, that
s there is a sort of general proportion to be observed between the amount of tissue
2 abstracted and the degree of slowing of the rhythm produced, and that the slowing effects
= continue for 80 long a time. All these facts seem to show that we haye here something
'3 other than mere shock to deal with. A strong suspicion, therefore, arises that the cause
<4 of the slowing of the rhythm which results from removing the polypite, or a part of the
> general contractile tissue of the bell, consists in the destruction of some influence of an
= afferent character which had preyiously emanated from the parts of the organizm which
& have been removed; and that the normal rhythm before the operation was partly due
<= to a continuous reception, on the part of the ganglia, of this afferent or stimulating
S influence. In support of this view are the facts that the first effect of 8uch an operation
— as we are considering is greatly to accelerate the rhythm, and that this acceleration then
V gradually declines through a period of about a quarter of an hour, 'These facts tend to
= support this view, because, if it is correct, they are what we might anticipate.
