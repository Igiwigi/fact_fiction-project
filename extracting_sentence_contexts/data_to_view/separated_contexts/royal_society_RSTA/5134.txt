The group suggested that first operation could be
possible in 1995, in parallel with the operation of LEP (this was not the first or the last of Rubbia’s
claims that proved over-optimistic: during the ICFA workshop he had asserted that the LHC
could be built for less than $400 million). The group noted that a 2 TeV electron-positron collider
would have comparable ‘reach’ to the LHC, and could enable detailed study of phenomena
discovered at the LHC or SSC, but was not technically feasible. The group further noted that the ‘Lesser energy of LHC [relative to SSC] can be partially
‘recovered’ with the help of a larger luminosity’, but ‘experiments at more than 10° will require
novel instrumentation’, and recommended intensified R&D on high field magnets.

(c) Magnet R&D and evolution of the design of the Large Hadron Collider

Magnet R&D for the LHC (by Brianti, Perin, Leroy, Rossi and others) had in fact already started
in 1986. In 1988, a single bore 1m magnet designed at CERN and built by Ansaldo reached 9T
at 1.8K. In 1991-1993, CERN’s first 2-in-1 magnets (which were 1-1.3m in length) also reached
9T.
