epiphenomenal.

In the past few years, multiple studies have suggested that these apparently symbolic
representations do indeed play a causal role in models’ subsequent predictions, each study using
a different method to arrive at this conclusion. Early studies showed that it is possible to use


linear [51,52] or nonlinear [53] updates to a model’s hidden state in order to manipulate the
model's representation of grammatical role, e.g. causing it to treat a noun as a verb. More recently,
[54] developed a procedure for aligning individual activations of a neural network to an explicit
causal graph, and used it to show that language models’ inferences obey abstract syntactic and
semantic rules. [55] Presents a related study which intervenes on specific parts of the Transformer
architecture [56] in order to make counterfactual edits to the model’s encoding of factual
knowledge (what if Pierre Curie’s area of work is medicine?). They then observe that the model’s
subsequent inferences (e.g. expectations about Pierre Curie’s professional accomplishments)
are updated accordingly. Our own recent work has shown that it is possible to locate causal
subnetworks within a model’s weights which encode concepts such as insideness (for vision
models) or singular nounness (for language models), and that these subnetworks can often be
turned on and off with the desired effects [57].

Methods for manipulating the internal states of neural networks are very new and thus each
of these individual studies deserves scrutiny. However, the overall positive trend is consistent:
not only is it possible to align neural networks’ representations post hoc to human interpretable
concepts, but more importantly, the parts of the representation that permit this alignment are very
often the same parts of the representation that the model uses to make decisions and perform
