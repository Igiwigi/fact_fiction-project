also be present. These facts, together with the volatility of Tl,O, probably account
for the potency of thallium as an “ anti-knock.”” BLUumMENTHAL* has measured the
dissociation pressure of K,O, and K,O,; which at 450° C are about 300 and 20 mm,
respectively, so that both oxides would be present under engine conditions. There
is no evidence of the existence of Na,O; above 290° as a product of Na,Oy,. Krustinsons} states that in the range 350° to 308° CG, the dissociation pressure of pure
lead peroxide changes from 914 mm to 90 mm, so that the peroxide would not be
present, except in solid solution, at high temperatures ; the product of dissociation
is not pure PbO, and as Pb,O, has only a small dissociation pressure at 400° C,
it is probable that several oxides of lead are capable of existing at the temperatures
in the engine.
