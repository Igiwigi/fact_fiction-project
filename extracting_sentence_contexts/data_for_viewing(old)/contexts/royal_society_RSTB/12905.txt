node is given a height equal to the number of descendant tips
minus one. Node height is then scaled relative to the height of
the root and each branch length is computed as the difference in
height between the upper and lower nodes. The phylogenetic
signal—equivalent to Pagel’s A—was estimated as the proportion
of the variance that was explained by the phylogeny (the variance
explained by the phylogeny divided by the sum of the residual 3. Results
variance plus the variance explained by the phylogeny).

were under our second approach. We believe that this approach s
is the most realistic in that it reflects the temperature-dependent gq
nature b as supported by data, and it reflects the fact that this trait

is unlikely to evolve instantaneously (though it could be plastic).

This approach predicts the greatest reductions in developmental
durations, particularly in high latitudes (see Results).
