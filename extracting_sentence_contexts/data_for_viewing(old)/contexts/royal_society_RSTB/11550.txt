ence of an underlying personality factor. This lexical
hypothesis has formed the foundation of personality psychol-
ogy [31], and factor analyses on adjectives across multiple
cultures and languages have revealed the presence of five
[31] or six [32] factors. Both five- and six-factor models
(and, further, earlier models based less on lexical traditions
[33]) include a personality dimension labelled as neuroticism
or emotionality, with adjectives that define this factor includ-
ing ‘anxious’, ‘fragile’, ‘emotional’ and ‘fearful’ [32]. Since the
publication of the Disgust Scale [23], researchers have pro-
posed that disgust sensitivity should relate to neuroticism/
emotionality. Indeed, one account stated ‘it is probable that
disgust sensitivity is, in fact, a component of the neuroticism
trait’ ({10], p. 392). If correct, this proposal carries at least
two important implications for the disgust literature, and,
further, for how we understand variability in human patho-
gen avoidance. First, many of the conclusions reached
based on disgust sensitivity research might need to be reinter-
preted as reflecting broader emotionality rather than
pathogen avoidance. And second—and of particular impor-
tance to our understanding of the roots of variation in
disgust sensitivity—the same factors that shape variability
in neuroticism should also shape variability in disgust
