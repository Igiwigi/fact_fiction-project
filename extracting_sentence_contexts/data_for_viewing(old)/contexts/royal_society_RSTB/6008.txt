Looked at as a whole the essential similarity of these two casts is at once apparent.
The contours of the two casts are placed horizontally 1 cm. apart; the basal contour
is drawn on the level of a line which cuts the cast posteriorly at the lowest point of the
groove between the occipital territory and the lateral sinus and anteriorly at a point
5 mm. above the lowest point of the frontal cap. Figs. 10 and 11 are very similar to
one another, the main difference being seen in the greater height of the cast of
Sinanthropus. The vertex in Pithecanthropus is flatter. This gives the cast a more
Squat appearance. Although the vertex in Sinanthropus is higher the difference in the
two casts in this respect is not so much a matter of contrast in cortical structure, but is
due in great measure to the fact that the great longitudinal sinus in Sinanthropus has
grooved the bony parietes more deeply so that the cast of it forms a prominent feature
on the vertex. These facts are very clearly demonstrated in the examination of the
vertical sagittal contours of the lateral aspects of the right hemispheres, figs. 13 and 14.
