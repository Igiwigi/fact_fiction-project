AsT have no reason for preferring
one to the other set of results, I shall take a mean of the two sets, which, with the
differences of the coordinates or intervals between the centres of the spots, run as
follows :

Coordinates. Differences.

If we now consider that the half of 18'2 is 9'1, we might almost be led to expect a
subdivision of the spot «, with its train*, into others, one of which should have its
maximum at the fiducial point Y, and another half-way between that point and «. And though I am not disposed to attribute much weight to the fact, it is right to
mention that when paper prepared with Indian ink was used, and a very pale yellow
glass interposed between the lens and the spectrum, an oval spot, having its centre
precisely on the point Y, was actually insulated.. And this experiment, it should also
in justice be mentioned, was made prior to the assemblage and reduction of the aboye
measures, and in the absence of any speculative views concerning them.

are the atmospheres of the sun and earth.
