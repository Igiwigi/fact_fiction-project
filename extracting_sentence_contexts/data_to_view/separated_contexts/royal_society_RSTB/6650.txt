In its upper part (at about 3000 ft.) the gorge has cut through a west-dipping series of
massive red rhyolites which show comparatively little sign of fracture or folding. It
may be that this is due to the fact that they lie at too great an altitude above the main
zone of disturbance. South-west of Lorienatom at the Nakinomet road turn-off, a low scarp stands up
from the plains. It faces east and the dip slope is inclined to the west at 20Â°.
