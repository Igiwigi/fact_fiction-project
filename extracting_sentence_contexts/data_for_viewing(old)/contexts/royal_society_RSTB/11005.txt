Euclidean spaces range from metric spaces where distances
can be measured but dimensions may not be orthogonal, to
topological spaces where objects may be near or adjacent,
but distances cannot be quantified. In pre-topological spaces
objects may be in a neighbourhood, but the space is
unbounded (in contrast to the bounded Euclidean, metric
and topological spaces). For RNA the sequence space is
Euclidean but the two-dimensional phenotype space is a pre-
topological space. A set is an unbounded space where even
the concept of a neighbourhood does not apply. We tend to
apply ‘Euclidean intuitions’ [68] without inquiring into
whether the space is, in fact, Euclidean. For example, Raup’s
shell coiling model that introduced morphospaces is non-
Euclidean [69]. Moreover, apparent distances computed in
morphospaces may be misleading where constraints on vari-
ation limit the range of possible morphotypes [70]. The
evolutionary spaces described above include a range of topol-
ogies (table 1), although many spaces are often assumed to be
at least metric, if not Euclidean [4,5,68,71]. A substantial chal-
lenge in evolutionary biology, and one that has achieved
too little attention, is adjusting our Euclidean intuitions to
the evolutionary dynamics in spaces of different topologies.
