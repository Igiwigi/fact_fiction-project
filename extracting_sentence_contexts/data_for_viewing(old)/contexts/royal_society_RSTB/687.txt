the E.M.F. of the current of rest is the outcome of glandular processes of variable
activity, and is not compatible with the theory of origin of the E.M.F. in mucin-meta-
morphosis.

3. The reductions in the E.M.F. of the normal rest current following exposure of
the skin to carbonic acid gas and to the vapour of chloroform, and the subsequent
recovery upon admission of air, are strong evidence that the origin of the E.M.F. is
in some active vital processes taking place in the skin, and it is reasonable to assume
that these occur in its glandular elements.

4, The demonstration that the E.M.F. of the skin of the Eel undergoes an excita-
tory variation as a result of electrical, thermic, and mechanical stimulation, is in
accordance with what is known to occur in other glandular structures, and the fact
that such excitatory change manifests itself as a positive variation of the current of
rest agrees in the main with the phenomena observed in other cases.

5. The fact that chloroform narcosis excludes the possibility of the excitatory
variation upon stimulation at the same time as it reduces the E.M.F. of the normal
current of rest to zero, supports the assumption that the E.M.F. of the current of
rest and that of the current of action originate in one and the same source.

6. Finally, the reduction of the E.M.F. of the normally directed current of rest by
atropinisation, and the complete absence of any excitatory variation under such
conditions, are facts strongly in favour of the hypothesis that both the E.M.F. of the
current of rest and that of the current of action are from a glandular source.
