Alternatively, in the case where there are multiple stable branches, one of the branches ia
is always the trivial reference state. In this case, we assume that the reference state is chosen. This 4
assumption is based on the fact that the dead load is added to the reference state and, thus, unless 4
perturbed in some way, it will remain in this state. +
The stable equilibria are illustrated in the stochastic bifurcation diagram shown in figure 5a,
where p; =400, p2 =0.0013. Hence = p1p2=0.52, and we can see that the probability
distribution follows the stable branches of the bifurcation diagram (cf. figure 2). Moreover,
figure 5b shows that the probability of the cube presenting the trivial reference state is
approximately 50%, which matches the probability derived above.
