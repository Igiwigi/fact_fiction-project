the last crisis fade.

Decisions under uncertainty have been shown to be sensitive to the way
questions are presented. People understand probabilities better if they
are expressed in terms of natural frequencies (1 in 10000) rather than
percentages (0.01%). This is one symptom of a wider confusion over
probabilistic concepts. Research by Gerd Gigerenzer and others shows
that doctors, for example, are often misled by information presented in
the form of probabilities rather than sample frequencies. The statement
that a diagnostic test has a 5 per cent probability of a false positive is
misinterpreted more often than the statement that five patients out of
every hundred taking the test will show a false positive (e.g. [17]). This
is compounded by the fact that many forecasts are not of the kind where
reference back to a sample frequency is informative. Forecasts made today
of the weather or the inflation rate at some date in the future are unique;
they are not the outcomes of a repeated experiment. Decisions about saving
for future pension provision, for example, are difficult to make the subject
of experimentation, although we can learn from the experience of others.
People tend to follow the actions of others. That can be an effective
strategy. For example, on the game show ‘Who Wants To Be A
Millionaire?’, the ‘Ask the Audience’ lifeline has a 91 per cent success rate,
showing that there can be wisdom in crowds [18]. But experiments also
show that a substantial proportion of people choose a glaringly incorrect
answer to a simple question when told it is the answer others have chosen,
even though the same question is answered correctly in isolation (e.g. [19]).
