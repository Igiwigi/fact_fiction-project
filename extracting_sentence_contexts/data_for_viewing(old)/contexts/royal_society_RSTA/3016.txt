It should be noted that the denial of existence of a principle of causality is generally motivated
within a classical theoretical view, as it is also evident in Carroll’s citation above. As explained in
his book [8], the reason beneath such denial within classical physics is the time reversal symmetry
of Newton’s and Maxwell’s laws. A possible source of misunderstanding here may be the implicit
assumption that the absence of a law would constitute a law by itself. However, both Newton’s
and Maxwell’s theories are compatible with an additional law that picks a preferred direction of
time, as one may equally state the same laws in integral form by means of the retarded potentials
only, and using them as the law formulation, from which Newton’s and Maxwell's original laws
can be derived by differentiation, however, with the additional time-arrow restriction.

A second reasoning underlying the denial of a causality principle, again of a classical-
theoretical origin, is the same fact that classical mechanics is deterministic, and the one-to-one
correspondence between cause and effect without assuming the arrow of time (the effect occurs
after the cause) puts the two notions in one-to-one correspondence, making them interchangeable.
Such reasoning is also the origin of the traditional misidentification of the notion of causality
with that of determinism; whereas the two are logically utterly independent.3 And, indeed,
the two notions are so deeply entangled in some literature that they are often merged into the
commonplace of causal determinism. An example of such identification is the quotation by the
founding father of quantum theory, Max Planck:

An event is causally determined if it can be predicted with certainty [18].

The confusion between causality and determinism is notoriously the main source of the
common misinterpretation of perfect Einstein—Podolsky—Rosen (EPR) quantum correlations (e.g.
