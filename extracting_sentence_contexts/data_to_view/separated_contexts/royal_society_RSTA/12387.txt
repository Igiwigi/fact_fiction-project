RODGER ON THE RELATIONS —

This value is almost the same as the value of chlorine in ethylidene chlo

viz., 76, 4
It is probable, therefore, that in substituting hydrogen by chlorine in ethy'
syme ar sitailar variations take place, us in the case of ethane; for on produc

OL, CHC, and CUL:CCl,,

the first and seeond hydrogen atoms attached to a given carbon atom lave alone ly
substituted, and the above numbers show that the mean value of the chlorine is aby
the same in both cases. 1

The following table contains the values of chlorine calevlated from the moleeg)
viscosity work of the chlorine compounds examined ;—

Ib will be seen in conformity with the conclusions already stated thab
increases the vulue of chlorine always diminishes. It is alsa noticeable that whe
is the same, the value of chlorine yaries slightly with the series to which |
substance belongs, This is again evidence of the fact already mentioned t
substituting hydrogen in a methyl group, the effeet also depends upon the nat
the radicle to which the methyl group is attached,

On comparing the ditferenees between the specific inolecular yolumes of conipem
bulonging to the above series a similar variation is noticeable, as is seen in tl
following table :—
