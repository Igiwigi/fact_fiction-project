unknown to reptilian brains, is correlated probably with the differentiation of the
submammalian hypothalamus into a definite subthalamus,—a structure which in higher
mammals is known as Forex’s field H, and the field of Luys, into which the globus
pallidus discharges. There is no particular nucleus of reception for the hypothalamic
bundle. The mesencephalic tract ends in the nucleus ruber and in the substantia nigra—
a totally mammalian characteristic. A general tegmental tract (as described by HuBER
and CrosBy (1926) and a striatal-tectal connection (the  isthmic-striatal tract of
EDINGER) were not seen. Also there was no evidence of a fibre relationship between the
globus pallidus and the nucleus lateralis as described by Wrson (1914) for the monkey.

The amygdaloid complex.—Vhe discussion of the origin and homologies of the lateral
wall of the telencephalon has been characterised by the utter discordance of view and
interpretation entertained by different observers. ‘To some, the fact that the dorso-
lateral wall of the reptilian telencephalon manifests a prodigious development, compared
to the same region in amphibians, is sufficient reason for naming the area hypopallial

and concluding that it develops from cortical areas. ‘To other minds, such a fact calls

for a more conservative interpretation—that since this tissue is not the result of a

primary neuronic emigration outward to form a real cortex and a secondary one inward,
