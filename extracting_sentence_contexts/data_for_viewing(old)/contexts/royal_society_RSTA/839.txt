for i= 1,2, which is the three-dimensional version of the Majid—-Ruegg quantum space-time [14].
In its Poincaré quantum group, the momentum is commutative because its ‘enveloping algebra’
is the commutative Hopf algebra C[H3] but curved as H3 is non-Abelian. The semidual of this
on the top right is a classical model of a particle on H3 as curved position space with its classical
U(so1,3) = U(suz) >< U(h3) symmetry containing U(h3) as the translational momentum. So the roles
of position and momentum are swapped between the two models—an example of QBR. It is also
striking that the model on the right is classical (a particle on a curved space H3), while the other
model is quantum, so QBR interchanges classical and quantum.

In fact this picture q-deforms [15] as we show on the bottom line of figure 3, where the model
on the bottom right is thought to encode quantum gravity with cosmological constant via an
expression of the form q = e~r/le_ Tts QBR-dual model on the bottom left when q#1 is at some
algebraic level isomorphic to two copies of Cy[H3] = Uy(suz)°°P acting on Ug(h3) = C,g[SU2]°P up
to some technicalities, ie. a classical but q-deformed particle on a three-sphere, and this is related
by a categorical equivalence (a Drinfeld twist) to the model on the right. In other words, three-
dimensional quantum gravity with cosmological constant is in some sense self-dual under QBR.
Finally, we can take q — 1 in different ways and the first one, on the outer right, is Ap — 0 (hence a
classical but curved position space). Alternatively, we can send /, — oo and this is the model in the
centre of the figure encoding three-dimensional quantum gravity without cosmological constant
(to see this one should write Uj(so1,3) = Uq(st2) os Ug (3) = Ug(suz) >a Cq[SUz]°P up to some
technicalities, and then take the limit). The diagonal twist equivalence between this conventional
version of three-dimensional quantum gravity with U(suz) quantum space-time and the one we
