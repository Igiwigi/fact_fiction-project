It will be
seen that, for the silver alloys, the silver-bismuth curve shows the normal valency
effect, whilst with silver aluminium the freezing point depression is slightly but
systematically greater. In the copper alloys there are deviations in either direction in the
concentrated solutions, but in the dilute solutions the curves approach asymptotically
to the standard equivalent composition curve. The copper-silicon curve is, in fact,
almost indistinguishable from that for copper-germanium. We do not, of course,
suggest that any direct comparison can be made between an alloy such as copper-
bismuth where there is practically no solid solution, and an alloy such as copper-zinc,
