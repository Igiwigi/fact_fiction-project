visible vascular supply: though SyKes (1910), by continuing an imaginary line,
suggests that some traces ought to belong to it, and Lienrer and Tison (1912) have
traced slender strands of undifferentiated tissue just into the base where it is slightly
more massive, though without any indication whatever of the four hypothetical
catpels. To this structure the term “integument” may still be applied (Hooker,
1864) : no evidence is so far forthcoming that it can be regarded as an “ ovary-wall”
(Srraspurcer, 1872; Lienrer and Trson, 1911), The most reliable evidence
concerning these structures should be obtained from developmental stages ; and these
are readily obtained without any difficulty from the axils of the uppermost scales of
a functional cone.

Stages of development have been more or less illustrated by Hooker (1864) and
McN zs (1872) and others, but the main facts are still somewhat confused. Drawings
of early stages are given (figs. 5-8) for sectional elevations of transparent buds
seen from the anterior side ; while sections of the cone-apex give median elevations for
stages numbered in agreement with the tangential ones (fig. 5). It may be noted
that observation of floral development is mainly a question of plotting curves: the
time has passed when freehand drawings of primordia are of any real use. All such

figures require to be (1) planned carefully to the same scale, so far as possible ; (2) all
curves to be followed with the greatest exactness ; (3) the figures should be sufticiently
large to express the ultimate detail due to cellular structure, and (4) the relative size
of the cell-units should be indicated for comparison with that of the primordia. Figures
in which the individual cells of the young meristems are 1 or 2 mm, in diameter are
to be preferred. Such developmental figures indicate in a manner which can be
