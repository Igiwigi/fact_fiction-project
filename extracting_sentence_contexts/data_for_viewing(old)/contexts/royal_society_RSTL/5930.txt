The Naidea, Lumbricidea, Hirudinea, 'Terebellidze, Nereide, &c. will on this ground
be taken in the order in which they are named.

Naidea.—lIn his Report* on the Annelids, the author made the following statement
with reference to the segmental organ in the genus Nats: © The whote reproductive
system is limited by Ducts to the glandular mass which is s0 readily observed about the
anterior third of the body, whereas in reality this only constitutes one 8eqmental unit,
more developed only than those which are repeated in every ring of the body.”
Although in the present memoir the author will avail himself of the opportunity to cor-
rect certain inaccuracies committed in his * Report ” with respect to the interpretation
there given in relation to the segmental organ in Nats, he will only at present observe,
that in 1852 he drew attention to the fact that the generative structures were developed
upon one, two or more of the segmental organs common to almost every ring of the
body.

To M. Ducks the segmental organs, as distributed throughout the two posterior
thirds of the body, were unknown. No special description of them has been given by
any subsequent anatomist. It is doubtful whether the genus Nazs is included by Ley-
DIG in his recent memoirf, © Ueber den Bau und die systematische Stellung der Rader-
thiere,” while incidentally referring to the family of the Lumbricidea, Whether this
be the case or not, the author is not acquainted with any special account of this organ
in this group of Annelids.

The following description is drawn entirely from his own researches :—
