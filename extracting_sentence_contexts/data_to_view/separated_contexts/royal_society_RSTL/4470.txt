possible, it will be necessary to consider it in this paper with others of equal import-
ance and probably of more general use. The system of countersinking the rivets is only used when smooth surfaces are re-
quired ; under other circumstances their introduction would not he desirable, as they
do not add to the strength of the joint, but to a certain extent reduce it. This re-
duction is not observable in the experiments, but the simple fact of sinking the head
of the rivet into the plate and cutting out a greater portion of metal, must of necessity
lessen its strength, and render it weaker than the plain joint with raised heads. This
must appear evident from the fact of the sectional area of the plate being diminished,
and the consequent reduction of the heads of the rivets, which in this state are less
able to sustain the effects of an oblique or transverse strain. It is, however, satisfactory to observye that countersinking the heads of the rivets
does not seriously injure the joint in its powers of resistance to a direct tensile force ;
but the rivets are liable to start when exposed to collisions or a strong impinging
force, such as the sides of ships are frequently doomed to encounter.
