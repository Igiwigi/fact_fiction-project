the following reasons. In the mammalian skull, the basal plate between the cochlear
capsules is relatively narrower than it is further posteriorly ; the foramen acusticum is
SS at some little distance from this flat portion of the basal plate ; and the facial foramen

beneath its suprafacial commissure is mounted on the top of the cochlear capsule.
In the amphibian skull, on the other hand, the basal plate is of the same width anteriorly
as posteriorly ; the foramen acusticum is formed at the lateral edge of the basal plate ;
and the facial foramen behind its prefacial commissure is at the edge of the flat basal
plate, and in front of the (canalicular) part of the auditory capsule. In addition, in
Echidna (Gaurp, 1908), before chondrification sets in, the tissue surrounding the ductus
cochlearis is in direct continuity with that from which the basal plate is formed-

8 ‘These facts led Gaver to the conclusion (1900, p. 583) that ‘* Grob mechanisch ausge-
1 driickt kann man sagen, dass bei den Amnioten der Ductus cochlearis in die Basalplatte
i hineingewachsen sei und einen ‘Teil derselben zur Pars cochlearis umgestaltet habe.”

. . . “Die vordere Kuppel der Ohrkapsel bei den Siiugern entspricht somit nicht der
vorderen Kuppel bei den Amphibien oder den Sauriern, sondern entspricht dem
vorderen lateralen Abschnitt der Basalplatte der genannten Vormen.”

‘This view was opposed, and the second alternative put forward, by NoorDENBOS (1905).
He observed in Talpa that the cochlear part of the auditory capsule chondritied together
with the canalicular part and separately from the basal plate, with which it became
