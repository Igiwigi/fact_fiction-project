ON ELECTRICAL DISCHARGES THROUGH RAREFIED GASES. 175

usually followed by an apparently complete cessation of discharge ; ib then recom-
menced, and continued to exhibit during its entire period of existence variations of a
very irregular kind. It is, in fact, probable that during the period subsequent to the
first outburst and the momentary cessation of discharge that often follows it, the state
of the tube is much the same as it would be during a continuous discharge, in
consequence of the absence of any regularity of pulsation. The tube is always
conducting a discharge, although perhaps the consequent disturbance is more violent
in one part than in another. There is no alternation of a sharply-defined discharge and
electrical emptiness.
