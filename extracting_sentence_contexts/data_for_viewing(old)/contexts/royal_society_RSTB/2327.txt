The size of the drop seems to be of considerable importance. When it consists
of a mere film of liquid, an abundant supply of spores is usually obtained, but when
it is large, budding seems to supersede spore-formation to a considerable extent, this
behaviour doubtless depending largely on the nature of the aération of the cells.
The influence of this factor is shown further if a tube containing about 10 cub.
centims. of distilled water is infeeted with vigorous cells.

In such a tube of distilled water, kept at 25° C., the production of spores is very
small, and large numbers of' very irregular cells are produced (fig. 6). Cells of this
type show great variety in shape, and have already been mentioned as occurring in
old colonies on plates of beer-wort gelatine and in hanging drops of the same
medium. They may now be considered in greater detail, since their nature and
form seem to receive explanation from facts observed in connection with spore-
formation,

The irregular cells are derived from ordinary yeast-like cells. The latter put out
small projections or processes, which, at first, cannot be distinguished from very
young buds, but which subsequently resemble the beaks put out by the cells in the
process of spore-formation. There may be as many as three or four such processes
developed from a single cell, in which case its resemblance to a yeast-cell is very
small, These processes again may put out small protuberances, and in cases where
these develop to any pronounced extent, a branching structure is produced. Other
processes may swell up to a greater or less extent, in which case they resemble
daughter-cells attached to the mother-cell, with communication between them. A
small oval or round cell is often completely budded off at the tip of such a process,
