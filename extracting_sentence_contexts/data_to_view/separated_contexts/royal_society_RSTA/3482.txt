The nonlinear response of
gross system value V to changes in Qmax and Lc = Lp permits quite complex economic trade-offs
between Qmax and Lc = Lp. The optimum ESD design maximizes the (positive) NPV of ESD net
earnings minus the capital cost of installing the ESD. The fact that there are sharply diminishing

Figure 4. The annuity returns added by the ESD, AResp = raV — rgV(Qmax = 0). The value is shown with Lc and Lp ranging
from 250 kW up to 1 MW (both are kept equal) and for a market with system balancing penalty parameter ¢ = 0.5.
