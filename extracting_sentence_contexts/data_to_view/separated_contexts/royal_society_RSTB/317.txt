Although it will often happen that
the cells of Cuarke’s column, as has been claimed for them by v. Lennossex* and
others, become stained more deeply than, and with an apparently different kind of
sepia tint (in, for instance, “‘ WreicerRT” preparations), to the cells of other groups,
notably of those of the ventral cornu, yet the reverse is quite frequently the case
even in sections from the same levels of the cord. Without, therefore, laying more
stress on the fact than the above limitation leaves, it is, perhaps, worthy of note that
the out-lying cells in the radicular zone are found tinted in the same degree and
manner as are the cells of the vesicular column. Also, as connecting them with CiarKe’s column is to be mentioned the peculiar
distribution of the out-lying cells in the length of the cord. I have not observed
them lower than the level of exit of the 3rd lumbar nerve-root nor higher than the
level of the exit of the 5th thoracic.
