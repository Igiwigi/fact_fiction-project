It is not
the number of melanocytes, but their mode of pigmentary activity that is responsible for
differences of colour in the animals we have studied. Part 2. THE BRANCHED CELLS OF THE EPIDERMIS

The gist of the argument to be presented in parts 2 and 3 of this paper is that certain
unpigmented branched cells to be seen in the more superficial strata of the epidermis are
the histological degradation products of the melanocytes of the lowermost stratum; that
they are, in fact, effete melanocytes in course of desquamation. The evidence is circum-
stantial, for melanocytes have not been seen to discharge their pigment and to pass out-
wards to be flaked off at the skin surface. In the present part, we shall deal one after another with the various cells believed to be
associated with pigmentary function in the epidermis, as they are revealed by various
histological techniques.
