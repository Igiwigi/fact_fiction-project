464 DR. C. CHREE, EXPERIMENTS ON ANEROID BAROMETERS

others, Nos. 52 and 55 were made at a temperature of 50° F., Nos. 53 and 54 at a
temperature of 81° F. Use was made of the room employed for testing chrono-
meters, the temperature of which is readily controlled. Information as to tempe-
rature effects is also obtainable from -the other special experiments, because, being
taken at all seasons of the year in an ordinary room, they answered to considerably
varied temperatures.

The investigation of the influence of temperature on the descending readings is
complicated by the fact that the index error of an aneroid is a somewhat variable
quantity. ‘lo get rid, so far as possible, of this uncertainty, I subtracted from all the
readings a constant equal to the error observed at 30 inches. This is equivalent to
making the instrument correct at the start of each experiment. The excesses of the
readings so modified over the true pressures at lower points of the range I shall call
the corrected errors.

Table XVIIL. shows the algebraic excess of the corrected errors from the mean of
experitnents 52 and 55 over the corrected errors from the mean of experiments
53 and 54.
