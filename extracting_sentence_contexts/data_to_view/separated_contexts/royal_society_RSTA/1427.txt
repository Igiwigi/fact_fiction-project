If a specimen
of elliptical cross-section be distorted by shear on a system of parallel planes having
a common direction of slip, it is apparent that the direction of displacement of neigh-
bouring particles will vary from a direction perpendicular to the boundary to one
tangential to the boundary. Hence, if the polished surface of such a distorted specimen
is viewed through a (reflecting) metallurgical microscope, the intensity of the shadows
(representing the slip-bands) will vary from a maximum value through zero value to
the same maximum value twice as the specimen rotates through 360°. In the present
instance, the fact that the “gaps” observed had definite regular widths is explained
by the absence of a perfect surface and also by the limits of resolution of the
optical system employed. The slip-bands faded away as the gaps were approached,
and the width of the latter was approximately 0”-02. The positions of the centres
of the gaps could, however, be estimated with considerable accuracy, and were
found to coincide with the reference marks 2 and 8.
