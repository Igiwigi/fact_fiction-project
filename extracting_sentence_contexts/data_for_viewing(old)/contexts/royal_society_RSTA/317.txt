Figure 6. Classical feedback diagram: the junctions circled are not implementable in the quantum
setting as they correspond to copying of information. Instead, they must be replaced by unitary
junctions such as a beam splitter. (Online version in colour.)

(c) Quantum feedback networks

The efficacy of input-state-output models in classical control theory lies in the
fact that one can represent them by block diagrams, as in figure 4, and then
connect them up to form networks. The diagram in figure 6 illustrates the
feedback set-up found in standard engineering textbooks. However, quantum
mechanically we cannot proceed this way!

(i) Cascaded systems

The simplest form of a network consists of a pair of cascaded systems,
as shown in figure 7. In the instantaneous feedforward limit, the output
of the second plant is dBO = dB + Indt= (5 dBO + Lydt) + Indt=
