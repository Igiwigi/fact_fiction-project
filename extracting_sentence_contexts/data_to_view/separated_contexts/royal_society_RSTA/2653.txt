Despite the high modulus of natural gas hydrates in the context of solid fouling materials, to
the best of our knowledge, no work has been done to investigate the effects of surface modulus on
meso- and macro-scale adhesion of these materials. Owing to the extreme similarity in modulus
and chemical composition between ice and clathrates [36], it is reasonable to assume that many
surface design strategies may be shared effectively between the two fouling scenarios. In fact, the
CVD surfaces fabricated by Sojoudi et al. [97] were also applied to mitigate ice fouling; however,
these surfaces were able to reduce ice adhesion strength to only tice = 185.3 kPa. In comparison,
as discussed previously, durable, low-modulus surfaces achieved values of tice < 10 kPa [108]. Therefore, by considering the high modulus of this foulant and incorporating surface elasticity
into low hydrate adhesion surface design, significant additional reduction in adhesion strength
may be achieved.
