Preface

The term episodic memory was proposed by Endel â€˜Tulving in the early 1970s to refer to the
capacity to recollect specific events or episodes in our lives. This provided a contrast with
semantic memory, the system assumed to store factual knowledge of the world. At a pragmatic
level, this created a useful distinction that has now become universally accepted. More
controversial, however, was the question of whether these two concepts referred to separate
memory systems or to a single system operating under different constraints.
