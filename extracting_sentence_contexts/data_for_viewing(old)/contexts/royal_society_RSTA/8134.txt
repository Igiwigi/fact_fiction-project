For comparison the values of 20 and 2¢ are given in columns 10 and 11. It will
be seen that they are equal to one another, the greatest observed difference between them
being only 1 degree.

Relationship between y. and v.—Referring to formule (12) and (17) it will be seen
that a value of f/e = 0-01 makes the factor

—1+ 2fle
1+3f/e

equal to — 0-974, so that the relationship between » and v would in that case be
v/p = 0-974 (cos 2¢/cos 20). The difference of the factor cos 2¢/cos 20 from 1-00
owing to the fact that the measured values of 0 and ¢ are not exactly equal to one
another is as great as the greatest deviation of the factor (—1 + 2f/e)/(1+3f/e)
from 1-00. We have already seen that values of f/e are so small as to be within the
limits of experimental error, so that the variations of the measured values of »/v from
unity are due mainly to the deviation of the measured value of 6 from exact equality
with the measured value of ¢. The values of » = — cos 20 and vy = ye cos 26

are given in columns 12 and 13 of Table VI and the results are marked in fig. 1¢
for comparison with the results of experiments with metal tubes.

In conclusion we wish to express our thanks to Professor Ineuis for allowing the work
to be done in the Engineering Laboratory at Cambridge, to Messrs. Toomas Bouton &
Sons for the trouble they took to produce suitable copper tubes for us, to Messrs. AccLES
