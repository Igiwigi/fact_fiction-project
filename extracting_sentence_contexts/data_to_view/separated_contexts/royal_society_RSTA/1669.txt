However, it is frustrating to realize that there are no guaranteed cosmological signals for such
exotica. Hence exploration of the unknown becomes difficult to justify when in competition
with missions that advertise guaranteed science goals. This is despite the fact that the historical
record demonstrates that such a new horizon approach is an invaluable part of humanityâ€™s drive
to explore the universe with the prospect of vast but unforeseeable returns. In fact by being
sufficiently ambitious, guaranteed science central to cosmology is achievable via a CMB spectral
distortion experiment. More specifically, spectral distortions provide a unique window that exposes the physics of the
very early universe, and provide a fundamental test of the Big Bang theory, if one can overcome
the various foregrounds.
