The detection and classification of such plumes in an efficient way would
reduce the risk of harmful exposures [1,2]. Recent advances in technology have provided hardware capability to easily measure the
reflection energy from a large region and to generate hyperspectral images that can be used

to spot and classify chemical plumes. A hyperspectral image is, in fact, a picture taken over a 3
large number of frequencies by means of special sensors. The data produced are a hypercube : 5
whose layers are two-dimensional images each corresponding to a different frequency. Hence : 5
each pixel of the hypercube contains a spectral signature of the corresponding physical region 1p
