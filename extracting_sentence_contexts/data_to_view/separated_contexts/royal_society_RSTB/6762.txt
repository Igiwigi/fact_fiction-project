26, 46, Plate 17), but at the end of the first meiotic division they appear V-shaped
(cf. fig. 54, Plate 18). This V is not caused by a bend in the middle of each chromosome
but is due to the fact that each is already split in preparation for the next division,
and the split halves diverge from the terminal attachment constriction. Were the
attachment constriction median, the split halves would diverge from both sides of it
to produce an X shape. This relation between the position of the spindle attachment
and the shape of the split chromosomes at anaphase of the first meiotic division is
well known, having been explained first by Gr√©goire (1910) and in greater detail by
Janssens (1924).
