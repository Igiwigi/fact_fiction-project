head of an observer at a distance. On the contrary, when travelling with the wind,
the wave-front is continually tilted downwards, thus explaining the familiar fact that
sound may be more easily heard, and at a greater distance, when the observer is to
leeward of the source. This explanation was given independently by Rrynoups*
and confirmed by a number of observations. These conclusions have been supported,
on the whole, by the results of the various fog-signal tests already referred to
During the last few years, through the development of aviation, a great deal of
attention has been directed to the investigation of the structure of the atmosphere.
