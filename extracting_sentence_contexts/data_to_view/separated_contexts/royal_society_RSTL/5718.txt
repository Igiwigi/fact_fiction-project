This might haye been pretty confidently predicted ; for
as congestion is a necessary consequence of the disorder produced in the tissues by irri-
tants, we might have been almost sure that the return of the vital fluid to that healthy
condition in which it is fit for free transmission through the vessels, must be pre-
ceded by a restoration of the living solids to their normal state. In the case alluded to,
however, no 8ign of recovery of the pigment-cells appeared till after the circulation had
become re-established ; and even when several hours had elapsed, they still remained
paralysed in the central part of the area on which the ammonia had acted. This is in
harmony with the fact lately pointed out, that, complete suspension of the pigmentary
functions may accompany a state of the blood short of actual stagnation; and both
appear to depend upon the circumstance that the chromatophorous cells are an ex-
tremely delicate form of tissue. The rate of recovery of the pigment-cells varies greatly, however, in different cases,
and in this respect much depends upon the nature of the irritant. An example of an
agent of this class producing only very transient effects on the pigmentary functions is
presented by carbonic acid.
