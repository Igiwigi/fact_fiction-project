of the early—but recurring—challenges of attempting to define metals and non-metals in the
periodic table.

Many elements, although not all of them, have the peculiar lustre, opacity, malleability, and
the high thermal and electrical conductivities peculiar to the metals. ... But elements are
far from all being metals. Those which do not possess the physical properties of metals
are called non-metals. These two classes of elements are clearly distinguished in certain
definite examples, but in some cases the distinction is not clear, and hence cannot serve as
a basis for the exact division of the elements into two groups

This issue of the intermediate nature of certain elements between the two groups—metals
and non-metals—raised by Mendeleev where .. . the distinction is not clear ..., of course, relates
to the strange status in the p-block elements (p-block elements are unified by the fact that their
outermost electrons are in the p orbital; the p-block is on the right side of the periodic table and
includes elements from column 13 to column 18. Helium, which is in the top of column 18, is not
included in the p-block) as ‘metalloids’, meaning elements with ... metal likeness, indicating they
resemble metals only somewhat. As with many general terms, the word metal is used in different
ways, particularly when trying to understand the issue of elements straddling the demarcation
line in (what we now term) the p-block of the periodic table (figure 1).

Mendeleev’s papers of 1869 [4,5], in addition to his proposed periodic table of the elements,
contained suggestions for three other possible representations. It is interesting to note that, in
a footnote to this paper, Mendeleev discussed a representation of the periodic system that he
