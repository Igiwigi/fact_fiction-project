the meantime the facts already known furnish to the unaided senses indisputable proof
of the fundamental principle to which we were led by microscopical observation, viz,
that the tissues through which the blood flows have, when healthy, special relations to
the vital fluid, by virtue of which it is maintained in a fit state- for transmission
through the vessels. Further, the differences of adhesiveness in the corpuscles accord-
ing as the blood is surrounded by healthy tismnes or ordinary matter, can now be no
longer matter of surprise, knowing as we do the alterations which take place in the
chemical condition of the liquor sanguinis in consequence of such changes of circum-
stances, and also the great effect produced upon the adhesiveness of the red discs in
blood outside the body by slight variations in the quality of the plasma *.

The freedom from attraction for the fibrine, if not the actual repulsion of it, on the part
of the walls of healthy blood-vessels, seems to explain the well-known fact in pathology,
that when healthy capillaries are subjected to abnormal pressure in consequence of venous
obstruction, the fluid squeezed through their parietes consists almost exclusively of sexum;
the fibrine being apparently excluded from their pores as liquid mercury is from those
of flannel, or any other texture composed of a material destitute of attraction for it.

From the speedy coagulation of lymph effused into the interstices of inflamed organs
or upon inflamed serous surfaces, compared with the length of time that blood has been
known to remain fluid after being poured out into such situations in a/state of health,
and also-from the. deposition of fibrine "which occurs at an early period upon the lining
membrane of the vessels in arteritis or phlebitis, whether in the limited inflammation
which results from the application of a ligature, or in the more extensive affection which
is apt to occur spontaneously, it would appear that the liquor sanguinis, like the corpus
