Since ¢,, ¢,¢ R(Z), this is possible only when ¢, = é5, i.e. when (7;,9,) = (72,42). This proves
the remark. ;

(b) It is impossible that Ay = Ag =1, fy = 6\(1+2), fy = (142). If we substitute these
values in (7-7), we get ese eels
which is impossible for units €,, €,¢ R(z) except when ¢, = ¢.

(c) It is impossible that A, = Ay = 1-1, fy = 5 fly = €y. This follows as in (5).

(d) At most four regions meet at a node. By interchanging (y,,0,) with (no, 05), if necessary, we can
have only A lee fa eek). Apt i ee

Except for the fact that ¢, = ¢,, this follows at once from (a), (6) and (c). That ¢,= ¢,
follows at once from (7-7).

By putting (¢,y, ¢,0) for (y,d) this gives us case ¢ of the theorem. That the angles are as
shown follows from figure 4 in the /-plane.

This concludes the proof of the theorem.
