(9.) This curve accordingly stands in the same relationship to the skew binomial
as the normal curve to the symmetrical binomial.* There are several points, however,
to be considered with regard to it. In the first place it is usually assumed that n is
indefinitely great’ and ¢ indefinitely small, and then it is supposed that we may
neglect (p — q) cX’,.,, as compared with pq (n + 1), and so we deduce the normal
error curve whether p be equal to q or not. But I contend that this is unjustifiable
except for very small values of X’,,,. When the deviation X’ is considerable and
¢ vanishingly small, X’ will be an indefinitely great multiple of ¢ ; ¢ must be in fact
the unit in which X’ is measured and unless p = q, the ordinary normal curve is only
an approximation, even if n be large, near the maximum frequency. In the next
place, when we speak of 7 being large, are we quite clear as to what we mean in the case
of physical or biological frequency curves? We speak of a multiplicity of small
“causes” determining the actual dimensions of an organ, or the size of a physical
error, or the height of the barometer. But it is less clear why this multiplicity
should be identified with the infinite greatness of n. If we take Dr. VENn’s
frequency curve for barometric height, we see that the closest point-binomial is by no
means consistent with either p= gq, or with n being indefinitely great. Further,
many statistical results in games of chance are given with great exactness by the
normal curve, although we are then able to show that n is quite moderate.
