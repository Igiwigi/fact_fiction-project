organization ; that is the basis upon which all scientific recent botany rests, and no mere
external appearances can outweigh the positive testimony of organization in fossil types.
But whilst thus insisting upon the supreme value of structure as a guide, T am not blind
to the importance of a mass of evidence that has been deriyed from the study of external
forms, and especially that for which we are indebted to my two friends, Dr. Dawso0x, of
Montreal, and M. GraxD' Evusy, of Saint Etienne, in France. Whilst many of the SPe-
cimens which I have described have unquestionably been atrial 8ems, the minute size
of others makes it exceedingly probable that they were small branches ; nevertheless
there is no variation in the structure of these two classes of organs, beyond what has
arisen from the gradual absorption of the pith as the plant increased in age. But we
have in this difference the first clue to the history of the common fossil forms. Tt has
often been observed that very small Calamites were exceedingly rare, leading to innu-
merable surmises as to the cause of this fact.

The specimens of Calamites usually seen are casts of the interior of the wood-cylinder
of the stem, either composed of sandstone or of shale, and are generally coyered with a
thin homogeneous layer of carbonaceous matter, The early writers almost invariably
turned these specimens upside down, believing their obtuse or conical bases to be the
uppermost extremities of the stems, These observers experienced further difficulties in
the cireumstance that whilst the internal casts were fluted longitudinally and marked at
intervals by transverse constrictions, similar features were exhibited, more or less strongly,
by the external surface of the carbonaceous covering of each specimen. Hence the
apparent probability naturally suggested itself, that in the living plant one calamitean
structure had existed in the interior of another. But it was invariably believed that the
internal Calamite represented a solid pith that had disappeared from the inorganic decom-
