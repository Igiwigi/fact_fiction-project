stance of the envelopes which usually disappeared earliest, becoming at first gradually
fainter, and then more undefined in outline. This change was supposed to be due to
a gradual difluence of the substance of the spermatozoon, through the influence of
the water imbibed by the envelopes; but whether this happened as part of the fecun-
datory process, or whether it was simply the natural process of decay, as other cir-
cumstances to be mentioned seemed to intimate, there was no distinct proof, It
was remarkable, however, with reference to the act of fecundation, that in almost
every instance, even of those spermatozoa which never arrived at the vitelline mem-
brane, the body portion was always directed towards the yelk, usually peripherally,
but sometimes inclined at slight angles to one side or the other; thus showing that
It is invariably the body portion which penetrates.

* That this is really the fact, and that the actual penetration by the spermatozoon into the yelk chamber
was observed on this occasion, is now rendered almost certain by my recent observations stated in the preceding
note, p. 271.â€”G, N., April 18, 1853,

It may be matter of surprise, that, considering the immense quantity of spermatozoa
which exist even in a microscopic drop of fluid, and considering also the abundance
which come in contact with the surface. of the egg, even when' but a small quantity
of fluid is employed, as in artificial impregnation, a much,,greater number. do not
