be calcium carbonate hexahydrate. This phase became more abundant as more Calgon
was used. At 30 p.p.m. the irregular growth of calcite gave way to prolific formation of the
hexahydrate. At 50 p.p.m. the spherical grains were almost unchanged in size, and growth
was almost wholly as needles of the hexahydrate (figure 6, plate 1). When 200 p.p.m. of
Calgon was added to the sodium carbonate, the hexahydrate grew in a variety of crystalline
habits. Needles, aggregates of needles and twinned forms were all observed in a number
of repeat experiments under apparently similar conditions. Experiments with 500 p.p.m.
of Calgon gave results like those with 200 p.p.m.

An observation on the appearance of the magma in the crystallizing vessel during these
experiments is of interest. Whenever more than about 25 p.p.m. of Calgon was used in the
sodium carbonate solution and the hexahydrate was a product of the reaction, a milky
turbidity developed in the aqueous phase at an early stage in the experiment; in fact
calcium carbonate hexahydrate was never observed to be formed from clear solutions; it
appeared to be the product of crystallization of an amorphous or gel-like calcium carbonate.

(d) Absorption of phosphorus compound by the solid during growth

Buchrer & Reitemeier (1940) measured the phosphorus contents of calcium carbonate
precipitates formed from dilute solutions in the presence of known initial amounts of
‘sodium hexametaphosphate’. They considered that their results indicated adsorption of
phosphorus compound on the calcium carbonate surfaces, which in turn was responsible
for the subsequent habit distortion.
