one state of things exists, of one form, and ab another time t” of another form. This
is, however, not 80; the form of a collection is absolutely invariable. The apparent
alteration of form arises from overlooking the fact that the units dealt with are not
z, y, 2, &c., but (& at time tf), (y ab time ?), &c., ( at time t'), (y at; time t'), &c. The
unit (@ at time ?) may be quite different from (« at time 7”). Where there is only one
alternative t, the collection (z at time ?), (4 at time 7), (2 at time ft), &c., is of the same
form as the collection z, y, 2, &c., and it matters not which is the collection dealt with.
