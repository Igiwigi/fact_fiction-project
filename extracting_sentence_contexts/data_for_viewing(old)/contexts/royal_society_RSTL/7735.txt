The construction of this instrument was commenced in the beginning of 1867 by
Mr. Cooks, on a plan which had been arranged between us, but unfortunately it was
never finighed. Mr. Cook's health was then already failing, and at last, at the end of
the year, he begged me to consider the order cancelled. Under these cireumstances, at
the beginning of the present year I sought the assistance of Mr. BrowNING; but the

construction was further delayed, partly on account, of an illness which necessitated my
absence from England. At last the instrument, which reflects great credit on
Mr. BrowN1xG's 8kill, arrived on the 16th of October, 1868, not quite complete, but in
a condition which enabled me to commence work.

I mention these facts, first to account for my apparent inaction, and secondly in order
that the coincidence in time of my results with those obtained by the observers of the

recent eclipse may not be misinterpretedF.

+ October 11, 1869.—It is important that I should be allowed further to emphasize this remark, for M. Fars,
who was unaware of the date on which my new Spectroscope was received, has stated (Comptes Rendus, t, Ixvii.
