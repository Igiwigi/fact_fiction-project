FLAME SPECTRA AT HIGH TEMPERATURES. 1073

The Constitution of the Bessemer Spectrum.

It will be readily understood from the previous investigations of the flame-spectra
of iron, manganese, spiegel-eisen, ferro-manganese, silico-spiegel, tool-steel, pure man-
ganic oxide, carbon, carbonic oxide, and cyanogen, that the Bessemer-flame spectrum
is not characterised especially by the bands of carbon, a8 would be the case according
to the views of Roscor, nor of carbonic oxide according to Lrenece and Kupet-
WIESER, nor does it belong entirely to manganese as indicated by the observations of
Brunner, VON LICHTENFELS, and WeppING; furthermore, it cannot be attributed

achiefly to manganie oxide, as stated by Warts. It is, in fact, a complex spectrum,
Nin which the bands of metallic manganese, carbon, carbonic oxide, and cyanogen,
2 possibly also of manganic oxide, are superposed ; and the lines of iron and manganese
Zoccur with those of other elements, such as hydrogen, lithium, potassium, and sodium.
“#AThe hydrogen line (C in the solar spectrum) was photographed only once, and then
= during a snowstorm, when it appeared completely reversed. No absorption bands
©were at any time visible when observations were made upon the flame only. No
Snitrogen bands were seen. No bands belonging to calcium and magnesium oxides
were visible, nor lines of these elements. No cobalt, nickel, copper, nor chromium
Z were detected. The lines beyond the solar line K, which had hitherto not been
3 examined, are nearly all lines of iron, as mapped by Cornu and RowLanp in the
Ssolar spectrum, and observed in the are-spectrum of iron photographed by Kayser
and Runer.
