I had meanwhile attempted over and over again to isolate the Schizomycete, and
examine its properties in pure cultures, and at last succeeded in doing this. It seems now almost ridiculous that I should have failed so long in obtaining
satisfactory pure cultures; but, although it is easy enough to separate the Schizo-
mycete now, when I know something of its vagaries, the difficulties were natural so
long as I looked only for the sheathed and gelatinous form. As a matter of fact, I
had isolated the organism long before this, but it was then regarded—at any rate
provisionally—as a separate species, to be worked out as time and opportunity
admitted. Be this as it may, the first time I thoroughly satisfied myself that my tubes con-
tained the Schizomycete was on February 27, 1890, when I found that a culture in
Haypvcr’s solution presented the following appearances. The liquid in the upper
two-thirds of the tube was clear, but a sort of cushion of jelly-like substance had
formed at the bottom of the tube.
