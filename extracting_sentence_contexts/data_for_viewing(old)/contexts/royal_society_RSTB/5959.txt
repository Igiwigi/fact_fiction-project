two strains. The remaining sixteen failed to grow and finally disintegrated, although

tests were confined to hyphe in an apparently vigorous condition. Tips producing
DH, were of the thin type, as was also the one from which the mixture originated ;

those giving DH, were either thick or thin, fig. 4. Owing to the fact that so few DH,
cultures were obtained, no relation could be established between the type of hypha
and the nature of its subsequent growth.

Representatives of both thick and thin hyphe disintegrated, the first sign of the
process being a shrinkage in length observable twelve to fourteen hours after cutting.
The breakdown of a tip cut very small may possibly have been due to the absence of
a nucleus, but this can hardly apply to disintegration of those tips which included
a number of branches, since staining of DH, hyphe has revealed the presence of a
delimiting cross-wall at the base of each branch.

The smallest tip found to grow was 0-2 mm. in length. No unusual features were
noticeable in the manner of growth; each tip elongated and produced new branches
