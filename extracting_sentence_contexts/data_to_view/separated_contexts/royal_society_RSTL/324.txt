could determine the result of these affinities, but no proof has
been given, from the examination of the mixture, after apply-
ing phosphorus to red hot marble ; such as finding that car-
bonic acid was really decompounded, because there was a defi-
ciency of this elastic fluid, and that the charcoal and phosphoric
acid corresponded to this deficiency. Accordingly some che-
mists have conjectured that the small quantity of charcoal af-
forded in this experiment pre-existed in the phosphorus, which,
it is well known, is distilled from charcoal ; and others have sus-
pected that it might have arisen from accidental impurities. As experience, also, has taught us that phosphorated mineral

alkali will not yield phosphorus by exposure to charcoal and
heat, unless plumbum corneum be added, we cannot infer that
the carbonic acid in mild mineral alkali will be decompounded
by phosphorus ; because, as in the case of bone-ashes and phos-
phorus, the joint affinities between respirable air and phos-
phorus, and between phosphoric acid and mineral alkali, are,
by this fact, shown to be not inferior to the conjoined affinities
between charcoal and respirable air, and between carbonic
acid and that alkali. No other conclusion can be drawn with
respect to the affinities exerted when charcoal is applied to
phosphorated vegetable alkali ; because the affinity is stronger
between the phosphoric acid and vegetable alkali, than be-
tween the same acid and mineral alkali. As the attractive forces
between phosphoric acid and barytes, and between that acid
and magnesia are, very probably, at least equal to those be-
tween phosphoric acid and fixed alkalies, the question, whe-
ther carbonic acid united to these earths can be decomposed
by phosphorus, remains to be determined by experiments.
