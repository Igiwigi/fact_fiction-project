It is clear that this expression diverges both at the indenter position, p > 0, and at the edge of the
wrinkled zone, p ~ 1.195!/?. Our assumption in the analysis leading to (5.27) was that variations
in m occur only slowly with p; while this remains plausible as p — 0 (since then m~ pl), it
is clearly not the case as p > 1.1951/?. In fact, near the edge of the wrinkles there is a spatial
boundary layer in which this divergence is resolved; we discuss this further in §7 but for now
proceed by approximating Ktens as

Combining the expression for the two stiffnesses with (5.27) the radial variation of the
wavenumber is then approximately described, for 5 >> 1, by

We now compare this result with the results of our finite-element analysis.

6. Comparison between ‘Far from threshold’ analysis and ABAQUS

The preceding analysis resulted in a (relatively) simple prediction for the spatial variation of
the number of wrinkles, m(p), in the limit of very large indentation depths 5>1. The scaling
behaviour m~t1/? has been predicted previously [17,18].
