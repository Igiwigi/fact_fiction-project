If that should be the case, instead of despising these poor crea-
tures for their attachment to a useless and loathsome habit, we
should be disposed to admire their ingenuity, or rather to admire
and adore the goodness of their invisible guardiawand instructor,
who teaches them to like, and to practice, what he knows to be
useful to them. :

'The Hottentots besmear themselves, and cover their bodies,
in a manner $till more disgusting. They think themselves fine,
when they are besmeared and dressed out according to the
loathsome custom of their country. But who knows whether they
may not in fact be more comfortable, and better able to support
the excessive heats to which they are exposed? From several
experiments which I made, with a view to elucidate that point,
(of which an account will be given to this Society at some future
period,) I have been induced to conclude, that the Hottentots

derive advantages from that practice, exactly similar to those
which negroes derive from their black colour.

Â© It cannot surely be supposed, that I could ever think of re-
commending seriously to polished nations, the filthy practices of
these savages. That is very far indeed from being my inten-
tion; for I have ever considered cleanliness as being s0 indis-
pensably necessary to comfort and happiness, that we can have
no real enjoyment without it; but still, I think that a knowledge
of the physical advantages which those savages derive from such
practices, may enable us to acquire the same advantages, by
employing more elegant means.
