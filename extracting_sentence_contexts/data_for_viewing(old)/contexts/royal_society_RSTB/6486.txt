renders it clear that the cuticle cannot arise in a manner similar to that described by
YONGE (19325) for the decapod Crustacea, and it must therefore arise either by the
transformation of the peripheral layers of chitin into a cuticular substance, or in a
manner similar to that described for Rhodnius prolixus by WIGGLESWORTH (1933), Where
he suggests that the underlying epithelium secretes the cuticle first, followed by the
chitin afterwards. The former suggestion is supported by the fact that the chitin of the
radula changes its properties with age. This was shown by Sottas (19074, 6), who
demonstrated that the young and old portions of the radula differed in chemical and
physical properties, and by Pantin and Rocers (1925), who found that the older
portion of the radula of Buccinum undatum, unlike the younger portion, was amphoteric.

The reaction of chitin and cuticle to stains as shown by a study of the buccal mass
of Jorunna is not in agreement with the results gained by YoncE in the decapod
Crustacea. This affords further support to the idea that the cuticle in Jorunna does not
arise in a manner similar to that described by Yonce for cuticle of the decapods.
YONGE states that the chitin and cuticle always stain differently. This was not found
to be so in Jorunna, as Table I on p. 181 shows. Moreover, Professor CANNON has
informed me privately that he has not found this difference of staining reaction between
