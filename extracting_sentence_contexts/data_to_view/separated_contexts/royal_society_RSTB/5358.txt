G. R. DE BEER ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SKULL OF THE SHREW. 443

In Sorex, the anterior or preoptic root abuts on the planum antorbitale on a level
with the 3rd primary ethmoturbinal, and therefore well in front of the hind end of
the nasal capsule. That the ala orbitalis should be attached to the lamina orbito-
nasalis must be due to the fact that the latter structure has been forced back by the
backward extension of the nasal sac. No structure was found in Sorex capable of identification with the ala hypochiasmatica
of other forms (Tatusia, Fawcrerr, 1921; Man, Kernan, 1916). mice WV.
