with Farapay’s remarkable books “Chemical Manipulation” and “ Experiments in
Chemistry and Physics.” On many occasions he has drawn attention to the fact that
FaRapay was interested in and experimented on alloy steels, but he freely confesses that
he had not appreciated the full importance and significance of this work until the
opportunity arose of examining the specimens which Farapay prepared.


FARADAY’S “STEEL AND ALLOYS.” 229

In August of last year the author saw a few of these specimens of Farapay’s steel
at the Science Museum, South Kensington, where they had been placed on exhibition,
under the care of Sir Henry Lyons, F.R.S., during the recent period of reconstruction of
the Royal Institution building. In view of the fact that a general exhibition of
Farapay’s instruments, apparatus and othermaterial was to be held during the Farapay
Celebrations at the Albert Hall, under the management of a special Committee, with
Colonel Vianoues as its Chairman, the author suggested that it would be interesting
and appropriate to have these specimens of Farapay’s steel subjected to analysis and
other examination. He further discussed this suggestion with Sir Wituiam Brace,
F.R.S., Fullerian Professor of Chemistry, Director of the Laboratory and Superintendent
of the House, who now occupies the position so long held by Farapay himself. Tt was
recognised that Farapay’s researches on steel alloys and his own account thereof would
acquire a new and greater interest if some of his actual specimens could be completely
examined by the latest methods. It was therefore with much pleasure and satisfaction
that on November 3rd, 1930, the author received an official letter from the Royal
Institution stating that the Managers saw no objection to his proposal and granted
