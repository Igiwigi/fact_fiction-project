Here, Fj is a Lagrange multiplier to enforce the final time constraint.

Note that we started our considerations by expressing the probability of an event via a path
integral. The final object we obtain though, namely the instanton, is interesting in its own right
in that it is exactly the most likely realization of the outcome we set out to observe, regardless
of whether it indeed represents the typical realization of that outcome. The crucial subtlety here

is that for a common event there are usually a multitude of possible histories for its creation,
while an extreme outlier event is usually driven by a very specific and reproducible chain of


events. The average field configuration realizing a moderate vorticity, say, will in general be very
different from its most likely configuration, and in fact is rather meaningless, as it averages over
many different and unrelated physical mechanisms. For extreme events, on the other hand, the
two notions coincide, and the most likely conditioned configuration precisely corresponds to the
conditioned field average.

The connection to Freidlin-Wentzell theory [7] and large deviation theory rare events
algorithms [8] allows us to make this notion rather precise: the large deviation limit in the set-
up that was outlined above is correct in the small noise limit. Through a suitable rescaling of (2.1),
this limit is, in the first instance, equivalent to the low Reynolds number limit for the NSE: non-
