their height is about four-ninths of their width. A strong circumsutural cord is followed
anteriorly by a shallow spiral groove, each occupying nearly one-fifth the height of the
whorl; anterior three-fifths or so of whorl surface slightly convex in outline. Sutures
evidently fine and linear. Circumsutural cord appearing to consist of a thick posterior
portion separated by a fine incised line from a narrow anterior portion, but this appearance
may be due to weathering. No other spiral ornament is preserved on the spire whorls.
Axial ornament consisting of numerous, sharp, closely spaced riblets which are of the
same width as, or slightly narrower than, their intervals, and are noticeably retrocurrent;
there are five in ? mm. on the penultimate whorl.

Body whorl with slightly to gently convex flanks, a gently excavated base, and a
moderately long and straight neck. The absence of any trace of a siphonal fasciole may be
due to the fact that the later whorls are missing. Indications of about ten spiral threads on
the neck. Aperture oval and, possibly due to breakage, apparently with a slightly oblique
anterior canal of about the same length as the height of the aperture. Outer lip broken.

~ Growth lines, while not clearly seen, generally prominent on the anterior part of the whorls,
and with a deep U-shaped sinus in the concave band.

Dimensions. Holotype: height (slightly incomplete) 6-6 mm.; width 2-25 mm.

' Remarks. This interesting form is unique among turrid forms described from the
Eocene of Pakistan, India and Burma in its ornament. The rather slender form and closely
spaced oblique and retrocurrent ribs relate it to the Neogene forms Drillia (Crassispira)
tittabweensis Vredenburg from the Obogon Alternations (Middle Miocene) of Kyaungon,
