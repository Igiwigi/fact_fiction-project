Gravettian hand stencils as sign language

Accepted: 24 January 2021

Subject Areas:

behaviour, cognition Plains Indians. In those groups, signing is used for hunting and for a rich
array of ritual purposes, including mourning and traditional story-telling.
Keywords: We discuss further evidence, based on typological generalizations about

the phonology of non-primary sign languages and comparative ethno-
graphic work, that points to such a parallelism. This evidence includes
the fact that for some of those groups, stencil and petroglyph art has
independently been linked to their sign language expressions.
