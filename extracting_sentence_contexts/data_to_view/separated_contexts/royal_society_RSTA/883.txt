Equivalence of graphs under local complementations has been studied by Bouchet in [10], which
was used by Van den Nest ef al. [11] to find an efficient algorithm to decide whether two graph
states are equivalent under single-qubit Clifford operations. The computational complexity of deciding if a graph G’ is a vertex-minor of G, and therefore
if |G’) is a qubit-minor of |G), was, to the authors’ knowledge, previously unknown. In another
paper [12], we show that this decision problem is, in fact, NP-Complete. There is, therefore, no
efficient algorithm that solves this question in general, unless P = NP.

(a) Results

Here, we show that the same problem can be solved in cubic time in the number of qubits of |G)
on instances where the Schmidt-rank width of |G) and the number of qubits of |G’) are bounded.! This is our first main result which we formally state in theorem 1.2 and prove in §5c.
