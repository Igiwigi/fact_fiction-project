Thus, after 4 to 5 hours’ withering, the stomatal transpiration was nearly four times
the loss from the cuticular surface ; and during the final 8 hours (after 21 hours of
withering) the stomatal loss still clearly preponderates.

§ 3. Toe Temporary OPENING oF THE STOMATA PRODUCED BY WITHERING.

The hygroscopic method has shown itself to be valuable in analysing the process
of withering, especially in revealing the interesting fact that in many plants the
closure of the stomata is preceded by a well-marked temporary opening. This fact
illustrates the dependence of the stomata on the pressure of the epidermic cells. It
has an important bearing on the general mechanism of the stomata, and is discussed
in a later section.

The following experiment shows the result.
