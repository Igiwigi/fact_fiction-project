The two or three smaller but functional premolars in advance of the large lower car-
nassial in the meso0zoic Plagiaulan are reduced to two more minute functionless and
speedily lost premolars in the neozoic Thylacoleo.

+ This well-known fact in comparative odontology is here repeated in reply to the question addressed by
Professor Huxrey to the London Geological Society : 4 in what circumstance is the Phascototherium more
embryonic, or of a more generalized type, than the modern Opossum ?”—Quarterly Journal of the Society, vol.
xviii, (1862) p, li. PROFESSOR OWEN ON THE FOSSIL MAMMALS OF AUSTRALIA. 257

This fact invalidates the averment of © the contradictory bearing of the dental system
of Plagiaulaz upon the assumption that the earliest; Mammals had the full complement
of teeth :” which averment Dr. FALCONBR reiterates and © calls special attention to,” in X.
p- 365, XI. p. 451. For if, in place of asxuming Plagiaulan to be the earliest mammal,
and, as 8uch, with the full complement of teeth, or © the oldest well-ascertained herbi-
vorous mammal,” it be viewed as no more than it is, viz. a gevlogically earlier form than
Thylacoleo with a dentition similarly modified for carniyority, the degree of difference
between the two members of the Paucidentata is affirmatory instead of contradictory.
in relation to the rule in question, rightly stated.
