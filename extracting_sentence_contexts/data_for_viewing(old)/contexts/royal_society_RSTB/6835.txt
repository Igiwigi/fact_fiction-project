higher to a lower virulence, and so far as has been observed they take place in one
direction only. The basis of a mutation probably lies in some relatively slight modifica-
tion of the original gene, possibly the loss of a radicle, or its replacement by another.
It is just such changes as may be suspected of being the underlying cause of change in
the virus particle. Of less moment, but of considerable interest, is the close similarity of
effect between the action of certain viruses and specific genes of which the enation strain
of tobacco mosaic on tomato and the shoe-lace genetic mutation in the same plant is an
example. Recent researches on the X and other viruses have shown that no hard and
fast line can be drawn between what we have been accustomed to regard as living as
opposed to non-living matter. All we may perhaps permit ourselves to say to-day is that
some viruses, like the X virus, are complex organic particles endowed with but a few of
the characters encountered in the simplest known living organisms. Such viruses fit into
neither of the accepted categories of the living and non-living. The facts are there: we
must adjust our concepts to them.

The writer desires to express his deep gratitude to his former colleague Mr F. C.
Bawden and to his present colleague Dr R. Dennis for the unstinted assistance they
have rendered him throughout the whole course of these investigations. It is not too
much to say that without their generous co-operation this work could not have been
brought to a conclusion.

SUMMARY

The X virus is a term which should be applied to a group of strains, rather than to a
single specific pathogen with fixed and constant reactions. It is shown that at least six
