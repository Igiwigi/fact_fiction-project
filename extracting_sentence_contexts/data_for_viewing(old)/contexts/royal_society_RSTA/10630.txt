Hence by (exviii.) we can easily find the frequency of population outside the
contours xk; and x, 3; if these be vp and v, we have :

vy = *000,000,163, vy = °000,000,000,015.

Thus the French population would have to be extended to a boundary in which only
about 1 in six millions was excluded, and the Aino population to a boundary excluding
only 15 in the billion! The boundaries of what we may thus term the selection
populations are far larger than our conventional boundaries of 1 in 1000 for represen-
tative populations. In fact, it would be impossible to select a representative Aino
population from a conventional representative French population and vice versa—in
either case the very exceptional members of French or Aino populations are
required to complete the conventional representative populations of Aino or French
by selection,

(15.) I have devoted most of my consideration of the surface of survivals to
a particular case in which two organs have been selected, and we consider the nature
of p which determines the fraction of each group of individuals which survives.
I have done this partly because normal surfaces are at best only an approximate
representation of our selectable and selected distributions, and partly because I have
thought a concrete case would best bring out the general points of investigations of
this kind.
