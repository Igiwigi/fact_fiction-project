The equations of motion for the
system so constrained are

(3.63) f=O+P,
where P” is the additional force vector introduced by the constraint, such that
(3.631) P39" =0

for all displacements 3” satisfying the equations of constraint (3.62). We wish to consider three trajectories in the manifold of configurations, all having
the same velocity vector at a point R (and therefore touching one another at that
point) :

(1) an arbitrary unnatural trajectory C, satisfying the conditions of constraint ;

(2) the constrained natural trajectory O* ;

(3) the free natural trajectory C**. We have, by (3.54), at the point R

(3.64) © 82*[« (C, O**)? = 27 an, (f" — Q") (f* — Q*) — (L = da")?
(3.641) 81" [« (O*, C**)} = 27 a,,, (f*" — Q") (f*" — Q"),

use being made of the facts that the law of energy (3.23) is satisfied for C* and that,
at R, T* is equal to 7. Now the equations of motion for C* are, as in (3.63)

(3.65) fr= e+ P,
and therefore, using (3.631),

(3.651) Ginn f *"3q" = Gan (Q” ; 1) 8q" ae mn” 3q";
