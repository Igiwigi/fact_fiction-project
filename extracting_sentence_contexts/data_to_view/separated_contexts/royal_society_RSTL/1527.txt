The nebulous matter in a cubical space of 10' will admit
of a condensation of two trillion and 208: thousand

Planetary nebulz have a rotatory motion on their axes, g19
The original eccentricity of the nebulous matter of a
nebula may be the physical cause of the rotatory

motion of celestial bodies, - - - 319

undergone great changes and much greater since

POSTSCRIPT. Tr will be seen that in this paper I have only considered the
nebulous part of the construction of the heavens, and have
taken a star for the limit of my researches. The rich collec-
tion of clusters of stars contained in the 6th, 7th, and 8th classes
of my Catalogues, and many of the Connozssance des Temps,
have as yet been left unnoticed.
