The general impression is that
the ionospheric structure at Troms6 is less definite and certainly more variable with
respect to time than is the case in South-East England. It is highly probable that the marked variability in the intensity and structure of
the echoes at Troms√© is to be associated with the magnetic activity which is rarely
absent in such latitudes. Support for this view is found in the fact that during
magnetic activity, when echoes were obtained, they were found to be of marked
variability and often did not fall into the usual category of Region E or Region F
echoes. In other words, magnetic activity was associated with an ionospheric
structure different from the normal configuration. Our ionospheric observations preceding and during the Polar Year led us to
recognize an outstanding difficulty in connexion with the interpretation of the results
obtained for Region F.
