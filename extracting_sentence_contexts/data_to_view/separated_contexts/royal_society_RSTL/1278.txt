From the quantity of carbonic acid formed by the combus-
tion of the carburetted inflammable gas, produced in the ope-
ration of the action of well burnt charcoal upon sulphur, it
may be. conceived to contain oxygene. This circumstance,
and the fact that no hydrate of sulphur or muriatic acid gas is
formed by the operation of oxymuriatic acid upon the liquor,
but common sulphur precipitated ; are in favour of the opi-
nion, that the sulphur in this liquor, contains less oxygene
than in its common state. This idea has likewise occurred to

* Five measures of the mixed gas, agitated with solution of potash, left a residuum

of 3.5. These were detonated with 5.5 of oxygene ; the whole diminution, was to 6,
of this residuum 2.5 appeared to be carbonic acid,
