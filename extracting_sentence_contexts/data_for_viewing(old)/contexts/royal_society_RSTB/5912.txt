cranium.”

“ The weights of the three brains are (i) 965 gm., (ii) (half) 425 gm., and (iii) 1097 gm.”

“ Indubitably, therefore, the weight of the Bushman brain is lower than that of any other living race
of Man as yet recorded.”

The weight of the brain examined by MarsHaut is given by him as probably not more than 872 gm.


6 J. L. SHELLSHEAR ON THE PRIMITIVE FEATURES OF THE CEREBRUM.

Despite these facts it seems improbable that this increase of thickness of the inner
table of the skull would make an appreciable difference to the form of the frontal lobe ;
and, making full allowance for cerebral shrinking incidental to old age, the form of the
brain should not be much affected. It is, however, a question worth investigating.

It is important that the age of suture union should be determined in primitive races
in order to ascertain whether there is a definite precocity of closure in association with
a definite and early final attainment of growth in the brain.

The Sulcal Pattern of the Brain.
The occipital region.—Fig. 6, Plate 2, is the photograph of the posterior aspect: of
the brain. This photograph, perhaps the most interesting of the series, was not
published by Marswaty. Fig. 7 is a line drawing reconstructed from this and the
