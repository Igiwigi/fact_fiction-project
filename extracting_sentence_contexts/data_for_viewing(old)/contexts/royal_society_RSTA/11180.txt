a small but finite phase.

(v.) Our analysis of these waves and of their singular points in the neighbourhood
of the oscillator appears to add something to Hertz’s discussion ; it is possible that
it may throw light on the difficulties which arise in connecting with some of his
interference experiments. It would seem to us that all interference experiments
ought to be made at distances greater than 6 to 7 (A/2z) from the centre of the
oscillator, roughly about a wave-length from the oscillator, whereas Herrz rather
terminated than started his experiments at this distance. At such distances the
phase curves are approximately parallel to their asymptotes.

Finally, we are not unaware of the physical difficulties attending experiments, at
such distances, and wish in conclusion to again emphasise the fact that our analysis
only applies to a theoretical type of oscillator. It is, however, the type for which
Hertz himself endeavoured to provide a mathematical investigation.
