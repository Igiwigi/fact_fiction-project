viewed monocularly [18].

Critically, without extra-retinal inputs related to head or
eye movements, the perceived depth-sign (i.e. near versus
far, relative to the plane of fixation) of motion parallax stimuli
can be ambiguous [18,21,22]. In Rogers & Grahamâ€™s [18] pio-
neering study, observers translated their head side to side
while maintaining visual fixation on a world-fixed target by
counter-rotating their eyes. Thus, in principle, signals related
to either head translation or eye rotation might have provided
the necessary extra-retinal inputs for perception of depth-
sign from motion parallax. It was later demonstrated that
eye movement signals, in fact, provide a sufficient input to
disambiguate depth-sign [23-25]. In one manipulation,
Nawrot [24] moved the fixation target with the head such
that no overt eye movements were required. Interestingly,
subjects perceived inverted depth-sign, consistent with the
action of a smooth eye movement command signal that
serves to cancel the translational vestibulo-ocular reflex
(tVOR). This clearly dissociates perception of depth-sign
from head translation. It was possible that retinal slip due
to imperfect eye movements might be used to infer depth-
sign, however, Naji & Freeman [25] demonstrated that this
was not the case. These and subsequent studies have demon-
strated clearly that smooth eye movement command signals
