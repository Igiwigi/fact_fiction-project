and if we take for granted the mutual dependence of the refracting and reflect-
ing forces, the preceding experiments will establish a variation in the law of
the refracting forces of different media.

In the undulatory system, the preceding facts may be explained by sup-
posing that the density or elasticity of the ether yaries near the surface of dif-
ferent bodies; a supposition in itself highly probable, and which has been
already adopted to explain the loss of part of an undulation in several of the
phenomena of interference. In such a case the reflection of the light will
commence at a line where the density or elasticity of the ether in the first
medium begins to change, and will continue till the ray has penetrated to that
part of the second medium where the density or elasticity of the ether is uni-
form. In this theory, therefore, the preceding facts may be regarded as prov-
ing the variable condition of the ether near the surfaces of bodies, and of
establishing the beautiful and sagacious deduction of Dr. Youns, that the part
of an undulation lost is a variable fraction depending on the nature of the
contiguous media.

II. We come now to consider the second class of phanomena, or the ex-
istence of periodical colours at the confines of certain media of the same and
of different refractive powers.

That the periods of colour arise, as in all similar phznomena, from the inter-
