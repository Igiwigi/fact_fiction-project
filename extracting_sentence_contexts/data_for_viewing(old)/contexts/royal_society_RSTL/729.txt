I have in a former Paper remarked, that the potatoe consists

of four distinct \substances, the epidermis, the true skin, the
bark, and its internal substance, which from its mode of forma-
tion, and subsequent office, I have supposed to be alburnous :
there is also in the young tubes a transparent line through the
center, which is probably its medulla. The buds and runners
sprang from the substance which I conceive to be the alburnum
of the root, and neither from the central part of it, nor from
the surface in contact with the bark. It must, however, be
admitted, that the internal substance of the potatoe corresponds
more nearly with our ideas of a medullary than of an albur-
nous 8ubstance, and therefore this, with the preceding facts, is

adduced to prove only that the reproduced buds of these

plants are not generated by the cortical substance of the root :

and I shall proceed to relate some experiments on the apple,
and pear, and plumb-tree, which I conceive to prove that the
reproduced buds of those plants do not spring from the
medulla.

Having raised from seeds a very considerable number of
plants of each of these species in 1802, I partly disengaged
