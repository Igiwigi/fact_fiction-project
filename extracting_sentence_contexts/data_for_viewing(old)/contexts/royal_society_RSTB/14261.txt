adjacent pars opercularis of the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG op).
In the lateral prefrontal cortex, significant connections were
restricted to a limited sector situated between the superior
and the middle frontal gyrus (SFG and MFG, respectively),
despite both SFG and MFG being extensively sampled in our
dataset. For all reported regions, CCEP responses were obtained
from at least two patients. The amygdala—which was explored
only in three patients—also showed CCEPs in 20% of contacts,
albeit results were obtained only from one patient.

The reason why some contacts/patients failed to show
CCEPs—including in regions with a high connectivity—
could be explained by the fact that the positions of the con-
tacts, despite being in the same area, are not exactly
overlapping in different subjects. Since the SEEG contact is
extremely limited in the recording volume, it could be ineffec-
tive to record a CCEP since it is a local field and not a far field.

To account for the possible under-sampling of some
specific regions (e.g. the amygdala, which is rarely implanted
in patients with implantations covering the anterior cingulate),
we compared our results with the Functional Brain Tractogra-
phy Project f-tract (https: //f-tract.eu/; [44,55]), reporting large-
scale human brain connectivity maps based on CCEPs
recorded from several hundreds of patients. While providing
