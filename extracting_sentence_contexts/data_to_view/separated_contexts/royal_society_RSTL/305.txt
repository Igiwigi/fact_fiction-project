I als
saw most distinctly the faint bluish luminous streak, sensibly
extending in an inflected direction beyond the bright semi-
circle, and continued observing it till -6* go'*, when, on ac-
count of the descent of the planet, I ceased my observation. The powers I used magnified 9g and 74, times. No doubt can hence be entertained of the reality of this
memorable phznomenon ; but for reasons which I shall give
hereafter, I was very solicitous to be able to measure the pro-

whether. in fact-/it,only belongs to the northern cusp. The very next, or the fourth evening, gave me a favourable
opportunity for this, purpose, and this was the more fortunate,
as, on account, of the hazy weather that immediately suc-
ceeded, of the increased twilight into which the planet ad-
vanced, and of its decreasing. declination, this was the last
evening in which such an observation could be made with
some precision, At six o'clock, the atmosphere being uncom-
monly clear, I looked at Venus with the seyen-feet reflector,
magnifying 95 and /74, times. It appeared very distinct, and I
ascertained,/ beyond the possibility of doubt, that the southern
cusp projected somewhat into. the dark hemisphere, and that
fromthe point of the northern one, the yery faint narrow
streak -of pale bluish light, intermittent in intensity on ac-
count of its faintness, but yet permanent as to duration, ex-
tended several degrees along the limb of the dark hemisphere
of the planet.
