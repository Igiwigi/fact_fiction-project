M. Tuore commences by objecting to my
having experimented in an enclosed space, saying that he always operates in free air. He thinks that enclosure may almost or quite suppress his force. To this I can reply
that I have myself verified nearly all M. THornâ€™s facts of rotation (including those
just now communicated) when working in the free air of a large room, and it was only
when I found the delicacy of the observations was impeded by draughts and currents
that I put screens round the apparatus. I have not found glass screens interfere
materially with any of the rotations, M. THorx now says that it is necessary to hold
the pillar or the exciting body in contact with the hand during the whole duration
of the experiment. I was not aware that importance was attached to this point,
but I have since repeated many of my former observations, holding the pillar in
the hand, The results are certainly stronger; but the extra heat imparted to the
apparatus is, in my opinion, sufficient to account for this, M. THore brings forward
many new and ingeniously devised experiments to prove that heat cannot be
considered the cause of the movement.
