Unfortunately, those which might have been useful cut down
the working radiation too much. For monochromatism the dispersion of the illumi-
nator has therefore alone been relied on. As a matter of fact, the lines were all sharp
and widely separated, and no trouble has been experienced, owing either to overlapping
or to stray light of other wave-lengths. The lamp was run at the maximum brightness
at which it could be depended on to run smoothly and remain constant. To prevent
trouble due to stray light it was necessary to enclose the lamp in a large tin box, and
to prevent over-heating a water-cooling system had to be provided.
