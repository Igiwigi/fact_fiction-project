the very few which require an expansion only very slightly exceeding this may be
charged and identical with those produced by Réntgen rays. Otherwise we have the
somewhat astonishing result that two quite different kinds of nuclei require absolutely
the same degree of supersaturation, that, namely, corresponding to the expansion
v,/v, = 1°25, in order that condensation should take place on them. To make experi-
ments of the same kind with expansions only slightly exceeding the limit v/v, = 1°25
is difficult on account of the exceedingly small number of the drops. Apparatus on a
much larger scale would be better for experiments on this point,

One way of accounting for the fact that an electric field has no effect on the rain-
like condensation under consideration would be to suppose that the nuclei are
produced at the moment of expansion. They might, for example, be caused by the
motion of the piston or plunger through the water. The fact, however, that the
condensation is just as easily observed when the cloud-vessel is connected with the
rest of the apparatus by a bent tube of considerable length, as for example in the
apparatus shown in fig. 2, shows that this is not the source of the nuclei.

The question whether the nuclei which exist in small numbers in moist air are

qgharged or not must, I think, be left an open one for the present. It is manifestly a
Snatter of considerable meteorological interest.
