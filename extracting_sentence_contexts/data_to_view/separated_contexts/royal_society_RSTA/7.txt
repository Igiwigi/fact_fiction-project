By the Hahn-Banach theorem, F o (j)~! may be


extended to an element S € C°(J!W)*. By the Riesz representation theorem, such an element S is a
measure which is valued in the dual of the jet bundle. If a different atlas had been chosen, the fact
that equivalent topologies would be induced on the spaces of sections implies that F o (j!)~1 is
still continuous. The construction is therefore independent of the choice of an atlas. It follows that

F=Soj! =j'*(S). (2.7)

We refer to S as a variational stress (measure).
