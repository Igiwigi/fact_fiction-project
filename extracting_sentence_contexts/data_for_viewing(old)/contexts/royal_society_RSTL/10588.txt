complex condition of the mixed herbage. It might be supposed that the reserve of
nitrogen to be rendered available under the influence of the mineral manure would be
greater during the 12 years 8ncceeding the application of an excess of ammonia-salts
than during the first 12 years of the application of the mineral manure on plot 7. The
great relative deficiency in yield of Leguminose under the influence of the 8ame manure
applied upon a residue of ammonia-salts would seem to be explicable, therefore, on the
gupposition that the Leguminose had been to a great extent really banished during
the 13 years' application of the ammonia-salts ; whilst at the commencement of the
experiment on plob 7 they were generally distributed, but of restricted growth, as
is common without manure, or when the grasses are not forced into prominence by
nitrogenous manures. That the deficient yield of Leguminose on plot 6 compared
with plot 7 is due to a want of plant, and not (as it cannot be) to a corresponding
deficiency of food material, is further rendered probable by the fact that, although the
actual amount in each complete or partial separation-year since the change of manure
on plot 6 is much less there than on plot 7, yet the amounts fluctuate somewhat
correspondingly on the two plots from year to year according to season.

80 much for the distinctions between the botany of plob 5 with the continuous
gupply of ammonia-salts, of plot 6 with ammonia-salts s8ncceeded by mineral manure,
and of plot 7 with the continuous supply of the same mineral manure from the com-
mencement., The figures in the table, and the foregoing comments, however, bring
to view very inadequately the very great differences between the herbage on the
respective plots. |

In the firs season of the change of manure the herbage on plot 6 acquired a totally
