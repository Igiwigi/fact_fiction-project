consider development of the underlying memory systems.

5. Development of memory systems

Although brain connectivity undergoes significant develop-
ment in the first year of life [71], key structures in the
hippocampus have a relatively extended developmental trajec-
tory. Parts of CA1 making up the monosynaptic circuit of the
hippocampus develop rapidly over the first 2 years of life, par-
ticularly those parts receiving input from cortical regions [72].
However, the portions of CA1 receiving projections from CA3
of the trisynaptic circuit of the hippocampus are relatively less
developed [72]. This fact is consistent with the slow develop-
ment of the trisynaptic circuit, which does not begin to
support fairly robust pattern separation until about 4 years of
age in human behaviour [73]. Development in non-human pri-
mates follows similar behavioural and neuroanatomical
trajectories adjusted for human age [72]. Although sharp-
wave ripples are one of the earliest oscillations to manifest in
development [74], Gomez & Edgin [75] argued that there
cannot be mature ASC until the projections from CA3 to CA1
are sufficiently developed for sharp-wave ripples originating
in CA3 to propagate to CA1. Although CA1 may propagate
some ripples to cortex during infancy, we would not expect
