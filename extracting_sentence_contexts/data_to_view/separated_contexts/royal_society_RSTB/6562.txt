h.es., p., as in fig 2. All dissection work to determine parasitism can, therefore, be dispensed with, so
that the material is admirably suited for any extensive qualitative and quantitative
studies. In actual fact, a count of the number of eggs deposited in any given case is
more reliable if based on an external examination for pedicels rather than dissections

of the host larvae, as the parasite eggs are often laid in organs such as the head capsule,
salivary glands, or prolegs, and are easily obscured and overlooked among the numerous
long hairs of the gipsy moth larva. Thus in a dissection of a typical sample of 150 hosts,
each with a single pedicel projecting through to the exterior, only 141 parasite eggs
were found, although the presence of part of the pedicel still adhering to the inside of
the egg-shell of the other nine was positive proof that an egg had been deposited. On hatching, the first instar larva does not become detached from the pedicel but
remains partly enveloped posteriorly by the cast egg-shell, part of which has a fine
reticulate structure (fig. 2).
