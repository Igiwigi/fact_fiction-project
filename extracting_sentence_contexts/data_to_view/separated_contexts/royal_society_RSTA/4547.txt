This comes to assuming that a gas molecule loses
potential energy when it enters the surface layer. To explain the results it is
necessary to assume, in addition, that, for reasons connected with the structure of the
metal, only dissociated oxygen atoms and not the ordinary molecules are capable of
entering the surface layer. This assumption receives some support from the fact
that the hydrogen which diffuses through hot platinum has been shown to be in the
atomic form. * In order to make the problem definite we shall suppose the surface
layer to be only a few atoms thick, and that each platinum atom is capable of
retaining one oxygen atom in its immediate neighbourhood.
