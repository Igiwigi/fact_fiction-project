strands, is probably not without significance. At a higher level the ascending strands
approach the gap and finally themselves occupy the gap. A section from a level
between the chalaza and the equator therefore gives the misleading impression that
all the strands in the ring belong to the same system. (See Srmes’s fig. 4, e, f, p. 471,
for P. macrophyllus, which will do equally well for the closely allied P. bracteata.)

TEXt-FIG. 39.—Podocarpus bracteata, BLUME. Transverse section of seed at a level midway between the
micropyle and the equator. The vascular bundles are shown solid black.

* Synonymous with P. neriifolius, Don.

t+ Ihave observed the same feature in one other (unidentified) species of Podocarpus (§ Eupodocarpus),
and consider it very probable that it occurs in several other species. The fact that StiLEs does not
figure or describe the phenomenon in P. macrophyllus, a species closely allied to P. bracteata, may be due to
his sections not having passed through the region to which this condition appears to be limited.


AFFINITIES OF ACMOPYLE PANCHERI, PILGER. 285

The conception of a cup-like vascular system pendent from the chalaza oceurred to
Favre (1865, p. 381) as early as 1865 from his study of Podocarpus chinensis, but,
so far as I am aware, no one has followed up his suggestive idea.

Tn homologising the vascular system of the female organs of Podocarpus with that
in Aemopyle, it must be recognised that what in Podocarpus is known as the “ ovular
