Applying DBP at the transmitter (sometimes termed as nonlinear
pre-distortion or transmitter-based pre-distortion) or at the receiver gives approximately the
same gains (determined by the accumulation of noise from the amplifier in the link) with one
fewer amplifier noise contribution in the transmitter-based DBP case [31,32]. In the case of long
transmission distances (greater than 10 spans), this difference is insignificant. In fact, it is clear
that to reduce the contribution of noise, DBP should be split in the ratio of 50% :50% between
the transmitter and receiver. However, the greatest increase in the effectiveness of DBP can be
achieved by reverse propagation of multiple channels, enabling the compensation of not only
SPM but also inter-channel nonlinearities (XPM) [33]. The gains offered by DBP are discussed in
detail in §§3, 4 and 5.

(b) Optical phase conjugation

It is possible, using nonlinear optical processes, to exactly reverse the phase of a beam of light.
