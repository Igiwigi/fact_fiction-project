C with B. Yet this will be the inevitable result under the one theory as well as
under the other. A mixture of single equiyalents of nitrate of baryta and sulphate
of potash may be taken as an illustration, Here, as has frequently been shown, if
BerTHOLLET's views be correct, at the firs: moment of mixing a portion of the baryta
combines with sulphuric acid, but that compound being insoluble is instantly put
ont of the field of action, and the resulting mixture really consists of nitrate of baryta,
nitrate of potasb, and sulphate of potash, which of course gives rise to a redistribu-
tion of the bases and acids, and a further production of insoluble sulphate of baryta,
and $0 on, till the amount of nitrate of baryta remaining is infinitesimally small ;
while at the same time the whole of the potash must necessarily combine with the
whole of the nitric acid. It is scarcely necessary to observe, that this division and
precipitation will take place continuously until complete; and that it may be $0
rapid as to elude our notice*. The fact then that precipitation when it occurs is
complete, decides nothing as to the relative merits of the two theories of elective
affinity. Yet there is an important difference to be noted. On BgrGman's suppo-
Sition, it can hardly be imagined but that cases will sometimes occur, where A has 80
strong an affinity for B, or C 80 powerful an attraction for D, that on mixing AB
and CD, no interchange will take place, although AD may be an insoluble body.
On BzrraoLLeT's Supposition, the insoluble compound will always be wholly precipi-
tated whenever by the interchange of acids and bases such a compound can be
formed, even though it be against the preponderating direction of the affinities. Now
this can be put. at once to the test of experience: and what is the testimony of the
thousands of double decompositions which chemists are in the habit of meeting with :
Granant says, Â© It is a general law to which there is no exception, that two soluble
salts cannot be mixed without the occurrence of decomposition, if one of the pro-
