The point P in fig. 3, shows the resulting
position of this diameter, and it will be seen that it almost coincides with the point
representing the normal to the 110 plane. Thus there is additional experimental evidence that the direction of slip was the 110
direction. (c) Stress Considerationsâ€”In view of the fact that the experimental evidence
indicates that the direction of slip coincides with one of the principal lines of atoms
in an octahedral plane, an analysis has been made of the shear stress throughout the
test in each of the three similar crystallographic directions on the four octahedral
planes. The results are given in Table VIII. It will be seen that the stress on the 111
plane in the direction of its intersection with the 111 plane (i.e., in the 110 direction)
was always greater than any of the other eleven components given, until the drawing-
down stage began, and therefore from stress-considerations if slipping of the nature
