the behaviour of the samples in question. They found that the results could readily
be duplicated, particular determinations being made at widely different periods.

As a result of their experiments Sroxes and Waser were led to define the ignition
point of an explosive substance as the lowest temperature at which a sample would
instantaneously burst into flame under conditions favourable to combustion. This
temperature was determined for the various substances in the following manner. Small
strips of the material were touched with a narrow porcelain tube containing a thermo-
couple, the tube being heated in an electric furnace, the temperature of which was
maintained at the temperature of the test. The experimental procedure consisted in
rapidly withdrawing the tube from the furnace and momentarily touching it with the
edge of the sample under test, the fact being noted whether the sample burst into
flame or not. The temperature of the furnace was then reduced and the samples
re-tested. In this way they arrived at a lower limit to the temperature of instantaneous
decomposition.

The observations of Sroxes and Weser for collodion cotton (nitrocellulose), smokeless

powder and black powder are shown in Table TV.
