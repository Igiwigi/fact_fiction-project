129. Monstrosity.—The only example of monstrosity which I have met with in this
type, is obviously analogous to the * monstrosities by excess ” which I have described as
not unfrequent in Orbitolites; consisting (at least apparently) in the formation of a
secondary body by outgrowth or gemmation from the first. This secondary body does
not seem, however, to have its origin in the primordial s8egment, to which similar out-
growths may always be traced in Orbitolites («| 62).

130. Afinities—As regards its general organization and plan of growth, it seems
clear that Peneroplis bears a very near approximation to that form of Orbiculing in
which the later increase takes place like the earlier upon the spiral type (© 8T), and in
which there is but a single plane of chambers with a single row of marginal pores (© 90):
the only essential difference, in fact, consisting in this, that each snccessive increment is
formed in the case of Peneroplis by a continuous segment of sarcode, occupying an undi-
vided chamber of the shell ; whilst in the case of Orbiculing each segment is subdivided
into sub-segments strung like the beads of a necklace on a continuous stolon of sarcode,
the chamber being correspondingly subdivided by transverse partitions having a con-
tinuous passage through all. The very close alliance of the two forms is shown by the
fact, that specimens are occasionally to be met with in collections of Orbiculine, which,
while presenting the general physiognomy of that genus, exhibit the deficiency of trans-
verse partitions which is the distinguishing character of Peneroplis; 80 as to render it
uncertain whether such specimens should be considered as Orbiculine in which (as
certainly happens occasionally in Orbitolites, | 61) the usual partitions are deficient, or
whether they truly belong to Peneroplis, their resemblance to Orbiculing being super-
ficial only, and their presence among specimens of that genus merely accidental. In
