This is especially the case with those occupying the centrw
parts of all longitudinal sections. "Towards the outer margins of the bundle in suc

Spiral vessels. The larger ones are invariably reticulated, and in passing along the sene

transverse sections of similar bundles, we find that the central line of each bundle 3

Immediately swrrounding the vascular bundle we have the innermost of the cortical
tissues (9), which varies much in thickness in different specimens. 'This is a delicate
parenchyma (9), the cells of which are from -002 to +0025 in diameter, and which are
disposed in interrupted vertical lines running parallel with the periphery of the bundle.
