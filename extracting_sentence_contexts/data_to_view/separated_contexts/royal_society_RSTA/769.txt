It is perhaps as well to state
which of the general results quoted apply to all crystals and which are of special
nature. The first point concerns the fall of the absorption on the short wave-length side
of the maximum. This effect depends only on the fact that the vibrational spectrum
of a crystal has a finite upper Timit, and that the spectrum of the combination tones
has a similar upper limit. Hence the effect should appear in all polar crystals. The existence of an absorption continuum is a result of the existence of a more
or less continuous vibrational spectrum, and is, as such, a general effect.
