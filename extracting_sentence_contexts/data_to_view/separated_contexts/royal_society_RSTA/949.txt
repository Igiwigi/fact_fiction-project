8. Examination in polarized light, under higher magnification, showed the typical
figure. The fact that many of these particles are arranged ina straight line is a charac-

produced little change. Heating for 1 hour at 300° C led to the appearance of
further crystalline aggregates, and probably to some increase in size of those already
