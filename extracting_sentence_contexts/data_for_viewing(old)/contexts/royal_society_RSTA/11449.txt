& whereas \ will tend to the limit zero.

S The analogue of the types of motion which correspond with the former roots will
still be oscillatory when the rotation is annulled, but the types of motion corre-
sponding with the roots of the second class will cease to exist as oscillations when
the angular velocity of rotation is reduced to zero. These types of motion will
have their equivalent in steady motions, but an infinitesimal amount of rotation
wouldâ€™ immediately convert such steady motions into oscillatory motions of very
long period.

For the particular case s = 0 the roots of the second class are all zero even
when the angular velocity of rotation is finite. Hence steady motions can exist
on a rotating globe, but these are necessarily of zonal type. We have in fact

already seen in Part I.* that the only forms of steady motion which can exist are of
this character, and have explained the fact by stating that the steady motions not
of zonal type which can exist on a globe without rotation must have their analogue
in the more general case in oscillatory motions whose period bears a finite ratio to
the rotation-period, no matter how great the latter may be. Our present work
confirms this statement and throws further light on the nature of these oscillatory

motions.
