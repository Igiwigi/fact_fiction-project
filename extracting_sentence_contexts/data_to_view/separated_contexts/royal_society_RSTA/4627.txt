30, this maximum temperature is 149° C., while
the lowest temperature found in the 8 per cent. alloy is 72°C. As the temperature
at which this recalescence occurs falls to this low point at a tin content of 8 per cent.,
it was at first supposed that the non-observation of the arrest in alloys of lower tin
content might be due to the fact that the temperature at which the recalescence
occurs had fallen down to or even below the ordinary temperature. To decide this
question, both heating- and cooling-curves of alloys containing 2 per cent. and 4 per
cent.
