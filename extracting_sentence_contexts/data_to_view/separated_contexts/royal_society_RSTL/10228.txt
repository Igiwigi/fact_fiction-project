Mrs, laboratory assistant at
Chris Church, in charging these tubes. IN GASES: HYDROGEN, CARBONIC OXIDE, AND OXYGEN. 633

Dr. B6rson* in a dissertation read at Tubingen has denied the fact (briefly
announced by me in 1880) that the absence of steam prevents the combination of
carbonie oxide and oxygen by the spark. He states that he has repeated the experi-
ment, and the mixture exploded, © eyen when dried by phosphoric oxide.” He found
that by sufficiently reducing the pressure he could prevent the propagation of the
explosion, both in the wet and dry gases. He snggests as an explanation of my regults
that the dry gases were tested under a less pressure than the wet gases.
