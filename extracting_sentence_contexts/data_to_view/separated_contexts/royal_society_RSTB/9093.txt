Most discussions of grammatical structure in
music and animal song are based on so-called positive data
(i.e. examples conforming with the proposed rules) and it is
significantly more difficult to establish the validity and exten-
sion of rules in the absence of negative data (i.e. where
humans or animals explicitly reject a malformed sequence). It is not clear whether ungrammatical/irregular structures
in music are clear-cut or distinguished in agreement by
non-expert or expert subjects. This difference between the lin-
guistic and the musical case may also in part be explained by
the fact that (at least in Western music), there is large diver-
gence between active and passive musical interaction. Furthermore, negative data are, particularly in the case of
animal research, more difficult to obtain and also less clear-
cut or potentially graded rather than binary. This issue motivates a number of changes in the nature of
models.
