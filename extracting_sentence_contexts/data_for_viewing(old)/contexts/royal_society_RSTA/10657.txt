For ‘calcium chloride a similar calculation gives the relation ¢

Such a large difference in the influence of concentration change on the actual velocities
of the two ions seems hardly to be expected.

It is also difficult to explain by any change in u and v the fact that if we consider
solutions up to 0°1 N of potassium nitrate and chloride and barium nitrate and
chloride, in the case of the three former no change in p occurs; whilst for the latter

* The conclusions of JAHN (‘ Zeitschrift fiir Phys. Chem.,’ 33, 545, 1900; 35, 1, 1900) point to the

fact that with increasing concentration, up to 55 the velocity of the ions increases in solutions of potassium,

sodium, and hydrogen chloride, the ratio of the velocities, however, remaining constant. (See also

it does ; this would mean, either that the Ba ion has its velocity diminished more
than the anion in solution of the chloride but not in the nitrate, or, that the NO, ion
is diminished in velocity in the barium salt, but not in the potassium salt. Further,
the variation in p for potassium sulphate points to the fact that the potassium ion is
