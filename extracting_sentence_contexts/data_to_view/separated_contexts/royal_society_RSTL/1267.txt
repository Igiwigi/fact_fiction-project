If any one has made the discovery on principle, he has
reasoned thus : cast steel in a welding heat is too soft to
bear being hammered; but is there no lower degree of heat in
which it may be soft enough to unite with iron, yet without

hazard of running under the hammer? A few experiments de-
cided the question ; for the fact is, that cast steel in a white
heat, and iron in a welding heat, unite completely. It must not be denied that considerable nicety is required in
giving a proper heat to the steel; for on applying it to the
iron it receives an increase of heat, and will sometimes run
on that increase, though it would have borne the hammer in
that state in which it was taken from the fire. I need scarcely observe, that when this process is intended,
the steel and iron must be heated separately, and the union
of the parts proposed to be joined effected at a single heat.
