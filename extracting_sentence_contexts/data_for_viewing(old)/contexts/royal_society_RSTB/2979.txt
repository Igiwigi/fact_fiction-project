towards the apex. The specimen U. C. L., R. 7, @ (not figured) is a section following
an almost identical plane (cf. text-fig. 1, p. 197).

Transverse sections near the base of the seed, such, for instance, as the lowest of
the series of three, 8. 236 (fig. 3) and U. C. L., R. 8, a (phot. 13), show the chalazal
cushion as an annular zone of transversely cut fibres with the supply bundle (v.b.)
occupying the centre. Around the cushion is a gap bridged at places by the shreds
of looser tissue, whilst peripherally the seed is closed in by the hypoderm and
palisade layer. The multi-seriate appearance of the last-named is an obvious
consequence of the almost tangential plane in which the testa is cut.

The eccentricity of the several zones in both these sections depends, of course, on
the fact that the plane of section is not truly transverse (cf. text-fig. 1). In this
part of the seed even very slight changes in the angle of cutting lead to marked
alterations in the distribution of the various zones.

Overlying the sclerotic cushion is a somewhat concave plate (W. 1930, and
U.C.L., R. 3, a, fig. 5 and phot. 9, nw.) forming the-bed upon which the base of the
intermediate sack rests. It is loosely compacted of thick-walled oval cells, whose
longer axes usually run in the radial direction, Thus, in the specimens U, C. L., R. 4
and R. 3, a (fig. 26 and phot. 9), these elements are cut nearly transversely in the
middle parts of the section, in the Lille specimen 1110 (fig. 27, nu.) almost
longitudinally.

Peripherally the edges of the bed or plate bend up and become continuous with
