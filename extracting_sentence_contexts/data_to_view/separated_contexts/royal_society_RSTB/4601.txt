These are associations of reduced or unreduced, com-
pressed or uncompressed, plates which are usually, and always primitively, grouped
around, and bound together by, one or more large tubercles. Simple “ growth-
pressure” may cause the resorption and modification of stereom to almost any extent,
but seems not to affect the thickness of interstitial sutural tissue. Indeed, if this
organic film is instrumental in the growth of the plates (an undoubted fact), it will
also be employed as an agent of resorption, and so must be maintained if the plates
are undergoing’that process. In compounds this placogenous membrane becomes so
attenuated that the stereom of contiguous components is practically continuous. Indeed, near the peristome, all traces of sutures are often destroyed, a development
analogous to “ syzygy” uniting the compounds into apparently homogeneous plates.
