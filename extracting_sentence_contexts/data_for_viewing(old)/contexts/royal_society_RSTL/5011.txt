I have already lamented that my opportunities of examining the Holothuridan Echi-
noderms, in the living state, have been few, Several points of surpassing interest, as
the climax and triumph too of the preceding inquiries, in the anatomy of these genera
demand scrupulons revision. Ist. Does the water admitted into the © respiratory
tree” serve to atrate the blood-proper or the chylaqueous fluid? This question can
only be answered by first determining the exact situation of the blood-vessels in rela-
tion to the parietes of this unprecedented organ. 2nd. Are the tentacles the scene
ofa double respiratory process, by which the blood-proper and the chylaqueous fluid
are atrated simultaneously? Analogy renders it certain that the integuments of these
genera, like the Sipunculidans, are * fenestrated,” and that with express view to the
a&ration of the contents of the visceral cavity. These inquiries have thas placed in
clear light the interesting fact, that there prevails but one essential type or plan of Struc-
ture in the integumentary system of all Echinoderms, and that the blood-proper may
have its own respiratory apparatus, or that it may be atrated through the medium of
or by the chylaqueous fluid, itse{f having first received oxygen from the surrounding
element.

The Entozoa constitute, really, the true commencement of the Annelida in the
rest. At present I will only commit myself to the statement, that in the fluid of the peritoneal cavity of the
Sipunculidz the germ-cell-like bodies are veritable ova, and the sperm-cells are veritable spermatozoa.
