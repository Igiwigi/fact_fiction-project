The pattern in older
age groups is somewhat more complex; group 40-44 was found to reduce contacts relative to C°
the most, but interestingly relative rates go up again until the 55-59 age group before reducing
for older individuals. It should be noted that, in contrast to other age groups, absence of data
on pre-pandemic contact rates for care home residents means the estimate for vcy (figure 32)
should not be interpreted as an increase in contact rate. Rather, it is simply a reflection of the fact
that contact rates in care homes are much higher than the rest of the population”! (due to being
communal environments with frequent contacts between residents and staff), which has led to
a disproportionate number of cases, and sadly deaths, compared with the elderly in the general
population. Time variation in the reproduction number: figure 4a shows the posterior distribution for

material, appendix O, and [31]). As shown in equation (2.3), this is a proxy for the overall effective
contact rate in the population.
