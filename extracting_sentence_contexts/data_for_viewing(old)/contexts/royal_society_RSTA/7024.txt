greatest if we work in the region of very soft X-rays, say from 40 to 500 A. In this
region, it has been found that the X-ray levels are often sharp to within ;'5 eV or even
less, and there is every reason to believe that this is adequate for the resolution of all
the features which exist in the N(/) curve. In the region of shorter wave-lengths,
the resolution is less good, though useful work can be performed on spectra down to
5 A, or perhaps even farther. A fuller discussion of the use of X-ray spectra in order
to determine the level system of the valence electron in a solid is to be found in a recent
article (Skinner 1939).

The investigation of the spectra of light elements of the first two groups of the
periodic table lies in the foreground of our problem. This is mainly because, for
technical reasons, these substances show the spectra which are most suitable for
detailed interpretation; in fact, the resolution is greatest. Further, in the first instance,
it is better to confine attention to solids made up of single elements; since, although
work has been done on chemical compounds, the general interpretation is naturally
likely to be more difficult. Therefore, in this first paper, we shall only deal with the
element metals and element insulators of the first two groups.

It is true that considerable work has already been done on the soft X-ray emission
and absorption bands of these substances. The K-emission bands of elements Li to C
in solid form, and the L,,-emission bands of Na to Si (lying in the range 40-400 A)
were investigated by Siegbahn and Magnusson (1934, 1935) and by Oâ€™Bryan and
Skinner (1934). The K-absorption bands of Li and the Z,,-absorption bands of Mg
were investigated in detail by Skinner and Johnston (#937), and recently the L,,-
absorption band of Al has been added by Johnston (1939). The distinction between
