greater than 7.

In considering the P-functions it was immaterial whether or not we regarded them
as vanishing, because P’ vanishes if ¢ is greater than 7 But the Q-functions do not
vanish in this case, and therefore we must postulate the existence of q’s with suffix
greater than 2.

In fact, whilst we have as before, when 7 and s are both odd or both even,

ay Py
Ui-. —8+ Bo’
we also have
ine +h. sop 1
Bo Gi (4 2 — s? spr Lala fii + 9) (2s)
and similarly a fraction for aus * and so forth.

It follows therefore that while the q’s with suffixes less than or equal to 7 depend
on finite continued fractions, those with suffixes greater than 7 depend on infinite
continued fractions.
