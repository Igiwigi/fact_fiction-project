from the general principles on which the phenomena were
capable of being explained, that the new methods of investi-
gation promised to lead to a more intimate knowledge than
had hitherto been obtained, concerning the true elements of
bodies.

2 Mr. Davy's Lecture on the Decomposition and Composition

This conjecture, then sanctioned only by strong analogies,
I am now happy to be able to support by some conclusive
facts. In the course of a laborious experimental application
of the powers of electro-chemical analysis, to bodies which
have appeared simple when examined by common chemical
agents, or which at least have never been decomposed, it has
been my good fortune to obtain new and singular results.

Such of 'the' series ' of experiments as are in a tolerably
mature state; and capable of being arranged in a connected
order, I shall detail in the following 'sections, particularly
those which demonstrate the decomposition and composition
of the fixed alkalies; and the production of the new and ex-
traordinary bodies which constitute their bases.
