Histologically
it is remarkable for differentiation into—(1) an inner region of thin-walled aqueous
tissue, on either side of the ovule, continued over the narrow diameter of the ovule
as an aqueous epidermis only, and just covering the nucellar region ; (2) a production
of peculiar, wavy, wandering fibres, with cellulose walls, which ultimately contribute
the greater part of the tough papery wing of the seed ; (8) a membranous peripheral
region of small, undifferentiated tissue, mainly epidermis only. ‘Two teeth, diverging
in the ripe seed as prominent horns,* obvious to the eye, apparently exaggerate the
lobing of the aperture of the envelope ; but such irregular teeth, more especially in
the form of two lateral lobes, are in no way suggestive of definite perianth-members
in the transverse plane of the diagram (cf. Lignrer and Tison, 1912, Whorl III). Two lateral bundles run up to the apex of this outer investment, just outside the
aqueous inner zone, to supply the comparatively large mass of tangentially extended
tissue in the most direct manner, and Lignier and Tison (1912, p. 143) naturally
regard them as confirmatory evidence of two component members, and, in fact, the
homologue of two stamen-traces.t On the other hand, SyKes (1910) prefers to trace
an analogy with the cupule of Lagenostoma !

* In the adult seed the cells in this region share in the general tendency to fibrous elongation, and the
“lip” processes are thus extended as slender wisps of fibrous cells and may attain a length of 5 mm.
(fig. 9).

+ In the adult seed six bundles pass up the neck of the perianth-region. These have a symmetrical
orientation, recalling that of the six filaments of the andreecial whorl (fig. 9). VOL.
