4 In those hardened in osmic acid, though the mutual relations of the masses of cells

Â© are very clear, yet it is difficult to distinguish the outlines of the individual cells.

S In the chromic-acid specimens (fig. C) the cells of these rudiments appear rounded,

S and each of them contains a large nucleus.

A I have been unable to prepare longitudinal sections of this stage, either horizontal or
vertical, to show satisfactorily the extreme summit. of the spinal cord; but I would
call attention to the fact that the cells forming the proximal portion of the outgrowth
are 8een in every transverse section at, this stage, and therefore exist the whole way
along, whereas the distat portion is seen only in every third or fourth section, according
to the thickness of the sections. Tt may be concluded from this that there appears a con-
tinuous outgrowth from the spinal canal, from which discontinuous processes grow out.

In specimens of a very much later period (Plate 18. fig. L) the proximal portions of the
outgrowth are unquestionably continuous with each other, though their actual junctions
with the spinal cord are very limited in extent. The fact of this continuity at a later
period is strongly in fayour of the view that the posterior branches of the spinal neryes
