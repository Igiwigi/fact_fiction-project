In these points (to which Mr. Krpston
first called my attention) Sigillariostrobus ciliatus differs entirely from Spencerites,
and apparently from Sigillariostrobus Crepini also. In the face of these facts it is impossible to unite Spencerites with Sigillariostrobus,
any more than with Lepidostrobus; our two species are best regarded as the repre-
sentatives of a distinct Lycopodiaceous genus. This conclusion leaves us in doubt as to the true nature of M. Zeriierâ€™s Sigil-
lariostrobus Crepini.
