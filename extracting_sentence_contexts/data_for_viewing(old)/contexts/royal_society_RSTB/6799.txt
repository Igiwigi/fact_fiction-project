chlorosis on the younger leaves. Notwithstanding the absence of symptoms, the virus,
unchanged in character, is still present.

The growth of an X°-infected tobacco plant is much hampered, compared with one
infected with the ZL, and still more with one infected with the G strain. The leaf area
during the first 2 months is probably less than one-quarter of the latter and about
one-third that of one infected with the L strain.

It is an interesting fact that old tobacco plants infected with the L strain frequently
display a more chlorotic mottle than do those which harbour the more virulent S
strain. In fact the character of the strain cannot be gauged by the clinical appearance
of the plants which harbour it after a stay of 2-3 months in the glasshouse.

On Datura. The S' strain differs in its reaction from that produced by either X° or
X* by invariably producing local lesions which are often very severe and may in young
tender plants occasionally coalesce and destroy the major parts of the inoculated leaf.
The systemic reaction in the older plants is similar to that called forth by the Z strain,
only more severe. In young seedlings it may induce large areas of necrosis which bring
about the collapse of the leaf (fig. 35, Plate 22).

In potatoes. In both President and Arran Victory the X°% strain produces an inter-
