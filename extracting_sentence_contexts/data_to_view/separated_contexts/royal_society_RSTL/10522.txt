Spushed (as we venture to think we have pushed it) beyond the point where he and

AN DER MENSBRUGGHE left ib, but the fact that it has led to a negative result does

Auxoful discussion if we suggest a cause which might, we think, furnish a satisfactory

lation of the difficulty.

an external force, is always separated from the rest of the film by a clearly defined
boundary.
