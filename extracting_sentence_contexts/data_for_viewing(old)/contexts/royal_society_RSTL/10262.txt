wall of the duodenum, immediately behind the level of the opening of the bile
From the apex of this funnel numerous small glandular tubuli s0on sprout, out,

The similarity in the development of the pancreas in Lepidosteus to that of
same gland in Elagmobranchii is very striking.* J

The pancreas at a later stage is placed immediately behind the end of the liver
a loop formed by the pylorie section of the stomach (Plate 27, fig. 62, p.). ny
larval life it constitutes a considerable gland, the anterior end of which partly envelopes
the bile duct (Plate 27, fig. 68, p.). 4

Considering the undoubted affinities between Lepidosteus and the Teleostei, the
facts just recorded with reference to the pancreas appear to us to demonstrate that
the small s8ize and occasional absence (?) of this gland in Teleostei is a result of the
degeneration of this gland ; and it seems probable that the pancreas will be found
in the larye of mos Teleostei. These conclusions render intelligible, moreover, the
great development of the pancreas in the Elasmobranchii,

We have firsb noticed the pyloric caca arising as outgrowths of the duodenum in
larvez of about three weeks old, and they become rapidly louger and more prominent
(Plate 27, fig. 62, c.). 7

The portion of the intestine behind the vitelline duct is, as in all the Vertebrata, at
first straight. In Elasmobranchs the lumen of the part of the intestine in which a
spiral valve is present in the adult, very early acquires a more or less semilunar form
