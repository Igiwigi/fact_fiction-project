the squamosal, hitherto unrecognised, which extends downwards and forwards
between the quadrate and pterygoid, and, together with a process arising from the
posterior border of the squamosal, embraces the otic head of the quadrate.” This
description would apply equally well to Ichthyosaurus and to Dicynodon,

The inner side of the descending process of the squamosal is also in contact, near
its origin, with the upper end of the opisthotic.

The Supratemporal.—tThis bone, as is so commonly the case with Ichthyosaurus
skulls, is missing. When present its relation to the adjacent bones is precisely that
of the outer bone in the Lizards which is called squamosal by Huxtey, Parker, and
others. The subject has lately been treated by Watson,} who argues that it is the
inner bone, called supratemporal by Huxiry and Parxer, which is in fact the
squamosal ; and the evidence for this seems to me overwhelming. But when WarTson
proceeds to identify the outer bone with the quadrato-jugal, I think he is on less
certain ground. The reason alleged is that “no other bone ever lies outside
the squamosal,” with the remark in a footnote, “except perhaps in Ichthyosaurus.”
The exception, however, is not doubtful. The supratemporal of this reptile is indeed
overlapped by the process of the squamosal, which goes to meet the postfrontal ;
but this process is absent from the Lizards, and it is the inner process of the
squamosal which joins the parietal that must be brought into comparison, and there
can be no question about this, The supratemporal lies a long way outside it. I
think therefore that Huxtey and Parker have simply inverted the names
appropriate to these two bones.
