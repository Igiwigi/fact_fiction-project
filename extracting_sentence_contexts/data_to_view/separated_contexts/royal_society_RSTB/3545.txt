A single neurofibril* runs, in a spiral course, in each
tube ; the central tube, although the largest, contains the most delicate fibril. He is
unable to confirm ApATHy’s statement that there are several fibrillee in each tube,
some coarse and others fine. He states that the fibrille in the giant tubes are much
thinner than those of the majority of the commissural and motor axones, a fact
which probably explains why those who have investigated these tubes by means of
the methods of Goner and Exruice have doubted their nervous nature. Krawany’s recent researches (1905) on the nervous system of the earthworm do
not add much to our knowledge of the giant fibres. He states that in many places
a fibril is very clearly differentiated from the more feebly stained envelope, that
anastomoses between the giant fibres occur in each ganglion, and that branches are
given off.
