These simulations established the emission as resulting from the 3
coherent interaction of the ionized electron with its parent ion—a ‘re-collision’ process. The cut- 1S
off relation was soon after elegantly derived using a classical trajectory model that refined the : S
cut-off relationship to Mv cut-off = Ip +3-17 Up [77], and followed by a full semiclassical theory in : 3

the strong-field approximation, which has been broadly applied and expanded-upon [78]. The
HHG process is essentially a coherent version of the Roentgen X-ray tube, generating high-energy
photons as a result of a high-energy electron-atom collision, and relying on the fact that during the
ionization process, the electron-ion ensemble remains an isolated, coherent quantum system. The
strong electric field of a laser ionizes an electron, pulls it away from its parent ion and then slams

it back. The ionizing electron wavefunction reacts deterministically to the applied field, so that :3
the high-frequency dipole emission; i.e. the high-harmonic emission—is also deterministic, with : =
the emission from a large number of phased emitters resulting in a coherent beam.
