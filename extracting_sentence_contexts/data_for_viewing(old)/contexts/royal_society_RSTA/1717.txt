Proposition 4.1. There exists an admissible control operator B € L(X,(Ep)—1) for Q such that
i
Bi2z(-) =| S_i(t — s)Bz(s)ds,  t>0. (4.4)
0

In addition, the operator B satisfies

R(A, Q_1)Bx =e* U(,0)x, AE p(Q), xEX. (4.5)


Proof. Let t>0 and ze LP(Rt,X). The fact that ||U(z,0)|| <Mel¢! for any t <0, and some
constants M>1 and w€R, imply that ;:E,— X is linear bounded for any t> 0. Let us now
prove that for any t,o > 0 we have

Pr402(-) = S() oz + $iz(- +0). (4.6)
In fact, using the same calculus as in [48], for t,o > 0, and t < 0 we have

~ U(t,0)z(t +t+o0), t+t<0,tT+t+oa0 20
