with precisely similar results. I opened the body of a female with great care (after
dividing the spinal cord through the medulla oblongata), for the purpose of ob-
taining ova from the oviducts, for artificial impregnation, and immediately saw that
a number of ova were free in the cavity of the abdomen, and were in the course of
being transferred to the entrance of the tubes, as stated in the first part of this paper.
These ova, like those which had recently escaped from the ovarium in the Frog, were
without any other covering than their vitelline membranes ; most certainly. I was
unable to detect any other, and they were so delicate that it was with difficulty they
were removed into water to which fluid from the male had been added. But
although uninjured in the removal, and in every way carefully treated, not one gave
any sign of cleavage of the yelk, which, as I have before stated, I have constantly
found take place in the impregnated ova of newts as well as of frogs, although the
fact of its occurrence was overlooked by Ruscon1; not one egg afterwards produced
the embryo. Thus then it seems fair to conclude that the egg in the Amphibia is
not fitted for impregnation until after it has entered the oviduct and acquired its
gelatinous covering.

I have already shown that there is a remarkable coincidence between the rate of
expansion of the gelatinous covering, immediately after the egg is placed in water,
and the susceptibility of the egg to become impregnated; and that in proportion as
the covering becomes enlarged and distended by imbibition of water, the snsceptibi-
lity of the egg becomes diminished ; until at the end of about half an hour it is
almost completely lost, at which time the rate of expansion of the envelope is also
greatly lessened, and the envelope itself has attained to more than two-thirds its future
diameter. Now SPALLANZAN1 found that the susceptibility of the ovum, when im-
