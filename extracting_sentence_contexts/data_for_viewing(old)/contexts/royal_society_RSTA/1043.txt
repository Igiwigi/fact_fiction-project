Remark 5.3. Given an initial stress tensor, this theorem implies that there exists a tensor 6s x)
that locally maps the body to an unstressed state. Such a distortion is not unique in general: if Q
belongs to the material symmetry group of w, then also T(6s(x)Q; £(X)) =0.

Remark 5.4. The collection of local maps
@ZN(X) = G(x,

which transform each point of the reference configuration into a point in the local unstressed
virtual state, is such that G[] € B(Qo,D), where B(829, PD) denotes the set of all bounded functions
f :29 > D. Moreover, the tensor map 6[Z] may not be geometrically compatible, i.e. there could
not exist any differentiable vector field gg such that Grad gg = @[Z]. In this case, there does not
exist a deformation that maps the reference configuration of the residually stressed material
into a relaxed one. In fact, assuming that the reference configuration is simply connected, such
a deformation exists if and only if
rot 6[Z] =0.

In the following, we call G[Z] the relaxing map.

Remark 5.5. By simple application of the mean stress theorem [60], in the absence of surface
tractions and body forces we obtain
