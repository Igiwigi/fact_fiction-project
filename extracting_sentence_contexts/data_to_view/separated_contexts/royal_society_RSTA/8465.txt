With regard to the lines showing the Stark effect, this attribute appears to bear no
relation to any of the other methods of classification, but attention may be drawn to
lines at 424185-4, 4123-9, 4021-7, 3927-3 and 3846-0, which are described as showing
the Stark effect, but which do not appear on any of our plates. If these lines are indeed
Hydrogen lines, it is possible that they make their appearance only in the powerful
electric fields which are necessary for the investigation of the Stark effect.

(6) Comparison of the Secondary Hydrogen Spectrum with the Solar Spectrum. The presence of lines of the secondary Hydrogen spectrum in celestial spectra has not
been established, but in view of the fact that we have separated the secondary spectrum
into groups, which vary in intensity under different physical conditions, we have made
a careful comparison of a number of secondary lines with RowLanv’s solar wave-lengths,
and with the sun-spot lines recorded by Hane and Apams (‘ Astrophys. Journ.,’ vol. 23,
p- 11, 1906). The most prominent lines of each class amongst the secondary lines were
selected and were reduced from International Units to RowLANv’s scale of wave-lengths.
