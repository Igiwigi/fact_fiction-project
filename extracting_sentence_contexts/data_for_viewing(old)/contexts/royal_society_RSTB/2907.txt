Previous Work on the Subject.

Some of the earliest work done on the pharmacological action of Cobra venom was
that by Lauper Brunton and Fayrer,* published about thirty years ago. They
considered that Cobra venom selected the cerebro-spinal nerve centres for its seat of
action ; it paralysed these, and in large doses it acted also on the ganglia of the heart,
causing arrest of cardiac action. They laid little stress on the rdle played by
circulatory failure, and in support of their views they quoted a number of experiments
in which cardiac pulsations continued after the apparent death of the animal. In
volume 22 they go on to discuss the subject still further. With the facts at their
disposal they were unable to come to any definite conclusion as to the exact influence
of the venom on the heart, but they thought that the heart’s arrest in systole, which
they at times observed was due to “some action on the cardiac ganglia.” They drew
attention to the great difference observed in the effect of venom according as it was
applied to the surface or to the interior of the heart. In this connection they quote
an experiment in which they perfused the frog-heart with a solution of Cobra venom,
and obtained arrest of it in a position midway between systole and diastole. The
strength of solution used is not stated and details are wanting, but the experiment
is of great interest, as it is the only record I can find in any writer's works of an
attempt to perfuse an isolated part with Cobra venom. They thought the action was
due to an influence on the cardiac ganglia. They found that in large doses Cobra
venom destroyed the inhibitory power of the vagus, which it did not do in small
