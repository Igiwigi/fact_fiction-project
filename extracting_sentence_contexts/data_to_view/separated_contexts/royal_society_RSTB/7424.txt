The total pyronin cells did also,
mainly through the effect of the mature cells. This means (it was seen) that the mature
and total plasma-cell infiltration of these grafts is characteristic of the host animalâ€”at any
rate over the period of the observations which was from the time when graft destruction
was moderate in extent. That this cellular infiltration is not related to the speed of graft
breakdown is suggested by the fact that the ranking of the animals in the order of the
speed of breakdown of their grafts was different for first-set and second-set grafts.

(3) In two animals (304 and 308) the speed of breakdown of the first and second set
of grafts was practically identical (see table 4). Yet the concentration of pyronin cells in
three out of the four comparisons (8 and 12 days for each) is considerably greater in the
second sets. This superiority holds for the immature and mature pyronin cells alike, and
especially for the proportion of pyronin cells to lymphocytes (since lymphocytes are
correspondingly lower in the second sets, the total cells being remarkably even).
