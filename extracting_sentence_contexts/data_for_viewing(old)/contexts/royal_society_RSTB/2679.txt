During the sojourn of the larve in the larger culture jars this “ echinus-rudiment ”
continually increases in size till it oceupies the whole left side of the larva, and then
metamorphosis occurs. If from any cause, such as neglect to add sufficient fresh
sea-water to the culture jars, there is an insufficient supply of food, the echinus-
rudiment ceases to develop, and may even become entirely absorbed without the
larve showing any other sign of unhealthiness. It may even show on the right.
side the pedicellarize and spines belonging to the aboral surface of the adult, whilst
on the left no trace of tentacles or spines can be seen.

Tt will readily oceur to the reader that it would have been a better plan to have
selected a certain number of blastule or very young echinoplutei, and have trans-
ferred them at once to the larger culture jars. As a matter of fact this plan was
tried, but it resulted in failure, as nearly all the larvee died. The explanation of this
curious fact which suggests itself to me is, that the hardiest larvee can only be
selected by subjecting them to a fairly severe struggle for existence during the first
weeks of their existence. The survivors of this struggle are then exceptionally
vigorous individuals, and capable of undergoing their further development without
further trouble. This idea is confirmed by the observation that some of the hardiest
larve were obtained from a culture in which, owing to the overcrowding of the eggs
in the dish in which fertilisation was effected, only about one-tenth of the number
developed.

The foregoing observations suggest that the great difficulty in rearing the larvee
is not the supply of oxygen, but the supply of food. In 1898 when unicellular
