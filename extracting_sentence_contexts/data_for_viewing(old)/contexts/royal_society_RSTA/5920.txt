flux densities, this fact emerges from the adiabatic decomposition, where the main contributions
to the flux are represented by the ground state elements.

Finally, in figure 82,b, we show the probability and translational probability densities for the
electronic case. They excellently reproduce the functions derived from the coupled calculation,
see figure 3. On the other hand, the electronic flux density vanishes within the BO approximation,
as is discussed in §2c. This, however, is not true for the translational flux density and, in fact, it is
nearly identical to the numerically exact one (compare with figure 3). As an important point, this
means that an electronic flux density is accessible via a BO calculation. This fact is not restricted to
the one-dimensional case as is the construction of the electronic flux density from the continuity
equation.

5. Conclusion

We study the dynamics of coupled electron—nuclear motion where the focus is on the nuclear
and electronic flux densities. A one-dimensional model is used where the interaction of a single
electron and a nucleus is parametrized such that the BO approximation holds. Using the adiabatic
expansion of the total wave functions, the numerically exact flux densities can be resolved into
various components. Under the regarded conditions, the nuclear flux density is dominated by a
