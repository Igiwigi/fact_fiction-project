We also give the
results as calculated by Muaxins and Davis, 7.Â¢. on the basis of the A and B
points (fig. 24). These naturally give a greater minute-volume throughout and show
a trifling rise in the minute-volume at Cerro, but they agree in the main with other
methods in the following respects. Rough as the methods are, one or two facts
emerge. A very trifling amount of exercise on the bicycle ergometer raises the blood
flow between 100 to 800 per cent. No change of this order takes place as the result of
residence at high altitudes, if one seeks for a change approaching one-tenth of this
order, namely 20-30 per cent., one just reaches the point at which the discrepancies
as between one method and another loom very large.
