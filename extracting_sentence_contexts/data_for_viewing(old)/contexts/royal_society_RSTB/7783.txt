the bulk of the calcite had crystallized out. The most plausible explanation is that there
was a local fall in pH as calcite came out of solution. If the fall was from about 8 to 7-5 or
thereabouts the precipitation of pyrite would be favoured (Krumbein & Garrels 1952).

(d) Conditions of deposition

(1) Origin of the microlamination

The presence of abundant carbonaceous matter in a sediment signifies anaerobic
conditions usually, since otherwise it would be oxidized and the carbon lost as CO).
Fine, undisturbed lamination signifies that no organisms burrowed within the sediment.
Nor did macro-organisms crawl about on the surface, since even this would suffice to
destroy laminae less than 1 mm thick. These facts are well known and bituminous shales
like those of Dorset are sometimes referred to as euxinic deposits. On the other hand, the
absence of lamination in fine-grained sediments is clear evidence that material has been
reworked by burrowing animals (Dapples 1942; Schafer 1956). In the case of the Blue
Lias the interpretation is straightforward, for the normal limestones and marls usually
contain ample evidence of organisms, both as body and trace-fossils. Clearly, they were
laid down in an aerobic environment. It should be observed that the presence of pyrite
in the non-laminated rocks in no way invalidates this interpretation, which involves the
bottom waters, since anaerobic conditions develop within nearly all fine-grained sediments
(ZoBell 1946). Significantly, only below the bituminous shales and laminated limestones
and marls is mottling due to trace-fossils absent. It is apparent that the rhythmic alterna-
tion of anaerobic with aerobic deposits (except for the few laminated limestones and
marls) is of considerable significance for palaeogeographical interpretations.
