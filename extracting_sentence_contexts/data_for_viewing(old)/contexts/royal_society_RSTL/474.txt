they are founded.

Muriatic acid is for us a simple body; but it has acid pro-
perties of the strongest kin4 ; therefore, from analogy, we
suppose it to contain oxygen. But may not this be too hasty
a conclugion? Are we not very doubtful concerning the ex-
istence of oxygen in prussic acid? And are we not, on the
contrary, certain that sulphurated hydrogen, which possesses
many of the characteristics of acids, does not contain any ? Of
the oxygenizement of fluoric and boracic acids, we have no proof:
but then we cannot affirm that any one of these acids exists in
three states of combination with oxygen; and the muriatic is
the only radical of which we admit this fact. We must not,
however, pretend to limit the number or degrees of combi-
nations between combustible bodies and oxygen; but we can

Besides its acid properties, this substance has others, common |
to oxygenizable bodies. With 16 of oxygen, it forms an acid,
