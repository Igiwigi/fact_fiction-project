The smallest resistance actually used here was
Yo00 units. While the electromagnetic balance was under obseryation a horse-shoe
ece of stout copper rod P, connected with the key as shown in the figure, was inserted
V the cups F, H. By this means these cups are brought accurately to the 8ame
Sotential, and nearly all the current is diverted from the standard resistance coils.
& The determination of the electromagnetic balance is rendered more troublesome by
be fact that the firs} motion of the magnet on the reversal of the current is influenced
fy induction, and cannot be used as a test. No attempt was made actually to com-
-Hlete the adjustment, but by preliminary trials resistances from N differing by about
2- unit were found, such that the effects observed were reversed in passing from one
the other. From the magnitude of these effects the required resulb is obtained by
Siterpolation.
