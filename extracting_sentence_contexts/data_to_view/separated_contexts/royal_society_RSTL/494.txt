In repeating this experiment several
different times, he brought the object very correctly to the same
Situations,

\- This result convinced Mr. RAMSDEN, that the eye possessed
the power of varying its adjustment; and he did not think any
more complex experiments would be nearly 80 satisfactory ;
consequently, no others were made, and the man was allowed
to go into the country. It was intended to make him a present of a pair of spectacles,
allowing him to choose those best adapted to his eye; but his
sight was s0 very good, that we entirely forgot it, till some time
after he was gone. These experiments confirmed the former ones s0 very strong-
ly, and from their simplicity were 80 much less liable to error,
that Mr. Ramspen and myself considered the object of our
inquiry completely attained ; the reason for not, at the time,
laying them before this learned Society was, that they estab-
lished no new fact, and the former ones did not appear to require
their support. This inquiry, always regarded as highly important by phy-
siologists, has continued to engage their attention ; and, in the
BAKER1An Lecture for last year, Dr. YouxG has advanced some
experiments to prove, that the adjustment of the eye to different
distances, depends upon the crystalline lens : he considers the
results of the experiments made by Mr. RaMsDEN, upon BEn-
JAMIN CLERK's eyes, as inconclusive; and the phenomena met


when deprived of the Crystalline Lens. 5

with, as arising from the smallness of the aperture, and not from
any power of adjustment in the eye. Dr. Youns, therefore,
with a view to obviate all possibility of deception in future,
constructed an optometer, upon the principle of that of Dr.
PoRTERFIELD.
