The submarine observations indicate that this trend does not
extend much beyond St Kilda. It is not easy to account for the positive field found in this area. The only relevant geo-
logical fact is that the islands have apparently undergone continuous submergence since
the ice age. This indicates a return towards isostatic equilibrium but does nothing to explain
why the original uplift occurred. A possible explanation would be that at one time an
upward convection current existed below this region.
