e By default, mathematicians use as axioms all statements they ever encountered in trusted
sources in the form they remember and understand these statements. Trusted sources are
usually monographs and articles in the main (‘refereed’) mathematical journals. Owing to
purely physical, physiological and psychological restrictions nobody can possibly check
in detail proofs of all facts they use, and oftentimes even thoroughly ponder over their
statements.

5. Apocket bestiary of mathematical mistakes

One evident offshoot of the above simplistic picture of Mathematics is that mathematicians are
ashamed to acknowledge and discuss mistakes, not just their own mistakes, but even mistakes in
the published work of others. They are especially reluctant to mention to their students that even
the classics made scores of mistakes.
