At present,
there is no experimental benchmark under agreed upon ‘nom-
inal’ and ‘altered’ cilia conditions that can be used as a testbed
for theoretical and computational models [89]. To evaluate
mathematical models, we need to compare their behaviour to
experimental results, but, more importantly, we need to test
their predictive ability under altered conditions. A major diffi-
culty arises from the fact that the MCC system is composed of
multiple scales that are coupled together via mechanical and
chemical feedback and feed-forward loops from mucus mech-
anics, to cilia beat kinematics, to molecular motor activity. Many of the loops in this hierarchical organization are not
well understood, as highlighted earlier. Mathematical model-

tors, such as particles and bacteria.
