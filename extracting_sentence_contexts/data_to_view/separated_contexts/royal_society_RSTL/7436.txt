Blood which has been reduced by
hydrogen or carbonic acid may be made to furnish crystals of reduced hemoglobin,
which are isomorphous with those of the oxidized body, but which differ from it in
colour and in optical characters when examined with the spectroscope'”. 5. © We may infer from the facts above mentioned that the colouring-matter of blood,
like indigo, is capable of existing in two states of oxidation, distinguishable by a differ-
ence of colour and a fundamental difference in the action on the spectrum. It may be
made to pass from the more to the less oxidized state by the action of suitable reducing
agents, and recovers its oxygen by absorption from the air” (STokrs)". 6.
