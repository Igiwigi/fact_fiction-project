by using the affiliation of y* to the set of weak solutions to (3.36). As vu) — 3y*, we infer that

which implies that 6 = 0, and, consequently, w = 0. The latter conclusion contradicts the fact that

(e) The transversality condition

We consider now the last condition from the Crandall—Rabinowitz theorem; that is, we need to
