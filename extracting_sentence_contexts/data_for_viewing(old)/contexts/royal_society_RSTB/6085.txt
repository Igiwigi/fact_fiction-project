because the length and the height are much the same. In fig. 3 this series is continued
with specimens of R. sumatrensis, R. sondaicus, R. leptorhynchus and an un-named
specimen from Baluchistan. These teeth, with the exception of the last which is on
the brachydont side, are all approximately alike in their proportions. In R. sondaicus
the height of the tooth is almost exactly the same as the width, and a tooth of this
proportion may be taken as a standard to which the term mesodont may very properly
be applied. Compared with such a tooth, that of 2. swmatrensis is on the brachydont

* The tooth of R. simus is peculiar in that the ectoloph is so narrow that, in side view, a large part of the
crochet can be seen. This is marked with a * in the figure. It is perhaps in part an expression of the
extreme hypsodonty.

{ These figures are only alternative ways of expressing the same fact.

side, but only to a very small degree, and certainly not enough to warrant the differ-
entiation of the two forms into “ sub-hypsodont ” and “ sub-brachydont ” as is done
by Marruew.

As far as the present investigation has gone, and here it must be admitted that the
number of specimens and species examined has been much limited by circumstances,
