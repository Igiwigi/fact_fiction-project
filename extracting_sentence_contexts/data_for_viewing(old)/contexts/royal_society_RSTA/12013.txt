Hence, for real values of n, p and gq, it is impossible to fit a point-binomial to a
series of observations for which 6 +- 38, — 28, has a large negative value. The normal
curve, for which pu, = 3y,%, is nearer to any such observations than a point-binomial.

For example, by aid of the modified expressions given in this paper, p. 350, we have

* As another manner of testing, compare the ten-points of the point-binomial for lines with obser-
vations :—
Wheory,. . . > . 66 159 218 19 119 57 21 7 ‘2 08
Observation . . . 57 15° 221°188 12 58 23 11 2 -00

+ A curve drawn through the 30 points of the three point-binomials would be very close to the obser-
vations. As a matter of fact, the skew probability curve passes very near to all 30 points.

t [Miss A, Lee has since calculated the constants of three years of Eastbourne barometric observations
for me. While x and ¢ differ widely from the Cambridge values, she finds p = “89375, q = 10625, a
striking and suggestive agreement. ]
