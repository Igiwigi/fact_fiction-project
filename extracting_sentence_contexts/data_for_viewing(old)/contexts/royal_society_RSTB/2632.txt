simple corals the inner folds of the epitheca continue to grow upwards at the same
rate as the septa and costa, while the outer folds become, at any rate, in many well-
known types, subject to irregular, or partial development. These innermost folds
give rise to the so-called “true theca,” which has, like the coenenchyme, special
centres of calcification ; the outer folds deposit epithecal material, which varies in its
structure, shows no special centres of calcification, and is not always purely calcareous.

Tt also oceurs very frequently in the Turbinolide that the epitheca bears some kind
of armature for the better protection of the solitary growing polyp—spines, kuobs,
ridges, crests, &v. ; not seldom, root-like processes are given off like those characteristic
of the rugose epitheca of Paleozoic corals. In the living Turbinolid, these ‘rootlets ”
are canals in open communication with the visceral chamber of the polyp. This is an
impertant fact when we compare it with the ccenenchymatous canals of the Madre-
poride, &c. In my opinion, the cosnenchymatous canals, and the root-like processes,
are homologous structures originated by the inner wall lining of the epitheca, the
particular modification depending upon the habit of the polyp—solitary or colonial.

I shall now cite a few examples of the occurrence of root-like processes, taken from
Dunean’s account of recent Turbinolidx. “In Lehizotrochus affinis the epitheca
comes up to the very margin, is striated and coarse, yet is inseparable from the wall,
and, indeed, not to be distinguished from it. The radicles are large and are offshoots
of the epitheca.” (“ Madreporaria,” toe. cit., p. 14.) &. fraguas: “The corallum has
an exquisitely fine pellicular epitheca ornamented with curves and vandykes, which is
