likelihood (henceforth A = ML). Analyses were run in R v. 3.0.2 [56]
using the ‘caper’ [57] and ‘phytools’ packages [58]. Models explored
the relationship between brain size and innovation, treating inno-
vation rates as response variables, and including research effort as
a covariate. Analyses that examined the relationship between rela-
tive brain size and innovation included body mass. We also ran
analyses examining absolute brain size, without body mass as a
covariate, to allow comparison of absolute versus relative brain
measures of brain size as predictors of cognitive differences, an
open question in the field [21].

We ran additional analyses (electronic supplementary
material) to take into account the fact that a large number of
species in our database had zero recorded innovations. We ran
a binomial regression predicting the probability that an inno-
vation is observed in each paper based on research effort


(conducted using the method ‘glm’ in R [56]). We also present
the results of using a zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) model, which
provides an alternative method for controlling for the large
number of species with zero recorded innovations [59]. However,
the ZIP model may not be suitable when there are a small
number of observations for some entries (over 58% of the species
had under 20 papers recorded in the Zoological Record survey),
