2. A historical perspective on the meaning of
variation in H. erectus

Most studies of fossil taxa consider variation primarily as
a necessary first step in circumscribing species in order to
understand overarching, species-wide themes and relation-
ships to other taxa—the early history of H. erectus is no
different. From its initial discovery in 1891, the variation
among H. erectus fossils was used to infer higher level taxo-
nomic differences. Scholars disagreed as to whether the
family Hominidae could incorporate the Trinil 2 calotte—or
whether, in fact, the calotte was that of an out-sized gibbon
or other ape (e.g. [14—16]). When that question was resolved
by the abundant fossil finds in Java and China in the 1930s,
the significance in the variation among these specimens
moved to the question of recognizing generic boundaries. In
the early 1900s, inter-regional and sometimes intra-regional
variants were recognized by generic attributions including
Sinanthropus, Pithecanthropus, Meganthropus and even Homo
(e.g. [17-21]). However, those most familiar with the fossils
did not fully consider these designations to represent biologi-
cally significant differences (e.g. [18-21]). Weidenreich based
his opinions on what he saw as a morphological bauplan
shared across Sinanthropus and Pithecanthropus [19-21]. But
