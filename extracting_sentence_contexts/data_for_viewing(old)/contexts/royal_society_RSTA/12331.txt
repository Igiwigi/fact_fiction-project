tendency in it as compared to the air above, is caused to reverse what would otherwise
be its motion towards the Equator, and to take its course towards the Pole instead.
The next publication to which I have to advert is a second paper by Mr, Ferret,
It is entitled “The Motions of Fluids and Solids, relative to the Earth’s Surface ;
comprising Applications to the Winds and the Currents of the Ocean,’* and is dated
at its close, “ Cambridge, Mass., February, 1860,” and is noted on its title-page as
being “ Taken from the First and Second Volumes of the ‘ Mathematical Monthly.’”
In that paper he offered a scheme of atmospheric circulation totally different from
his previous one of 1856, and entailing a fundamentally altered theory. In fact, he

there abandoned his arrangement of six zonal vortex rings of circulation, three for the
northern hemisphere and three for the southern, and, instead, he adopted really the
scheme that had been put forward by me in 1857 with its two great currents of
primary circulation, one flowing from equatorial to polar regions above, and the other
flowing as a great return current from polar to equatorial regions below ; together
with the bottom subordinate current close on the surface of the Earth in middle
latitudes or middle and higher latitudes, flowing pole-ward on account of the frictional
retardation by the Earth’s surface of its eastward relative motion and consequent
diminution of centrifugal tendency.
