The echoes which did appear were mostly from
the height of Region E, except for about four hours around noon, when echoes were
definitely obtained from Region F. We feel bound to conclude, bearing in mind
the evidence of the (P’, ¢) records over this period, that this is a case of genuine
electron limitation during most of the day. The occasional appearance of echoes
from Region E may have been due to the arrival in our atmosphere of charged
solar particles, but the unmistakable Region F echoes around noon were almost
certainly due to ultra-violet radiation from the sun. Evidently this is due to the
fact that although the sun does not rise at ground level at Tromsé at midwinter,
its rays penetrate to Region F and are capable of ionizing there although they have
traversed a large part of the atmosphere. Although shortage of personnel did not permit more than relatively few 24-hour
runs for the hourly determinations of critical frequency, we have been able to supple-
ment this information at certain times of the day from the (P’, ¢) records obtained on
the international frequencies. For example, on such records obtained, using a
frequency of 2 Mc./sec., itis found that there is a “‘ jump” from reflexion at Region
F to reflexion at Region E in the morning with the advent of sunrise, and a “‘ jump ”
in the opposite direction just before sunset.
