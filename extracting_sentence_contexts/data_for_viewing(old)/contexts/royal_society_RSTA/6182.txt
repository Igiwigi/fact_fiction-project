inset of figure 2. To avoid buckling, as the force on the poker approaches zero, the poking is
stopped. For rulers, similar force-displacement behaviour is observed at all poking locations,
nevertheless, the measured values may vary significantly. Similar to the procedure suggested in
[9] all the force-displacement curves are combined to outline a stability landscape, as shown
in figure 2. In contrast to the stability landscape previously introduced for cylinders, which
characterizes the stability of the system to poking at a given location, under changing axial
loads, here the landscape describes the force response of poking at all locations under a given
end-to-end displacement. Therefore, this landscape exhibits two distinct ridges and an unstable
lake indicating where buckling occurs. The boundary of the unstable lake corresponds to the
displacement at which buckling occurs.

While specific force response curves are unique to the poking location, the resulting
deformations are practically identical. In fact, when examining the experimental data in

Figure 2. A stability landscape of a ruler. The landscape describes the measured force response of the plate (F,), with constant a
end-to-end displacement boundary conditions, to poking at multiple locations. The poker displacement (D,) and location (X,) : 8
are the coordinate along the x and y-directions in figure 1, respectively, though D, = 0 does not correspond to y = 0 and D8
X, = 0 does not correspond to x = 0. The unstable lake is identified as the region of zero force where the plate buckles and : S
