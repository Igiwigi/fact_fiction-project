We also see that the retention
2 on the epiderm of portions of the bases of the leaves hides what should otherwise
=> represent the regularly arranged leaf-scars seen in the common Lepidodendroid stems. Whether, in the species under consideration, these leaf-petioles were persistent, or
© whether, as the stem advanced in age, they fell off, leaving a natural cicatrix of the forms
2 represented in fig. 6, is doubtful; but my present belief is that the latter was the case,
& and that the fact explains why we only find such examples as I have figured of compa-
<£ ratively small size. Z L have sections of one example of the above type from South Owram, near Halifax,
and for which I am indebted to Mr. Nz1.D of Oldham, in which the cellular element
-2 of the medullary axis is reduced to its minimum. The axis consists mainly of barred
S vessels; nevertheless cells exist in sufficient numbers to demonstrate the identity of the
E two forms.
