unanimity prevails on the subject of the association of one neuromere with the
acustico-facial nerve-complex. This particular neuromere is tabulated by that author
as the fourth of the hind-brain neuromeres usually recognised. It is further deter-
mined as being that neuromere which lies immediately in front of the one which lies
opposite the central part of the auditory plate. These are the characteristics of our
“ facial” neuromere, which is therefore the one which is commonly enumerated as the
“ fourth hind-brain neuromere.” But it is also identical with Locy’s and Cas, Hint’s
ninth neural segment, and Neat’s ‘ Encephalomere v.”

The neuromere in front of that just identified, likewise possesses easily recognisable
features. It is distinguished by out-standing prominence and sharpness of definition,
and also by the absence, either complete or very nearly complete, of any proliferative
contribution to, or connection with, the neural crest. It lies, in fact, opposite the
hiatus in the neural crest which separates the acustico-facial from the trigeminal
Anlagen. This, our “first prefacial” neuromere, is thus, both relatively from its
position, and absolutely through its intrinsic characters, identifiable with the “ eighth
segment” of Locy and Cuas. Hin, and with “ Encephalomere iv” of Neau, It
appears in NEAt’s Table 2 as Segment No. 3 of the hind-brain.

The “ first postfacial neuromere” of Ornithorhynchus lies opposite the centre of the
auditory plate. This is Locy’s and Cuas. Hix's tenth segment, and Neat’s
“Encephalomere vi.” It has no certain ganglionic connection, although we have
stated above that a few cells persist at its margin and thus represent the other-
wise interrupted neural crest at this transverse plane. So far we are unable to
confirm Nrat’s judgment in reference to Squalus, that the glossopharyngeus nerve is
