Even here one or two very definite-looking strands are seen stretching
across the cavity of the eye from the lens to the retina. These certainly look like
normal structures, but no doubt, even at this stage, the cavity of the eye contains a
certain amount of albuminous fluid, and the strands in question may be due to
coagulation. In fact, a reticulum, formed presumably by coagulation, is already
present in the primary parietal vesicle represented in fig. 29. The occurrence of nuclei, scattered sparsely in the vitreous body, has already been
mentioned.
