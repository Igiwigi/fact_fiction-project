S At an early stage in our researches, when we found, contrary to our expectation, that

deduced from experiments in the bores of guns themselves, we came to the conclusion
that this departure from our expectation was probably due to the heat stored up in the
liquid residue. In fact, instead of the expansion of the permanent gases taking place
without addition of heat, the residue, in the finely divided state in which it must be on
the ignition of the charge, may be considered a source of heat of the most perfect
character, and available for compensating the cooling effect due to the expansion of the
gases on production of work.
The queztion, then, that we now have to consider is—What will be the conditions
of expansion of the permanent gases when dilating in the bore of a gun and drawing
