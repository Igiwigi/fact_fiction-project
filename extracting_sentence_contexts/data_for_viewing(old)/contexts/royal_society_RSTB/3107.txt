organs, but the improbability of this is shown by the fact that they sometimes
contain starch in minute granules.

In the higher plants oil has not yet been proved to be a direct product of carbon
dioxide assimilation.*

On the contrary, WAKKER states that the oil in the chlorophyll bodies of
Monocotyledons which form no starch is not a product of assimilation, but rather
indicates the beginning of degeneration. He also notes that the oil was chiefly
found in plants grown in greenhouses. This statement is interesting in connection
with the fact that all the outgrowths developed during the present experiments
were formed in plants grown under glass.

The formation of the oil in the outgrowths appears to be closely connected with
respvration. In certain other cases the production of oil is known to be due to
imperfect respiration. For example, a fungus growing in air may contain
comparatively little oil, whereas the same fungus when submerged in water or a
nutritive fluid becomes crowded with oil in large and small drops. Here, of course,
there can be no question of carbon dioxide assimilation.

In Potamogeton, as noted above, oil is formed in submerged leaves. Again, in the
Crassulacee there is a distinct relation between feeble respiration.and the formation
of oil.
