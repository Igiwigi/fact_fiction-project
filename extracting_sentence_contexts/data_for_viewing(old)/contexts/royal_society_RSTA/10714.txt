the main heat to the circulating system. The experiment at 60° was taken, however,
when no other gas was being used in the building, and the conditions were unusually
steady. Rises of temperature of 11° and 5° were tried as a check on the measure-
ments. The correction for Thermometer E is that obtained in the test in Group IL,

This series includes another attempt to obtain the high temperatures, but nearly
all the experiments were spoiled by the liberation of air inside the calorimeter. The
experiment at 67° is given as an illustration of the effect produced by the appearance
of air. In this series the air bubbles were found in the calorimeter water after the
experiment, in spite of the fact that the distilled water was kept continuously boiling
as it was supplied to the head bottles, and was cooled from 100° ©. only by the cold

meter E is the same as for the last series.
