Results are obtained
conditionally on the Binder estimate of the outer clustering. (Online version in colour.)

(see figure 6). Notably, around a quarter of the individuals in outer Cluster 2, as captured by its
inner Cluster 2, forward COVID-19 messages to many more people (question j = 3) than subjects
in inner Cluster 1 of outer Cluster 2. Figure 4 also supports the fact that outer Cluster 2 engages
with WhatsApp in a much more persistent manner than the other outer clusters. These results
highlight that a sizeable minority of WhatsApp users has a relatively large propensity to spread
COVID-19 messages during a critical phase of the pandemic. This is in line with a similar survey
in Singapore [38] and findings on ‘superspreaders’ on other social media.
