gegard to one another, that even the fundamental points of action of aconite and
Qconitine still remain in a condition of unsettlement and dispute. It may safely be

Sbtained so scanty a harvest of facts. As illustrative of these divergences, the
following may be quoted :—

Aconitine acts fatally, according to Boum with Warrmann,} by poisoning the
