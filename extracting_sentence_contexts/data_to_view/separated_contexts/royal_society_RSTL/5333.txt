Art. (38.). Having now determined the general values of 9 and Z in the equation
tf'(z) —7fr+3=0 as explicit integral functions of the roots of fx, the more difficult
task remains to assign to 7 its valne similarly expressed: - This cannot readily be
effected by means of sabstitutions in the general formulze, the method. we adopted for
finding t and 9; but all the other quantities except'r in the syzyzetic equation being
integral functions of the roots, it is evident that 7,also mnst be an integral function

if'o—$3

of the same, and to obtain it we' may use theexpression 7= F? To obtain the general form of 7 by direct calculation, from this formula would
however be found to be jimpracticable ;, the mode I adopt therefore to discover the
general expression for 7 corresponding to different values of 9, is to ascertain its
value'on the hypothesis of particular" relations existing between the roots of ;fv, and
then'from' the particular valnes of '7 thus obtained to/infer demonstrativelyits general
form, as will be seen. below.:,, The demonstration, of = is unayoidably somewhat long,
T being in fact represented by a double sum of partial symmetrical functions. Vsing the subseript indices of each function as the syzygetic equation to denote its
degree in z, we have in general
