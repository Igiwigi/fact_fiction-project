Summarizing, very small spatial sizes are just one of the factors determining
which is the fundamental physics governing a system. For a phenomenon to
be classical, the common wisdom is for h to be small compared to relevant
parameters of the system. Size is one of these parameters, but is not the unique
one. It may turn out that processes taking place along hundreds of angstroms (just
100 atoms in a row) are already sufficiently large to obey laws that—although
having a quantum ingredient—in principle are valid only macroscopically, such
as black-body radiation [27].

(b) Can quantum mechanics be intrinsically nonlinear?

Assume that a process is, in fact, quantum at the characteristic sizes we
shall study. We can ask then if exactly the same type of nonlinear effects
emerging in classical physics at those scales (cf. §2a) could occur in the

quantum case. The above qualification ‘exactly’ is not just rhetorical. Here, it
concretely means the kind of effects and behaviour resulting from a classical
system that is described by nonlinear dynamical equations. In other words,
for non-relativistic microscopic processes down to the atomic level, i.e. at
