The fibres of the
commissural portion of the inner ring also run for the most part regularly, but
still a plexiform arrangement is very obvious. This inner ring is very closely con-
nected with the sensory surfaces of the mouth, and it also shades off into a plexus
of filaments connected with the epithelium lining the cesophagus. In point of fact,
it may be very accurately described as a local hypertrophy or condensation of this
cesophageal sensory nerve plexus, The outer ring, on the other hand, is connected

with the innervation of the well-developed muscles of this region, and may similarly
be described as a local development of a nerve-plexus connected with the musculature
of the cesophagus. Having thus established the fact that the inner ring is sensory
and the outer motor, can we proceed a step further and identify the two rings with
the two parts, anterior and posterior, of the typical ganglion?
