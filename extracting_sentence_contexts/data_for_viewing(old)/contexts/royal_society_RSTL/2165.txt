various combinations of the muscles have a relation with the
motor nerves, the same relations must be established by
those nerves which convey the impression of their combina-
tions, and a similar plexus or interchange of filaments there-
fore characterizes both.

We have seen that the returning muscular nerves are
associated with the nerves of sensibility to the skin, but they
Â© are probably very distinct in their endowments, since there
is a great difference between conveying the sense of external
impressions, and that of muscular action.

In surgical operations the fact is forced upon our attention
that the pain of cutting the skin is exquisite, compared with
that of the muscles ; but we must remember that pain is a
modification of the endowment of a nerve, serving as a guard
to the surface, and to the deeper parts consequently. This
has been some days separated from the brain, the muscle is excited as when the
nerve was first divided. The property, however it may be defined, is therefore in
the nerve. Our language might perhaps be made more precise if we used terms

which implied the course of neryous influence, whether from or towards the brain ;
but it will be difficult to express this without the aid of hypothesis.
