Its interest is that its development apparently bears the same relationship to that
of Diplosoma as does this last to that of Polysyncraton. The tadpole larva hatches
with not merely one but three blastozooids all as well developed as the oozoid, a
stage reached by Diplosoma a week or ten days after the tail of the tadpole has been
absorbed. VIIâ€”GENERAL

Taken as a whole, the facts presented in the preceding sections form a somewhat
confusing picture, and it is only on analysis that certain significant correlations
appear. Eggs of the same size may develop at the same rate or at different rates ; eggs of
different sizes may develop in the same time or may be widely different. Gastru-
lation may be embolic, epibolic, or intermediate between these two types.
