The mathematical approach is deductive from the
equations of motion, rather than being based on
kinematic hypotheses. A key finding, accessible via
the Poisson scaling, is that the regime of negative
ting frequency group velocities extends to high wavenumbers, while
being confined to a narrow band of frequencies. Thus responses localized in space are possible for
near-monochromatic forcing, an important fact for
nonlinear theories of tube dynamics near the ring
frequency. This article is part of the theme issue ‘Wave
generation and transmission in multi-scale complex
media and structured metamaterials (part 1)’. Keywords:
dispersion relation, dominant balance, elastic
wave, group velocity, negative Poisson’s ratio,
