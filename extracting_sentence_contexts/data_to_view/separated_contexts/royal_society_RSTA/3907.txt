In practice,
statistics and machine-learning methods have therefore become increasingly important to find
patterns or correlations in complex datasets, whereas mechanistic mathematical modelling has
not become mainstream. In our view, we find two contrasting perspectives on the topic of mathematics in general
and computational modelling in particular in biosciences. On the one hand, modelling living
systems and diseases appears unrealistic; possibly, if we wait a century or two then we may
have assembled all the facts and observations [8]. This is a viewpoint not uncommon in the
life-science community in general and among medical doctors in particular. The idea being
that we need to have ‘all’ the experimental facts on the table before even embarking upon
such an ambitious modelling task.
