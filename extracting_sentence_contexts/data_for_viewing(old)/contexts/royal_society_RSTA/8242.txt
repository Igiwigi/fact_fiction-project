Hence, writing YW, for V,, in (13), we see that, unless Vn = Day

But

I Oe de dy = \\ Vey, .Ve¥, de dy,
my (| {(v? R}? + (V3 1} da dy,

and the last integral cannot vanish unless V? R, V?1, and therefore (by the boundary
conditions) R and I, vanish everywhere. We deduce that 278 (= %, — ,) must be
zero, so that a, and A, are purely real.

All * Normal” Disturbances come ultimately to zero.
6. Given this result, we can show at once that all the 4’s are in fact negative in the
special case now considered. Multiplying (8) by V’, and integrating, we have
af] WW, de dy =v | Y.VIw, dedy, .. 2... (IA)

or, by Green’s theorem, in virtue of the boundary conditions (9),

Aye} Ox /

Since both integrals are necessarily positive, this proves the required result.

The Method of Expansion.

7. Thus, on our starting assumption, we have demonstrated stability (in the case
