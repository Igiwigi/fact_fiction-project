Very recently,
extremely long period (up to 60 h) magnetic oscillations were also reported in a number of
sunspots [47]. However, the interpretation of these fluctuations in terms of intrinsic magnetic
oscillations is debated [48,49]. Spurious magnetic oscillations may in fact arise from the cross-
talk between other physical quantities. In particular, in the presence of a vertical gradient of
the magnetic field (as is the case for many magnetic structures in the solar atmosphere), opacity
effects can also play a significant role [49]. Indeed, due to opacity changes, the height of formation
of the spectral line changes too, hence the sampled height varies from which the information
is extracted.
