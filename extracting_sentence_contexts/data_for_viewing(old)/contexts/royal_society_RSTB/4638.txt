The next most numerous breaking point is after the eleventh segment, of which


REPRODUCTION OF THE SYLLID PROCERASTEA, 153

there are seven instances, this being one of the natural breaking points in the scheme
explained above on pp. 141 and 142. There are three instances with nine original
segments and three with nineteen, both natural breaking points. On the other hand,
there are three instances with fifteen original segments, which is not a natural
breaking point, two with eighteen, and single instartces with other numbers which
are unexpected. These irregularities can be explained in two ways, either as being
due to injury at the breaking point, which may lead to a whole segment being
absorbed or degenerating before regeneration commences, or to the fact that a
second fragmentation of the worm has taken place before the regeneration following
a previous fragmentation has been quite complete. Probably the three instances of
fifteen segments and the two with eighteen are to be explained by the first of these
hypotheses.

Turning now to specimens in which there has been clear regeneration of both
anterior and posterior ends, the instances of which there are definite records,
number 151, and are as follows :—

Worms with 4 original segments are recorded 68 times.
