This I have tried to
explain diagrammatically by figs. 17 to 30. Such a reduplication of the loose penial
coating would almost completely separate the copulatory organ from the urodzeum,
and, in fact, these folds leave in the Monotremata a small opening near the root of the
penis groove for the reception of the sperma from the sinus urogenitalis, but not for
the urine and for the eggs. The walls of the urodeum, into which the urogenital
sinus opens, are very thin, and the muscular, chiefly longitudinal, coating is likewise
weak, with the exception of the voluntary striped muscle on its ventral aspect
(fig. 28). This chamber UD, the urodzum, receives in the middle of its ventral wall
the urine and the eggs, but not the sperma.
