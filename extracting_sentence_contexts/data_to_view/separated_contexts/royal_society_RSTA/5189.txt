It follows that
Ay > (—2aCn?)!/4 = (—20C) 1! n?/%,
Combining this with (3.2), we obtain

—2aCyt/e
xy — 1 2 (= Day 2 (2c) at = PAY tye,

for n large enough, proving the desired estimate with Cy,) = (—2ac)!/"/2. a

This property for the minimizers of this very repulsive case is similar to H-stability in statistical
mechanics [44], where the minimal distance between two particles is expected to be constant
when 1 is large, and crystallization occurs. This also suggests that the lower bound O(n! *2/@) is
not sharp, which is verified in figure 2. In fact, numerical experiments in [12,38] suggest that confinement happens for —1 <a <1. It is an open problem to obtain a uniform bound in the support of the discrete minimizers as
in §2 in this range. In the range a < —1, our numerical simulations suggest that spreading of
the support happens for all y, with a decreasing spreading rate as y increases.
