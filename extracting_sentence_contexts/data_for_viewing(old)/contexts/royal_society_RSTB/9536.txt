change it. This is the (also very superannuated) argument
implicating what Bentham called the ‘sinister interests’ of
‘Judge & Co.’. To my mind, it reflects a misunderstanding
of adversarial procedure, at two levels. It also underestimates
the extent to which significant procedural reform has already
been implemented, especially during the last decade or so.

The first level of misunderstanding concerns the somewhat
complex relationship between adversarial criminal procedure
and truth-finding in adjudication. Lawyers, it is said, play
adversarial games and courts are concerned only with forensic
proof rather than the factual truth of ‘what really happened’
regarding disputed facts. Critics fail to appreciate that adver-
sarial procedure is designed to promote truth-seeking not to
frustrate it. Before sceptical readers fall about laughing, let
me stress that this is a claim about the system as a whole and

its institutional design, not about the motivations of pro-
fessional participants in particular cases. Indeed, the very
self-serving partisanship which adversarial lawyers are
expected to display in developing their litigation strategies is
the motor that drives adversarial truth-seeking. The parties
have both the presumptive knowledge and the strongest
motivation to present their own best cases to the fact-finder,
and to interrogate their adversarial opponent’s arguments
