In ome instances it can be observed that instead of
the whole pit membrane being uniformly coloured, it may be traversed by one or bwo
coloured bands which run through the otherwise colourless substance of the membrane
(refer to figure). In favourable instances well defined striation can be een. In an
en face view of the pits it becomes evident that the pit membrane exhibits essentially
the same appearance as that presented by a sieve-plate (Plate 70, fig. 28), and the
appearance of the two coloured bands is explained from the fact that in some instances
the whole membrane is not necessarily perforated, but that the perforation and hence
the sieve-plate structure may be confined to particular areas of the membrane of the
pib. This particular distribution of perforating areas also explained the appearance of
bifurcation, which is sometimes presented by the apex of much contracted protoplasmic
