on each other, being connected by the equation given above, and there will be a
relation between the forms for two different theories. In fact if S and T are the
forms corresponding to any one mode of separation and if we write :

s=8+0

where U is any arbitrary vector function we shall have

where

TVe=iT— | div Udr,

and 8’ and T’ are appropriate forms for a new mode of separation. In this way, by
assigning convenient values for U, we might tentatively construct a number of
