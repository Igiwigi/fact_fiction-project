* Should a fatal accident befal either the male or female bird after this alliance is
newly formed, no time is lost in unavailing sorrow, nor any great nicety shown in
forming a new connection, as the following little history will evince. A pair of
magpies began to build their nest in a gentleman's garden at Burbage, in Wiltshire.
Disliking their familiarity, he shot one of them from an ambush made for the pur-
pose. The next day there were again a pair going on with the work. One of these
was also hot. The loss was not long in repairing, for the day following the pair
were again complete, when another fell a victim to the gun. Thus the gentleman
went on destroying one of them daily until he had killed seven ; but all to no pur-
pose—the remaining magpie 50on found another mate. The nest was finished, and
young ones were produced, which were suffered to fly. This is an extraordinary
fact.—It seems to show that nature has a reserve of birds in an unconnected state,
immediately ready to repair losses. Were the whole to pair at once, the circum-
jacent country might be insufficient to furnish food for the immense number of
young ones that must burst forth at the same time.

finishes this business in 'a shorter space of time than any

other bird, but as he deviates 80 widely from the common

laws of the feathered society, I shall select the s8wift, as a
