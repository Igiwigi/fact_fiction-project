the sporogonium of Bryophytes, it has been desirable to see how far this is a faetor
also in the Pteridophytes.* Examination has shown that sterilisation occurs in the
sporangia of many of them; it may affect only individual cells of the sporogenous
tissue, which then serve as transitory nutritive cells; in certain cases, however, it
involves tissue-tracts, or even whole sporangia. Jt 7s thus seen that there is in the
Pteridophyta the essential basis of fact necessary for a theory of sterilisation in them
also.

Theory of the Strobilus.

The fertile zone of a strobilus may, like the fertile zone of a Moss-sporogonium, be
regarded as a residuum from sterilisation, since it has a similar relation to the vege-
tative system. This makes it desirable to inquire whether the Bryophyte analogy will
suggest how the strobilus of the simplest Pteridophyta may have come into existence,
and this may legitimately be done without assuming near community of ancestry
between these two essentially different types. For our study relates to the methods
of advance, and is not bound by the restrictions of exact homology.
