W. CROOKES ON THE VISCOSITY OF GASES. Molecules‚Äù * I drew attention to the fact that a molecular ray producing green
phosphorescence can be projected 102 millims. from the negative pole when the
pressure is as high as 0'324 millim. or 427 M. In this case the mean free path of the
molecules is 0'23 millim. ; and it is not surprising that with more powerful induction
discharges, and with special appliances for exalting the faint action to be detected, the
above-named phenomena can be produced at till higher pressures.

719. It must be remembered that we know nothing of the absolute length of the free
path or the absolute velocity of a molecule ; these may vary almost from zero to infinity.
