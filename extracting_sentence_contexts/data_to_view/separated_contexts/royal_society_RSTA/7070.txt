E(mercury fulminate) = 25-1kcal. (6-6-4) = 26-6 kcal. Again, at quite low temperatures, the amount of 664 used must be increased above its
normal value in order to get it to detonate. The violence of the detonation of both mercury
fulminate and 664, at temperatures which correspond to induction times of the order of a
few minutes, was noticeably less than their violence at higher temperatures, a fact which
points to a slow thermal decomposition of the mercury fulminate during the induction
period. In view of the marked dependence of the length of the induction periods of mercury
fulminate on its amount (see p. 211) it would not be evident from the above experiments
whether the longer induction periods for 664 result from the smaller amount of fulminate,
or from dilution. This point was settled by increasing the amount of 664 so that its fulminate
content was equal to the amount of fulminate normally used in ignition experiments.
