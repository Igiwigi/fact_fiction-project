Iam inclined to
suspect that the opinion that these lines belong to X is too hasty. As is well known
Baty found quite a large number of lines in Kr and X coincident within his
observation errors, which indeed were much smaller than those in any measures yet
made in RaEm. Now as a fact those suspected lines of RAmsAy and Camrronâ€™s
are also very close to these Kr lines. A strong argument also is this. There are a
number of strong lines undoubtedly belonging to the RaEm spectrum, and observed
by both Rurnerrorp and Royp and by Watson, which are also near strong X lines,
yet separated so far from them, that if Ramsay and Cameron had had X in their
tube they must have seen them and RaEm lines as double, one due to X and
the other to RaEm.
