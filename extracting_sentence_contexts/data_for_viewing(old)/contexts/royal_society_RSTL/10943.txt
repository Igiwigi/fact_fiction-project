fold in the narial valve (2.v.), and there is a wide and hollowed space between it and
the part forming the inner floor. That part is now tubular, the top of the tube (7c.c.)
being sharp and fitting against the base of the septum. Besides the two pairs of
glandular crypts (91.c.), there is, in each tube of cartilage, an apparently glandular
body ; this is © Jacopsox's organ” (5.0.), a structure which will appear in several of
these selected sections.*

Small points of bone are now apparent beneath the nasal canal, right and leſt,
these are the premaxillaries ( pz.) ; the nasals (n.) are still een above.

7th Section (Plate 3, fig. 7) —This section is behind the alinasal, in the fore part of
the aliseptal region. The thickening which sbowed itself in the middle of the septum
in the last section is now at the base ; it is due to the fact that the intertrabecula is
esxentially a roundish and somewhat compressed bar of cartilage, which has shot up
into a thick crest to join the roofs of the nasal capsule («l.sp.). The middle valyular
fold has now 8unk down 80 as to be opposite the base of the septum; between it and the

List.” In my earlier papers on the skull my attention had not been directed to this part, and I was nob
then aware of the curions modification of the fore part of the 8kull caused by it. In the paper on the
Pig's skull (Phil. Trans., 1874, Plates 28-37) the snpporting cartilage is figured and described as the
*recurrent cartilage”—a name I shall retain. In the more recent papers on the skull of the Snake
(Phil. Trans., 1878, Plates 27-33), and in that on the skull of the Lizard (Phil. Trans., 1879, Plates
37-45), I have called the pair of Jacopsox's organs by RarakE's term, namely, © nasal glands ;” this,
however, is a misleading term, as they have nothing to do with the nasal glands of Birds. In the Snake
