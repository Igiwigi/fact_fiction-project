One of the
most interesting results of this study are that the measured energy cascade rates show highly
intermittent values and statistics. This was briefly touched upon in the earlier review [8] as one
of the sources of temporal intermittency in solar wind observations; borrowed from an idea for
atmospheric turbulence first proposed by Oboukhov [23]. The recognition that MHD plasmas are strongly affected by the magnetic fields that thread
through them is now a well-established fact of plasma physics. Any study which does not
realistically take this essential anisotropic feature of plasmas into account has a significant
shortcoming. Oughton et al. [10] review our current understanding of anisotropy in solar wind
plasma turbulence, both in the inertial range and, crucially, at the kinetic scales of the sub-ion



range.
