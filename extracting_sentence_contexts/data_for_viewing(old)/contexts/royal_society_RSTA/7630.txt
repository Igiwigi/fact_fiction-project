Qualitatively, the agreement is moderately good, for there is fair accordance both
with the sense and magnitude of the variation with temperature, especially having
regard to the smallness of the magnitudes concerned. The magnitudes of the experi-
mental values of #, and of the expression derived through the Lorenz-Lorentz relation
from 4, are not in such good agreement; but the discordance between them would be
increased if the expression containing 4, had been derived through either the Gladstone
and Dale or the Newton-Laplace relations.

In explanation of the disparity which remains, it is pertinent to mention that
Berthelot shows that the observed value of the departure from Boyle’s law for air is also
not in such good agreement with the value calculated from his characteristic equation
as it is with other gases which he investigated. This may be largely due to the fact that
air is not a pure gas, and the values of the critical constants for air have not the same
definite physical significance as they have for pure gases.

In support of this explanation it can be shown that the values of #, derived from actual
compressibility measurements on air at low pressures are much closer to the values
obtained from the refractivity measurements. Thus, for instance, Rayleigh (1905) has
measured 6 for air at 11° C for expansions from 0-5 to 1 atm. and gives the value of

0-00046 per atm., corresponding to —0-60; x 10-® per mm. Berthelot (1907) quotes
the value of —0-00040 per atm. at 16° C, as measured by himself and Sacerdote,
corresponding to —0 «10-8 per mm. Assuming these two values and a linear
change of é with ¢ over the limited range of temperature of 5° C, then
