The cells marked h, to h; are also very commonly seen in the dense part of
layer. They are very small cells and have very small nuclei; those represents
the figure were drawn with the same lens as the rest of the cells in fig. 16 (Retom
ls immersion and oce. 4). Their nuclei, also, are commonly seen to be underg
division into two by simple amitotic division.

The origin of these cells I have been unable to determine, they may be eithe
product of the larger fusiform cells or they may be derived from those cells in y
the fragmentation of the nucleus was observed ; their size and the appearance of
nucleus strongly inclines me to the latter view, but there is so much differene
opinion as to the possible formation of cells in this manner that I must leave
origin an open question, merely insisting upon the fact that they are a new form
and that they were not present during Stage I.

The occurrence of amitotic division or of fragmentation, and the entire ab
of mitosis in the cells of the stroma, is remarkable. According to the researche}
Fremmine (14), and Zrecier (84), fragmentation does not lead to the reprod C
of cells, but to degeneration, while, on the other hand, Mercunrkorrâ€™s researches (
throw grave doubts upon the destruction of polynuclear cells, and Hickson (22,
shows that the nucleus of the ovum of Millepora plicata and of Allopora fragm
and that the cells of the blastoderm are formed of cells whose nuclei consist 0}
fragments of the nucleus of the ovum.

These researches are extended in a paper by the same author (24), and Dr. Hick
