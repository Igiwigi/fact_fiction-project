The fact that the broadening is
observed to vary significantly with loading condition and to follow the crack tip suggests that this
broadening is not primarily owing to the dislocations associated with the crack-tip plastic zone
(so-called type III microstresses). This broadening arises from the steep gradients in residual stress
sampled across the 60 um beam dimension. This is evidenced by the fact that the peak broadening
is a maximum not at the position of maximum elastic (and plastic) strain (figure 7a (bottom)) but
occurs just behind this where the gradient in strain is at its steepest. The diffraction peak width in
the crack wake should be directly comparable to the conventional X-ray fractographic analysis. Here, the line profile is slightly broader than the far-field level extending to a depth (dashed line)
of around approximately 0.5 mm from the crack faces (figure 7a (top)) which is probably indicative
of the depth of the plastic zone.
