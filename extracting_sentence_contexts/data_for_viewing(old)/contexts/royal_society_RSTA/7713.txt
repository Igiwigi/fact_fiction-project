B the statistical problem of estimating 0, independent of any knowledge of probabilities

& a priori. Once 6 (E) and 6 (E) are determined corresponding to a value of « close

8 to unity, say « = 0-99, the statistician desiring to estimate 6, may be recommended

4 (1) to observe the values of the random variables %, . . . %,, (2) to calculate the

S corresponding values of @ (E) and 6 (E), and (3) to state that the value of the para-

meter 0, is within the limits @ (E) = 0, = 9 (E).

The justification of this recommendation lies in the fact that the three steps

g described are equivalent to a random experiment which may result either in a correct

& or in an erroneous statement concerning the value of 6,, the probability of a correct

8 statement being equal tox = 0-99. Thus the statistician following the above recom-

2 mendation is in a position comparable with that of a game of chance with the

g probability of winning being equal to « = 0-99. 3 ;
