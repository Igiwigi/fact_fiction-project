are either of type 4 (6) or 4 (g), with the type 6 (c) in the transition stage (see fig. 6).
The curve giving the intermediate type is the curve S(X, }#)=1. This curve, which
passes through the points w = x/:/3, v = 4x, and p = 2-229, v = 0, has been drawn
in fig. 9. When » = 2-229, the curves are always of the type 4 (/).

15.62. It is at once evident that when p < 2-229 there is no well-defined connection
between the shape of the stream lines and the stability of the system. The stream lines
are first of one type and then of another—and, in fact, when y is slightly less than
x/4/3, the stable types include all the possible forms of stream line. It is only wher
u. = 2-229 that there is a distinct connection between the stability and the shape of the

stream lines—the latter are always of one type and the system is always stable.

The discussion of the bounded symmetrical double row is very similar to that of the
bounded unsymmetrical double row. In this system there are positive vortices at the
points (2nb, a) and negative vortices at the points (2nb,— a); and the width of the
