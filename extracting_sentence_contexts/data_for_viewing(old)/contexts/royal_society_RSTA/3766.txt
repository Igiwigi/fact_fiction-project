the secondary flows were confined to the roughness sublayer (20-30% of 5). For coarser spacings,
the secondary flows still existed but were weakened with respect to the optimal case and were
capable of creating tertiary vortex pairs at harmonics of the surface spacing.

When present, the secondary flows resulted in low-momentum pathways (LMPs) aligned with
the elevated surfaces and high-momentum pathways (HMPs) in the valleys in between. For all
the cases we considered, the HMP was located in the centre of the valley, with the exception of
the coarsest spacing where HMPs were located offset from the centre, owing to the presence of
tertiary vortices in the valley. The variation of the streamwise velocity in these LMPs and HMPs
could differ by as much as 20% from the spanwise-averaged mean velocity.

The variation of the in-plane velocities of the counter-rotating vortices was not nearly as severe,
having magnitudes of approximately 2% of Uso. This value is in fact comparable to the turbulence
intensity, u’/U>o, which ranged from 1.5% in the free stream to 10% at the wall. This means that,
while the secondary flows dramatically alter the streamwise velocity magnitude, they would not
severely impact the mean flow angle.

The generation of secondary flows has serious ramifications for flows over arbitrary surfaces
as even apparently random surfaces can develop secondary flows [33]. We suggest that the
