The Concept of the Stomatal Index. So far it has been sufficient for the purposes of our enquiry into the ecological
significance of stomatal frequency to treat of the absolute frequency as observed. his
is the aspect that has been almost exclusively considered by previous writers on this
subject. It is, however, apparent that a high stomatal frequency may be either the
outcome of the formation of a larger proportion of stomate mother-cells in the epidermis
or the high frequency may be an outcome of the fact that, though the proportion of
stomata is no greater, their absolute number on a given area is raised by reason of the
small size of the normal epidermal cells. Conversely a low stomatal frequency may be
due to exceptional growth of the epidermal cells, thus increasing the distance between
the stomata and diminishing their number per unit area ; or it may be due to a failure
to form the normal proportion of stomata. It is, therefore, convenient to have some method of expressing stomatal frequency
independent of their spacing through growth of the intervening unspecialised epidermal
cells.
