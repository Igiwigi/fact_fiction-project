size photograph in Plate 1 are from a complete transverse section. A full
description will be given later, but the topography of the section may be explained
here.

Assuming that the cross-section of the complete trunk was circular, the speci-
men represents a rough sector including a little less than one-third of the circle
(see text-fig. 10). The top of the figure, where the bifurcating stems are grouped,
probably lies not far from the centre of the false stem ; the right and left ends of
the section, occupied by the stoutest petioles and by roots mostly running ver-
tically, form parts of the peripheral zone. The actual exterior of the trunk is not
preserved.

An important fact is the difference in the size and orientation of the petioles
between the central and peripheral parts of the trunk. In the central part, to
which the leaf-bearing stems are almost confined, the petioles are on the whole of
small diameter and have their vascular bundles orientated with regard to their
respective parent axes; viewed apart from their parent stems, therefore, the
