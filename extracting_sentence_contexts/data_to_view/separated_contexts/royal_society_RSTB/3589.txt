It is by no means
improbable that the large spaces between the loose sheath and the interseminal
scales (figs. 20, 22, 23, 26, etc.) are the result of the disappearance of loose tissues
such as Liagnrer, Sonms—Lauspacn, and WreLanp have described in the seed-
peduncles of Bennettitean strobili; but further reference is made to this possibility on
a later page. A reference to text-fig. 3, E, d, illustrates a common feature in the mega-
sporophylls, namely, the intimate association, and in some cases apparently organic
connection, between the loose cylinder of cells and the tissue of adjacent interseminal
scales. This fact, in conjunction with other features already alluded to, points to
an absence of a well-defined limiting layer in the pedicels of the ovules and reminds
one of the absence of a normal epidermis in the seed-peduncles of Bennettites.*

CoMPARISON WITH OTHER ‘l'yPEs. Bracts and Hairs.—The bracts of the Eathie species agree generally with those of
Bennettites Gibsonianus Carr, and B. Morierei (Sap. and Mar.), as also with the
corresponding structures in American examples of Cycadeoidea.
