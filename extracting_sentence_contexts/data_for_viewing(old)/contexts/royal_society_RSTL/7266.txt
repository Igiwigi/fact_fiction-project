most simple form. T have recently verified the existence of the identical equation just
referred to, and have obtained the expression for the factor M; and with the assistance
of this identical equation I have obtained the expression for the cubinvariant of the form

(1, 0, C, D, ELy, 1).

The expression for the quadrinvariant was, as already mentioned, given in the former
memoir: I find that the two invariants are in fact the invariants of a certain linear
function of U, H; viz. the linear function is =VU'U+ZO'H; so that, denoting by I*,
J*, the quadrinvariant and the cubinyariant respectively of the form

I*=T(U'U +4@'H),
1*=J(U'U+40'H),

we have

where T, J signity the functional operations of forming the two invariants respectively.
The function (1, 0, C, D, E'Ly, 1)', obtained by the application of TscnmNnavsrx's
transformation to the equation
