the type that occurs on the maxillule or on the maxille of adult Hstheriaâ€”tong, straight,
or slightly curved sete armed only laterally with setules. The two preparations which
we possess showing the maxilla are extremely good and show the bases of all the limbs
absolutely clearly for a considerable distance behind the mouth.

On the outer side of the maxilla of the larval Estherv is a well-defined papilla on
which opens the duct of the maxillary gland. An identical structure is to be found
on the maxilla of Lepidocaris, as first shown by ScouRFIELD (1926, p. 164).

The maxilla of the larval Conchostracan is thus not only totally different from that
of the adult, but is closely similar to that of an adult Lepidocaris. This can only
represent a definite case of recapitulation. Without going so far as to say that the
maxilla of Branchipus, of Sida, or of Lepidocaris is functionless, the fact of its minute
size and that we can see it disappearing in the Cladocera suggests, at least, that it is a
dwindling structure, and probably of little importance as a limb. Hence, that the
comparatively large and armed maxilla of an adult Conchostracan goes through this
simple but characteristic stage would appear purposeless unless it indicates that the
ancestor of the Conchostraca possessed such a degenerate maxilla. Now there is ample
evidence that the ancestral Crustacean possessed a maxilla of the typical biramous

type. The maxilla of typical Malacostraca and of certain Ostracods is of this common
type from which all Crustacean limbs can be derived. Hence, when the Branchiopods
were definitely established, the maxilla must already have dwindled to the simple type
such as occurs to-day in the Anostraca and Cladocera. In the Conchostraca, therefore,
and presumably in the Notostraca, since the maxille of these two groups are essentially
