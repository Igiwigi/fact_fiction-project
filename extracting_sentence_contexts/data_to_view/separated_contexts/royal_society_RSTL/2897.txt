Thence the amount of heat believed to be generated under
certain conditions is only comparative; but when, as in experiments made on many
Specimens collected together, a profuse perspiration breaks out among the insects,
the amount of temperature indicated by the thermometer introduced among them is
much lower than the real amount that has been produced. This was the case in the
present instance : the specimens were in a state of profuse perspiration, besides which
they had fasted about eighteen hours. These facts were further illustrated by a sub-
sequent experiment, in which eighteen specimens were employed in the same sized
phial; they were crowded together, and allowed to remain about a quarter of an
hour in a 8tate of great activity, until they became gradually weakened, were bathed
with perspiration, and were becoming quiet and asphyxiated with the carbonic acid
