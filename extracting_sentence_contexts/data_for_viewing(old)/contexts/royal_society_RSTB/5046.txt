case, for example, in the young Goniocidaris canaliculata, Lovin (1892, Plate 2, fig. 6),
where it is bounded by all five genitals. As it enlarges it becomes more and more circular
except along its junction with genital 3, where it remains almost straight (fig. 19, a-c,
also d). Very soon resorption sets in along the edge which is in contact with genital
1 and part of genitals 2 and 5, resulting in a narrow gap in this region (fig. 19, d).
Although resorption commences when the diameter of the test is only 0-6-0-7 mm.,
the sur-anal plate continues to increase in size, and even when the diameter has increased
to 2-5 mm. it still occupies the entire periproct except for the narrow gap. Then it
begins to recede from genitals 2, 1, 5 more rapidly. Soon a small additional plate is
laid down in the gap, and as this space increases in size more and more small plates
are laid down in it. Text-fig. 19, Â¢, shows two of these, but the sur-anal plate is still
contiguous with genital 3. Meanwhile the sur-anal plate is increasing in size (fig. 19,
a-c, shows three stages in the development of this plate), and owing to the fact that
the calcite is undergoing rapid resorption, the rim of the plate which is in contact with
genitals 2, 1,5, becomes thin and transparent (fig. 19, d and a). Then the margin itself
becomes jagged and the plate gradually assumes approximately the shape found in
the adult (fig. 19, c). It retains its connection with genital 3 for a long time, but as
more plates are laid down in the periproct it is ultimately separated completely from
the genitalring. However, even in the adult it remains in the neighbourhood of genital 3.

It has been stated that no trace of the adult anus can be seen before the urchin has
