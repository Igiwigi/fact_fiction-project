The mid-gut epithelium
in other Arthropods and, indeed, in all other Coelomates, is a derivative of the
endoderm. Its ectodermal origin among many insects, therefore, appears anomalous
at first sight. However, the fact that actual observations warrant no other conclusion,
at least in some insects, is undisputed. To attempt to bring about a forced unity is
perhaps not the best way of solving the question. Below are given the various modes of the origin of the mid-gut epithelium among
the Orthoptera and the Dermaptera :—

1—Ectodermal
AcRIDIDAE.—

Stenobothrus variabilis (GRABER, 1891, a).
