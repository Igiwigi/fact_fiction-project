Furthermore, if the shape of a : S
given line is accurately recorded as a function of the gas pressure, then line broadening and 22
shifting coefficients can be determined. When dealing with molecules of considerable importance : 8
for atmospheric and climate physics, accurate values of these parameters are necessary for gas DN
monitoring applications [3]. In fact, if the spectroscopic parameters of a particular line of a given : g
species are known (as a function of the gas temperature), then the absorber gas density can if

be accurately determined by using laser absorption spectroscopy [4]. This is a possible way to
determine the vertical profiles of water, carbon dioxide and other trace constituents of the Earth
atmosphere in air- or balloon-borne experiments through punctual (in sifu) measurements at
different altitudes [4]. In the Doppler regime, namely at low gas pressures, the main source of line broadening is the
Doppler effect.
