It will be observed that there is a very much larger proportion of total fat than
of total nitrogenous substance, in all the animals excepting the calf; that the per-
centage of nitrogenous substance diminishes, and that of the fat greatly increases, as
the animals mature ; also that the percentage of the total mineral matter decreases as
the animals mature. It is obvious that the increase during the fattening period will consist in still less
proportion of nitrogenous substance, and in still greater proportion of fat. In fact
the amount of fat stored up may be 8 or 10 times as much as that of the nitrogenous
substance ; and in the case of very fat pigs even more. The proportion of the total
mineral matter, like that of the nitrogenous substance, is alsÂ» much less in the
fattening increase of the animal, than in the entire body. Calculation further showed that the proportion of the nitrogenous 8ubstance of the
food which was finally retained was very small.
