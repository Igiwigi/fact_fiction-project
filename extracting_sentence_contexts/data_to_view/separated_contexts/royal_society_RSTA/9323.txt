The quantities within the brackets are extrapolation values. The following general conclusions may be drawn from the above facts :—

(1) That, in spite of the varying thermal effects obtained on diluting different
solutions, these effects may be expressed in a simple manner for the range over which
the solutions may be considered concentrated ;


DILUTION OF CONCENTRATED SOLUTIONS. 351

(2) That when the solutions become more dilute they, at the same time, become
more complex ;

(3) That those thermal changes occur in strong aqueous solutions, which suggest
that the solute is dissolved, not in water, but in some definite hydrate of the solute,
in general containing a large number of molecules of water. In special cases, however, such as that of acetic acid, the water molecules may be
few in number, while with nitric and hydrobromic acids the solvent becomes pure
water.

(4) That calcium chloride does not show the effect in so marked a degree, probably
because it is impossible to work with solutions of the same relative strength. Full facilities for the execution of this research have been most kindly afforded by
