The unit of the element
mercury, and the units of several other metals, such as zine, cadmium, and tin, s0 far as
our imperfect experience extends, appear to be analogous in this respect to hydrogen. But these are the only elements of this simple composition. The units of a second
group, of which the element oxygen, symbolized as £?, may be taken as a type, and to
which belong sulphur, 82, and selenium, a?, are composed of two identical simple weights,
and the facts of the science do not permit us to asxume these units as otherwise composed. Lastly, another group of elements appears in this system of a different and more complex
composition, to which group belong the elements chlorine «x?, bromine «{3?, iodine aw?,
nitrogen «?, phosphorus (2), arsenic («g?)?, and in all probability numerous other
elements. The simplest view which, consistently with the fundamental hypothesis (Sec.
