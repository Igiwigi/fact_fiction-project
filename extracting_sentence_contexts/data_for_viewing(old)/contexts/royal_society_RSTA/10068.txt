same temperatures was found to be nearly the same as those of the alloys, viz., (0037
(between 630° C, and 480° C., H = °43), although the mean permeability of the iron
was more than four times that of the meteoric iron and more than double that of the
nickel steel.

§8. The data 63 to 69, &c., nickel steel, show that the reversible fully magnetic
state of the material extends between the air temperature and 610° C. If the
heating is continued beyond 610° C.—for example to 640° C. as in 72—irreversible
effects are produced (shown by the magnetic behaviour on cooling). This is interesting
as showing that the change of internal structure begins below the temperature of
maximum permeability of the material as a whole. (Cf. Section IV., § 8, p. 63.)

The fact that the loss of magnetism is very gradual in nickel-iron alloys instead of
being very sudden as in nearly pure iron is clearly in accord with the theory of the
process by which the alloys lose their magnetism. In iron the temperature at which
the permeability becomes practically indistinguishable from that of the air is only a
few degrees above that at which dy/dé first becomes negative. In each of the alloys
there were about 130° C. between the aa temperatures. (Cf. Section V.,
§ 4, p. 69.)

§9. If the heating is interrupted at some temperature between that at which the
magnetism begins to disappear and that at which it has become inappreciable, and if
the temperature is then varied between this temperature and some lower temperature
above that at which the solution becomes labile (cf. fig. 26, III), the changes in the
amount of crystallisation can, as already explained, be represented graphically by the
