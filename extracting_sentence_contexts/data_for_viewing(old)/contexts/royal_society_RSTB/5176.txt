Typhlotriton spelaus of Missouri the eyes become concealed by the skin during
metamorphosis.

The Anura possess eyelids, both an upper and a lower (ventral) one, variously called the
nictitans or lower lid. It is of importance to notice that the nictitans invariably moves
from below upwards, and not horizontally or obliquely from the inner angle across the
eye, asis the case in all birds and many of the mammals. Moreover, the nictitans is more
or less transparent, or at least translucent, so that the details of the iris can frequently
be seen through it; but, on the other hand, it is never so thin as not to impair vision to
some extent. The nictitans is usually bordered along its free edge with pigment of a
brilliantly spotted bronze colour, but in some of the Hylide (eg., H. carulea) the
edge is bright green ; in fact, this ventral lid behaves like a lower lid and nictitans
combined. It may be remembered that in those sharks which possess a large nictitans,
the outside of this membrane is covered with the same kind of minute placoid scales, as
is the outer surface of the lower lid.

The Crocodiles have a well-developed typical nictitans, which moves obliquely
backwards and slightly upwards. It is so exceedingly transparent that all the details
of the iris can readily be seen through it. The free margin, which is slightly curved
and convex, is bordered by three or four narrow bands of brown pigment. These
animals often move the nictitans across the eye without closing the eyelids. In the
act of closing the eye the lids, or rather the lower lid, closes after the nictitans has
moved across the eye, and not simultaneously with it, as is the case in most other reptiles.
The upper lid in the adult has a thick tough fringe-like membrane, which is split at
