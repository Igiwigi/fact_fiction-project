which are densely aggregated.

Ganglionic layer (Plate 6, D)â€”This important formation attains a depth of 372 mm.
below the snperimposed stratum. The nerve-cells of this layer vary much in their con-
formation. The most frequent form assumed is that of an elongated pyramid, the apical
process of which can be traced often as far as the first layer of the cortex. Other cells
aszume the form of elongated spindles, and a frequent form is that of a horned cell,
which bears a striking resemblance to the egg cage of the Skate. The apex process
may bifurcate close to the cell, giving the latter the form of a horned pyramid, or it
may divide into two secondary processes of equal diameter at any distance up the third
layer. The apex process is particularly coarse and does not undergo rapid attenuation.
The average dimensions of these cells is 46 X 11p, a meagurement which reveals
clearly the elongated conformation of these elements, in fact, the oval and plump
rounded contour 80 frequent in the corresponding cells of Man, the Monkey, and
the Carnivora is very rarely met with in these animals. Occasionally a larger cell
than usual is met with, e.9., 65p X 23p. They contain an oval nucleus measuring
13p in length. These cells are disposed in oval or oblong nests, often covering an
area 460p deep by 110 broad, and contain as many as twenty cells in some situa-
tions. The cells are frequently scattered somewhad irregularly in the anterior portion
of the limbus, but they become progressively larger and more distinetly nested towards
the exposed portion of the limbic lobe. The clusters are frequently 80 closely packed
as to become confluent, and in many regions on this account the nests are badly
differentiated. It is impossible after close examination of this formation to arrive at
any other conclusion than that these cells nob only resemble those larger pyramids
of the third layer in Man in their general form, but also by their gradual increase in
