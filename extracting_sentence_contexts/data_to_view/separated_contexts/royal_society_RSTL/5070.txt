S After this d-tailed account of such a complicated system of visceral nerves, few
-Eperhaps will be disposed to doubt that we have here a true sympathetic nervous
Zayatem. The fact, however, of the existence of ganglia and intercommunicating
erves forming plexuses, the mode of dispoxition of these networks upon the organs,
-Ztheir connections with the principal nervous centres grouped around the cesophagus,
Zand lastly, the microscopic structure of both nerves and ganglia, all combine to prove
Sthe correctness of what we have advanced. S Assuming it, then, as proved that the system before us is a true sympathetic or
Splanchnic nervous system, let us now see what light this new fact is capable of
Ethrowing upon the physiology of the ganglia about the cesophagus.
