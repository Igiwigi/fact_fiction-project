neopallium is connected to the other hemisphere by means of the corpus callosum,
so that the ventral commissure of the Spiny Anteater represents not only the
anterior commissure, but also the corpus callosum of the Eutheria.” 4

It might be contended, however, that the fact of one animal receiving its cortical
supply from the middle cerebral artery, and of another from the posterior cerebral, is
not sufficient to allow it to be postulated that the cortices of the two are different in
character. This investigation, however, is concerned with the attempt to correlate the
vascular pattern with what is known of the morphology of the structure supplied ; and
the writer fully appreciates the need for caution in interpretation in a field which has
not previously been explored. The determination of the cortical fields of supply was
made by following the individual branches until they anastomosed with other arteries.
