Fluid accumulates in the tissues, but there is
no evidence that the kidneys fail in elimination, as a large amount of urine is found
in the bladder, and if the animal is removed to a dry or damp chamber, cedema is
drained off by this channel. 3. The fact that some cedema occurs in animals merely pegged and suspended in fluid
seems to indicate a change, probably vaso-motor, which causes increased absorption,
the same effect being produced, but to a greater extent, by the aconitines. This may
perhaps be best described as a reduction of a restraint upon absorption which is in
operation in the uninjured and unpoisoned animals. 4, Salt solution (7 per cent.)
