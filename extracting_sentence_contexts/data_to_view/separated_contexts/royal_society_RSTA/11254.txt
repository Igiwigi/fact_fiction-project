Could we
calculate the variability of the arrays of daughters due to individual mares, we
should probably get a better result for inheritance in the female line.*

The above result is so satisfactory that I have little doubt that we have deter-—
mined a very good value for oy/1 — p®. Substituting it we find for the correlation
between half-sisters :

The law of ancestral heredity gives for half-sisters r = ‘2, and 2? of this = ‘08. Thus we see that the collateral heredity between half-sisters, daughters of the
same sire, is quite sensible, and is almost what we might have predicted would be
the result, if we supposed correlation to be weakened, as in the previous cases, to
2 of its value by fictitious records. It is worth while to consider the amount of fictitious fecundity suggested by
the reduction factor 3. We have only to suppose the n,/N of our p. 277 to be 3.
