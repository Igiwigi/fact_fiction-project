thus to express the symbols of chlorine and nitrogen in every equation into which those
symbols enter; and if it were placed beyond doubt that the true density of chloride of
ammonium in the gaseous condition were 12:88, we might thus accept the fact and
assert that the factors x; and » were composite, 80 that either y=x? and »y=&%, or
y=c%% and y=1, and our view of the possible system of chemical substances, and of
rne laws of combination to which they were subject, would be profoundly modified. I

am far from believing that such is the true solution of this apparent anomaly. Such a
80lution, although not absolutely precluded to us, is in the highest degree improbable;
and the facts admit of an obvious and simple explanation on the hypothesis that chloride
of ammonium is decomposed, at the temperature at which its vapour-density is 8upposed
to have been taken, into equal volumes of hydrochloric acid and ammonia, of which very
satisfactory evidence has been given *.

(2) Again, the density of the binoxide of nitrogen is 14-989, as determined by experi-
ment. If this be correct, 2 volumes of binoxide of nitrogen are decomposed into 1 volume
of nitrogen and 1 volume of oxygen ; whence, putting «2 as the symbol of the
binoxide, a? as the symbol of nitrogen, and # as the 8ymbol of oxygen,
