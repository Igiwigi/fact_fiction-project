difficult to maintain, because determinism was no longer possible even in considering the
simplest individual quantum systems, such as those associated with elementary particles.
Following QM, such a representation or even a concept of how quantum phenomena come
about became in principle precluded in RWR interpretations. This made probability irreducible,


defined by quantum causality as probabilistic causality, and correlatively the arrow of events. QM,
nevertheless, found a way to use very abstract mathematics, such as that of Hilbert spaces over C,
to enable probabilistic predictions strictly in accord with what is experimentally observed, thus
still enabling QM and then QFT to remain mathematical-experimental sciences, with mathematics
playing an even greater role in them.

It is, however, rarely, if ever, noticed that the Galilean reduction is twofold, in fact threefold,
because the mathematical-experimental nature of modern physics is already predicated on the
double reduction. The first is defined by only dealing strictly with physical (rather than also
mental) reality; and the second is defined by a mathematical idealization of natural processes,
which requires disregarding those aspects of nature that cannot be mathematically idealized.
There is, however, a third reduction. It is based on disregarding the multiple realities of each
individual subject and considering only the single physical reality of nature, assumed to be
(ideally) representable in the same way for all subjects considering it, at least in doing physics.!>
This reduction is much more difficult, and perhaps ultimately impossible, except in relatively
simple cases, in psychology, cognitive sciences and decision science, or elsewhere in human
science, such as in economics, in short in any field expressly dealing with human thinking.

One can consider this situation in information-theoretical terms. The data considered in
