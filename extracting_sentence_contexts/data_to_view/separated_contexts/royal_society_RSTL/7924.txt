The ureters (d, d') are provided with thick walls, and become superficial in the 8econd
anterior fourth of the kidney ; they are perforated by only a few primary uriniferous
tubes; about half an inch before their termination they externally unite into a single
trunk, although they remain separate internally, the right entering the left close to the
single opening in the urinal cloaca (se Plate XL. fig. 2, &); this opening is round,
dorsad to the genital opening (g"), from which it is separated by a slightly raised wall
of the mucous membrane. The urinal cloaca (Plate XL. fig. 2, u) is 8mall, incompletely
separated from the termination of the rectum ; in fact it may be described as a dorsal
diverticle of the latter. The urine, consequently, passes by the vent. The kidneys are but sparingly supplied with blood from the arterial system, by a 8mall
vessel (1) which descends on the dorsal surtface of the intestine, and therefore is one of the
extreme branches of the arteria celiac.
