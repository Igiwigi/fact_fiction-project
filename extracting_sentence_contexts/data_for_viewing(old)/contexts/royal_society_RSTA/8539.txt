complicated. The final value for ¢’ to which we are led in this way is identical with
those mentioned below, though differently obtained, and we do not consider it necessary
to do more than outline this method in these few words. The result is, of course,
expressed in cylindrical co-ordinates (z, p), under the integral sign.

In the second method, we may calculate ¢’ on the axis p = 0, as in the penultimate
