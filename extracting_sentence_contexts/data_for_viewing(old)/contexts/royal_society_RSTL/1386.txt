which I answer, that in the decomposition of phosphoric fluids
every other ingredient but light may also return to the body
of the sun. And that. the emission of light must waste the
Sun, is not a difficulty that can be opposed to our hypothesis.
For as it is an evident fact that the sun does emit light, the
same objection, if it could be one, would equally militate
against every other assignable way to account for the phe-

There are moreover considerations that may lessen the pres-

from the sun cannot very sensibly lessen the size of this great
body. To this may be added, that, very possibly, there may
also be ways of restoration to compensate for what is lost by
the emission of light; though the manner in which this can
be brought about should not appear to us. Many of the ope-
