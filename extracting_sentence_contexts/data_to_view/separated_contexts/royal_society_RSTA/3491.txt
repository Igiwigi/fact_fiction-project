centim., so that each molecule present would have to pass backwards and
forwards between the filament and the cylinder some 10° times each second, This
seems to be an impossible feat for an uncharged molecule. Both these points of view lead to the conclusion that the corpuscles are not
produced by a dynamical action between the molecules of the surrounding gas and
the surface of the metal. In fact, all the experimental results seem to point to the
view that the corpuscles are produced from the metal by a process similar to
evaporation. The effect of the surrounding gas, of impurities in the wire, and of its
previous history are to be regarded as due to alterations in the property of the metal
which corresponds to latent heat in the theory of evaporation. ‘ The Edison Effect.
