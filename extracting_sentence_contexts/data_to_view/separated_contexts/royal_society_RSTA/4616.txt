Since v is a subsolution and q is a solution, it follows that for any 6 > 0,q — vis asupersolution. The positivity of q — 5v at t=o follows from the parabolic Hopf lemma, from which we infer the
existence of a constant 5(o) such that q/v > 5(o) uniformly over . Note that we have used the
fact that v(o, x) behaves like c x dist(x) near the boundary I" for some positive constant c. Thus
by the maximum principle, q — 6(a)v = 0 on [o, T). This implies

q(t, x) = 5(a) v(t, x) = CS(c) dist(x, I) et te [o,T),


which yields

_ Oq(t, x)
