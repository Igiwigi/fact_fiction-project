modulation of the non-centrosymmetric structural distortion. The disordered solid solution series
Sr}_,CayRuO3 of the isostructural perovskites SrRuO3 and CaRuO3 exists experimentally, and
is metallic and non-polar at all compositions, with the centrosymmetric Puma space group
(octahedral tilt pattern a+b~c) [35]. From x =0 up to x ~ 0.7, it is an itinerant ferromagnet with
Tc ~ 57K [13]. Above this value of x, the ferromagnetic order is suppressed.

Puggioni & Rondinelli showed using DFT calculations that inversion symmetry is broken
when the A-site cations are ordered in layers along the c-direction [11], while the magnetic and
metallic behaviour persist. Constraining the a and b lattice constants to be equal to mimic coherent
epitaxial growth, they obtained a Pmc2, space group, with the same tilt pattern as the Pnma of the
disordered alloy and an additional distortion corresponding to the polar > mode (shown in
figure 3a) of the parent P4/mmm space group. Interestingly, suppression of the polar [5 mode
caused a collapse of the ferromagnetic order [11]; we will use this fact to investigate the interplay
between polarization, magnetization and magnetoelectric multipoles.

Using the ground-state structure of the layered A-site ordered compound from [11], we
calculate the electronic and magnetic structure with spin-orbit coupling included. Within the
LDA, we obtain a magnetic moment on the Ru atoms of 0.1 up; this increases to 0.7 wg with
even a small U=0.5eV. Since the experimentally measured value for the magnetic moment
per Ru atom in disordered Sr,Ca,_,RuO3 with x =0.53 is below 0.2 4g [13], we do not apply
a Hubbard U correction in the following. We find that the magnetic dipole moments are oriented
in the orthorhombic b-direction, leading to the magnetic space group Pm'c2). Since the site
symmetry of the Ru atoms on Wyckoff position 4c in this space group is 1, all magnetoelectric
