By-and-by a state of continuous quiescence comes on,
during which the animal is not responsive to tentacular irritation, but remains 80 to
direct muscular irritation, giving one response to each direct stimulus. The tentacles
and polypite are much relaxed. In a sea-water solution just strong enough to taste
bitter, this phase may continue for hours ; in fact till a certain opalescence of the con-
tractile tissues—which it is a property of strychnia, as of most other reagents, to produce
—has advanced s0 far as to place the tissues beyond recovery. If the exposure to such
a solution has not been very prolonged, recovery of the animal in normal water is rapid. In a specimen exposed for 24 hours to such a solution, recovery began in half an hour
after restoration to normal water, but was never complete.
