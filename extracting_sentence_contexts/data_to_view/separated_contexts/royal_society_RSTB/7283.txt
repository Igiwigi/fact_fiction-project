diameter was collected towards the base of the mud at site 42B (at
290 cm.) ; sections showed the heterogeneous ray-cells characteristic of the genus Salix. In
the upper part of the gravelly-soil deposit of site 42B and again in the upper layers of the
lower peat (Carex-wood peat, site 42B) were smaller pieces of wood, also probably Salix,
but differing somewhat from that at the base of the muds. Associated with the latter material (i.e. Carex-wood peat of site 42 B) and also of the lower
part of the gravelly-soil were many bud-scales, which from their small size (c. 0-7 x 0:6 mm.
and others Â¢. 2:0 x 1-2mm.), rounded shape, and the fact that they were formed from
a single scale evidently also belong to some species of Salix. Similar bud-scales were also
found in large numbers in the Carex-wood layers of the lower peat in site 36 (2 to 14 cm.). 428 ANN P. CONOLLY, H. GODWIN AND ELEANOR M. MEGAW
