once that the maximum occurrences appear with sharp peaks in close agreement with
the calculated values.

The calculated lines for m> 4 are outside the observation region, but their
existence can be indicated by using the above links as sounders. At the same time,
in order to give more confidence in the application of the method, the similar linkages
are examined for the lines which are observed. It is, of course, understood that the
existence of a single link is no conclusive evidence of the existence of the unseen
line, as it may be a coincidence. The evidence is cumulative and is seen at a glance
in the diagram in Plate 8 (fig. 1). The actual data are given here. In the appli-
cation of this the frequent link modification must be allowed for, as well as the effect
of observation errors. Consequently separations deviating by not more than two
or three units from the values determined above are admitted. As a fact, this will
exclude a number of real link connections as well as inelude a certain number of
pseudo ones. But by limiting the deviations to these small amounts the conclusions
drawn will be more reliable.
