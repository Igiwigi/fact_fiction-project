My cabinet contains two other fragments, which I
believe belonged to it; but whether they did or not, the specimen is obviously
broken off abruptly at each end. As it is, we have seven verticils of pedunculated
strobili, two or three of which strobili only appear on the surface of the shale at each node. That this fructification has belonged to a different species of Asterophylites to Plate V.
fig. 31, appears from the fact that in the former all the strobili were pedunculate, whilst
in the latter most of the lateral ones are sessile. In this respect the latter plant seems to
resemble the Annularia densifolia figured by ExcnwainÂ®, which also agrees with the
Brooksbottom type in the presence of verticils of yery distinct scars, marking the points
from whence strobili have been detached. Fig.
