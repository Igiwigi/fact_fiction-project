If the plane of the latter were always kept parallel with the direction
of the wind, and ib were turned ab a rate proportional to the wind velocity, and at,
the same time the planes of the four others were placed in pairs respectively N. and S,,
E. and W., the latter would record the four corresponding components of the wind. M. VexTosA was led to this idea in 1878, after reading an account of Vox OrrTixGeN's
Integrating Anemometer, by the endeavour to obviate the sliding friction of that
instrument, The arrangement he 8uggests is per 8 incapable of performing other
mathematical operations than simple addition, and, in fact, is only one of the two
necessary but distinct features of the author's mechanism mentioned in the abstract
of the above paper (Proc. Royal Society, 1884, p. 191). M.
