problem by considering non-conservative game-type interactions between the individual agents.
An usual macroscopic model is derived in a high-frequency trading limit, leading to several
challenging open questions for the mathematical analysis along the way.


Another problem of social interaction that has received considerable attention is opinion 3 |
formation and in particular the way a group reaches consensus (e.g. [7]). A major idea is that in the

way of random meetings (discussions) of pairs they tend to agree (assimilate their opinion) if they
are already close or rather strengthen their opinion in a debate with opposite previous opinions.
This has led to novel kinetic and Fokkerâ€”Planck-type equations in domains of opinions [8,9].
A recent trend is to incorporate the heterogeneity of groups into models, in particular the existence
of certain opinion leaders that are trusted more than others. Besides the fact that now systems
have to be considered instead of single kinetic equations, the interactions naturally become
asymmetric, which complicates the mathematical analysis (e.g. [10]). In this issue, Albi et al. [11]
deal with such a problem, considering Boltzmann-type interactions with leaders also at the

microscopic level, and explaining how they can control opinion from the arising macroscopic 73
models. : 2
