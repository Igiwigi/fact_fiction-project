These factors are
very important for the problem of PAC by nanosecond discharges, as densities of hydrocarbons
and H20 molecules, absorbing UV-radiation efficiently, can be high in combustible mixtures. Finally, the rate of electron attachment increases significantly with gas number density. This
fact is illustrated by figure 9, where a characteristic time of attachment to oxygen molecule in air
is plotted for 3 and 5 atm. With pressure increase, the characteristic time of electron attachment
becomes comparable with duration of a nanosecond pulse. So, higher E/N values are necessary
to keep a given electron density when pressure increases.
