interaction—it involves only A and D, so only the records in A are relevant. By contrast,
equations (3.16), (3.17) could be satisfied equally well by orthogonality of the local state of S
alone or, indeed, of the global states of S.A. In other words, when one can access the composite
system AS, the condition that allows for reversible copying can be satisfied by the global state
even when it is not met by the record states of A alone [14]. Our next goal is to consider the effects
of more global copying operations.


4. Knowing of the record but not the outcome

Immediately above, in equations (3.18)-(3.20), we have insisted that the orthogonality condition,
Tr pea ps A — 0, should be satisfied ‘in the apparatus’, that is, that the apparatus eigenspaces that
correspond to the records should be orthogonal. This insistence stemmed from the fact that the
copying evolution 4p coupled only to A. However, one can imagine a situation where S(s_4)p
couples D to a global observable of SA. In that case, one might be able to find out that A ‘knows’
the outcome—the state of S—without actually finding out the outcome.

The simplest such example is afforded by a one qubit apparatus that measures a one qubit
system. The correlated—entangled—state of the two is then simply:

Wsa) =| tAr) +414 Ay), (4.1)

in obvious notation. Agent D can then detect the presence of the correlations established when S
and A interacted.
