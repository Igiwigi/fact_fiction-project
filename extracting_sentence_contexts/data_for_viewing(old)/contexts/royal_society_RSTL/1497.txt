these points, appear to me perfectly conclusive ; but as I never formed such an
opinion, as that 20 of oxygene were separated in the experiment, and never imagined
Such results as the combustion of iron and charcoal in ammonia, and never published
any thing which could receive such an interpretation, I shall not enter into any cri-
ticism on this part of his paper. The experiments of this ingenious chemist on the
direct decomposition of ammonia, scem to have been conducted with much care, except
as to the circumstance of his not boiling the quicksilver ; which I conceive has occa-
sioned him to over-rate the increase of yolume. At all events a loss of weight is tnore
to be expected than an increase of weight, in all very refined experiments of this kind,
1t is possible that the volume may be exactly doubled, and that the nitrogene may be
to the hydrogene as one to three ; but, neither the numerous experiments of Dr,
Hsney, nor those that I have tried, establish this; it is one of the hypothetical
inferences that may be made, but it cannot be regarded as an absolute fact.

moisture and ak ons visibly separated, cannot be conceived
to be as much as # or #; of the weight of the ammonia; 1
resolved to investigate more precisely, than'T had reason to
think had been hitherto done, the specific gravities of the
gasses concerned in their dry state ; and the very delicate
balance belonging to the Royal Institution, placed the means
of doing this in my power.
