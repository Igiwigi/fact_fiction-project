When f has reached this point f",
(at which the angle of incidence does not exceed that of emergence s0 much
as it had at first come short of it,) the rays again pass the glass free from
spherical aberration. If f be carried from hence towards the glass, or outwards from its original
place, the angle of incidence in the former case, or of emergence in the latter,
becomes disproportionately effective ; and either way the aberration exceeds
the correction. These facts have been established by careful experiment : they accord with
every appearance in such combinations of the plano-conyex glasses as have
come under my notice, and may I believe be extended to this rule ;—that in
general an achromatic object-glass, of which the inner surfaces are in contact,
or nearly 80, will have on one side of it two foci in its axis, for the rays
proceeding from which it will be truly corrected at a moderate aperture ; that
for the space between these two points, its spherical aberration will be over-
corrected, and beyond them either way under-corrected. I am not aware that an exception is to be made for any
quality of glass or curves that are likely to be used for the
microscope : but I apprehend a case may occur, if the flint
glass is convexo-concave and the convex lens united to its
concave side, that neither of the aplanatic pencils may con-
verge after trayersing the glass, and that their foci for a
radiant may be on opposite sides of it, the principle however
of the two foci remaining unaltered. To try this principle under a great change of cireum-
stances, and to prove in what manner it was applicable to
another most simple form of the object-glass, having made
a magnified tracing of the curyes of one of UTzsCHNEIDER's®,
and drawn a ray through it from its longer aplanatic focus,

which was ascertained after cementing the lenses ; I laid down a figure of the
flint lens inverted, and by means of the angles of the other diagram projected a
plano-convex = to be joined to its flat side, The new glass proved as achro-
matic as the original, though the single radius of the plano-conyex was more
than one-third longer than corresponded with the curves of the former double
convex lens: the two aplanatic foci showed themselyes as before ; the longer,
however, not in the place indicated by the ray drawn: but at a point F,
about two-thirds more distant from the glass, and from which both snrfaces
of the flint lens bent the pencil outwards ; the shorter focus F” too becoming
about half the length of the other, and the angle of incidence of its rays not
equalling that of their emergence.
