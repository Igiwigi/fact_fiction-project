primary tracheides show curious spiral lines of thickening between the series of pits.
Nothing of the kind is visible in H. Grievii or in the undetermined specimen. Only
a very slight formation of secondary wood has taken place in this specimen. The
cortex is of moderate thickness and has a smooth outer surface, so that the stem, as
a whole, has a cylindrical form, and is thus very different from the conspicuously
ribbed stem of H. Grievii. The comparison with the form of the stem in 1. tilieoides
is difficult, as the cortex is never complete in the specimens of the latter species.

The inner cortex contains masses of dark sclerotic tissue, arranged in vertical series
(see fig. 31), while the outer zone consists chiefly of sclerenchymatous fibres. There
is thus nothing peculiar in the structure of the cortex; its appearance is somewhat
unusual and suggestive of charring. The transverse section shows a fairly-preserved
pair of leaf-trace bundles (fig. 30, 7t.). The fact of their forming a pair suggests @ F
comparison with H. tiliwoides, though this arrangement is not absolutely unknown in
the other species. .

A tetrarch root of the type which we have referred to Heterangium, lies close to {
the stem opposite an interruption in the cortex. It is not unlikely that it may have
