symmetrically on opposite sides of the plane midway between the faces of the plate.
The effect of wiSi@ will be then merely to make the current stronger or weaker in
the middle of the plate than near the faces, and, therefore, to increase the apparent
resistance of the plate. We have already seen that unless P (assumed invariably to
be a scalar in this connection) be independent of the strain, SK~!0 is zero, so that the
whole expression on the right of equation (31) is zero. If, however, P be independent
of the strain, the term in VKH in equation (31) would indicate a Hatt effect. The
presence of SK~'@ in this term, however, serves to show that probably this is not
the true explanation of the Hatt effect.

The Hatt effect may be explained by saying that there is an electromotive force
hVKH, where h may be called the coefficient of the Hatt effect. It has been found
experimentally that this coefficient is by no means independent of TH—that, in fact,
in certain cases it changes sign when a definite strength of magnetic field is reached.
The above work indicates how, on the present theory, we may seek to explain such
an effect. For this purpose it must be remembered that equations (30) and (31) are
only true if g is the only term in # which involves H.

97. Let us now assume that the electric resistance is a function of H, and let us
incorporate in g the term of « thus depending upon H. We must add a term
— $KrK/2 to the former value of g; 7 being a function (of Class II. of § 9) of 8, ¥ and
H. For the sake of definiteness give 7 the form — bSHcH, where b, ¢ are functions
of the same classes as B and C respectively. Thus, as can be easily seen, to get
* or r” from r we have merely to change b, c and H into b’, c’, and H’ or b”, c”, and
H” respectively. Equations (84), (94), (18a), and (16a) must now be changed to
