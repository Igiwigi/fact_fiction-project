the time has come when WIL.LtAmson’s suggestion should be carried into effect.

We may take the generic character of Lepidostrobus, given by M. Zetiurr, as
fairly representing the modern conception of the genus. In the following literal
translation the italics are M. Zemusr’s own: “ Cones of fructification cylindrical,
oblong, or ovoid ; composed of a woody axis bearing sporangiferous bracts arranged
in a spiral, and somewhat crowded. Bracts formed of a narrow pedicel, usually
normal to the axis, and of a uni-nervate limb, lanceolate or linear-lanceolate in out-
line, generally erect, and often even applied to the surface of the cone. Sporangia
ovoid, solitary, fixed upon the superior face of the pedicel of the bracts.”t Of these
characters the spiral arrangement of the sporophylls is, perhaps, the least constant,
for M. Zermxer himself points out in the same work that in his Lepidostrobus Olryi
the phyllotaxis is verticillate. I therefore attach no importance to the fact that in
Spencerites the arrangement appears to have been variable in this respect.

In several points, however, the strobili described above diverge from the character
of Lepidostrobus. The form of the limb or lamina is totally unlike, and its preserva-
tion, especially in S. majusculus, is sometimes sufficiently perfect for us to be sure
that the difference is a real one. The sporangia are not ovoid, but approximately
spherical, and, which is the chief point, they are not fixed upon the superior surface
of the pedicel, but are altogether free from this part of the sporophyll, and only
attached, by a narrow base, to the lamina where it begins to expand. It is instruc-
tive to compare such a species of Lepidostrobus as L. Olryi, Zum. with our
strobili, In dimensions and general form LZ. Olryi appears to be not unlike our
Spencerites insignis, but, in the former, the attachment of the elongated sporangium
