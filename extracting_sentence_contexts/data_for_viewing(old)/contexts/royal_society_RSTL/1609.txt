magnets, were not the effects of it,

I do not propose at present to. give. these observations, as
it is my intention to: make a series on the precise effects of
changes of temperature in the magnets, s0 as to be able to
free the observations entirely from such effects, by reducing
them to the same standard. When this. is done, I shall no
doubt find, that the extent of the deviations which I haye ob-
tained require some correction, chiefly in the observations with
the needle out of the meridian ; andI likewise expect that here
the times of the maxima deviations will be found nearer to the
times, of the maximum. intensity and minimum intensity, as
determined by HANSTEEN ; but the leading fact, of the westerly
and easterly points approaching the north at the same lime, and
receding from it at the same time, during certain periods, will
remain unaltered. Thus the conclusions which I have before
drawn respecting, the increase and decrease of intensity in the


horizontal needle when under the influence of magnets. 391

terrestrial forces will not be materially affected by the changes
which may have taken place in the temperature of the mag-
nets during the times of observation. With regard to the
observations in the meridian, that is, with the needle pointing
