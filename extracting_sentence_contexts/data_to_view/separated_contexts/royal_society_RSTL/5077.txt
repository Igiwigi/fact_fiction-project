This vein ſubdivides, and
ramifies itſelf through the kidney-liver, the muſcles
and the ſpine ; but none of its branches communi-
cates with the aorta, The aorta on its part ſends
ſeveral branches into the kidney liver, very lender,
and reſembling, by their tranſverſal dire&tion, the
common emulgents, but very different in ſize. If then
the circulating force were placed at 9. it could only
produce an inverſe circulation, by the communica-
tion the cava might have by its capillary branches,
with the like ramifications of the aorta, which ſup-
poſition ſeems too much againſt nature to counterba-
lance the other opinion, which makes the trunk e,
of the aorta, a portion of the umbilical vein, and
the ſubſtitute of the heart. Another anatomical fact Proves this laſt opinion;
which is, that the aorta, and eſpecially the ſuperior,
F. ran up as high as the cranium, and was of a
pretty conſiderable ſize, while the venal trunk, d.
had nothing but capillary branches in the upper parts;
{o that it almoſt appeared evident that the veſſel, e. F,
was conneCted with the chief mover of the fluids. Wherefore, ſuppoſing the trunk, 9. to be the veng
porta, or an imperfe& cava going to ſome of the
viſcera, being the rudiments of an imperfect heart, or
a Vera-cava ending in a pouch, as the inteſtines did
which ſhould have entered the ſtomach, if there had
been one; thedifficulty almoſt diſappears, Ifay almoſt,
becauſe, evenonthis ſuppoſition, if there was a circula-
