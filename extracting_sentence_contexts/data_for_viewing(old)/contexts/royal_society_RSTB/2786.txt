But although many of them are now almost obliterated by the falling in of the root
and walls, it was found that wherever this has happened the limits of the floor are
sharply defined by the hard ossiferous deposit and the stalagmitic floor. In close
proximity there are caves still preserved containing precisely similar deposits.

The fauna of the caves is comparatively scanty, the only other important extinct
form besides the dwarf elephant and hippopotamus being a new species of Genet
(Genetta plesictoides).*

The remains of the pigmy elephant, Hlephas cypriotes, from Cyprus, with regard
to which a short note has already been published,t were all procured from a
single cave deposit situated on the southern side of the Kerynia Range. This
restriction is somewhat remarkable in view of the fact that there are several otherwise

similar deposits in the immediate vicinity, one small cave being only about 150 yards
distant. The teeth and mandibular rami of this species were present only in
small numbers but were associated with a large quantity of remains of H. minutus.
This deposit, like others found in the same locality, was evidently the floor of a
former cave of which but one original wall is still standing.

During the excavations made here many bones and teeth were found fractured ;
and that this had taken place subsequent to their accumulation on the floor of the
cave was proved by the parts of a bone or tooth being found in natural juxtaposition,
only falling apart when removed from the surrounding earth or rock. The opposing
