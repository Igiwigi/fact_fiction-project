tin-plate. This may easily be done by applying electric
cement to the circumference of the aperture, and then laying
the film of glass on it when properly melted. Let a delicate
air thermometer be placed opposite the disc of glass on one
side of the plate, and a heated iron ball opposite to the bulb
on the other. Let a current of cold air be made to play
constantly against the disc of glass, which will keep it uni-
formly below the temperature of the ambient air. Things
being thus arranged, the following facts will be observed.

* 15t. When the temperature of the ball is low, no sensible
effect is produced on the thermometer.

2nd. When the temperature of the ball is high, though
$till invisible in the dark, the effect on the instrument is very
considerable, even if the ball should be placed at a greater
distance than formerly.

Here we have two sources of heat, which, on account of
the change of-distance, would produce equal effects in the
naked bulb of the thermometer ; but, by the intervention of
