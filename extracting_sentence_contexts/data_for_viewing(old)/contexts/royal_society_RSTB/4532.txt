helped me considerably in my work on Acmopyle. In particular, I would like to
thank him for allowing me to reproduce in this paper a photograph (Plate 11, fig. 31),
of the stone of a new species of Podocarpus discovered by Prof. Compron in New
Caledonia.

The material of Aemopyle was originally preserved mostly in formalin, but was
subsequently transferred to a mixture of alcohol and glycerine. It consisted of
vegetative shoots bearing twigs with pectinately arranged leaves; a stouter piece of
stem with about twenty well marked growth rings; male cones in two stages of
development ; and over a dozen megastrobili. At the time of collection, March 10,
1914, the ovules had all reached the stage when they contain young embryos at the
ends of the tortuous suspensor tubes; they had evidently received the last year's
pollen. The fact that most of the male cones collected were nearly mature, suggested
that younger ovules (in a stage shortly before pollination) would also be present, but
there were none such in the material at my disposal. It is hoped that this
unfortunate gap will soon be filled up when more material becomes available.

Through the courtesy of the Director I obtained from the Royal Botanic Gardens,
Kew, some material of roots and leaves from two young plants growing in the
Temperate House. I would also like to thank Mr. L. A. Boonie for facilities to fix
this material at the Jodrell Laboratory.

Besides the two young plants at the Kew Gardens there is another at the
Glasnevin Garden, Dublin, from which, through the great kindness of the Director,
Sir F. Moore, I received a fresh twig which has been very useful for comparison.
