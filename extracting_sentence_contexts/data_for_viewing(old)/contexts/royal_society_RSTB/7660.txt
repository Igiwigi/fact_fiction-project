In some species (pig, dog, rabbit) the arteria anastomotica or its homologue appears
to be a branch of the external ophthalmic artery, whereas in other species (sheep, goat, ox)
the latter vessel seems to be a branch of the former. This suggests that the common trunk
of these two arteries, which arises from the internal maxillary artery at approximately the
same level in all species, is a homologous vessel. In the cat the site of this common trunk
is occupied by the carotid rete, and thus no one vessel can be identified as an external
ophthalmic artery; the tissues which in other species are supplied by the latter vessel
receive their blood supply from several vessels which arise from the carotid rete. It may
be that the main stem of the external ophthalmic artery has been replaced by the rete, and
that consequently the peripheral orbital and ethmoidal branches frequently have their
roots in this structure. In the rat the so-called supra-orbital division of the stapedial artery
arises from the stapedial artery at the apex of the orbit and has a distribution similar to
that of the external ophthalmic artery of other animals (figure 9). In fact, as will be shown
later, it is probably a true external ophthalmic artery.

The site of origin of the peripheral vessels supplying the orbito-ethmoidal region was
found to vary frequently in the cat, and also, though much less commonly, in the other
species. In the latter the variations seen consisted merely of a shift of the origin of the
branches along the main trunk of the external ophthalmic artery. In the cat, however,
possibly due to the presence of a rete at this site, the origin of the vessels which correspond
to the external ophthalmic artery was found frequently to be transferred to adjacent
vessels, The great variability in the vascular arrangements of this system in the cat suggests
that a definitive pattern has not yet been established in this animal.

An interesting feature of the cranial vessels of the cat is the formation of a single nasal
