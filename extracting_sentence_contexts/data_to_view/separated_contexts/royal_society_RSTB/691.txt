Renautr had then furnished (‘Fossil Botany,’ English translation,
p- 258). My specimens, now described, certainly support the Count Sorms’ conclu-
sions on each of these points. So far from the parichnoid organs supplying any
evidence of generic, much less of class, differences between Sigillaria and Lepidoden-
dron, the fact that the two genera alike possess these very remarkable and unique
structures affords a strong additional proof of their close relationship. In fig. 87 we find that the vertical section has passed through the curious adenoid
organ at h, Had the section been made nearer to the base of the leaf, this would not
have been the case. Both the central mass and the walls of the cavity in which that
mass is lodged present the charred aspect so characteristic of this structure.
