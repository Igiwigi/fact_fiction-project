The modification of this method
suggested by Prentiss (1903) was then tried. Material fixed in sublimate was
sectioned, and the sections molybdenated on the slide, differentiated, and stained
with toluidin blue. This method yielded better results ; in fact, the preparations so
made showed the neurofibrille in some of the giant fibres, but they were much less

satisfactory in regard to the fibrillee in the giant cells. It then occurred to me that
possibly the material fixed and treated by Berurâ€™s method, in which, therefore,
the affinity for stains of the cytoplasmic granules had been suppressed, might afford
a better chance of obtaining differentiation of the neurofibrille on staining with
iron-hematoxylin, and such proved to be the case.
