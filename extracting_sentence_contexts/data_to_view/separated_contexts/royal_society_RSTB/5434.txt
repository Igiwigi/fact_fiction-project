RipEwoop was unaware of what ultimately happens to the
rectangular cartilage below the notochord, for he says, “‘ What is the ultimate fate of
this ventral cartilage of X enopus I cannot say, since I have no late larve of the genus
in which to study its subsequent history.”

ScHAINSLAND (1906), whose work is merely a compilation, adds nothing more than
the above statements. It has already been stated that, outside the notochordal sheath, the sclerotomic cells
form a fibrous tube-like structure. Support to this has been given by EMELIANOFF
(1925), who worked on Rana esculenta and Pelobates fuscus, but who failed to observe
either the moniliform notochord, or the fact that this fibrous perichordal tube follows
the moniliform structuré of the notochord outside. The vertebral (centrum) regions
are constricted, and the intervertebral regions are dilated, so that in the vertebral
region, especially at the dorsolateral corners of the notochord, the perichordal layer of
the tube is very thin. Outside this thin layer of perichordal tube there form, on the
two dorsolateral corners, aggregations of sclerotomic cells to form the dorsal arcualia,
The cause of the thinness of the fibrous perichordal layer on the two dorsolateral corners
is quite obvious ; it is the pressure exerted by the aggregation of the sclerotomic cells
which form the dorsal arcualia.
