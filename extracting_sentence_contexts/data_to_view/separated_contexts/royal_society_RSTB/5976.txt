and so it
finally came to supersede the old. That, then, is our idea of how the substitution of the more complex type of placenta
for the simpler ancestral type may have been accomplished. We must leave it to the
advocates of the simplification-hypothesis to find another explanation of the facts
established by us, and to indicate more precisely from what variety of hemochorial
placenta they consider the process of simplification to have started. By most authorities

the Lemurs are regarded as members of the Order Primates, and one would naturally
suppose that their simplified placenta was derived from such a deciduate type as is
found in the more primitive members of the Order, but in that event we should have to
imagine the connecting stalk retracing its steps and re-acquiring its ancestral free
vesicular condition, in defiance of any such Law as that of the Irreversibility of Evolution
(Doxto).
