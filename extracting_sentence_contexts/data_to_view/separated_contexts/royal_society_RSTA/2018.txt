Hence if the two limits are the same
24104'89 (i.e., put €= —'19), the mantissa is larger by 49A,—73,+'°51+3'42p. It is
satisfied by p=—‘14 or d\= ‘002. But it is possible that these F are due to
independent groups, ie., that the sequence of the second series also depends
on a whole multiple of A, This cannot happen unless the two limits are
different, which in fact seems to be the general rule. If the limit is displaced
by yd, € is 3°617y/44°25 = 082y, and the mantissa difference from 49A, is now

8R3
