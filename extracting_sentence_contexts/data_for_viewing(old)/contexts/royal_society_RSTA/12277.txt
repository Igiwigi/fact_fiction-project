THE MECHANICAL EQUIVALENT OF HEAT. 393

Tt should be noticed that on the above dates we were constantly passing currents
through the coil in order to adjust the temperature of the calorimeter during our
stirring experiments. As, however, there was but little current when ascertaining
the resistance of the wire at different temperatures, the: curves were not appreciably
altered, and we did not recognize the fact that the rise was a consequence of the
current.
On August 27, we performed one of our “J” experiments. We then had
a current of about half ampére passing through the coil for about 14 hours. We
had determined the resistance at the commencement of the experiment, and, on
Gepeating our observations at its close, we found that the value of R had risen from
0-556 to 10°560. It would thus appear that the rise was a function of the current
gather than of the time. We continued the series of experiments until September 1,
Shen we decided to abandon the use of this alloy.* The labour thus expended was
wot altogether lost, for, as will be explained, in the section on the measurement
“of temperature, the results were of considerable value to us.
~ Had the rise been a function of the time it would not have been so disastrous, since
ge could have deduced the resistance during each experiment. As, however, the
