At. M, there is a small opening of but
little extent; above and below which, and the fissures marked
K and L, as well as the cave marked G, H, I, there is no
apparent opening to lead to the surface, more than what I
have mentioned in my description of sketch No. 1 ; but what
may be produced in quarrying farther on I cannot tell, though
I 5hall not fail to take notice as the quarry proceeds. The height of this quarry to the surface at N,is 110 feet ;
and this part of the quarry is 400 feet distant from the cave A,
in sketch No. 1, and is in fact part of the same quarry. Professor BucKLAND and Mr. WARBURTON have examined
the Oreston quarries and caves that contained the bones, and
they also found some themselves.
