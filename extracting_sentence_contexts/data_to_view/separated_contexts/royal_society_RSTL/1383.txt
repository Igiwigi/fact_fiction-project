For the
same reason the horn of the rhinoceros; being'merely a mass
of compacted' hair=like fibres, has-never'been-found fossil in
gravel beds with the bones"of that-animal;'nor does\it occur
in the cave at Kirkdale.'' I have beer told that sheeps? horns
laid'on land for manure will be consumed- in'+ten -or-a-dozen
years; the calcareous matter of |bone- being'nearly allied to
lime-stone, is the only' portion of animal bodies that occurs in
a fossil state,” unless' "when preserved,/like the Siberian ele-
phant, of the same'extinct/species with that of Kirkdale, by
being frozen in ice, or buried/in peat. The extreme abundance of the' teeth-of water rats has also
beenalluded'to;'and though'theidea of hyenas' eating rats may
appear ridiculous; it'is\consistentwith'the omnivorous appetite
of modern hyznas ;nor is'the'disproportion in size of theani-
mal to that of its prey, greater 'thaw'that of wolves /and-foxes,
which are supposed- by Captain” Parry to'feed 'chiefly''on
mice during 'the long winters of Melville Island. -Our-largest
dogs eat rats and mice; jackalls-occasionally-prey'on mice,
and dogs and' foxes will eat-frogs.” It is probable, there-
fore, that neither the* size'nor aquatichabit-'of the water
rat would secure it from the/hyeznas.”''They might occasion-
ally also have eaten” mice; 'weasels; rabbits,” foxes, wolves,
and birds ; and in masticating/the bodies of these small ani-
mals with their coarse conical teeth, many bones and frag-
ments of bone would. be pressed outwards through their lips,
and fall neglected'to the ground. The occurrence of birds* bones may be explained by the
probability of the hyznas finding them dead, and taking them
home, as usual, to. eat in their den: and the fact, that four
