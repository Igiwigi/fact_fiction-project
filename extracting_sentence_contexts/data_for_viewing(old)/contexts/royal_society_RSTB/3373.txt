large arteries, and were of no use.

Of the green colours, naphthol green has proved to be a firm colour which does not
wash out; it is used in the proportion of

Naphthol green, 4 drachm [2 grammes}. Glycerine, 2 fluid drachms [7 ¢,¢,],

Rub into a smooth paste, and add a hot solution of gelatine (of strength of 2 ozs,
to 1 pint) sufficient to make 1 pint as before.

The red, blue, and green are quite stable colours, and do not colour the hardening
fluid at all; the yellow has caused the most difficulty, not only from its liability to
wash out, but also from the fact that yellow most resembles the natural colour of the
uninjected cerebral substance.

With regard to the question of the fixation of the colours, I have found that if the
solid gelatine mass, coloured with carmine, Nicholson’s blue, or naphthol green, be put
into cold water, the colour is dissolved out; but after this gelatine has heen put
into the formaline mixture used for the hardening, the colours become fixed and do
not wash out in water. In the case of gelatine coloured by yellow and brown, it was
found that if alum be added in the proportion of 2 ozs. of a saturated solution of alum
to a pint of the formaline solution (i.e., 1 to 10), these colours are more permanent,

In making an injection, the smaller pressure bottles in connection with the arteries
of the brain and the brain itself were immersed in a large basin of water at 40°-50° C.,
