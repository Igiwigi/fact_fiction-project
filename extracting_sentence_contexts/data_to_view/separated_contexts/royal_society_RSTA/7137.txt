A ~—-We note that the level of the North Sea as a whole was falling, so conditions were not
steady; also because of the unlimited supply of water which is available from the ocean,
we must expect the gradients near the northern entrance normally to be smaller than the
theoretical gradients in a steady state. In the Flemish bight the gradients were west to east, and the water which earlier had been
piled up near the Wash had travelled south and was producing a maximum disturbance of
over 4ft. in the Thames Estuary. The fact that a piling up of water on the east coast from winds well to the north can travel
southwards as in the present example is a matter of some importance in the prediction of

storm effects in the Thames Estuary. Vol. 242. A. 67
