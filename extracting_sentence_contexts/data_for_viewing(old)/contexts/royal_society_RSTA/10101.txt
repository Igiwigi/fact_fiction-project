From the first fraction there was recovered 0°0113 gramme AgCl, equivalent to
00091 Ag,O; from the second fraction 0°0567 gramme AgCl. It appears, therefore,
that about half the residue consisted of silver chloride, whilst the remaining part
contained sufficient oxide and sulphide to give the precipitate a black colour, and so
disguise to a large extent the chloride which was its chief constituent.

G. Striation of the Deposit.

It was noticed very early in the investigation that high values for the electro-
chemical equivalent were almost invariably accompanied by a characteristic striation
of the deposit, whilst normal equivalents were almost always obtained from unstriated
deposits with currents of 1 ampere; it was in fact possible to guess roughly what the
weight of the deposit would be by noting the appearance of the silver deposited in
the bowl. The impurity which causes the high values is evidently characterised by
the property of producing marked striations, and this property was for some time the
only qualitative test for the presence or absence of the substance in the silver
solutions. It was also considered to be of importance in seeking to determine the

nature of the impurity ; thus if high values could be obtained with a variety of added
impurities, that one which most readily gave striated deposits was the most likely to
be the characteristic impurity of the actual solutions used for electrolysis.
