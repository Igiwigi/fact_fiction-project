5600 yellow-green very pale blue-green
5400 green pale blue-green
4800 blue-green no change
4300 blue grey-blue
4100 violet neutral tint

Except for red (6500 A) and blue-green (4800 A), which undergo no observable change,
any of the colours could have been employed for testing the replacement of one type of vision
by the other. Two changes seemed to be particularly noticeable: that undergone by yellow,
which becomes white or pale grey; and that undergone by violet, which becomes neutral tint.
When colour filters and coloured cardboard were tested, it was found that the colour changes
which they suffered, owing to reduction of visual angle, were substantially the same as
those for monochromatic colours given above (in table 17). This fact, coupled with the
knowledge that, as mentioned above, the fringes produced by chromatic aberration are not
themselves composed of monochromatic rays, justified their use in these experiments.


540 H. HARTRIDGE ON THE

It should be emphasized that there is nothing critical with regard to these experiments.
The size of the pupil, the intensity of illumination of the test object, and its depth of tint,
as will be shown in the sections which follow, all affect the visual angle at which full colour
vision is replaced by reduced colour vision, and vice versa (see § 22). For this reason the
experiments always consisted of comparisons in which, so far as possible, only one variable
was changed at a time. ; : ‘
