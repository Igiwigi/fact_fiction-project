Independently of the cireumstance that neither of these formulze for y and -
provides for the case when « is negative or impossible, and that neither [3] nor
[4] provides for the case when y is impossible, their incompleteness will appear
from what follows.

That [2] is incomplete is prima facie obvious, from the known fact that
when z is a rational fraction, a* has as many values as there are units in the
denominator of z reduced to its lowest terms, whereas [2] neyer exhibits more
than one yalue.

Thus, &* (e being the Neperian base and 1e = 1) has two values, viz: +,/e
and —,/e, whereas

represents the value + /e only.

The imperfection of [3] and [4] arises from the imperfection of [2], of which
[3] and [4] are reverted solutions.
