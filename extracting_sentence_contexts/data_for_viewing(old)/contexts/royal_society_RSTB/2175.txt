adding an acid to this solution sp. 5 is obtained, which is again very like sp. 7. On
examining the contents of the gut which yielded these results microscopically, I
found diatoms and vegetable débris, but I could not detect the peculiar granules of
Cheetopterin which Professor LANKrsteR found in the intestinal epithelium, and
which he supposes are the forms in which Cheetopterin occurs in the latter. | Hence,
then, there is a most remarkable agreement between Cheetopterin and the food eaten
by the worm, as far as the pigments are concerned. The impression left on the mind
of an observer is that Cheetopterin is taken up into the intestinal epithelium from the
chlorophyll in the gut directly, being, however, changed a little in the epithelial cells.
Of course the alternative is that the pigment found in the intestine is excreted into
it, but the amount of pigment found in the gut is very much greater than can be
accounted for by this hypothesis. Looking now at Professor LANKEsTER’s drawing
(fig. 2, Plate 34 of his paper) one is at once struck by the fact that the pigment occurs
in those parts of the cells which are nearest to the lumen of the intestine. I have myself
prepared several preparations showing this, but I also find Cheetopterin staining the
protoplasm of the epithelial cells and dissolved in oil globules.* That is, we find the

pigment as we should expect to find it if absorbed from the intestine.

* There are other appearances which suggest the presence of cells recalling to mind the ferment cells
of the gastric gland; these I have not yet studied,
