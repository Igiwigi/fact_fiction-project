It was after reading Sir W. Tros0N's paper three or four years ago, that I made a
list of all the suitable integrals of the form

that were given in Professor Ds IAaax's © Nouvelles Tables d'Int6grales definies'


MR. J. W. L. GLAISHER ON THE THEORY OF ELLIPTIC FUNCTIONS. 497

(Leyden, 1867), and deduced therefrom the resulting identities. The only formuli 0
obtained which appeared of interest were, in fact, those which are given in the present
paper, viz. (18) to (23); but at the time I was not aware of their connexion with the
theory of Elliptic Functions. It was only recently, after obtaining the values of
8n am  &c. in (10) to (17), that I remarked that the resulting identities were the same
as those which I had previously deduced by the aid of Sir W. Tnowsox's principle.

It was shown by CAyLEY at the end of Sir W, Tnows0x's paper that the identity (28)
corresponds to

®(ui, =, /(L)o*® Ha+K', =); 6 vert 20)

and it is singular that all the identities that follow from the method of this section thus
appear to correspond either to elliptic or theta-function transformations. Speaking
