Sin assigning to Man an appearance at such a period, it would of necessity imply his
2oxistence during long ages beyond all exact calculations ; for we have been apt to place
Deven the latest of our geological changes at a remote, and, to us, unknown distance.
Lhe reasons on which such a view has been held have been, mainly,—the great lapse
pf time considered requisite for the dying out of s0 many species of great Mammals,—
She circumstance that many of the smaller valleys have been excavated since they lived,
-Z—the presumed non-existence of Man himself,—and the great extent of the later and
Znore modern accumulations. But we have in this part of Europe no succession of
Strata to record a gradual dying out of the species, but much, on the contrary, which
points to an abrupt end, and evidence only of relative and not of actual time; while
Zhe recent valley-deposits, although often indicating considerable age, show rates of
Zowth, which, though variable, appear, on the whole, to have been comparatively rapid.
Zlhe evidence, in fact, as it at present stands, does not seem to me to necessitate the
Sarrying of man back in past time, 80 much as the bringing forward of the extinct
Animals towards our own time; my own previous opinion, founded upon an independent
Study of the superficial drift or Pleistocene deposits, having likewise been certainly in
Faxour of the latter view. There are numerous phenomena, which I can only consider
Cop evidence of a sndden change, and of a rapid and transitory action and modification
Sof the surface, at a comparatively recent geological period—a period which, if the
eoregoing facts are truly interpreted, would seem nevertheless to have been marked,
before its end, by the presence of Man, on a land clothed with a vegetation apparently
very similar to that now flourishing in like latitudes, and whose waters were inhabited
by Testacea also of forms now living ; while on the surface of that land there lived
Mammalia, of which some species are yet the associates of man, although accompanied
by others, many of them of gigantic size, and of forms now extinct.
