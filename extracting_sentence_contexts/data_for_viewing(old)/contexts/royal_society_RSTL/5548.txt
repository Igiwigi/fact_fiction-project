where the numbers in the last line are the numbers in the column bed of Table VI(a).
The partition 2*1, considered as containing a part zero, gives, when the parts are success-
ively increased by 1, the partitions 321, 2, 2*1?, in which the indices of the increased
part (7. e. the original part plus unity) are 1, 3, 2; these numbers are taken as multi-
co of the coefficient 1 of the partition 2*1, and we thus have the new coefficients
1, 3, 2 of the partitions 321, 2, 2*1*. In like manner the coefficient 3 of the partition
21* gives the new coefficients 3, 6, 12 of the partitions 31*, 2*1?, 21*, and the coefficient
10 of the partition 1* gives the new coefficients 10, 60 of the partitions 21* and 15, and
finally, the last line is obtained by addition. The process in fact amounts to the multi-
plication separately of each term of cd=
1(2?1)+3(21*+10(1*)

by 6=(1). It would perhaps have been proper to employ an analogous rule for the
calculation of the combinations &d”.. not containing 6, but instead of doing s0 I ayailed
myself of the existing Tables (5). But the comparison of the last line of each Table (a)
(which as corresponding to a combination 4” was always calculated independently of the
Tables (6)) with such last line as calculated from the corresponding Table (6), seems to
afford a complete verification of both the Tables; and my process has in fact enabled me
to detect seyeral numerical errors in the Tables (6), as given in the English translation
of the work above referred to. It is not desirable, as regards facility of calculation and
independently of the want of verification, to calculate either set of Tables wholly from
