water was 0052 gramme in eleven days, which gives 0:005 gramme in a single day.
Albumen, then, appears to be about 24 times less dialysable than gum, and 1000 times
less 80 than chloride of sodium.

Even combination with an alkali does not appear to enable albumen to pass through
the colloid septum. To half a gramme of pure albuminic acid dissolyed in 50 grammes
of water, *05 gramme of hydrate of soda was added (one-tenth of the weight of the
albumen), and the liquid was placed upon parchment-paper. No albumen could be
discovered in the diffusate of several days, but it gave +069 gramme of carbonate of
80da, equivalent to +053 gramme of hydrate of soda; that is the whole soda originally
Faded to the albumen. The separation of the soda from the albumen may possibly have
Heen aided by the presence of carbonic acid in the water, but certainly the entire separa-
fon of the alkali from albumen by diffusion through a colloidal film is a remarkable fact.
Fydrate of potash was found to diffuse away from albumen in the same manner.
= A solution of Znwulsin is precipitated by albuminic and gummic acids, but not by
Wpurified albumen or gum-arabic. The precipitates are white and opaque, pulverulent,
ad not gelatinous. They are soluble in acetic acid,

Z A thin stratum of pure albumen coagulated by heat appears to intercept completely
Si passage of liquid albumen of the egg. Forty grammes of undiluted egg-albumen,
Epresenting 5:6 grammes of dry albumen, were placed on a dialyser of the small size,
-Emposed of two sheets of calico well-impregnated with albumen and coagulated by
Foat of steam, as in the albumenized osmometer*. After twelve days the volume of
Bquid within the instrument had increased to 117 grammes by osmose, while a diffu-
Mte had passed through the dialyser of 0-243 gramme, or 4:34 per cent. of the original
