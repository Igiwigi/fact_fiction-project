Daecrydium. Tn accordance with this view he regards as a case of recapitulation the
resemblance between the final stage of Podocarpus and the young stage of D. colensoi
and D. intermedium, in which the ovule is inverted and the epimatium overtops the
integument (Stnnort, p. 49).7

However, it has long been known through the work of SrrasBurGER (1872, Plate 2,
figs. 39) and of Banton (1873, Plate 8) that the ovule of Podocarpus chinensis
executes during development a movement in the opposite direction, namely, from a
nearly horizontal to a completely inverted position, Srres (1912, p. 470) records a
similar movement in P. latifolius, and Miss Gress’ photograph (1912, fig. 79) of a
comparatively young ovule of P. elata leads to the same conclusion.

These facts about Podocarpus are not here cited as reminiscences of a daerydioid
ancestry ; but they at least indicate the uncertainty attending the interpretation of
the juvenile stage of Dacrydium.

As regards the posture of the young ovule of Acmopyle a definite statement is
naturally at present out of the question, but even if it is found to be inverted, it
would be difficult to argue that the sub-erect position of the ripe seed is the
expression of a dacrydioid affinity, for in the only other points in which Aemopyle
departs from Podocarpus it does so in a direction opposite to that of Daerydium. As
already concluded above from a consideration of the epimatium the three genera
probably form a linear series with Podocampus in the middle ; the nearly erect position
of the seed of Acmopyle is therefore probably to be regarded as a recent secondary
acquirement. If the reduction theory is to be maintained—a view to which I do not
