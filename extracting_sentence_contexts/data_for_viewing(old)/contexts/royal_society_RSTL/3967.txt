one the alkalescence arises from volatile alkali, and in the other from fixed alkali.
In the first it is caused by carbonate of ammonia, and in the second by carbonate of
80da, or potash, or alkaline phosphate of s0da. Decomposition of urea is the origin
of the one, and disordered secretion of the other.

Whenever alkalescence arises, the earthy phosphates, whatever their quantity, are
generally precipitated ; and hence the expression phosphatic diathesis, a term which
makes no distinction between the different kinds of alkalescence, nor between cases
in which the earthy phosphates, sometimes far below their average quantity, simply
appear in consequence of their insolubility in alkaline fluids, and cases in which a
vast excess of earthy or alkaline phosphates is being excreted.

The object of the present. paper is to point out the fact and the value of the distinc-
tion between the different kinds of alkalescence.

M. PzLovze has shown how rapidly decomposing mucus effects the conversion of
urea into carbonate of ammonia. Irritation of the mucous membrane may give rise
to mucus which produces this change, and in consequence the blue colour will be
restored to reddened litmus paper if dipped into urine containing such mucus ; or if
