and storage (CCS) technology involves continued fossil fuel use but is nonetheless described by
the UK Climate Change Committee as a ‘necessity’, due to it being a leading option to decarbonize
heavy industries like cement and steel and to manufacture carbon-free hydrogen fuel. However,
there are projects now taking shape in Europe, the US and elsewhere that are doing what the
experts recommend to bring costs down, such as working in industrial clusters and sharing
infrastructure.

The role of the global food system in climate change is another familiar theme. There is
increasing realization that GHGs are released by land-clearing, livestock, transport, processing
and waste. But how many people know that food is estimated to account for a one-third of all
human-generated GHG emissions [7], more than electricity generation? [8]. It is not the role of
researchers to dictate eating habits, but they can point out, as they do here, the objective scientific
fact that eating less meat and more plant-based food, where affordable, is good for both people
and the planet.

Other solutions are not so well documented, but are nonetheless potentially game changing.
Digital technology is often depicted as a source of GHG emissions, from web streaming and data
centres, when in fact it also has enormous potential to save GHG emissions. Machine learning is
already used to simulate and optimize industrial operations, such as wind farms or factories—
using so-called ‘digital twins’. The same principle could be used to minimize emissions from


a plant, sector or city—ultimately scaling up to ‘a control loop for the protection of the planet’
analogous to randomized control trials.
