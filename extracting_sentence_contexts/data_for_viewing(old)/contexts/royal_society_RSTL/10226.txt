The whole sheabh is still invested by a very distinet membrana elastica externa (m.el),

The changes which have taken place in the parts which form the permanent vertebra
will be best understood from Plate 28, figs. 69-71. From the transverse section (fig.
70) it will be seen that there are still neural and hemal arches resting upon the
membrana elastica externa ; but longitudinal sections (fig. 69) show that laterally thess
arches join a cartilaginous tube, embracing the intervertebral regions of the notochord,
and continuous from one vertebra to the next.

It will be convenient to treat separately the neural arches, the hemal arches with
their appendages, and the intervertebral cartilaginous rings.

The neural arches, except in the fact of embracing a relatively smaller part of the
neural tube than in the earlier stage, do not at first sight appear to have undergone any
changes. Viewed from the side, however, in dissected specimens, they are seen to be
prolonged upwards 80 as to unite above with bars of cartilage directed obliquely back-
wards. An explanation of this appearance is easily found in the sections. The carti-
laginous neural arches are invested by a delicate layer of homogeneous bone, developed
in the perichondrium, and this bone is prolonged beyond the cartilage and joins a
similar os8eous investment of the dorsal bars above mentioned. The whole of these parts
may, it appears to us, be certainly reckoned as parts of the neural arches, 80 that at
this stage each neural arch consists of : (1) a pair of basal portions resting on the noto-
chord consisting of cartilage invested by bone, (2) of a pair of dorsal cartilaginous bars
invested in bone (7.0'.), and (3) of osseous bars connecting (1) and (2).
