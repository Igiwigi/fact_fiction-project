3. The hierarchy problem and the need for new physics

(a) The UV sensitivity of the Higgs mass

With the addition of the Higgs boson, the SM is now theoretically consistent at the perturbative
level a priori up to very high scale, possibly the Planck scale of quantum gravity. With the
discovery of the Higgs boson by the ATLAS and CMS experiments [7,8], the picture would be
perfect if it were not for the fact that the quantum corrections to the Higgs potential reveal a
dramatic sensitivity to the details of the physics at very high energy, as if Newton would have
realized that the exact value of the top quark mass plays a crucial role in the motion of the Moon
around the Earth. This property goes against our intuition that physical phenomena at different
scales decouple from each other. Concretely, the one-loop corrections to My, the mass parameter
in the Higgs potential, are depicted in figure 1 and amount to

As an example, for a 10TeV cutoff, the gauge, top and Higgs contributions to the Higgs mass
square corrections are, respectively, of the order of (600 GeV)*, —(1.5TeV)* and (800 GeV)’, all
quite far from what the Higgs mass should be. The SM particles give unnaturally large corrections
