If sections of Eel-skin, treated with corrosive
sublimate, be stained with this substance, it is the goblet cells alone—and these occur
in the deep layers of the epidermis as well as near the surface—that give the charac-
teristic reddish-violet colour, the surface epidermic cells staining bright blue. I
“propose in the following pages to attempt to demonstrate that the current of rest in
the case of the Eel is more probably associated with active preparatory processes in
hg glandular elements, as Hermann originally thought to be the case for the Frog,
athan with any keratinous or mucinous demarcation surface in accordance with his later
Swriting ; ; at the same time it will be shown that both negative and positive variations
Sof the current of rest can be elicited by suitable experimental treatment of the
Bremoved skin of the Eel. Es

The Eel has been chosen for experiment principally on account of the fact that it

-* be flayed without the removal of any of the subjacent muscular tissue, but also
‘because it is easily obtained with little injury, and lives well in captivity. METHOD. Eels, caught in the River Tay without the use of a hook, were transferred as quickly

as possible to the laboratory, and kept in running water.
