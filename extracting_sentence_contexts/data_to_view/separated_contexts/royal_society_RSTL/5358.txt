we' may use theexpression 7= F?

To obtain the general form of 7 by direct calculation, from this formula would
however be found to be jimpracticable ;, the mode I adopt therefore to discover the
general expression for 7 corresponding to different values of 9, is to ascertain its
value'on the hypothesis of particular" relations existing between the roots of ;fv, and
then'from' the particular valnes of '7 thus obtained to/infer demonstrativelyits general
form, as will be seen. below.:,, The demonstration, of = is unayoidably somewhat long,
T being in fact represented by a double sum of partial symmetrical functions. Vsing the subseript indices of each function as the syzygetic equation to denote its
degree in z, we have in general

tent E=Tncisſr+=0,
where if we make

h=r=R, "hy —o=k; h,—x=k,,,

80' that

hi-h=k— hi,

Thy, hae. ho) =C(Fs, a-biag),

we have in effect found
