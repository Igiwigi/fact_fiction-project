zero pressure. In §3, we have learned that an extremely fast loading yy >1 can eliminate the
viscoelastic relaxation effects and yield an instantaneous pressure-volume change response of a
shell. Therefore, in the following we will conduct volume-controlled loading to different time
moments of interest in the holding and releasing process, and unload (or load for some cases)
at an extremely high rate to obtain the corresponding instantaneous pressure-volume change
responses, which provide information on the stability evolution of the viscoelastic shell.

We follow the same loading process up to the different time moments as in figure 5a, and
unload at a very high rate of changes in the volume yy = 10 to obtain the instantaneous pressure
AP/Eo-volume change AV/Vp relations (figure 6a-f). When the shell is unloaded at moment
2, right after the instantaneous pressure is applied (figure 5a), the instantaneous AP/E9-AV/Vo
relation (figure 62) is exactly the same as the AP/Eg-AV/Vo curve for the elastic shell with the
same geometry (the red curve in figure 3b). This agreement is due to the fact that creeping has not
yet started and thus viscoelasticity plays no role. At moment 2, the local minimum pressure of
the instantaneous AP/Eg—AV/Vo curve, APmin/Eo, is larger than zero, so the shell is monostable.
When the pressure is held until moment 3, APmin/Epo of the instantaneous AP/Ey—-AV/Vo curve
decreases to zero (figure 6b). When the pressure is held for an even longer time, for example until
moment 4, APmin/Eo of the instantaneous AP/Ey—AV/Vo curve becomes negative (figure 6c).
Accordingly, the number of the intersection points between the instantaneous AV/Vo-AV/Vo
curve and the horizontal line of AP/E 9 =0 (dashed line) changes from one (figure 6a) to two
(figure 6b), and eventually to three (figure 6c). Thus, the stability of the shell transitions from
a monostable state to bistable state due to viscoelastic creeping, with moment 3 as the critical
transition time, at which APmin/Eo = 0.

Right after the pressure is removed, the shell jumps from the configuration at moment 4 to the
