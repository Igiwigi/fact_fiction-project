I have not been able to trace directly the hydrocyanic acid which figures in this
equation, but this acid appears unmistakeably in its products of decomposition. The
brown substance which accompanies the 8ulphide of triethylphosphine and the hydrate
of tetrethylphosphonium is rich in nitrogen ; boiled for some time with hydrochloric
acid, it yields abundance of chloride of ammonium. In fact, it was on account of the
presence of ammonia among the products of the reaction, that it became necessary to pre-
cipitate the tetrethylphosphonium in the first place in the form of the gold-compound. I have likewise examined the behaviour of disulphocyanate of ethylene with triethyl-
phosphine. The reaction takes place with energy at ordinary temperatures.
