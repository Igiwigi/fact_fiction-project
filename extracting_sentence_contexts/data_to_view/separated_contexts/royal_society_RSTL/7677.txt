They show us that there is a considerable succession of sedimentary strata, pierced
by volcanic rocks which form the summits of the mountains. Fossil plants occur in all
the beds, but the siderite and limonite contain them in the greatest abundance and in
the best state of preservation. Tn fact the slabs from these beds are quite covered with
specimens, lying in every direction (7. c. p. 10). Among the leaves I found two insects, a beetle and one of the Hemiptera. These
must have been inhabitants of dry land, as well as the plants.
