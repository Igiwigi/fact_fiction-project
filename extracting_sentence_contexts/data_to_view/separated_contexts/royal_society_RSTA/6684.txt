It is clearly
impossible to derive an accurate (pressure, time) curve from these records. A full discussion of the distortion which appears when a parallel-plate unit is used with
a similar pulse is given in § 12; in the meantime, comparison of figures 22a and 226 with
figure 12 immediately brings out the fact that the slight oscillations of pressure which occur
in the rising part of figure 12 (as shown by the periodic displacements of the experimental

points about the smoothed (£, ¢) curve) are very much smaller than the corresponding oscilla-

tions in figures 22a and 226, whilst the high-frequency oscillations which follow the main

pulse in the latter figures are absent from the former. This agrees with the conclusion reached
: above, and experiments to be described later (see figure 34) do in fact show that with a
| parallel-plate condenser unit, much sharper pulses are necessary to produce measurable
amounts of high-frequency oscillations at the tail of the main pulse.

Ficure 24, Analysis of the record shown in figure 22. It is interesting to consider the periods of the oscillations in the records shown in figures
22a and 226 from the standpoint of the method of stationary phase (see subsection (6) of
this section). For this purpose, the analysis of the record of figure 224 is given in figure 23
and that of the record of figure 224 in figure 24.
