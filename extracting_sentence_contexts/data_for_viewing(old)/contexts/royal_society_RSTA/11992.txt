which (A, B, ©) is now to be varied; and this, when there is no permanent
etism, leads to the same mechanical forcive as an energy function §«(a°-+ B’+y°),

nected with the internal work of orientation of the molecules. This energy
ction is not the whole kinetic energy of the wether: that would be in the present

he space-integral of (a« + bB + cy)/8a + 4 (a? + B+ y°), of which the latter

Tt is to be remarked that the magnetic vector potential, obtained in the previous
eras the vector potential of the Amperean currents in the form

F = |(Bd/dz — Cd/dy)r~'dr,

mplies that- the orbital velocities of the electrons do not approximate very closely
0 the velocity of radiation, a condition which in reality is sutticiently satisfied :
Sf that were not so, this expression would require correction for an wthereal dis-
acement part of the molecular current.
