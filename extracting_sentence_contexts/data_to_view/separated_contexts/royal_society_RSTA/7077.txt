For lead azide, all the points for the different masses lie on the same straight line, i.e. down
to 3mg. at least, the activation energy does not depend on the bulk taken, and detonation
“builds up’ in a mass 3>mmg. With a bulk-density of 4:4, a uniform layer of initiator at the bottom of a no. 8 Briska
detonator tube has a thickness of about 10-3cm./mg. It is very unlikely that the ‘build-up’ is conditioned by any self-heating mechanism in
view of the small thickness of the layers involved, and also in view of the fact that sensitization
persists on cooling and then re-heating. Discussion

(i) The greater volume of initiator required for ‘build-up’ with mercury fulminate gives
some explanation why mercury fulminate is much less sensitive to grit than lead azide. From
the experimental conditions, the hot spots formed by rubbing grit on a hard surface are very
local.
