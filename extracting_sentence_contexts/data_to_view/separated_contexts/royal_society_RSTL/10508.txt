and each of these gives off four rudimentary tre, or intra-branchial, cartilages—small

This inferior, arrested, imtra-branchial framework is covered with a © lower velum,”
and the projection of the four pairs of rudimentary cerato-branchials makes it have a
crenate margin (Plate 1, fig. 4); it is the broad radiment of the membrane which
runs under the pharynx in the Lamprey at the entrance of the © branchial canal ;”
the copious growths of gill-tufts on each side, divided by the three clefts, lie under it,
partially covered. All these larval structures may exist in the chondrocranium before the Petromyzine
skull is modified either by outer or inner bones, and the skull of the larva explains,
and is explained by, the skull of Petromy:on and its congeners. To the Morphologist there is, here, a pause ; but, in fact, in the growth of the
Tadpole's skull, there is none ; changes begin 800n, and the work of transformation
then goes on steadily. B. b.—Perfect chondrocranium—before the formation of bony centres—in
