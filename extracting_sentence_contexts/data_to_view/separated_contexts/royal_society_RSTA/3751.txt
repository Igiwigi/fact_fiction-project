Figure 6 presents contour shades (colour) of the pre-multiplied co-spectra
magnitudes. The dark solid line, which is 4x ~ y, seems to pass roughly through the middle of
the contours. In fact, the proportionality of the length scale with wall distance is a well-known empirical
result in wall turbulence, especially in the inertial region [3,4]. More recently, and as discussed
at the outset, the analysis that starts from the mean momentum equation of the wall-bounded
turbulent flow has placed this distance-from-the-wall scaling on a more rigorous footing (e.g.
[12-15]), and most recently for the zero-pressure-gradient turbulent boundary layer as well
[18]. As described previously, a central element of the theory is the finding of a length-scale
distribution, W(y), that allows the mean momentum equation to be written in a self-similar from.
