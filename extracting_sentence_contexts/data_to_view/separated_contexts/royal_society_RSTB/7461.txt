Since the coming of the white man intercourse
between the mainland of Papua and the islands has been facilitated. Thus it is to be expected that the style and decorative motifs of the tobacco pipes
should show affinities with those of the Western Division of Papua west of the Fly and
of the Kiwaians of Mawata and Kiwai island. There can be little doubt that tobacco
pipes were exchanged occasionally, and so we may expect to find a few Torres Straits
pipes in Papua and Papuan pipes in the islands, but as a matter of fact there are but
few in either areas which can definitely be regarded as alien. I have dealt (1912, pp. 141-3, 377-83; and for decorative patterns and designs,
pp. 343-61) at such length with tobacco smoking and tobacco pipes in Torres Straits
that I need give here only a summary, which, however, includes all the matter relevant
for comparative purposes. We know that tobacco was grown and smoked in bamboo pipes in Torres Straits
a hundred years ago.
