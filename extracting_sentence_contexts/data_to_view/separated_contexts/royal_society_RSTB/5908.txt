The main evolutionary trends from this point culminate, on the one hand
in the Daphniids where the filter organ consists of an enormously developed siniobase,
and on the other, in the Anostraca where the siniobase has enlarged to its utmost and
fused with the distal endites to form a complete filter functionally the same as the

filter sete had not developed, a gap

filter of Daphnia. The ultimate filtering limb of the Branchiopoda has been termed a phyllopodium,

that is, the leaf-like leg. The conception of a leaf-like structure is something which is
flat, but the idea that the Branchiopod phyllopodium, or in fact, the Malacostracan
phyllopodium, is flat, has arisen simply because these limbs have been studied after
having been removed from the body and flattened under a coverslip. The Branchiopod
phyllopodium wherever it occurs, consists of a thickened corm from which the exites,
endopodite and endites all project backwards, and I have shown throughout this
paper that the functioning of the limb depends absolutely on this arrangement. Together
with the body wall at its base, the shape of the limb is that of a bath
