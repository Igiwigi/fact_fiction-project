These circumstances are recorded merely as simple occurrences which point to the
necessity for further experiment on this curious and important subject, and not as
results from which any very positive conclusions can be deduced. Nevertheless, I
may add, that I think I have before observed that embryos which have been the
result of feeundation with very small quantities of fluid, are usually smaller than
others which are produced from full and natural impregnation.

'The effect produced by immersion of the egg in pure fluid is as curious as the
results above mentioned obtained from minimum quantities, and at first it is less easily
to be understood. I can find no more expressive term by which to indicate it than
that of smothering, and this, perhaps, may be found to be a more literally correct ex-
pression of the fact than at first is apparent. It has already been shown that free
atration is most essential to the development of the embryo, and I believe it is equally
80, in a minor degree, to fecundation. Thus while the egg may be fecundated in a
dense fluid, composed of equal parts of seminal fluid and water, its changes usually
take place much more slowly than when the proportion of water is considerably
increased ; while if it be immersed in pure fluid, and be allowed to remain in that for
some hours, it may still be fecundated, and its changes be commenced, but these will
not proceed to the full deyelopment of the embryo. If the egg when immersed in
pure fluid be retained in a moderately low temperature, then the development of tae
embryo may go on slowly for a time, but with less rapidity than when the egg is
freely aGrated in pure water. But if, on the other hand, it be retained in seminal
fluid, at a high temperature, then it usually happens that although the respiratory
chamber be formed, as the result of fecundation, segmentation will proceed slowly, or
