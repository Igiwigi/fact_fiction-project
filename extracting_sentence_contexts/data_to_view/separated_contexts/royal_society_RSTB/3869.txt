Embryology may again be referred to in endeavouring to explain the relationship
of such a contractile system to that which exists in vertebrates. The vertebrate
heart is formed by the fusion of two longitudinal vessels, which run parallel to one
another along the ventral side of the body. These vessels reach the mid-ventral
position by the growing round of the two lateral body folds ; before this occurs they
therefore lie in a very lateral position in the embryo, in fact, in the very position in
which the two longitudinal contractile vessels lie in Hirudo. In ‘The Origin of
Vertebrates,’ W. H. GaskrLt (13) has shown that an extremely close comparison can
be drawn between these two longitudinal vessels of the vertebrate embryo and the
two longitudinal venous sinuses of Limulus. The latter function as branchial vessels
supplying the blood to the branchize for aeration.
