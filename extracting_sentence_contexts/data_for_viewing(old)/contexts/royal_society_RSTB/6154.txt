tion from the tangential walls, the directing influence of an old wall must overrule
any orienting tendency in the protoplasm. We may conclude, therefore, for the
cases studied, that in the absence of any old wall the protoplasm can lay down


170 R. D. PRESTON ON THE ORGANIZATION OF

cellulose micelles in a definite direction over a considerable period, but that when an
old wall is present the direction of the micelles in a new layer conforms more closely to that in
the old wall than to that imposed on it by the protoplasm. There seems to be no reason
why this cannot be generalized to cover the majority of vegetable tissues.

The fact that here and there we get fluctuations in the inclination on tangential
walls, corresponding to those on radial walls, indicates that the micelles in the
radial wall can influence in some way the direction in which the micelles are laid
down in the tangential walls. The number of “ coincidences” in the curves for
cedar (fig. 12) is too great to have arisen by pure chance. These fluctuations are
not due to any variation in the protoplasmic mechanism, for the new radial layer
is laid down under the influence of an old wall. An alternative explanation can be
put forward if the new wall layer is laid down as a continuous layer surrounding
each daughter protoplast. The fibrils will be more or less continuous on passing
from a radial to a tangential wall. It may be that at the point where a fibril is
turning the corner from a radial to a tangential wall, it can impose upon that part
of it which forms the tangential wall an approximation to its own direction in the
radial wall. The conception is, of course, extremely vague as all such speculations
