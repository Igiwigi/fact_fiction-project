It is therefore the true expression of the minimum limit
in the reaction delay of the organ. In this respect the observations confirm those of BERNsTEIN in the frog’s muscle as
to the delay in motorial nerve-endings, which was found to be ‘0032 second, but,
owing to the intensity and rapid development of the electrical response in an
electrical organ, the measurement can in the case of this tissue be effected with far
greater certainty than in the case of muscle. *

The second noteworthy fact is involved in that just referred to, and leads to most
important conclusions. If the stimulating current excites the organ which it
traverses, it is hypothetically possible that it may stimulate either the nerves, or the
protoplasmic structure of the plate in which the nerves end, or both the nerves and
this structure. The uncomplicated character of such a record as Plate 2, fig.
