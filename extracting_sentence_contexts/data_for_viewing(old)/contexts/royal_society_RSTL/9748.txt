tube was taken in which there were a number of small objects, 8nch as pieces of
glass. The tube being of a very high exhaust there was phosphorescence over the
ple of the interior of the tube, and all these small objects cast shadows, the pieces of
zlass also giving out phosphorescence. If the finger was brought in contact with the
ube a little on the negative side of any one of these small objects (Plate 29, fig. 24),
t was found that the molecular streams that were proceeding down the tube from the
gative terminal were 80 far turned aside by the cross currents of molecules that
ceeded from the interior surface of the tube beneath the finger that they no longer
ruck the object but passed completely over it, 80 that it gave no shadow at all.
nd the fact that the molecular streams did not reach it was not only shown by the
nce of a shadow but it was also directly demonstrated in the case of the small
s of glass by the fact that they ceased to manifest phosphorescence ; 80 that it was
blighed beyond contradiction that the molecular streams that formerly reached
em no longer did 80. :
2 On these grounds, then, we may accept the hypothesis that the virtual shadow is
e to the beating down of the streams of molecules that pass along from the negative
Pprminal, It will be remembered that they are moving at a very slight angle to the
Bdes of the tube, 80 that a very small deflection would suffice to account for this pheno-
Zenon. This last point seems to be an exsential condition for the formation of the virtual
ow, for in the case of short tubes, in which the negative terminal is a wire placed
y and projecting a considerable distance into the tube 80 that the molecular streams
d no longer proceed at a slight angle to the sides of the tube, it has been found
, to get good virtual shadows even with a fairly long positive air-spark.
