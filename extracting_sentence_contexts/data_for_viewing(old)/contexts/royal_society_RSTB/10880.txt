large-scale transmission interrupted in all three countries
the Public Health Emergency of International Concern was
lifted on 29 March 2016 [3] despite the fact that one might
expect further resurgences, for instance due to low-level
unobserved ongoing transmission or incomplete clearance
or reactivation of the virus in some survivors.

Throughout this outbreak estimates of the CFR have
varied widely, depending on the sub-population studied
and the methods employed [4-14]. Early estimates often
simply estimated CFR by using the number of deaths divided
by the number of cases reported to date [15,16]. These esti-
mates did not consider the fact that in a growing outbrea
a significant proportion of reported cases may yet die, or
the fact that the clinical outcome is only reported in a fraction
of cases, therefore under-estimating the true CFR [17,18].
While estimates of the CFR stemming from analysis of the
whole outbreak have been in line with those reported from
previous outbreaks, typically around 60-70% [11,12,19],
CER estimates from smaller studies have been more variable
and often considerably lower [4â€”10,13], owing to the fact that
the study populations were not representative of the overall
characteristics of reported cases, for instance often focusing
on hospitalized cases only.
