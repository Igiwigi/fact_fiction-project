strong and permanent, that no subsequent exposure will remove it. In studying the
drift deposits, I have found it a convenient test whereby to trace one set of flints from
the gravel of one period to that of another, when the general appearance of the two
gravels has been 80 much alike, that, but for the presence of these derived portions, it
would be difficult to separate them. Now in looking over M. BoucueR Ds PurTaes' fine
collection, you are at once struck with the fact, that the flint-implements from each
locality present a colouring in perfect accordance with the lithological character of the
bed of which they had formed part, indicating, I believe, not only a real derivation from
8uch beds, but also a s0journ therein of equal duration to that of the naturally broken
eflints occurring in or forming part of the same beds. Some of those from the sand d
Sf Menchecourt are not discoloured ; others, however, exhibit a more or less white por-
Eelanic coating. This depends probably upon the occasional presence in the sand d of
Syhite clayey and marly seams (d'). 'Those from the ochreous gravel of Moulin Quignon
re, on the contrary, stained of a bright yellow or ferruginous colour. The same varia-
Sions exist at St. Acheul; some of the flint-implements still retaining their fresh black
Surfaces, whilst others are weathered white or ochreous, according to the character of the
Sarticular seam of gravel in which they are met with, the unaltered ones being the most
Frequent, as the white gravel is in the largest proportion.
