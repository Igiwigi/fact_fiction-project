wn action being no longer balanced, causes the muscle to contract rapidly. The
Eonverse of this is seen in Plate 9, fig. 37, when the alkali is firs applied, and the
Zcid 1 to 500 canses a relaxation, and then a shortening of its own. To cause a
Somplete relaxation a higher dilution is necessary.

2 Plate 9, figs. 38 and 39, give tracings of passive shortening or lengthening with an

Fotive contraction (maximal stimulation) taken at intervals superimposed.
E Plate 10, fig. 40, «, b, c, illustrates the change of form the normal muscle curve
Amdergoes when treated with an alkali local application. The first © hump ” of the
active contraction is increased in altitude ; the s8econd © hump ” or elevation after
the notch is reduced. Owing to this reduction the curve is shortened. A. passive
8hortening of the muscle is seen at ec, and is, in point of fact, less than is usually
produced by solutions of these strengths.

The effect of lactic acid applied in the same manner is shown in the series <, b, c,
Plate 10, fig. 41. Here also the zecond portion of the curve is reduced, and the
relaxation becomes much more rapid. After 60” in lactic acid 1 to 2,500, a slight
contraction of 1:5 millim. is observable.
