Early measurements [8
of of indicated that it increased with decrease in grain size, d; plots of op versus d-05 showing .

a monotonic, but not linear, increase. This presented some difficulties when comparisons were

made with the theoretical analysis of Smith [16], which predicted no effect of grain size, per se. The dilemma was resolved by a set of experiments [13] carried out to demonstrate that, in simply-

cooled mild steels, carbide thickness increased monotonically with grain size, so that the variation

of of with ‘grain size’ was, in fact, a reflection of the variation of og with carbide thickness, 2c as
predicted by equation (5.2). Further studies on spheroidal carbide distributions showed that of

was related ina linear fashion to c~°» as predicted by equation (5.3), and that the ‘effective work of

fracture, yp’, was approximately 8-14 Jm~*. The significance of this figure in terms of mechanisms

of crack-tip separation at the atomic or ‘nano’-scale, will be discussed below, where it is argued

that ‘shuffling’ of atoms in the region of the microcrack tip is required to effect the full separation

of bonds.
