four junctions similar to those above described (see Plate 6, fig. 3). The blocks of
ebonite forming the top slab of the junctions were, however, in this case, made
nearly five inches in length; they projected as far as the lid of the tank, and

thus all contact between the leads and tank-water was prevented. The calori-
meter was hung below the steel lid by five glass tubes, thus ten air-tight junctions
of glass to metal were required, in fact, four of these junctions were, in reality,
double ones, for the lower extremities of the narrow tubes e and f (Plate 5, fig. 1)
had not only to be fixed into the lid of the calorimeter, but also joined on to the
ends of the silver tubing. In like manner, where they passed through the steel
lid, they had to join also on to glass tubes leading to two glass taps immersed in
the outer tank. There were, therefore, practically fourteen such joints. I have
previously described an alloy by which I was enabled to make these joints absolutely
air-tight.* In order to show how carefully all these joints were tested, as well as
several others in the external connections by which communication with the mereury
pumps was established, I extract the following from Paper A.:—‘‘In the spring of
this year the intra-mural space was exhausted until the reading of the McLeod gauge
connected therewith was reduced to 11, indicating a pressure of about 0°12 millim,
The apparatus was then left untouched fora month, except that the temperature was
