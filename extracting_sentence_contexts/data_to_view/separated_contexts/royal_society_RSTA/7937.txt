M, LOWRY AND H. HUDSON ON OPTICAL ROTATORY POWER.

case which has been examined hitherto, a definite divergence has been found between
the frequency deduced from observations of optical rotatory dispersion and the observed
frequency of the head of the band,* when this is accessible to direct observation. This
divergence may be due to the fact that accessible absorption bands are only observed in
unsaturated compounds, which necessarily possess also a characteristic absorption in
the Schumann region, so that some mutual influence between them may be expected ;
but in the derivatives of camphor it can be attributed to the composite character of the
absorption band, the optical activity of which is concentrated in a part of the band
nearest to the visible spectrum.t

In order to obtain further information in reference to the relation between absorption
and rotatory dispersion, experiments were undertaken some years ago with Mr. Guyn
Owen, in order to extend the measurements of rotatory dispersion into the region of
absorption, and thus to determine the form of the dispersion curve which is associated
with the Corron phenomenon. The choice of suitable compounds for this purpose is
of primary importance, since the observed rotations are often reduced to immeasurably
small values (as with nicotine) when the solution is diluted to a sufficient extent to allow
of the transmission of light in the region of maximum absorption.
