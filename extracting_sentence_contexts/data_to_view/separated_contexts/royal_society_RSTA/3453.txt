A thick piece of glass held in the hand for 30 seconds and

then placed in the dust atmosphere will have a figure deposited upon it, but the
anount of deposit will be small and the figure faint. The figures form best between

certain limits of temperature, and when there is a marked difference between the

plate and the surrounding atmosphere. They are very sensitive to change of
temperature ; in fact, to get a perfect cross or other figure, both plate and atmosphere
must each be uniformly heated. If, in addition to uniformly heating a plate, a
warmed body be placed below it and kept there during the time that the dust is
depositing, there is a considerable increase in the amount of deposit and a modification
of the figure formed ; for instance, if a copper cylinder, 12 millims. in diameter and
14 millims.
