-Zhe atmosphere. These may cause the diameter of the films to increase or contract,

Sub will affect them equally. A difference in surface tension would be indicated by a

Alifference in their magnitudes,

S The two simplest surfaces which can be formed with swch an apparatus are the

Sylinder and the sphere. The fact that if they change their shape they become

-pnduloids or nodoids has, of course, made the mathematical theory of the experiment

Se found in the fact that liquid eylinders offer such much greater facilities for

Sbtaining a completely black film than any other geometrical form, that every other

_—_— has been made to give way to this, which, for reasons to be detailed
ereafter, we conceive to be of prime importance.
