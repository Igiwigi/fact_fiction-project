It is to be noted that in these cases there is no highly specialised stomium, such as is
found in many Leptosporangiate Ferns. They appear to illustrate just such non-
specialised dehiscence as might be expected in cases where there has been a shifting
of the line of dehiscence from the median to a lateral position. Though the facts
noted do not in any way demonstrate that such a shifting has taken place along any
sequence of descent, they at least countenance the suggestion that there probably has
been a change from the median to the lateral dehiscence.

Taking now the position of the annulus as a whole, we see that it is oblique in the
Schizeeacer, Gleicheniacere, Hymenophyllacex, &c., while it is usually described as

& vertical in most of the Polypodiacese. The facts I have described above show that

“the one type graduates by almost imperceptible steps into the other, while even

Sin those which are described as having a vertical annulus, details may often be traced

2 which compare with those where it is oblique ; we shall not, therefore, look upon the

“A two types as essentially distinct.

S If the development be compared, it will be seen that the annulus is not specially

Slocalised in any one of those segments which appear with such constancy in the early
