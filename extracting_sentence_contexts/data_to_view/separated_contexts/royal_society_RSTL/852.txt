estimation, that from four to five pounds of common oak bark
are required to produce one pound of Jeather, it appears, from
the various synthetical experiments, that about half a pound of
catechu would answer the same purpose. *

Also, allowing for the difference in the composition of the
different kinds of leather, it appears, from the. general detail of
facts, that one pound of catechu, for the common uses of the
tanner, would be nearly equal in value to 24 pounds of galls,
to 7+ pounds of the bark of the Leicester willow, to 11 pounds
of the bark of the Spanish chesnut, to 18 pounds of the bark of
the elm, to 21 pounds of the bark of the common willow, and
to 3 pounds of sumach. Various menstruums have been proposed for the purpose of
expediting and improving the process of tanning, and, amongst
them, lime-water and the solutions of pearl-ash : but, as these
two substances form compounds with tannin which are not de-
composable by gelatine, it follows that their effects must be
highly pernicious ; and there is very little reason to suppose, that
any bodies will be found which, at the same time that they
increase the solubility of tannin in water, will not likewise di-
minish its attraction for skin,

* This estimation agrees very well with the experiments lately made by Mr, Pur x1s,
upon the tanning powers of Bombay catechu in the processes of manufacture, and which
he has permitted me to mention, Mr. Purx1s found, by the results of different

accurate experiments, that one pound of catechu was equiyalent to seven or eight of
oak bark.
