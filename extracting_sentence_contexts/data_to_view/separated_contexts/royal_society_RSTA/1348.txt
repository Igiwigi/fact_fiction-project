We assume that the capsid
is an axisymmetric domain and neglect its polyhedral structure. Although some viruses present a
chiral arrangement, this analysis focuses on standard spooling configurations around the capsid
axis. In fact, it is found that among the set of admissible configurations, the planar, azimuthal,
spool-like configuration is the unique minimizer. The shape of the core depends on the physical
parameters of the model, and in particular, the bending rigidity of the DNA. Determining the appropriate parameter ranges of the effective coefficients of the model
involves three types of data.
