The torpedo and the gymnotus give discharges
deereasing in strength in proportion to the number given, and they reacquire their
faculty of giving more powerful shocks after an interval of repose. The torpedo, over-
excited by nux yomica, gives shocks more powerful than usual. This Jast and the
preceding facts establish the connection between the intensity of the neryous force
and that of the electric discharge of fishes,

I trust that I have demonstrated in this memoir, which contains the summary of
my numerous researches upon the phenomena of electric fishes, that there exists in
the electric organs of these fish a very simple case of relation between neryous force
and electricity, established by well-determined laws. Pisa, January 1847. MDCCCXLVII.
