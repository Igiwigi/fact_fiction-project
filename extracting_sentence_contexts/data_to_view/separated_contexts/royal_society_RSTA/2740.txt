Systems can be validated for correspondence to key goals
and requirements. In safety-critical applications, software systems are presented together with
assurance cases, documents that are meant to convince a sceptical expert that the system operates
as intended, and which detail the steps taken to assure fidelity of the system to its stated
goals [28,29]. Further, this analysis holds the focus of review away from the logic of processing
itself and maintains attention on the important question of why the logic in use is the best
solution to the problem at hand (further, it opens to review the question of whether the problem
being attacked is in fact the problem that should have been considered or whether the measures
of success employed to refine requirements caused a focus on the wrong questions) [14]. We
refer to this as a kind of intensional understanding, borrowing a term from formal logic where
an intensional definition of a collection is a rule for inclusion in or exclusion from the collection. SThis is in contrast to extensional definitions of a collection, which simply list all elements of the collection.
