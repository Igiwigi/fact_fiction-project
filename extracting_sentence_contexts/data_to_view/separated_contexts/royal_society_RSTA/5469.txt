While previous literature
includes simulations of composites comprising ionomers with random nanocarbon inserts [19],
no model examined sandwich-like composite structures such as IPMCs. Moreover, due to the
extensive use of ionomers as proton-exchange membranes in hydrogen fuel cells, most of the
literature has focused on protons, that is, hydronium counterions [14,17], rather than metal
ions [20-22] which are of greater interest for IPMCs. In fact, protons produce much smaller forces
in IPMC actuators than metal ions or small organic molecules [7]. Further, the effect of an external electric field has received limited attention [23-30]. These
efforts mostly considered the effect of an external electric field on the ionomer structure
and properties, under the premise of fully periodic ionomer membranes.
