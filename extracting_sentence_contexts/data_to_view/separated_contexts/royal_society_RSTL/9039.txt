Concerning this difficulty, however, I may observe that
we seem to have in it one of those cases in which it would be very unsafe to argue with
any confidence from the highly integrated nervous systems with which we are best
acquainted to the primitive nervous systems with which we are now concerned. And
although it would occupy too much space to enter into a discussion of this subject, I
may further observe that I think it is not at all improbable that the polypite of Tia-
ropsis indicans 8hould, in the absence of more definite information, refer a distant seat
of injury to that tract of collected afferent elements through which it actually receives
the strongest stimulation. The first of these two snppositions (viz. #) will be found to derive some little snpport
when we come to consider a curious class of facts to be dealt with in the next section. The second of these suppositions (viz. b) is supported by the histological researches of
Professor HLAECKEL on Geryonia, a genus which closely resembles Tiaropsis indicans in
form. This obseryer describes nerve-filaments following everywhere the course of the
radial tubes, and receiving a number of minute filaments from either side.
