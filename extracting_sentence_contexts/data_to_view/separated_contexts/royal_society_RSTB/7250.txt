The hypothesis is unable to offer any explanation of this fact. In several other ways this hypothesis fails to account for observed facts, and must there-
fore be abandoned.

(78) The rod vision hypothesis

It is well known that rod vision replaces cone vision at low intensities of illumination;
according to this hypothesis this replacement is responsible for the losses of colour which
are observed with reduction of visual angle. Four facts are at variance with this view:

(1) The fovea, which was exclusively used in these experiments, is usually accepted to
be devoid of rods. (2) Except for the experiments performed at low intensities of illumination, the observerâ€™s
eye was fully light-adapted, which would automatically exclude the use of rod vision. (3) This hypothesis offers no explanation of the changes of colour that are observed in
the following cases: yellow-green to pale blue-green; green to blue-green; purple to brown;
mauve to red-brown; crimson to orange.
