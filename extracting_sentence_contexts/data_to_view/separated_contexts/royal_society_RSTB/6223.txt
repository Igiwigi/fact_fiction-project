In both maxillae the fourth tooth is
plainly just eruptingâ€”only the centre cusp being visible, fig. 6. Additional points
are the fact that while the first three teeth are very similar to those of specimen F
the six tooth is very much larger than in any of the smaller specimens. There is no
evidence for a seventh tooth having been present. An important point in the dentition
of this specimen is that the second incisor of the left premaxilla is smaller than that
of the right, and may be erupting.
