Some of the above, and other, writers reached conclusions adverse to the SrEwART-
Scuuster theory, partly owing to the fact that the results of their analyses of
the observational data differed from Scuusrer’s. The present paper embodies an
attempt to resolve the points in dispute, and to remove other obscurities in the
theory. New analyses are made both of the solar and lunar diurnal magnetic
variations, so that the chief facts relating to each may be discussed together. It is
taken as axiomatic, in view of the general resemblance between the two phenomena,
that in the main the same theory and similar mechanisms must apply to each. Various modifications of ScuustTER’s hypotheses and results are found to be necessary,
but the essential points of the theory are confirmed by this investigation.
