We have now proved that of the twenty-seven lines on the cubic surface, each
cuts ten of the others; furthermore we have shown which line cuts which others. Now we might represent all the twenty-seven lines by their projections on a plane,
where we should have to distinguish between the projection of the actual intersection
of a pair of lines and the apparent intersection of the projections of two non-inter-
secting lines. We might from such a figure deduce many of the relations which exist
between the lines ; but the figure would be complicated, and the deductions would be
attended with some difficulty.
