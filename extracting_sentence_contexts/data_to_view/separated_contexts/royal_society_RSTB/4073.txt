But one might reasonably expect that the oxidation would gradually
diminish in degree in proportion as the concentration of acid to be oxidised became
reduced. How, then, is the secondary summit to be accounted for? The suggestion
which we put forward tentatively is based on the known fact that some oxidising
ferments (e.g. tyrosinase) are themselves very sensitive to changes in hydrogen ion
