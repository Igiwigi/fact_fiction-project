The areas (Â¢.7.) in question appear as the result of a change in the substance
occupying these alveoli, and the clear region about them is misleading, since it
suggests either that they lie in a fluid medium which has been dissolved, or that they
were originally in contact, but have undergone shrinkage, and drawn apart from one
another, to again swell a little farther within the forming enamel. Actually this clear area is a definite structure, hyaline in nature, and its invisibility
is due to that fact that it does not stain readily, or rather destains very easily. This
may be demonstrated by using iron heematoxylin as a stain, when the whole area of
devoloping enamel stains very deeply, but in differentiation the matrix destains very
rapidly and completely, causing the areas (fig. 27, e.7.) to appear as though spaces
existed between them.
