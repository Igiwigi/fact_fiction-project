Ravakrs as an embryologist, and the fact
of his having deduced his views of the mixed nature of the thoracic-abdominal part
of the skeleton of the Chelonian Reptiles from obseryation of its development, equally
demand that his conclusions should not be abandoned without special grounds being
assigned, RaTakE concludes, as has been before stated, that the carapace belongs to
the endo-skeleton exclusively-f, and the plastron as exclusively to the exo-skeleton$. With regard to the carapace, he says, © The spinous processes are already deve-
loped from the second to the eighth dorsal vertebra before the exclnsion of the em-
DIFOs cioicats they remain pretty short, but contrary to the general laws of development
of the vertebrate animals, they grow 80 much in breadth, that they form, after their
ossification, a series of horizontal plates of moderate size\,” He also takes occasion
to confute the assertions of Carus, WaGngk and PeTERs, that these plates are first
developed independently in the derm and afterwards coalesce with the spines of the
subjacent yertebrze. My observations concur with those of RaTaxe in regard to the
fact that the neural plates, answering to the eight vertebra of the carapace, are not
developed independently of the neural spines, but are connate with, or ossified con-
tinuously from them ||. Nevertheless the position of the pre-existing fibro-cartilaginous
matrix, and the distinctive character of the resulting ossification, appear to me to be
stronger grounds for determining their dermal homology, than the mere fact of their
connation in opposition to that view. The radius and ulna of the Frog are not only -
confluent but connate; 4. e. they are progressively or continnously ossified from a
