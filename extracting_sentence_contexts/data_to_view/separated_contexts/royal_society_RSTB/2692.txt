MR. H. H. DALE ON THE .“ISLETS OF LANGERHANS” IN THE PANCREAS.

have a shape strikingly similar to that of the secretory alveoli. In such, an outer
layer of larger cells can be distinguished from an inner layer of smaller cells, exactly
like centro-acinary cells. The appearance, in fact, is exactly that of a group of
alveoli in which the secreting cells have lost their characteristic basal basophil
staining and zymogen granules, their nuclei having become more centrally placed,
and assimilated to those of the centro-acinary cells, and in which the lumen has
become obliterated by a falling together of the cells. In most of such islets it can
also be seen that the sharp circumscription is only apparent, and is not due to a
capsule, as described by KtéHne and Lua. The divisions of the islet, of suggestive
alveolar shape as described above, can often be found actually continuous, beyond the
islet margin, with undoubted normal secreting alveoli, containing zymogen granules,
and staining characteristically both in cell-substance and nucleus.
