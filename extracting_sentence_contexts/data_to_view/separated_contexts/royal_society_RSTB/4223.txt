It should be noticed that the decrease in the resistances of the eggs produced by
sodium citrate and by hypertonic solutions are not altogether identical phenomena. In the presence of sodium citrate the resistance of the eggs attains a definite
equilibrium, which is completely reversible in certain cases. The decrease in the
resistance of eggs which is due to treatment with hypertonic solutions is not
reversible, and there is no evidence of any equilibrium being attainedâ€”in fact, the
injurious effect on the eggs of prolonged treatment with such solutions suggests that
no equilibrium is attained until the cells are dead. AnTAGONIsTIC Errects or Positive AND NeGative TRIVALENT Ions. If the action of the trivalent positive ions is produced owing to the production of a
positive charge on some constituent of the egg, then the effect of these ions should
be removed by exposing these eggs to a solution containing free hydroxyl ions.
