]. Introduction

Muon imaging techniques are very unique because they can be used to image objects of a very
large scale where other techniques often fail. This unique capability of muon imaging is based
on the high penetrating power of high-energy muons. Muons are elementary particles, which
are similar to electrons but about 207 times heavier. Owing to the heavy mass of muons and the

fact that muons do not take part in the strong interaction, muons lose much less energy than :2
almost all of the other particles when passing through matter. Therefore, they can penetrate much DS
deeper. There are two types of muon imaging techniques. The first is muon absorption imaging, : =
and the second is muon multiple scattering imaging. These two techniques are based on the two : =
muon interactions with matter, ie. energy loss and multiple scattering, respectively. The muon 8
absorption imaging technique can be used to image very large objects such as volcanoes [1], but it [3
can also be used to image relatively smaller objects such as nuclear spent fuel casks [2]. The muon iS
multiple scattering imaging technique can only be used to image relatively small objects, such as :8
shipping containers [3] and nuclear waste containers [4], due to the fact that both the incoming : s
and outgoing muon tracks need to be measured. 8

Muon imaging requires solving an inverse problem [5]. This is because the characteristic
properties of the imaging object cannot be measured directly using the muon imaging system.
