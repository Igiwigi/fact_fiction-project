city during the summer; but I have since been informed by a letter from my
Mr. Hamiron of Santa Cruz, that when the autumn set in there below in November,
as it had done above in September, it brought S.W. wind, rain, and snow with it, and
80 much electricity, that a house in Orotava was destroyed by lightning.

(9.) Alta Vista Storm of September 14th.

From August 30th a decided change from the long-continued routine of the summer

three days; and though the weather settled again, we could not but be struck with the
change that had occurred in the N.K. cloud. Still it formed its usual stratum at about
4000 to 5000 feet high, but its long rolls of cumuloni were broken up into separate and
distinct cumuli ; and on the south side of both Teneriffe and Grand Canary we could see
sImilar bodies of clouds advancing from the S.W., climbing the steep sides of the island,
and contesting the possession of the ridges day after day with the N.E. clouds. This
remarkable atrial combat, was carried on under our eyes with various success until Sep»

The next day the S.W. cloud was decidedly the victor, while the N.E. cloud, simply to
describe the actual facts, was retiring before it in broken and disorganized masses. The
