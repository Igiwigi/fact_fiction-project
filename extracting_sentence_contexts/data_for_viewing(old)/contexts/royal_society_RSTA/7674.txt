appropriate to the instantaneous shock (cf. the discussion of the diffraction effects when
h, = zand z—-0, p. 245). So long as the duration of the initial pulse is small compared with
the ‘p’ ofa resulting diffraction pulse then we may neglect the spread of any minimum-time
path pulse compared with that of the diffraction pulse.

It seems reasonable then to suppose that at least some explanation of the S-anomaly is
to be found in the arrival of exactly seven diffraction pulses before the true S-wave. If, as
we suppose, the tail of the P’, -pulses is blurred and insignificant at time ¢ = x/f,, then the
arrival of the first diffraction pulse might well be interpreted as the arrival of §. That there
is no concentration of frequency of the residuals might simply be due to the ‘personal
fancy’ of the individual observer; not convinced by the record of the first diffraction pulse
he might interpret the second, third, ... (or the true S) as the onset. In support of this is
the fact that, if 4 is just a fraction of H, the fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh pulses should
certainly be sharper than the first to third, and the true S sharper than any. We have not
needed to give any very exact estimate of when a diffraction pulse makes itself felt, i.e. what
fraction of the maximum U, W must be attained before it may be said to have ‘arrived’.
It is sufficient here to specify the arrival time by 7 = 0, for we are obviously dealing with
a quite considerable time difference between the first pulse and the true S. That interval
is of the order of

(2H —h)/f.B sec.
