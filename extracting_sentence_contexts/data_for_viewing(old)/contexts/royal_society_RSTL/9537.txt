each of these contains the same irrational part av XY, and the difference 1s

therefore rational ; and it is moreover integral, for we have

where each factor divides by 0, and consequently the product by & ; the value is in

a linear function of 1, &+y, xy ; and this is the case as regards the difference of any
two of the 8quares (/ab)?, (/ac)?, &c. ; hence electing any one of these squares for

instance (4/de)?, any other of the squares is of the form
Mbp(rty)+rey+p(vde}*; (p=1)

and obviously, the other squares (x/@)?, &c., are of the like form, the last coefficient p
