at present, whatever we may do hereafter, make the electricity employed in effecting
this combination evident to any of our tests ; but I consider its presence as a necessary
inference, because I have adduced facts which prove, either that electricity is the
agent in such combinations, or that nature here deviates from the simplicity observed
in all her other works. Either electricity is the agent in the combination in question,
or there are two kinds of chemical affinity.

Under such circumstances can any other reply avail except either disproving the
facts or pointing out the fallacy of the inference ?

What I have done is strikingly illustrated by the late investigations of Dr. Farapay.
It is more than twenty years since I found that voltaic electricity is capable of all the
functions of the nervous influence; it now appears from the facts, on which he has
founded his doctrine of electro-chemical equivalents, that electricity is the agent in all
chemical processes*. According to the inferences of Dr. Faravar therefore, the ex-
periments, which prove that the nervous influence is the agent in the functions we
have been considering, all of which we have seen are chemical processes, are sufficient
to prove its electric nature; and we are now also, on the other hand, furnished with
direct proof that the brain is capable of collecting and applying, even according to
the dictates of the will, the electric power.

Dr. Davy in his last paper on the torpedo-f observes that, Â© when the brain has been
