In the method there employed, the condition that the
point P $hould be sextactic, involved the azimuth of the plane of section measured
Zabout an axis passing through P; and consequently, regarded as an equation in the
Sazimuth, it <howed that the point would be sextactic for certain definite sections. It
Sdoes not, however, follow, if conics having six-pointic contact with the surface U be
>frawn in the planes 80 determined, that a single quadric surface can be made to pass
Sthrough them all. In fact it will be shown in the sequel that when this is possible, the
-Squadric in general degenerates into a pair of planes. The investigation therefore of the
-Zmemoir above quoted was yot directly concerned with the contact of surfaces, although
Sit may be regarded as dealing with a problem intermediate to the contact of plane
urves and that of surfaces. '>
