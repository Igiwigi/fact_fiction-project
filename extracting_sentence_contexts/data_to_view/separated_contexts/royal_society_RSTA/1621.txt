Turning now to the positive evidence in favour of a hydrocarbon origin for the Swan
bands, we have the experimental observation recorded in Section II. Only Pure
Hydrogen can be admitted by heating the Palladium regulator of such a tube. The fact
that the tubes used were furnished with side bulbs containing caustic potash and phos-
phorus pentoxide, respectively, and in some cases had been run for hundreds of hours,
eliminates any doubt as to their complete freedom from Oxygen. ‘The Swan bands were
therefore produced with intense brilliance in the presence of high pressure Argon, with
only Carbon and Hydrogen present, and the admission of Hydrogen was necessary,
otherwise the tube ‘cleaned up,’ leaving only the continuous and a little of the red
spectrum of Argon. Warts (34) describes a number of experiments in which the possibility of Oxygen
contamination was probably eliminated.
