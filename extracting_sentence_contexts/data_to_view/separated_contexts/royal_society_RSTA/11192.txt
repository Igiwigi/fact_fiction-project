The largest wires used in establishing the above formule were 14 millims. It is

diameter, the calculated and experimental values differ considerably. This diver-
gence is also in some degree accounted for by the fact that the enclosures used
in the two cases were of an entirely different shape and size. In a paper recently published, Mr. C.
