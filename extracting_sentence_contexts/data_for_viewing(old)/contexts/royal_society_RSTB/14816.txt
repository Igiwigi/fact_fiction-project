evolves under directional selection (shaded region) gradually converging to the singular strategy z*. Once the population expresses z*, stabilizing selection
(h(z*) < 0) maintains the population monomorphic for z*. Simulations are shown for the biological scenario given in electronic supplementary material, appendix
A.1 (parameters used: v = 0.0005, 4 = 0.8, f = 2, B; = 2, B, = —2, B; = 0, and with mutations occurring with probability 0.01 in offspring and whose effects on
the trait have mean 0 and standard deviation 0.02). Each grey dot is the trait expressed by an individual (we randomly sampled 25 individuals every 1000 gen-
erations), thick black line is the population average, and thin black line is the convergence stable and uninvadable strategy z*. (6) Evolution under disruptive
selection and the emergence of polymorphism (same model as in (a) with B, = 1.35, By = 0.5 and B; = 1). The population first converges to z* under directional
selection (shaded region) and then becomes dimorphic owing to disruptive selection. (Online version in colour.)
