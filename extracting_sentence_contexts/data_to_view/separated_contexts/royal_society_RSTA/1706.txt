Nevertheless, it was shown in [15] that the Stokes operator, suitably defined,
generates a bounded analytic semigroup on L3°(R',). It is thus not surprising that the Stokes
operator defined on layers @ of the form 2 =R"-! x (0,1) generates also an analytic semigroup
on Co,¢(2) and ub (Q) for n=2. However, it is a very remarkable fact that the corresponding
results for n > 3 are false, see §3a and [16] for details. This means that the solution of the Stokes
equation in these cases is not governed by an analytic semigroup, implying again that a good
understanding of those domains 2 CR" for which the Stokes equation is well-posed now in
L1(Q) or L9(Q), respectively, is missing. Abe & Giga [17] were able to prove via a contradiction argument that the Stokes operator,
suitably defined, generates an analytic semigroup To on Co,¢(@) and L3°(2) for a large class of
domains.
