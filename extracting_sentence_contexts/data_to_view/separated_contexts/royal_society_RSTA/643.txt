This must in general be the case, if quantum or wave mechanics is
interpreted as a rational generalization of classical physics [mechanics], which take into
account the finiteness of the quantum of action [Planck’s constant, h]. The probabilities
occurring in the new laws have then to be considered to be primary, which means not
deducible from deterministic [causal] laws. As an example of these primary probabilities
I mention here the fact that the time at which an individual atom will undergo a certain
reaction stays undetermined even under conditions where the rate of occurrence of this
reaction for a large collection of atoms is practically certain. [46, p. 32]

Pauli speaks of determinism rather than causality, but this does not affect my argument because,
as explained earlier, in the case of classical mechanics both notions coincide. Most important is


Pauli’s main claim: ‘The theory predicts only the statistics of the results of an experiment, when
it is repeated under a give condition. Like the ultimate fact without any cause, the individual
outcome of a measurement is, however, in general not comprehended by laws’.
