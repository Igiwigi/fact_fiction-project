Buxsen+F exploded together carbonic oxide, hydrogen or cyanogen with oxygen,
and, after varying his experiments greatly, deduced the following conclusions :—
1. When two or more bodies B, B', .... are presented in excess to the body A, under the
circumstances most favourable to their union, the body A takes from each of them
B, B',.... quantities which always stand to one another in a simple relation ; s0 that for
1,2,3,4.... atoms of the one compound, there are formed 1,2, 3,4....atoms of the

* BexGMAN even had some perception of the influence of quantity, as when he says,—* Jam ulterius restat
explorandum, num omne d sufficiente c possit unione pristina extrudi. Probe hoc in genere notetur oportet,
decomponentis c duplo, triplo, immo interdum sextuplo majore opus esse quantitate, quam que 7g A libero

other. 2. If in this manner there is formed one atom of the compound A+B, and one
atom of the compound A+B', the mass of the body B may be increased in the presence
of that of B' up to a certain point, without any change in that atomic proportion : but
if a certain limit be passed, the relation of the atoms, which was that of 1 : 1, changes
suddenly and becomes 1:2, 1:3, 2:3, and 80 on. 3.
