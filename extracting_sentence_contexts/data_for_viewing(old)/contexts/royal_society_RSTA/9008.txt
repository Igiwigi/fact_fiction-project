Without dealing with the whole of the material at disposal we will illustrate its
application by considering in more detail the portion of the spectrum given on p. 382
in which the majority of the lines undoubtedly belong to D (1) systems. It is to be
noticed that the effectiveness of the method in the present case depends on the facts,
(1) that the observation errors do not exceed dA = ‘05, and (2) that with m = 1 it is
consequently possible to determine the values of the mantisse to within 6 units in
the sixth significant figures, whilst a displacement of one oun in the sequent produces
a change in of the order 1°2, or twenty-four times the maximum observation error.
The limit 51025 being supposed displaced by yd, becomes 51025'29—10°62y+é The
mantissee of the sequences are then. calculated with this limit, and expressed in terms
of A,, 5,,2 and p where A, = 10998°2+a, and —p is the ratio of the observation error
to the maximum (dA = ‘05). The series more fully discussed above is definitely taken
as depending on the limit y= 0. In other words the mantissa of 19989 is exactly 80A,
which condition requires, writing q for its p,

3°2+30°29¢—6q + 80a = 0,
