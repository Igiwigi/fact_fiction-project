8ynchronows, when the afferent disturbance reaches the ganglion the amplitude of the ganglionic vibrations
would be somewhat increased, Hence the stimulation, which was proviously being continuously supplied by
the ganglionic vibrations, and which before being augmented by the arrival of the afferent vibrations was
50mewhat less than minimal, wonld now become minimal or 80mewhat more than minimal. And, conversely,
the facts of inhibition are explained by this theory of ganglionie action as due to an interference of vibrations
tho rates of which are not synchronous,

Medusz, the slightest want of ganglionic coordination exhibited by any of the specimens.
Moreover, that the ganglionic coordination is in this case wonderfully far adyanced, is
proved by the fact of members of this genus being able to steer themselyes while
following a light, as described in my last paper *.

In the discophorous species of naked-eyed Medusz, however, perfectly coordinated
action is by no means of such inyariable occurrence as it is in Sersia ; for although in
perfectly healthy and vigorous specimens systole and diastole occur at the same instant
over the whole nectocalyx, this harmoniously acting mechanism is very liable to be
thrown out of gear; 80 that when the animals are suffering in the least degree from
any injurious conditions—often too slight and obscure to admit of discernment—the *
swimming movements are n0 longer synchronous oyer the whole nectocalyx ; but now
one part is in systole while another part is in diastole, and now several parts may be in
diastole while other parts are in systole. And, as in these animals very slight causes
scem $ufficient thus to impair the ganglionic coordination, it generally happens that in
