ture to form its anastomoses with the subspinal vein without occasioning two oppo-
sing currents in the same vessel, and this diversion of the current may perhaps be
effected through the interposition of the two imperfect chambers of the heart in the
last abdominal segment.

Recapitulation and Conclusion.

Although I propose to continue these investigations of the anatomy and develop-
ment, of the nervous and circulatory systems in the other classes of Articulata, it may
be well briefly to recapitulate the principal statements contained in this paper.

1. First, in regard to the neryous system, which has already s0 deeply engaged the
attention of physiologists, certain facts appear, nevertheless, to have been overlooked
or imperfectly examined. The double neryous cord is composed in all the Articulata
of a superior and inferior series of longitudinal fibres, superimposed one on the other,

as I formerly had the honour of stating to the Royal Society. Both these series
may be traced along the whole cord upwards to the cerebral ganglia, and hence may
fairly be inferred to minister to volition and sensation, either separately, or, as there
Seems reason to believe, conjointly, throngh a mutual, partial interchange of fibres ;
although it appears almost impossible to demonstrate, with certainty, by any experi-
ment on these structures, the precise individual function of either series. The infe-
