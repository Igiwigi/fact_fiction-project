This result does not, however, negative the possibility that some of the reaction
may take the form of spin. If part of the reaction fails to reach the rigid structure of
the iron in time to be measured in 6, this may be due to a break, more or less complete,
in some of the paths along which momentum might otherwise pass immediately to the
iron from the rotating electrons when their orbits are turned. Such a break may be
pictured as a place where slipping occurs in the mechanism which constitutes the
momentum path, and slipping has in fact been suggested* (though without much
conviction) as one among other possible causes of the low value of the Ratio. *O. W. Ricnarpsoy. Solvay Congress, 1921.
