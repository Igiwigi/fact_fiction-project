The effect of this current of air is remarkable, as the time of luminosity of the air column
was found in subsequent experiments to be less than 10~° second, and the actual
displacement of the air during that time must have been quite inappreciable. The most
probable explanation is that the spark passes through those portions of the air which
have been made conducting by preliminary invisible discharges. The air put into
the sensitive state by these first partial discharges has time to move over a sensible
distance before the main spark passes.

It is remarkable how the metallic vapours in this photograph seem to be drawn
into the glass tube.

Fig. 17, Plate 9.—Photograph of a succession of sparks taken with a small jar and
large induction coil. This photograph illustrates the fact that, in the ordinary
arrangement adopted to produce metallic spectra, the air discharge is predominant,
while the metallic cloud is chiefly confined to the neighbourhood of the electrodes.

5. Measurement of Molecular Velocities.

We may now pass to the description of the results obtained when the spectrum of
a single spark is taken on a moving film. A preliminary trial with various metallic
electrodes had shown us that the sharpest results were obtained with zinc, and we
chose, therefore, that metal for investigation under various conditions. Fig. 18
(Plate 10) gives the spectrum as we obtained it on the stationary film. The lines
of zine which appear on it are*:—
