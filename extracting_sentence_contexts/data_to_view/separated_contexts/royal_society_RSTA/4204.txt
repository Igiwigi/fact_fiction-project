This is why the
outcomes of quantum experiments will in general be different. This situation could, however, be =
interpreted on either frequentist or Bayesian lines, even if one adopts a non-realist view [18]. :

This summary sidesteps some of the deeper aspects of probability, but it suffices for my :
purposes.â€™ I would like to add that probability introduces an element of order into situations nee)
defined by the role of randomness in them, and enables us to handle such situations better. :
Probability or statistics is, thus, about the interplay of randomness and order. This fact takes a]
on a unique significance in quantum physics because of the presence of statistically ordered DNS
correlations (not found in classical physics) between certain data, such as those of the experiments area
of the EPR type. One of the greatest mysteries, if not the greatest mystery, of quantum physics :&
is that, under certain, but not all, circumstances, random individual events conspire to form .
statistically correlated and thus statistically ordered multiplicities. These correlations are correctly
predicted by QM.
