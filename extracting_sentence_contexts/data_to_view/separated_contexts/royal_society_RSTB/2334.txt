Phot. 14 is from the first section at the proximal end;
phot. 15 represents the sixth from the proximal end, and shows the typical structure
where the width of the seed is at its maximum, Phot. 16 is the seventh, and is from
the distal extremity, being the last which shows the seed-cavity. The determination
of the proximal and distal ends follows at once from the comparison with Wr1p’s cone
(phot. 11), from which it is evident, as indeed must necessarily be the case, that the
“seed” is narrowest at its proximal, and broadest at its distal extremity. The most striking fact which comes out from the study of this series is the great
radial length of the micropyle, which, from its appearing in practically all the sections,
is shown to be a long narrow crevice, extending throughout the whole length of the
seed from one end to the other. It is thus very different from the more or less tubular
micropyle of the seeds of Phanerogams. Winiramson, who had not the opportunity
of examining a complete series of sections, was unaware of this fact, which appreciably
weakens the resemblance to a true seed, for it is only when cut tangentially, at right
angles to the micropylar crevice, that the characteristic seed-like appearance is
presented.
