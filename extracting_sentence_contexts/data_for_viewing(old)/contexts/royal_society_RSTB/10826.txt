domly—as long as M > O(log P)! [53]. This means that for
sufficiently large P, the minimally required M is proportional
to log(P). Distances are approximately preserved when randomly
weighted averages are taken (equivalent to projections onto
randomly oriented axes) or dimensions are selected at random.
Importantly, the number M> O(log P) of random samples
required is independent of the dimensionality N of the original

rapidly along the cortex (features 4—6), but will approximately preserve
selectivities that vary slowly along the cortex (features 1-3).

retinotopic maps in early visual cortical areas. The fact that the
model defines not only a computational process, but also the
spatial arrangement of the computational units, enables us to pre-
dict how the model's internal representations would be reflected in
locally averaging fMRI voxels.

A voxel sampling a little patch of V1 will average signals from
neurons with very similar spatial receptive fields and selectivities
for different orientations. We therefore expect that orientation-
specific signals will be attenuated in the voxel patterns, whereas
information about the overall spatial distribution of contrast
across the image will be better preserved (figures 2 and 3). It is unli-
kely that a voxel samples all orientations (and similarly the entire
