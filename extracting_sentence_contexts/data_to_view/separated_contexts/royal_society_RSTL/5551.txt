The lower side margins consist
of a plain membrane, in which angular cells gradually become visible: round the central
protuberances these cells become elongated, but on the surface of the protuberance
regain their first $hape. A dotted membrane is also evident here. I have not succeeded in either obtaining ephippial eggs from isolated specimens, or in
clearly proving that these eggs require impregnation, and the facts bearing on this $ub-
Ject may be summed up as follows. In the first place, the common eggs of D. Schafferi,

which T have in this paper called © agamic,” certainly do not require to be fertilized in
the ordinary manner; and as these two sorts of eggs only, 7. e. the agamic and the ephip-
pial, are produced when the males are tolerably numerous, and may often be observed in
coitu, it follows either that impregnation is necessary for the ephippial eggs, or, which in
the present state of our knowledge seems less probable, that one or both sorts of eggs
may be impregnated, but that neither of them require to be 80. Whenever ephippia were produced, as a general rule, I could also find males; and at
the time when there were most ephippia, the males were most numerous; but once when
there were a good many ephippia, I could, after careful search, find only one male ; and
though I continued every morning for several days to look for males, T could not find
another specimen, although at the same time ephippia were being developed.
