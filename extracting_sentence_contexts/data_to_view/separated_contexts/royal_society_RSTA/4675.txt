In addition, we need to ensure that the thickness of the
coating is small, so that the resultant flat reflector (with coating) has a low profile, which was our
principal motivation of the flat reflector project to begin with. To the best of our knowledge, a
systematic procedure for designing such thin coatings has not yet been developed. In fact, such
surfaces that are also known as reflectarrays, are almost always designed to match only the phase
of the reflected field, rather than to control the amplitude distribution of this field in its aperture. Incidentally, reflectarrays are inherently narrowband in comparison to the parabolic reflector, at
least when they are fabricated by using metasurfaces, as they almost always are. We now show that this problem of designing a surface with specific reflection characteristics
can also be cast in terms of the scattering matrix formulation.
