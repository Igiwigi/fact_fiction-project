General discussion

From the infant perspective, individual mealtime scenes are
highly cluttered with many different objects in view. However,
across the scenes in the corpus, there is a small set of objects that
are repeatedly present. This statistical fact about the distri-
bution of visual objects suggests that not all the objects in the
clutter are equal contenders as referents for heard words. By
the Pervasiveness Hypothesis, the prevalence of a few object
categories biases the candidate referents that are tracked and
linked to heard words, a proposal that is supported by the
observed correspondence between the set of highly frequent
visual objects and normatively first-learned object names. These findings provide new insights about how truly novice
learners may break into object name learning.
