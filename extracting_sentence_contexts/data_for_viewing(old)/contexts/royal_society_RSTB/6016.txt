North China indicates that at this time a way towards the South may have been open to
Sinanthropus, though curiously enough a generally effective faunal barrier seems to
have existed then, just as now, between the Yangtze and Hoangho basins.

Judging from the animal and plant remains, the climate was milder in Choukoutien
times than now, the persistence of a red staining of the loams (probably not wholly
to be accounted for by a re-washing of earlier sediments) points to the prevalence of
conditions at present characterizing somewhat lower latitudes (Back, 1931, b).

(8) Cultural environment.—In a very broad sense the Choukoutien culture may be
defined as an industry of old paleolithic type showing some superficial Mousterian
analogies. Three major types of lithic artifacts may be recognized: “‘ Choppers and
Scrapers,” “Cores,” and “Complex Scrapers,” and it is a noticeable fact that
where implements of the “‘ Chopper ” or “‘ Scraper ” variety happen to be asymmetrical,
the majority of such are so shaped as to be conveniently adapted for use in the right
hand. On account of the almost complete absence of flinty material, the real stage
reached by the Choukoutien culture is difficult to evaluate.

It would seem highly improbable that there can be any direct evolutionary relationship

between the well-recognized sequence of Western European palzolithic cultures and
that of Choukoutien. Some evidence has indeed been adduced from a comparison of
