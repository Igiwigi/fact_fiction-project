To investigate the point one of the authors proposes, with the kind permission of
Professor Sir Writ1am Brace at the Royal Institution, to have examined there the
actual structures of certain crucial specimens in this region of specially low temperature.
In this direction the microscope does not appear to help, since as stated above
methods for the examination of structures at low temperatures are not available.

The interesting behaviour of nickel, copper, and aluminium make the prospect of
tests on these metals at still lower temperatures very attractive; that is, when present
difficulties of doing so can be overcome. One may reasonably ask, certainly for copper,
whether it is tending towards a condition, at or near the absolute zero, of perfect
ductility.

Finally, there is the interesting fact that carbon, when added to iron in a sufficiently
small amount, namely, about 0-1 to 0-3%, actually helps to prevent it becoming
brittle. Although it is not effective in this way in liquid hydrogen, 7.e., iron is made
brittle at this temperature even with this addition of carbon, it, nevertheless, improves
the ratio by which the tenacity is increased. With a higher carbon addition the
low-temperature properties of the pure iron are deteriorated.

This peculiar effect of carbon is certainly most puzzling, and until a more intimate
knowledge of the changes brought about in the internal structure of metals by low
temperatures is acquired, a complete explanation of this and the other features previously
mentioned can hardly be expected.
