But meanwhile
I communicate this additional instalment of physiological results under the title
* Concluding Observations on the Locomotor System of Medusze.” Possibly enough in
future years various questions concerning the physiology of nerve and muscle may
arise, for the solution of which the primitive nerve and muscle tissues of the Meduse
will afford valuable material ; but for the present, ib seems to me, this paper will
pretty well exhaust the physiology of these tissues, and for this reason I have given it
a title which indicates that the series of communications of which ib is a member may
now be considered as closed.*

1. STIMULATION.

$1. Artificial Rhythn.—(a.) I shall devote the whole of this lengthy section to a
full consideration of what in my previous paper I termed © Artificial Rhythm.” Tt
will be remembered that in my previous paper this subject was alluded to in a foot-
note, of which the following is a copy :—*© As the present communication was originally
accepted by the Royal Society, there here followed a lengthy subsection on * Artificial
Rhythm.” A condensed epitome of the main facts which were detailed in that 8ub-
section may be found in the already published abstract of this paper in the * Pro-
ceedings of the Royal Society.” But as the new theory of ganglionic action, which it
is the main object of this passage to disclose, appears to me a theory of sufficient

* The effects of several poisons still remain to be investigated, and I have till in view a number of
experiments which have not yet been carried ont; but as it is uncertain whether the results of these
further observations will be worth publishing, I have thought it desirable thus to indicate that the work,
80 far as it has now gone, may be regarded as a completed structure. MR. G.
