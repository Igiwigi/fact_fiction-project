either in tension or compression, and the individual stress state of each element is defined by
equilibrium and compatibility conditions.

Figure 4b visualizes a very coarse model to understand the connections between the various
components. Figure 5 shows the fine model that has been used in the following static calculations,
conducted with an in-house software developed specifically for this study. Note that the geometry
of the trusswork has been directly derived from the finite-element discretization that we always
use in continuum models of the cornea [15,19,31] (figure 5a). The trusswork includes 48 sub-
parallel fibrils for each set, 5000 nodal points and 28 600 trusses (figure 5b). The distance between
the anterior and posterior surface of the model is taken to be 0.3mm, inferior to the average
thickness of the cornea (0.5mm). We remark that the model is statically stable also for zero
thickness, and the distance between the anterior and posterior surface is considered only to
obtain a more realistic shape in the keratoconus case. In fact, it is commonly observed that
keratoconus corneas are much thinner in the zone of the conus, and the possibility to fold
into an acute cone shape is also dependent on the reduced thickness. Clearly, an increase of
the thickness increases the global stiffness of the model; therefore, to maintain the number
of parameters at the minimum, we decided to use the same thickness also for the normal
corneas.

Preliminary calculations showed that, for a fixed thickness, the solution of the simplified model
in terms of displacements corresponds to the solution of the corresponding three-dimensional
finite-element model, with an error less than 1%. Therefore, the discretization affects the solution
in the same amount as in any linear elastic finite-element approximation.

The hinges of the trusses resting on the external ring, corresponding to the limbus, are pinned.
