It is evident that the terms in the summa-
tions are connections with the FourtEr series, for rr, and r0,, and we shall find these can
be expressed in terms of two pairs of conjugate functions. The terms outside the
summations, in which alone o occurs, are evidently due to the unbalanced part of the
distribution, and so can be expressed in terms of the “ singularities,”’ i.¢., the average
pressure on the boundary, the force resultant, and the couple resultant of the system. (As a matter of fact, the couple will not appear explicitly in the final formule.)

(6) Singularities. As mentioned in the preceding paragraph, these are the average pressure on the
boundary, P ; the components of the resultant force, X and Y; the moment of the
tractions about the centre of the hole, M. ‘They are given by : Pp xf
