Keywords: studies have been developed to date. This is the most
molecular surgery, molecular hydrogen, joyful outcome of our work. In fact, it is now already
endohedral fullerene an old story, but I would like to describe how and why

we started the study of molecular surgery of Ce9, which
resulted in the creation of H2@Cgo. The idea of molecular surgery of Cg to create
endohedral fullerenes, that is, to make a hole on Cg and
e-mail: komatsu@scl.kyoto-u.ac.jp enlarge it (an ‘incision’), to insert a small guest species,

to reduce the size of the hole and complete enclosure of
the hole (a ‘suture’) without loss of the guest species,
was first proposed by Rubin [1,2] at the University
of California, Los Angeles. This is truly an attractive
methodology for the production of endohedral fullerene,
which had previously relied on rather hard-to-control
physical methods such as arc discharge between carbon
rods containing metal oxides or application of high
pressure /high temperature of noble gases on fullerenes.
