locus V,**; and we see immediately that these are just the planes which meet I,‘
in conics ; for the points of a conic of F,* correspond to lines joining a point of | to the
points of cy.

Also the locus of planes corresponding to points of c, is of order four V,*; and since
one of the planes of K passes through any given point of c., every plane of V,* contains a
generator of F,*, and it is in fact the plane joining the generator to the fixed point O
which corresponds to the plane of c,. Hence V,° is the locus of planes which meet ¥*
in conics and V;! is the locus of planes joining O to the generators of F.*.

{2, 4, 6},.

In this transformation ® is the system of quadrics which contain two skew lines bs,
touch a given plane x at a point T of this plane, and pass through another fiwed point P.
The associated net of curves of A’ consists of cubic curves passing through A,, As, A;
and a fixed point P’ of w, and having a double point at another fixed point T’ of o—
each of these curves being augmented by the conic through Aj, ..., A; and by the line
