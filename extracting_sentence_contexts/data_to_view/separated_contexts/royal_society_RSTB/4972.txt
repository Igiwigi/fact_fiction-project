Tt is clear that in one chromosome of each nucleus the constriction or point of attachment
is at about one-third the total length of the chromosome, but the observations on the
chromosome groups of species of Aloé do not show that this is the structure of three of
the four long chromosomes in this genus, a character which T'ayLor describes in the
nuclei of Alo? arborescens and Aloé saponaria, and suggests as possibly characteristic
of the genus. The occurrence of chromosome constrictions constant in position in the univalent
elements which form the bivalent chromosomes suggests the possibility of tracing the
orientation of paternal and maternal chromosomes which possess such constrictions
or appendages as they come out of the general spireme complex. In plants, where the
weight of evidence is in favour of the origin of the bivalents by an end-to-end arrangement
of the univalents, a differentiation within the chromosome would bring out more clearly

the fact that each homologous pair must lie in such a position that the ends bearing like
“genes”? are together. If, in the paternal chromosome, the characters A, B, 0, D, E
are arranged in that order—the homologous maternal chromosome bearing the characters
A’, B’, CO’, D’, E’—then the arrangement of these on the spireme which gives rise to the
bivalents must be E, D, C, B, A, A’, B’, C’, D’, E’ or A, B, C, D, E, Ei’, D’, C’, B’, A’,
the next pair of chromosomes being similarly adjusted. If a “ telosynapsis ” interpre-
tation of the method of evolution of the bivalent chromosome in plants is correct, and
if “ crossing over ’’ of factors occurs in any such plants, then it would appear that the
above arrangement must hold (‘‘telosynapsis”’ and “crossing over” shown for Lathyrus.
