we have preponderant Betula, and a fair density of herbaceous pollen types including
substantial amounts of several genera highly typical of Late-Glacial conditions, such as
Artemisia, Thalictrum and Polemonium, together with smaller amounts of Helianthemum and
Plantago. (Small amounts of these and others continue into zone IV.) Furthermore, in
the zone III muds the tree-pollen diagram shows a certain proportion of the pollen
of warmth-demanding trees, Corylus, Tilia and Alnus, which may fairly be supposed to
have been derived, along with the Adies (not native in the Post-Glacial in Britain), from
erosion of older deposits.

It will be noted that not only are both species of tree-birch recorded from macroscopic
remains in the pollen samples in zone V, but that Betula nana has also persisted to this
stage, a fact not out of line with its behaviour recorded elsewhere in western Europe in
general and East Anglia in particular.
