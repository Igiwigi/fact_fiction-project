It may be said that the case of three or more equal roots existing in F (a, y) has been

- turnedintoan operator becomes a%* E -) (! 3) which, applied to the Hessian, viz. 3aeu't*+ ftv" —e, after

multiplying by —75, gives K=—2c&, 80 that D=J?—128K=aif*+2560%, which is capable of easy verifi-
cation, In fact D becomes the resultant, of au'+ev! and v(4eu+fv); v* introduces the factor a* into D; and
further, making u: v::—F#: 4e and substituting in au'+ev!, we obtain the other factor af *+ 2566,

If we adopt w*+5euv* +»! as the reduced form for the failing case (a form analogous to the well-known one,
u+6en?-+v*, for the general quartic), to find e we have J= 4, K=—2p%, Hence =— 29 thus when
K=0, e=0.
