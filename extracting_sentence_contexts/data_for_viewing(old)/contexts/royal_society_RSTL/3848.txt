Tr important although obscure functions attributed to the elementary body
pbosphorus, both in the vegetable and in the animal kingdoms, and the well-known
fact that rocks of nearly every description afford on disintegration soils more or less
capable of supporting the life of plants, and from which consequently phosphoric acid
cannot possibly be absent, seemed to render a search for that substance in rocks of
igneous origin generally very desirable, because if there found, an easy and satisfactory
explanation of the origin and first source of the element in question would be given.
As I am not aware that any direct researches on this subject have yet been made,
or at least placed on record, I yenture to submit to the notice of the Royal Society
the results of a few experiments made by myself, which, so far as they go, resolve the
question in the affirmative.

The first s8ubstance tried was the fine white porcelain-clay of Dartmoor, Devon,
the result of the disintegration of the felspar of the granite of that district. This is
one of the chief components of porcelain and of the finer kinds of English earthen-
