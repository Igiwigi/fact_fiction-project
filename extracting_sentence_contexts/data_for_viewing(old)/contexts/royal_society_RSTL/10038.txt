standstill caused by vagus stimulation are much weaker than the normal contractions,
and Nui# has shown that stimulation of the nerve weakens, ab all events the
auricular contractions, even without a preliminary standstill.

We have, therefore, according to present views at leasb, three sets of fibres in the
Frog's vagus, viz. : fibres which are capable of slowing or entirely preventing the dis-
charges from the motor ganglia ; fibres which accelerate those discharges ; and fibres
which in s0me way or other diminish the force of the cardiac contractions. In addition,
we have various statements that sometimes only one vagus is active, thab ab certain
times of the year the vagus loses all power, &c.

The literature of the snbject then affords ample evidence of considerable discrepancy
not, only as to the explanation of the action of the vagus, but also as to observed facts
connected with that action. The reason of this confusion will appear in the following
pages, and I will say at present that it is based upon a view of the nature of the
action of the vagus, which appears to me to be too much one-sided. Too great promi-
nence has hitherto been assigned to the action of the nerve upon the motor gangliaâ€”
too little to its action upon bhe muscular tissue.

The moxst striking feature of vagus stimulation is a more or less prolonged standstill
of the heart. There is no reason prior; to assign this standstill to the action of the
nerve upon the rate of the discharges from the motor ganglia rather than to its action
upon the muscular tissue of the heart. Either conception is perfectly possible, and its

truth can be tested directly by experiment.
