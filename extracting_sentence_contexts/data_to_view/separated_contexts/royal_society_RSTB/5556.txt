It may, however, be remarked that the force with which Darwin launched this
principle led subsequently to some unjustifiable conclusions, for most instances of
divergence came to be regarded on a priori grounds as indicating distant relationship
and most instances of convergence to denote close affinity. It was under such a mis-
apprehension that GASKELL came to believe in the relationships of the fish Cephalaspis
and the trilobites Paradoxides and Olenellus. Brpper (1927) has shown that the
apparent similarity between the trilobites and the fish is due to the fact that both
were shaped to resist destruction from the torrential currents of the Silurian Seas. Similar forms are met with to-day among the fauna of the torrential streams, and I
need only refer here to the larve of the insects Prosopistoma (p. 194) and Psephenus
(p. 202), both of which were at first regarded as Crustaceans of the Apus type. The

movement of one segment over the other is possible.
