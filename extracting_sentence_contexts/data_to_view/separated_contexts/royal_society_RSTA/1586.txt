To identify instantaneous dehydration embrittlement in the geologic record, we would look
for transient deformation features (i.e. highly localized shear zones) in close association with the
mineral reaction products. Interestingly, examples of shear instabilities associated directly with
lawsonite dehydration reactions in exhumed rocks have thus far not been documented. There are
in fact several descriptions of pristine lawsonite pseudomorphs formed on the prograde path with
no evidence for closely associated brittle faulting or localized shear strain [259-264]. By contrast,
there are a few examples of shear slip generated in close association with antigorite dehydration
in the field [245,265]. Some of the best examples come from the Voltri Massif (Erro Tobbio unit)
in the Italian Alps where partially hydrated peridotite bodies and serpentinite mylonites exhibit
synkinematic shear bands and hydraulic fractures decorated with fine-grained reaction products
of antigorite breakdown [266-268].
