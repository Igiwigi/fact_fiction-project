The conservation of helicity is associated with a rotational symmetry [52] which
in infinitesimal form is

E>E+0B and B>B-9E, (2.2)

with @ an infinitesimal Lorentz pseudoscalar angle. This sees the electric and magnetic field
vectors of each plane-wave mode comprising the electromagnetic field rotated about the
wavevector k of the mode through @ [47,53], as depicted in figure 2. The existence of this
symmetry embodies the idea of electric-magnetic democracy [54]: the fact that the electric and
magnetic fields reside on equal footing in the strict absence of charge [45,46,50,55,56]. Looking at

'The prefix ‘pseudo’ signifies unusual transformation properties under a parity inversion. For example, a pseudoscalar
changes sign under a parity inversion, whereas a scalar does not; a pseudovector does not change sign under a parity
inversion, whereas a vector does [2].
