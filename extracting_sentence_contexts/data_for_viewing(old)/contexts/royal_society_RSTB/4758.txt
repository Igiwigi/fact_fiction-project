Fic. 3—Hassr’s diagrams of cyclospondylous (1), tectospondylous (2), and asterospondylous (3)
vertebre, representing transverse sections of anterior caudal vertebrie of the three types, cut midway
between the anterior and posterior ends of the centrum,

A, radiating lamelle characteristic of asterospondylous vertebr ; C, remains of the notochord ;
D, primary double-cone calcification of the middle-zone cartilage; E, membrana elastica externa,
the outer limit of the notochordal sheath ; H, hemal arch ; N, neural arch ; T, one of the concentric
lamelle characteristic of tectospondylous vertebra, The cartilage next internal to the ring D is
inner-zone cartilage, that between the rings D and E is outer-zone cartilage. Copied from Hassr
(15, A, pp. 41, 44, 48).

The groups of fishes as delimited by Hass are, with certain exceptions, natural
groups, which is to be accounted for by the fact that his ultimate classification was
not based upon the characters of the vertebre solely; he wisely took also into
consideration the characters of the placoid scales and teeth, the basal cartilages of
the pectoral fin, and the presence or absence of an anal fin, and in difficult cases,
where the features of the centra did not provide the confirmatory evidence that he
needed, he was inclined to disregard, or at all events to belittle, the value of such
evidence, with the result that his definitions regarding the patterns of the vertebral
centra fail to be strictly applicable throughout the groups in question.

Cyclospondyly.

Hassr’s Plagiostomi cyclospondyli comprise the sharks and dog-fishes that are
included within the first division of the family Squalide as delimited by Re@an (29,
