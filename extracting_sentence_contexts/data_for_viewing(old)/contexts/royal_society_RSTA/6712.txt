Ficure 17. Measurement of diamond lattice constant from position of 313, 133 Cu Ke, intersection
relative to the 220 Cu Ka, and a, lines. Abscissae give lattice constant of diamond, uncorrected for
temperature, but using wave-lengths corrected for refractive index. Ordinates give angles OQ
measured from direction of cube axis. 4mm. on photographic print approx. equals 7 min. of arc.

The obvious advantage of a method such as this, which depends only on the position of a
point relative to two lines in its very close neighbourhood, is that no precision apparatus is
required. In fact, the film was held in a light-tight envelope, by a retort stand placed at
about 1 m. from the crystal. The exactness of the distance does not matter, nor does the
exact orientation of the film relative to the crystal axes and anticathqde surface, as long as
the 220 Cu Ka, and a, lines are well resolved. Their actual separation on the photograph
before enlargement was 2 mm. and the apparent (visual) width of each line about 0-5 mm.

It will be clear that since we are now concerned with the second place of decimals of X
units, the refractive index of the diamond for Cu K radiation must be taken into account.
