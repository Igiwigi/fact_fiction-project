fluoric acid, is similar to that of muriatic acid gas, occasioning
a disengagement of silicated fluoric acid. gas. Facts which
appear to prove, that water is absolutely essential to the exist-
ence of this acid.

Boracic acid decomposes it, in a very different way, not from
any predominant affinity for the water, but in consequence of
a stronger attraction for the fluoric acid itself. Silicated fluoric
acid of course is not produced ; but liquid fluoboracic acid and
the silex is precipitated in a gelatinous state, as when ammonia
is employed.

Thezse are the principal facts I have to notice respecting this
acid. Before I conclude, I shall briefly mention a few other
circumstances. Applied to the tongue, in its concentrated state,
it produces a very painful sensation, like that which strong
muriatic acid does, and it has a very similar effect on the
cuticle. It does not appear-to erode-glass, for I have kept it in
