This is maintained
as far as the peripheral region of the thickened ectoderm. As a whole, however, it is
so insignificant in thickness, so ill-defined, and so wide in its lateral extension, that
at first one hesitates in recognising in it the zone of approaching protovertebral
segmentation. Comparison with subsequent stages shows, nevertheless, quite
conclusively, that the whole of this feebly indicated paraxial zone of mesoderm does,
in fact, correspond to the region occupied by the future somites. Possible indications
of commencing protovertebral segmentation have been alluded to in connection with
the photomicrographs in figs. 22 and 23.
