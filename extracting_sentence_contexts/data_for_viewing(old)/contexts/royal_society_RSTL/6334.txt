same definition is more concisely repeated by M. D'ORBIGNY in his latest publication on
the subject, notwithstanding that the true structure of Polystomella crispa had in the
mean time been elucidated by Professor WILLIAMSON in his admirable memoir on that
species; the genus Polystomella being still defined (in the * Cours Elementaire de Pal6-
ontologie et de G6ologie Stratigraphiques,' tom. ii. p. 197) © Coquille nautiloide, pourrue
de nombreuses ouyertures sur la derniere loge et sur les cot6s de la coquille; une cavits

174. I have already referred, in my General Introduction, to the elaborate inquiry of
Professor WILLIAMSON into the organization of Polystomella crispayh, as having not only
established several important facts in regard to its minute structure, but as having fur-
nished the starting-point for all future investigations of the same kind : it now becomes
necessary that I should somewhat fully recapitulate the most important features of his
description, in order that it may be seen in what points my own inquiries upon a more
developed form of the same group have evolved results supplementary to his. To the
accuracy of his descriptions I can bear the fullest testimony ; having not only had the
opportunity, through the kindness of Professor WILLIAMSON, of examining the prepara-
tions still in his possession both of the shell and of the animal of Polystomella crispa,
but having carried out an independent investigation upon specimens collected by
myself.

175. On the exterior of each of the segmental divisions of the shell of P. erispa, strong
transverse crenulations present themselves, which are deepest near the convex margin of
