In our simulations, among
5723 molecules participating in 5994 annotated reactions, only 47 small-molecules or classes
thereof act as catalysts. We use classes as ‘flavins’, ‘nads’, ‘folates’ and ‘divalent cation’ to equate
structurally or chemically similar catalysts, which generalizes catalysis even more than what is
natural in the cell. Finally, because ATP is a monomer of RNA, in agreement with others we are
confident that the origin of ATP before the origin of RNA is quite parsimonious—in fact, it seems
to be a necessity, given the difficulty to polymerize NMPs directly to RNA. Because ATP allows
for much more chemically than polymerization, it is parsimonious to assume that other chemical
reactions occurred in the same chemical niche where ATP originated, before and concurrently
with its polymerization with other bases to form RNA strands. There are, however, and despite confounding criticism addressed, significant and real
weaknesses in the model that we hope to be addressed in the future.
