Additional analysis of our data using a Pearson corre-
lation confirmed this previous finding [33] (electronic
supplementary material, figure S1). In this study, we investigated the relationship between per-
sonality and individual influence on collective movement in
homing pigeons. Past studies investigating this relationship
typically focused on the single most influential member of
a group, despite the fact that many animal groups, including
homing pigeons [29], have distributed leadership, meaning
that more than one individual can influence collective move-
ment [25]. Our results showed, for the first time, that bold
individuals were more likely to occupy not only the highest
rank but also the subsequent upper ranks in leadership hier-
archies. This trend was observed irrespective of navigational
context; the same pattern was detected during free flights
around the lofts as in homing flights.
