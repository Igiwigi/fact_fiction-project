do for them all. The notable points of difference from 7'm. Vieillardi lie in the absence
of medullary xylem, the sclerenchymatous nature and pitting of the pith and, so far
as observed, in the fact that the sieve-plates are always uniseriate.

Concerning the distribution of the phloem, my conclusions with regard to this species
are the same as in the case of 7’m. Viedllardi. Fig. 25, Plate 6, from a median longitudinal
section through the leafy stem, shows clearly a sieve-tube (iph) abutting on the one
side wpon a xylem strand and on the other upon the pith (p). It is not possible to
assert definitely that the phloem on the inner face of each xylem strand forms a
complete and unbroken layer. In fact, sections have been met with in which pith-like
cells were seen directly in contact with the xylem ; but such cases are not common.

The number of stelar bundles is smaller than in 7'm. Vieillardi, a fact evidently related
to the less crowded leaves. The vascular supply to the leaves and fertile organs was
carefully studied in paraffin sections, and on the question of leaf-gaps the conclusions
drawn in the case of T’m. Vieillardi were fully confirmed.

Young Plant.—Among the much branched rhizomes I found a young specimen
consisting of two leafy shoots arising from the same rhizome (Plate 5, fig. 9). The
anatomy of this specimen was studied in microtome sections. As Ho~uowayt has
meanwhile published an account of the young plant, I need not go over the same ground,
for my observations agree with his description. ‘The main point is that the simple stele
of the rhizome is continued unbroken into the aerial shoot.

The form lanceolata shows an even stronger contrast to I'm. Vieillardi, because of
