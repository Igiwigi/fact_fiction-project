to anon-thermalizing MBL phase [42-44]. However, what comes very close to a picture of non-ergodicity is the fact that the IPR as
defined above, depending on a local operator O;, does decrease when one moves away from
the Griffiths region. Roughly, one finds

dependence has been predicted by the theory of [7] and confirmed numerically (figure 8).
