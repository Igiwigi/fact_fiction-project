XXII. Electro-Chemical Researches, on the Decomposition of the
Earths; with Observations on the Metals obtained from the
alkaline Earths, and on the Amalgam procured from Ammonta.
By Humphry Davy, Esq. Sec. R.S. M.R.T. A.

1. Introduction.

Ix the Philosophical Transactions for 1807, Part I. and 1808,
Part I. I have detailed the general methods of decomposi-
tion by electricity, and stated various new facts obtained in
consequence of the application of them.

The results of the experiments on potash and soda, as I
stated in my last communication to the Society, afforded me
the strongest hopes of being able to effect the decomposition
both of the alkaline and common earths; and the phenomena
obtained in the first imperfect trials made upon those bodies
countenanced the ideas | that had obtained from the earliest
periods of chemistry, of their being metallic in their nature.*

* Beccues is the first chemist, as far as my reading informs me, who distinctly
pointed out the relations of metals to earthy substances, see Phys, subt, Lipsiz, 4to.
