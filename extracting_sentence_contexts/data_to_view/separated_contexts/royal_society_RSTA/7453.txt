In the subsequent analyses of the mixtures of unknown composition
(withdrawn from the adsorption experiments) duplicate analyses were made and the
close concordance between the results of the two independent analyses is an indication
of the reliability of the technique.

(d) The oxygen content of oxygen-hydrogen mixtures

Test analysis: A mixture of the pure dry gases was made up containing 50-46%
oxygen. Results of three separate analyses of this mixture:

Volume of residual Oxygen content

Volume of gas after removal found

mixture taken of oxygen %
(1) 13-873 6-873 50-46
(2) 14-133 7-004 50-44
(3) 13-475 6-675 50-46

Duplicate analyses of six different oxygen-hydrogen mixtures:

Ist analysis 2nd analysis
Mixture % oxygen % oxygen
(1) 50-11 50-11
(2) 49-66 49-66
(3) 48-38 48-38
(4) 48-23 48-23
(5) 49-72 49-73
(6) 49-75 49-75

(e) The oxygen content of oxygen-carbon monoxide mixtures

The determination of the exact composition of mixtures of these two gases presented
an unexpectedly difficult problem. The normal method of determining the oxygen content—by the removal of this
gas with alkaline hydrosulphite and the subsequent measurement of the ‘residual gas”
—was found to be inaccurate owing to the fact that carbon monoxide combines slowly,
even at ordinary temperatures and pressures, with caustic alkali solutions. Careful
experiments made with simple aqueous (dilute) caustic soda solutions showed that
carbon monoxide was absorbed at the rate of about 0-1 c.c./hr. under the conditions
obtaining in the absorption pipette; qualitative tests on the product showed the
presence of formate in the alkali solution. The determination of the carbon monoxide content by burning this gas, with a
measured excess of oxygen (in the combustion pipette), removing the carbon dioxide
by absorption, and measuring the volume of oxygen unused, was found to be unreliable
because of the impossibility of preventing traces of tap-grease from reaching the
