determining whether an element is superconducting or not.

Still another way to look at the ‘broken covalency’ approach is to treat the d° occupation as
the one corresponding to a very stable d—d bonding, which leads to facile sigma, pi and delta
overlap in the solid state, with all d electrons attaining the metal-metal bonding character and not
being prone to electron delocalization and potential superconductivity. Indeed, one pronounced
T, minimum in metallic alloys falls at the formal electron count around 5 (figure 11). It turns
out that when this stable configuration is broken via introduction of a small amount of holes
(vacancies), a pronounced T; maximum appears at 4.7 d electrons for alloys, which is known
as the Matthias rule [9,36]. Yet another but smaller T, maximum is seen experimentally at the
electron count of 6.5 [9,36]. Remarkably, both discussed d-electron counts coincide with the
well-known borderlines between the bec/hep and hep/fce structures of elemental transition
metals [44]. This correlation is not casual, we think, and it emphasizes the fact that the same
lattice instabilities that drive structural distortions at room temperature may also be at the
origin of the strong electron-phonon coupling in those transition metals which superconduct at
low temperature.

7. Concluding remarks

Our aim here is to highlight this approach for the transition metal series and in particular a
qualitative account of the T, systematics of transition metals, most notably the first transition
series. We have highlighted approaches that characterize the strength of the important electron—
phonon interaction in transition metals by two experimentally derived parameters. One of these,
Vp, is closely associated with, and characteristic of, chemical covalent bonding. From these
discussions, we hope to have developed a conceptual understanding of the T, systematics of
