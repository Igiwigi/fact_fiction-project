The mode of action of this temperature
rise in Gasterosteus is to set in action a chain of events which leads to the spawning
season. If this chain develops slowly there will be a considerable lag between the
breeding season and the temperature rise which has conditioned it. This, it is suggested,
may possibly be the explanation of the fact that many species which spawn in spring
or summer in temperate climates, spawn in late summerin higher latitudes. (For example,
Coregonus, which spawns in spring in Central Europe and in autumn in North Canada.)

Spermatogenesis may be in progress or it may be completed at the beginning of the
spawning season. In Gasterosteus it is usually completed prior to the spawning season,
but there are numerous exceptions. THREE-SPINED STICKLEBACK, GASTEROSTEUS ACULEATUS. 271

The state of spermatogenesis at time of spawning varies with the length of the
spawning season in a number of cases I have examined.
