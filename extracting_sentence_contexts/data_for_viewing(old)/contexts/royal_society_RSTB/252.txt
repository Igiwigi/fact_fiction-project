SR. radiata not only were the cups small and simple compared with the discs of
gh. batis, but the entire organ was only a few inches in length, and only about 8 mm.
3 in circumference at its thickest central portion. When, however, I found that the
cups in R. cireularis were large well moulded bodies, with an electric plate nearly as
© extensive as the electric plate of the disc of FR. batis; that the electric organ of 2.
fullonica, which also consists of cups, was relatively large and well developed ; and
that the development of the cups in 2. radiata was extremely slow ; and also that,
instead of showing signs of degenerating, they continued to increase in size in the
adult forms, it was no longer possible to feel so confident that all the electric organs
consisting of cups had been arrested in their development.

Further investigation convinced me that the electric cups were quite distinct struc-
tures; that, in fact, while in some Skates the electric elements had assumed the form
of dises (e.g., R. batis and R. clavata), in others they had taken the form of cups (¢..,
R. cireularis and R. fullonica); and that it was as unlikely that a fully developed

a cup.*
