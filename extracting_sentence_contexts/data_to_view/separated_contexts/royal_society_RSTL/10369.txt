Moreover, the
compound arrangement might be of very compact form. There was one objection
which, though of no importance in most applications for purposes of integration, was
a serious one for certain applications of the converse process. This was the fact that
the movable centres, nobwithstanding the great range of velocity ratio, could neyer
take such a position as to give the limiting values in either direction. This is shown
at once by fig. 12, where it is seen that to do this, that is, for a to become 0? or 90*
the movable centres would have to come into contact with the other rollers A A‚Äù or
B B'. It mus not be overlooked that although the roller centres are nominally in
contact at a point, yet that really the sphere, in turning, twists upon the movable
centres at its equator, while motion of the movable frame causes the supporting rollers
to twist upon the sphere at its poles.
