became a matter of interest to ascertain whether changes in the mass of water itself
had any influence on the composition of the salts contained in these coloured solu-
tions.

The only methods which occurred to me of obtaining an answer to this inquiry,
were, to ascertain whether dilution caused any greater or less decrease of colour in
some $ubstances than in others of the same tint ; and whether the decrease of colour
by dilution was uniform in the same salt, by whatever mixture it might be produced.

It has frequently been noticed that a red solation of ferric sulphocyanide is reduced
by the addition of water more than the simple dilution seemed capable of account-
ing for, and more than the red meconate is. In examining this matter, it seemed
desirable first to ascertain how far it might be the fact. For this purpose two solu-
tions were taken; the one of the purest sesquisu]phocyanide of iron I could obtain,
the other of pure ferric meconate. They were made up to the same colour and the
same volume, and were then equally diluted. . It became at once evident that the
addition of water produced far greater difference in the colour of the snIphocyanide
than in that of the meconate; but the exact proportion could not be determined,
as, although the two reds were almost identical in shade at first, the sulphocyanide

assumed on dilution a yellowish, and the meconate a pink hue. Numerical results,
however, were obtained from the comparison of two mixtures, the one consisting of
