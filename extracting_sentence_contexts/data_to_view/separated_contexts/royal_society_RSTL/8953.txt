If the
Z polypite, for instance, while i 8, is continually supplying a gentle stimulus to the
A marginal ganglia, when it is suddenly cut off, the nerve-tracts through which this
stimulating influence had previously been conveyed must be cut through ; and as it is
well known hoy irritable nerve-fibres are at their points of section, it is to be expected
that the irritation caused by cutting these nerve-tracts, and probably also the action of
the sea-water on their cut extremities, would cause them to stimulate the ganglia more
powerfully than they did before their mutilation. And here I may state that on several
occasions, with vigorous specimens, I have observed a sudden removal of the polypite to
be followed, not merely with a quickening of the rhythm on the part of the bell, but
with a violent and long-sustained spasm. Again, as regards the other fact before us, it
is obvious that as s0on as the cut extremities of the nerves begin to die down, and s0

gradually to lose their irritability, the effect on the rhythm would be just what we
obzerve it to be, viz. a gradual slowing till the rate falls considerably below that which
was exhibited by the unmutilated animal.
