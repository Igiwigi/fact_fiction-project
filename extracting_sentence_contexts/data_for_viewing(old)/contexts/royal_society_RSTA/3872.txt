type of pulse leads to a unique initial crack in the specimens which allowed the tensile strength
to be properly calculated.

The local concentration of stresses due to the incident bar impact on concrete was successfully
avoided with the inclusion of a small steel disc on the impact end. Compression wave was
progressively transferred to the specimen without local failure and minimizing three-dimensional
dispersion effects.

Just one type of concrete has been tested, as the main scope of this work is to validate a new
spalling configuration for the dynamic characterization of concrete. The dynamic tensile strength
was calculated analytically using the information recorded in the strain gauges. Results show very
uniform values for almost all of the specimens which reached tensile resistances up to 15 MPa
depending on the strain rate. Although this was not a fact considered in this work, it is important
to give a relationship with the strain rate, as it influences significantly the values of dynamic
tensile strength reached. In this way, the aim was to have a constant projectile velocity and so a
constant strain rate at the moment of fracture, but controlling this magnitude was not an easy task
as it depended on different parameters such as gas pressure and friction between Teflon discs on
the projectile and inner part of the cannon. Even if gas pressure was adjusted to a constant value,
the existing friction changed in each test due to the wear of Teflon modifying the velocities that
reached at the exit of the cannon.

In the early tests, two strain gauges were placed in the specimen. The idea of setting two
strain gauges in primary tests was done to see the evolution of the wave after being transmitted
from incident bar to concrete specimen. From the records in both gauges, as seen in table 4, it is
noted that a variation of the pulse exists from the first to the second gauge. This variation can
