on transverse section as “ refractile dots in some places, in others they are deeply
“stained.” ;

In my sections of developing enamel where these structures are cut across, they
appear most often as homogeneous dots, rarely as though the axial area was of a
slightly different consistency from the periphery, and in a very few cases they are
annular. In sections prepared by grinding dry teeth the tubular appearance is
somewhat more frequent. I have never observed any appearances to suggest that
these structures invest a protoplasmic process, and the difference in the staining
properties in peripheral and central regions is one of degree only, suggesting a
difference in physical consistency due to surface phenomena.

The developmental facts presented later in this paper negative the interpretation
of the tubular form as the normal one, and I consider the term “ fibril” affords a
much more accurate description of these structures, both as regards their form and
their mode of origin, and have employed the word to designate these structures
throughout this paper.

These fibrils are most richly developed in the teeth of Macropodidee, where,
according to Tomrs, they exist in the proportion of about one to every four enamel
prisms. They are not equally distributed throughout the enamel, but are most
frequent where the enamel is thickest, and do not extend quite to the surface, the
outer portion of the enamel being devoid of them. In other families they are less
abundant, while in the Wombat, alone of Marsupials, they are entirely absent.
