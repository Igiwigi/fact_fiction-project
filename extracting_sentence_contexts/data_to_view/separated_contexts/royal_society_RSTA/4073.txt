In the present 22
NCYL model, the inner fibre core is surrounded by (N â€” 1) matrix layers. During the process a}
of damage evolution, the damage occurring in the discrete matrix layers is identified based on : =
the calculation of the strain and stress fields, whereas the undamaged matrix layers retain their : S
virgin properties. It is important to emphasize the fact here that, in the 2CYL model, the entire : gS

volume of matrix material was degraded by the same amount, as it is not possible to restrict
damage to a particular region of matrix volume. As a result, the model overpredicts the stiffness
and the nonlinear stress-strain response. This limitation is eliminated by the NCYL model and
the radius of the discrete damage zone can be controlled as an input variable to this model.
