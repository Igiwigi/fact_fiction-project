when statistics of this kind are collected, and more than one son in a family is
included. There is a more significant difference in the variation of wives and
daughters. It is, however, in the opposite sense to what we may suppose would
be produced by natural selection, or by the fact that we have drawn daughters from
aless general population than wives. There is no definite evidence as to natural
selection to be drawn from these results accordingly.

(ii.) Sexual Selection.—(a.) Preferential Mating.—We have no general populations
to compare with those of husbands and wives. If we suppose the population stable,
and treat sons and daughters as characteristic of the general unmarried population,

Shusbands are not a significant selection from sons. Possibly the difference between
igthe variation in daughters and wives might be accounted for by a distaste for very tall

Beant, but it should be borne in mind in dealing with a larger range of statistics.
