(1) A cylinder subjected to a uniform tension T.
(2) A rectangular plate bent into the form of a right cylindrical surface.
(3) Torsion of a right circular cylinder.

Virtually, Sarnt-VENANT’s semi-inverse method has been used in all the three cases.
Frequent applications have also been made of his “ principle of the elastic equivalence
of statically equipollent systems of load.”

7—Comparison with experimental results

Various authors have drawn attention to the fact that the elongation produced
in a wire is not always proportional to the stretching force even when we remain

within the limits of perfect elasticity. GrrstNer* assumed an empirical relation
of the form

T= As + Bs? + Cs + Dst + ..., JURE SRLS STS)

T being the tension and 5 the total stretch. His experiments led him to the
conclusion that C, D, etc., are all zero, and that B is negative. Later in 1844,
Hopckinsont confirmed this result. The names of WERTHEIM? and Tuompson§
