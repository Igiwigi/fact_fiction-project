one detached rootlet is seen near the main axis, and this is cut in transverse section,
and is like those still embedded in the cortex. Round the rootlets in the cortex near
their point of exit is a sheath of cells separating them from the cortex in which they
lie. Most of these strands are cut, naturally, in oblique and longitudinal directions,
though a few are seen transversely.

Tn one such case (see Phot, 47, Plate 7), the rootlet seems to have no metaxylem
differentiated, but there are four, perhaps five, groups of protoxylem elements much
as appears in the living family. In the pith of the rootlets are a few of the brown
secretory cells, of which there are also a number outside the wood elements.

Habit.—From the anatomy of the large axis there appears to be no question but
that it is of stem nature. The fact, however, that its only appendages are roots,
and that there are so many of them, strongly suggests that it was a rhizome, or at
least the basal portion of a stem. The complete absence of any bands or wedges
of sclerenchyma, or any form of strengthening tissue, supports the idea of a rhizome,
as does the placing of the vascular bundles towards the centre of an undifferentiated
cortex, and the walled uninterrupted cork layer.

Saururus, with which the fossil has many points of likeness, has aerenchyma tissue,
which it retains to some extent even when not growing in its natural habitat,
aswamp. ‘There is no such tissue in the fossil, which has a fairly compact cortical
tissue, like Houttuynia, and was, as a consequence, probably growing on ordinary soil.

The fossil may be imagined as a fairly thick stem or rhizome, with a corky
