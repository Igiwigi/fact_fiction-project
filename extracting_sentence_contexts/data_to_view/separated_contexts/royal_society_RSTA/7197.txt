The slopes are tabulated as the negatives of the gradients
of log, ¢ against (kT)~! at the temperatures — 190 and 290° C, so that they may be compared
directly with the conventional thermal activation energies of other semi-conductors. The
final column in each table contains approximate values of the thermoelectric power of
the films; however, these numbers are only given to one significant figure, as the apparatus
was not designed to measure thermoelectric effects accurately. A number of interesting facts emerge from a consideration of the results. The conductivity-
temperature characteristics of the sequence obtained by dosing with oxygen almost exactly
