so that population density, after allowing for accidental deaths, should have been at least
thirty animals per acre. By actual count only twenty adults are known to have been alive
on block Q.

The young marked in June had almost completely disappeared, and even among males
—where there is no reasonable doubt about the age groupings (§ 3)—there were only two
young for every adult in the samples (table 4). Allowance must be made for inadequate
sampling of the young, but the data suggest that numbers may have been little if any
greater than in May. The trace index had, however, gone up.
