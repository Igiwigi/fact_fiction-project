amalgam cannot be kept immersed in water even for a few instants without the for-
mation of ammonia, yet as long as it is connected with the negative electrode of the
battery, it may be preserved without change for days and weeks. The instant the
connexion with the battery is broken, a mass of this amalgam, as large as a walnut,
appears to vanish in a few seconds, torrents of minute bubbles being given off, and a
scarcely appreciable quantity of mercury being left on the wire. On again closing
the connexion with the battery decomposition recommences, and the amalgam is re-
produced.

20. From a review of the results of these experiments, we cannot help being struck
with the very energetic power of electric currents of weak tension ; currents of suffi-
cient energy to reduce to the metallic state oxides on which currents of higher ten-
8ion from large batteries are comparatively powerless. This fact, although pointed
out by BzcqQuertL and other philosophers, has (as far as I am aware) never been
before shown to hold good in the reduction of the alkaline metals. Potassium and
ammonium not having, I believe, been previously obtained by the weak current ema-
nating from the chemical action of saline soJutions on a single pair of plates; and
Silicon, although obtained by BzcquertL combined with iron, has not been procured
before in a pure state by electric currents, at least by those of feeble tensionÂ®.

In conclusion I may be permitted to observe, that in applying weak electric cur-
rents to the reduction of metallic oxides, it is absolutely necessary that a continuous
current be employed, and that its cessation even for an instant is often fatal to the $uc-
cess of the experiment on hand, which cessation or suspension, as far as my experi-
ments have gone, the modification I haye proposed of Professor DaxiguL's battery
