Sit may fairly be questioned whether the diminution of power to act resides in them or

tration by most irritants, appears to prove that the chromatophorous cells are them-
8lves also affected with loss of power; for, as has been before alluded to, the withdrawal
of nervous influence from them in a healthy state of the tissues invariably gives rise to
Uffusion, and the same result would necessarily follow the action of an irritant which
merely paralysed the nerves. I have also observed, on two occasions, after the energetic
operation of an irritant upon a part of a web containing a large artery, that drawing

upon by irritants as the capillaries of the dermis. This is most marked in large frogs with thick webs. In
