For the traceless version of :F
the quadratic theory, the prediction for the tensor-to-scalar ratio is given by, r= 12/ (b?N2), with ia
b #1 is the new condition necessarily required in the traceless version [78]. (Here N stands for the :=
e-fold function that measures the length of inflation, while b is the crucial new arbitrary constant Da
related to the scale invariance of the potential when we scale the field in traceless theory.) This :3
theory accommodates any r-value however small. aed

(i) Cosmological stability 78

We mentioned in Part A of this survey that the most important property of the Einstein static :8
universe was its transient character. This is based on its instability, as in the Eddington—Lemaitre —
cosmology. In fact, the issue of the instability of the Einstein static universe is much wider, and :
has been investigated by different authors who proved instability in various current contexts. Starting with a radiation-filled Einstein universe, instability was shown in terms of
inhomogeneous oscillatory modes [79], or in a fluid-filled model with respect to conformal metric
perturbations (where the interesting result is that there are regions of stability depending on the
sound speed) [80,81]. Studies of instability were then exploited by Ellis & Maartens to introduce
the emergent universe [82], where in the context of inflationary cosmology, the Einstein static model
serves as a prequel to the inflationary stage: an transient initial state with matter being a scalar
field whose vacuum energy determines the cosmological constant of the model.
