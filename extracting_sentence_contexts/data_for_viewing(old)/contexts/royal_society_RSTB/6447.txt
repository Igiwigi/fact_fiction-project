sessile hydatid. Grirrirus (1893) also failed to find such a connexion, and he declares
that all small spermatozoa-containing cysts originate in dilatations of the tubules of
the coni vasculosi, and that all large cysts of similar character develop as dilatations
of vasa efferentia.

We have discussed this matter somewhat fully, since in one of the specimens we
ourselves examined (O.M. 135 B, p. 158) there undoubtedly was a connexion between
a tubule of the epididymis and a hydatid whose form was typical of those that are
derived from the cranial end of the Miillerian duct. The difficulty of explaining a
communication between derivatives of the Miillerian and Wolffian ducts was fully
realized by Roru. According to him, however, such an intercommunicating vas
aberrans is occasionally present in the female, and connects a fimbria of the Fallopian
tube with the epodphoron.* In spite of the fact that in normal development the
Wolffian duct never communicates with the coelomic cavity, Roru, following WALDEYER
(1877), therefore found it necessary to postulate that the Wolffian and Miillerian
ducts can form a secondary communication at their cranial endsâ€”such as occurs
normally in selachians.

The observations we have considered above may be summarized as follows. Usually
one, occasionally two, and rarely more, minute appendages are attached to either the
upper pole of the testis, to the tissue filling the interval between the testis and the head
of the epididymis, or to the head of the epididymis. These structures are usually
sessile, but may occasionally be pedunculated. Their form varies from minute cysts,
lined by ciliated columnar epithelium, to small bodies closely resembling a miniature
fimbriated end of a Fallopian tube. Every form of hydatid which falls under this
