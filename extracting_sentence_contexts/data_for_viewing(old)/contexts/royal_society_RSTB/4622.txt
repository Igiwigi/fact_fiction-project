the newly-hatched larvze being fed with saliva by large larvee or nymphs. The
large-headed forms (which ultimately develop into soldiers and workers) receive only a
very small amount of saliva, as is shown by the woody or fiecal colour of the intestinal
contents. But the narrow-headed larvee (which develop into winged adults) continue
_ for a much longer period to receive salivary diet. There is, however, no evidence

to indicate that the two types of larval forms arise as a direct response to the

nutrition they receive—the facts are indeed to the contrary. He concludes (p. 30)

that the development into soldiers and workers is consequent’on the less quantity of
saliva which they receive, and with this is associated the earlier appearance of
intestinal Protozoa, and their constant presence in great abundance. The Protozoa,

he implies, have a retarding effect on the development of the gonads. This thesis I

claim is unproved and, as is fully discussed on pp. 158 and 162, there is good reason to
believe that the Protozoa are mainly symbiotic in their relations to their host. It is

remarkable, therefore, that Grasst and Sanpias should suggest (p. 24), that it is
probable though not proved, that the Protozoa have an important digestive function,
