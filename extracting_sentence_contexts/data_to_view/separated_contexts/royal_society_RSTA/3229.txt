The second enclosure was alone used for higher pressures, it being, as we shall see, of
stronger construction. Apart from the effect of actual pressure, that of the sudden impact or blow given
by the more rapid explosives has to be considered. As will be seen below, some
mixtures of compressed coal gas and oxygen develop their full pressure in something
like one ten-thousandth of a second and, in fact, occasionally detonate. It is diffieult
to estimate the actual strain produced by a force so suddenly applied. *
