As
mentioned before, for such cases Za (M3; T) are basically false theta functions, which are known to
furnish (rather simple) examples of the so-called quantum modular forms, as will be explained
in §2. The quantum modular properties of the quantum invariants Z, are essentially what
makes their relation (1.4) to Zcs possible. At the same time, it can be shown that a mock theta
function and the corresponding false theta function lead to a pair of quantum modular forms
that are in fact basically equivalent (cf. lemma 2.6), in a way that precisely leads to the radial
limit relation (1.6). This leads to the natural guess that the quantum invariants Z.(—M3; t) for
the orientation-reversed three-star plumbed manifold are given by mock theta functions. This
conjecture, proposed in [10], will be discussed in conjecture 2.7.
