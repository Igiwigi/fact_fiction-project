TurNeER’s ‘Chemistry’ its
constitution is thus defined: 1, or one equivalent of hydrogen, + 8, or one equivalent
of oxygen, = 9 the equivalent of water; and, by volume, 100 of hydrogen combines
with 50 of oxygen to form 100 of steam. If we take 16 as the equivalent of oxygen,
which corresponds with its specific gravity, then HO, expresses distinctly the consti-
tution of steam both by weight and volume. Another objectionable point may some-
times be remarked though it has now almost disappeared, the combining ratio by
volume is inserted before any determination of the fact has been made: thus
