NUMERICAL EXAMPLES AND EXPLANATION OF FIGURES 6 TO 15

The formulae of ยง 6 have been applied to various spin- and fin-stabilized rockets rotated
by means of inclined nozzles. In order to present a full picture of the behaviour of such
a rocket during burning, detailed calculations of the angular deviation, yaw, etc., have
been made for a number of instants during burning, and curves have been drawn from the
figures obtained. These calculations have, for convenience, been based on a fictitious but
representative rocket whose characteristics have been chosen in order to make the numerical
work as simple as possible. The relevant parameters chosen for this rocket are:

Time of burning f= see. Launching velocity V, = 150ft./sec.
