larger more refracted part, decreasing in the same direction from the extremity of the
whole band towards its bright middle line. The stereoscopic effect produced by the
shading of the bands is represented by the diagram (Plate I.).

The configuration of all the bright orange and yellow bands is exactly the same; it
is rather obscured in the case of the preceding bands by the shadow spreading over
them, but becomes the same again in the bright red ones. Even in the dark bands 19
to 21, traces of the design are to be seen. The appearance of the green bands, though
the general character be the same, slightly differs; the shading in the middle part of
them being increased, they rather seem to be divided into two.

The accordance of these bands, eyen to the minute detail of their configuration, is a
fact worthy of attention.

entirely stereotype ; all apparent changes result from the different intensity of light.
The middle part of the spectrum, on the contrary, may much differ from that which we
have described ; you may even say that this part varies more or less essentially on
replacing one spectral tube enclosing nitrogen by any other. Sometimes the traces of
the less refracted bands are seen far beyond HP, spreading over the channeled part of
the spectrum ; in other cases the channeled appearance goes in the opposite direction
