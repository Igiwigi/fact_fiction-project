Linearized Grad-type moment equations have proper entropy inequality, and are stable [30].
One can say that the Grad method preserves enough of the properties of the Boltzmann equation
at least close to equilibrium. Even without a formal entropy inequality, the nonlinear Grad-type
equations are able to describe processes outside of the hydrodynamic regime sufficiently well.
However, the lack of structure—loss of 2nd law and hyperbolicity—might lead to breakdown of
solutions, or unphysical results for strong non-equilibria.

(d) Closure by entropy maximization

For the Grad closure, the distribution is a perturbation of the Maxwellian that assumes (very
small) negative values at large velocities, and hence the entropy (2.6) cannot be determined.
Maximization of entropy (MaxEnt) offers an alternative route to closure, that is in fact centred on
entropy, and produces a positive distribution function, and a proper form of the 2nd law [31,32].

The idea is to chose the least biased distribution that is compatible with the chosen variables,
which is obtained by maximizing the entropy (2.6) under the constraint of given values for the


variables F4. Taking care of the constraints by means of Lagrange multipliers A, this results in a
distribution that is the exponential of a polynomial in c,

fax = exp [- > Axoa| . (2.12)
