Such differences as exist are not regular and are due to accident. Consequently, there can have been no functional interference between the roots of
even the closest sown plants at the time when they differentiated their first flower-
buds. This fact is of primary importance in the analysis of yield. The greater
the number of plants on the area the greater will be the early yield, other things
being equal. With a crop which gives one almost simultaneous “yield,” such as
wheat, the root-interference effect should be very important.
