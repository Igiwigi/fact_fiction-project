reniform corpuscles before aggregated together in circular groups now gradually lose
their distinctness of outline, and imperfectly coalesce into confused ill-defined masses,
having an oily aspect, s0 that, if in this state one of these vermicules be crushed under
the microscope, amorphous oily and granular matter will be seen to have escaped from
it, similar to that contained in the ventral part of the adult animal. Here, too, the
restraint to the lateral growth of these entozoa being very much diminished, their breadth
increases rapidly, and they present globular projections extending out very irregularly
from their sides, giving them an irregular figure. See Plate XI. fig. 2. These projections
gradually take on the form of those which were described on the ventral part of the
perfect entozoon. The largest of the entozoa which I have seen in this stage is about
vz5th of an inch in length, and Z5th in breadth.

The next facts requiring especial notice, are those connected with that stage of develop-
ment which takes place after the animalcule has become surrounded byan adventitious cyst.

The first indication of the formation of such a cyst is, the turgescency of the capil-
laries, or some of the smaller vessels in the vicinity of one or more entozoa. Granular
bodies, exudation corpuscles, and fibres of different shapes next make their appearance.
These at first only partially obscure the entozoon, but afterwards completely conceal it.
When the cyst is first formed, the animalcule can, by a good light and careful exami-
nation, be obscurely seen within it, and by dissection under the microscope it can be dis-
lodged. See Plate XI. fig. 1, which is an accurate representation of one of these animals
folded up in its cyst. Thus folded up, it measures 4th of an inch in length.

Plate XI. fig. 7 shows a Cysticercus removed from its adventitious cyst. It has still
