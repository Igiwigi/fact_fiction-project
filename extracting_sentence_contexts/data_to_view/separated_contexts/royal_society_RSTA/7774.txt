Comparison of the behaviour of the two varieties of chloride in solutions containing
about 0-9 gm of dextrine per 100 ce gave the figures shown in Table V

For the nodular variety the adsorption was found in three different concentra-
tions :—

The increase with rising concentration is again very slow. At the higher temperature of 60° lead chloride differed from the azide in showing
no measurable adsorption. This observation is in accordance with the fact already

known that crystals of the chloride formed at higher temperatures take up very little
dextrine from the solution during growth. Advantage was taken of the tabular form of the second preparation to make a
direct estimation of area more precisely than had previously been possible. The
preparation consisted of flat oblong plates of varying lengths up to 1-3 mm, generally
with square ends.
