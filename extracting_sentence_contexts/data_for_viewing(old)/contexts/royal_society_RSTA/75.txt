Definition 2.1 (flock). We say that a solution (p, u) of (1.1) converges to a flock if the following
hold:

(i) Spatial diameter is uniformly bounded, i.e. there exists D < +00 such that
S(t) :=sup{|x — yl, x,y esupp(p(t))} <D, Vt>0.
(ii) Velocity diameter decays to 0 for large time, ie.

Jim ViQ=0, VO) =supllutx,t) — uly, |, xy €supp(o(O)}-

If V(t) decays exponentially fast in time, we say the flock has a fast alignment property.

Theorem 2.1 shows the flocking property for strong (Lipschitz) solutions of the non-local
alignment system (1.1). In fact, the following fast alignment holds for strong solutions of both
CS and MT models. This is quantified in terms of the following interaction bound, which will be
used throughout the paper:

<m CS model

d
\, a(x, y)p(y) dy {: 1. MT model.

Recalling that ¢(-) < 1, one may use the CS interaction bound m := Sign poly) dy, whereas m = 1 for
the MT model.

Theorem 2.2 (flock with fast alignment). Let (o,1) be a global strong solution of system (1.1)
