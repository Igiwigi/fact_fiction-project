the contrary, it can be included in the definition of standard (originally second-order) collision
models for them to benefit from the inclusion of higher-order velocity terms [5].

Consequently, collision models are not expected to have any impact on the macroscopic
behaviour of the resulting LBMs, as long as, (1) they are based on the very same equilibrium
state, (2) relaxation parameters satisfy the continuum limit required to perform the Chapmanâ€”
Enskog expansion. If one wants to improve the asymptotic behaviour of LBMs in an a priori
manner, one must adapt either the discrete equilibrium state or the velocity discretization.


This statement obviously extends to LBMs based on collision models with dynamic relaxation
frequencies (entropic [87-89], KBC [10], subgrid scale models [90], space filtering [66,91], etc.).
This is explained by the fact that they either lead to (1) a space- and time-dependent kinematic
viscosity v(x, t), or (2) a dynamic relaxation of third- and higher-order non-equilibrium moments
that should not have any impact on the isothermal macroscopic behaviour. It is finally worth
noting that one could rely on approaches based on velocity-dependent relaxation times [47], or
even correction terms [26,77,85,92-95], to alleviate the remaining deficiencies of standard velocity
discretizations.

(a) Motivation

In the previous section, the impact of the equilibrium on the macroscopic behaviour was
highlighted. Nevertheless, the latter behaviour is only one of the properties of the DVBE and its
