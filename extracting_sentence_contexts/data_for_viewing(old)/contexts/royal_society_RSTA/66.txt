the so-called central autonomic network (CAN). In summary, we show that, provided proper
conditioning is employed to eliminate spurious causalities, ultra-high-field functional imaging
coupled with physiological signal acquisition and GC analysis is able to quantify directed
brain-brain and brain-heart interactions reflecting central modulation of ANS outflow.

(a) Imaging the autonomic nervous system

The autonomic nervous system (ANS) owes its name to John Newport Langley [1], a British
physiologist widely regarded as the father of autonomic neurophysiology. As later communicated
by Langley himself, ‘it was a local autonomy that [he] had in mind. The word “Autonomic” does
suggest a much greater degree of independence from the central nervous system that in fact exists’
[2]. Hence, since its discovery and despite its nomenclature, the ANS has never been considered
or treated as completely independent from the central nervous system (CNS). More than a century
after its discovery and initial description, there is still substantial debate about the nature as well
as functioning of the control pathways through which the CNS interacts with the ANS.

While functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) based on the blood-oxygen-level
dependent (BOLD) effect [3] allows access to non-invasive, spatially and temporally resolved
functional information about brain activity at rest as well as during task execution, direct non-
invasive in vivo recordings of ANS activity are not accessible. In this context, the analysis of heart
rate variability (HRV) has emerged as a valid signal-processing approach to the estimation of ANS
outflow, which also allows us to partially disentangle sympathetic and parasympathetic activity.
In particular, band-specific spectral powers in the RR interval time series (i.e. the series of intervals
