In some Fishes the colour of the peritoneum has an effect on the external
appearance, because it is visible through the thin translucent body-walls. Even in
Pleuronectidee in certain species, and in certain stages of other species, the reflecting
opaque tissue of the peritoneum of the lower side is visible from the exterior when
there is little or no argenteum in the skin. But the fact is, that the peritoneum of
the upper side in normal Pleuronectidee is black, while that of the lower side contains
little or no pigment, but contains more argenteum or more guanin than that of the
upper. Now the peritoneum is of small extent compared with the whole of the lower
side, and it can scarcely be maintained that the appearance of its argenteum from the
exterior is of any use or advantage to the Fish, while the pigmentation of the peri-
toneum of the upper side adds nothing at all to the external appearance of the upper
rside. Fig. 8, Plate 55, shows the appearance of the peritoneum of the ovarian pouch
b of the upper side in the Pleuronectes microcephalus, a network of black chromato-
phores resting on a granular deposit of granules of guanin ; no “coloured” pigment
was present.
