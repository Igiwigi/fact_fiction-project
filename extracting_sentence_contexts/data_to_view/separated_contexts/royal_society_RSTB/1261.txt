By the arrest of the apex of the leaf,
titution of the lateral lobes, as implied in the hypothesis above put forward,
@ compact bud is produced, and the synangia are better protected. The arrest
pex of the leaf may, perhaps, be compared with a similar arrest in the flower
in Angiosperms, where mechanical inconvenience has led to abortion of
or carpels. Bthe ground of the above facts and considerations, I conclude that the
the Psilotacee (apart from branching in the ordinary sense of the word,
is much more common in Psilotum than in 7° mesipteris) is a simple shoot,
of an axis, bearing sporangiophores and foliage leaves. These alternate
another in irregular zones, and in 7’ mesipteris the transition from foliage
to sporangiophores may be frequently repeated, in Psilotwm the repetition is
i The condition is thus similar to that in Lycopodium Selago with
ive sterile and fertile zones. The abortive synangia correspond to the
sporangia in this and other species of Lycopodium, and accordingly the
al considerations as regards origin from a simple strobilus, which were laid
Lp. 535, for the genus Lycopodium, will apply with equal force to Psilotum
