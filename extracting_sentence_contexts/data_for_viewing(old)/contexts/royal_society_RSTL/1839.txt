tion, becomes the parent of exertion, which when thus called
forth, cannot be shown in a much greater degree by any of
the feathered tribe. The moor-hen (which winters with us)
gives another instance of what a bird, which appears 80 much
to want activity in its ordinary flights, is capable of perform-
ing when exertion is actually required. When pursued by a
hawk, and self preservation calls up all its powers, it may be
seen to rush up into the air with amazing velocity, almost as
high as the eye can reach, then darting down with an equal
pace, it often, by such rapid manceuyres, escapes the destruc-
tive talons of its swift pursuer. ;

It is a remarkable fact that the swallow tribe, and proba-
bly many other birds which absent themselves at stated
periods, should return annually to the same spot to build
their nests. The swift, which for nine months has some dis-
tant region to roam in, was selected for the purpose of an
experiment to ascertain this with precision, At a farm-house
in this neighbourhood I procured several swifts, and by tak-
ing off two claws from the foot of twelve, I fixed upon them
an indelible mark. , The year following their nesting places
were examined in an evening when they had retired to roost,
and there I found several of the marked birds. The second
and third year a similar search was made, and did not fail to
