borrowing events in human history, e.g. [11,50]. Data points in
SegBo come from reports, such as grammars and phonologi-
cal descriptions, that include detailed information on
segments that have been borrowed from one language to
another. Individual data points were coded for, inter alia, geo-
graphical area of the borrowing language, the source
language (when known), the distribution of the segment in
the borrowing language's lexicon, and whether the segment
introduces new phonological distinctions into the language.
Other metadata related to both borrowing and source
languages is available via Glottocodes [51]. Importantly,
most of the borrowing events documented in SegBo are
recent, and in fact most probably date to the past approxi-
mately 500 years, and many of the donor languages are
those that spread throughout the world through historical
processes of colonialism and globalization, such as English,
Spanish, Arabic, Russian and Indonesian [11].

Table 2 shows that PHOIBLE is much larger than the other
two databases. Figure 1 highlights the discrepancies in the
size and macro-area coverage of the three databases. It pro-
