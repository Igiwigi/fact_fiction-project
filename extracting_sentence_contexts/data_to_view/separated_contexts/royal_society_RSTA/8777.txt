As already explained in § 7, an exponential formula of type (21), which
was indicated by a mixed elastic-viscous theory, entirely failed to fit the facts. A
variety of possible laws connecting 8 and ¢ were tried, with greater or less success. The fact that initially 8 was finite, but S infinite suggested

S = §-bat’,
n being an exponent less than unity. Tt was found that » = 4 gave a fair fit for the whole range of the curve, a result which
confirms the observations of Dr. E.
