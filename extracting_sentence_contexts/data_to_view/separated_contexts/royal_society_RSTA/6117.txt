Thus, in cases where one believes in the existence of strong emergence that
resists ontological characterization in terms of physical or informational causal efficacy, such as
the emergence of qualia in the conscious mind [6,34], it becomes consistent to classify AOIE as a
type of weak emergence. Although not constraining the computational class of the observer may seen reasonable, one
is inherently assuming that there are ‘special’ observers that belong to a higher computational
class than that of all the other systems that can be observed by them, an assumption which per
se is just another type of constraint to be applied to the definition of AOIE. One way to avoid
this assumption, while still remaining consistent with the fact that AOIE is a stronger form of
emergence than is usually considered weak emergence (which generally falls under the ODE) is
to classify AOIE as a type of intermediate emergence [6]. This kind of terminology has been proposed
by Chalmers [6] to deal with a type of emergence that arises from a fundamental epistemological
limitation, given the known physical laws at the time of observation. In this sense, intermediate
emergence is predicated upon the unbridgeable incompleteness of the observer’s knowledge, so
that even ‘in principle’ one would not be able to deduce the macro-level complex behaviour,
which is still ‘in principle’ determined by irreducible new laws that one always needs to devise
or discover in the future, as also claimed in Cooper [53] where emergence is suggested to be a
consequence of uncomputability.
