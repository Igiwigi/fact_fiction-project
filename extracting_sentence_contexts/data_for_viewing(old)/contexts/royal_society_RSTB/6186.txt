from that of an intact animal.

Regarding the receptors concerned in dictating those comprehensive skeletal
adjustments, we may consequently draw the following conclusions. In themselves
the muscle receptors of the frog are entirely inadequate for the purpose. With the
added help of vision the frog may react against imminent danger of unbalance.
The most important gravity receptors, however, lie in the labyrinths.

Outstanding Features of the Labyrinthine Gravity Reactions

It would be tedious to attempt to describe in detail the different adjustments of
the frog, by forward, backward, sideward or diagonal body displacement to
simple gravity disturbanceâ€”especially as many of the facts have already been
recorded and illustrated by Tarr and McNay (1925). Instead, we shall deal with
the principles involved.

As already affirmed, the reactions are identical whether elicited by slow inclination
on the tilt-table, by centrifugal force or by application of linear acceleration at
right angles to terrestrial gravity. By each relevant movement of the animal two
notable effects are achieved. First, the plane of the head (ordinarily horizontal)
is brought to a position normal to the momentarily acting acceleration. Secondly,
the centre of gravity of the body is shifted, so that a line drawn through it in the
direction of the momentarily acting acceleration falls more securely within the base
of support. It is also noteworthy that the animal does not react in a smoothly
continuous way to progressively increasing change of the relation between the
