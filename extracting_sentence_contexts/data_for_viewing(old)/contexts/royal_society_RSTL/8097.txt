hind premolar, its disproportionately small and few (two) tubercular molars, and its

Slarge laniariform upcurved incisor, comes nearest to 7hylacoleo (figs. 8 & 14), it is plain,

SRat-kangaroos.

= What we do learn from consideration of the fossils in question is, the fact of an addi-
ional and most interesting modification of the Diprotodont section of the Marsupial

-2order or subclass, unknown before the discovery of these fossils. We further learn that
