We have
first to calculate the distribution of R, magnetic force, in both media due to the
pole m, as disturbed by the change of inductivity. We have div y,R, =m in the
first medium, and div ~,R, = 0 in the second, therefore R has divergence only on
the interface. Let o be the surface density of the fictitious interfacial matter to
correspond ; its force goes symmetrically both ways; the continuity of the normal
induction therefore gives, at distance 7 from A, the condition

The magnetic potential ©, such that R = — VQ is the polar force in either region, is
therefore the potential of m/p, at A and of o over the interface. But if we put matter n at the image B, of amount
