estimate being made of the wave-form in the resonator. This aspect of the subject
should, however, be dealt with experimentally by the oscillating valve method. We
are unable at the present moment to understand definitely the part played by the
formation of the discontinuity in preventing a greater proportion of energy to be
propagated to a distance as sound-waves. In its application to fog-signal waves, the
problem is greatly complicated by propagation in three dimensions, the divergence
tending to retard the tendency to the formation of a discontinuity with the resulting
dissipation of energy. â€˜The effect of confining the sound-wave to a conical trumpet
tends to enhance the formation of a discontinuity. The superiority of the short
trumpets employed in practice would seem to be due to the fact that conditions are
so adjusted that, while the advantage of resonance is obtained, discontinuity does not
form before the wave has emerged into the free atmosphere, when more rapid
divergence precludes the further possibility of discontinuity taking place. The fact
that in a siren the wave is carried forward by air moving with considerable velocity
would tend to retard the formation of the discontinuity and probably increase the

power delivered to the free atmosphere. All these questions are of great importance
in practice and constitute a practically unexplored field for future investigation.
Some light may be thrown on the formation of the discontinuity by considering
a harmonic plane wave propagated in a cylindrical tube having the cross-section
(90 cm.?) of the narrowest part of the conical resonator of the diaphone whose acoustic
output was measured by the thermodynamical method. It will be noticed from
