memory consolidation is observed during NREM stage 2, and periods of refractoriness are thought to be critical for efficient
but not stage 3, sleep. Hence, this suggests that spindles, reprocessing and offline consolidation of both declarative and
which iteratively occur locally within clustered and tem- non-declarative procedural memories, respectively, during
