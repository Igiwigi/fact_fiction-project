is very approximately the same. The curve rises somewhat at about 420 and falls
regularly to a very low value near 760 muy.

The cell used in the submarine photometer case was not examined by us, but it is
probable that its response did not differ markedly from its fellow, though small
variations are to be expected,

It had been our custom to operate all our vacuum cells at 60 volts anode potential,
since this is sufficiently close to their saturation voltage to give a voltage sensitivity
coefficient of 0-3-0-5 per cent. per volt. It was, therefore, rather a surprise to find
that these C.M.V. 6 cells were nearly saturated at 6 or 8 volts. They might certainly
be used with safety at 10 volts. The advantage lies in being able to use a smaller, and
far lighter, high-tension battery, where portability is important, and in the fact that
“dark” currents become of much less importance with such a low voltage. In this
work they were, however, operated at 60 volts, like photometer H, to avoid altering the
plug, since the use of the heater prevented any dark current.

The results for ultra-violet radiation, Series 76 and 81, were obtained by the use of a
Burt sodium vacuum cell of thin soda glass and a G.E.C. potassium vacuum cell
respectively. The cells were embedded in vaseline, as recommended by SHELFORD and
Gat, and covered with special filters, below which sea water was admitted. No opal
