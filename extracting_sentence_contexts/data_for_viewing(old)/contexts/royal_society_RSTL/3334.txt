cast and safely polished of s0 brittle and untractable a material ; and although some
of the difficulties have been surmounted, till it is probable, that in seeking to obtain
the utmost possible amount of telescopic power the state of our atmosphere admits
of, the requisite dimensions will not be attained by a simple casting of this alloy.
The idea, therefore, obyiously suggested itself of uniting several castings into one re-

flecting snrface, and as the best means of effecting that, to solder them upon an alloy
of zinc and copper, (in fact, upon a species of brass,) which should expand and
contract in the same proportion as speculum metal.

The experiment was tried repeatedly upon a small scale, and the difficulties which
presented themselves successively surmounted, till at length a speculum of three feet
aperture was completed, which bears distinctly a high power.

The evil most to be apprehended in this construction, was unequal contraction and
expansion in the different changes of atmospheric temperature ; that, however, seems
to have been sufficiently guarded against, as I have never succeeded in detecting the
slightest change of figure. It is therefore highly probable, that specula very much
larger may be constructed upon this plan, and that, in fact, by repeating a number
of operations, each on a scale perfectly manageable, we may obtain a reflecting surface
