tional to, but not identical with, the numbers which express its density. An attempt
has been made to remedy this imperfection, retaining the general features of our present
method, but the changes proposed have never been adopted, such alterations being always
attended with 8ome inconvenience, and the question at issue being one neither of theory
nor of fact *,

The following-pages contain the outline of a new method for the expression, by means
of symbols, of the exact facts of chemistry, and for reasoning upon these facts by their
aid. This method is quite independent of any atomic hypothesis as to the nature of the
material world, and in it the symbol is placed in immediate relation with the fact, being
indeed its symbolic equivalent or expression. It does not, however, preclude or deny
snch an hypothesis; the question is not raised. This method may be regarded as a
special application of the science of algebra, and in its construction T have been guided
by the similar applications of that science to geometry, to probabilities, and to logic, tq
which it presents many curious and interesting analogies.
