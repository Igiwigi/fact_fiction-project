concerns due to the high case fatality risk.

2. Awareness of Ebola

Before the 2013-2016 epidemic, public knowledge of Ebola was heavily influ-
enced by the descriptions in popular fiction and Hollywood blockbusters,
largely inspired by the media attention triggered by the 1995 Ebola outbreak
in Kikwit, DRC. These depictions generally portrayed a catastrophic, worst
case scenario, highlighting the potential apocalyptic qualities of Ebolaâ€”in
these fictional scenarios, not only could it spread virulently, destroying commu-
nities, regions and continents, but it also held significant potential as a
bioterrorism weapon. However, outside central Africa, Ebola was considered
more of a fascination than a genuine risk; although dangerous, it was limited
to central Africa and to the most rural and poorest regions. That view was
soon to change.
