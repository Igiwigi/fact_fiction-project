Although transformation optics provides the general path to the design of a medium
with exotic electromagnetic effects, the experimental implementation is a non-trivial challenge.
Fortunately, with the development of metamaterial technology, previously inaccessible electric
and magnetic material properties can be achieved by artificially structured building blocks
[74-76]. By tailoring the resonant or non-resonant electric and magnetic responses of these
subwavelength building blocks, which are typically arranged in a periodic fashion, negative
[77,78], near-zero [79-81] or high [82,83] permittivity and permeability values can be realized
along with a controllable degree of anisotropy [84,85]. The required inhomogeneous and/or
anisotropic material properties of the transformation optics designs can thus be realized using
specially designed metamaterials. However, because of the fact that the material parameters
of most of the above-mentioned transformation optics designs have extreme values, which
make their metamaterial realizations highly sensitive to frequency shifts and absorption losses,
the majority of these designs are either limited to mathematical constructions and numerical
validations or have only been experimentally demonstrated within a narrow frequency range.
Several efforts have been carried out in recent years to mitigate these shortcomings by sacrificing
certain types of functionality. One approach is to employ quasi-conformal mappings [18], which



eliminates the anisotropy and non-unity permeability of the transformed medium because the
magnetic response at optical wavelengths is very rare and weak even in optical metamaterials.
The drawback of such methods is that the transformed medium would suffer from increased
