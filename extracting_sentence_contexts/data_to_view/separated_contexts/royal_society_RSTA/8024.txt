For samples of 2, 1= 2, — a, if 2, > a, and x, —a, if a <<, and the
critical region oq will therefore lie between two straight lines parallel to and equidistant
from the axis z, =. A pair of such lines will be the envelope of the small squares w,,
Wg, ete., of fig. 8a. In fact, the complete critical region will be as shown in fig. 8B, the
belt woo being chosen so that its area is eb,?. Fic. 8. For n = 3 the surface | = J, is a prism of hexagonal cross-section, whose generating
lines are parallel to the axis z, = 7, =2,.
