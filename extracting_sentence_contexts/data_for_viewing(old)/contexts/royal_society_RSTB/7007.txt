Elsewhere the writer (Wardlaw 19436) has shown that during active growth of the
normal Dryopteris shoot lateral buds are not formed. Their development takes place either
during normal periods of quiescence in the apical meristem or when the meristem has
been removed, damaged, or temporarily affected by experimental treatment. Although
isolated terminal regions with as many as fourteen new leaves have been obtained, no
lateral buds have been observed in them. On the other hand, bud development in the
lateral segments has been extensive (ยง 5 (a)).

(b) Supply of nutrients to the apical meristem

It is perhaps not sufficiently realized that, as the apical meristem is the region of the
shoot most remote from the sources of nutrients, special problems of translocation are
involved in its maintenance. How, in fact, is the developing meristem maintained in an
actively growing condition? There is support for the view that the extent of development
of the leaf primordia is largely dependent on the nutritional status of the growing region
(Wardlaw 1945c), and this will ultimately depend on supplies proceeding from below.
Goebel (1900, 1908) considers that the primary leaves of the fern sporophyte are strictly
comparable in structure with the adult leaves but that their development has been arrested
in relation to limiting supplies of nutrients.

The supply of nutrients to the growing region though a problem of great importance
remains almost completely unexplored. In the subterminal region of a shoot of D. aristata
it can be seen (figures 2, 3) that although both cortex and pith are already well developed,
the vascular tissue is still in the initial phase of differentiation, i.e. phloem and xylem
cannot be distinguished (Wardlaw 19452). It is therefore relevant to inquire if this incipient
