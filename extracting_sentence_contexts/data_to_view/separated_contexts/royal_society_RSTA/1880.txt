Thus in an editorial for Chemical News in 1923, W.P. Wynne wrote:

We adhere to the original word celtium given to it by Urbain as a representative of the great
French nation which was loyal to us throughout the war. We do not accept the name which
was given it by the Danes who only pocketed the spoils of war. [73]

Neither Coster (Dutch) nor von Hevesy (Hungarian) was in fact Danish. Celtium continued to
appear in French textbooks during the interwar years, and the International Committee on Atomic
Weights was eventually asked to arbitrate on the matter. The Committee initially prevaricated by
suggesting that both names could be used.
