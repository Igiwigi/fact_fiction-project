$ My researches have not yet been extended to the Invertebrata; but I am by no means disposed to con-
sider the existence of the vesicle, which I have called the ovisac, as limited to vertebrated animals.

siderable this portion of the calyx may appear, yet for the sake of analogy the distinc-

The proper Membrane of the Yelk in Mammals.

49. Several distinguished authors have not described this membrane. And in
fact it is not easy to demonstrate the separate existence of such a membrane in the
class Mammalia generally, at those periods in the formation of the ovum when the
latter is usually examined. On the other hand, a very accurate observer, KRavsE,
has figured it in the Goath, and appears to have often seen it in other Mammals.
My friend Professor RupoLen WacxER pointed it out to me in the Cat; and he seems
convinced from analogy that its existence must be general in the class Mammalia,
bat does not appear to have discerned it in any other instance||. I have since met
with and figured it in early stages of the oyum of the same animal (the Cat), and I
believe also in the Hog (Plate V. figs. 17. and 16. e.; Plate VIII. fig. 70. e.). In later
stages, ante coitum, T have sought this membrane in yain as a distinct structure| ; but
I think it not improbable that the well-marked line generally regarded as representing
the internal surface of the thick chorion, may be partly due to the proper membrane
of the yelk, as is obviously the case in Plate V, fig. 17. e. and f.
