Now the Gravity of a Body which is the: Cayſe of its
finking or tendency downwards, is commenſurare to its
Bulk : but the Reſiſtance tharthe Liquor makes is pro»
portion'd , not to the Bulk, but to the extent of the
ſurface of the Body impmerled in it, Whence 'tis plain, ;
a Body may be ſo tar divided that its Parts may be fue by
fain'd in a Fluid, whole Specifick Gravity is leſs than that ©
of the faid Body. Nay, 'tis matter of Fact that they ©

thus ſupported in a Fluid : , So when they occur and unzte
again , they mult fiuk of Courſe, and fall to the |! Bottom, -
