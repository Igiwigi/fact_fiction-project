In these orders, severally, it is the same fluid, chemically
and physiologically. In all it occupies the peri-visceral or peritoneal chamber. These
indisputable facts establish conclusively the view which denominates the peritoneal
fluid of Asterias, even though it may look like pure water, as a vitally endowed fluid. In addition to the bodies above described, which are the proper corpuscles of the
chylaqueous fluid in Sipunculus Harveii and S. Johnstoni, others may be observed in
every specimen and at every season of the year, which severally resemble germ-cells
and sperm-cells*.

* I have designedly avoided in the text all discussion as to the real character of these ova- and spermato-

zoa-like bodies. which are constantly found in the chylaqueous fluid of nearly all zoophytic, radiate and STLOUIRISL
animals.
