the purpose of calculating the coefficients of linear expansion with the aid of the
angular deviations for the same temperatures. For the linear coefficients of expansion
d for 100° the following numbers were given :—

d, = 0:00437, ,=0°00385, dr, = 0°00479,

Tt was therefore concluded that “ the erystals of the three salts, on heating, expand
most in the direction of the vertical axis c, and least along the macrodiagonal axis b.”
We have seen that this is indeed the case, except for temperatures below 50° in the
case of \, and \, of the rubidium salt, a fact which the method could not possibly
have indicated, as at 60°, the temperature of the higher density determinations, the
rule found is really true.

The actual values now published for the total expansion of potassium sulphate,
taking this salt as an example, for the 100° between 20° and 120°, calculated by the

20 + 120)
formula « = a+ 2b ( —) are as follows :

a, = 0°003818, a, = 0°003422, a, = 0°004212.

The difference between these highly accurate values and the approximate ones
