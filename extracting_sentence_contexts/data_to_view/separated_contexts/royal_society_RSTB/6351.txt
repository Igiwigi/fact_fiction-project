In the same way, Lange’s nerve must be regarded


ON THE NERVOUS SYSTEM OF THE STARFISH 165

as a local centre serving for the innervation of the inferior transverse muscle. The
motor nervous system of Marthasterias glacialis, as far as it can be traced, is, in fact,
developed where it is most required, 7.e., in the neighbourhood of the muscles of the
arm and disk. Comparison of the motor systems should be made with this fact in
mind, and not merely by reference to the hyponeural and apical systems which,
from the evidence provided by the study of Marthasterias glacialis, are only parts of
a generally distributed neurofibrillar plexus. The hyponeural system is, on this account, best developed in the ophiuroid where
it undertakes the innervation of the four intervertebral muscles responsible for the
lateral and oro-aboral flexure of the arm. In the Holothuroidea it is precisely this
centre of innervation which supplies fibrillae to the circular and longitudinal
musculature of the body wall.
