the field. It follows directly from the discovery of CERSTED.

Theorem B.—If a conducting circuit embraces a number of lines of magnetic force,
and if, from any cause whatever, the number of these lines is diminished, an electromotive
force will act round the circuit, the total amount of which will be equal to the decre-
ment of the number of lines of magnetic force in unit of time.

The number of lines of magnetic force may be otherwise defined as the integral of the
magnetic intensity resolved perpendicular to a surface, multiplied by the element of
surface, and by the coefficient of magnetic induction, the integration being extended
over any surface bounded by the conducting circuit.

This theorem is due to FARADAY, as the discoverer both of the facts and of this mode
of expressing them, which I think the simplest and most comprehensive.
