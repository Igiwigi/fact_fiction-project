Hence —D,x + (I — D, K)y € D(Q), and
(A — Q)(—Dx + I — Dy Kg) = w-
Now let 4 € p(Q) MN p(Qx), so that 1 € p(D,K) and 1 € p(KD,), due to lemma 3.3. We have
—D,x + (I— KD, )¢ = RQ, Q)w. By applying (I — D,.K)~1 in both sides of the above equality, we obtain
~(— Di K)"1D,x + 9 = (1 — Di K)1R(, Qi = RA, Ox)
Using the fact that (I — D,K)~! =I + D,(I — KD,)K, it follows that
y = Dy(l — KD;)"1x + RQ, Qk) = Eax + RQ, Qk). G14)
According to (3.13), we have
(a —A—LE,)x=y + LR(A, Qk)W. Let us now assume that A € p(A + LE;).
