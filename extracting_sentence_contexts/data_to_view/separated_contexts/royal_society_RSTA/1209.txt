Moreover, the linear span of the generalized eigenfunctions of Ap is dense in Ly. As a by-product, we get that the spectrum of Ay is independent of p € (1, 00), but this follows
directly from the compactness of the resolvent. In [23, Section 4], it is also proved that all the
eigenvalues of AE have index 1 if and only if the matrix B is diagonalizable; 0 is a simple
eigenvalue and every eigenfunction is constant: in fact, if u € D(A) and A} u=0 then T(fu=u. On the other hand

lim T(t)u =| udy,
t>00 RN

and therefore u is constant. Let us come to the case p = 1.
