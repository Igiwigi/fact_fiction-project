Similar breccias have doubtless been formed in the country at various
times ; but the breccia at Taio-cho-shui may be part of the sheet which occurs five miles
to the N. around the village of Ta-pan-ching, where it underlies the red shales. If so,
both outcrops of limestone breccia are pre-Devonian and belong to the Kao-liang Series. The gorge of the Ta-pan-ching River presents a very instructive section, of which the
facts recorded in our note books during our hasty traverse of the gorge indicate the
following incomplete sequence. The rocks have been thrown into a series of folds and
have also been traversed by faults, and in one place by a small thrust-plane. The
predominant strike of the rocks is from 330° to 340°, so that the grain of this block of
hills, of which the western front here trends N. and §., is cut across obliquely by the
Salween valley ; heace the Salween valley, like that of the Shweli, is bounded on the
KE. by a dissected fault scarp.
