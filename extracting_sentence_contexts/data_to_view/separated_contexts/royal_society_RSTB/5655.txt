It is certainly
not ‘‘ cytoplasmic ” in the ordinary sense, since both sides of the crosses give the same
results ; nor can it reasonably be supposed to be environmental. Taking one thing
with another, there seem to be two interpretations available. (i) That high E-ness
and K-ness are the ends of a graded series and that all sinistrals have a tendency to
embryonic misdevelopment and the production of phenotypic dextrals, which varies
in different strains and is heritable: this does little more than re-state the facts. (i) That high H-ness is qualitatively different from the habit of « strains to produce
occasional dextrals, that it depends on a genetic factor, and that its manifestation
is masked when it is associated with K-ness. Our facts are very similar to those described by Wrigut and Eaton (1923) for
otocephaly in in-bred strains of guinea-pigs.
