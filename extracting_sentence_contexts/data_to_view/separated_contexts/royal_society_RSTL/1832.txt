Q. 5. Terrestrial Magneto-electric Induction.

140. WHEN the general facts described in the former paper were discovered,
and the law of magneto-electric induction relative to direction was ascertained
(114.), it was not diflicult to perceive that the earth would produce the same
effect as a magnet, and to an extent that would, perhaps, render it available in
the construction of new electrical machines. The following are some of the
results obtained in pursuance of this view.

141. The hollow helix already described (6.) was connected with the galya-
nometer by wires eight feet long; and the soft iron cylinder (34.), after being
heated red hot, and slowly cooled, to remove all traces of magnetism, was
put into the helix 80 as to project equally at both ends, and fixed there.
