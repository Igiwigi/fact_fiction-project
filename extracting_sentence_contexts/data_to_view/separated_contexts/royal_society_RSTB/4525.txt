Living within the lumen of the posterior intestine of Archotermopsis is to be found
an abundant Protozoan fauna. It occurs principally in the older larva, soldiers,
nymphs, and worker-like individuals, less abundantly in the younger larvee, and only
occasionally and scantily in the winged reproductive forms. Whenever the Protozoa
are present, evidence thereof can be detected by the fact that the contents ef this
portion of the digestive system appears brown to the unaided eye. The large
intestine is greatly enlarged and distended (Plate 10, fig. 62), in order to harbour the
truly enormous fauna which it contains. It is noteworthy that no special sac-like
outgrowth of the gut is present for the reception of these organisms, such as is found
among certain other Termitidee.
