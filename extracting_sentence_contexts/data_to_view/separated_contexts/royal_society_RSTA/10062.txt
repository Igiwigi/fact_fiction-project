The values of D calculated from these expressions, together with the differences
from the observed values, are set out in the last columns of the above tables. The
maximum difference in the case of KCl is 0°01, and in the case of NaCl, 0°02, and
these are the same as the duplicate experimental differences. It thus appears that the freezing-point depression, both for electrolytes such as
KCl and NaCl, and for non-electrolytes such as sugar in dilute solution, may be
expressed by one formula, viz. :—

A
———, = 1:86+CS1,,
N(i+a) s
since in the case of a non-electrolyte like sugar the ionisation is nil, so that « = 0,

and the molecular volume is nearly constant in dilute solution,* so that 61, = 0.

* We are justified in saying that the molecular volume of sugar is nearly constant in dilute solution
owing to the facts :—
(a) That the solution volume of sugar in dilute solution is nearly constant.
(+) That the viscosity of dilute sugar solutions is almost a linear function of the concentration. VOL. CCVI,—A.
