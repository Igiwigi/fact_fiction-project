Probabilities in A are
unchanged (as A is untouched) so p; and p, must have been swapped. To prove equiprobability,

we now swap records in A:
a
14) IAp) +14) Ay) â€”> I IAyI +1 1144). (4.5b)

Swap in A restores pre-swap | tay + |J)|A,) without touching S, so (by fact 3) the local
state of S is also restored (even though, by fact 1, it could not have been affected by the swap
of equation (4.5b)). Hence (by fact 2), all predictions about S, including probabilities, must be the
same! The probabilities of | +) and | |) (as well as of |Ay) and |A,)) are exchanged yet unchanged. Therefore, they must be equal.
