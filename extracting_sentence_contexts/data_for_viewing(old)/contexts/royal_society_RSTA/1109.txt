respectively. This equation is a particular case of equation (2.1), with 1(t) corresponding to
the respiration dynamics. Since the latter is a rhythmical process with a well-defined phase
w, we write the corresponding coupling function as a function of two phases, Q1(y,1(t)) =

Q(¢, W), while the contribution of other, unobserved, perturbations and of intrinsic fluctuations : s
is combined in the rest term € = >. Qx(g, nk(t)) + ¢(#). Practically, Q(y, ~) as a function of two : S
variables was constructed on a 64 x 64 equidistant grid in a domain (0,2z) x (0,27). [fF

Note that determination of the respiratory phase y is simple: since the respiratory signal looks : a
like a modulated and slightly distorted sine-wave, its phase can be easily estimated, e.g. by means : =
of the Hilbert transform. On the contrary, the ECG signal has a quite complicated form and : =
computations of its phase represent a non-trivial stand-alone problem, see [15]: here one needs 1B
very high-quality data, and its processing is technically quite demanding. This fact motivates : =
a development of techniques operating only with point processes, namely with instants of the 8
R-peaks, corresponding to the peak of depolarization of the ventricles of the human heart. These if
events can be easily detected and therefore are commonly used in the analysis of HRV. Since these : |
peaks appear once per heartbeat cycle, their continuous phase ¢ without loss of generality can be : §
set to zero. a

First, we discuss how the disentanglement of the HRV can be performed if both continuous 18

phases g(t) and w(t) are available [15]. For this goal, we note that, for a given time series g(t) and
w(t), the coupling function in equation (3.1) can be also interpreted as a time series Q[¢(t), W(t)] =
Q(t). Correspondingly, knowledge of time series g(t) and Q(t) yields the rest term &(t) = — Q.
Having all these time series, we easily construct the new disentangled ones. These are the
