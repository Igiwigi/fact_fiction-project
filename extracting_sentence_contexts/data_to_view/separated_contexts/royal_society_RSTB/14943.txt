Cell suspensions were then filtered (h) PADI2B overexpression and silencing
with a 30 mm filter (Partec). For OPC removal from OL lineage
cells from juvenile and adult brains, CD140a (anti-mouse
CD140 APC conjugated, BD Bioscience) labelling was performed. GFP-+ cells from postnatal brains and GFP+/CD140a- cells from
juvenile and adult brains were isolated with fluorescence-
activated cell sorting (FACS) using a BD FACSAria III Cell
Sorter B5/R3/V3 system. Sorted cells were collected in Eppen-
dorf tubes, centrifuged at 400g, resuspended in Qiazol and
stored at —80°C until RNA extraction/cDNA synthesis. PADI2£ and control overexpression cell lines were generated by
insertion of the following vectors with piggyBac transposon
system: pB-CAG-Ctr, pB-CAG-PADI28 for the control and overex-
pression of PADI2{, respectively; the gateway system was used to
clone these vectors in the final piggyback plasmids (Gateway LR
Clonase II Enzyme mix, Invitrogen/ThermosFisher Scientific,
11791020). pB-CAG-Ctr, pB-CAG-PADI26 were transfected
together with piggyBac transposase (pBase) expression vector by
lipofection according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Lipofec-
tamine 2000, Invitrogen 11668019).
