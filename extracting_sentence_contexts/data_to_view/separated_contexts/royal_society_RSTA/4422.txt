Hence,
as a second, equally unexpected and for ourselves surprising result, the data indicate in a very
strong way that the deviation is exactly the one that would theoretically be found if the situation
is modelled quantum mechanically by our Fock space model. Following the above-mentioned results, we believe that our findings strongly support the
validity of our quantum-theoretic framework in two-sector Fock space, which we summarize in
§4, and also our explanatory hypothesis that human reasoning is the superposition of a dominant
emergent dynamics and a secondary logical dynamics [31]. In fact, they indicate that the human
mind generally combines the concepts A and the negation B’ of the concept B by forming a new
concept ‘A and B’’, which emerges as an independent conceptual entity. But, superposed on this
mechanism, a second dynamics acts, where the new concept ‘A and B” is recognized as a logical
combination of A and B’. Our two-sector Fock space is a mathematical framework for representing
faithfully these processes, as we conclude in §6.
