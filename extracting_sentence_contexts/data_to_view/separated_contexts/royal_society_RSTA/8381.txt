H, L denote high and low water respectively. From fig. 9 we see that to the north of the Flemish Bight we shall have y = 180°,
and if we superpose this on the tides of fig. 8 we shall obtain a value of y lying between
180° and 270°. As a matter of fact, owing to the stronger currents across the southern
section, the value of y in the mouth of the Flemish Bight is only a little greater than 180°,
and the superposition gives the set of co-tidal lines of fig. 11. This is a very good
approximation to that given in fig. 17. Fig. 11—Co-tidal lines.
