where N is the number of water molecules inside the axial or radial bin and f is the number of MD
time steps over which the system is sampled. When the water density p is small, the statistics of
Qand B will be unreliable, so only measurements for p > 100 kg m~° are considered here. We will
show that these order tensors provide information beyond a standard dipole moment calculation,
the information for which is in fact contained within one of the eigenvalue/eigenvector pairs of
the tensor B. The measured values of Q and B are interpreted through an investigation of their eigenvalues
and eigenvectors. The tensors are symmetric and traceless so that two of the total three
eigenvalues are independent, and the set of eigenvectors forms an orthogonal triad, for each


tensor.
