As in the previous case, we measured the
quantity Ah decreasing the parameter y, and found a continuous increase in the height of the
undulation, as reported in figure 10a. We highlight that the normalized thickness Al/A strongly
depends on the parameter aj, as we can see from figure 10b. In fact, for thin soft layers the undulation decreases its width while decreasing y beyond its
critical value, thus forming a digitation. Conversely, the undulation width increases for thick top
layers, thus forming a stable wrinkle. In summary, AI/d increases if the top layer is sufficiently
thin, while it decreases if the top layer is above a critical thickness.
