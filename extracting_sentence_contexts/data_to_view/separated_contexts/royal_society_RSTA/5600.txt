Clearly, such artificial viscosity misses much of the structure of the actual viscosity in (3.25). For instance it misses the estimate (3.5). In fact smooth solutions of (3.25) satisfy the stronger
identity

that ¢= aoe 3 is the typical length of the latest correction, vy would have to be Kolmogorov’s

As remarked in [75], if uq converges strongly in L? to some u, then the latter would be a weak
solution of incompressible Euler which satisfies the local energy inequality

3This is in fact not fully correct since the proof of theorem 3.5 does not achieve the threshold } but rather gets ¢ close to it for
every positive e. This suggests a stronger form of the Onsager conjecture, where the dissipative solution is required
to satisfy (3.27). The first such examples in the literature were given in [22], but the solutions in
[22] were only bounded.
