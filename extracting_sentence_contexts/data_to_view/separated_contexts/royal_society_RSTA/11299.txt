As we have seen in {§ 22 and 23, the difference in tempera-
‘ture would tend to relatively depress the readings in the earlier experiments. Again,
‘awhile the entries in the last line of the table are persistently negative between 29
Sand 18 inches, they show no tendency to increase numerically as pressure falls. In
-ganeroid No. 4, as might be conjectured from Table XIX., the scale was not very
regular near 30 inches, so that the apparent index error, answering nominally to
30 inches, but in reality to a pressure which might be slightly greater, or slightly
Sless, was exposed to a fictitious variation, liable to influence the corrected errors at
Hower points of the range.

g § 28. To throw more ce on the general question, I calculated the mean corrected
errors shown by aneroids Nos. 2 and 3 in the years 1895, 1896, and 1897 separately,
3 confining my attention to the part of the scale most used, and including only those
experiments in which pressure was lowered at the normal rate. Particulars are
E given in Table XXVI.
