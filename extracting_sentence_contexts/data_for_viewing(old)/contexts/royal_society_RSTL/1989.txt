tricity in the same direction, neutralized the effect of one wire having half the
length, and conducting electricity in the opposite direction. From this he
concluded that the conducting powers were directly as the area of the con-
ducting section, and inyersely as the length. It is s0mewhat remarkable that
the fallacy of this conelusion has never been observed, or at least pointed out.

He might as well have concluded that the conducting power was directly as
the square root of the area of the section, and inversely as the square root of
the length, or, in short, as the nth root of the area of the section, and inversely
as the nth root of the length. The fact is, M. BecquerEL has deduced the
values of two unknown quantities from one equation.

Having shown that the laws of conduction, which we have examined, have
been deduced either by false processes of reasoning or by employing galvano-
meters founded on false principles, these laws must be equally fallacious.

Let us examine the law, if any such exists, which connects the: conduct-
ing powers of wires with the lengths when the diameters are the same. If
two wires of the'same diameter, but of unequal lengths, (for example, the one
being four times the length of the other,) be connected with a single pair of
zine and copper plates of the same size, and immersed in diluted acid of the
same $trength, the short wire may be found by my torsion galvanometer to
