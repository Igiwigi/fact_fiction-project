However, in order for decadal variability in LSW formation to
be reflected downstream, it must be exported in a relatively direct manner. If LSW experiences
significant mixing or a wide range of pathway lengths into boundary currents, it is conceivable
that decadal signatures could be mixed away before LSW is exported from the subpolar North
Atlantic. However decade-long observations in the Labrador Sea suggest that decadal signatures
are in fact exported in the DWBC. For example, Palter et al. [37] examined quasi-Lagrangian
float observations in the Labrador Seaâ€™s boundary current and found the thickest layers of LSW
exiting the DWBC in the late 1990s when the thickest layers of LSW were formed by intense deep
convection in the central Labrador Sea [37]. Into the early 2000s, as LSW formation slowed, the
thickness of LSW exiting the DWBC decreased.
