sample volume, this represents a plastic strain rate. To go further and estimate the incremental
strain induced by the avalanche, an additional hypothesis on the evolution of v during the
avalanche is required. Richeton et al. [33] assumed an exponential decay, v(t) = vpexp(—a(t — to)),
as the result, e.g. of phonon drag [58], where a is a damping coefficient. Considering a short
rise time, i.e. Aj © Amax (figure 2c), and integrating this evolution over time, one obtains an AE
source model that directly relates the maximum amplitude Amax to the total surface swept out
by the dislocations during the avalanche, and so, when normalized by the sample volume V,
to an incremental plastic strain €p, Amax ~ S/V ~ ep. This exponential decay assumption was
supported by a good correlation between the AE activity (defined as Amax cumulated over the
AE events population) and the global strain during creep tests on ice single crystals [55], as well
as by a T ~ In(Amax) scaling [33]. However, the last relation might also result from the scattering
of acoustic waves throughout the material and their reflection at the sample surfaces, generating
an exponentially decaying coda (e.g. [59]). This stresses the fact that (i) the interpretation of the
AE event duration T as the genuine dislocation avalanche duration and (ii) the proportionality
between Amax and the incremental strain Ep, have to be taken with caution. Whatever it may be,
Amax remains a useful proxy of the ‘size’ of the dislocation avalanche.

However, in other systems exhibiting intermittent slip avalanches, such as sheared granular
media [60] or faults [61], the radiated acoustic/seismic energy E is considered as being
proportional to the dissipated energy at the source, hence to well characterize the corresponding
avalanche. In order to allow a better comparison with those systems, we will focus here mainly
on AE energies instead of amplitudes. As E ~ A?,,, [62], these two descriptions of the avalanches
(either from E or Amax) are equivalent. Note that this E ~ A2,,, scaling is compatible with the
exponential decay hypothesis mentioned above, but with other assumptions as well, such as a
constant velocity v during the avalanche.
