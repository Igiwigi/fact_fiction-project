It was frequently observed that the house contains a little detritus passively displaced
by the movements of the animal (see figure 14), but there was never any indication
of spore formation. The observations recorded here also accord with Steinâ€™s figures of fission in Bicoeca
lacustris, although the apparent loss of the anterior part of the house which he figures
in one case was not observed. -

Both Senn (1900) and Lemmermann (1914) question the occurrence of transverse
fission, and it is conceivable that division is in fact longitudinal (parallel to the
antero-posterior axis), rotation in the house giving the appearance of transverse
fission. 4, THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FORMS @ AND / In the light of the observations on the forms a and } recorded here, it is suggested
that James-Clark originally confused two species; the one, B. lacustris, corresponding
to type a, the other corresponding to type b.
