That may often be true in
psychology and human decision making, but is never the case in quantum physics, beginning,
again, with the fact that quantum objects do not possess information. No information carried
from an earlier position measurement (answering the question about the position of the object)
has any relevance for any subsequent momentum measurement (asking the question about the
momentum of the object). This fact renders this earlier information meaningless as concerns
future predictions. Each quantum measurement is unique, and non-commutativity of QM reflects
this uniqueness, including in the case of two reversed complementary measurements, which
give us different outcomes, in contrast to classical physics. There these outcomes are the same,
because, neglecting, as one can, the interference of observational instruments, both variables
can be determined jointly at any moment in time.
