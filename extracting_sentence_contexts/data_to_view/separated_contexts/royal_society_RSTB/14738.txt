Some of
* ase Pr, the arrows in the circuit diagrams had to be inked out and
reversed. Those are just matters of definition. What is not just
a matter of definition is the fact that your results made it easy
‘ to formulate equations for the sodium channel closing (inacti-
— vation) gate (i). You used the action potential upstroke

velocity to estimate the magnitude of the sodium current
when depolarizing from various potentials. Given the impossi-
bility at that time of a voltage clamp technique, that was an
ingenious way to get the inactivation curve.
