abandoned in favour of the true explanation.+
The arrangement of the cells, two or three of which are often placed ir
above one another (see fig. 44) is quite inconsistent with the former view, ยฅ
negatived by the fact that no such transverse markings are seen in a tangentis
It is important to notice that the radial cells in question do not, as a}
continuous radial series, and thus differ from the true medullary rays, ยง
present in Sphenophyllum insigne. (Compare Plate 83, fig. 44, with Plate 8:
It must, however, be pointed out that the absence of continuous medulla:
not constant even in S. plurifoliatum. In the outer layers of the second,
continuous radial tracts of parenchyma, sometimes several cells in breadth, mak
appearance. (See Plate 75, photograph 22.)
The description given so far applies more especially to that part of the seo
wood which is formed between the angles of the primary xylem; we may term
of the wood interfuscicular, using this term for the tissue formed betweert
protoxylem-groups, in contradistinction to that which is formed opposite t
the latter the term fascicular wood will be used. 4
