film by transmitted light. Both are on quartz glass.

In order to decide whether the formation of lines was due to chance surface
irregularities, to some property of the metal film, or to a permanent property of the
surface, the film showing the easily distinguished quadrilateral pattern of fig. 41,
Plate 18 (silver on quartz glass), was removed with nitric acid, and the disc washed
with soap and water, rinsed and dried. Another silver film of the same thickness
as the first was then deposited, and subsequently heated as before. The characteristic
pattern was again obtained at the same spot as before, as shown in fig. 42. The
film was again removed with acid, and this time the disc was drastically cleaned by
the method of Harpy and Doustepay (loc. cit. in 1) and afterwards heated in vacuo
for 4 hours at 550° C, which should remove any water vapour. With subsequent
sputtering and heating the pattern was once more repeated. The fact that drastic
cleansing leaves a pattern of lines unaltered was observed at many different parts of
the surface, with all three silver films, and was as definite in most, if not all, cases
as in the one instance shown in the photographs. The feature of quartz glass
surface which gives rise to the lines is therefore so permanent that the most thorough
cleansing cannot remove it.

The surface of the disc was then mechanically polished by Messrs. Adam Hilger,
who estimated that the thickness of the abraded layer was about 10-® em. When
the process of sputtering and heating was repeated the characteristic pattern could no
longer be found.

The first obvious suggestion is that the lines are due to scratches on the surface,
