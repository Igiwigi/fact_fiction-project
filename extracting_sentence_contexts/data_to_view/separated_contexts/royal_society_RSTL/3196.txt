In the other instance the single Sper-
matozoon found was dead, and the ova had escaped. Now whether the Spermatozoa
are essential to the impregnating power of the seminal fluid, I do not think it needful
to inquire. The fact that in the course of these researches they have been met with on
the ovary, demonstrates that the seminal fluid sometimes penetrates as far as to the
surface of that organ. Whether it penetrates into its interior I am unable to deter-
mine; but certainly the changes above described, as taking place post coitum, in the
condition of the oyum while still within the ovary, are too remarkable not to favour
the s8upposition that it does}.
