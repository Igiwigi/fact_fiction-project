Based on previous studies, it is known that the triplet exciton in DOO-PPV is at Ep ~ 1.45 eV : 8
[22]. We therefore expect that the onset of the second process in the EXPA(w) spectrum would be Dos
at E ~2Er. This is in fact quite close to the experimental data that show an energy threshold at : =
2.8 eV, whereas 2Ey = 2.9 eV. As the HE-SF process here is interchain in nature, we suggest that Sy
the hot-exciton singlet exciton first converts into a TT pair state on two different polymer chains, 2
followed by separation into two triplet excitons on the two chains at a later time, similar to the aed
case of SF in acene crystals. When the polymer chains are isolated, however, as in the DOO-PPV 22
dilute solution, the interchain SF is not possible and therefore the EXPA(w) spectrum in this case : Ss
does not show the second step.
