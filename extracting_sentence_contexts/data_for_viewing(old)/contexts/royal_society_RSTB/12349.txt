We explored the impact of including 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%
and 100% of the modelled climatic refugia in the reserve net-
works. To ensure that the refugia were distributed as equally
across the country as possible, we required representation at
each percentage within each level-2 ecoregion [42]—a total of
12 of 21 ecoregions contained refugia. Likewise, we explored
the effects of including 20%, 40%, 60%, 80% and 100% of the
total length of all identified corridors in the reserve networks.
Again, we required representation at each of these levels within
each ecoregion. Because the corridors were more widely spread
than the refugia, this involved protecting corridors in 21 ecore-
gions. To account for the fact that corridors often spanned
more than one site, we forced the reserve-selection algorithm to
prioritize sites that shared a common corridor.

All site selection was done with the conservation planning
software Marxan [43]. MarxaNn uses simulated annealing to
find sets of sites that protect the conservation elements—species,
refugia, corridors, in the present study—while minimizing the
total cost of the reserve network. For each type of reserve net-
work, we completed 100 Marxan runs with 750 million
iterations each. To capture continuous sections of corridors, we
used the boundary length modifier in Marxan. The boundary
length modifier allows the user to adjust the cost of shared
