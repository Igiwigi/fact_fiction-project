Ficure 3. Astley Green: surveys of underground passage.

Three methods of estimating the disturbance of the field at the site have been considered.
The effect of a concentration of iron of moment M at a distance / from the mid-point of a
passage of length d was considered. If the vertical component changes linearly by an
amount dZ over the length of the passage, the disturbance ¢ at the mid-point of the passage
is less than 6Z if /> 3d. A roadway supported by arches can be taken as equivalent to a line
of vertical dipoles of moment m per unit length. Ifit is perpendicular to the base passage and
at a distance / from its mid-point, then ¢<0dZ if J+ 2d. Similar results can be found for other
configurations and for the H component. However, these criteria cannot be applied when
a line source is parallel to the base passage, and their practical use is limited by the fact that
the small local variations in the field may make it difficult to determine dZ. Attempts to
find the average value of the gradient by statistical fitting have been made, but the errors
are large and the validity of the method is doubtful as it assumes random disturbance, where-
as the disturbing iron is usually buried in the floor or pack wall and its effect is chiefly in
one direction. The base passage at Cadeby is narrow and has solid walls, so that any buried
