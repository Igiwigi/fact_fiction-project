The dependency of the spectral density of the output signal of system (3.1) at the frequency 2 for large t on the
noise intensity D for y = 0.1, A = 0.9,A = 0.1, 2 =1,x(0) = 0.5 and x(0) = 0.1. (Online version in colour.)

To determine the mean values (moments) (x), (x2), etc., we use the following relations:

Multiplying (3.3) by x (or p), and integrating with respect to x and p, we get the following
equations for the first moments:

Due to the fact that the considered system is linear, equations for the moments of order n are not
affected by higher order moments. As is seen from (3.5), the first-order moments are not affected
by noise. Equations for the second moments can be written in the matrix form X = AX +B with

This system is linear and its eigenvalues x are governed by the equation det(A — x1) =0 that takes

The solution to (3.6) will be stable if all eigenvalues are distinct and have non-positive real parts
