Thus in Thalia dealbata the readings increased from 5 at the base, through 12 in
the middle up to 18 at the tip. In Agapanthus umbellatus four regions of the leaf from the base
upwards gave 0, 2, 7, 10. These facts, as already stated, are of importance in relation toâ€™ the use of
the instrument, and show clearly the necessity of making no comparisons except between corresponding
parts of leaves. The same thing is true with regard to leaves of different ages, the hygroscope
readings on the stomatal side of young leaves are often considerably lower than on full-grown leaves.
