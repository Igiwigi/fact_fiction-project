field be about 400 X 1°6 centim. per second, if we take RutHERFoRD’s value of the
velocity for a potential gradient of 1 volt per centimetre. The 8 millims. would there-
fore be traversed in °8/(400 X 1°6) = 1/800 of a second. (The time would really be
somewhat longer on account of the plates being too small to give a sufficiently
uniform field.) Now the average length of life of the ions due to Réntgen rays when
they are destroyed by recombination alone is of the order of 1 second.* The fewer
the ions also the less rapid is the rate at which they recombine ; we would, therefore,
expect the average life of the very few nuclei with which we are now concerned, if
they really are ions, to be at least as long as 1 second in the absence of any electric
field. If then we have here simply a case of spontaneous ionisation due to molecular
encounters, we ought to obtain something like 800 times as many drops without the
field as with it. In similar experiments t made with the ions produced by Réntgen
or uranium rays, much weaker fields were in fact found sufficient to prevent almost
completely the production of fogs by expansion.

In the experiments now made without external ionising agents, not the slightest
difference could be detected between the appearance of the showers on the two sides
of the apparatus. All degrees of expansion from ¢,/v, = 1°25 to v,/v, = 1°38 were
tried.

If then we have here to do with a case of ionisation, it differs completely from the
ionisation produced by Réntgen rays.

Very similar nuclei, requiring practically the same supersaturation to make water
condense on them as the ions, are produced by the action on moist air of sunlight and
