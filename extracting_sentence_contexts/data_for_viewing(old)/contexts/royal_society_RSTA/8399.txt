* Note.—It may happen that the Nth calibration does not directly involve either one or both of the points
O and z. In that case the meaning of ny is to be understood to imply the value of O/n in terms of O/a
resulting from the Nth calibration, when this calibration has been laid down in an arbitrary position (ulti-
mately to be the best position) in relation to the original datum points for 0 and x, against which the whole
system of graphs is plotted.

These equations express the fact that the provisional value nx for the point » in this
calibration has theoretically been brought into coincidence with the unknown ideal
value , by the vertical movement Ax and the tilt By of the whole of the graph to which
the value ny belongs.

In these equations as applied to one calibration only there are py +2 unknowns,
namely 09, 1), 29---%-++(px Of these) and the two quantities A, and By. Thus
there are two more unknowns than equations. This is in accordance with the fact that
the graph possesses two degrees of freedom whilst still expressing the same relative
positions of the points.

The introduction of the equations resulting from another calibration, however (say
the Mth), in general only adds few or no unknowns of the type 2, i plus the two
