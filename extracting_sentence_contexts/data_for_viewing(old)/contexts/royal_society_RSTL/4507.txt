AT THE MOMENT OF CHEMICAL CHANGE. 761

view it is necessary to suppose that the present elemental atoms are susceptible of
a yet further division®,

'These ideas, however philosophical and suggestive, are yet, it must be allowed, very
hypothetical. The proof of the compound nature of a chemical substance is of a very
simple kind. It lies in the fact, that it has been made by the composition of certain
parts, or broken up into those parts, or at least in some phenomena which are sup-
posed to be the evidence of this. Indeed the rational formula of a chemical snb-
stance is but a memorandum of its reactions, and a particular mode of expressing
the law of the synthesis and analysis of the body, apart from which it has but little
meaning. The true nature therefore and chemical formula of the elemental bodies,
as of all other substances, is to be discovered by the study of the series of che-
mical changes in which they are formed, and by the phenomena which they pre-
sent when they pass into the combined condition. There are even well-known facts
of great importance in this point of view, some unexplained, and some, I conceive,
misinterpreted,

The point which I shall seek to establish is this,—that at the moment of chemical
