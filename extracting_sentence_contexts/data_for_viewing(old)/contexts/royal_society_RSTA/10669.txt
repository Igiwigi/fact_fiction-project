(15), (16), (17), and (18) are precisely of the same form as the stress-strain relations
and the body equations of equilibrium for two-dimensional elastic strain, with the
exception that ’ is written for 4. They will in fact be found to be identical with
the equations satisfied by the displacements of an elastic plate under thrust in its
own plane, as obviously they should be, since, when the beam is made indefinitely
thin, the mean displacements U, V coincide with the actual displacements u, v.
