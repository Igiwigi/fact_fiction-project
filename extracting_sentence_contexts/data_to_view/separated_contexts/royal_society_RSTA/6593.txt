Proof. The result is true when k = 1 by the definition of a boundedly reducible star body. The general result follows by induction just as in the proof of lemma 1; in fact, the proof may
be used word for word if A is replaced by 1. Lema 3. Suppose that K is a fully automorphic and fully reducible star body, and let k be a positive
integer.
