E low. Surface reaction at the hot exhaust valves is a possible source of this “ peroxide,”

G but other reactants influence its formation and it is not purely a matter of the
catalysis of the N, + O, = 2NO reaction at the surface of the valve. If the NO,
is formed in the flame, and comes from regions already burnt and mixed up by
turbulence, then it is not easy to explain the fact that some fuels behave so differently
from others. Furthermore, if the NO, is formed in the small flamelets seen through
