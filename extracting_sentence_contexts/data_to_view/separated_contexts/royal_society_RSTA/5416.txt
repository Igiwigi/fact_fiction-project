The second thing to notice is that the E of equation (29) is not what is usually
known as the electromotive force. The physical fact that is usually stated by saying
that E = RK, must with the present notation be stated by saying that E = 0, since
— RK appears on the right of equation (29) as a part of the term — ,Vx. This, of
course, is due to the fact that E of equation (29) is physically defined as the part of
the electromotive force not depending on friction,

D. Change of Variables in 1, d, and «x.

51. In what follows with reference to change of variables, we shall always speak as
if the change had reference only to /. Exactly similar reasoning applies to similar
changes of variables in any other function such as }, a, or a part only of any one of
these.
