No. 6, that there may have been an expansion
of the ductus endolymphaticus between the cartilaginous cranium and the dermal
bone of the skull roof, is of very little significance. No. 9 is of very little importance. No. 11, the relation of the anterior end of the supraorbital canal to the nostril, is of

as in Acanthodians, and not as in Elasmobranchs. Nos. 1 and 10 are dealt with
below.
