In experiments in which the difference of electrical potential was not greater than that
frequently existing between strata of the atmosphere not far from the ground, he
found that filter paper moistened with water and containing 0°010 per cent. of
nitrogen, after a month contained 0°045 per cent., whilst similar paper moistened with
a solution of dextrine had its percentage of nitrogen raised from 0°012 to 0192. He
considered that his experiments indicated the true explanation of the fixation of
nitrogen in nature. The gains are in amount such as would explain how crops
acquire the amounts of nitrogen which he considers they must derive from the
atmosphere.

In the autumn of 1885 (‘Compt. Rend.,’ vol. 101, pp. 775-784) M. BrrtHEtor gave
the results of experiments on the fixation of atmospheric nitrogen by certain
argillaceous earths. He réfers to his experiments which established the fact that
nitrogen was fixed in some of the immediate principles of plants by the agency of
electricity of such feeble tension as is operative all over the globe. He has now to call
attention to another mode in which free nitrogen is brought into combination—namely
by argillaceous soils under the influence of micro-organisms.

He experimented with two argillaceous sands, and two pure clays—crude kaolins,
Some of the experiments were commenced in 1884, but others not until April, 1885;
