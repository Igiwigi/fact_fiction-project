+ It may be well to record an appearance which is sometimes met with, and may lead to error.
ACertain thick non-crystalline joints simulate the presence of an interposed cement, for, on account of
the difference of level between the depth of the joint and the surface, shadows are cast. This is most
clearly shown by the photograph 10 (1000 diameters). The plane etched by aqua regia had not been
repolished after the previous etching by sulphuric acid. It looks as if a film of foreign substance
was interposed between two neighbouring grains, but, on looking at it closer, it is evident that the
traces of this film join those of one of the grains, and it is not possible to admit a doubt that we have
merely to deal with the structure of pure gold. ;

} By the expression “ thickness of a joint,” we understand, in the case of the crystalline joints, the
sum of the joint properly so-called, and of the crystalline border, which it is usually impossible to
separate from it. We have, in fact, measured in all cases the thickness of the dark line. It must not
be forgotten that it is a question of the apparent dimensions, which are much exaggerated by the
etching.

fissures, the thickness equals 1 » to 5 p, or a mean thickness of 2°5 p. Generally speak-
ing the condition of these joints appears to be closely related to the mechanical
properties of the alloy (table, p. 418.).
