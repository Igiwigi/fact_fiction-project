This indicates voltage variation resilience in the perceptron design.

— The input duty cycle has limited range—from 20 to 70%. Beyond this range the output
stops oscillating and becomes a constant signal.

The observed reduction of operational range and loss of linearity in the voltage to PWM :8
converter are caused by the fact that the voltage DCsum powers the voltage to PWM converter. ae
When the input duty cycle is above 70%, DCsum is below 30% of Vag. For Vaq = 2.5V this is below : &
the threshold voltage. And in this case the NMOS transistors of the ring oscillator are always off, : ~
and the output stops oscillating.
