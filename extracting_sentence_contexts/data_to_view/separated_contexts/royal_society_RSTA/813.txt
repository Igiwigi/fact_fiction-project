The word ‘mechanics’ without a qualifier, however, is a Trojan horse. Targue that the Greek soldiers hiding inside the Trojan horse—and coming out of it much later
in the fully developed theory—are the physical primitives contained in the axioms, i.e. in the
same laws of mechanics. In fact, being physical, the primitives require either a theoretical or an
operational definition. This means that, in both cases, they are not actually primitive, implying
that the logical feedback from their definition towards the same theory is prone to be logically not
coherent. Let us analyse the case of mechanics. ‘Mechanics’ means dealing with ‘forces’ and their effects
on ‘bodies’.
