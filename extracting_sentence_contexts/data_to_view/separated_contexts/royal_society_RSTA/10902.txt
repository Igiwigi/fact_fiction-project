If by any
fortuitous oscillation a radial rib arises, this will be a channel in which the liquid,
being farther from the surface, will be less affected by the viscous drag; it will
therefore be a channel of more rapid flow and diminished pressure, into which,
therefore, the neighbouring liquid will be drawn from either side. Thus a rib once
formed is in stable equilibrium, and will correspond to a jet at the edge of the rim. This explains the persistence of the ribs when once established, and we may attribute
their regular distribution to the fact that they first originate in the spontaneous
segmentation of the annular rim at the edge of the advancing sheath. This
explanation receives unexpected confirmation in the appearance of the lop-sided
splashes of Series XX., in which we see, firstly, that the flutings are absent from that
part of the sheath which has left the sphere, and, secondly, we see how much higher
in every case the continuous film has risen in that part which has left the sphere than
in the part which has clung to it, and has been hindered by the viscous drag. Especially is this the case in fig. 3, Series XXVI. (see p. 196),â€™where the liquid was
pure glycerine.
