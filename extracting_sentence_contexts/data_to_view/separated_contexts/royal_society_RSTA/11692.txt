If, on the other hand, two
potentials and two times sufficiently far apart for accuracy are observed, an assump-
tion of a law of resistance (generally Oum’s) requires to be made in order to integrate
the equation (Gray, ‘Absolute Measurements,’ &c., p. 404), since, in the case of a
very high resistance, the fall of potential is a small fraction of the total voltage only. This assumption, although philosophically repugnant, probably does not produce any
very disastrous effects on the subsequent statement of results. An objection of
greater gravity lies in the fact that very often the capacity of the quadrants of the
electrometer cannot be neglected, and as these are affected by electric absorption
(with electrometers constructed with glass insulation), a source of uncertainty is
introduced. If the potential-time-curve-slope be used to give a value of the equiva-

lent resistance for a definite potential, when neither the capacity of the quadrants
nor the leakage of the electrometer can be neglected, then the formula of calculation
becomes arithmetically very objectionable. This is by no means a slight disadvantage
if many results have to be reduced.
