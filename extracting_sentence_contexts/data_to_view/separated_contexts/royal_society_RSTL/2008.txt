The opposite tides which meet in the North Sea do not
meet in a line directly across any part of it, but in a diagonal line extending
from the Kentish Knock to the entrance of the Sleeve;” which seems to imply
that the tide on the Danish coast comes from the S.W. He adds, © In fact,
there is hardly any tide observable between the Hoorn reef and the entrance
of the Sleeve.”

'The 7* tide line on the Ower shoal is further back than the same line on the
$hore; which, being contrary to the course of single tides, appears to indicate 5
there a tide of interference ; the absence of tide on the coast of Jutland is also k
probably the result of interference, for the tides at Heligoland are said to rise |
9 feet (Nozs). If we suppose the southern and northern tides to reach this
space at an interyal of 6 hours, —for instance, if the tide-hours for these tides |
be respectiyely 3) and 9,—the tide will be altogether obliterated by their com-

bination. We may therefore account for seyeral of the facts, by supposing the 9 tide-
line to advance from the north in a convex form, 80 as to approach this part ;
and the southern tide to move 80 as to produce the lines 12", 1, 2b, 3b on the
coast of Denmark, if it were single.
