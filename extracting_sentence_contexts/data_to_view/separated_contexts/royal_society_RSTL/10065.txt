The arm and wing

= inherit their homology from the anterior limb of the common ancestor of man and the
©S birds, but man's arm and leg have no common ancestor more recent than the limb of
Z the parent of the imaginary metameres which gave origin, by their union, to the ancestor
= of the Vertebrates, and the common ancestor of the right and left arms must have been
S till more remote. d

© When we compare man's arm and leg we find that they have homologous features
= which are nob only more recent than the time when man's ancestors diverged from the
2 ancestors of the birds, but more recent than the separation of the anthropoid and
S 8imian s8tems. They resemble each other in the texture of the skin and in the shape
© of the nails, and these resemblances are strictly homological, that is, they are not
= due to external conditions, but in spite of them ; and we meet with countless similar
2 resemblances all through the animal kingdom. They are not accounted for by the
= ©*metamere ” theory, even if this is fully accepted, for in many cases they are not old,
> bub are of recent acquisition.

= In the case of the Crustacea the assumption that the remote ancestor of the group
& had a many-jointed body does not account for them ; and as the supposed necessity
for an explanation of serial homology is the only reason for believing that this remote
S ancestor had a great number of body-segments, it is clearly illogical to reject the
— embryological evidence that this ancestor was a three-jointed Nauplins, in order to
S hold an hypothesis which fails to account for the facts which are supposed to render it
E necessary. EXPLANATION OF THE PLATES. All the figures where the magnifying power is not stated were drawn with a power
