Bunsen flame, ;4srd of a milligramme of manganese can be detected (SimMLER) ; but
the quantity of alkalies is much smaller—as, for instance, zpgath of a milligramme of
potassium, goolsooth of lithium, and ygq¢ecc00th of sodium (Kircnnor). The
flame spectrum of manganese is almost entirely a banded spectrum, the peculiarities
of which had not been investigated at that time.

Stttm1an had urged against this view of Wepprne :—Ist. If the disappearance of
the manganese lines in the Bessemer spectrum be owing to the diminution of the
quantity of manganese, we should infer that these lines would gradually grow more
indistinct, and then fade away ; but the fact is the contrary—the manganese spectrum
increases in brillianey from its first appearance, and is more intense just before being
swept away than at any other time. The analysis of the fume which appears when
the flame ceases, proves that a considerable quantity of manganese is still volatilized ;
and it is notable that in manganiferous iron this quantity increases towards the close
of the “blow.” 2nd. It would be more difficulé to account by this theory for the
non-appearance of the sodium line at the beginning of the “ blow,” as sodium then, in
all probability, exists in the issuing gas in sufficient quantity to produce its spectrum
at a high temperature, as it is only by special precautions that we can keep it out of
any flame. 3rd. A still greater difficulty would arise in applying this theory to the
spectra of sodium and Jithium at the close of the ‘‘blow.” As has been stated, these
lines sometimes disappear at the moment of complete decarburization, and sometimes
remain. In the former case to say that the sodium had been exhausted would not be
