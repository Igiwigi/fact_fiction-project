put beyond all doubt by actual experiment with the oxyhydrogen blowpipe flame. This explains the fact observed by BRUNNER, namely, that when a converter is being
heated with coke after it has been used, but not re-lined, the spectrum of the Bessemer
flame makes its appearance. 5. The luminosity of the flame during the “ boil” is due, not only to the combustion
of highly-heated carbonic oxide, but also to the presence of the vapours of iron and
manganese in the gas.
