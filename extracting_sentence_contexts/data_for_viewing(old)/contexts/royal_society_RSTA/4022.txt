consistent with arguments on the necessity of adequate proppant placement [64]. As proppants
are unlikely to penetrate tight fractures in the damage zone, this region must involve shear
fracturing if it is to lead to enhanced gas migration. However, our results [41,43] also show that
large strain (or strain localization) is needed to create new shear fractures. In addition, these
fractures have permeability that may be limited by ductile deformation in shale that is either clay-
rich or at sufficiently great depth. Nonetheless, fracturing at the meso-scale can lead to significant
localized permeability gains (0 to 5 orders of magnitude), which is likely to significantly enhance
intermediate-time production.

At the pore scale, one of the main concerns is the presence of water. Water, naturally present or
apparently lost during the initial fracturing operations, predominantly resides in the matrix [26].

From an environmental point of view, this fact suggests that it is unlikely that water will leave
the shale formation and will not impact the water resources outside the formation if fractures do
not extend beyond the shale formation. However, it has a negative impact on the extraction of
hydrocarbons due to the possibility of flow blocking. Our results suggest that use of scCO2 or
other miscible solvents in re-stimulation operations can increase of the life of fracking wells. Our
high pressure/temperature microfluidic experiments indicate that in oil-wet rocks (e.g. shale),
hydrocarbon is better mixed with scCO} in the presence of a low miscible phase (i.e. water) than
in its absence. Hydrocarbon is more easily recovered in oil-wet reservoir rocks (e.g. shale) even
though mobile brine is present as a consequence of heterogeneity-induced mixing [58], which is
not the case in water-wet reservoir rocks (e.g. sandstone [65]). These experiments were carried out
in engineered material micromodels because they provide exceptional control over micromodel
