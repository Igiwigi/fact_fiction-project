Beyond this its real affinities are, as yet, uncertain. Many of its features
suggest a relationship with the Ferns, but since no traces of its foliage have yet been
discovered, this affinity cannot at present be determined. It is a curious fact that we

have as yet only discovered the leaves of one of the many supposed Fernstems which
I have described—and that is precisely the one (Lygynodendron Oldhamium) the
general features of which, at the first glance, were the least suggestive of any affinities
with the Filicine. Most of our recent ferns have their vascular bundles composed
of a xylem element associated with a concentric phloém, but this was certaiuly not
the case with all the Carboniferous Ferns. In the Myelopteris described in my
Memoir VII., I found vacant spaces associated with the vascular bundles ; I erroneously
confounded these spaces with the gum-canals which are so abundant in the same
Stems.
