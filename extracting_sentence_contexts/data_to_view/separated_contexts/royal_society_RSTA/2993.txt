Tables III. and V. The observational data are exactly the same, and at first sight it
may appear strange that the mean ranges in Table VI. are as a rule not equal to but
greater than the ranges in Table III. This is due simply to the fact that the hours
of maxima and minima vary slightly from year to year. The greater this variation
the more does the mean in Table VI. exceed that in Table III. On the average of
the 12 months the mean range in Table VL. is almost exactly 1 per cent.
