Kinkajou (Cercoleptes caudivolvulus) has a red peripheral zone with a yellowish-green
tapetum, with yellow and green dots and streaks and a cup-shaped disc, thus some-
what resembling the Sand Badger. The Ringtailed Coati (Nasua rufir) has a brown
peripheral area and a bright green tapetum with yellowish patches, an appearance
common to all the Bears. The dise is round in all the Procyonidee, with the excep-
tion of the Racoon. The Membrana nictitans of the latter is vestigial as in ourselves,
whilst in the Kinkajou it is well developed, and forms with the conjunctiva a sort of
loose bag which contracts over the cornea; an arrangement which we shall find in
some of the other animals, which, like the Kinkajou, have the power of withdrawing
their eyes into the socket. This is still more marked in the Bears and common to a
number of the lower Mammals. The Coati, like the Bears, has a Membrana nictitans,
which it only uses when sleepy. The resemblance of the Racoon to the Polecat and
of the Coati to the Bears, as well as the fact that all through the Mustelide, Pro-
cyonidee, and Ursidee we find the erystalline appearance of the pigment in the
fundus, and the concentric arrangement of the lens fibres already referred to, shows
that, with the exception of the Canadian Skunk, the classification according to the
eye agrees with that of Gapow which I am following.

7. Urside.â€”The Syrian (Ursus syriacus), the Black (Ursus americanus), the
Malay (U. malayanus), and the Sloth Bear (Ursinus malursus) have practically the
same fundus; a central area covered with yellow patches and a purple or purple-
brown densely-pigmented peripheral area. In the Black Bear and the Sloth Bear,
orange pigment is distributed on the border line between the two zones, and in the
Malay Bear the peripheral pigment extends into the green in the form of light
purple patches. The discs are all round and more or less cupped. The pupils are
