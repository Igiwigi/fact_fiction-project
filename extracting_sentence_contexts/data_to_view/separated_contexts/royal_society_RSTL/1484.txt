For ammonia = - - DE LEP 2+ C77. - ,
Now, if these data be calculated upon, it will be found, that
in the decomposition of 100 of ammonia, taking even the
largest proportions of gasses evolved ; there is a loss of =.
and if the smallest proportion be taken the loss will be
nearly -. These results and calculations agree with those that I have
before given, and with those of Dr. Hensy. The lately discovered facts in chemistry, concerning: the
important modifications which bodies may undergo by very
Slight additions or subtractions of new matter, ought to ren-
der us cautious in deciding upon the nature of the process of
the electrical decomposition of ammonia. * 100 of ammonia at the rate of 185, will give 136.9 of hydrogene, weighing 3.1
grains, and 48.1 of nitrogene weighing 14.33 grains ; but 18.4 — 17.4 = 1, and at
the rate of 180, 133 of hydrogene weighing 3.01 and 47 of nitrogene, weighing we
and 18,4 — 17 = 1:4. ome new Objects in Chemical Philosophy.
