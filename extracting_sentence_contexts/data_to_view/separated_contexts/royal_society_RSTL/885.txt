of minute parallel grooves inclined about 20* 57 to the

have never failed toobserve the fact of the arrangement
and bursting of the vesicles, and I have no hesitation-in con-
cluding, that the carbonic acid is arranged in planes passing
through the axis of the crystal, a result-which I had for-
merly assumed in explaining the phenomena of double re-
fraction. This method of studying the structure of bodies by
watching them in the process of disintegration, may be found
to have a very extensive application in chemical and. mine-
ralogical enquiries.
