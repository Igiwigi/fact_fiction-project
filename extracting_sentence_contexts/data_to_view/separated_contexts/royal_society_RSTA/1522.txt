The pioneering papers of Vilhelm
Bjerknes (e.g. [15]) are often used as a signpost marking the beginning of dynamical meteorology,
and we choose to use Vilhelm Bjerknes to highlight a fundamental dialectic that has enlivened
the field since the beginning, and to this day, as we shall see below. Bjerknes pioneered the
use of partial differential equations (the first use of the ‘primitive equations’) to represent the
state of the circulation and its time evolution, but closed-form solutions were hard to come by. Numerical methods were also immature, and basic facts about the computational stability of
the methods were yet unknown. The failed attempts by Richardson [16] involving thousands of
human ‘computers’ are also well documented. One could consider it the first attempt at parallel
processing, and at 64000 ‘cores’, it would be considered still quite cutting-edge today!.
