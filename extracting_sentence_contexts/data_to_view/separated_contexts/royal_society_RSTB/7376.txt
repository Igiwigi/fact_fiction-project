In practice, by following the genetic spiral through the consecutive leaf-bases
round a more or less elongated stem, two leaves were sought, such that the upper was
superposed precisely over the lower; if the genetic spiral made ¢ revolutions between the
insertions of these two leaves, separated by n internodes, the divergence was evidently ¢/n. Extensive observations of this kind led to the belief that much the most frequent divergences
are those that fall into the series 4, 4, 2, 3, 35;, ..., in which either the numerators or the
denominators of the fractions, considered alone, are the successive members of the well-
known Fibonacci series. An obvious practical objection to the method is the difficulty of determining whether
any particular leaf is in fact exactly superposed by some other one; and even assuming that
one such exists it is frequently impossible to decide which leaf fulfils this condition. In spiral
phyllotaxis the few rational divergence angles solely recognized by Schimper and Braun
fail completely to describe the true conditions at the plant apex, and presumably this is
true also of elongated organs. They exist only where orthostichy lines can be found, i.e.
where series of leaves or primordia occur alined along the axis of the stem instead of spiral-
ling more or less steeply round it, and in spiral phyllotaxis no true orthostichies appear.
