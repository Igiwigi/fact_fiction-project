It would
look as if the series of long links should be 3773°59, 3778°77, 3778°77, z.e., uw(—8),
u(—38), u(—38), but that the last for some reason took ~ (—2é) at first but completed
the extra (—é) in the next link. The formule in this chain, as will be seen, involve
very few displaced links beyond those it started with, due to the above indubitably
enlarged e links. In fact such only enter in No, 21 and in 25, 26, which latter form
part of a mesh. On the other hand, as will be seen below, the formule based on
D(5) show very good links up to 29514 and even beyond. Provisionally I have
placed the spurious link as that between 29514 and 30394 with a = 878°72 in place
of 880°77.
