A, with a large central chamber 200-400 p in diame
and with an outside diameter of the shell of 2°10 millim.; and B, with a small cent
chamber 20 in diameter, and an outside diameter varying from 1°5 millim. 2°64 millim. The interesting fact was also brought forward, that in this group the:
is a very marked difference in the mode of growth of the two forms. While in ti
form A, the arrangement of the chambers following the central one is biloculine fro:
the first, in the form B the chambers. following the minute central chamber ai
arranged at first on the quinqueloculine plan, the biloculine arrangement not bein,
attained, in B. depressa, until the eleventh chamber is formed.
