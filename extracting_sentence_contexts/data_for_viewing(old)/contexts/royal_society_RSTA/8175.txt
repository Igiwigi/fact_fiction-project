empirical formula .

s = 0-422 cos Y=

where s is the spacing between the ridges in em., y is the distance of the ridge concerned
from the antinode, and yo is the distance between two nodes. Rosinson obtained,
from Kornia’s theory, formule in which the spacing was proportional to cos - ™

(original theory) and to cos 2” “= (revised theory). Our measurements allow us to

fix the index to within about 2 per cent., which shows once more that Roprnson’s
theory does not represent, even approximately, the experimental facts.

The spacing actually depends on the size of the vortices. The dependence of the
size of the vortex on the amplitude of the air motion, other things being equal, has not
been measured.

8. Explanation of the Dust Phenomena.

The phenomena to be explained are :

1. The characteristic differences between the behaviour of heavy particles and light
particles, originally noted by Kunpr.
