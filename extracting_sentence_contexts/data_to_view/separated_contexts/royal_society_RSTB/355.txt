In fact, in the case of the
22nd generation, the whole of the ammonia had been almost quantitatively converted
into nitrous nitrogen. That in the case of “ Bottle No. 1 (2nd generation),” the sum of the ammoniacal
and nitrous nitrogen is in slight excess of the ammoniacal nitrogen present in ihe
original solution employed is probably due to the bottle in which this 2nd generation
had undergone nitrification having been considerably larger than the others, and
consequently more concentration by evaporation through the cotton-wool stopper
must doubtless have taken place. In order to put this point to the test, we, later on (February 15, 1890), again took
a similar large bottle, in fact, a duplicate of No. 1 above, and found

Nas NH, = 453 parts per 100,000
Nas N,O, = 8:00 $
Total N = 12:53 PS

thus clearly showing that the excess of total nitrogen in these large bottles was due
to the greater amount of concentration by evaporation through the cotton-wool
stoppers. The exclusive production of nitrous nitrogen in these experiments is of special
interest, as it raises the possibility of there being distinct organisms concerned in the
formation of nitrites and nitrates respectively ; whilst, on the other hand, it is by no
means impossible that the formation of nitrate may yet take place in these solutions,
or that the same organism may produce nitrates under other conditions.
