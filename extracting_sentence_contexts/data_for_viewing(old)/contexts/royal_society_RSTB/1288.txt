septum, may on occasions form spores. The conclusion is that, in dealing w
cases, the presence or absence of trabeculz or a septum is a phenomenon of ge
moment from the point of view of homology, and, in fact, there is no essential
to recognizing homologies, between parts of which one may be partially or eg
septate, the other non-septate.*

From the facts and the reasoning thus briefly stated, I conclude that the ;
of Tmesipteris is homologous with the sporangium of other Lycopodinee, the
correspondence being with Lepidostrobus and Isoetes. It may be looked upo
amendment on the type of sporangium in these plants; their trabeculae,
irregular, doubtless yielded physiological, and possibly also mechanical, supp
comparatively slight rearrangement and consolidation of the trabecular ti
Isoetes or of Lepidostrobus might result in the complete partition of the spor
into two loculi, as it is seen normally in Jmesipteris ; or the converse view is
viz., that the imperfectly septate sporangia of the type shown in Lepidost
Isoetes may have resulted from reduction of completely septate types. This qt
will be discussed later. At present it may be stated that the former view see
more probable.
