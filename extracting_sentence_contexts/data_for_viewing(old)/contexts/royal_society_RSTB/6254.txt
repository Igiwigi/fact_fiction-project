any evidence of corticipetal connections by the Marchi method after localized
electrolytic lesions involving the nucleus, or by the method of retrograde degeneration
after a lesion of the frontal cortex. Hence we can state with confidence that the
centre median nucleus is almost certainly not connected directly with the cerebral
cortex. It may also be noted that one of us has argued, on the basis of comparative
anatomical studies, that this nucleus is probably to be regarded as an intra-thalamic
mechanism concerned with the integration of the activities of other thalamic
elements (CLark 1932, a).* Sacer (1933) reports cytological changes of very
slight degree in the centre median nucleus after lesions of the frontal lobe in two
monkeys, and concludes “ qu’il est en relation d’une part, avec l’écorce frontale
et d’autre part, avec la zone corticale correspondent 4 la face.’ His microphoto-
graphs, however, are far from convincing and we think it probable that his conclusion
rests on an error of interpretation, related to the fact that the centre median nucleus
in normal brains shows a certain degree of individual variation in the density and
spacing of its constituent cells. Until and unless more convincing evidence of a
positive nature is forthcoming, the conception of a direct cortical connection of the
nucleus should be abandoned.

* Sacer (1933, p. 115) is in error in attributing to one of us the statement that the centre median
nucleus is in relation with the frontal cortex.
