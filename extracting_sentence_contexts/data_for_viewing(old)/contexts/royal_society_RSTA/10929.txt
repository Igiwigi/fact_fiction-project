mixture of Cu,Sn and liquid, a reaction that becomes much more marked in the
succeeding alloys. If this be the right explanation of the singularity, then the
reaction occurs at a slightly higher temperature than in the case of alloys
with more tin. This, again, may be due to the fact that when the change,
y = Cu,Sn + liquid, takes place in Sn 26, there are already crystals of Cu,Sn in the
alloy which may serve as nuclei and precipitate the reaction. In order to verify this
cooling curve we repeated it with a different pyrometer and a fresh sample of alloy,
and found the same phenomenon.

Sn 27. 40°8 per cent. of tin.

In the cooling curve of this alloy the second and third halts are completely merged
into one. In fact, the solidus and the liquidus meet very near here at the
temperature of the G point, and the possibility of a uniform solid solution ceases,
The meeting of these two curves at the G temperature is, as Professor Roozesoom
has pointed out to us, a theoretical necessity.

Sn 27. Sic. chill at 700° (not reproduced).

This ingot is still covered externally with large rounded rosettes of y in relief.
When cut and polished, about half the surface of the section consists of similar
rounded combs, the rest consisting of chill primary immersed in a slender, bright
network of the tin-rich residue of mother-substance. The FeCl, etch blackens this
network, The surface of the large y combs is quite uniform and free from inclusions
