The femur and tibia are very closely correlated; the former in the male would
appear to be about equally correlated with the humerus and radius, but on comparing
the male and female series it may perhaps be said that the femur is slightly less
correlated with the radius than with the humerus. In the ease of the tibia, on the
other hand, there is apparently a somewhat stronger correlation with the radius than
with the humerus. Perhaps we ought to expect this from the fact that the femur
and humerus, and the tibia and radius, are serially homologous. Everywhere, except in the case of the humerus and radius, the maximum length of
the humerus is seen to be a little more strongly correlated with the other bones than
is the oblique length of the humerus. Both in the male and female series the oblique
length of the humerus is the dimension which is the more closely correlated with the
radius.
