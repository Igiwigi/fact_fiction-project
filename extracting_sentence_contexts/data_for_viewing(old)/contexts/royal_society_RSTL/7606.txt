dually fade away. The engraving faithfully represents the object as it may be seen on
any clear night, and the details are 80 well marked that no material change can take
place hereafter which will not at once be recognized with an instrument of similar
power. The interior of the trapezium has not been examined recently with the view
to the question whether it is absolutely dark. With the 6-feet instrument the eye is 80
dazzled by the light of the four stars that it is difficult to form an accurate opinion ;
and any nebulosity which may exist, is probably too faint to affect the spectroscope. I
am not certain that any part of the nebula is absolutely free from nebulosity, but the
contrast is 80 great between the dark spaces alluded to by Sir Jonn HERsCHEL, and the
contiguous portions of the nebula, that even in the drawing it was scarcely possible to
indicate nebulosity 80 slightly as not to interfere with the proper gradation of light ; in

fact it was scarcely possible to represent the bright parts sufficiently bright.
