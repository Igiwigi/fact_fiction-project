decreases, and is, in fact, roughly proportional to the frequency, thus indicating that
the whole band is governed by a single characteristic frequency. It has, however,
already been shown, in §8 above, that the molecular extinction coefficients of all

the xanthates of this series can be represented to a very close approximation by the

Since the factor g is approximately proportional to the frequency v, it should be possible
