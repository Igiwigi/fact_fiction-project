(c) Though similar to leucocytes in their detachable nature, they are much
larger than the maternal leucocytes, have dense instead of clear cytoplasm,
and no intermediate stages exist. Moreover, the supply throughout
pregnancy is so great that one cannot account for their origin in this way.

It should be noticed that the destruction of the uterine epithelium is clearly due
