of the Insectivora and Edentata when I directed the light from the ophthalmoscope
close to the dise was especially marked.

To sum up: Sensitive areas of restricted dimensions, omitting those cases in which
the area is limited to a macula, exist in the Carnivora, in which order the divergence
is not great. In the Ungulates, Rodents, Edentates, and Marsupials, where we find
great divergence of axes, large cornew, and nearly spherical lenses, the sensitive
areas are larger, and probably the degree of difference in perception over such areas,
compared with the more peripheral parts, is but little marked. This leads to the
consideration whether binocular vision is possible without convergence, even in animals
with a great divergence of the optic axes. The great extent of their sensitive areas,
the shape of the often large pupil—especially the horizontally oval pupil—and the
refraction, favour this hypothesis. _Hereto comes another fact which I have observed,
viz., that the cornea is much larger in those animals which have a divergence of more
than 50° or 60°. In addition, these animals have nearly spherical lenses. Evidently
these latter facts are of much greater importance than the size of the pupil, as we
know by analogy with a camera, that the size of the stop does not affect the field or
angle of view, which is solely dependent on the shape of the lenses in the combina-

tion, and their proximity to each other, and to the diaphragm. It is evident that the
increased size of the cornea will allow rays of much greater obliquity to be refracted
into the eye, and a spherical lens will diminish the distortion produced by the focus of
