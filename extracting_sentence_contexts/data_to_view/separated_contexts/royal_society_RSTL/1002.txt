These experiments I have very often made, andthe results
are perfectly conclusive; .and inthe <case, page 26, in which
sulphuricacid seemed to pass in 3mall quantities through very
weak ;solutions-of strontites.and barytes, I have no doubt but
that it was carried through by means of a thin 8tratum of pure
water, where the solution;had been decomposed at the surface
by carbonic acid; for in an 'experiment similar to these in
which the film of carbonate of barytes was often removed
and the fluid agitated, mo particle of ;sulphuric-acid appeared
in the positive part-of the-chain, : 1

It is easy to explain, from the general phanomena of ide-
composition {and transfer, the mode in which o.zygene and hy-
drogene are Separately evolved from water. The-oxygene of a
portion of waters attracted by the poxitive surface; at the/same
time that the other constituent part; the hydrogene is repelled
by-it; and the opposite process takes place at the negative -$ur-
face ; and in the middle or neutral point of the circuit, whether
there be a series of decompositions and recompositions, or
whether'the particles from the extreme points only are active,
there must be anew combination of the repelled matter : and
the case is analogous to'that of two,portions of muriate-of soda
Separated by. distilled water ; muviatic acid is repelled from the
negative side, and -soda from the positive/side, ahd mubiate of
Soda is composed in the middle yessel. These facts seem fully to invalidate the \conjectures of M. RiTtTER, and 'some other philosophers, with regard to the
elementary nature -of water, and perfectly to confirm the
great discovery of Mr. CAVENDISH.
