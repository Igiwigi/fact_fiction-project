where rs =max((r, |1’|) and r< =min((r|, |r|). The integral over the angle can be immediately
carried out using the orthogonality of trigonometric functions: Se d¢’ cos[n(¢ — ¢')] = 5n0. The


remaining radial integral can be then straightforwardly calculated

| arog (=) =r-R-+Riog (4). (A3)

I =-2n [r+ 8I08()].

To calculate the integral Iz, we can make use of the fact that

Thus,

rT a
—+.=— | 4 |. A4
Pore = ay el (A4)

Thus, one can write
h=xy. {ar d¢’ log |r — H\— = [dr'ag'e log |r — 1’ |. (A5)

The first integral is calculated by differentiating 1,
