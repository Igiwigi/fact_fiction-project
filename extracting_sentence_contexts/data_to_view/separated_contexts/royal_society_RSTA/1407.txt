It should be noted that the affinity, and as such,
the wettability, of the latex will be substantially different for less hydrophilic probes (or other
adherends). We hypothesized that the work of adhesion (measured on the nanoscale) required to detach
the colloid probe from these latex films would be correlated to the tack and peel strength of
the PSAs; however, this was not the case. The linear trend of increasing work of adhesion as
a function of CNC loading was, in fact, not representative of the trends for EHA/BA/MMA
PSAs where the tack or peel strength initially increased with increasing CNC loading (from
0 to 0.5 wt%) but then decreased above 0.5 wt% CNCs [6]. The previously reported peel strengths
