fully examined all the published cases accessible to me, and I generally find that T can
anderstand and enter fully into the feelings of the witnesses; can put myself in their
places, and see, as it were, with their eyes; and, recollecting what my ideas of my own
censations once were, I feel I can adopt by far the greater part of the testimony as
my own. The explanation of my case comprebends and accounts for, with trifling
exceptions, the whole varied range of symptoms described by others; and I think there
are fair grounds for believing that the few discrepancies that exist are but apparent,
and admit of being satisfactorily explained away, on the grounds above alluded to. It
appears to me, therefore, a reasonable inference, that the great majority of cases of
colour-blindness hitherto described, correspond in general nature with my own.

26. And I think there must be great difficulty in finding any hypothesis, except that
of perfect dichromic vision, which will satisfactorily account for the facts observed.
Take for instance the most common symptom, the confounding of red and green. If it
be assumed that either of the colours presents its proper sensation to the colour-blind, it
is difficult to avoid the inference that this colour ought always to be recognized ; but
this is not 80, red and green being generally both mistaken.

It has been sometimes thought that red may be visible only in a partial degree; but I
can scarcely conceive what a partial vision of red can mean, or what mistakes of colour
it ought to giverise to; for it would be only a perversion of language to say that red is
partially visible when it appears yellow, green, or grey. Ifredis really the most poxitive
and individual of all colours, as it is usually described, one would think that any percep-
tion of its true sensation should lead to a much more perfect and consistent identifica-
tion of it than is generally found in the colour-blind. I am not only sure of my own
