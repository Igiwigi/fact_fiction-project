(6) The Relation between the Pressure and the Displacement.—In the foregoing it
has been taken for granted that the relation between the pressure and the displace-
ment is a linear one, and there is no doubt that this is approximately the case, but it
is worth while examining the diagrams carefully to see if there is any indication of a
departure from this relationship and, if so, in what direction. In Diagram 1, which shows the amounts of the displacements at different pressures,
the values are higher at intermediate pressures than they should be if a straight line
is to describe the relationship correctly—the lines are, indeed, slightly curved, being
concave towards the axis of zero displacement. Diagram 4 puts the matter more clearly; in it each line represents the mean
displacement per atmosphere at different pressures, and the fact that the displace-
ments have been divided by a quantity which is constant for any one line need not
affect our discussion. Leaving out of consideration the values at 5, 10, and even 20
