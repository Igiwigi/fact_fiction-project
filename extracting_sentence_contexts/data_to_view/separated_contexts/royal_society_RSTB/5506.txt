If we observe the position of the primitive streak in
Srreve’s figures, we notice that as we pass back in the series the streak gradually
approaches nearer to the right margin of the embryonal shield ; the cloacal membrane
(in Srteve’s fig. 31) being situated actually at that margin. This fact clearly indicates

that the specimen is not cut transversely. We have estimated that the sectional
plane forms an angle of about 64° with the median plane, and an angle of about 26°
with the transverse plane, and is perpendicular to the embryonal shield.
