'= +0°5865530, m= +1°659250. . (154)
No check is needed on the accuracy of these values beyond the fact that they
satisfy the equations. On substituting directly into the equations, I find that they
are all satisfied accurately to the last place of decimals. The corresponding values of L, M, N, /, m, n (see opposite page) are
L= —11°71505.
