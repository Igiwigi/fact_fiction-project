the number of bands seen in the whole spectrum in the case of the two systems re-
spectively, If the plate should be thick enough to exhibit both systems, the light
would of course have to be circularly analysed to show one system by itself.

10. The explanation of the formation of the bands on the imperfect theory of
interferences considered in the preceding section is essentially defective in this re-
spect, that it 8upposes an annihilation of light when two interfering streams are in
opposition ; whereas it is a most important principle that light is never lost by inter-
ference. This statement may require a little explanation, without which it might
seem to contradict received ideas. It is usnal in fact to speak of light as destroyed
by interference. Although this is true, in the sense intended, the expression is per-
haps not very happily chosen. Suppose a portion of light coming from a luminous
point, and passing through a moderately small aperture, to be allowed to fall on a
screen, We know that there would be no sensible illumination on the screen except
almost immediately in front of the aperture. Conceive now the aperture divided into
a great number of small elements, and suppose the same quantity of light as before
to pass through each element, the only difference being that now the vibrations in
the portions passing through the several elements are snpposed to have no relation
to each other. The light would now be diffased over a comparatively large portion
of the screen, 80 that a point P which was formerly in darkness might now be strongly
illuminated. The disturbance at P is in both cases the aggregate of the disturbances
due to the several elements of the aperture; but in the first case the aggregate is
