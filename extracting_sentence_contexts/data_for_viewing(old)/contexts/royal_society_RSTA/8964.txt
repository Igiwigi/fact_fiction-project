The question naturally arises whether lines exist for m = 1. If so the formula gives
a triplet with the first line at 7 = 3142, far in the ultra-red. In other spectra these
values extrapolated for m = 1 differ considerably, often by several hundreds, from the
correct ones. We can only conclude that if there are sets based on m= 1 they
must be such that F, (1) must be in the neighbourhood of 3100. The matter can only
be settled therefore by other considerations which must depend—with our present
knowledge at least—either on sounding or on the presence of combination lines in
the observed region. The evidence for such a triplet is given below in the notes to
the list of lines. The value of F, (1) found is 3010°35 corresponding to a wave-length
in vacuo of 33218°7 A.U. The mantissa of 3010+dn with the limit 30725°26+¢ is
989285+35°9 (dn—€) = 90 {10998°8—"4¢+ "4dn}—611 = 90A,—8. The uncertainty
in A, as found from », is too large to settle the exact value of this with so large a
multiple as 90, but the fact as it stands that the mantissa differs from a multiple of
A, by only a few ouns is what is to be expected if the series belongs to the F type,
and so far certainly supports the more direct evidence given below for the existence of
the set depending on m = 1. With the value of A, found below da = —1’5.

A glance at the list will show that the separations observed in the second and third
orders of F are less than the normal values. This points to a satellite effect. The
values of », are 1862°96, 1863°92 which show deficits of 1°54, ‘58 from the true value
as indicated by the occurrency curve. Now a displacement by one oun produces a
change of 1°25 in m= 2, and ‘50 in m= 3. The deviation is then completely
explained by the supposition of the existence of the satellite effect depending on 4,.
The y, show similar deficits, which may possibly be due to observation errors. We
should expect to find a similar effect (not necessarily the same multiple) in the order
