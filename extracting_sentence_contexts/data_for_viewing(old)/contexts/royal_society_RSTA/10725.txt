OF ERRORS OF JUDGMENT AND ON THE PERSONAL EQUATION. 255

phenomena. ‘The true conclusion appears to be that the range of data upon which
the personal equation is based must be very wide, so as to swamp as far as possible
these sources of variation due to the “atmosphere” of a short consecutive series.
But if such a personal equation be found, what will be its value? It can hardly be
applied satisfactorily to an isolated observation or to a short consecutive series of
observations, for these will of course be influenced by their special atmosphere. It
would only have value for a long series such as it was itself determined for, and such a
series would rarely occur in practice. The fact that in both our series of experiments
the differences between the values of the personal equation as found from short series
are many times the probable error of sampling is very remarkable. I shall refer to it
as “the influence of immediate atmosphere,” where I understand the “atmosphere” to
be compounded of all the little sources which affect either the observed thing or the
observer more or less persistently during a short series. I am prepared to be told

that the influence of immediate atmosphere was something peculiar to our own test
experiments. But I shall require a good deal of the hard logic of experimental facts

to be convinced that it has no existence in astronomical observations. There are

many determinations of astronomical personal equation, but in published data I have
