297. This is a cubic curve, viz. it is a divergent parabola having for axis the line
9: +4y+5=0, and its ordinates parallel to the axis of #; and having moreover a node
at the point &==—1, y=+1, that is, at the node-cusp of the bicorn ; the curve is thus
a nodal cubic; we may trace it directly from the equation, but it is to be noticed that
qua nodal cubic it is a unicursal curve; the coordinates a, y are therefore rationally
expressible in terms of a parameter 4}; and it is easy to see that we in fact have

81(#+1)= Y(4—8),
Ay—1)==4$ (48),

whence also

dy _ —18(þ—4) dx” b(3Þ—16)*
298. We see that
VY=o, gives #=0, y/=—, point at infinity, the direction of the curve parallel
to axis of a.
b=Y, Sp y=0, the origin.
