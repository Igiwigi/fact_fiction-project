Tn conclusion, it is hardly necessary to remark that our formula for the conductivity
of a mixed gas reduces to that for a pure gas on putting p or p’ equal to zero. Since
(as we shall see) D,,, the coefficient of diffusion, varies inversely as the total pressure,
pyD,y is independent of the pressure, as also are all the other quantities entering into
E, F, G, F,; hence the coefficient of conduction of a mixture, like that of a pure gas,
is independent of the total pressure. This has been experimentally verified in the
case of air.t

19. The Coefficient of Viscosity of Mixed G'ases.

The viscosity of mixed gases has been much studied, both theoretically and
experimentally. It is especially interesting on account of the curious fact, first
noticed by Granam (‘ Phil. Trans.,’ 1846), that the addition of a moderate amount of
light gas (hydrogen, in the case mentioned) to a much more viscous and heavy gas
(carbon dioxide) may actually increase the viscosity of the latter. The same
phenomenon was commented on by Maxwett in a Bakerian Lecture (1866), the
gases receiving particular mention being air and hydrogen.

The principal formule which have been deduced for the viscosity of a mixture are
due to Maxwext,{ Punus,§ SurHertAnD,|| and Turesen.1 Of these only the first is
based on an adequate proof, but as it is a particular case of my own formula (got by
putting & = A,/A, = 0°771) it does not need separate discussion. Punus's formula is
based on an ingenious adaptation of the earlier theories of viscosity of a pure gas, and
although, like those theories, it is only approximate, and in some ways not
