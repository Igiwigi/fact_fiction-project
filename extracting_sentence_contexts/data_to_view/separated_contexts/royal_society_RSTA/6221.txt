‘degrees of freedom’ for fitting the model to experimental data, compared to the three parameters —
Ci, Cz and C3. However, one might argue that if the phenomenological constants provide an : 3
acceptable match with experimental data on rubber, they should capture the underlying physics : &
and thus imply reasonable values for the statistical parameters. In fact, for Ogden’s model, it was Ss
shown that the fitted parameters 1, and a; indeed lead to favourable agreement between the as)
series (3.10) and the inverse Langevin function [16]. More members of this family may be identified by travelling new paths within the scheme,
or by increasing the length of each row that represents a step, where both existing approaches
not mentioned here and future developments may serve this purpose. The greatest potential in
this regard is associated with the contribution from topological effects, which was here restricted
only to a simple implementation of the confining tube concept [21,22], and even more limited
to relations between the change of surface elements (3.14) and the tube diameter d.
