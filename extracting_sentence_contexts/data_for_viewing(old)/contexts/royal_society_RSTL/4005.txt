experiment which appears to me to tend to establish the origin of the muscular cur-
rent according to these views.

I prepared a great number of little cones, of about the size of half a frog's thigh,
cutting the yery thin membrane of the caecum intestine into triangular pieces, and
folding them up, and gumming them together upon a little wooden form of a conical
shape. When these cones were dry, I prepared some fibrine by beating up some bul-
lock's blood, the bullock being killed at that moment. I immediately fitted the cones
with this fibrine steeped in blood, and composed a pile of twenty elements precisely
8imilar to the pile of half thighs. This pile did not exhibit the slightest signs of a
current in the most sensible of my galvanometers. Nor is it to be imagined that
there was any want of conductibility in the pile just described ; in fact, I added four
thighs of frogs prepared to the above twenty elements, and I obtained from this pile
a deflection but slightly differing from that which the frogs gave, acting alone. This
fact evidently proves that simple heterogeneity of the animal parts is not sufficient to
produce the muscular current ; this heterogeneity should be such as exists in the
living muscle,
