A PENDULUM FOR THE REDUCTION TO A VACUUM. 447

The yalnes above given are nearly (although not exactly) in proportion to the
cubes of the diameters: but, it is possible that some other element, at present
unknown, may affect the results; and indeed some portion of the air may adhere
to, or be dragged by the sides of the sphere. As the exact measure of these
three brass spheres was, however, a matter of importance in this inquiry, I exa-
mined them more minutely, and found them to be 1-465, 2065, and 3-030 inches
respectively. So that the weight of adhesive air for the last two spheres will
be almost exactly as the cubes of their diameters; and, for the first two, not,
materially differing therefrom. In fact, if the weights of air were 387, 1084,
and 3:422 grains respectively, the whole would agree precisely with this hypo-
thesis. Tt is worthy of remark that, in the case of the spheres No. 1 to 7, sus-
pended by a wire (se the Table in page 433), and No. 66 in the following set,
if we consider the weight of air, dragged by the wire alone, as equal to 0:10
grain, and deduct this yalue successively from the mean weight of air dragged
by the 1:46 and the 2:06 inch spheres respectively, as there given, and by the
3:03 inch brass sphere as given in the following set of experiments, we shall
have 0373, 1:040, and 3:444 grains for the weight of air dragged by the spheres
alone. $0 that, on the whole, I consider the hypothesis adduced as not far
from the truth ; and that the general expression for the quantity of air dragged
by a pendulum consisting of a sphere suspended by a rod or wire, will be as
follows : viz. F
