been borrowed from the Greek, yet an analogous one could
not have been applied to that of potash, for the ancients do not
5eem to have distinguished between the two alkalies.

The more caution is necessary in avoiding any theoretical
expression in the terms, because the new electro-chemical
phenomena that are daily becoming disclosed, seem distinctly
to shew that the mature time for a complete generalization of
chemical facts is yet far distant ; and though, in the explana-
tions of the various results of experiments that have been
detailed, the antiphlogistic solution of the phenomena has

been rather a sense of its beauty and precisian, than , a _convic-
