The comprehensive work of MacMunn (1885, 1890) showed that many Actiniarians
possessed haematins and their derivatives. The occurrence of these well-known sub-
stances in such simple animals made a great impression upon him. He showed that
in many colour variants of Actinia equina (A. mesembryanthemum), in Tealia felina
(Bunodes crassicornis) and in other species, there existed a pigment which he called
actiniohaematin. This pigment yielded a haemochromogen and a haematoporphyrin
indistinguishable from those of haemoglobin. Because of this, and because of the
capacity of one of the decomposition products of actiniohaematin to undergo reversible
oxidation and reduction, MacMunn concluded that the new pigment possessed a
respiratory function.

Roche (1932, 1936) brings strong evidence that actiniohaematin is not in fact a
pure substance, but a mixture derived from the intracellular respiratory enzyme
systems such as occur in all animals. He relates it to the cytochromes and to Keilin’s
“free intracellular haematins’. He shows that the spectrum corresponds to a mixture
mainly of cytochrome (4) and of parahaematin similar to Keilin’s protohaematin. It
is much stronger in the muscles than in other tissues, and it is best developed in those
species of Actiniarians which have the best developed musculature, such as Tealia
Jelina, Hormathia coronata (Bunodes coronata), and Cereus pedunculatus (Heliactis bellis),
while it is more feebly developed in Anemonia sulcata, Actinia equina, Adamsia palliata
and in the Ceriantharian, Cerianthus membranaceus, which have a weaker musculature.
This agrees with MacMunn’s (1890) observations that in Calliactis (Sagartia) parasitica
actiniohaematin is situated in the endoderm, which contains most of the muscle.
MacMunn showed that even the white variety of Metridium senile (Sagartia dianthus)
