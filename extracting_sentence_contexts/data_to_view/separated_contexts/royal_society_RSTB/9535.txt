However, it is not clear whether the line that we consider to be the most telling, ‘My
face is my fortune’ predates Jenner’s vaccine. It is usually interpreted to mean that as she is poor she depends on being
pretty to marry; we propose it reveals traditional folk knowledge that, being a milkmaid, her face will continue to be
immune from ugly pock marks and she will not succumb to smallpox. In his treatise [39], Jenner does not refer directly to folklore of milkmaids being protected from smallpox by previous
exposure to cowpox but, rather, he comments on the converse: ‘It is a fact so well known among our Dairy Farmers, that
those who have the Small Pox either escape the Cow Pox or are disposed to have it slightly’. However, he did mention his
own observation, before he experimentally vaccinated James Phipps, that those who had acquired cowpox naturally were
immune to variolation and to smallpox. Moreover, awareness of the protective effect of cowpox appears to have been widely
appreciated in the west of England, where 22 years before Jenner, Benjamin Jesty in Dorset had inoculated his wife and two
sons with cowpox, although he did not conduct a scientific study or follow it up with challenge by variolation.
