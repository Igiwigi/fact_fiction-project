2 Thus, relatively to the Earth, the axis of rotation will describe a cone of revolution
ent the mean axis of figure with angular velocity \, the direction of motion in
this cone being the sameéas the direction of the Earth’s rotation. This motion would
Banifest itself by a periodic change in the latitude of places on the Earth’s surface,
& found by astronomical observations.

% The circumstances we have here described are the well-known characteristics of the
Eulerian nutation,* with the additional feature that the axis of figure is displaced by
Gntrifugal force towards the axis of rotation. This latter fact has been assumed by
Sewcomst and other writers{ as the basis of their work. The law of displacement
& the pole of figure assumed by Newcos is, however, not verified. We find
