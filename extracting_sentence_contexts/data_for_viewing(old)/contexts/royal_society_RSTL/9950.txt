are the same for both, and one cannot ensure the coincidence of excitation and polari-
S «ation by separate electrodes. Another contingency capable of vitiating the results
AQ obtained by this same method is, that derived currents may be established through
S the testing electrode of sufficient strength to alter the irritability of the nerve. We
adopted the theory of a mixed polar action for both polarising and testing currents,
as a working hypothesis ab the beginning of our experiments, relying upon the
L following considerations to justify its assumption :—
A (1.) The presence of an anodic make contraction speaks in its fayour, since, given
= the axiom of PrLiuGer and Crauveau, that make contraction is kathodic, break
= contraction anodic, it follows that with anodic make there coexists an associated

2 kathodic make.
5 (2.) The elementary fact that, over certain points of nerve, the museles that contract

-2 at anodic make are not the same as those that contract at anodic break also s8peaks in
2 its favour, since ib indicates that ab the two events the points of excitation are not

identical.
= To denote the nerye-regions that are subjected to the two kinds of influence, we

2 use the terms © polar” and © peripolar.” The area of electrical influence within which
= the density is sufhcient to produce physiological effect is schematically represented as
EZ consisting of a polar region immediately beneath the electrode, in which the electrical
= relation is of the same sign as that, of the electrode, and of a surronnding peripolar
-Z region in which the electrical relation is of the opposite sign (Diagram I.). We hall
