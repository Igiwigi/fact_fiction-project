Then the tectum posterius joins
the parietal plate, while lastly, the synchondrosis orbitoparietalis joins the ala orbitalis
with the parietal plate. In Lepus, however, as the present results show, the tectum posterius has a paired
origin in the form of the supraoccipital cartilages, which chondrify independently of
the occipital arches and of the parietal plates. In fact, the conditions agree with the
interpretation of the posterior region of the skull of Erinaceus, given by Fawcerr
(1918a). First, the supraoccipital cartilage joins the occipital arch, and later the
parietal plate, which is independent of the canalicular capsule. Next, the ala orbitalis
joins the canalicular capsule by the orbitocapsular commissure, and lastly the parietal
plate establishes connexion with this orbitocapsular commissure by means of the
orbitoparietal commissure.
