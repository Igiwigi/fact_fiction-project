Of miscellaneous herbage there was very little increase by the manure, and a falling
off in actual amount over the later years.

The facts relating to the nitrogen bring out more strikingly the characteristic effects
of the mixed mineral manure in fayouring the development of leguminous species. The


EXPERIMENTS ON THE MIXED HERBAGE OF PERMANENT MEADOW. 311

figures given on page 309 show that whilst the percentage of nitrogen in the miscel-
laneous herbage is not much higher than that in the gramineous, the percentage in the
leguminous herbage is very much higher ; in fact, not far from twice as high. The
result is that, although there is by the mineral manure a greater increase in gramineous
than in leguminous hay, a larger proportion of the increase of nitrogen is due to the
leguminous than to the gramineous herbage ; whilst the miscellaneous herbage con-
tributes practically none of the increased yield of nitrogen. Again, whilst in the
unmanured produce the. leguminous herbage has taken up little more than one-fifth as
much nitrogen as the gramineous, in the mineral manured produce there is nearly two-
thirds as much in the leguminous as in the gramineous herbage. Or, to put it in
another way, whilst the average annual amount of nitrogen in the gramineous herbage
was 20 lbs. without, and 29'3 with, the manure, or 9:3 lbs. more with than without it,
it was in the leguminous herbage only 42 Ibs. without, but 18:2 lbs. with the manure,
or 14-0 Ibs. more with than without it.
