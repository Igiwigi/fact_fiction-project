(mPFC spines were not monitored in this study), although 5. Epigenetic modifications and remote memory

spines are known to occur in an engram-specific manner
[29]. In agreement with these ideas, a reduced number
of spines in DG engram cells at 14 days post-training was
recently reported, despite the fact that behavioural fear
expression could be elicited optogenetically (figure 2c) [18]. Collectively, these incongruent findings point to the need
for an alternative explanation to spine dynamics for remote
memory stability. An interesting fact in memory consolidation is the obser-
vation that the longer-lasting it is, the more resistant it
appears to disruption [122,123], giving rise to a consequential
passage of time effect once a commitment for a permanent
change has taken place.
