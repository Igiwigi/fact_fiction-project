Longuet-Higgins, to whom I am considerably indebted
for advice and guidance in the computations which follow. Considering for the moment
uninodal waves only, the equations show that there are three modes of oscillation. One is

associated with the free surface and is in fact the well-known surface seiche; the other two
are internal seiches associated with the two internal interfaces. Displacement at any one
level is due to a combination of all three modes, but maximum displacement due to any
one mode is found at the appropriate interface. In a model which approximates to lake
conditions, the periods of the internal seiches will be very much longer than that of the
surface seiche.
