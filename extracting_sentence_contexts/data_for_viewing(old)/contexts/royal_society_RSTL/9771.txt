The glands in the junction of the esophagus and stomach.-â€”The characteristic
o8ophageal and oxyntic glands just described are separated from one another by inter-
mediate forms. The last two or three millimetres of the cesophagus and the first one
or two millimetres of the stomach contain many transition-forms between the two.
ParTsCH has mentioned that near the stomach the cesophageal glands lose their
complex tubular form and pass into the simple tubular gastric glands. They do not,
however, regularly and in 8uccession become more and more simple ; there are many
regularities. Here and there may occur what is little more than a depression of the
surface epithelium, or there may be a return to the complex gland. The mucous
membrane in this intermediate region is thinner than that either above or below it.
SWIECICKI, from the examination of hardened specimens, described the cophageal
glands as stretching into the cardia, What we, in fact, see when the fresh mucous
membrane is stretched out is that in the intermediate region the glands are fairly
equally scattered throughout, and are not arranged in packets with intervening spaces
as in the cesophagus, bub that, nevertheless, the first part retains the characteristic
cesopbageal gland granules. When this intermediate region is treated with osmic
acid, and subsequently with alcohol, we find that the first simple tubular glands which
occur have rather large yellow-brown-stained cesophageal granules (ep. Plate 77, figs. 1,
2, and 3), whilst farther backwards these granules begin to be replaced in some of the
gland cells by the small brown-black-stained oxyntic-cell granules. We have, then,

* Salt solution makes the glands at firsb more cloudy ; then the cloudiness disappears and the granules
become obvious. :
