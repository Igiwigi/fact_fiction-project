28In a society increasingly ruled by markets and technologies provided by the private sector, it is vital to increase the share
of public funding for academia in order to maintain its public good orientation and independence and to avoid capture by
private interests.


argument of law being too inflexible to take account of technological development is basically
a more elegant way of saying what corporations and neo-liberals have always said: we want
no obligations by law, as with law we can be held accountable through enforcement. Business
has no problem with the fact that any ethics code lacks democratic legitimacy and cannot be
enforced. But, this is actually the core advantage of the law when compared with ethics and
self-regulation in the face of concentration of power in the hands of big corporations: the law
has democratic legitimacy and it can be enforced, even against powerful mega corporations. It
thus creates, combined with a credible threat of deterring sanctions and proper enforcement, a
level playing field beneficial to all and beyond that gives orientation to innovators by providing
incentives directing innovation towards the public interest.

In the world of technological dreams for domination and populist ambition to undermine
democracy, we need to strengthen democracy by giving back to the law the noble function which
it has in constitutional democracy: to express the will of the people in a form obligatory for
everyone and able to be brought into reality, even against resistance and non-compliance, by the
use of public and private enforcement powers.
