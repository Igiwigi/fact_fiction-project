they are faced with a far more serious difficulty. The
number of nuclei in the normal alveolar septum is not sufficient to provide the highly
cellular epithelium which Miller illustrates (1937). Josselyn (1935) had already called
attention to the fact that nuclei, other than those of endothelial cells, ‘are so few in number
in most cases that they appear quite incidental’. This aspect is considered in detail in the
next section. Nuclear counts of the alveolar septum of the adult rabbit

In thick sections of the lung where it is possible to study the whole extent of an alveolar
septum, it is a striking fact that the distribution of nuclei is not regular.
