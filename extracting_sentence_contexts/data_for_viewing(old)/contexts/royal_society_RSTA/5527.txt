structure of a reaction—-diffusion problem. For exponential isotropic growth, the dilution term :s
in fact becomes constant, so that homogeneous steady states on a static domain can be used to :s
find homogeneous steady states in such a growing domain with the kinetics modified by this ‘8

constant term. Under the further assumption that this growth is sufficiently slow, Madzvamuse
et al. [135] showed that one can obtain small but significant corrections to the classical Turing
conditions, in some sense justifying quasi-static approximations mentioned above. While these
analytical results were only small modifications of the classical conditions (valid for slow growth),
they are significant in showing how growth can modify a system’s ability to undergo Turing-type
instabilities, relaxing some of the restrictions on pattern forming systems. Hetzer & Madzvamuse
[136] considered a type of abstract quasi-asymptotic approach to stability in time-dependent
domains. Klika & Gaffney [137] relaxed some of the assumptions in the previous studies through
the use of Lyapunov stability, demonstrating important aspects of history-dependence in these
non-autonomous systems. It was also shown that for some special kinds of growth functions,
