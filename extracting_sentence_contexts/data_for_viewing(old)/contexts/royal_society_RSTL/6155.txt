prevents the ordinary post-mortem transformation from occurring. Its action, perhaps,
is not quite s0 perfect as that of freezing, but still, especially with the liver of the rabbit,
specimens are easily obtained yielding only the faintest indication of sugar. On testing
the decoction, there is no change on boiling with the blue liquid, but after some time
a few particles of red precipitate may subside. 'The animal is suddenly killed, and a
Piece of the liver as rapidly as is possible removed and thrown into a large quantity of
boiling water. 1t need not remain more than two or three minutes. Pounded in a
mortar with water and boiled, a liquid is furnished on filtration for testing.

It has been noticed by BERSARD, that after division of the spinal cord Just below the
phrenic nerves, the liver is found free from sugar upon being ordinarily examined at the
period of death, whilst it becomes strongly saccharine afterwards. Various Suggestions
have been made in explanation of this phenomenon. The fact itself is a most striking
one, and has frequently been corroborated in my laboratory. It fully agrees with the
experiments I haye been mentioning, and receiyes from them, I consider, a satisfactory

explanation. After the division of the spinal cord, the temperature of the animal rapidly
falls. In one case I noticed in a rabbit 33 hours after the operation, that the tempera-
ture of the rectum was only 67% This low degree of temperature at the time of death
renders the post-mortem production of sugar 80 slow a process, that it is easily recognized
