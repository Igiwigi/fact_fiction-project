In practice, this computational trick leads to the same
result. In a different paper Taylor [20] points out that the
method of Taylor & Frank [22] treats y as if it is causally influ-
enced by x which is not necessarily the case, and in general it
only covaries with x.

9. Trans-generational kin selection games

The fitness effects related individuals can have on each other
need not be confined to one generation. The fitness of an indi-
vidual existing now can be influenced by the actions of
another individual in the past via modifications of the
environment. In fact, the possibility of modification of the
environment is built into the very first causal graph of EGT
we presented (figure 1, right side): the selective mediator s
can represent an environmental factor which is potentially
altered by the focal individual and/or the population at
large via the resident value x*. This viewpoint is emphasized
in particular by the ‘adaptive dynamics’ approach [15,68],
where a separation of evolutionary and ecological timescales
