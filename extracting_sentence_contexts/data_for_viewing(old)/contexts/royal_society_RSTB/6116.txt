connexion. A connexion almost certainly similar was described by Finatorr (1906)
in the pigeon, but was held by him, on grounds which we believe to be untenable, to
represent the ascending process.

The interest of this connexion between the polar cartilage and the pterygoquadrate
lies in the fact that it enables us to identify the basitrabecular process, and to see that
the infrapolar process is not simply a basitrabecular process directed backwards. The
basitrabecular process as such is not further developed in the cartilaginous skull in the
duck ; it is, however, very obvious in the swallow, fig. 22 (b.t.p.), and has been described
by W. K. Parker (1876), T. J. Parker (1892), and Suscukry (1899) in the forms
studied by them.

The recognition of the fact that the infrapolar process is a different structure from
the basitrabecular process solves a problem raised by a comparison between the crocodile
and the bird (DE Brrr, 1926, 6). Infrapolar processes are also present in the crocodile,
and the palatine nerves run on their median side, whereas they run on the lateral side
of the infrapolar processes in birds. Since the infrapolar processes are free down-
growths from the polar cartilage, there is no reason why they should not grow inside
the palatine nerves in one case and outside them in another. Further, it is to be noticed
that in the crocodile the infrapolar processes do not fuse with the basal plate, but end
freely, and it would therefore be possible for the palatine nerves to slip over their free
ends and so assume a median position. The palatine nerves always run ventrally to
the basitrabecular process.
