Bave been covered by the flowing tide ; indeed, we found it to be almost impossible to
‘Secure the required stages at any other time. Our own practice has been to take a
Soat, and to gather and fix the material on the spot, cutting up the receptacles
= the fertile thalli, and dropping the pieces at once into the fixing solution. As the
esult of a lengthy series of trials we found the best material was obtained by using
Qither Flemming’s (strong) or Hermann’s solutions with half the normal amount
of osmic acid. We obtained very good results by making up these fixatives in
50 per cent. sea-water.

When the projecting papilla are about to enter on their first stage of division the
nucleolus is seen to become vacuolated, although it does not disappear till just before
the grouping of the chromosomes in the equatorial plane, at which stage we could
no longer distinguish it. But the fact must not be lost sight of that it loses part
of its contents at a very early period of the karyokinetic process.
