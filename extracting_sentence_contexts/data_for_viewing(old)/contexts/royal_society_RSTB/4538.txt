first traces of the stony layer have also appeared (text-figs. 22, 23). This process of
fragmentation, accompanied by tangential flattening of the strands, ultimately gives
rise to the thin but nearly continuous vascular arc, which, at the level shown in
text-fig. 27, covers the dorsal two-thirds of the cross-section.

The similar are forming the ventral one-third of the vascular ring in the same
figure has originated independently of the dorsal are. In order to trace its mode of
origin, we must again refer to the series of sections in text-figs. 19-27. In text-fig. 20
it will be noticed that there is, besides the large dorsal strands, a group of small
mostly concentric strands on the ventral side of the section. In the small amount of

material examined I could not trace any connection at the chalazal end between the
dorsal and the ventral groups. As this fact was subsequently found to be of some
theoretical importance (see p. 283, below) in the interpretation of the seed of
Acmopyle, it was considered worth while to confirm it by means of paraffin sections
of the basal region of a third seed (in addition to the two sectioned by hand) ; no
trace of a connection was observed. ‘The ventral strands are in two batches, one
inside the inner ring of canals, the other in the space between the two rings. ‘Those
of the inner batch terminate after only a short upward course; those of the outer
batch, on the contrary, increase in number, and, becoming markedly flattened in the
tangential direction, ultimately form the ventral arc seen in text-fig. 27.

Thus, at the level of the figure just referred to, the stone is almost completely
