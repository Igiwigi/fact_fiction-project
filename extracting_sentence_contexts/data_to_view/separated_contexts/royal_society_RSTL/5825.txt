2 'The proximity of the land to the old estuary deposit of the Simeto is indicated by

Zthe tusks and teeth of elephants* found near Paternd, as well as at other places in the

E*'Terra Forte” south of Catania, and frequently in digging the foundations of that city. EBones also of the horse, and of several species of bovine animals, and the teeth and

#Ehorns of stags have been met with in the same places. TI was also informed, that in the

old alluvium of Cefali the molar of a hippopotamus had been found; but I had no

Sopportunity of verifying these facts, or of getting the species determined by competent

= osteologists. A Signor B. Gravixa, in a memoir recently published in the © Bulletin” of the Geological
Society of France (2nd series, tom. xv. p. 391, 1857-58), has recorded the discovery of
a member of this same series of estuarine deposits which is of marine origin.
