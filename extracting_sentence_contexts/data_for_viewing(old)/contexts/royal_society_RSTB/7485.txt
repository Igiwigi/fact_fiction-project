It may be noted that the longer flank of J, always lay on the opposite side of the apex from
the centre of /;, which agrees well with the hypothesis that conditions which inhibit the
formation of a leaf centre promote the extension of the flanks round the apex.

In no. 12, an experiment of group II in which the centres of P,; and of P, were removed,
the asymmetry of /, is particularly significant. In this experiment the genetic spiral was
reversed permanently at the angle /|â€”/, and the asymmetry of J, was also reversed, so that
here again the longer flank of 7, was on the opposite side of the apex from the centre of J,.

The asymmetry of /;, however, is difficult to reconcile with the hypothesis proposed
above which therefore remains for the present only a possibility to be borne in mind.
Since the asymmetry of J; is at present not understood it will not be described here, but
the main facts are recorded in table 3 and in the figures.

Discussion AND CONCLUSIONS

From the experiments on Rhoeo discolor reported above and from observations made on
normal plants, information has been obtained with regard to three main questions. These
questions concern the manner in which a leaf primordium is determined and develops,
the factors locating the position in which a primordium is determined and the causes of
the asymmetry of the primordium. They will now be discussed in turn.

As to the first questicn the evidence indicates that in Rhoeo the centre of a primordium
or a small central region is determined first and that from this centre the flanks extend
round the apex until they meet. For the fact that in Rhoeo the flanks of P, continued to
