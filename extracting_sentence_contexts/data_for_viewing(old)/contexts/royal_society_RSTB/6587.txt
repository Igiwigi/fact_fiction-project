to the rudimentary eyes and later develop into the compound eyes of the imago.

The disappearance of the larval eye in the imago and the development of the
rudimentary eye of the larva into the accessory eye of the imago are not supported
by the work of Zavret (1907) or Kemin (1913, a), who maintain that the larval
eyes persist and become the accessory eyes of the imago.

ZAvREL (1907), who made a comparative study of the eyes in the larvae and pupae
of Diptera, clearly shows in his figures (1, 2, 5, 9, 11, p. 247) that-the larval eyes
(Nebenaugen) persist in the pupa. These larval eyes may be doubled or trebled.

Kemn (1913, a) found that the larval eyes persist in Belgica antarctica and become
the accessory eye of the imago. In fact, he concluded his discussion on the develop-
ment of the accessory eye in Belgica by saying “‘ Je pense que chez tous les insectes
4 métamorphose compléte dont la larve posséde des yeux simples, ces yeux persistent
chez limago. Ils peuvent étre plus ou moins déplacés et masqués par les yeux
imaginaux qui gagnent en surface ”’.

I have never found the rudimentary eyes described by Scumrrz in any of the
Mycetophilid larvae, though in many cases I found the elements of the ommatidia
of the compound eyes (Hauptaugen) in mature larvae, in the form of two conspicuous,
fusiform, pigmented areas on either side of the mid-dorsal line in the prothoracic
segment.

In the pupa the accessory eye (which is the persisting larval eye) is found as a
