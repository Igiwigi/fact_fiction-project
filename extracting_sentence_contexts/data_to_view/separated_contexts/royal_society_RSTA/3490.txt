Ideally, one would wish to use a detector array as the imaging detector; however, until
recently the cumulative noise of such arrays was too high to measure reliably the position of a

single photon within the field of view. One contribution from our groups [12,14,15] has been to 1B
use an intensified camera to do exactly this. By reducing the gate time of the intensifier such that =
the gain is large only for the instant of the photon arrival, it is possible to reduce the number Da
of dark events to far fewer than one dark event per frame.
