.,and the Mode of its Communication. 91

'The discovery of these-extraordinary facts surprised me, and
excited all my, curiosity ;, and I immediately set about investi-
gating their cause.,;.,

As it is well, known; that air a with considerable obsti-
nacy /to' the surfaces of ome. s0lid. bodies, I conceived it to, be
possible, that the, particles of air in immediate contact with-the
surface of the cylindrical vessel, No. 1, might in fact be s0 at-
tached tothe metal as. to adhere to-it with, Some considerable
force; and,if that were- the, case,, as. confined air is known to
constitute a-yery/warm covering,.it appeared to me to'be possible,
that-the cooling of the vessel No,,z, might have been retarded, by
such-an/invisible covering. .of; confined, air;z\ which covering, in
the-experiment with the vessel, No.;2, had, been displaced,:and
ina great measure driven away, by the, colder covering, of linen,
by which the body of the instrament was closely embraced.

conceived, that; the linen must have accelerated the, cooling
of the instrument; either! by: facilitating; the approach. of ;a,suc-
cession of fresh particles of cold air, or by increasing; the effects
