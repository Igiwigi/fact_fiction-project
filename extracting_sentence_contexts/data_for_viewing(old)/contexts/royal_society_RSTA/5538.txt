bursts and K-complexes appeared with a short latency. Our results corroborate these findings
and demonstrate a clear causal connection between the 6 activity in Al-phases and the preceding
sympathetic activation. In 27% and 41%, respectively, of the 350 CAP sequences with at least two


Al-phases, the shift in 6 energy most likely Granger-causes a surge in blood pressure, resulting
in a shorter PAT and a drop in PWA, respectively. Consequently, our findings provide further
evidence that Al-phases are closely linked to an increase in sympathetic activity. However, the
impact on autonomic functioning is less pronounced than for A3-phases.

Additionally, our GC analysis reveals a significant difference in the PWA — £ interaction
during CAP periods with predominantly A3-phases than during non-CAP periods. This could
potentially be a result of the fact that spontaneous arousals show cardiovascular activation prior
to the first signs of arousal in the EEG [51,52]. Such an increase in cardiovascular activity can be
caused by external perturbations as CAP can be triggered by external conditions [17]. On the other
hand, as a high percentage of arousals are preceded by slow waves such as K-complexes [53],
ASDA arousals do not take into account the slow element of the double EEG activation (slow and
rapid) that is typical in NREM sleep [54]. Thus, autonomous activations could be erroneously
allocated before the onset of cortical activation [55] by not considering the pre-arousal slow-wave
component. In our analysis, 22.8% of the CAP sequences with at least two A3-phases contained
an A1-phase prior to an A3-phase, which is remarkably similar to the number of sequences with
significant non-zero GC values for PWA > 8 interactions (24%). Hence, a preceding burst in delta
activity may be the cause of the activation of the autonomic system, which in turn foreshadows a
shift in energy towards higher frequencies in brain activity.
