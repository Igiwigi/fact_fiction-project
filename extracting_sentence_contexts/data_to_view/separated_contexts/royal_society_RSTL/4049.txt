A difference, however, does exist on interposing a lamella of gold or of mica be-
tween the galvanoscopic nerve. and the muscle: these lamelle prevent the induced
contractions without destroying the effect of the discharge of the jar. I am far from
concluding from the above fact that the two phenomena may not have the same
origin. * We have no precise knowledge as to why the discharge of the jar can be
very slight without its ceasing to.
