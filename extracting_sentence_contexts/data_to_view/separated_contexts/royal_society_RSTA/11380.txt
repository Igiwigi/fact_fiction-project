For instance, when
V = 340, the maximum current for the negative leak is somewhere between 12:1
and 0°81 millim., whereas for the positive leak it is at a pressure somewhere near
0°2 millim. Thus for corresponding effects the value of X/p, where X is the electric
intensity and p the pressure, has to be much greater when the positive ions are the
active agents than when the negative ions are. The actual difference between the
effects of the two kinds of ions is diminished owing to the fact that the negative
ions which the original positive ions produce by collisions also act as ionising
agents. Curves resembling some of the above have been obtained previously by
McCiettanpt, who also explained the increase in the current produced by the
electromotive force as being due to the positive ions producing others by collisions.

‘The author has calculated the number of positive ions which reach a surrounding
cylinder when a given number start from a wire of given radius at its centre and
both the positive ions and the negative ions subsequently produced give rise to
others by collision, in the hope that it might be applied to the further elucidation of
the above experimental results. The expression obtained, however, is so complex
that its manipulation, so as to fit the observations, did not seem likely to greatly
advance our knowledge of the subject.
