The numbers set out as expected again refer to expectations on the basis of 5%
recombination. It will be seen that there is no significant discrepancy. No argu-
ment can be based on the observed numbers opposed to the view that crest, equally
with hernia, is linked with pile. The evidence for linkage in this case is weaker,
partly because of the smaller numbers, but principally because the genes concerned
are now in repulsion, instead of, as before, in coupling. It is a fact far too frequently
overlooked that data from F, generations in repulsion give far less information on
linkage than would the same number of observations from a cross in coupling.
The data for crest and colour do, however, provide positive confirmation of our
view, in the entire absence of coloured birds without crest, which with close linkage
should be very rare. Without linkage the expectation in this class is 2-91.

The enlarged material, published in 1930, throws no further light on the linkage
of crest with colour, but clearly confirms the linkage of colour with hernia, and
gives much further information on the incidence of suppression. The new data
for the second generation show 12 males out of 146 as having hernia, which we
may interpret as manifestation in 33% of the birds carrying the necessary genes.
Of the females, there were 39 out of 192, or 81% manifestation.* Heterozygous
