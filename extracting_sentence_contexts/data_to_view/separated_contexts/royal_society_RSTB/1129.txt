The difficulties involved in this series of experiments will be still more evident
when we turn to the influence of the section of only the opposite posterior column
upon the cord effect. C. Section of the Posterior Column of the Opposite Side to the Nerve Excited. In these experiments we are for the first time confronted with the remarkable fact
that in consequence of an intervening section the stimulation of the nerve is some-
times followed by an increased effect. (See also Chapter VITL, Section 9, B., p. 395.) Since the section has cut off at least some channels of communication between the
lower and upper parts of the cord, and presumably, therefore, has blocked the paths
of some, even though few, nerve impulses, such a rise must be attributed to the
greater intensity of the effect evoked in the remaining channels, whether nerve fibres
or nerve cells, and the cord must therefore be considered to be hyperexcitable.
