One of the results of the present inquiry
has been to show that in a range of closely allied forms the vertebrze of the caudal
region differ less than do those of the trunk, and they are more elementary in
structure ; witness, for instance, the series of Rava, shown in fig. 33, p. 388. A series
of Torpedo, Rhinobatus, or Cestracion would illustrate the same fact. It is not a new thesis that the structure of the caudal vertebra of sharks and rays
is simpler than that of the vertebree of the trunk region, K6LLIKER, in 1864, wrote :
“Die vorderen Wirbel von Ginglymostoma sind verwickelter gebaut als die des
Schwanzes” (20, p. 53). And Gapow and Axporr write: “the tail of embryonic
Elasmobranchs generally shows more primitive conditions or stages than the trunk,”
and “as the tail generally shows earlier stages than the trunk, a forward gradation
can be made out in each embryo in passing from the tail towards the head” (6, pp.
