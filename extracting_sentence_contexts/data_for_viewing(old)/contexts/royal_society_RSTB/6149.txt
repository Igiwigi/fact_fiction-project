conception originally put forward by Braun (1854), and later developed by Hartic
(1901), that the transverse walls of initials with right-hand spiral grain always fall
to the left, and of initials with left-hand spiral grain to the right. The proposed
correlation is clear from fig. 16 (d) and (e). The position of the cross wall is supposed

to determine the sign of the micellar spiral. On account of the spiral winding itself
this idea seems to be highly improbable. Fig. 16(d’) and (e’) is a reproduction of the
cells shown in fig. 16(d) and (e), turned through 180° about the axis of the cell so that
the walls previously at the back are now visible. The transverse walls are now seen
not to be parallel to the micellar rows ; in fact, in a cylindrical cell, the cross wall
and the micellar direction could only be parallel at one point, and in a cell of
square cross-section only one tangential wall can have micelles oriented parallel to
the cross wall. It seems fairly certain that no exact correlation can exist between
the micellar spiral and the transverse wall.

This work of Jaccarp and Frey does, however, impose two conditions on the
mechanism of the development of the micellar spiral. Such a mechanism must
be able to produce tracheids with different spiral signs, and must be such that the
variation in ring width causes a corresponding alteration in the inclination of the
micelles. To these we must add the conditions which have been shown to be
necessary during the present investigations. The mechanism must explain how
the law L = K cot 0 (or L = KB cot 6) comes about for tracheids and must enable
