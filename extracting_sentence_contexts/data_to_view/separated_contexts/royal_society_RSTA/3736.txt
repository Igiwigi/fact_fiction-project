to XI. If we consider the temperature constant, we obtain for the variation of emissivity

with pressure :t
E = ap* + bpâ€™,

and we have seen that the exponents of p are different for every gas studied. It is
not easy to reconcile this fact with the theory that conductivity, viscosity, and
specific heat are all three independent of pressure. It must be remembered,
however, that the theory is deduced on the assumptions that the molecular paths
are straight lines, that the radius of the molecular sphere of action is very small
compared with the mean free path, and that the cohesion of the gas is a negligible
quantity. Neither of these hypotheses seems altogether justifiable at pressures of one or two
hundred atmospheres.
