a few in which the nuclei are in smaller number—six or less. In these, the nuclei
sometimes, probably always, do not fuse. These may occur anywhere in the sterile
part of the sac, and one or more of them is not uncommonly found close to or at the
antipodal end (figs. 38, A, B; 89H). Except for their position these compartments
differ in no respect from those of the fertile end of the sac, and it is therefore
not surprising that they should behave in a similar manner. The compartment
enlarges at the expense of the surrounding cells and vacuoles appear in the
cytoplasm. Its wall usually grows upwards, outwards, or downwards, as a tube
which eventually penetrates the nucellus like the normal embryo-sac-tube (fig. 89H ;
text-fig.). Sometimes when it is deeply immersed in the endosperm its growth is
equal in all directions, and thus no tube, but merely an enlarged cell, is produced
(fig. 38n).* When a tube is formed, the free nuclei and cytoplasm move into it
in precisely the same way as in the normal embryo-sac-tube—it is, in fact, an embryo-
sac-tube remarkable only for its deep-seated origin. In some cones almost every ovule
shows one or more of these abnormally situated tubes; in others they occur in very
few. The endosperm-cells lying near them are frequently bi-nucleate, probably as a
result of amitotic division. It has not been possible to prove that the nuclei of any
of these tubes become fertilised, but their history, behaviour, and appearance leave no
room for doubt that they are functionally sexual.

One unpollinated ovule has been found in which no nuclear fusion has occurred, but
all the compartments behave like those of the micropylar end of a normal sac ;
nearly all have produced upgrowing tubes into which their cytoplasm and free nuclei
have moved ; a few have not formed tubes, but are clearly quite similar to the rest,
and are either less advanced in development or have been depleted by their more
