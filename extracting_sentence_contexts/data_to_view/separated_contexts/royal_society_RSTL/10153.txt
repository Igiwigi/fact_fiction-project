In all the seeds nearly related to Calamus the structure is very typical (Plate 69,
fig. 24). I have already noticed the great development of the middle lamella in these
endosperms. Another interesting fact is, thab in Calamus and Metroxylon a well-
marked cubical crystal is present, imbedded in the wall of each cell. It seems as if
there had been a period in the life of the cell when the protoplasm had required to
get rid of some of the calcium oxalate resulting from the metabolic activity of the
protoplasm. This was consequently thrown down in the form of a crystal which
adhered to the cell wall, and in the subsequent thickening which occurred, was
gradually covered in until it was at length s8urrounded on all sides by the cellulose.
