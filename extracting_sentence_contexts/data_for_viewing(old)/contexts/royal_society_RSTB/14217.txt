Spearman rank correlations can be used if at least monotoni-
city is achieved. Instead, non-parametric tools can be used
whether or not these assumptions above are fulfilled. Also
note that many studies have investigated the problem of
inferring missing and spurious interactions in the area of net-
work science [46,47], whose parametric tools can be

potentially extended to infer cause-effect relationships in eco-
logical communities. As an example, the non-parametric
causal inference approach presented here can help to dis-
tinguish whether a positive interaction between two species
is either due to a mutualistic effect or indirectly due to the
fact that both species respond similarly to an external
environmental factor. By taking this perspective across all
potential sets of interactions, we can be ready to distinguish
which specific interactions among species drive the dynamics
of entire pollinator communities. Yet, it is worth emphasizing
that ultimate confidence in the use of causal inference is
entirely dependent on our confidence in the proposed
causal hypothesis, unless we also have independent exper-
imental evidence after performing such causal interventions
that show an agreement with our predictions.
