composition could be determined. This method was not altogether satisfactory

owing to impurities in the carbon rods and the consequent uncertainty of some of

the observed lines being due to constituents of the aerolite or to impurities in the
carbon. I therefore tried other means.

The aerolite was finely powdered and mixed with a metallic powder, the composition
of which was known. The mixture was strongly compressed in a hydraulic press,
and from the solid mass thus obtained a pair of poles were fashioned.

Tron was one of the first metals used for experiment, but was discarded owing to
the fact that iron is a plentiful constituent of stony meteorites. Silver was finally
chosen because of the comparative ease of getting it pureâ€”also because the lines in
any part of its are spectrum are few in comparison with the lines of iron which are

exceedingly numerous all along the spectrum. Moreover, the softness of silver
makes it easy to get strongly coherent poles from its mixture with the aerolite.
The silver powder I used was specially prepared by a method given to me by
Dr. A. Scorr, F.R.S. The purest commercial silver was dissolved in nitric acid, the
solution evaporated to dryness in a silica crucible, and the solid residue fused till any
