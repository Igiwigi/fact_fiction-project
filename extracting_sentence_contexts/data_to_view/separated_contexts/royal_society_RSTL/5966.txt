188 MR. MACQUORN RANKINE ON THE THERMO-DYNAMIC THEORY

They may therefore be applied with confidence to engines working within those limits,
and probably somewhat above them ; but for pressures much exceeding 120 lbs. on the
square inch, and ratios of expansion exceeding 16, it is advisable for the present to use

the exact, formulte. : 'The foundation of the approximate formulz for work, and for mean effective pressure,

is the fact, that for pressures not exceeding 120 Ibs. on the square inch, or 17280 Ibs,
on the square foot, the equation of the curve CDG is very nearly
This equation is very convenient in calculation, because the sixteenth root can be

extracted, with great rapidity, to a degree of accuracy sufficient for practical purposes,
by the aid of a table of squares alone; and by a little additional labour, without any

tables whatsoever. Let 7, as before, be the ratio of expansion ; then evidently,
