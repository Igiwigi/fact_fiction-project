* I have in a former paper stated that the perpendicular shoots of the vine form an
exception. I spoke on the authority of numerous experiments ; but they had been
made late in the summer; and on repeating the same experiments at an earlier period,
I fqund the result in conformity with my experiments on other trees,


the true Sap of Trees is deposited during Winter, 10g

but as the subject of the Paper, which I have now the honour
to address to you, appeared to be of more importance, I have
deferred those observations to a future opportunity ; and I shall
at presentonly observe, that I conceive myself to be in possession
of facts to prove that both buds and roots originate from the
alburnous substance of plants, and not, as is, I believe, generally
supposed, from the bark.

I am, &c.
