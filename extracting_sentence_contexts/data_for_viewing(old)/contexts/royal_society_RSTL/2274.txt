in all of which tar, assa foetida, camphor, oil of rhodium,
musk, or some other powerful odour is the most important
ingredient.

These facts strikingly coincide with the mode in which the
alligators take their prey, as far as the observations I had an
opportunity of making on those in my possession enable me
to judge. This is done by suddenly snapping at it sideways,
a mode perfectly consistent with the form of the mouth and
