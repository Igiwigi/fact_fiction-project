traction or enlargement of the pupil is not of itself sufficient
to produce distinct vision at different distances, viz. that the
myopes, whose pupil contracts and dilates as in other eyes,
are $till unable to adapt the eye to different distances; and the
means by which this is remedied certainly does not consist in

a larger or smaller aperture for the rays to pass through, but a
power of altering their direction, which the change in the
shape of the eye had rendered too convergent. The same
fact is also observable in those who $squint ; the pupil in both
eyes equally contracts and dilates, but still the vision of one
eye is less perfect than the other. Another principle upon
which it has been attempted to explain this power of the eye,
is a supposed change in the convexity of the crystalline lens ;
the ancients had some obscure notion of it, but it has been
lately pursued by Mr. THomas YoUNG, in a paper published
in the Philosophical Transactions of London for 179g. He
has endeavoured to demonstrate the existence of muscles in
the crystalline lens, and by their action to account for distinct
vision at different distances. This opinion deserves here the
more particular examination, having met the attention of the *
Royal Society, and thereby likely to influence the general
