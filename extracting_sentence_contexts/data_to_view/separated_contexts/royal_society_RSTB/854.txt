The question of the origin of the
pigment in the epidermis will be considered subsequently. Pigment in the
epidermis occurs also in the Dab (P. limanda) but much less abundantly. Particles
of black pigment are occasionally seen in the epidermis of other Fishes when sections
are examined, but we have met with no case in which the abundance of epidermic
pigment is as great as in the Flounder, and in no ease is the pigment in this layer of
any importance as a factor in the visible coloration, although its presence is an
important fact in relation to the physiological history of the pigment in Fish and in
higher Vertebrates. Of the relation of the “coloured” pigments to connective tissue cells or to other —
ultimate element of the dermal tissue, we can say still Jess. In some cases, as for
instance the Whiting, there are yellow chromatophores having a radiate dendritic
structure and as definite an outline as the black chromatophores.
