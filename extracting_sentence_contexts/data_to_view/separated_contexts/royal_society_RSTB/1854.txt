In all states of nerve the usual effect of prolonged tetanisation is an augmenta-
tion of the negative mobility (augmented S in the Ist and 2nd states, figs, 29, 85;
diminished N and reversal from N to § in the 8rd state, figs, 30, 32); the exceptional
effect of tetanisation is a diminution of the negative mobility (diminished S in the
2nd state, fig. 37 ; increased N in the 8rd state, fig. 36). Expressed in terms of electrotonic changes K and A, the same series of facts may
be clothed in the following statements, involving less assumption, but also offering
less explanation :—

1. In fresh nerve (1st state) the sum of propagated katelectrotonic effects exceeds
the sum of propagated anelectrotonic effects—K > A. Therefore, negative deflection
during tetanisation.
