The word ‘bold’ refers to the fact that we use bold type. These bold operator tensors will allow a
more compact treatment of the physics of circuits than the operator tensor formulation.

An operation corresponds to a use of an apparatus in the laboratory. To perform an
experiment, we need to wire such operations together into a circuit. Each operation has
some outcome (or set of outcomes) associated with it. This might correspond to a particular
light flashing. A bold operation corresponds to a set of operations associated with the same
apparatus use.

We will define the notion of an outcome-complete physical bold operator as a natural
mathematical object to associate with outcome-complete bold operations. With appropriate
definitions in place we are able to provide the following axiom for quantum theory.
