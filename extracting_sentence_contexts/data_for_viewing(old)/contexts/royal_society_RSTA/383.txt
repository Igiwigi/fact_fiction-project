period of 1980-1999 used in IPCC [43]. Mean global temperatures for 1980-1999
are warmer than for 1961-1990 by 0.16°C and may mean larger changes in both
run-off and water stress for some river basins. However, if a pre-industrializec
value of 1861-1890 is used, the difference is about 0.31°C cooler, with changes in
future run-off and water stress smaller in some river basins than those presentec
in our analysis.

MacPDM has been run offline and therefore any feedbacks into the climate
system have not been included. It has also not been calibrated and_ its
yarametrizations have not been explored, although previous studies on smal
river catchments [44,45] find that climate model uncertainty is greater than
rydrological modelling uncertainty. In fact, we have found that as we move from
he PPE model data (temperature and precipitation) to MacPDM output (run-
off), the spatial correlation appears to increase pointing to the importance o
he model input parameters, such as soil type and land cover, in controlling
he resulting run-off, which may themselves change in the future owing to
direct impacts of climate change, adaptation responses and COz effects on plan’
water-use efficiency.

The calculation of PE is included within MacPDM and is based on the
Penman-Monteith equation; as shown in recent studies [46,47], this coulc
ye another source of uncertainty. This issue may need to be explored in
future studies to determine the sensitivity of the CPDN ensemble to the PE
calculations.
