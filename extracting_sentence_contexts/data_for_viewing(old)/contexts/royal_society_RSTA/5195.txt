past decades. In particular, the notion of naturalness is currently under a certain tension owing to
the low mass of the H-particle, and the fact that we have not found any unknown states around a
TeV in mass.3

In this article, we make a number of remarks concerning the origin of mass in the standard
model and its connection with the theory of superconductivity. The presentation is informal.

2. Generalities on symmetries

It is far from simple to explain spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) in the SM, the BEH
mechanism. We are making statements about the properties of the ground state of the universe,
the vacuum, a quantum state. The mechanism is fundamentally a quantum phenomenon, so
often classical metaphors may be misleading. Nature offers an excellent one which has been
extraordinarily fertile in the interplay between condensed matter and particle physics. : =
