However only further investigation taken to lower temperatures could help
definitively establish the correct behaviour. In summary, although ABS have been predicted as an intrinsic component of SF point contacts,
there has only been one direct observation of such an ABS [50]. Partly this can be attributable to
the fact that it is difficult to make one, well defined contact that satisfies the conditions needed
to observe clearly defined ABS features [33]. Nonetheless, their presence in the spectra should be
revealed by the temperature dependence of the zero bias conductance which will approach zero
at OK for a half metallic contact [20]. Measurements of the temperature dependence of Go(T)
however have so far proved inconclusive as it is necessary to measure the contacts down to


very low temperature and, probably to use planar contacts to do so.
