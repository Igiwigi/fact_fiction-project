And of course there are other cases
in which even the strongest stimulation of such an insular area as 9b f would fail to
elicit any thing further than a local contraction of that area. (4) From all this, then, we see that exploration by graduated stimuli reveals, first,
differences in the degrees of excitability of closely contiguous tissue-areas, and, second,
differences in the degrees of permeability to stimuli on the part of sach areas—there
being thus tissne-areas which admit of being more or less physiologically isolated from
the rest of the tissue-mass by section. And the fact that in all these cases the lines of
demarcation between the differentiated tissue-tracts are 80 sharply defined constitates, I
think, an additional support to the hypothesis concerning the presence of nerves, or

(B) Ercitational Continuity.—(a) Closely related to this hypothesis are also the

* Tt has heen s8uggested to me that contractile waves are merely muscle-wayes, and that their blockage in
contractile strips is due to shock.
