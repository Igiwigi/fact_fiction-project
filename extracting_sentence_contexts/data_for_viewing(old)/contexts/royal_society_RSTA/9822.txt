disintegration and re-aggregation has proceeded further, and, in addition, there is
some uncertainty about A, = 87d, adopted.

RunGE and Precut’s plates were only sensitive up to 6500 A.U., and Exner and
FLASHEK give only two lines above this, 6642°73 and 6641°38, both of which belong
to the F cycle. The number of lines, however, coming within this cycle is very large,
but a complete discussion would involve the consideration of the new kinds of
relationships referred to under barium, and cannot therefore be undertaken here. It
will be sufficient to deal only with some generalities, specially bearing on the series
proper, which will also give some further light on the general D series.

There are a large number of triplets with separations in the neighbourhood of 692
and 482, which are roughly in the proper ratio 5: 3, allowing for the fact that the
actual separations must be larger. Those in the table of F lines above are roughly
parallel to the BaF, and give a limit somewhere about 24520. VD,,(2) would
therefore be about this, and VD,,;(2) more than 692+4382 = 1124 larger. The
denominator of VD,;(2) should be a multiple of A,. Using the most probable value
of A, = 376,, it is found that the denominator comes out very close to a multiple of
314, If this be made exact it is found that VD,;(2) = F,(%) = 2575275. The
value of F,() is then taken 25752°75+€ The values of 3 are so large that there
can be no ambiguity about the multiples to be chosen to give the separations, viz.,
163, 103. These multiples march well with those for Ca, Sr, Ba. The separations
resulting are 705°93, 456°69, with F, (0) = 24590°13 and F,(o) = 2529606. If we
apply the rule shown in the preceding elements for F,;,(2), the denominator is
2°937300—2A, = 2°868676. Satellites depending on 30, 2d would give separations
