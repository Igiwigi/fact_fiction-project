Once again we obtain a contradiction except in the extreme case of a black hole whose net infallen
matter contains virtually as much entropy as the entire black hole’s original entropy Su. a

Theorem 1.1 generalized. It is simple enough to repeat the above reasoning for theorem 1.1, where
we no longer make use of locality. In this case, we may still use figure 4 provided we ignore the
no-communication decomposition structure. In particular, strong subadditivity yields

I(R’ : R) < I(B’,N',R': R) = (B,N,1:R) =I(B,N: R). (A 15)

Here, we use the fact that joint subsystems (B’, N’, R’) and (B, N, I) are unitarily related. Again, the
most natural assumption is that the infallen matter I is independent of the quantum state of the
black hole, (B, N), or its early epoch radiation R.
Applying equation (A13) to any PT then tells us that for a unitarily and completely
evaporating black hole
1(B,N:R) > (1 —)SpH — Smatterr € <1. (A 16)

To simplify our argument, we shall suppose that the infallen matter (Jearly,[) has actually
entered the black hole. In that case, for any times prior to the initial PT, the infallen matter’s
external reference qunats are maximally entangled with some subsystem of the black hole
interior [3]. We shall label the orthogonal complement of this subsystem within B as B+. It is
clear that: (i) (B+, N, R) can be treated as a pure quantum state; and (ii) I(B, N: R) = 1(B+,N:R).So
