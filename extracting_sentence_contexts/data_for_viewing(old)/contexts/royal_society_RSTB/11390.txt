designed to modify the core cognitive deficit in numerosity processing ident-
ified by individual differences in behaviour, and in neural markers, where
tested. If the intervention is effective, then there will be changes in
Neural structure or functioning, as well as in numerical behaviour, where
both are important measures of the effectiveness of the intervention in ame-
liorating the core deficit. This programme is iterative, with feedback from
changes in brain and behaviour modifying the design of the intervention

learning the foundational concepts and principles of the
structural properties of numbers, such as the commutativity
of addition and the relationship between addition and sub-
traction. It is not sufficient to learn a list of arithmetical facts.

These activities are targeted specifically at the core deficit
identified in the neuroscience, and the constructionist peda-
gogy gives dyscalculics more of the relevant practice they
need to strengthen the mental representation of numerosities,
the relationship among numerosities, and their relationship
to the familiar words and numerals. This is comparable to
the way that dyslexics benefit from training targeted at
their core deficit in phonological processing [117-120] and
its relationship to letters and words [121]. The research
programme we advocate is summarized in figure 10.
