Let us examine the nature of this assemblage. As the points continue to be scattered
Rt random over the plane, their density tends to become uniform. Tt is evident, in fact,
Gthat a random point is as likely to be in any element dS of the surface, as in any equal
Slement dS'; and therefore by continuing to multiply points, the number in dS will be
Zequal (or 8begual, to use a term of Professxor DE MoRGAN's) to that in dS'. Of course,
Shough the density tends to become uniform, the disposition of the points does not tend
=o become symmetrical; those within any element dS will be dispersed in the most
S.regular manner over that elementf. However, it is important to remark that, for a//
-Spurposes of caleulation, the ultimate disposition may be supposed symmetrical ; for as
She position of any point is determined by that of the element dS, within which it falls,
H matters not what arbitrary arrangement we assume for the points within the element.
