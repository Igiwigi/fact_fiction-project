The
paralysis consists in the loss of yoluntary motion ; the movements of the anen-
cephalous foetus result from the agency of the reflex function of the medulla
spinalis. Le6aLLos' error was that of mistaking the phenomena of the reflex
function for sensation and voluntary motion ; and his difficulty naturally arose
out of this error. There is no real discrepancy between the two orders of facts
to which LecarLos refers. The same facts enable us to understand how a perfect action of the sphincters
is compatible with paralysis of the limbs from disease of the cerebrum, and even
of the higher parts of the medulla spinalis; whilst paralysis of the sphincters is
usually conjoined with paralysis of the limbs, arising from disease of the lower
part of the spinal marrow. The first intercepts the principle of voluntary mo-
tion; the second affects the very seat of the reflex function which presides over
the action of the sphincters.
