the nodal curve of the torse. ‘The latter is not a solution of the differential equations.
Example II. A Bitangential Congruency.  (§§ 22-26.)

§ 22. Take for another example the equations

(A+Bp2+Op2) {B (y—p.2)! + C (vo—pyt)?— 13 = {Bey (y— Pe) + Cpa (yo— Pa)
(at+bp,+epe) {b (ype) +e (ys— pase)? —1 5 = (bp, (yi— Pe) +P (Ya Ps) *.

These define y, — p,x, and y, — pw as functions of p, and ps, and are, therefore,
the Clairaut form, and may be integrated by substituting ¢, for p, and ¢, for py,

The integral in this form will represent four lines of a congruency, which co
in fact of all the common tangents to the two quadrie surfaces

Ax’ + By? + Cy,? = 1,
ax? + by? + eye = 1.

The first of the differential equations may be written
(A + Bp, + Op,') (Aa® + By,? + Cy? — 1) = (Aa + By,p, + Cyops)’.
One of the integrals is, therefore,
a (A + Be? + Ce,*) (Av + By,? + Cy? — 1) = (Aa + By,e, + Cysey)®.
< Thus, one of the equations that give the singular solutions is
