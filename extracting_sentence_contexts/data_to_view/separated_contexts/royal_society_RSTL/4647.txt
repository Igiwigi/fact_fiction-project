I had the advantage at times of carrying on my observations in
the six years, at a mean elevation of 1800 feet, simultaneously with observations
made in Bombay at the level of the sea, and at Mahabuleshwur at 4500 feet above
the ea, These simultaneous observations for limited periods led me to remark, that
the amount or range of the diurnal oscillation between the maximum and minimum
hours did not correspond at the different elevations. At the level of the sea in
Bombay the range between 9—10 a.m. and 4—5 e.., appeared generally to be less
than the range between the same hours in Dukhun (Deccan) at 1800 feet above the
8ea; but at Mahabuleshwur, at 4500 feet, the range was constantly less than in
Bombay or on the plateau of the Deccan. Not having had further means of pro-
secuting inquiry into the fact, it was with much interest I remarked that the orders
of the Court of Directors of the East India Company had been carried out by the
astronomer at Madras, and meteorological observations taken for a whole year at a
MDCCCL. 2Q

greater elevation above the sea-level, than had eyer been attempted before in India. Observations 80 made were peculiarly acceptable to me, as they would subject the
accuracy of my own observations to an additional test, and would supply the means
of investigating the supposed diminished diurnal oscillation of the barometer in rela-
tion to elevation above the sea.
