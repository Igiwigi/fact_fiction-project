It was shown that, in a confocal
microscope, misaligning the confocal pinhole results in an improvement in spatial resolution
[29]. As the detector element is moved away from the optical axis, the width of the PSF becomes
narrower, the peak of the PSF becomes weaker, the sidelobe level increases, and the peak of the
PSF moves laterally. These effects explain the fact that ISM gives better resolution than a confocal
microscope. Image formation in confocal fluorescence microscopy was analysed, and improved
resolution predicted [30]. A confocal microscope with computer control, image acquisition and
processing was developed [31].
