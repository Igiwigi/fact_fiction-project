genus has the orbits in the middle of its length. CrepNur’s skulls have theirs far
back, so that the distance between the orbit and the otie notch is small.


EVOLUTION, AND ORIGIN OF THE AMPHIBIA. 5

The shoulder girdle described by v. Ammon as belonging to the type species of
Sclerocephalus has a large rhomboidal interclavicle and very wide triangular clavicles.
CrepNer’s animal has a small interclavicle and narrow clavicles. As CREDNER’S
skulls do not seem to belong toany genus described from adequate material I propose
to resuscitate Gerntrz’s Onchiodon for them.

Onchiodon is of much interest in that it is very near to, in fact scarcely
generically distinct from, Eryops. From the fact that the majority of the specimens
from the Plauenseh-grund are those of aquatic animals, it is probable that the
Onchiodon remains are those of young individuals’ still largely water-living, whilst
Eryops is mostly known from the mainly terrestrial adults.

The only difference in the dorsal surface of the skull is that in Eryops there is an
interfrontal which is absent in Onchiodon. The pterygoid and ectopterygoid
figured by CREDNER agree exactly with Eryops in most features, including the
granular teeth on the former bone, but differ in the shorter length of the post-
basipterygoid region, which is crushed out flat, and therefore at first sight differs
much from that of Eryops known from uncrushed material.
