How can communication work, in contexts like this? First, it seems crucial that A and B have
a common understanding that A is trying to help B by providing some useful information (for
example, B needs to establish that A is trying to communicate with her, rather than the person
behind or next to her). It seems they need a common understanding, too, of the fact that B has just
arrived and will be looking to register for the conference (and, among other things, get a name

badge). By drawing attention to her own name badge, A is putting it into common knowledge : =
between A and B that she has already registered, and hence, by implication, that she knows where : =
the registration desk is. It is assumed to be common knowledge between A and B, too, that the : Pa
location of the registration desk is not known to B (after all, the room is crowded).
