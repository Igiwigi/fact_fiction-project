To integrate the equation for V we assume
V=06,
where © is a function of 0 only, and $ a function of «, B...y (without 0), such that
Vo=zo,

z being a function of 9 only. Assuming that this is possible, the remaining equation to
be satisfied is obyiously

and it can be shown next that there is a solution of the form
