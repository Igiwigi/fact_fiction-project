I have analyzed, by the peroxide of copper, the citrate,
tartrate, and oxalate of lead ; and on comparing the results
thus obtained, with those derived from the analysis of the
crystalline acids, I have come to the above determinations,

Ferroprussic acid, the ferrocyanic acid of the French che-
mists, has proved, hitherto, a stumbling block to me, in re-
ducing the results of my experiments to the atomic theory. I
have subjected it to very numerous trials in many states of
combination, and have sought, with great pains, to-accommo-
date the results to the doctrine‚Äù of prime equivalents; but
hitherto without success. The following facts, however, may
perhaps be deemed of some consequence.

In the first place, the prime equivalent of the crystallized
ferroprussiate of potash is 13-125, compared to oxide of -lead

14, and/to-nitrate' of the same metal--20.75 ; that is, 13.125
of the former salt neutralize 20.75 of the latter. In the se-
cond place, 14 parts of oxide of lead; yield 21. parts of dry
ferroprussiate of lead; or the atomic weight of dry ferro-
