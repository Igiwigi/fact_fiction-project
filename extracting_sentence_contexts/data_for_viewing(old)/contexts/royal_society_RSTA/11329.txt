can, by birational transformation, be represented on a Riemann surface with only
simple branch-points. A method is given for the division of the ¢-plane into
polygons, corresponding to a group generated by real substitutions of period two,
whose double points are not on the real axis; and the genus of the group is found.
The group is of the kind called by Porncart Fuchsian ; the polygons into which the
plane is divided are simply-connected, and cover completely the half of the ¢-plane
which is above the real axis. Results are deduced relating to the possibility of
uniformising any algebraic functions by automorphic functions of such groups, and
the analytical connexion of the uniformising variable with the variables of the form.

In § 2, certain properties of substitutions of period two are found, which are of use
later. These substitutions are for brevity termed “ self-inverse ” substitutions, owing
to the fact that they ave the same as their inverse substitutions.

In § 3,a method is given for carrying out the division of the plane into polygons,
corresponding to a group generated by a given set of self-inverse substitutions. It is
proved that the genus of the group is zero, although the group has sub-groups whose
genus is greater than zero.

In § 4, the automorphic functions of the group are introduced. Since the group is
of genus zero, these automorphic functions are all rational algebraic functions of one
of them ; the conformal representation of the polygons in the ¢-plane on the plane of
this variable is considered. It is shown that the functions which have been obtained
solve the following problem of conformal representation :—Draw from any point P;
in the plane of a variable z, lines (not necessarily straight) to any other points
