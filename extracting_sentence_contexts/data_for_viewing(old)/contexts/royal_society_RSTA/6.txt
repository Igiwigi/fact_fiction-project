A standard representation theorem for functionals, which are continuous relative to the C!-
topology, results in the existence of a stress object that may be as irregular as a measure. (See, for
example, [11] for a concrete situation where irregularities that require the modelling of stresses
by measures may occur.) The representing mathematical object is identified with a stress because


the representation procedure implies the following. The evaluation of the stress object on the
derivative of the generalized velocity, as represented by the jet of the corresponding vector field,
is equal to the power of the force functionalâ€”a generalization of the principle of virtual work
in continuum mechanics. Just as one would expect, without any constitutive information, a force
does not determine a unique representing stress. On the other hand, it is emphasized that the
significance of the representation of forces by measures stems from the fact that measures are the
most irregular objects that may be naturally restricted to sub-bodies of the body. As such, a stress
induces a force system in the body.

In spite of the advantages of the Lagrangian point of view, the notion of a material point,
which is conserved in all configurations of a body, is not general enough (e.g. [15]). It is not
clear what would be the meaning of material points for the continuum description of growing
bodies or chemically reacting mixtures. Thus, instead of modelling virtual velocities as vector :
fields associated with the motion of material points, one may consider flux fields of some =
extensive property in space. (See [16] for the discussion of the kinematics in this case.) Thus, 3
similarly to classical field theories, as in the physics terminology, the body manifold is no
longer used. To model generalized velocities, instead of tangent vector fields over the body nee)
manifold, one considers the sections of some general vector bundle over the space manifold.
