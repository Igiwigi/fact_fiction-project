Tux Committee appointed by the Royal Society to direct the pub-
lication of the Philosophical Transactions, take this opportunity to
acquaint the Public, that it fully appears, as well from the council-
books and journals of the Society, as from repeated declarations which
have been made in several former Transactions, that the printing of
them was always, from time to time, the single act of the respective
Secretaries, till the Forty-seventh Volume : the Society, as a Body,
never interesting themselvyes any further in their publication, than by
occasionally recommending the revival of them to some of their Se-
cretaries, when, from the particular circumstances of their affairs, the
Transactions had happened for any length of time to be intermitted. And this seems principally to have been done with a view to satisfy
the Public, that their usual meetings were then continued, for the im-
provement of knowledge, and benefit of mankind, the great ends of
their first institution by the Royal Charters, and which they have ever
since steadily pursued,

But the Society being of late years greatly enlarged, and their com-
munications more numerous, it was thought advisable, that a Com-
mittee of their members should be appointed to reconsider the papers
read before them, and elect out of them such as they should judge
most proper for publication in the future Transactions; which was
accordingly done upon the 26th of March, 1752. And the grounds

of their choice are, and will continue to he, the importance and sin-
gularity of the subjects, or the adyantageous manner of treating them ;
without pretending to answer for the certainty of the facts, or pro-
priety of the reasonings, contained in the several papers so published,
which must till rest on the credit or judgment of their respective
authors. It is likewise necessary on this occasion to remark, that it is an esta-
blished rule of the Society, to which they will always adhere, never to
give their opinion, as a Body, upon any subject, either of Nature or
Art, that comes before them. And therefore the thanks, which are
frequently proposed from the Chair to be given to the authors of such
papers as are read at their accustomed meetings, or to the persons through
whose hands they receive them, are to be considered in no other light
than as a matter of civility, in return for the respect shewn to the So-
ciety by those communications.
