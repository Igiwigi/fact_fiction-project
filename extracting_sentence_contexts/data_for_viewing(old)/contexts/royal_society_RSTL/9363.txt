be compared with the edge of the atmospheric band, not with its middle, I am inclined
to think that the two may prove identical. It appeared to me sometimes, it is true,


DR. A. SCHUSTER ON THE SPECTRA OF METALLOTDS. 53

that the line of the compound spectrum is more refrangible even than the edge of
the atmospheric band, but I am not quite certain of this. I have left out therefore for
the present the line from the list of the elementary line spectrum of oxygen.

In a letter to * Nature ' (Dec. 20, 1877) I have drawn attention to the fact that
the lower temperature spectrum of oxygen seems to be reversed in the swn, and I
have tried to bring this fact into connexion with the statement made by Professor
DRAPER, that the higher temperature lines of oxygen appear bright on the solar disc.
T have now nothing to add to what I have stated in my letter to © Nature,” and only
give the lis of the exact wave-lengths of the compound line spectrum, together with
the wave-lengths of the nearest solar lines.
