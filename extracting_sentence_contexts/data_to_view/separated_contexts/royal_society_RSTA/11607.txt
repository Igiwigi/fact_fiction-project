The plane etched by aqua regia had not been
repolished after the previous etching by sulphuric acid. It looks as if a film of foreign substance
was interposed between two neighbouring grains, but, on looking at it closer, it is evident that the
traces of this film join those of one of the grains, and it is not possible to admit a doubt that we have
merely to deal with the structure of pure gold. ;

} By the expression “ thickness of a joint,” we understand, in the case of the crystalline joints, the
sum of the joint properly so-called, and of the crystalline border, which it is usually impossible to
separate from it. We have, in fact, measured in all cases the thickness of the dark line. It must not
be forgotten that it is a question of the apparent dimensions, which are much exaggerated by the
etching.
