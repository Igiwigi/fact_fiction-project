the first of the snrface equations (46), multiplying it by (:) f attending to the degree of

each term, and taking adyantage of the principle that, if be any homogeneous function
of x, y, 2, of degree t, the function of angular coordinates, or of the ratios #:y: 2,
which it becomes at the spherical surface 9=0, is the same as (* 4þ for any value of 7,

taking into account equations (38) and (39), and taking advantage of the equation
