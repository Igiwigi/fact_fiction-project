Thus, for t < fy, the state of the photon-system combination in our model is

3(X =x, — t+ HYayy(Y) + bys”),

where X, Y are the position coordinates for the photon and system, respectively.
For ft; <t < fy, the state is

3(X = x1 FE Hay) + (XK — a1 — + HOY).
For t > tz, the state is
8(X = xy + t= Yay” (Y)) + 8(X = xp + F= ty)(bY”*"().

The possible outcomes of a (fictitious) stress-energy measurement at a late time t = T > fp are
thus either finding the photon heading along the first ray X =x) + t) — f and the system localized
in the support of yw, or finding the photon heading along the second ray X = x2 + f2 — tand the
system localized in the support of Ws.

Suppose, for example, we consider a real world defined by the first outcome. Our rules for
constructing the system's beables imply that, for t < 2t; — f2, and for x = x1 or x2, we condition on
none of these outcomes, as all of them correspond to observations within the future light cone. Up
to this time, then, the mass density beables for the system are distributed according to weys(yy/?,
with a proportion |al* localized around Y = x; anda proportion |b|? localized around Y = x.

For 2t — tg <t < ty, the observation of the photon on the first ray is outside the future light
cone of the component of the system localized at xz, but not outside the future light cone of the
