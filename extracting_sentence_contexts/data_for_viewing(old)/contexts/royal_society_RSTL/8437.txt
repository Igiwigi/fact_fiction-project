which flows through the town into the harbour has a course only of 24 miles. The
first part is over Devonian slates and grits; at Brixham it passes through a belt of
limestone about a mile wide, and which, running parallel with the coast, terminates at
Berry Head. To the north of the town is Furzeham Hill, 177 feet high. To the south,
Windmill Hill (on the north-western angle of which the cave is situated) and Heath
Hill rise respectively to the height,of 175 and 190 feet ; while to the westward, Parkham
Fjll is 164 feet above the level of the mean tide (Ordnance Survey maps). A small
zAluent passes between Windmill and Parkham Hills. The watershed between Brixham
ey and that of the Dart rises to the height of from 400 to 550 feet.
Mr. PEXGELLY states that © Windmill Hill is entirely composed of impure thin-bedded,
Feaved and jointed limestone belonging to the Devonian system,” —one set of joints
hEving a © prevalent direction of N. 82? E. to S. 82 W., and the second running nearly
maenetic north and south. In fact they have the bearings of the Brixham valleys.” The
pkimes of the first underlie or dip southward, whilst those of the second are approxi-
mately vertical. The stratification and cleavage-planes intersect at an angle of about
f, and with the joints cause the rock to break readily into pieces of small dimensions.
dip of the strata is about 38* north, 10* east, magnetic.
»* Devonian slates, frequently traversed by thick yeins of quartz, are largely developed
:Sand sonth of Mudstone Bay ; and a considerable mass of greenstone occurs at Shark-
igm Point, the headland south of Berry Head *.
S*© Deposits of iron-ore occur in various parts of the district. That at Sharkham Point
he red or anhydrous hematite, whilst that found elsewhere is the brown or hydrous
variety. The most important deposit of the latter occurs at Furzeham. There are no
ifflications of iron on Windmill Hill.
