The s0lution of saponified chlorophyll, from which the petroleum-ether and the
ether had removed the above pigments, showed also a changed spectrum, its bands
now reading : 1st, X 649 to X 620'5 ; 2nd, X 6025 to X 582.

To 8ee the exact change which had taken place by saponification an ether-alcohol
s0lution was evaporated down and the residue dissolved in absolute alcohol ; a green
solution was thus obtained showing spectrum 13, Chart IT., of which the bands read:
1st, X 669 to A 649; 2nd, X 640 to A 627; 8rd, A 613 to X 593; 4th, uncertain; and
on comparing these measurements with those of the bands of the first absolute alcobol
solution a great discrepancy is apparent. Moreover, the results of saponifying grass
chlorophyll do not exactly coincide with those obtained by saponifying that of Primula,
but even in the case of grass the results are not by any means constant. Whether
this is due to the fact that chlorophyll varies in composition according to season remains
to be proved, but the following observations show that such discrepancies may occur.

A solution obtained by digesting grass in ether, to which rectified spirit had
been added, gave a series of bands agreeing closely with those seen in the above
absolute alcohol solution. They read : 18t, A 679-5 to A 640 ; 2nd, A 629 to A 598 ;
3rd, X 591 to A 566; and 4th (about), X 548'5 to A 532, In a thin layer: 5th,
A 486'5 to A 467 ; and 6th, X 451 to x 438. On saponifying and extracting as des-
cribed above with petroleum-ether, the resulting yellow 8olution showed only to,
not three, bands : the first, X 490'5 to 472; and 2nd, A 458'5 to X 445 (examined by
daylight). The ether extract showed only one feeble band in red, but the ether and
alcohol extract gave spectrum 14, Chart II., the bands reading : 1st, X 669 to X 654;
2nd, X 640 to X 627; 4th, A 543 to A 532; and 5th, A 5115 to A 492:5. The
