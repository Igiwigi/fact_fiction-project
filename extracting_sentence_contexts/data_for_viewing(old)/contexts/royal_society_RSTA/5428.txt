different package.

To give different points of view and balance to my ‘academic’ judgements, I give the two
views from engineering consultants. The first is from Eilif Svensson (ES-Consult, Denmark)

who spent some time with us in the UCL stability group in 1971, and writes in a personal : =
communication (2012): : Ej

Advanced programmes contain hidden assumptions (and semi-hidden in mediocre :s
manuals). Apart from this the user himself has to decide on important assumptions such i=

as boundary conditions—a fact that even the best programme package cannot compensate :3

for through complexity (a great number of degrees of freedom) offering a perception of 8
correctness. In that case the users own simpler, carefully drafted, model may yield better :8
results. Another issue which annoys me from time to time is the unreflecting acceptance of : &

codified provisions. Euro-codes offer an example of this. The physical backgrounds of many
rules are obscure or absent and users apply the rules as blind recipes without questioning
the context and hidden assumptions ‘because then nobody can blame me’. Rules are for the
obedience of fools and guidance of wise men.

Secondly, Prof. Rod Rainey, head of technology (floating structures) at W. S. Atkins plc, writes in
a personal communication (2012):
