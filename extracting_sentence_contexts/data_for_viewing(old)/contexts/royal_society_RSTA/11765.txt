The quantity }g¥, — 4q¥, is evidently the mechanical work which must be spent
in bringing the system together from a state of diffusion, in which, however, each
part is still moving with velocity u parallel to x. It might, perhaps, have been

thought that this amount of work would be equal to the sum of the electric and
magnetic parts of the energy of the system, z.c., to U + T. But instead, we have

Jov, — fyv, =U -T.

The discrepancy arises from the fact that there must be an expenditure of direct
electric and magnetic energy while the system is being collected, in order to maintain
in its proper strength the system of displacement and magnetic currents which

S This transformation enables us to determine the energy of any system for which WY

& If the surface corresponding to the suffix 2 is at an infinite distance from the
.o surface corresponding to the suffix 1, it will generally happen that Y, = 0, and then
