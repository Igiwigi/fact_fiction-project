New reacting systems of chromosomal loci
impinge upon each other, and the resultant is the new form. This at first may be
heterocaryotic, but if true sexual processes occur later, the offspring become homo-
caryotic but heterozygous. Such a hypothesis fits the facts and explains them as I
think no other present hypothesis does. It is not the possibility of mutation in the fungi (and bacteria) that is here denied,
but rather the compulsion to accept that interpretation of the evidence as it now
stands. As the facts present themselves to me, avenues of interpretation other than
that of mutation are still widely open.
