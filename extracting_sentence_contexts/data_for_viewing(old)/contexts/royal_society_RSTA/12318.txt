that the centre of an alloy containing more silver than 65 per cent. would be poorer
in silver than the outside; nevertheless, the authorities, Levon, Roperts-AUSTEN,
and in fact, all who have worked with silver-copper alloys know the contrary to be
the case. Silver is driven inwards notwithstanding the fact that an alloy poor in
silver remains fluid long after the mass as a whole has become comparatively solid.
The platinum-gold alloys now in question behave like the silver-copper series.


OF METALS OF THE PLATINUM GROUP. 635
Palladium-Gold Alloys.

Tt is not an easy matter to obtain trustworthy assays from alloys of gold and
palladium, and this fact first called my attention to the liquation of this metal from
gold.

I melted an alloy of ninety parts pure gold with ten parts of pure palladium in a
plumbago crucible in a wind-oil furnace (several times to ensure mixture), and then
cast this into a spherical mould, which gave a sphere of about 5 kilogs. of the alloy.

This sphere, which I call F’, was cut into halves. The following are the determina-
ons of the gold results from various parts of the hemisphere—the palladium can
gafely be taken by the difference :—
