to the more rapid extension of the kathodic than the anodic flank, a differential change in
their growth rates will bring about a corresponding change in their asymmetry. Also if
either flank is promoted relatively to the other it will extend farther round the apex before

meeting the other flank and then will prevent it from extending any more. For at their
extreme base the flanks of each leaf meet and unite, as already mentioned (p. 138), but
do not overlap.

The greatest increase in the anodic arc of J, occurred in nos. 7 and 8, in which the angle
I-I, also showed the greatest increase above the normal. These facts suggested the possi-
bility that there might be some regular relationship between the increase in length of the
anodic halves of /, and the increase in the divergence angle [\-/,. This relationship is
shown on a graph (figure 10) in which the angle J,—J, is shown on the ordinates and the
angle subtended by the anodic half of J, on the abscissae. The graph shows clearly that
the arc of the anodic half of J, increases as the angle J,|—J, increases except in no. 3, in which
the anodic half is unduly small. This exception will be discussed below.

The increase in the angle /,;—J, has already been explained as the result of the removal of
the centre of P, and the consequent decrease in the repulsion exerted by that leaf on the
centres of J, and J,. Variations in this angle were considered to be due to variations in the
amount of the centre of P, that was removed and in the degree to which P, was cut down
(see p. 148). Since the arc of the anodic half of /, varies directly with the angle J,—-/,, there
