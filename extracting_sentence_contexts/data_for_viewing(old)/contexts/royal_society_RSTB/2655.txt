the corallite, and continues the mesenterial canals beyond the visceral cavity of the
polyp over the costie and ccsnenchyme, This edge-zone passes then imperceptibly
into true ccenosareal flesh, clothing these parts of the ccenenchyme which are more
remote from the corallites, and as a rule less regularly built.

Septocorallia.

I have already described under Murocorallia the one type of trabecular structure
and direction in the septum, which characterised a very large number of the earliest
known corals. The other type which stood in strong contradistinction to it was
shown by the ancient Cyathophyllids. The septa of the Cyathophyllids were as a
rule of considerable breadth, that is, they projected a long distance into the lumen of
the calyx. Correlated with this, is the fact that the central tabulate area was relatively
small, while the broad peripheral area had a rich, basal deposit of dissepiments in the
interseptal loculi. The septa had a greater extent of surface, speaking generally, in
Cyathophyllids than in Zaphrentids, and that fact in itself sufficiently explains the
greater elaboration of their trabecular structure. Strength and firmness seem to
have been the law governing the septal skeleton, and clearly the attainment of this
might call for considerable deviation of plan in the arrangement of trabecul
according to the dimensions or shape of the septum,

In the Cyathophyllids the ground-plan was to have all the trabecule pointing to
the upper edge of the septum. It may be observed in living corals that the shape of
a septum frequently goes on changing during the growth of a young polyp, and the
first-formed trabeculw cannot, in that case, point to the ultimate upper edge of the
