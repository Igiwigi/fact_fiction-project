water, been detached from the ring of gutta-percha which had been placed between
‘the cooling tube and the tube down which it passed. Many of these fragments had
collected beneath the base of the cylinder at B* and must have considerably impeded
the flow of water. In consequence, therefore, before putting the apparatus together
pgain, we removed all remaining gutta-percha surfaces which were exposed to the
Qetion of the water. The values obtained for K were, from this time, very different
‘Jrom preceding ones, and, once obtained, remained constant as long as the same mass
“pf water was used.
& The experiments J 20 to 34, are in better agreement amongst themselves than the
@arlier ones, and the cause no doubt is that just indicated.
] The mean result of the earlier experiments is satisfactory as likewise the mean
time of each experiment, but the times over small ranges (especially in experiments
Qos. J 5 to 12) leave much to be desired. The fact that the quantity of heat
leveloped by the stirrer was increased by the removal of the gutta-percha frag-
‘nents is a proof that the flow of water was appreciably diminished by the

bstruction.

a Section XIJ.—Tuer Gatn or Loss By Rapriation, &c.

= Tt has already been pointed out that the method of observation adopted enabled us
to determine, with sufficient accuracy, the total loss or gain of heat per second at any
gtemperature, apart from the supply due to current. We propose to use the phrase
a non-electrical supply ” to denote heat due to all other sources than the current.
