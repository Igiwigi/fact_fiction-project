Considering the theoretical interest connected with the obscure phenomenon in
question, it mnst appear very desirable that novel facts should be ascertained calcu-
lated to throw light upon, and lead to the true insight into, the cause of spontaneous
nitrification. The observations I am about to state will perhaps contribute a little
to obtain that end. Some years ago I ascertained the fact, that a soJution of potash, sufficiently long
treated with air ozonized (by the means of phosphorus), yields a liquid which, being
over-saturated with sulphuric acid and heated, causes a brownish coloration round
a crystal of sulphate of iron, and has the power of destroying indigo*. From that
fact I inferred at the time that the reactions indicated are due to the presence of a
nitrate. Some time after I found out that the acid liquid called phosphatic acid, produced
during the action of phosphorus upon moist atmospherie air, enjoys likewise the
property of destroying indigo.
