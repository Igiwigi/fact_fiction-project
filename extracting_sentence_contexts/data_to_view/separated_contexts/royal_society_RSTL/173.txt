If there be a small aperture only, leaving the malleus with its
natural attachment, no difference in the power of the organ is
perceptible; the membrane vibrates, and communicates its vibra-
tions, as before. If the whole of the membrane be destroyed, and
three out of four of the small bones of the tympanum be re-
moved, an almost total deafness ensues; but the ear, after a
time, begins to recover its powers, and, in the end, regains
them, with that degree of imperfection only, which, in my for-
mer Paper, I have described in the case of Mr. P + The
following fact appears to confirm the truth of this statement. Mr. RaprorD, surgeon, of Newington Butts, informs me, that
in the year 1779, he attended a woman who had an ulcer in the
throat, by which a portion of the palate was destroyed, and the
tonsils and Eustachian tube s0 much injured, that in the attempt
to swallow, a' part of the liquid ran through her ears; yet, not-
withstanding these ravages, she neither complained of any de-
fect in her hearing, nor had the slightest appearance of deafness.
