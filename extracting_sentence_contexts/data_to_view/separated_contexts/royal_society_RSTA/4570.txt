High rise RC buildings with robust columns and walls can withstand
tsunami flow depths over 2m and can be used for vertical evacuation. However, at the same


time, at least eight RC or steel construction buildings have been found overturned or washed
away. This fact led to a revision of the requirement for structural design of tsunami evacuation
buildings [51], specifically focusing on the tsunami loading effect. School buildings should
have similar construction requirements, in order to ensure childrenâ€™s safety. Teachers, parents
and children should have more opportunities to learn about their risk and how to survive in
emergency situations.
