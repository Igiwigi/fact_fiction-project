the case for G. bimaculatus [41], then this might provide both a
vital protective function and a circadian clock in early life
which are disrupted by the presence of urban night lighting.
The variation in female investment of melatonin may also
explain the lack of observed variation in fecundity in the cur-
rent experiment, as females were mated to males that were
maintained under normal light conditions. Thus it is conceiv-
able that male-derived melatonin transferred during mating
was able to mitigate variation in female condition during
egg-laying sensu the distasteful cantharidins transferred
during mating by the male beetle, Neopyrochroa flabellate,
which females then allocate to eggs, so providing them
with protection from predation [96]. The fact that the effect
of melatonin supplementation on immune function varied
highlights the complexity of the underlying relationships
between light, melatonin and life history traits. It also
suggests that, regardless of taxa, caution should be exercised
when making general inferences about the benefits of melato-
nin based on single trait assays because the relationship
between melatonin concentration and immune function (for
example) may not be comparable or indeed indicative of
the relationship between melatonin and survival [82,93]. It
is highly conceivable that, despite its ubiquity, species-level
differences in life history and ontogeny will determine the
relative importance of melatonin for circadian rhythm or
