red up to its limits and not in the least orange. It is interesting to consider what,
in the light of the other observations, the colour of this red ought to be. The
positive after-effect contains three dazzle-tints, green, blue, and violet. All of these
must be active in the region from A to C, because the light from that part of the
spectrum excites none of these colours. The green and the violet will balance
each other as regards their effect upon the hue, and the blue will accordingly impart
a tinge of crimson to the red. Farther on, in the region normally occupied by
green, the green dazzle-tint will be inoperative ; for those parts of the spectrum in
which a negative after-effect (fatigue effect) has been produced, seem to lose the power
of bringing out the corresponding positive after-effect (dazzle-tint) of that colour.
Accordingly, the feeble traces of red which extend beyond E and 6 will excite only
the blue and violet dazzle-tints, and not the green, and will, therefore, appear
distinctly purple. As a matter of fact, with a very narrow slit the spectrum seems
for the first few moments to end between b and F in a purplish slate colour. But on
opening the slit the red asserts itself,

Fig. 9, which serves by contrast to bring out the colours of fig. 8, represents the
appearance of the spectrum towards the end of recovery from violet-blindness. The
positive after-effect has nearly passed off and the colours have their normal hue, but
the violet is still invisible.

Fig. 10 shows the appearance of the spectrum during purple-blindness produced
by exposure to sunlight, filtered through magenta and aniline violet. Only the
green sensation is left. It extends brightly from D to F, but is visible nearly as far
as C on the red side and G on the violet side. It is of the same colour throughout,
