behaved so badly that we actually took the trouble to assure ourselves by trial of its
superiority over other materials. We mounted a very fine steel wire, kindly sent to
us by Mr. Exxery of the Melbourne Observatory, on another balance, and observed
that its rate of viscous subsidence was about a hundred times greater than we were
accustomed to in the case of quartz. We repeated the experiment with a very fine
platinum wire with a similar result.

It must not be supposed that all fused quartz, as derived from clear rock crystal,
has the same properties. Almost every crystal examined by us contains both sodium
and lithium—the latter in large spectroscopic quantity—indeed, we first noticed it
from the colour it gave to the blowpipe flame. The observation of the almost universal
presence of lithium in quartz was first made by Tecermerer,* a fact of which we
were ignorant when we made the observation. There also appears to us to be a distinct
though small difference in the viscosity of various samples of fused quartz, and this
independently of the sodium or lithium they may contain. It has been our practice
to select the most infusible quartz independently of the amount of lithium it contains,
for lithium seems to be burned out by continued heating in the oxy-gas flame :
whether this is really the case or whether the lithium forms a compound which does
not give the flame re-action, we have not attempted to inquire. We have aimed at
securing the greatest possible uniformity in the thread and a mean diameter of about
‘0038 centim. We do not passa thread unless the diameter is uniform from end to end
within the limits of observation (exceeding those of measurement), looking at samples
taken from each end of the thread through a microscope magnifying 100 diameters.
We have also spent a great deal of time in trying to make certain that there were no
