point of the wire may not have reached the walls before this process is completed,
and their comparatively slow motion when the wire and walls are at the same
potential enables them to persist for some time. The growth which then takes place
is probably the result of the condensation, upon the nuclei, of some substance produced
by the discharge. The substance may be nitrie acid or HO).

§ 10. BEHAVIOUR OF THE VARIOUS KINDS OF NucLEr IN AN Evecrric Frevp.

It has already been suggested (‘ Camb. Phil. Soc. Proc.,’ loc. cit.) that the nuclei
requiring expansions between 1°25 and 1°37 to make condensation take place on them
ave to be identified with the ions, to which the conductivity of gases exposed to
X-rays or Uranium-rays is due. The only evidence there furnished for this view was _
the fact that in ordinary moist air or other gases such nuclei were found to be present
in exceedingly small numbers, while when the gas was made a conductor by being
exposed to X-rays or Uranium-rays, immense numbers of these nuclei could be
detected.

The experiments with the nuclei produced by the discharge from a pointed platinum
wire, as well as with those which are produced by the exposure of a negatively
charged zine plate to ultra-violet light, support this view, at the same time pointing
to the conclusion that in all these cases the carriers of the electricity are of the same
kind.

A difficulty, however, is introduced by the results obtained with air exposed to
weak ultra-violet light or to the action of certain metals, for in both cases nuclei are
