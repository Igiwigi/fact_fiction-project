Now, as

far as the author is aware, there have been no investigations of the effect of rise of

temperature on the longitudinal elasticity of iron and steel as determined by the
method of vibrations, The author has, however, by the method of static extension,
obtained for unannealed piano steel, and for soft iron, a decrease of longitudinal
elasticity per unit, resulting from a rise of 1° Centigrade, of between "0002 and 0003. *
Further, he has recently obtained from experiments on torsionally vibrating iron wire
at various temperatures a decrease of torsional elasticity amounting to "0008 per unit
per degree Centigrade rise of temperature. Taking all these facts into consideration,
it seems probable that such effects as are produced by even powerful currents on the
longitudinal elasticity are solely to be ascribed to the heat generated by these currents. and the coefli

Discussion of Wrevemany’s Theory respecting the Internal Friction of Metals. It will be now advantageous to review very briefly some of the results recorded in
this and the author's two previous memoirs on the internal friction of metals, with the
object of ascertaining how far these results support WispEMANn’s ingenious theory
respecting the cause of the friction.
