Herrwie finds a single one. From BirscHutâ€™s figures it appears
he was dealing with microspherie forms. The frequent occurrence of a single nucleus in the genera which have been examined
is in harmony with the fact that the megalospheric form usually far outnumbers the
microspheric. It is probable, however, that the nuclear history differs to some extent
in different groups of Foraminifera. It may also be observed that, as I shall show
presently in the case of Polystomella, bodies which I believe to be formed in the
elaboration of the food may possess staining properties and be thus readily mistake
for nuclei.
