In the immature or Mastigopus stage (56 CLAus's * Ueber einige Schizopoden und
niedere Malacostraken, Messinas * ) the three forms are almost exactly alike, except
as far as the generic distinctions are concerned, and the young Sergestes scarcely
differs from the young Lucifer except in the absence of a neck, the length of the
flagellum of the second antenna, and the presence of rudiments of the fourth and fifth
pairs of pereiopods.

Comparing the whole course of development of the three forms, as far as it is known,
we notice that while the larval stages of Sergestes are much more different than those
of Acetes from the corresponding stages of Lucifer, the character of the change at
each moult is much more like what we have in Lucifer than what we have in Acetes.

We cannot fail to notice, in the second place, that the attempt to express the facts
of the metamorphosis of these forms, s0 far as we know them, in a tree-like diagram,
would result in a tree placed upside down, with the branches which represent the
three Protozovas much more divergent than those which represent the three young
Sergestids. A similarity of type runs through the whole metamorphosis, but it is
no more marked at the early stages than it is in the late stages, while the secondary
differences are much more conspicuous during the Zota and Acanthosoma stages
than they are as we approach the adult form.

While this is true it is also true that if we imagine a 1etamorphosis which
shall agree with these three in all their common features, but shall have none of the
features which they do not all share, we shall have something much more like the
metamorphosis of Lucifer than that of Acetes or Sergestes, and we musb therefore
