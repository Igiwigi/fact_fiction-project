Review. The path to fusion power 1093

Clearly, fusion’s promise is huge. The fact that a tiny amount of lithium
can produce so much electricity, without any production of CO», or air
pollution, is sufficient reason to develop fusion urgently even if success is not
100 per cent certain. There are no known or expected obstacles but there
are certainly challenges. The most obvious challenge—holding fusion fuel at
temperatures 10 times hotter than the centre of the sun—has in fact been
surmounted. Experiments at the Joint European Torus (JET) in the UK regularly
achieve such conditions. Indeed, JET has produced 16 MW of fusion power
(Keilhacker et al. 1999), and the International Tokamak Experimental Reactor
(ITER; the international fusion experiment being constructed in France) is
expected to produce 500 MW for hundreds of seconds at a time.

So fusion works. The big question is: when will it be made to work reliably
and economically on the scale of a power station? Before attempting to answer,
we consider the following questions. What is fusion? What will a fusion power
station look like? What has been achieved? What are the outstanding science
and technological challenges? We will then argue that attaining the first fusion
electricity in about 30 years (the EU goal) is challenging but possible. Every
