Tt may, in fact, be verified that

du - dU _ F
dO, mU, d,s bs

so that wu, U satisfy the differential equations assigned ; also, when @,=0 the
expressions reduce to the corresponding ones for 1—1 intervals, and therefore uv, U
are continuous throughout as functions of }; lastly, at the beginning of the second
interval

“= 7 sinh 16,, U = cosh /6,.

This completes the verification for vu, U, and V, v may be treated similarly.
