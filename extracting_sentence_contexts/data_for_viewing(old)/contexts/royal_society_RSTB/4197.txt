were obtained at the time of performing the initial lesion, and at other times they
were obtained at the physiological examination. In the case of the roots joined in
the experimental anastomosis, the effects of stimulation were usually an expression
of the distribution, not only of the normal root, but also of that of the root which
had been anastomosed to it. These are therefore unfitted for comparison.

The results of stimulation and of excision of the sixth root-in the human plexus
are of importance in consideration of the view that the ordinary type of
Duchenne-Erb paralysis is due to a lesion of the fifth cervical nerve alqne, which
appears to have gained many adherents. All the cases included in the Table
showed the ordinary type of Duchenne’s paralysis, and in these, then, the sixth
nerve, according to the view referred to, ought to have been normal. As a matter
of fact, it was always found that the lesion had involved not only the fifth, but also
the sixth, and, in consequence, the contractions and movements elicited on stimula-
tion of the roots represent spontaneous recovery either in progress or having become
arrested, in every case, however, imperfect. When these contractions were found to

be caused by stimulation of the roots, there is no case where the fifth did not
