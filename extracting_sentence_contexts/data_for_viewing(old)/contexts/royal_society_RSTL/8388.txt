and this to such an extent that even the seyen bones of the carpus and tarsus, notwith-
standing their irregular shape, were always arranged in the same way, 80 that a certain
facet of one bone always touched a certain particular facet, of another, and never other-
wise. That this could really occur in every separate case of creation, is almost as pro-
bable as that seven dice thrown out of a dice-box should give us the same number
of points, similarly arranged in a hundred successive throws. Notwithstanding the
thousands of different relations which might exist between such seven multangular bones,
we get, always only one; and in the whole range of living and extinct animals we seeno
exception to the common rule of typical arrangement of the carpal and tarsal bones.
'The point at isue is, can this uniformity be accounted for by the principle of special
AJreation, or by the theory of descent and modification? No naturalist can in our time
hesitate between the two; and while all the adduced facts are wholly inexplicable by
Zhe first theory, they seem most, natural in the light of the second. We may still not
Se fully informed as to all the true causes which induced the variation and consequent
glifferentiation of animal types; but the principle of descent must be conceded as the only
ne by which all future researches into the structure of the extinct world must be
Truided.
5 I have mentioned chiefly the carpal bones ; but the study of the tarsus leads to pre-
Sisely the same result, and the likeness of the tarsal bones in all Paridigitata is perhaps
Sven more striking than that of the carpals. All Paridigitata have a calcaneum with a
Special facet for the fibula, an astragalus with a double pulley, a cuboid supporting the
Jourth and fifth digits, and a navicular, with three cuneiforms, for the support of the
AIbird and second digits; the first digit being always lost, its tarsal bone is gone to give
Support to the second toe, or, if this be lost, to the radiment of it. We shall see these
