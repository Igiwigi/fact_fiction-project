OPERATIONAL TRANSFORM OF PROBLEM
With axes as defined previously we introduce the Laplace transform, with respect to z,

of the fundamental equation

ae) ig 0p wo?

Ox? * Oy? 027° Thus, if d(x, y) = ) e-'=4(x,y, Z) dz is the Laplace transform of ¢, then, using the fact that

with our choice of axes ¢, 04/0z are zero over the plane z = 0
