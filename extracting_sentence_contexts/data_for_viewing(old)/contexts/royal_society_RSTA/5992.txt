Now, since in this example ||H’(s)|| is finite and A-independent for all s, in fact the projection P
is not necessary and known bounds are already A-independent. Indeed, the JRS bound for 6(s*)
quoted in equation (2.1) is clearly A-independent for the present example (recall corollary 2.2)).
Thus, in the next subsection, we consider an example where ||H’(s)|| diverges with A.

(ii) Time-dependent mutual inductance matrix

Generally, to implement a standard adiabatic quantum computing or quantum annealing
protocol, the mutual inductance matrix Mj; cannot be constant (e.g. see [46]). Thus we
consider a second example of a circuit Hamiltonian of superconducting flux qubits, which
is more appropriate for both quantum annealing and our purpose of demonstrating the case
of unbounded Hamiltonians with cutoff. Consider the Hamiltonian in equation (5.1) and its
derivative
