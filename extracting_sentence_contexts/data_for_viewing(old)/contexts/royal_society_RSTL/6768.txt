i we can only give the amount of the dry matter of the plants produced. But,
mparing this with that of the seed sown, and looking to the proportions of Nitrogen
E0 the produce of barley in the other cases, there is no reason to believe that the result
Syould have formed any exception to that indicated in the other experiments.
= In concluding our remarks on the results with the Graminacee grown without any
Hurther supply of combined Nitrogen than that contained in the seed sown, we would
to refer the reader to the foregoing consideration of the conditions possibly favour-
le to the assimilation of free Nitrogen (p. 517 et 8eq.).
V It will be remembered that, in experimenting with Graminacew, including some of the
Yame description as those experimented upon by ourselves, M. BoussINGAULT and
5 Vurs obtained most unaccountably discordant results. It will be seen that our
results, from nine experiments with snch plants, go to confirm those of M. Bouss1N-
UL. In fact, 8 far as our labours with these plants bear upon their experiments,
they could not have given a more decided result.

Lequminous Plants.
It 8till remains to consider the results of our experiments with Leguminous plants
grown under similar conditions to those of the Graminaceous ones above discussed, and to
5 how far they serye to explain the known characteristics of such plants when grown in
Practical agriculture, to which attention has been directed in Part First of this Paper.
