tomy, for the sake of those deductions which can be attained by no other
means : and that a zeal for its cultivation may be preserved among us. There
is an obvious practical benefit derived from anatomy, but the public do not
comprehend its importance as a science. It is to the Royal Society that those
who prosecute this science must look for countenance in their slow and painful
investigations,

Nine years ago, at the request of our late President, I submitted to the
Society a paper on the Nervous System ; in which I arranged the nerves strictly
according to the anatomy, and illustrated the principles of the arrangement,
by exhibiting the different functions of the Nerves of the Face. On presenting
a 8econd paper on the same part of the nervous system after 80 considerable a
lapse of time, there will be some novelty both in the facts and in the illustra-
tions ; yet I haye more gratification in showing that after the most minute in-
quiries in different countries, my positions drawn from the anatomy have been
admitted, and my reasoning on the experiments, with one exception, found to
be correct. Confident in the accuracy of my deductions from the anatomy of
the fifth nerve, I had attributed to one of its branches a function which be-

longs to another branch of the same nerve. The subject will form a part of
the present paper.

After the announcement of the facts in my first paper, the inquiry became
interesting from its application to. medical practice. I must take another
opportunity of thanking those gentlemen who have 80 liberally afforded addi-
