On the whole, then, the evidence supports the view that the ionization through which the
whistlers travel is of extra-terrestrial origin. It must be admitted, however, that the electron
densities required at great heights are uncomfortably large.

This work has formed part ofa programme of radio research conducted at the Cavendish
Laboratory with the support of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, to
which body I am also indebted for a maintenance allowance.

I would like to express my gratitude to Mr K. W. 'Tremellen for giving me the benefit in
discussion and correspondence of his earlier experience in this field. My thanks are also due

* ‘The argument involved considering how fully the atmosphere in these regions could possibly be ionized,
bearing in mind the fact that pulse echoes are not observed from above the F, layer, and then calculating as
a function of the assumed temperature the dispersion which such a distribution of ionization would produce.

Full account was taken of the effect of diffusion in limiting the degree of ionization at high levels, and of the
variation with height of the acceleration of gravity and the magnetic field strength.


AN INVESTIGATION OF WHISTLING ATMOSPHERICS 139

to the Director and staff of the *Sferic’ organization of the Air Ministry Meteorological
Office for their co-operation in the work of locating the sources of the atmospheric clicks
which gave rise to whistlers, and to Mr P. W. A. Bowe who assisted by photographing their
wave-forms. To the remainder of my colleagues in the laboratory, and in particular to
