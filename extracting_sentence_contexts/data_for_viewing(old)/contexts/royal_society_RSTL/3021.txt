nation with a much less proportion of sulphur than is contained in copper
pyrites, though the latter is one of the best mineral conductors of electricity.

There are many other analogous examples, which prove that no conclusion
can be drawn A priori, from the nature or chemical arrangements of minerals,
as to their relative electrical properties.

Much time and attention have been bestowed by geologists on the conside-
ration of the origin and comparative ages of veins, and but little, I apprehend,
on the purposes for which they are designed.

It appears to me that it will prove a vain attempt to reconcile a nultitude
of facts obseryable in our mines with any known natural causes.

I may refer to a few of them :â€”

1st. The very oblique descent of a large proportion of the veins into the
earth, in some cases in very hard rock, and in others in ground 0 soft that
it would immediately fall in, however small the excavation, without being
completely supported by timber. Were it possible to conceive fissures to exist
under such circumstances, it is not reasonable to suppose that they would not
take the direction in which the resistance would be least, that is, either the
vertical, or the line of the cleavage of the rocks.

2nd. Veins are often divided into branches, which unite again at a consider-
