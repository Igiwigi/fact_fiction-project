§4 (F) We have thus indicated how the final molecular velocities c’,, c’, are to be
determined (cf. 43) in terms of the initial velocities ¢,, ¢ or ¢), Cx together with p and e
(these being the eight independent variables of an encounter). This has been done
by showing how c’, depends upon ¢p, p and e; it has in fact been shown that the
spherical polar co-ordinates of ¢’,, referred to cy, and the plane ¢,, cy, as initial line and
plane, are Op, x12 (a function of p and Cy) and e. Hence we may at once write down

the expressions for the initial and final velocities and velocity components in terms
of ¢, Cp, p and e, as follows :—
