Historically, the A-term in the gravitational field equations was introduced by Einstein 105
years ago [12], but the ‘cosmological constant problem’ (CCP) as such was first formulated 50
years later by Zeldovich [13-15]. The CCP is the baffling realization that the successful QFT
methods applied to the world of the elementary particles seem to predict an effective value
for Pyac Which is devastatingly much larger than the value of the current critical density of the
universe (which the VED should be comparable with) [16-23]. The first theoretical models trying
to cope with the CCP from a field theoretical viewpoint were models of dynamical scalar fields,
see particularly the prototype model by Dolgov in [24,25] and other attempts which appeared
shortly afterwards [26-32]. They endeavoured to explain the value of the vacuum energy in terms
of a dynamical mechanism, e.g. an effective potential of a cosmic scalar field which settles down
automatically (hence without fine-tuning) to the present small value, p?,.. As an example, see
the ‘cosmon’ attempt in [28] and its ulterior discussion by Weinberg in [16]. Unfortunately, no
model of this kind ever succeeded as yet in achieving such an unattainable dream, as in fact
an unsurmountable stumbling block was placed in their way in the form of a ‘no-go theorem’
formulated by Weinberg [16].

In the meantime, a new generation of scalar field models gave rise to the notion of
quintessence. They appeared in the market in two different waves separated by almost a decade
[33-36]. Quintessence models were all aimed at a much more modest purpose: rather than trying
to explain the value of p9,, (the hardest aspect of the CCP, i.e. the ‘old cosmological constant
problem’) they focused instead on the so-called ‘cosmic coincidence problem’ [37,38], viz. why
p2,. is so close to the present matter density. It is, however, disputable whether this is a problem
at all, see e.g. [39,40]. In any case, phenomenological solutions to the purported problem have
been put forward from very different perspectives, see e.g. [41-45], among many others. Let us
also mention that in the interreign period mediating in between the appearance of the first scalar
