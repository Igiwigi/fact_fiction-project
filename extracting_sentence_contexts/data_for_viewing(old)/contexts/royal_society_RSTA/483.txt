equation from which the effective eddy scale could be obtained. At the time, before the arrival
of the digital computer, this idea could not be properly tested. However, the late 1960s and

early 1970s saw a burgeoning of such ‘two-equation turbulence models’, e.g. [21-23], that (as the Dos
numerical capabilities of computational solvers progressively expanded) were applied to mimic : =
increasingly complex practical turbulent flows. Sy

Success in the computational modelling of such flows was by no means always achieved, a
however. Besides the considerable empiricism embedded in any of the scale-determining ty
transport equations, the assumption that the behaviour of turbulent flows could be modelled via : _
an assumed eddy viscosity was itself a highly limiting concept that became less and less tenable : Ss
as attention shifted to flows with increasingly complex strain fields. Indeed, in many cases, there : S
would be the added complication of force-field effects such as buoyancy, too. In fact, from the : Ss
1930s, physicists had been seeking ways to approximate the turbulent stresses by routes that did :&

not assume a linear connection between strain rate and Reynolds stress. Proposals were advanced
for determining all relevant second- and third-moment turbulent velocity products directly from
transport equations, e.g. [24]. There was, however, no prospect (or risk) of these proposals being
tested: their advocates were purely armchair explorers! J. C. Rotta is the person who did most to
cut these fanciful ideas down to size. He proposed [25] that, in addition to a scale-determining
equation, one should simply solve transport equations for the Reynolds stresses. Indeed at least
one of his proposed approximations for processes that could not be handled exactly is still
widely used today. Current achievements with such models are summarized inter alia in a recent
textbook [26].
