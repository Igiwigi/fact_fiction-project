We would like to express f(s*) via f’(s) as

st
f(s*) =Po +| f'(s) ds. (3.3)

Recalling that Utot satisfies equation (1.1) and Ugg satisfies equation (2.9), the derivative is
f' (6) = Po(Utg Utot + Ut gUlge) = Polite — [P,P] — itp) Utor = —Pollt IP", Plot, (3-4)

where we used P’* = P’. Note how the O(tf) term cancelled out, so the expression appears to be
O(1). However, it is in fact O(1/tp), as we show next.
For any operator X(s) define X(s) (‘twiddle-X’) [22] such that

[X(s), P(s)] = [H(s), X(s)] (3.5)

and the diagonal of X in the eigenbasis of H(s) is zero. Note that X has units of time relative to X.
For instance, P’~ is defined by®

[P'(s), P(s)] = [H(s), P (s)]. (3.6)

The details of why X exists and how it is expressed via X are given in §4. Proceeding with
bounding equation (3.4), we can now rewrite it as
