At the moment of applying it it appears blood red} ; when half dry it has a splendid blue colour
and lustrous metallic reflection;§ when quite dry this metallic effect disappears and the colour is matt
blue.” ||

Lastly , in the case of the films discussed in § 11 above, the colour depended on the
fact that the density of the film was less than that of the metal composing the film
when in its normal state; but pressure increased the density to its normal value, at
the same time bringing out the normal colour, both by reflected and by transmitted
light, of the metal. And Carry Lea’s silvers “show a lower specific gravity than

that of normal silver ;’I and pressure “instantly converted gold-coloured allotropic
silver into normal silver.” **

We conclude from the above evidence that this silver was not “allotropic,” but
consisted of normal silver in a finely divided state.
