was placed in water in a U-tube, into which mercury was poured, the whole being
covered with a bell-jar standing in water. There were five leaves on the branch,
which was left in a laboratory with a north aspect on August 22. No water was
seen on the leaves till the 25th, when there was a large drop on the apex of the
third leaf. On the 27th there was another drop on the second leaf. By the 28th the
formation of outgrowths had begun, and the experiment was removed to the tropical
pit to hasten their formation. In two days the youngest leaf was thickly covered on
the upper side and strongly curled downwards. There were also a few outgrowths
on the second and third leaves ; the fourth had dropped off, the fifth was free.

The turgidity of the cells in the outgrowths and the extreme thinness of their
walls, as well as the presence of large round stomata, taken in connection with the
fact that the intumescences are formed when transpiration is checked, suggest the
possibility that they may be a sort of abnormal organ for the direct excretion
of water, either through the cell-walls or through the stomata by filtration under
pressure.

Experiments on the secretion of drops of water by plants have been made by
Nestruer,* who finds that all the Malvacee which he examined, which included some
species of JZishiscus, form drops of water in a damp atmosphere. NesTLer is of
opinion that the hairs in Malvacew play a part in the secretion of water. But in
