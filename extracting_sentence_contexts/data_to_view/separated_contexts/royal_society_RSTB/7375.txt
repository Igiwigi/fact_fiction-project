Before considering this problem, however, it should be pointed out that these
basic proteins constitute quantitatively major components of cell nuclei, for they
represent from 20 to 30 % of the dry weight of the various nuclei examined. As such
they must in part be responsible for the formation of one or other of the chief structures
of the nucleus. It has been shown elsewhere (Stedman & Stedman 19474, 6) that, in
combination with nucleic acid, they do, in fact, form the nuclear sap in the resting and
prophase, and the spindle in the metaphase, nucleus. For the exercise of such structural
functions, which cannot of course be wholly divorced from physiological ones, cell speci-
ficity would presumably be inessential. In order to gain some insight into the meaning
of the specificity it is therefore necessary to attempt to visualize the more purely physio-
logical functions of the basic proteins.
