dinucleotides and gained TpG/CpA dinucleotides throughout
evolution [19,20]. Certain regions of the mammalian genome,
however, have preserved their CpG dinucleotides in spite of
such evolutionary pressure [21]. These genomic regions lack
DNA methylation in germ cells, so spontaneous deamination
can easily be repaired without error [21]. Such genomic regions
are called CpG islands and have been suggested to be proximal
to important regulatory regions [22].

While histone modifications and their modifying enzymes
are well conserved from yeasts to humans, DNA methylation
exhibits surprising diversity in regulatory mechanisms and
genome-wide profiles over various organisms. In fact, the
distributions, regulatory mechanisms and potential functions
of DNA methylation are extremely diverse in eukaryotic
genomes. Many model organisms, such as Saccharomyces
cerevisiae and Caenorhabditis elegans, lack DNA methylation
[23]. Drosophila melanogaster has only trace amounts of non-
CpG methylation during embryonic stages, and lose most


methylation by adulthood [24]. On the other hand, honeybees yet. Only a few studies directly demonstrated the causality

and silk moths have around 10% CpG methylation over gene of DNA methylation on transcriptional repression and there
bodies, but not within intergenic regions [25]. Plants, such as is still no report of manipulated DNA methylation to study
