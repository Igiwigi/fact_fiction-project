Tf in the same way a 8ection of pitted tissne, e.9., pulvinus of Robinia, be treated
with methylene blue, both the cell wall and the pit membrane become coloured, But
if the section be first treated with 8ulphuric acid, the swollen or dissolved cell wall
will remain unstained and only the closing membrane and the sides of the pits will
alone be stained blue. Now, if it be allowed that callus may be regarded as altered protoplasm, ib might
be suggested from the foregoing reactions that cell wall is to be looked upon as
altered pit membrane, or rather that pit membrane is to be regarded as consisting
of cell wall that has retained its original properties and has undergone comparatively
little chemical change. However, I prefer at present to draw no definite conclusions
from these observed phenomena but merely desire 40 put forward the facts.t

On the structure of pulvint. Having thus treated of the methods employed, and made some remarks as to the
nature of the pit membrane, I am now in a position to proceed with the description of
my investigation of the structure of pulvini. This work was commenced in the
Wirzburg laboratory in the month of July, 1882, under the direction, and at the
8uggestion, of Professor SAons.
