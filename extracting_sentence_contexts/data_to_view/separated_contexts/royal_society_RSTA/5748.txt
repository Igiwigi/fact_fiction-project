The emerging picture of infinitely many coupled spatial points oscillating chaotically and
indefinitely towards the past singularity, exhibiting chaos on all scales in a spatio-temporal
manner, makes it plausible to suppose that it may soon get unstable and continue as an out-
of-control system exhibiting complex behaviour. This is perhaps related to the acknowledged
difficulty in obtaining universally acceptable results with clear descriptions and explanations. Indeed, even for the homogeneous Mixmaster case, there are few completely established facts,
cf. [38]. The problem of understanding the behaviour of a complex system that includes an arbitrary
number of (often chaotically) oscillating subsystems coupled to each other in different ways is,
of course, a central one in modern nonlinear dynamics. This problem is usually characterized, on
the one hand, by the inexorable increase of entropy towards states of ever greater disorder, and on

the other, by the ability of subsystems to assemble together and form diverse structures we often : =
see all around us.
