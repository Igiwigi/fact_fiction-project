BeRzetivs's mean number, calculated for V, O,, is found to be 52:55 with a mean error

of 0-12, whilst the subsequent estimations of Czrpxowicz serve only as an approximate
control of BgerzeLIvs's number, giving a mean of 55:35 with a mean error of 2:33,

* A special experiment proved that every trace of sulphuric acid is easil

y expelled from yanadium pentoxide on
ignition. PROFESSOR ROSCOE'S RESEARCHES ON VANADIUM. El

The fact that these older determinations all give a higher number than the above
experiments, shows either that the acid was not fully oxidized, or, more probably, that
the oxide was not completely reduced. It has already been stated (1) that the presence
of the slightest trace of phosphorus prevents the complete reduction of the pentoxide to
trioxide in hydrogen, (2) that all the naturally occurring vanadium ores contain phos-
phorus which can only be detected, when present in small traces, by molybdic acid, a
test unknown in BERzEL1Us's time, and (3) that the complete separation of phosphorus
from vanadium is attended with great difficulty. Hence we may fairly conclude that
the difference of 1:15 in the atomic weight between the above experiments and those of
BeRzEL1vs is due to the presence of small traces of phosphorus in the vanadic acid used
by the great Swede.
