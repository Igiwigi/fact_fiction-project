In the further deyelopment of the plates their outline is entirely altered, the triangle is
lost, and, principally by prolongation of the outer inferior angle, the. plate is converted
into a broad wavy band. Compare fig. 5, Plate VI., figs. 1 & 4, Plate VII. It is very
difficult to obtain the plates when they have assumed this latter form, as this change
only occurs in a condition of very adyanced development, when the plates have usually
become more or less united with the contiguous elements of the tooth.

While the plates are increasing in area they become denser, thicker, and there now
appear upon them, when viewed in a suitable light, certain lines having the same con-
tour as the outlines of the plates themselves: these are indications of progressive growth,


are, in fact, incremental lines, and they are chiefly conspicuous at the outer angle, where
the most rapid change has of late been going on (se Plate VII. fig. 4). As has been
already observed, these lines are best seen by employing bright sunlight and directing
the reflector of the microscope obliquely to one side of the field of vision.

The primary plates require very careful observation ; they are, as I have before
remarked, the physiological axis of the tooth, and dependent on them and attached to
them are all the supplemental elements which enter into the construction of the organ.

- The two series of primary plates have a definite and constant arrangement. As they
are free in the little aqueous sac that contains them, merely imbricated one over the
other without any attachment, it is difficult 80 to place them under the microscope as
