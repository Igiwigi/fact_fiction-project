Again, if both firs and
second crops are heavy, or the second only is heavy, in any partieular 8eason, this will
have 8ome effect, not only on the botany, and the general character, of the vegetation,
but more or less on the condition of the land also, for the growth of the first crop the
next year. The results recorded in the table illustrate the great variation in the conditions
referred to, from 8eason to season. In regard to the amounts of second crop indicated
by the estimates, ib may be observed that, judging from the actual weights of the
second crops obtained in 1875, 1877, and 1878, it may be concluded that the pre-
viously estimated amounts were more probably too low than too high ; though ib is
true that these later seasons were more favourable for second growth than the majority
of the earlier ones, for which estimates only were made, In fact, it was partly on
account of the luxuriance of the second crops of these later years, that it was decided
to cut and remove them from the land. Tt is probable, however, that a larger amount
of the dry substance of the deficiently matured gecond, than of the better matured
first crops of grass, would be required as food, and that therefore the estimate of
16 lbs. of snch hay consumed per head per week may be too low. Turning to the summaries at the bottom of the table, ib is observed that, although
without manure the amounts of produce, of both first and second crops, are small, the
proportion of second crop to first is greater than under either of the elected manurial
conditions; that is, i is greater where the total removal from the land is comparatively
small, and where, especially, the variety of the herbage is the greatest, and where,
consequently, the possession by the roots of the upper layers of the soil, and the
capabilities of food-collection generally, will be the most yaried.
