42 SIR DAVID BREWSTER ON A REMARKABLE PROPERTY OF THE DIAMOND.

a compoxite crystal consisting of a great number of individual erystals, like certain
specimens of feldspar, carbonate of lime, and other minerals; but it is more difficult
to conceive that the terminal planes of these individual crystals should retain their
relative inclination after undergoing the operations of grinding and polishing upon
a lapidary's wheel. To many persons such a result may appear inadmissible ; but there are several phy-
sical facts, which, when well considered, cannot fail to diminish its improbability. If we grind and polish a surface of mother-of-pearl obliquely to the strata of which
it is compoxed, we shall find it impossible to produce a perfectly flat surface: even
if we grind it on the finest and softest hone, and polish it with the smoothest powder,
the termination of each stratum will remain ; and while the general surface reflects a
white image, the grooves or striz will give rise to the beautiful prismatic images
produced by interference*,

Another analogous fact presented itself to me many years ago in examining calca-
reous spar. Having had occasion to form an artificial face upon one of the edges of
the rhomb containing the obtuse angle, I used a coarse file without water, and found
that it exposed faces of cleavage which had never been previously seen, and which
were inclined to the general surface produced by the file.
