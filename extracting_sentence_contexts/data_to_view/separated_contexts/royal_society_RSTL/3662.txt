Finally, we have a case adduced by M. Mavrevccr which suggests a
crucial experiment to which all our previous reasoning has been subimitted, by which
its accuracy has been proved, and the insufficiency of the assumption, that the dia-
magnetic force is not polar, is reduced to demonstration. When we remember that
against all this no single experimental fact or theoretic argument+ which can in any

to labour under the disadyantage of proving too much, his conclusion being equally fatal to polarity of all
kinds.
