The development of synchrotron radiation topography in the late 1970s led
o a resurgence of interest and the development of dedicated beamlines for X-ray
imaging at the major synchrotron radiation laboratories. Andrew himself has moved
with these developments and even in retirement remains an active user of the Dares-
ury SRS. This volume also attests to the fact that many of those originally inspired
o work in X-ray topography have branched into other fields of X-ray science, from
omographic crack imaging to the application of genetic algorithms to the inverse
roblem of X-ray scattering. For this issue we invited former students, postdoctoral visitors, colleagues and
summer school associates of Andrew to submit papers relevant to the Theme. Some,
of course, for various reasons, had to decline the invitation, but we were delighted by

he response and enthusiasm of all to the idea of the Theme Issue.
