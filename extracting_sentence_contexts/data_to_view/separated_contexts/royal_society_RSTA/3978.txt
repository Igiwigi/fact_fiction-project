The deformed marble is uniform and compact, and seems to break with equal ease

in all directions. It differs somewhat in appearance from the original rock in possess-
ing a dead white colour, somewhat like chalk, the glistening cleavage surfaces of the
calcite being no longer visible, and the difference being well brought out in certain
cases owing to the fact that a certain portion of the original marble often remains
unaltered and unaffected by the pressure. This, when present, has the form of two
cones of obtuse angle, whose bases are the original ends of the column resting against
the faces of the steel plugs, while the apices extend into the mass of the deformed
marble and point toward one another. These cones, or rather parabolas of rotation,
are developed, as is well known, in all cases where cubes of rock, Portland cement, or
cast iron are crushed in a testing machine in the ordinary manner.
