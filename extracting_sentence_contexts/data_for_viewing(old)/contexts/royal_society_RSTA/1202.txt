these data projected for different geometries. These observations appear consistent with more
recent ultraviolet observations obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope [9,31-33] and show
emission in the form of discrete faint spots. At Neptune, no unambiguous detection of auroral
emission made [13]—the only magnetized planet in our solar system without a single observation
of its auroral emissions.

The only vertical temperature profiles of the upper atmospheres of Uranus and Neptune in
existence were derived from UVS observations [13,14]—shown in figure 1. Both planets were
observed to have a temperature of 750 K at their respective exobase, but Uranus displayed
a much more extended upper atmosphere compared to Neptune. This is because the weak
vertical mixing lowers the altitude of the homopause [23], producing a more extended upper
atmosphere. It is noteworthy that the temperature profiles in figure 1b are constrained by only
a handful of measurements, highlighting the fact that Uranus and Neptune remains the most
poorly characterized planets in the solar system.

5, The era of H3"

Emissions from Hy were discovered for the first time outside the laboratory at Jupiter in 1988
[34] as Voyager 2 was approaching Neptune. By analysing the observed H} near-infrared spectra
we can derive the temperature of the upper atmosphere, the column integrated density of the
ionosphere, and radiative cooling rates. These products provide a powerful view through which
we can begin to understand the processes that govern the upper atmosphere.
