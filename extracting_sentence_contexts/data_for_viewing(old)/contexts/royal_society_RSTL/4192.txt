diameter 0*7.

Position 1. 468
Position 2. 482
Position 3. 493

In changing therefore from position 1 to position 3, a deflection corresponding to
twenty-five divisions of the scale was produced.


244 PROFESSOR TYNDALL'S FURTHER RESEARCHES

Wishing to place myself beyond the possibility of illusion as regards the fact of
deflection, I repeated the experiment with snccessive batteries of two, three and four
cells. The following are the results :â€”

IL.
2 cells. 3 cells. 4 cells.
Position 1. 450 439 425
Position 2. 462 450 437
Position 3. 473 462 448

In all the cases cited we observe the same result. From position 2 to position 1
the motion is from larger to smaller numbers; while from position 2 to position 3
the motion is from smaller to larger numbers.
