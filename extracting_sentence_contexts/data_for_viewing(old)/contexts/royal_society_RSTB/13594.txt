wise, forensic analyses of finger flutings in these caves also attest
the joint authorship of the hands of several individuals in the creation
of finger flutting panels [24].

"In Gargas for instance, the most common stencil is the one in con-
figuration ‘O’, i.e. one where all the fingers except the thumb are
absent (see figure 2). Notwithstanding, the cave displays large
amounts of Rugolean and Mirian finger flutings on ceilings, on
walls and within crevasses in the Lower Chamber, which require
the joint action of several fingers (cf. [8,54]).

“This hypothesis includes the possibility that some of the hand sten-
cils may represent numbers in a counting system. As a matter of fact,
beyond deaf populations, many speaking communities also employ
manual counting systems (cf. Brookes & Nyst [62] and references
therein). The counting hypothesis for Palzolithic stencils has been
independently suggested by Rouillon [60], who studies the possi-
bility that hand stencils in Cosquer may represent counting series.
Overmann [61], who studies stencils in Gargas and Cosquer as
expressions of a counting system, suggests that at least some of the
handshapes (those that present non-sequential extended fingers,
such as K, EF, B, C and G) may require a non-numerical interpretation.
“Alternatively, middle and ring fingers can be fully extended due to
the juncturae tendinum (e.g. in configurations with an immediately
adjacent ‘independent extensor finger’. Under this circumstance,
