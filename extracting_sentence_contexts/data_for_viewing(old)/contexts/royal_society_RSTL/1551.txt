any attachment whatever between any part of the body and
the including shell, by an organ appropriated to that office.
In consequence of this organization, the ocythoe cannot adapt
itself to the form of the cavity in which it rests, or secure
itself there s0 completely as the well known parasitic paguri
are enabled to do, in consequence of the: pliability of their
vesicular abdomen, and by the agency of their terminal hooks
or holders. Such observations seem to afford presumptive
evidence of the parasitic nature of these animals.

It does not appear to me probable that the Ocythos ascends
to the surface of the water by exhausting its $hell of the in-
cluded water ; for if this were the fact, those females whose -
$hell is in great part filled with eggs, could not visit the
surface. But the change of specific gravity is doubtless
effected in its own body, by which it is enabled to sustain
itself on the surface at will, or to descend to the bottom
promptly at the approach of danger.

The s$hells which in structure and appearance approach
nearest to argonauta, are unquestionably to be found in; the
Preropopa; and the examination of Carinaria, Atlanta and
Spiratella, would almost lead us to suppose, that the artificer
of argonauta is in reality of that division ; but if this suppo-
sition be indicated by the conformation of_the shell, it does
