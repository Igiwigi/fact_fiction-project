tents, with nine hours’ stale sperm, there was no diminution either of the blastulze
& the plutei.
= The somewhat variable results obtained are easily to be accounted for. Thus it
#ust be remembered that the sexual products were not from the same individual sea
chins as those from which the normal larvee were obtained. The stale ova and stale
7 were, of course, the same, but the fresh sperm and fresh ova with which
Ghey were respectively mixed, were from freshly opened, and therefore different,
individuals.

As staleness of the ova gives rise to larvie of diminished size, and of sperm to ones
of, if anything, increased size, one might be inclined to expect that when both the
products were stale, the larvae would within certain limits remain practically
unaltered. This was in fact the case. Thus in Exps. 139, 154, and 162, in which
both ova and sperm had been kept respectively twenty-two, twenty-two, and nine
hours before fertilisation, the larvee varied by respectively + 2°0, — 1°8, and — 3-4 per
cent. from those developing from the same sexual products when fresh. The arm
lengths were diminished by respectively 10°3, 5°5, and 1°9 per cent., or somewhat more

there was practically no diminution in the proportion of ova reaching the blastula and
