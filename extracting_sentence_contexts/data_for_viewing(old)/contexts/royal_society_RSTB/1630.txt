the lateral walls of the air-bladder, and even when these fibres are present the lyas of

As regards the effects of degeneration of the sir-bladder on the structure of those
portions of the internal ear which are specially related to the Weberian ossicles, wa
are satisfied that in, at least, some Silnridee abnormales the sinus endolympbatious has
completely disappeared, although the ductus endolymphatiens, ihe cavum sinus imparis,
anid the atrial cavities remain, and retain also their normal relations to one another
