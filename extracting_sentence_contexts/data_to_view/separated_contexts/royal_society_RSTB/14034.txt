The
same trade-off also maintains variation at a supergene
controlling heterostyly in Mimulus monkey-flowers [22].
4. Evolutionary dyn amics The social morphs have partially non-overlapping
geographical ranges in P. californicus, and completely non-
overlapping geographical ranges in L. acervorum [57,102-105]. While it remains unknown whether the social morphs are locally
adapted to their geographical ranges (in which case selection
could vary at a broad spatial scale), the fact that the two social
morphs are not in direct competition makes their evolutionary
maintenance easier to explain. In ants, the ancestral state is monogyny [91]. Polygyny has
evolved secondarily in many lineages [92], but reverse tran-
sitions seem to be rare.
