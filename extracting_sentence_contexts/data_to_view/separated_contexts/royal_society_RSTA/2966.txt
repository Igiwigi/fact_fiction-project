discuss the role of the sub-gap Andreev bound state spectrum in their original papers, the
anomalies in the current-phase relation of the Josephson point contact are reflections of the current
transported by the spectrum of Andreev bound states and the dispersion of the Andreev bound-
state energies with the phase bias across the weak link. In fact Andreev bound states play a central
role in all transport properties of Josephson weak links, but as will be discussed below and in §3,
their roles in charge and heat transport are fundamentally different. For a perfectly reflecting boundary with a small aperture of radius, a « §,,, shown in figure 4, : =
