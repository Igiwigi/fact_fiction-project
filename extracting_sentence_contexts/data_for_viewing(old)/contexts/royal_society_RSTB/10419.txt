that they ‘should’ perform.

A further variation on prediction-based theories of con-
sciousness is the attention schema theory [61]. In this case,
underlying consciousness is the process of attention,
which an observer initially attributes to an outside agent
in order to infer subsets of sensory information of rel-
evance to that agent, allowing the observer to adapt
their own actions. Consciousness is then seen as the results
of the ascription of such attentional states to the self.
Conscious experience optimizes both information differ-
entiation and integration. Following Edelman it is a
deeply significant fact that each and every conscious
scene is both highly integrated and massively differen-
tiated [2]. Tononi has further formalized this idea
through a range of increasingly more complex complex-
ity measures culminating in Integrated Information
Theory (IIT) and its ‘consciousness index’ ®, expressed
in bits [18,62]. As a dynamical measure of network com-
plexity, © seeks to operationalize the intuition that
complexity of brain functions results from simultaneous
differentiation and integration of information by the
underlying neuronal circuits and signalling processes.
Differentiation refers to the existence of specialized neur-
onal populations with distinct functionality, while
