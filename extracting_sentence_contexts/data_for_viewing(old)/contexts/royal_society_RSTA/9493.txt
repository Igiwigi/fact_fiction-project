If we compare the values of R//R in different years, we see that while on the whole
it was least in the years of fewest sunspots, it was considerably below average in
1893, the year of sunspot maximum. In the case of H, in fact, it was lower for 1893
than for any other year except 1900. This means tliat in 1893 R was specially large,
and not that R’ was small. As Table XXXVIII. shows, the mean value of R’ for
1893 was 15 per cent. above the average of the 11 years, and was exceeded only in
1892 and 1894. In the case of V the value of R’/R for 1893, though less remarkable,
was below the mean. In both H and V the values of R’ for 1892 and 1894 were
much in excess of that for 1893. For 1892 this excess was 21 per cent. for H, and
33 per cent. for V.

Table XLI. shows the order in which the years stand when placed in descending
order of range. Data for D are included to make the survey more complete. The
