value of this ratio, and consequently in that of , for a given variation in 3, is greater
when the arc is greater, that is, when > is less.

Thus, towards the blue end of the spectrum, where 2 is least, the dispersion or ex-
pansion of the rays is greatest.

But we must proceed from these very general remarks to the more precise compa-
rison of numerical yalues.

Comparison of Numerical Results.

In proceeding to apply the formula to actual calculation, we are met by several
difficulties arising out of the peculiar form of the function. The process is, in fact,
reduced to finding arcs which shall fulfill the #w9fold condition of being themselves
in the ratio of the values of 7, while they are to their sines in the ratio of the values
of p. For this I have not been able to make any direct method available.

By indirect and tentative methods, however, and the assumption of arcs which
were seen (from a table of the lengths of arcs,) to be nearly in the required ratio to
their sines, I advanced by successive trials of greater or less arcs to more exact
values. Those for the two extreme rays were usually assumed in the first instance,
and their ratios to their sines compared with the ratios of the refractive indices ;
and these once brought to a sufficiently near accordance, a fundamental arc was
obtained, from which those for the other rays were deduced on dividing by the
corresponding yalue of Aa; and the product of a constant coefficient multiplying
