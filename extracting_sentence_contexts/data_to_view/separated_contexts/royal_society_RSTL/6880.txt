This
deficiency in the thickness of the ventricular wall, which, during the dilatation of the organ and the first stage
of contraction, ensures great freedom of motion, is prevented from operating injuriously during the latter stages
of contraction, by such portions of the musculi papillares as are situated at the apex plaiting into each other 80
as entirely to obliterate the apicial cavity. + It is a great mistake to imagine that all the fibres of the ventricles arise from the auriculo-yentricular
tendinous rings, the fact being that, with the exception of the fibres of the first and 8eventh layers, they are con-
tinuous beneath them. These rings are more fully deyeloped anteriorly than posteriorly, and the ring which
belongs to the left ventricle is stronger than that which belongs to the right. IN THE VENTRICLES OF THE VERTEBRATE HEART.
