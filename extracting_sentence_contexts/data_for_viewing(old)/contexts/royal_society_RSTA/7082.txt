Assuming that the rate of advance of steps is independent of orientation (x,>x)), one can
choose a value for 7, ~ 0-2 such that most of the experimental results are contained between
the rate of growth (47) of a single dislocation (continuous line in figure 9) and the linear
law (50) (broken line in figure 9). Taking 7, ~ 0-2 and y/kT'~4, we deduce from (48),
x,~ 10°a for I, at 0°C, which is in reasonable agreement with what we should expect
(cf. I, equation (6)).

Nevertheless, one notices that the experimental rates of growth for the lowest super-
saturations are below the theoretical curve (47); in particular, the rate of growth at

og = 3-8 x 10-3(AT = 0°-037)
is < 10-5 times the rate of growth given by the linear law. The reduction given by formula (47)
is only a factor /a, ~ 5 x 10-* with respect to the linear law. This fact could be explained
in a number of ways:

(i) Itis an obvious corollary to our view of crystal growth that it is susceptible to poisoning
by traces of impurity, particularly at low supersaturations at which the number of

dislocations producing growth is smallest. From this point of view new measurements of
the rate of growth would be very welcome.

(ii) There may bea critical supersaturation of the type (51) of the order of 7, ~ 10-2, and
