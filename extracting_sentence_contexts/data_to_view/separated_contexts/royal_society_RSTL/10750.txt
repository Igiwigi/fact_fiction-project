This is an apparently sudden change, for we have it in the lowest or teatless
Mammals ; their ancestry, that should show us the earlier steps of the change, are,
nufortunately, all extinct.

pharyngobranchial ” element of the 2nd postoral arch, to speak


10 MR. W. K. PARKER ON THE STRUCTURE AND

In this dilemma nob only Zoology, but way” also, fails us utterly, but
Embr mes in with every stage and every link. otra foan out the early Sentned of these parts in several kinds of Marsupials,
and in the young of Ornithorhynelus ; but even in the lower Eutheria, the Edentata,
now to be described, and in the large and varied group of the Insectivora, T have
been able to trace every step in the transformation of these parts. I am now satisfied bhat the incus is the upper element of the firs or mandibular
arch ; both Professor SALENSKY's and Professor FRASER's researches put this, I think,
beyond doubt ; and my own attempts, for a long time, to make the hyoid theory of
this part agree with facts, only kept the subject in hopeless confusion. The new elements of the ear-chain are, then, the arrested quadrate or incus, and
the arrested and amputated articular region of the articulo-Meckelian rod, or primary
lower jaw. The bony part of the *ramus” is the well-known dentary, with the
coronoid and splenial bones in a 8ub=distinet 8tate ; the cartilage for the new articu-
lation of the lower jaw is derived from a large superficial 8lab—a lower labial ”—the
like of which is not found again until we get as low down as the Chimeeroids.
