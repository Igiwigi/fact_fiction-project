It was of interest to determine whether desensitization was improved by the addition of
capillary active substances. Turkey red oil gave an insoluble lead salt, and was therefore less
suitable for subsequent chemical destruction and the composition, than saponin or ‘per-
minal’ (essentially the sodium salt of an isopropyl naphthalene sulphonic acid).

The wetting of lead styphnate in bulk was found to be accelerated by both saponin and
perminal; the wetting of lead azide is more difficult, but accelerated wetting by aqueous
solutions was observed after adding 0-1 % perminal.

Little difference was found in sensitiveness to grit friction when these surface active
solutions were used for spraying, instead of water or water + glycerin. This is probably due
to the fact that thin layers of composition are in any case very rapidly wetted.

To investigate this point, the active ingredient from solid perminal was extracted with
acetone, and recovered by evaporation. Tubes of gutta-percha and of glass (0-6 and 0-3cm.
diameter respectively) were filled with 3cm. of initiator. The bottom was placed in the
aqueous solution, and the time for the solution to creep up to the top was measured.
Comparative tests show that the rate of creep through lead styphnate is accelerated some five-
fold in glass by the addition of 0-1 % by weight of the active ingredient of perminal to the
glycerin + water solution. Similar acceleration is observed in the case of azide. With gutta-
percha tubes no creep occurs without perminal.

The practical conclusion is that this addition facilitates the desensitization of azide and
styphnate to grit, even in bulk, by speeding up wetting.
