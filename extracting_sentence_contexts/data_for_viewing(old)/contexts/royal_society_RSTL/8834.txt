(A) If the stomach has been tained in gold and hardened in chromie acid, many of
the epithelial cells covering the surface will be found to contain nuclei in a state of
division (ﬆe fig. 27, Plate 42)*. Tt is noticed that the division does not seem to take
Place according to any strict law, as some of the nuclei are divided transversely, some
longitudinally, and some obliquely.

* This preparation is from the colon of the rabbit; the appearances are yery similar to those in the stomach.

(B) In preparations hardened in chromie acid, small cells are found at the base of the
epithelium. This fact was described by Topp and BowMAN (32), who seem to have
thought that a second layer was always present. F. F. ScuvLzE (98) (Taf. x. fig. Vi.),
EpsTElN (95) (fig. i.), and BLEYER (99) have also described small cells at the base of the
epithelium.

These cells are of two kinds :—first, Iymph-corpuscles similar to those which have been
described among the epithelial cells of the intestine (see fig. 28, Plate 42); and secondly,
rounded or conical cells which are only found at the base of the epithelium (se figs.
29 and 32)*, These latter cells have a faintly granular protoplasm, and contain spherical
nuclei which are not readily stained by hematoxylin. These cells may therefore be distin-
guished from the lymph-corpuscles, which have been already described as consisting of
a small clear zone of protoplasm surrounding a very deeply stained spherical nucleus
(compare fig. 28 and fig. 29). x
