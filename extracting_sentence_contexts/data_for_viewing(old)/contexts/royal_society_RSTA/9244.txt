between the mercury and platinum thermometers with rising temperature was found,
although the steam observations were not consistent with this. In order to find whether
any change had taken place in the calibration of the thermometer, some measurements
were made on a thread of length about 50°C. If the calibration corrections of the
Bureau International apply, their use should obviously give an unvarying length to
the thread. Using these corrections, however, the apparent length of the thread in
the region 0-50° C. was 0-017° C. greater than in the region 50-100° C. The calibration
correction at 50°C. was therefore reduced by 0-009° C. and the corrections between
0 and 50° C. were changed proportionately.* The broken thread observations, which
were taken on the travelling microscope of the Metrology Department, are shown
in detail in Table IX.

An estimate was made as to the magnitude of the error introduced by the fact that
on the average about 0-7°C. of the mercury column was emergent during all the
observations. In the hypsometer one of the Tonnelot thermometers was replaced by
a small maximum thermometer, which was supported in an inverted position with just
the bulb (about 1 cm. long) exposed. The reading recorded was 94° C. We may take
it, therefore, that the temperature of the emergent column of a Tonnelot thermometer
is not lower than 94°C. and is probably considerably higher. Taking, therefore,
94° C. and assuming 0-7° C. emergent, we get about 0-0007° C. as an upper limit to
the emergent column error. Hvidently, then, all errors due to stem exposure will be
quite negligible.
