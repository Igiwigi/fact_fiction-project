Though this pressure was first deduced as a consequence of the Electromagnetic
Theory, Barrorr showed, independently, that a pressure must exist without any
theory as to the nature of light beyond a supposition which may perhaps be put
in the form that a surface can move through the ether, doing work on the radiation
alone and not on the ether in which the radiation exists. Professor LArmor* has
given a proof of this pressure and has shown that it has the value assigned to it
by MAXWELL, viz., that it is numerically equal to the energy density in the incident
wave, whatever may be the nature of the waves, so long as their energy density for
given amplitude is inversely as the square of the wave-length. We may, in fact,
regard a pencil of radiation as a stream of momentum, the direction of the momentum
being the axis of the pencil. If E is the energy density of the pencil, U its velocity,
the momentum density may be regarded as E/U.

If the stream of radiation is being emitted by a surface, the surface is losing the
momentum carried out with the issuing stream, and is so being pressed backwards.
If the stream is being absorbed by the surface, then it is gaining the momentum and
is still being pressed backwards, the forces being in the line of propagation.

As the expressions for the radiation pressure in various cases are probably not very
well known, it may be convenient to state them here for use in what follows.
