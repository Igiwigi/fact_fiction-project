‘As soon as the Monkeys were killed, the uterus, with part of the vagina, the tub

The vagina is a wide sac with very thick muscular walls, much folded on the
inner side and lined with a thick layer of squamous epithelium. Projecting into t
vagina at the further end of the sac is a small papilla, in the centre of which is
small hole leading into the cervix of the uterus. The lips surrounding this hole a
