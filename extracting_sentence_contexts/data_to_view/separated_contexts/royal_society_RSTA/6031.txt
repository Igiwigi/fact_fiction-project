Such an invariance is still valid for V 4 0 if the
dilaton potential is a constant, or is a function of the variable ¢ (or, more generally, it is a function
of some O(d, d) scalar formed with M and @). Also, the scalar-factor duality of the previous section
can be recovered as a particular case of O(d, d) transformation. In fact, let us consider a pure gravi-
dilaton background with B =0, and a global transformation generated by the particular matrix
n € O(d,d). We have

_({G o ~ OT a _({G 0
u=(% :) and M=2 ma=nin=(f ou). (2.33)

so that G> G=G", ie. the considered transformation simply produces an inversion of the
spatial part of the metric. For a diagonal isotropic metric, in particular, G = —a7I, and the above
equation is equivalent to the scale-factor duality transformation a> @=a’.
