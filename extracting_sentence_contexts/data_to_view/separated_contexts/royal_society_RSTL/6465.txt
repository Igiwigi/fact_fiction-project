moving about a fixed point without assuming the principle of virtual velocities, and is in
fact a very simple deduction from D'ALEMBERT'S principle. + Ss

Let O# be the instantaneous axis, about which the body is rotating n
at time # with an angular velocity s. Let be a particle of the body, |= -
let its mass be m, its distance from O 7, r, and its velocity v in the
direction 17. Suppose now a force P to act at m.
