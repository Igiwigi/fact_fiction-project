ROBERT MATLET ON VOLCANIC ENERGY.

that hell, and in amount is dependent not 80 much on how much is received from
below as on the amount, of contraction of the material of the nucleus, which is, of
course, a function of its total loss of heat in all ways. As the pa thus developed
unequally by compression at different depths may vary, we at once obtain an explanation
of what has been observed at Dukenfield shaft and elsewhere (namely, discontinuity in
the serics of heat increment), and perceive how a warmer or a colder couche may be inter-
polated. In fact we bave a real source of perturbation distinct from difference of con-
ductivity and presence of percolated water, which alone engaged Mr. HoPk1Ns's attention:

76. But the evolution of heat within the solid shell by the variable compressibility of
the superposed formations thereof does not end with the compressions of the material
of each or all the beds. £

Any two superposed beds, such as Q and $S' in fig. 6, exposed to the same compressing
force, as they have unequal coefficients of compressibility, must slide upon each others

and 80 produce frictional and disintegrative work between the sliding surfaces ; this also
becomes transformed into heat, and further tends to raise their own temperature and
those of adjacent beds.
