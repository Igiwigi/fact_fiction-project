In particular, although
not evident from the coarse-grained approximation given in equation (3.7), the conditional
state |Yy(to,o,A))t represents the galaxy in coordinate time t as being spread over a small
interval around f = +tc. In fact, a more accurate expression for |Yy(to,,A))t is a superposition
of two Gaussian-distributed kets centred on the times t= +t, and each one with a variance in
time of

where 4 and @ are given by equations (3.5) and (3.10), respectively [10]. The fact that the galaxy
is represented by |Yn(to,0,A))t as localized in time is a sufficient objective basis to support the : 2
subjective perception of existing at a ‘present’ moment at time te. Moreover, in the previous : >
section we found that each conditional state | Yy(to, 0, 4)), contains, in general, physical evidence :3
of time evolution prior to f¢, and this provides an objective basis for contemplative human a
observers within the galaxy to perceive recalling the ‘past’. In other words, whenever the galaxy : <
exists as represented by |Yy(to, 0, A))t, contemplative human observers could perceive the present a
moment and recall the past.
