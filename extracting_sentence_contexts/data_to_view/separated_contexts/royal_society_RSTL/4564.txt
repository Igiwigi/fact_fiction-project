An extension of this study to the bases of the cinchona bark and
of opium, and to the bases of the series C, H,.,, N O, (glycocine, sarcosine, leucine, &c.),
whose constitution is at present till very enigmatical, may perhaps lead to similar
results, These substances, complicated as their construction may appear at the first
glance, will perhaps be found of a surprising simplicity when subjected to a closer
examination. I may here quote the curious results which various chemists have ob-
tained by treating with nitric acid and other powerful agents several of the natural
alkaloids, results from which it would almost appear that several of these alkaloids,
brucine and narcotine for instance, do actually contain methyl or ethyl, inasmuch
as their decomposition seems to give rise to the formation of compounds of these
radicals. The presence of such radicals as methyl and ethyl in natural alkaloids, is
in itself scarcely a startling fact. We are till perfectly in the dark as to whether
the pyroxylic spirit which we obtain in the dry distillation of wood is actually a
product of destructive distillation, or whether it pre-existed in the wood before the
process. At all events we know from the splendid researches of M. Canours on the
oil of Gaultheria procumbens, that methyl-compounds are actually secreted in the
organism of plants.
