The observed channelling of energy along the three diagonal lines in figure 1a
suggests that kz = 0 modes continue to play a key role in mediating the nonlinear energy transfer
in strong turbulence. It is important to note that, for an Alfvén wave collision with x ~ 1, the
self-consistently generated k, = 0 modes rise to amplitudes with the same order of magnitude as
the primary Alfvén waves, so pre-existing energy in k, = 0 modes is unnecessary to yield a strong
cascade of turbulent energy. In summary, the anisotropic cascade of energy in incompressible MHD turbulence is a
consequence of the two facts that only counter-propagating Alfvén waves interact nonlinearly
and that the nonlinear term is greatest for interactions between perpendicularly polarized Alfvén
waves. Note that this explanation of the anisotropy in terms of the linear and nonlinear properties
of the turbulent fluctuations differs substantially from a statistical argument in this theme
issue [67] relying on the coupling of third-order to second-order correlations in the turbulence. It
is an open question why the property of anisotropic energy transfer appears to persist under less
restrictive plasma conditions than incompressible MHD (in particular for the dispersive modes at
scales below the ion Larmor radius) which allow for co-propagating modes to interact nonlinearly.
