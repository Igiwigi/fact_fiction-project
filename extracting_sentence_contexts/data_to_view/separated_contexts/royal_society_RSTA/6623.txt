If m,ne H, and if n has a finite R-basis, N,(m; 1) = ®,.N(m;n). Under the
same conditions

N(m;n) = N,(m;n),

where p runs through all maximal ideals of R.°

Proof. It is clear that N(m;n) ¢ N,(m;n), and in fact that R,.M(m;n) < N,(m;n), the
latter being an R,-ideal. On the other hand, consider any @,8 such that mR, >, . («),
nk, © R,. (8). There exists we R such that m2 R. (ua), uA0mod p; because n has a finite

R-basis, there also exists ve R such that om SR. (8), vAO mod p.
