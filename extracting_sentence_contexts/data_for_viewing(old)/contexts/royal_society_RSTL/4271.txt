be formed, the prolongations of sarcode issuing from the seyeral pores of the pre-
ceding zone coalesce, s0 as to form a complete zone of segments and connecting
stolons around the margin of the previously-formed disk; and that the deposit of
calcareous matter forming the shelly walls of the cells and passages, takes place upon,
or rather in, the superficial portion of this zone of sarcode. But I cannot find any
evidence in the ordinary growth of the disk, that the sarcode extends itself over the
surface of the portion previously formed ; although occasional appearances will be
hereafter described (4 53), that seem to indicate that it may do 80.

21. It is a fact of much importance in the due appreciation of the relations of
Orbitolite and its allied forms to other tribes of Foraminifera, that the calcareous
partition which separates each cell of any one zone from its neighbours on either
side, is not double, but single. And this is in great part the case, even with regard
to the partitions that separate the cells of successive zones ; the inner or central
boundary of one being chiefly formed by the peripheral wall of the other. It is not
easy even in thin sections to distinguish the boundary between the walls of one zone
and those of another, s0 absolutely continuous do they appear to be. But it not
unfrequently happens, that in fracturing these disks, their component zones come
apart from each other, along their natural] lines of junction, s0 as to disclose the real
inner (or central) margin of the onter segment, which then presents a set of wide
apertures, through which we look at once into its cells; thus proving their incom-
plete enclosure by proper walls on that side (Plate V. fig. 1, f). Thus in the forma-
