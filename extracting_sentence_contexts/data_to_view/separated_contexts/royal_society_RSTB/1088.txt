Paths. I. CENTRES,

Functional Activity of Centres. As regards Centres, the position assumed in the introduction* is, we believe, as a
matter of fact, tacitly in the minds of observers, if not admitted, and the influence of
“basal centres” is not so overwhelmingly important as originally supposed by the
older observers. To conveniently combine, therefore, the results without doing
violence to the theoretical views expressed by anyone, it is only necessary to arrange
the facts in relation to the part which is the seat of experimental investigation. A. Cortex.
