The vascular bundle in the
apex of the leaf resembles that of the Cycad petiole or leaflet, where there is only a
trace of secondary wood, or none. This recently demonstrated occurrence of true
centripetal xylem towards the apex in Araucarian leaves makes their association with
Cordaites in internal structure, as well as in external form, a very intimate one. This view of the centripetal xylem is held in spite of the fact that JErFREY in
his work on Cretaceous pine leaves does not consider the tracheary tissue opposite the
protoxylem in the living Conifers to be centripetal xylem. He says (1908, p. 218):
“Tt seems much more highly probable, from the conditions observed in Prepinus and
in species of Cretaceous Pinus, that such elongated elements with bordered pits are
in reality vestiges of the ancestral inner transfusional sheath (of Cordaites), the real
centripetal xylem having disappeared at too early a stage to be represented even
vestigially in living Conifers.” Fusm, on the other hand, has recently called
attention to some of the anomalies of the centripetal xylem of Prepinus.
