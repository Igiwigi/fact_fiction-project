It is further shown, that whatever title to polarity the deportment of a bar of soft iron,
Surrounded by an electric current, and acted on by other magnets, gives to this sub-
stance, a bar of bismuth possesses precisely the same title; the disposition of forces
which, in the former case, produces attraction, produces in the latter case repulsion,
while the repulsion of the iron finds its exact complement in the attraction of the
bismuth. Finally, we have a case adduced by M. Mavrevccr which suggests a
crucial experiment to which all our previous reasoning has been subimitted, by which
its accuracy has been proved, and the insufficiency of the assumption, that the dia-
magnetic force is not polar, is reduced to demonstration. When we remember that
against all this no single experimental fact or theoretic argument+ which can in any
