in its results, but it did not seem worth while to undertake the amount of trouble
involved in such a search, The formula can be successfully used for the purposes of
interpolation within the field of observation, but any use cf it for extrapolation would
be hazardous.
We may now write the equation for V* as

V? = 1681 pu — 785,300,000 , 317,700,000 | 3,114,000,000

This formula has been obtained as the result of four consecutive approximations,
and it is possible that each succeeding approximation has led us further from the
facts. On the other hand, it is conceivable that the errors of the various approxi-
mations have to a large extent neutralised one another. It was thought advisable
therefore to test the above formula by calculating out the isothermals, and comparing
them with the observed measurements. The result is shown in fig. 4; and it is
easily seen that the calculated isothermals may be fairly taken as a system of smooth
lines passing through the observed points.

From the equation to V* we obtain
