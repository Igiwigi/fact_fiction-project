Acass1z Atlas, the
resemblance of both phenomena will at once be perceived. The glacier ice, like the

compound, I think it may be predicted that it will destroy the longer undulations. For the present I will
avoid speculation upon this subject, and confine myself to facts. If we examine the list of solid substances
whose power to transmit radiant heat instantaneously have been examined by MeLLoxr, we find that those
at the lower end of the list, that is, the most imperfectly diathermanous substances, all contain hydrogen. In no single case, where this element occurs, is the substance capable of transmitting rays from a 8ource of
752% Faur. ; while in every case where it does not occur, the power of transmitting rays from this source is
manifested in a greater or less degree.
