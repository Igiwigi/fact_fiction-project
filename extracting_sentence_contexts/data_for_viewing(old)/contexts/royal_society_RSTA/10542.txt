OF THE FLAME IN THE EXPLOSION OF GASES. B45

Many of the photographs show what appears to be a definite inferior limit to the
flame in its initial phase, e.g., figs. 46, 59, 63, and 64, as if the flame died out
promptly. We attempted to explore the dark region left inside the flame by passing
sparks through it. But no effect whatever was produced in the photographs—doubt-
less because the gases were still burning. Indeed, most of the photographs show that
the region is only comparatively dark.

I would draw attention to the fact that when no sound-waves interfere with the
flame, the retonation-wave is very brilliant ; when the flame is crossed several times
BS by reflected waves, the light is more evenly distributed. Nos. 63 and 64, taken under
@the same conditions, illustrate this fact. The phenomenon is explained on the
Bascumption that in the region traversed by the flame the gases are still burning, and
‘§ the sound-waves, when they enter this region, bring about an increase in the rate of
@ combination. They are, therefore, of the same nature as, but differ in degree from,
4 the wave of retonation. The more intense the compression-wave, the more rapid the
= combustion in its path, and the more rapid the cooling in its wake.
=) The “kick-off” which the explosion gets when the gases are fired near one end of
sa tube considerably modifies the initial progress of the flame, especially when this is
E comparatively slow: compare fig. 66 where the spark is passed af the end of the
E tube, with fig. 67, where the spark is passed 4 inches from the end of a similar tube.
6 For this reason the experiments made on the time required in different gases to
xg develop the detonation showed anomalies which only disappeared on firing the gases
3 by means of wires which just penetrated through the stopper at the end of the tube.
