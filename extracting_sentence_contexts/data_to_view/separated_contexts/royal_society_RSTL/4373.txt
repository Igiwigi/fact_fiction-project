Tre degree to which the phenomena of Life are dependent upon Physical agencies,
has been a subject of inquiry and speculation among scientific investigators of almost,
every school. That many of the actions taking place in the living body are con-
formable to the laws of mechanics, has been hastily assumed as justifying the con-
clusion that all its actions are mechanical ; and hence arose the iatro-mathematical
doctrines, which obtained considerable currency among the physicians and physio-
logists of the seventeenth century +. In like manner, the fact that many of the

* The author thinks it due to himself to state, that the inquiry whose results are embodied in this paper
has been occupying his attention for some years; in proof of which he may cite the following passage from a
review of Prof. MaTTevccr's © Lectures on the Physical Phenomena of Living Beings,” contributed by him to
the © British and Foreign Medico-Chirurgical Review ” for Jan. 1848 (p. 235);—* There can be no doubt that
the present tendency of scientific investigation is to show a much more intimate relation than has been com-
monly supposed to exist between vital and physical agencies; and to proye that, whilst the former are of a
nature altogether peculiar, they are yet dependent upon conditions 8upplied by the latter. And the more
closely these phenomena are investigated, the more intimate and uniform does that dependence appear; 80
that we seem to have the general conclusion almost forced upon us, that the vital forces of various kinds bear
the same relation to the several physical forces of the inorganic world, that they bear to each other; the great
and essential modification or transformation being effected by their passage, s0 to speak, through the germ of
the organic structure, somewhat after the same fashion that heat becomes electricity when passed through cer-
tain mixtures of metals,” Of the paper communicated by Dr. FowLe to the British Association at its last
meeting (September 1849) under the title—** If Vitality be a Force having Correlations with the Forces, Che-
mical Affnities, Motion, Heat, Light, Electricity, Magnetism, Gravity, 80 ably shown by Professor Grovs to be
modifications of one and the same Force ?
