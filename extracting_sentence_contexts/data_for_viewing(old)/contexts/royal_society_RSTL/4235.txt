high water does not differ much from the sun's hour-angle at the time of solar diurnal
high water. The assumption of any constant difference, either =0 or having any
assigned magnitude, reduces two of the unknown quantities to one.

The number of unknown quantities is thus made the same as the number of data,
and the solution can therefore (speaking in a strictly algebraical sense) be effected,
in general.

The following is the method by which the equations for the four unknown quanti-
ties may most conveniently be formed :â€”

From the ordinary facts of the tides, it seems probable that the coefficient of lunar
diurnal tide may depend on the moon's declination at a few days, perhaps not
exceeding five, anterior to the time of the tide. Let 4 be the moon's declination at
one day preceding the time of tide, d, the moon's declination at three days preceding
the time of tide. Then we may express the coefficient of lunar diurnal tide by
p.sin 4 +9g.sin d,; where by varying the proportions of p and g the coefficient may
be made to depend on the moon's declination at any day near them ; and by varying
the magnitudes of p and q in the same proportion, the magnitude of the coefficient
will be altered in that proportion.

The coefficient of solar diurnal tide may be represented with sufficient accuracy by
r.8in D,, where D, is the sun's declination one day preceding the time of tide.
