NUMBER OF RUNS OVER SAME TRACK

film was present on the surface the coefficient of friction during the first run was low and
equal to 0-1, The actual trace obtained during this first run is shown reproduced in
figure 14a (plate 4) and a photomicrograph of the track formed on the lower surface
is given in figure 14Â¢. Continuous sliding was taking place between the surfaces and
there was very little wear; the behaviour was, in fact, very similar to that found when
excess stearic acid was present on the surface. However, on repeated running over the
same track, the friction soon began to rise and eventually attained the high value
characteristic of unlubricated surfaces. At the same time the wear betweeen the
surfaces was increased enormously, and the appearance of the track after twenty runs
is shown in figure 14d. It is clear that as a result of the repeated sliding the protective
film is rapidly worn off the lower surface, and that as this film is removed the seizure
between the surfaces increases, the friction rises, and a marked tearing of the lower
surface begins to take place.
