facts, and by the extent to which it satisfies the various conditions of the problem. Another objection may be raised on the grounds that the thickness of the Earth’s
crust is such as to render the movements spoken of improbable ; but there again the
physical data upon which that thickness has been estimated depend upon observa-
tions of such extreme delicacy that they scarcely yet afford a sure basis for calculation,*
whilst the geological facts are antagonistic to the great thickness and rigidity contended
for. No conclusion can, at all events, be correct which does not satisfy the geological
as well as the physical conditions.
