a category error to call such people ‘sceptics’.

In the tumult of voices that can arise in such disputes, the media—print, radio,
TV—are often unhelpful, for two reasons. First, their primary aim, which is not at
all unreasonable, is to get your attention—to be read, listened to, watched. Only
secondarily do they aim to inform; indeed, they cannot hope to inform if they do
not attract your attention. Second, the media’s praiseworthy desire for ‘balance’ in
reporting too often leads to presenting ‘two sides’ as if reporting a soccer match.
But this can, and often does, seriously misrepresent the state of the scientific
evidence, where ‘one team’ is the consensus view of the science community and the
‘other team’ is a tiny minority. For example, consider the debate about whether
HIV causes AIDS. A research community of order 100 000 has by now established
this as a fact. But a small travelling roadshow, including one Nobel Laureate, can
still be assembled to deny it. And there are many other examples: from MMR
vaccination in the UK to the essential reality of anthropogenic climate change
(albeit with remaining uncertainties about the timescales and magnitudes of some
nonlinear processes).

Furthermore, it is often difficult to make an accurate assessment of risks,
and even when an accurate assessment can be made, many people’s subjective
assessment is very different from the objective facts. Such subjective attitudes
can create their own reality and impede effective policy actions.

Even a policy of ‘label and let the consumer choose’ has its problems. For
one thing, there is a question of individual risk versus collective risk (e.g. an
