The SED describes language fea-
tures of 313 locations selected for geographical spread and
representativeness, from across England, some parts of Wales,
the Isle of Wight and the Isle of Man. These locations were
chosen, not because it was thought that there was some definite
number (e.g. 313) of English dialects, but rather to ensure a rela-
tively even spread geographically and across established
administrative county entities in England. Labelling these as ‘dia-
lects’ is based on the fact that no two of the 313 locations produce
an identical combination of variants for the hundreds of linguistic
variables included in the SED. Therefore, each variant combina-
tion is unique to a particular one of the 313 geographical
locations and can be regarded as belonging to and identifying
each of these geographical locations. (Although it would be
more appropriate to refer to the speech sample at each location
as a ‘lect’, we use ‘dialect’ herein for the sake of convenience.)
The aim of the survey was the elicitation of archaic, ‘lexical features
... in the form of ... phonological variants ... and grammatical
features’ [26, p. 45]. In this survey, the researchers took as their
target population ‘men and women, sixty and over ... because
they were considered to be more likely to best preserve the
traditional dialect; [and therefore] ... the questionnaire [used in
the SED, was] ... constructed for the farmer’ [26, p. 44, 46].
