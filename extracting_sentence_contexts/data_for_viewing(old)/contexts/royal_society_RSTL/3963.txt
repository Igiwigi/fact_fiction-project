354 MR. GROVE ON THE GAS VOLTAIC BATTERY:

The result of the above experiments gives, I believe, the first instance. of the ein-
ployment of a solid, insoluble non-conductor as the excitant of a continuous voltaic
current ; it proves that the existence of diffused phosphorus in nitrogen, as noticed
by the old experimentalists, is not a consequence, as was once believed, of a, partial
combustion, but of an effusion continuing as long as the preyiously diffused phos-
phorus is abstracted, and it gives the very curious result of a true combustion, the
combustible and the © comburant * being at a distance; phosphorus burned by oxygen
which is separated from it by strata both of water and gas, of an indefinite length.
This result, arrived at by a progressive series of inductions, scarcely now appears ex-
traordinary, but would have been in all probability listened to with incredulity if simply
stated as a fact a few years ago. By the galyvanometer we may also ascertain the
rate of this very slow and minute chemical action; thus if by an apparatus, as above
described, my galvanometer gives a deflection of 8 degrees, I know that the phos-
phorus is being consumed at the rate of the seyen millionth part of a grain per
minute.

(34.) The next step was to ascertain whether this action was peculiar to nitrogen
or common to other gases ; for this purpose, a day or two after the first experiment,
was $et aside, the following were also made, and the dates and results were as fol-
lows :—

No. 1. Phosphorus suspended in protoxide of nitrogen associated with oxygen :
weight of phosphorus 5:3 grains. Charged August 11th, 1844.
