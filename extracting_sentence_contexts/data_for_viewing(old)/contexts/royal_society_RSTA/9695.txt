show a less value. The generality of the rule is striking, but a further discussion
must be postponed until the atomic weight terms are considered. It does not, of
course, affect the question of the atomic volume terms considered above, as the
reasoning there is based on the first terms of the series, in which N retains the normal
value. It may be noted that this change of N gives the ratio au~! = ‘21520 for all
the elements, and explains why the rule to deduct W(1—m-7?) always failed for the
elements of large atomic weight.

The Principal Series —No principal series were known in the 2nd and 3rd group
of elements until PascuEn* discovered those of Zn, Cd, Al, Tl and suggested certain
lines in those of Mg, Ca, and Hg. Those for the first four were clear and definite,
and little doubt could be felt as to the correctness of their identification as a whole.
The same certainty cannot be felt as to those for Mg and Ca, and, in fact, I give
below certain considerations which tend to throw doubt on some of them. The first
definite observations of the HgP are due to Mriner,t who gave the lines of orders
5 to 16. For 5 to 8 he gave values for P, and P, but, as later work of PascHEn has
shown, he allocated the P, lines to the real P, and his P, lines do not come into the
direct line of the series, although it is possible they may be collaterals. Since then
Pascuen} has published a long list of lines observed by WrepMANN, and has attempted
