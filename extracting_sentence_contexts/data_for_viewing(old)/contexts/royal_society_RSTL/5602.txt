very translucent, losing at the same time its reflective power : it looks very like the film
of chloride produced when a leaf of silver is placed in chlorine gas. When examined
by a lens or an ordinary microscope, the leaf seems to be as continuous as in its original
state; the finest hole, or the finest line drawn by a needle-point, appears only to prove
the continuity of the metallic film up to the very edges of these real apertures. When
pressure is applied to this translucent film, the compressed metal becomes either opake
or of a very dark purple colour, and resumes its high reflective power. If a higher heat
than that necessary for this first change be applied, then the leaf, viewed in the micro-
cope, assumes a mottled appearance, as if a retraction into separate parts had occurred.
At a till higher temperature this effect is increased ; but the heat, whether applied in
the muffle or by a blowpipe, which is necessary to fuse the metal and make it run
together in globules, is very much higher than that which causes the first change of the
s1lver: the latter is, in fact, below s8uch a red heat as is Jjust visible in the dark. What-
ever the degree of heat applied, the metal remains as metallic silver during the whole
time. When many silver leaves were laid loosely one upon another, rolled up into a loose
coil, introduced into a glass tube, and the whole placed in a muffle and heated carefully
for three or four hours to 80 low a degree that the glass tube had not been softened or
deformed, it was found that the silver-deaf had sunk together a little and shaped itself
in some degree upon the glass, touching by points here and there, but not adhering to

it. But it was changed, $0 that the light of a candle could be seen through forty thick-
nesses: it had not run together, though it adhered where one part touched another. It
Uid not look like metal, unless one thought of it as divided dead metal, and it even
