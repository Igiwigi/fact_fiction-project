The organ is situated not far from the mouth, and is directed downwards. It ap--
pears to be supplied by a separate nerve sent off from the supra-cesophageal ganglion,
and I have ascertained, by repeated experiments, that it is the most sensitive part of
the body ; since, while the mechanical irritation of any other parts excited only a
slight movement in the limbs of the animal, when out of water, and somewhat feeble,
the touching of this part was immediately followed by a violent and almost spasmodic
flapping of the tail. These circumstances, together with the situation of the organ,
appear to point it out as intended possi√æbly for the purpose of testing the quality of
the food; as in fact an organ of smell, evidently endowed with an exquisite sensi-
bility ; but in the absence of other analogies I would be understood as offering this
rather as a conjecture, subject to correction by further examination and experiment. I may add, that I have not observed this organ in any other than the two species
Jjust noticed. But it is to the true organ of hearing that I would more particularly direct atten-
tion.
