we would accordingly answer the first alternative in our third question in the affirmative.
Moreover, quite apart from that evidence, it seems altogether unlikely that in such
early developmental stages there should be two distinct and unrelated centres of
mesoderm formation, one for the exoccelomic mesoderm and another for that of the
connecting stalk primordium.

Coming to question 4, if we are correct in assuming that in Tarsius the hinder end
of the primitive streak is the first part to become active and that from it the exoccelomic
mesoderm is produced, then we need have no hesitation in homologising the caudo-
median proliferative area in the Pithecoids with the precociously differentiated caudal
extremity of the primitive streak in Tarsius, even if that area should cease its pro-
liferative activity before the primitive streak is completely differentiated and in spite
of the fact that it involves amniotic as well as shield-ectoderm, since the participation
of the former is obviously secondary and the result of the evolution of the amnio-
embryonal vesicle, and in spite of the further fact that it produces connecting stalk
as well as exoccelomic mesoderm. All we need assume is that the developmental
acceleration which is evident in the precocious activity of the hinder end of the Tarsius
primitive streak has manifested itself here also in the Pithecoid and in still more
exaggerated form.

Finally, as concerns our last question (5), although we know of no lower mammal
with a comparable caudo-median proliferative area, it is perhaps of interest as evidence
of the potentialities possessed by the mammalian germ to recall that Parrerson
(Â°18, p. 594) has described in the early blastocyst of Tatusia the proliferation of extra-
embryonal mesoderm from the embryonal ectoderm of the amnio-embryonal vesicle,
