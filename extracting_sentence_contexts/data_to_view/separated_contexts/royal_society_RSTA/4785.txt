So is a more recent development, based on the Bern—Carrasco-Johansson (BCJ) relations
and colour-kinematic duality [39]. nee)

However, it is also notable that the development of the determinantal formula has tied in :
closely with insights from the twistor-string perspective. Mason & Skinner’s [34] derivation of [4
the gravitational MHV amplitude came from a twistor Lagrangian approach, and this perspective DN
has been maintained in the more recent work following up the determinantal formula. The work =
of David Skinner [40] goes back to the twistor-string picture and in particular brings in the :B
remarkable fact, which so far has not been much exploited, that twistor geometry can represent de ,
Sitter or anti-de Sitter space just as well as Minkowski space. The only modification necessary is
that the ‘infinity twistor’ becomes non-degenerate. This non-degenerate Iyg fits elegantly into
a determinantal structure.
