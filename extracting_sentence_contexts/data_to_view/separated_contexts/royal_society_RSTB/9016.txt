the efficiency of bead-to-bead transfer of CHO cells showed A general problem with this type of cell transfer is the fact
that collagen, fast attachment collagen-treated and different that a high percentage of microcarrier aggregation and multi-

dex and Cytopore carriers [48]. On another side, diploid cells, heterogeneity within the aggregates. This is probably not optimal
like human fibroblasts, are completely unable to perform bead- for routine processes [46], although when producing recombi-
to-bead transfer [24].
