‘constant in a stream of dry air. One portion of the deposit was then heated to
redness in a current of dry hydrogen, and another portion was dissolved in nitric acid,
jand the silver precipitated as chloride, Although in these experiments no extra-
ordinary precautions were taken, the results agree in showing that to 1 part in
1000 the deposit on the anode is pure silver, and it gives, therefore, no support to the
idea that secondary reactions have occurred. So far as we know, the only observation
of a similar kind to those given above, was made by Kauux,* who found that on
boiling silver nitrate with silver oxide the amount of electrolytically deposited silver
increased by 5 parts in 10,000, The explanation of these results with the old
ution is at present unknown, although most of the facts point to the formation of
3 sub-salt of silver having a heavier silver ion than an argentic salt. E
