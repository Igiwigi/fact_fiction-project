Some kink bands
crosscut the entire grain and create new path to accommodate the deformation imposed by the
local stress field. Kink band sub-structures are however more numerous close to grain boundaries
than within the grain (figure 2c). This is consistent with the fact that the strain incompatibilities
are stronger close to grain boundaries. When going deeper into the grains, the sub-structures
therefore tend to arrange in simpler shapes with reduced stored energy. Isolated tilt SGBs and multiple tilt SGBs that result in progressive bending of the crystal lattice
(electronic supplementary material), or more complex mosaic sub-structures formed by multiple
tilt SGBs (grain P8, figure 3) are also frequently observed in our samples.
