Further differentiation of the regenerated graft tissue and
complete absorption of the dead core. A fuller account of these autografts will be given in a later report. But two other facts
are relevant here:

(1) graft survival time is, for practical purposes, indefinite,

(2) a small number of lymphocytes and even fewer pyronin-staining cells were found
in most of the graft series; the number of lymphocytes appeared to reach a peak at 16 days
and thereafter to fall off. The number of grafts on which the above description is based was not less than six
(representing six different rabbits) at any stage.

(ii) Homografts transplanted to non-immunized animals (‘first set’ grafts)

The features which differentiated these grafts from the autografts were as follows:

Fourth day. There was some indication of a stronger vascular reaction in the average
homograft than in the autografts.
