Hence, models capturing nearby levels (i.e.
quantum descriptions of chemical systems) will thereby be amenable for model reduction and
mapping between state variables. This view is also consistent with the emergence of new
phenomena at one level not perceivable at another level, such as the example of the concept
of temperature. This elementary observation together with the existence of physical laws is the
basis for the fact that a system in nature allows a shorter description than the system itself. Further supporting this perspective is the crucial derivation by Noether [49] that there exists a
conservation of an entity whenever there is a symmetry in the system. This has been exploited
and extended in physics, essentially leading to a global constraint on which states a system
can visit, hence an effective reduction in complexity.
