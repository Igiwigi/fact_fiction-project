After the discovery of W8 EPR centre [11], the : =
milestone experiments in the identification of Nis were (i) the fingerprint of Â°!Ni isotope in :8
the EPR spectrum with the hyperfine interaction between the electron spin and I = 3/2 nuclear : =
spin in isotopically 61Ni enriched HPHT diamond samples [12] and (ii) observation of S =3/2 :8
electron spin with hyperfine signals of four identical 13C I = 1/2 nuclear spins [13]. The W8 EPR [3
centre exhibits an isotropic g = 2.0310 + 0.0005 tensor. These facts imply that the defect has Ty [8
symmetry. Furthermore, S = 3/2 spin state indicates that it is a substitutional defect in the negative : 3
charge state, i.e. Ni; .
