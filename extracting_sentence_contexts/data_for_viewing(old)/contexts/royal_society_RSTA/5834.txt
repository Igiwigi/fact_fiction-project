to the equivalence theorem of field theory [71,72], allow for the quadratic-in-(gravitational-
)curvature terms in the low-energy string effective action to be cast always in the (ghost-free)
Gauss-Bonnet form [67-70], which, in four space-time dimensions, is a total derivative. Hence,
for constant dilatons we are considering here, such terms will not contribute to the action. Since
an H* term is of the same order as terms quadratic in curvature, this leaves the CP-violating
Chern-Simons anomalous gravitational terms as the sole contributor of H* to the vacuum energy
density in our model through the aforementioned GW-induced-condensate mechanism.

We stress once more that the condensate (3.2) involves integration over graviton degrees of
freedom, and, as such, it is a consequence of (weak) quantum-gravity effects. We also remark
[44] that the crucial for inflation H* term in the RVM energy density (3.18) is missing in both,
the quantum field theory example of a non-minimally coupled scalar field considered in [40]
and the Starobinsky inflation [5]. In fact, we remark for completeness that the latter is based on
H ~ constant, rather than H ~ constant, which is the case of the RVM inflation [33].

4. Post-RVM-inflationary eras

Chiral fermionic matter and radiation (gauge fields) are assumed to be generated in our model at
the end of the RVM inflationary epoch, as a result of the decay of the RVM vacuum [43-46]. The
corresponding effective action for chiral fermions is obtained in a similar manner as its bosonic
counterpart (2.8). The torsion interpretation of the field strength Hy», of the antisymmetric-
tensor field dictates the Presence [46] of a linear interaction between the axial fermion current
PY =D fermion species Wir y" wh and eyrpgH'?’, which, upon implementing the Bianchi identity
constraint (2.6) via the Lagrange multiplier KR axion-like field b(x), and integrating out the Hyvp
field strength in the path-integral, leads to the effective action with fermions [46]:
