Such a wave will emanate from each lip of the channel, F\? being given by (28) and F®
being deduced from the fact that the resulting potential from the two waves is symmetrical
about the centre line of the channel. Thus, considering the interval 0<6<z and remembering
that ;? does not penetrate into the region 41<0<n, we find that the contribution to the
potential outside the channel is
