or changing the values of w and z, we have

a(yw—az)+,=0
for the equation of the scroll $(1, 1, 3)*,

* It is 80mewhat more convenient to change the sign of z, and take a(yw+z)+y*=0 as the canonical
form,

34, The Hessian of the form is a*, and it thus appears that the plane z=0 is a deter-
minate plane through the double line. But 4=0 is not a determinate plane; in fact,
- if for y we write y+ az, the equation is
—#2+aw(y+22)+(y+MxY=0,
that is,
—#(2=aw—3Ky—e)+ay(w+3r)+4*=0,

which, changing 2 and w, is still of the form a(yw—az)+5=0.

The planes 2=0, w=0 will alter with the plane y=0, but they are not determined
even when the plane y=0 is determined; in fact we may, without altering the equa-
tion, change w, 2 into w+0y, 2+0x respectiyely,

- 35, In the equation a(yw—az)+y*=0, writing y=az, we find for the equations
