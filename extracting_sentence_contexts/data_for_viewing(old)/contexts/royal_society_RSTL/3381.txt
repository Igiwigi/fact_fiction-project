Twenty years have passed since the Society honoured me by printing my first
paper on the functions of the nervous system. It is thirty years since I circulated a
$hort essay, in which the idea of the new principle which has guided me in my inqui-
ries into this subject was pointed out. The Society will acknowledge that since
that time, investigations into the nervous system have been prosecuted with a success
strongly in contrast with that attending the inquiries during the long period of some
hundred years, in which a false hypothesis had satisfied the minds of the medical
profession, and chained down physiologists in inactivity.

In 1821 I had made s0 much progress in these investigations, that I was encouraged
to present my first paper to the Society, as no longer the expression of mere opinions
founded on experiments too delicate to be generally appreciated, but demonstrations
of substantial facts, easily proved to be correct, and such as the Society has always
sought to encourage. After the principle had been once established by anatomy
and experiment, that the nerves possess distinct functions in correspondence with
their origins from the brain and spinal marrow, time and opportunity were alone
wanting for collecting the pathological facts which were to give importance to the
observations in these early papers. Those facts I am now desirous of placing before
the Society, to complete the subject as far as regards my own labours.

First in regard to

The Spinal Nerves.

In the earliest part of my investigations I performed experiments on the roots of
