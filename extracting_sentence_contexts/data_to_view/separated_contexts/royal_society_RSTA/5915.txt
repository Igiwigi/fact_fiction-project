Here, the
saving propensities of all the agents are chosen from a uniform distribution which is the simplest
one. Although in this work, we are actually interested in the dynamics of a tagged agent, the
behaviour of overall distribution of wealth P(m) is also of great importance. The overall wealth
distribution shows the Pareto exponent to be roughly 1 as in the case of the conventional CCM
model [21,22] except for the fact that near my, there is a sharp change in the profile. This behaviour
can be understood by studying an individual agentâ€™s wealth distribution which will be addressed
in the next section. The wealth distribution P(m) is shown in figure 1 for Model A (a) and Model
B (b) for two different m,.
