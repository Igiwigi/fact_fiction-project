ought too few to measure. In the next cross, made in the middle of August, the
Sea-urchins were in bad condition, owing to the very high temperature of the
Seiuarium tank water. Perhaps this may have been partly the cause of no larvee
ing obtained, and only very few of the ova undergoing segmentation. Thus even
the normal direct Spherechinus fevtilisations failed to give any plutei in two out of
the three experiments made. In the next series of experiments, made in November,
hybrids of the Strongylocentrotus-intermediate type were largely in excess of these
of the Spherechinus type. Thus, on an average, only 16 per cent. of the larvee were
of this latter form, and they were, moreover, much smaller than those previously
obtained, they being 11°2 per cent. smaller than the pure Spherechinus larve. In
all the cross-fertilisations subsequently carried out, during December and January,
the Spherechinus type of hybrid was entirely absent. We therefore observe the
striking fact that whilst in the summer months most of the hybrid larve are of the

maternal type they in most cases become modified to the paternal type in the autumn,
and in the winter the paternal type is the only one represented. As will be shown
later on, this remarkable change of type probably depends on the relative degrees of
maturity of the ova and sperm from which the hybrids are produced.

With regard to the Strongylocentrotus type of hybrids as a whole, we see that they
are always considerably smaller than the pure Stronyglocentrotus larva, the difference
