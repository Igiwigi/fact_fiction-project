Discussion. Pairing and Linkage of Chromosomes. Several notable facts regarding the pairing and linkage of chromosomes in these
hybrids have been brought to light. â€˜The first is with regard to the differences found to
exist between the two reciprocal hybrids. Although the chromosomal constitution of
these two hybrids is the same, yet differences in morphological structure and cytological
behaviour are evident. When Oe. ammophila is the pollen parent, each chromosome of
the two groups which are brought together finds a mate, with which it becomes paired.
