measurements. The upper end of the quartz fibre was fixed to a graduated torsionâ„¢
head. To the lower end was attached permanently a short length (about 7 or 8 mm.)
of moderately thin glass fibre, to which the crystals could be attached readily.+ The
glass fibre being very short, and much stouter than the quartz fibre, the torsion of
the whole suspension was that due to the latter alone. The torsional constant of the
suspension was determined by oscillating from its end a circular dise of glass, about
one of its diameters.

The attachment of the crystal to the fibre, so as to make any specific direction in the
crystal vertical, was a matter of some difficulty, and had to be adjusted by repeated
trials. A short focal length telescope fitted with a graduated eye-piece scale, which
could be rotated through any known angle about the axis of the telescope tube, served
for measurements in connection with the mounting of the crystal. In fact, with the
help of the torsion-head for measuring rotations about a vertical axis, the graduated
circle of the telescope for rotations about a horizontal axis, and the eye-piece scale
for linear displacements, all the necessary adjustments and measurements on the
crystal could easily be made.

3. Results.

Before proceeding to describe the experimental results, we explain the notation
adopted in the paper.

In the case of magnetically uniaxial crystals, the gram molecular susceptibilities
along and perpendicular to the axis are represented by z and y, respectively. In
