* The route over the clay lowlands east of Shotover Hill was probably stopped by the Portlandian and

Cretaceous rocks, more recently breached by the Thame. Rocks of this age still modify to a considerable
extent the course of the Thames at Nuneham.


146 W. J. ARKELL ON THE

cannot be more than a mile wide is proved by the occurrence of Coral Rag in the
exposures N. of Common Platt and W. of Moredon. Light is thrown on its southerly
extension by the deep boring at the G.W.R. works at Swindon, in which the highest
22 ft. of the Corallian consisted predominantly of clays ; in fact, it is only when viewed
in this light that the record of that boring becomes intelligible [44, No. 158, pp. 85, 86].
Here, then, as at Littlemore, the continuity of the coral reef was interrupted by a long,
narrow channel filled with muddy sediments, and the most reasonable explanation
seems to be that through this channel the waters of a stream found their way to the
open sea from the land to the 8.E.

After studying the gap of the Thames at Sandford and that of the Ray north of
Swindon, it was natural to seek to account in the same way for the next important gap
in the Corallian escarpment, that utilised by the G.W.R. main line at Wootton Bassett.
Here, it may be observed, the Lower Calcareous Grit is absent, and the Oxford and Kime-
ridge Clays were mapped by the Survey as in contactâ€”a complete failure of the Corallian,
which seemed inexplicable. Unfortunately no good exposures now exist at this important
