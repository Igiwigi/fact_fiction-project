It appears, then, that though the equilibrium theory, taken in combination with
the preceding considerations, may very probably give us the general form of the

terms, and the variable part of the ares on which they depend, the constant epoch
which occurs in each of these arcs, and which determines when the inequality
vanishes and reaches its maximum, will probably have to be determined in all cases
by observation.

1 will observe further, that not only the epochs, but the coefficients of each of these
terms will probably have to be determined for the most part from observation. For
the tides, though in the theory to which we refer considered as representing positions
of equilibrium of a fluid, are in fact the results of its motion ; and it is not at all clear
that the elevation which results from the motion will be equal to the elevation which
would be requisite for equilibrium. It is true that there must be always a tendency
to this equilibrium-eleyation $0 long as the actual elevation is greater or less than
that ; but this tendency may never fully appear in the circumstance of the tide ; since
the tide-producing forces haye to supply also a residue of force which must be em-
ployed in producing the motion of the fluid.

Moreover, the motion of the fluid is of the nature of an oscillation, so that series
of increasing and diminishing oscillations at interyals of a half-day, a day, and other
intervals, pass through any given part of the ocean. Now it is physically, not only
possible but certain, that each oscillation in each series is affected by those which
precede it in the same series, and affects those which sncceed it, 80 that their relative
