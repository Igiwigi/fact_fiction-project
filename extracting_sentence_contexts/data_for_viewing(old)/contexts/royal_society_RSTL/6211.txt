Thus in Table 74,—the formula for H(«U +68HU),
and in Table 75,—the formula for P (24YU—2PBZU ),
each of them involve the same factor :

d,(1, 0, —248, ..s, BY.U
l—6d.(1, 0, —248,..'X«, BY. HU,
and $0 in all the other cases.

248. The quantics in (&, Þ) in each part of the foregoing Table 73 are covariantively
connected together. Tn fact, considering the function (1, 0, —248, .. Ye. BY, which
for shortness I call G, we have

G=" (1, 0, —24S, ..Ye, BY,
TE=0
JG = 4(648%—T*)=4R,
oOG= (IG). —27(JGY=—432R?,

oG="  2(T;. 968%, :. Te, BY.
The last-mentioned formulee, by the aid of Table 72, give rise to the following more
general system in which they are themselves included,
