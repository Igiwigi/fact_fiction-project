5, a); and in the eleventh the metapophysis (m) sud-
denly shoots upwards and forwards, the anapophysis (a) diverges from it backwards,
underlapping the metapophysis of the next vertebra, and both processes far snrpass
the diapophysis (4) in size, which clearly, however, coexists with them. It disap-
pears in the thirteenth vertebra, in which both ana- and met-apophyses have in-
ereased in length; and the only question that remains with regard to the * trans-
verse process ' (4) of the following vertebrz is, whether it includes the diapophysis
at its base, or consists solely of the connate pleurapophysis. The eleventh vertebra
permits of no doubt as to the distinctness of the diapophysis (4) from the two larger
superadded processes (32 and a), and, in fact, a rudiment of the diapophysis may
be recognized above the costal pit in the last dorsal. Fig. 6 shows the prozygapo-
physes (=) existing, as in all the anterior dorsals, independently of the metapophyses#:
