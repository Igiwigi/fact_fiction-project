lettered in sequence. Like results as regards double glide were obtained with our silver
and nickel crystals, the curves for which are likewise marked with arrows at the sym-
metrical position. A similar behaviour was noted earlier by Sachs & Weerts (1930) on gold
and silver alloys and by Osswald (1933) with copper and nickel alloys. (Figure 6 in
Osswald’s paper shows, for a copper-nickel alloy, a typical course of the wire axis, during
glide, in the standard projection.) Figure 8, plate 1, shows the typical low magnification
appearance of glide packets in a heavily strained gold crystal and figure 9, plate 1, the
appearance, at high magnification, of a gold crystal in which triple glide has taken
place.

The surface of the unstrained gold crystals shows, at high magnification (x 1800),
a laminar structure of which an example is given in figure 10, plate 1. The curvature
of the lines is due to the fact that they are intersections by the (100) planes of lamellar
growth with the surface of the specimen, in which small surface irregularities are imposed
on the general cylindrical form, The average spacing, as measured in the photograph, is
about 1-54, the actual separation of the privileged planes being about 14. This is roughly
the same as the separation of the planes of the substructure discussed by Graf (1942) and
by Andrade & Randall (1950), who showed that the planes were revealed, but not caused,
by strain. Earlier, Straumanis and Stranski and his collaborators established a natural
spacing of this order for hexagonal metals (for references see Andrade & Randall 1950).

Silver

The silver was Messrs Johnson and Matthey’s spectroscopically pure metal, containing
less than 10 parts in a million of impurities. The crystals were prepared by the method
