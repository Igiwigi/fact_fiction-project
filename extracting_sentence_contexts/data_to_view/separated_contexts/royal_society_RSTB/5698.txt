For it can be seen from the diagram (fig. 9) that they must have been invaded
whenever the second primordium was displaced towards the wound, as it was usually
found to have been, though less far than after isolation of I,. Moreover, in the first
group of isolations of P,, in which the amounts of stipular area left on the apex were
greater, the displacements of I, were also usually distinctly greater (see Table I), and
so also on the average were the angles between I, and I,. This difference may, however,
not have been due to the fact that in the first group more of the stipular area of P, was

left on the apex. The explanation may be that the cuts, being closer to the central part
of P,, presumably did not extend so far up the apex above P,, and so allowed the stipule
of I, to extend farther into the region above the wound.
