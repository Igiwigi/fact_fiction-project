What is required is the elimination of the functional forms from these equations,
if this be possible.

Manifestly all the third derivatives of ¢ and @ disappear in the combination
a+f—g—h; in fact,

at+f—g-h=(a —b) oy — (4 —b, — 0, +05) bd, —-(¢, — bY) do.
+ (4 — y)0, —(@-y— 4 +7) 0 — (a — y) Oy.

If, by means of the expressions for 1, m, n, it be possible to eliminate @ and ob, we
must have a relation of the form

at+f—-g-h+&+ynm+M%=0,

where &, 7, ¢, do not involve 6 or ¢.
in order that the terms in #, and ¢, may disappear, we have
