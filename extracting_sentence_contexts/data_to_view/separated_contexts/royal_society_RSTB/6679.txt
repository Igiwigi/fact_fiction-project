The surrounding country
consists of low gentle hills of Oxford clay, largely covered with boulder clay, and so
disposed that they form a low ridge, close round the basin. They enclose a very small
river-catchment area, from which no streams of any size drain into the basin. This is a
feature of importance in interpretation of the vegetational history of the area, as is
also the low lime content of the boulder clay and the fact that the more calcareous
Jurassic strata (oolites, etc.) outcrop only west of the watershed. The region has been notable for the occurrence in it, until recent times, of several
large fenland ‘“‘meres”’ of which the best known were Whittlesey, Ugg and Trundle
Meres, with Ramsey and Benwick Meres not far to the east. These were all very
shallow lakes, of which fair historical records persist.
