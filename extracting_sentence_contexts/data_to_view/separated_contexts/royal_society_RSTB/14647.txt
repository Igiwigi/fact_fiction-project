Another challenge is that populations or communities
where parallel evolution is observed are not true replicates. Quasi-replicates vary at least somewhat in the environment
they experience and in their initial state (community struc-
ture, genetic composition of member species, population
sizes, etc.). On the one hand, the fact that parallelism is
observed despite these ‘extrinsic’ differences between quasi-
replicates suggests that evolution would have been even
more repeatable among true replicates. On the other hand,
extrinsic variation compromises our ability to interpret any
quantitative measure of repeatability. Specifically, if some
quasi-replicates did not evolve in parallel, it is unclear
whether the lack of parallelism should be attributed to the
intrinsic randomness and contingency of evolution or to the
extrinsic variation between quasi-replicates.
