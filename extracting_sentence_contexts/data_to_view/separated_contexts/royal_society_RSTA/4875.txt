We will see that they are indeed polynomials as a by-product of their computation. Furthermore, in all of
our applications, F will be monic. Furthermore, the denominator is in fact the discriminant of F, for, in characteristic 2, r + e =
(r,- ry. Following Berlekamp, we denote the numerator of Berl(F) by &(F), that is,

&(F)
disc F’

Berl(F) = (2.3)

Note also that, in characteristic 2, disc F = 5(F)*, where

a(F)=ay | i +7)

i<j

is a polynomial in the coefficients of F with total degree n—1, and degree at most d(n)=

{(n —1)/2] in ap—its leading term, as a polynomial in ao, is al V2 gn D2 for odd n, and
(2 1 (297 ? for even n. The formulae for Berlekamp’s discriminant for degrees up to 3 are

(b) Effective computation of Berlekamp’s discriminant

The formulae above do not lend themselves immediately to computations of Berl(F) or &(F)
in terms of the coefficients of F.
