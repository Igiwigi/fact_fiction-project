As the distance from the tip becomes of the order
of dendritic diameter p, a dendritic shape becomes in agreement with the shape (3.1).

(b) Three-dimensional dendrites

A novel computational method based on a multiscale random-walk algorithm was developed by
Plapp & Karma [18] to simulate three-dimensional dendritic growth. They showed that the scaling
law (3.1) must be changed in the case of three-dimensional axisymmetric dendritic growth by the
following formula:

zpx(x) = a|x|9/?, (3.2)

where all designations correspond to expression (3.1) and x represents the spatial coordinate of a
symmetrically growing dendrite. Physically, the scaling laws (3.1) and (3.2) are different due to the fact that the tip velocity is
much larger in the three-dimensional case than in the two-dimensional case. The latter is caused
by the fact that the heat- and mass transfer equations, as well as boundary conditions in 3D and
2D, have a different form, which is dictated by various Lamé coefficients [32,33]. To conclude this section, we stress the fact that the Ivantsov solutions work only at the
dendritic tip and in a very small vicinity around the tip, but the scaling laws (3.1) and (3.2)
determine the shape of the neighbouring area to the dendrite tip.
