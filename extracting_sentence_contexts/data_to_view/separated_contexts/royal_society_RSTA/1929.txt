To investigate the numerical properties of the present approach, the local
Knudsen number e¢, as well as the number of Newton-Raphson iterations are plotted in figure 8. Interestingly, the kinetic sensor € is only activated close to the aforementioned features, which
allows us to properly classify them in terms of departure from the equilibrium. This observation
serves as a justification for the fact that the adaptive BGK operator leads to stable simulations
through a local increase of the kinematic viscosity adapted to the flow features: high increase for
both strong and weak shocks, moderate close to the aerofoil, low in its wake, none in the rest of the
domain. This indicates that one of the possible outcomes of such a sensor would be a better control
over areas of the simulation domain where shock-capturing techniques, and/or subgrid scale
models should be activated. In addition, it is confirmed that the number of Newton—Raphson
solver iterations required to impose the correct 13 moments is relatively low.
