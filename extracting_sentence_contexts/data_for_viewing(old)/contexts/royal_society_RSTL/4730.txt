monthly increment or decrement to or from the maximum period is gradual, and

5 rarely checked or inverted. In Bombay the annual mean temperature for 1843 is
vB almost identical with that of Madras for 1843, althongh the two places differ 5* 41'
Z in latitude. The monthly means' of the two places correspond tolerably well from
Ss January until July; for instance, February corresponds within a tenth of a degree,
5 and June within two-tenths. But in July there is a difference of 3*79, August 3%31,
= September 3:16, Madras being plus: then the sign changes and Bombay becomes
> plus for the remaining months of the year, and also in January. The coldest month
= in Bombay was January, and the hottest May. In Bombay, in 1843 and 1844, unlike
= Madras, there is an inversion in the decrement of heat on the sun's going south ; for
5 October is represented as hotter than September in both years: a very remarkable
2 fact is exhibited by these hourly means, namely, that neither the south-west mons00n
S at Bombay, nor the north-east monso0n at Madras, at all affect the monthly mean
E. regular increment or decrement of heat, with the exception of October in Bombay.
= It will be observed that the maximum heat, both at Madras and Bombay, was not
[5 when the sun was vertical at either place passing to the northern tropic ; but
<= when the sun was near to the northern tropic in June, the mean temperature in
5 1843 at Madras, in lat. 13? 4, was at its maximum in July, while at Bombay, in
E lat. 18* 55', the greatest heat was in May of that year ; and though the sun passes over
S both places again to the south the mean temperature gradually declines in each year,
= with the exceptions noticed. I was desirous of inserting in the Table of Mean Tem-
5 peratures those for 1843 and 1844 at Calcutta, for comparison with the Madras and
A Bombay observations for the same year; but on referring to the volumes of the
