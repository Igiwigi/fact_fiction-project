Eliminating A, B... C, D we have an equation which determines z as a function of 9;
and the equations = determine the ratios of A, B... C, D, 8 that these quantities
will be given as determinate multiples of an arbitrary quantity M. The equation for z
is in fact

values which scem to be dependent on 0: if they were 80, it would be fatal to the success
of the process; but they are really independent of 0.
