rotula cells (black (dark) dots). However, living cells of the same species (green light squares)
deviate considerably, presenting significantly slower sinking speeds than those expected for their
size. In fact, the variability of compiled diatomsâ€™ sinking speeds (obtained from many species
in different physiological states [31]) is so huge (blue light dots), that we cannot reasonably
consider such a simple law to hold universally. Beyond geometrical effect (on viscous forces)
due to the diversity of cell shapes, this variability suggests active buoyancy regulation by the
cells depending on their physiological states [32], and therefore on the environment (light [33],
nutrients [34]) they are confronted with. In fact, it has been shown that diatoms have evolved different means by which to regulate
their density.
