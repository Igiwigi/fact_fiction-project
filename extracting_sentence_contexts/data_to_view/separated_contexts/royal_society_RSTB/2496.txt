Delicate staining with alum
hematoxylin, saffranin, or diamant-fuchsin and licht-griin always bring these nuclei out
sharply, and their regular co-existence in pairs in the terminal clavate segments of
the older hyphze, which are mobilising beneath the epidermis to form spore-layers, is
very striking (fig. 10). It may be added that the variations in colour produced by the fuchsin-green
method, seen on comparing, e.g., figs. 5-10, are due partly to the developmental
state of the hyphze and nuclei, and partly to the control of the successive stains ;
and the same is true of the difference in the colour brought out in haustoria and
cell-nuclei, &e.—cef. figs. 10-16 for instance. Too prolonged action of the green removes too much of the fuchsin, as a rule, a fact
of which considerable use may be made in producing sharp contrasts. Thus, the
cell-nuclei in figs. 1-3 and 15 are intense red ; whereas in figs. 16 and 16a they are
vivid green ; in figs. 11 and 16 the haustoria are bright green, but in fig. 16a they are
nearly pure red. In other cases intermediate hues due to less perfect replacement of
the fuchsin by the green are observable, e.g., figs. 4, 7, 11, and 12, &e, Beyond the
general statement that the more nuclear substance, or dense protoplasm there is in
the organ, the more tenacious it is of the fuchsin, I do not propose to lay stress on
these matters.
