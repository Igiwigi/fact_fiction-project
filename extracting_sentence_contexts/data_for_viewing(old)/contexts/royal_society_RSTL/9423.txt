«Tn the strafified discharges through rarefied gases produced by an induction-coil working with an ordinary
contact-breaker, the strie are often unsteady in position and apparently irregular in their distribution,

Observations made with a revolving mirror led me to conclude that an irregular distribution of striw does
not properly appertain to stratification, bub that its appearance is due to certain peculiarities in the current

Q © Having reason to think that the defects in question were mainly due to irregularity in the ordinary
Qontact-breaker, T constructed one with a steel rod as vibrator, having a small independent electro-magnet
or maintaining its action. The natural vibrations of the rods which were tried varied from 320 to 768 per
Sieetm, while under the action of the battery-current and electro-magnet they varied from 700 to 2500, or
ereabouts, per 8econd. The amplitudes of the vibrations were exceedingly xmall, in fact not exceeding
S01 of an inch; and i is to this fact, coupled with the extreme rapidity and consequent decision of make
Sand break, that T mainly attribute the steadiness of the results.
S * With a contact-breaker of this kind in good action several phenomena were noticeable ; but first and
.Foremost was the fact that, in a large number of tubes (especially hydrocarbons) the striw, instead of
ing sharp and flaky in form, irregular in distribution, and fluttering in position, were 8oft and rounded

hese results arc, T think, attributable more to the regularity than to the rapidity of the vibrations. And
.Uhis view is supported by the fact that, althongh the contact-breaker may change its note (as occasionally
happens), and in £0 doing may canse a temporary disturbance in the stratification, yeb the new note may
