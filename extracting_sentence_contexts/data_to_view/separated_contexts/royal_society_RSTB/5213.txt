It seems, therefore, that the periproct is, as a
tule, enclosed by plates 4a, 4b, 5a and 5b. In imagines in which only plates 2a and 2b
of the posterior inter-ambulacrum are present, it is possible that plates 36 and 3a,
the first two plates to appear after metamorphosis, may remain in contact with the
periproct. The variation in the position of the periproct may therefore be due to the
fact that some imagines are less advanced than others. When fig. 16, ©, of the present paper is compared with Lovin’s fig. 245 a striking
difference is at once apparent. In fig. 16, #, as already described on p. 309, the anterior
is much more advanced than the posterior half of the corona.
