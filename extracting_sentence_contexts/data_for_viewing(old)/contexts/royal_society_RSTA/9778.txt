specification is (abed...). So far it has not been feasible to directly determine an
expression for L,, but as we now know the expression for GF (/; a, b,¢,d,...) it is
possible to find expressions for L,, L:, L,, ..., by giving / the values 1, 2, 3,..., in
succession in the resulting identity. One interesting result was, however, directly
determined, viz. :—

L,(~ ; a, b)

=a wv (8 —s+1) — (a—1) (b—s+1)... (b) af; —g)4-g°7*t! (9
(1)... (8) Gj abi eee ee

but I do not give the proof of it at present, as the subject of the sub-lattice functions
has not yet been worked out, and they are, in fact, no longer necessary for this part

of the general investigation.

Art. 31. Valuable information, concerning line or one-dimensional partitions, is
furnished by putting J = 1 in the general formula.

The partitions that are then enumerated are those in which every part is unity,
there being not more than a, units in the s row; if thence we proceed to line
partitions by adding the units that appear in each row we clearly get a system of
line partitions such that the s part is limited in magnitude by the integer a,; or
the system comprises all partitions contained in or subordinate to (a, ds, ..., %), ViZ-5
such that the first part + a, the second > ay, ..., the n® > a,.
