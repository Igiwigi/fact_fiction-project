Tables of the real and imaginary parts of the function
are given to four decimal places, for values of |p| from 0 to 0-80 at intervals of 0-01, and for values
of arg p from 0° to 45° at intervals of 1°.

1. INTRODUCTION

The tabulation of functions for complex values of their argument is very seldom under-
taken. This fact is, perhaps, not surprising in view of the enormous increase of labour
involved when the argument has two degrees of freedom. It is, however, unfortunate that
the widespread use of the complex variable in mathematical physics cannot be more
adequately supported by numerical tables. The deficiency is particularly noticeable in
wave theory; here the complex variable is an essential tool, but both the relatively simple
form and the physical content of a result may be destroyed by the necessity of separating it
into real and imaginary parts for the purpose of computation.
