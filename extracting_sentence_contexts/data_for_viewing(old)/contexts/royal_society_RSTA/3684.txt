magnetite, Ca phosphates, organic-dominated grains, pyrrhotite and Ca-Mn-Mg-Na carbonates.
The very abundant carbonates have Mn-rich cores, mantles of Ca carbonate, and very thin Naâ€”
Mg-rich rims. The bulk oxygen isotopic composition of this clast plots in a unique place above
the terrestrial fractionation line, and has a very high A!7O value of +1.41 [67,68]. The Na-
rich rims of carbonates suggested a link between this clast and the halite in Zag, and indeed
careful examination of this clast using a field-emission gun scanning electron microscope (FEG-
SEM) revealed 10 pm-sized (Na,K)CI crystals, conclusively forging a link between this clast and
the larger halites in Zag and, probably, Monahans. Owing to the extreme care with which this
particular sample was handled, the halite is clearly indigenous to the clast and thus the Zag clast
and halite are linked.

Because both Zag and Monahans are H chondrite regolith breccias, it is logical to examine
other H chondrites (at least). In fact, a Cl-like clast has been reported in the Tsukuba H chondrite
[69], and the recently fallen Carancas H chondrite contains another [68]. The clasts in Tsukuba and
Carancas appear to be mineralogically identical to the Zag clast. We suspect that this material was
relatively widespread in the Solar System, but that its friability has generally prevented survival
in meteorites. The O isotope composition of the Zag clasts shows that it is not merely CI chondrite
material, although it is mineralogically very similar, suggesting similar formational history. These
clasts probably represent rocky, mantle samples of the halite parent body.

5. Ceres as the source of the meteoritic halite

We have direct observations of hydrovolcanism of several small Solar System bodies (e.g. the
moons Triton, Titan and Enceladus) [70], and indirect evidence for this process on the moons
Europa, Ganymede and Miranda, and the Kuiper Belt object Charon [71], revealing continuing
