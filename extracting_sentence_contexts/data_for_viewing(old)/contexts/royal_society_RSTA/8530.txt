This is the equation immediately preceding (B), from which the ensuing argument
follows as before—with only p + +« for tx, which is of no importance.
Thus our process is in fact valid for a much more general equation than that under
review. We continue, therefore, with equation (B), of the form

tediously.

Let it be called T, and write w= q—p. Then
