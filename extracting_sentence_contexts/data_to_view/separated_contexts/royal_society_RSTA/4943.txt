The situation is even worse : >
for a kinetic plasma. Multiplicity of variables and parameters also makes it difficult to envision [3
universality in MHD. There are in fact expected to be numerous types of possible turbulent : =

The role of advection in generation of intermittency seems fairly clear based on the several : 3
