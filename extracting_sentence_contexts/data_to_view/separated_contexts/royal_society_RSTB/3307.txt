Many of these facts give support to the view of the origin
in situ of the calcareous “coal balls.” * We also present facts in support of the
statement that they occur in more than one geological horizon ; experiments and
deductions showing the importance of the peaty acids and sea water in the preserva-
tion and fossilisation of the plant tissues in the coal balls, and the possible chemical
reactions which took place during the process of mineralisation. Further, a com-
parison is made between the type of flora found in the roof shales and nodules and
that in the seam, and their respective origins. Secrron IT,
