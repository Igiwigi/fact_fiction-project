The stress drops associated with an event can be seen to vanish in the
arrested scenario. Furthermore, not only is the original event stopped but subsequent events disappear, thus implying causality.

stress drop at roughly the 100K time mark and two distinct dips. The first dip is a single plastic
event and is our target for arrest while the second dip is in fact two events occurring in rapid
succession. We note here that plastic events occur on a small but finite time duration of about
5000 time steps. The solid line (black) line represents a simulation re-started from a checkpoint prior to the
target event and a successful arrest of said event (no stress drop).
