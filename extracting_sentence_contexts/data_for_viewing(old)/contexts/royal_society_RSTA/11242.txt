behaviour which is associated with the idea of stable groups.

Increase of temperature has been shown in the present paper to hasten recovery
from overstrain to a remarkable extent. This, as indicated by the quotation given
above, may be ascribed to a greater facility given by slight warming, to the breaking
up of the less stable groups, and possibly to the re-formation of more stable groups.

Violent mechanical vibration, however, seems to break up the rather more stable
groups, rendering the material more semi-plastic and hindering the recovery process.

That recovery from overstrain, or more generally, that the phenomenon of “ elastic
after-action,” is associated with complexity in the physical structure of the material,
is further borne out by the fact that a crystalline body, such as a quartz torsion
fibre, exhibits little or no after-action (in the form of zero-creeping) ; while a complex
body like glass shows such action in marked degree. An analogy to this difference
in the behaviour of material, according as it is simple or complex, is found in the
phenomenon of the residual charge in the Leyden jar. Condensers with pure dielec-
tries such as sulphur, quartz, air, exhibit little or no residual charges ; while with
complex suhstances like glass, gutta-percha, caoutchouc, the phenomenon is par-
ticularly observable.
