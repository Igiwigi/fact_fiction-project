the action of ultra-violet light on a negatively electrified zine plate, or consists in the
Eescape of electricity from a pointed platinum wire. It is not only in their efficiency
aus condensation nuclei that the carriers from the first three of the above-mentioned
Bsources agree, for RurHERFoRD has shown that their velocity in an electric field of
&he same strength is almost identical.
Further, these carriers are by no means of the nature of dust particles, for unlike
Athe latter, which require only an exceedingly slight supersaturation in order that
condensation may take place on them, they do not act as centres of condensation
unless the vapour i§ about 42 times as dense as that in equilibrium over a flat surface
of water at the same temperature (vide ‘Phil. Trans.,’ loc. cit.). In the paper just
referred to the number 8°6 X 10-* was given as an approximate value of the radius
in centims. of water-drops equivalent in their action to these nuclei. The nuclei are
therefore not much larger than molecules; the fact that dense condensation takes
place with a supersaturation only twice as great when, as far as can be judged, no
nuclei are present other than the molecules of vapour and gas, is further evidence
that the nuclei with which we are here concerned are not very large compared with

It is, perhaps, of some interest to calculate what charge would be required to keep
