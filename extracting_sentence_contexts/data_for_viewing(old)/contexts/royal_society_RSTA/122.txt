equations for water waves. In Escher (2007), the existence of weak solutions to
he DP equations in the periodic case is of interest, special emphasis being placed
also upon the wave-breaking phenomenon. The paper by Lenells (2007) is
devoted to a detailed classification of the travelling waves for both equations. It
urns out that, in addition to peakons, both equations admit also travelling
waves with cusps, as well as a multitude of peculiar waves obtained by combining
peaked and cusped wave segments into new fractal-like travelling wave solutions.
The contribution by Beals et al. (2007) deals with aspects relating the string
density problem to the integrability of the CH equation, while E] Dika & Molinet
(2007) analyses the stability of multi-soliton solutions to the CH equation.
Finally, the paper by Kolev (2007) discusses the connection between the CH
equation and the geodesic flow on the diffeomorphism group of the circle. This
geometric aspect is deeply connected with the fact that the least action principle
1olds for the CH equation (cf. Constantin & Kolev 2003) and explains from a
geometric perspective the bi-Hamiltonian structure of the equation.

The paper by Johnson (2007) presents a field survey of edge waves and offers
several ideas about future directions for research on these intriguing water
waves. These waves were originally considered to be a curiosity (Lamb 1932),
but are now recognized to play a significant role in near-shore hydrodynamicsâ€”
especially in relation to sediment transport (Komar 1998). Edge waves are waves
that progress along the shoreline, with an amplitude that is maximal at the
shoreline and decays rapidly offshore. This manifestation of water waves offers a
plethora of very intriguing phenomena awaiting further studies.
