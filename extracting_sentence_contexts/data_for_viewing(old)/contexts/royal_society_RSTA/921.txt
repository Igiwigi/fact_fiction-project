Rigorous proof of coherence loss uses quantum core postulates (0)-(iii) and relies on quantum
facts 1-3:

1. Locality: A unitary must act on a system to change its state. A state of S that is not acted upon
does not change even as other systems evolve (so 1s @ (ley Xe] + ele) \(e)|) does not
affect S even when S and € are entangled, in |Wse).

2. The state of a system is all there is to predict measurement outcomes.

3. A composite state determines states of subsystems (so the local state of S is restored when the
state of the whole S and € is restored).

These facts help to characterize local states of entangled systems without using reduced density
matrices. They follow from quantum theory: locality is a property of interactions. The other two
facts define the role and the relation of the quantum states of individual and composite systems in
a way that does not invoke density matrices (to which we are not entitled in the absence of Born’s
Rule). Thus, phase shift ug ® 1e = (| Tt | + | LL |) @ Ie acting on a pure pre-decoherence
state matters: measurement can reveal g. In accord with facts 1 and 2, ug changes a| t) + A] |) into
a|t) +e” B| |). However, the same ug acting on S in an entangled state |se) does not matter for
S alone, as it can be undone by 1s ® (let er| +e” ley Ney), a countershift acting on a faraway,
decoupled €. As the global |Ws¢) is restored, by fact 3 the local state of S is also restored even if
S is not acted upon (so that, by fact 1, it remains unchanged). Hence, the local state of decohered
S that one obtains from |s¢) could not have changed to begin with, and so it cannot depend on
the phases of a and p.
