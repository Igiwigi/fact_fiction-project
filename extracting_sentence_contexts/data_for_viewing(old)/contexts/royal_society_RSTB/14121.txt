Figure 3. Moral judgements of overt and covert use of voice transformations. Top row: overt use. (a) The moral acceptability of overt vocal transformation was
higher than the neutral midpoint, and therapeutic transformations even more so than transformations used to enhance user capacities. (b) Situations in which
transformations aimed at weakening the two negative emotions of anxiety or anger were better accepted than situations in which transformations aimed to enhance
smiling. (c) Across situations, acceptability was positively associated with the participants’ familiarity with science fiction. Bottom row: covert use involving lying
about the true purpose of the transformation in order to improve its effectiveness. (d) Participants considered it morally acceptable that the user of the trans-
formation hides its true purpose to others but hiding the transformation to the person using the device was totally unacceptable. (e,f) The acceptability of lying to
the person using the device was negatively associated with the participants’ concern with fairness, and positively with purity. (a,b,d) Across conditions, there was no
effect of whether the user of the device was the participant or an unknown other. Error bars: 95% confidence intervals. (Online version in colour.)
