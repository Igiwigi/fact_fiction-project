Information
stored in the non-randomly ordered nucleotide triplets
(codons) [19-21] forms the basis for the genetic code. Only
this code allows DNA sequences to be scanned, decoded and
interpreted by the translational machinery, to be converted
into amino acids in a process that enables relocating inherited
information into proteins, another set of elementary biological
buildings blocks. The genetic code is perhaps the most illustra-
tive example for the fact that yielding useful information from
data always requires a functioning data decoding system. Inter-
estingly, this information transfer from DNA to protein is
highly dynamic. For example, identical proteins can be syn-
thesized with different molecular energies if the same amino
