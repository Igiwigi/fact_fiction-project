of conjunction, stimulate the motor cells upon the opposite side as well as upon
ir own side. The commissural fibres also probably aid in this. But, in as much as
fits are abolished after immediate section, we must assume that, using absinthe,
@ power of transmitting impulses from one side of the grey matter to the opposite
‘side requires a short time for its development.
_ Professors GotcH and Horstxy obtained with intense stimuli a slight response on
the side of immediate section, but with ordinary stimuli no effect. They explain it
spkowise upon the supposition of a heightened reflex.
= 1 may here point out the phenomenon of the increased reflex after hemisections
rrerved by Brown-SéQuarD.
‘5 When a motor area or one hemisphere is removed, or a complete hemisection made in
te quadrigeminal region, there are bilateral fits, in spite of the fact that the opposite
Byramid is completely degenerate.
4 The fits wre modified wpon the side opposite to the lesion, the clonus being less
Barked the first fit may be absent or very small.
Ss = We have shown reasons for explaining these phenomena by the presence of direct
Bierl pyramidal fibres derived from the sound pyramid, for, if after a hemisphere is
moved and degeneration has taken place in the opposite pyramid, a hemisection is
Bu on the side of the degenerate pyramid, it instantly arrests the fits wpon that side.
"BI therefore conclude that the maximal effect of absinthe is produced upon the cells
3 the motor area, and that the impulses generated there are distributed by the
‘Pyramidal system in the way described.
€ But I will not state yet that this is the sole explanation in the cat, seeing that the
Erect lateral pyramidal tract is so very small.
