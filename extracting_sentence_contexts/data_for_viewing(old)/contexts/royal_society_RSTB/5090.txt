The cheek, in the fish, is composed of a variable number of bones, five, three, two and
one occurring in different genera. Of these, one is shown by its relation to the quadrate
and maxilla to be the quadrato-jugal ; the squamosal, the only other bone in Amphibia
being either an enlargement of one of the other bones or the product of their fusion.

EVOLUTION AND ORIGIN OF AMPHIBIA. 197

Certain of the Embolomeri (Hogyrinus) show an interesting intermediate condition
in the fact that the upper edge of the squamosal in them merely articulates with and is
attached by ligaments to the lower surface of the supra-temporal, whereas in Osteolepids

these two bones are completely separated by the spiracular notch, and in later Amphibia
they are rigidly connected by a digitated suture.
