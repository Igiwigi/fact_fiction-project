Processes of magnetic reconnection in solar flares
and of particle acceleration at shocks, driven by fast CMEs, are believed to be the origin of
SEP events [4]. However, the relative role of flares and CME-driven shocks in the processes
of particle energization is still under debate. This is mainly due to the fact that SEP events
appear in connection with both solar flares and CMEs, while the transport conditions of SEPs
in interplanetary (IP) space blur direct cause/effect association [5,6]. Critical information on
the acceleration mechanisms of SEPs can be derived from the remote sensing observations of
the solar corona during solar eruptive phenomena (e.g. solar flares, CMEs) [7,8]. At the Sun,
both X-ray and y-ray emissions are produced by accelerated particles during solar flares.
