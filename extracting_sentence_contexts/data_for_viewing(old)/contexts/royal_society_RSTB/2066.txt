is rather surprising that our plant appears to have been quite as highly differentiated
with respect to its leaves, as any of the Permian Medullosez, while its stem-structure
was so much simpler. This suggested at the outset a doubt whether the single speci-
men which had then been examined might not represent the first-formed, basal
portion of a stem which had not yet attained its full complexity. This idea, however,
appears to me no longer tenable. All the four specimens show just about the same
degree of complexity, all alike having three (or locally four) similar steles. And
further, it is significant that no appreciable difference in structure is apparent between
_ the upper and lower ends of the individual specimens. In Specimen II. the part
actually sectioned was about nine inches long, and in Specimen I. nearly the same.
Tt must therefore, I think, be taken as proved that the structure of the stem in our
species was really far simpler than in any other known Medullosa, as regards the
small number of the steles, and the absence of differentiation among them. This fact
agrees well with its greater antiquity. Possibly some botanists might regard this
difference as sufficient to justify generic separation. I do not think so myself, bearing
in mind the close agreement with other species of Medudlosa in leaf-characters, and in
the structure of the individual steles. In both points the agreement appears to be
closest with M. Leuckarti.

This leads us to consider the possible relation of Medullosa anglica to the Colpo-
aylon aeduense of BroneNntart, which is known to have much in common with
M. Leuckarti, while showing a far simpler anatomical structure. Colpoxylon, to judge
from the admirable figures and description in M. Renauut's splendid contribution to
the ‘ Fossil Flora of Autun,’* was monostelic in parts of the stem, the large single
vascular cylinder having a very irregular outline. In other parts there are two such
