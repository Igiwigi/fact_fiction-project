The paired terminal supero-marginalia differ widely in appearance according to the
locality in which they are found. Specimens from Kagetrup (Denmark) closely
resemble the corresponding plates of M. tuwmidus.

Other specimens from the same locality and also from Stevns Klint (Denmark)
have the tumidity at the distal extremity of the plate (Plate 15, fig. 11). The terminal
supero-marginalia from Annetorp (Sweden) and Rejstrup (Denmark) differ again, as
they are high and narrow with a prominent abactinal tumidity (Plate 10, fig. 9).

It is probable that the great majority of the individuals had extended arms due to
the breaking down of the large terminal supero-marginalia as has already been
described in the case of the radiate variety of M. twmidus. In fact no large terminal
supero-marginalia are found in the higher beds of the Danian (see p. 148).

THE METOPASTER UNCATUS SERIES,

We have seen that the study of the evolution of the M. Parkinsoni series shows
lines of development which lead toâ€”

(1) The loss of spine pits.

(2) An increase in height of the marginalia.

(3) Various changes in the shape of the surface of the supero-marginalia.
