The following comparisons were made of those received on September 13th by
means of water of different temperatures in the following manner. Water of a higher
temperature than needed was placed in a vessel, and the required temperature was
obtained by the application of cold water, the two being well mixed together till the
standard thermometer read the same at every part of the mixture. The thermo-
meters were then all placed in it and parallel to each other ; they were thus allowed to
remain for one hour, and their readings were taken quickly. Water of a different
temperature was then prepared in a similar way, and $80 on successively. The com-
parisons occupied an entire night, and during this interval of time the temperature
of the room was kept uniform, in fact it did not vary one degree. [

This method was found to be very troublesome, and to ensure accuracy a
long time was required to be devoted to it. The mixing of water of different
temperatures together, so that the whole mixture became of the same temperature,
from the circumstance of its being 80 bad a conductor of heat, was found to be
difficult. After this time I adopted the following method in all subsequent compa-
risOns :â€”

1st. The water was heated to a temperature above the highest required.

2nd. The standard and all the thermometers for comparison were placed, in this
water, parallel to each other, and after some time their readings were taken as
