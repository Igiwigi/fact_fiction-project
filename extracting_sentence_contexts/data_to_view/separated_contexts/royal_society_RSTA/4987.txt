Art. 51. The foregoing investigation has established the fact that the co-axial
minors, of a general determinant of Order m, are connected by 2" — n? +n — 2
relations, or in other words, that but n? — n + 1 of them ean assume given values. Of these relations a certain number are connected in a special manner with the
determinant of Order n, in that they are not relations merely between the coaxial
minors of one of the principal coaxial minors of the determinant.
