In ยง3, we introduce a general definition of disagreement and discuss many instances of local
agreement and global disagreement. Section 4 reviews the sheaf-theoretic definition of non-
locality and contextuality, and presents the connection with disagreement. In ยง5, we show that,
in many relevant valuation algebras, detecting disagreement is in fact an inference problem,
and introduce the concept of complete disagreement. Section 6 deals with the connection
between disagreement and logical forms of contextuality. Finally, we discuss future research paths
in ยง7.
