Remark 1.4. Larson & Rolen [10] established the precise integrality properties of the values
P(g). The proofs of theorems 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3 depend critically on the fact that the generating function
in (1.1), where q:= 27" | satisfies q-1/4P(q) =1/n(t). It is now well understood that the circle
method can be applied to modular forms whose poles are supported at cusps. Moreover, for
those modular forms that have non-positive weight, the method typically offers exact formulae
as in theorem 1.2.
