Definition 2.5. A well-posed open-loop system (A,B) is called feedback stabilizable if there
exists an operator C € £(D(A), U) such that the triple (A,B,C) is regular with Iy: U— U as an
admissible feedback, and the following operator

AT :=A+BCy, D(A") ={x€D(Ca):(A + BCa)x € X}
generates an exponentially stable semigroup T“ on X. As a matter of fact, feedback stabilization is not an easy task and until now we do not have
a simple characterization of stabilization. However, Weiss & Rebarber [42] proved that if a well-
posed open loop (A,B) is feedback stabilizable, there exists a >0 such that for any 4 €C with
Red > —a,

Im(A — A_1) + Im(B) 5 X. In the case of bounded control operator B (this is the case when the control is not acting at
the boundary), there is a nice (old) characterization of the feedback stabilization due to Bhat &
Wonham [43].
