A quarter of a century ago, or more, the
hole skeleton, in Birds especially, occupied much of my thought ; and from an even
‘parlier period I have never ceased to gather together embryos and young Birds of all
‘kinds, which should some day serve for a renewal of the work.

5 Jn this short paper, dealing with a single region, and that principally in a single

‘gype, I give the first-fruits of a revised study of the Bird’s skeleton. Many recent

orkers have dealt with the development of one part or other of the Bird’s wing ; but

a seemed to me that we had from none of them a minute account of the successive
Shanges in any one form. And now, having made such a study, I think I have not
failed to draw some new facts from it.

[ have carefully worked out the structure of the carpus in the Chick of seven days
gand older. I find that the two persistent carpals of the Bird’s wing, the radiale and
gulnure of authors, show evidence of being compound structures, probably containing
Swithin themselves remnants of an intermediwm and a centrale. The distal row of

carpal elements was particularly in want of further study.
