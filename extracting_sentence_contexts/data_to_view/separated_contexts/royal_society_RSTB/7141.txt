These
excised-pieces are probably elongated, but their extent cannot be ascertained because of
confusion with residual embryo tissue. One of these specimens was a control, while in the
other two the original polarity of the reversed-piece has been converted to that of the
residual blastoderm. The excised-piece in these experiments therefore frequently develops only neural tissue
and mesenchyme, in spite of the fact that it contains node tissue. This may often be a non-
specific effect of its isolation from the residual blastoderm. Even when well healed however
into the head region of the latter, the node tissue still does not develop according to its
presumptive fate, but forms head-like structures instead; which suggests a direct influence
of the residual blastoderm.
