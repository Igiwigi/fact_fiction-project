Variation within the species, due partly to differences in environ-
mental factors, is often considerable. It is thus difficult to formulate descriptions that will
permit the ready identification of specimens at all stages of development. In fact no one
character is sufficient to separate species, and a number of such characters as presence or
absence of warts on the peridium, colour, texture, venation of gleba,{ shape of asci,
number of spores in the ascus and size, shape and sculpturing of the spores must be con-
sidered. For this reason the key given below is supplemented by a table of characters
(table 2). It is certain that the confusion which still exists in the classification of this
genus is partly a result of different specific names having been given to the same species
according to its age or to its response to environmental variations.
