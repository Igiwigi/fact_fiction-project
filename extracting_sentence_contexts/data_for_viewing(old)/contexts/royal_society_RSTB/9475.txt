how order and sequencing of information influences what actu-
ally is most remembered [6], as do anchoring effects [7]. Other
examples would be how judicial case decisions on length of sen-
tencing are affected by whether crime photos are in black and
white or in colour [8], and how attractiveness of suspects also
influences judicial decisions [9,10].

Such examples well illustrate that an understanding of
cognitive neuroscience can be both relevant and important to
any effort to optimize the use of forensic science from the initial
to the final stages of the judicial process. The forensic evidence
that is put before the factfinder is going to be used by humans
making legal and factual decisions, and therefore it is critical
to understand what factors affect those decisions. It is not suf-
ficient to create an ideal forensic science in an isolated vacuum.
For forensic science to work, it must take into account the
human element, and therefore consider the cognitive neuro-
science that will help use that human element as optimally as
possible. Although the above-mentioned issues are mainly
not under the forensic expertâ€™s control, they, nevertheless,
are relevant to the forensic contribution to the courts, and
therefore, an issue for the forensic community to consider.
Section 2(b) deals with elements that are more under the con-
trol of the expert appearing in court.
