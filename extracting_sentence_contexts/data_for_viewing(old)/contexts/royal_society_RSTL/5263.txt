the channels containing the blood- globules were spaces excavated in the blastematous
mass; their homogeneous walls I believe to be produced secondarily, and their
coalescence to be effected by a simple extension of their cavity.

About the eleventh day I found the parenchyma of the liver consisting of nuclei, cells,
amorphous and abundant oily matter ; here and there in the midst of the substance
there were seen mall bright yellow particles, which were doubtless biliary matter ;
the gall-bladder also was full of green bile, the presence of which, as there was no
trace of cysto-hepatic ducts to be seen, I cannot satisfactorily explain ; it does not
appear to me, however, an idea to be altogether rejected, that before the hepatic
ducts are fully developed, and have begun to eliminate bile in the parenchyma, their
fanction should for a time be performed by the epithelium of the gall-bladder, which
lies in close contact almost imbedded in the mass of the liver: the fact, at any rate,
is, that the gall-bladder contains bile, when there is not a trace of it in the ducts, and
when their development is yet incomplete.

The development of the pancreas seems to be very similar in its mode to that of
the liver, and the same plan will, I believe, be found to be followed in the formation
of all glands. The organ consists at, first of blastematous matter, imbedding nuclei
and myriads of granular globules, which are clustered over with oily molecules. The
Sides of the mass are even, and it presents no trace of the ultimate glandular vesicles,
which are 80 characteristic of its adult condition. About the same time that the
ducts of the liver appear, those of the pancreas begin to be developed; they are not
formed by a protrusion from the intestine, but rather seem to develope themselves on
the spot where they are to exist. This at least is the case with the main trunks ; the
