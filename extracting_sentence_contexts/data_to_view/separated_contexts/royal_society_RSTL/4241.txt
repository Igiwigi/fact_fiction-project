And if such observations be made for a number of very
distant places, the common *© establishment” does not represent a corresponding fact
at different places. In some places it means the time of high water one day after
the highest tide; in some, the time two days after the hbighest tide; in some, three
days ; for the © age of the tide” is different at different places, and the tide which
corresponds to the new or full moon comes after the new or full moon by one, two,
or three days. Hence, in order that we might compare the tides of distant places
by means of a fact which had the same meaning in all of them, I proposed, in my
former Essay, instead of taking this common Establishment, to take what I then
called the corrected Establishment, namely the mean of all the lunitidal intervals, that
is, of the intervals by which the tide follows the moon's transit. And this corrected
establisghment I nsed in the discussion of the extensive series of obseryations made in
1836. In general, the corrected establishment is about thirty minutes less than the
common establishment.
