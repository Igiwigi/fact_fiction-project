sition in the mass, enables them to act jointly on the magnet or the electric current,
and affect or be affected by them ; and that if the particles are not s0 arranged, but
are in all directions in the mass, then the sum of their forces externally is nothing,
and no inductive exertion of the magnet or current can develope the slightest trace of
the phenomena.

2578. And that particles even before crystallization can act in some degree at a
distance, by virtue of their crystallizing force, is, I think, shown by the following

fact. A jar containing about a quart of solution of sulphate of soda, of such strength
as to erystallize when cold by the touch ofa crystal of the salt or an extraneous body,
was left, accidentally, for a week or more unattended to and undisturbed. The solution
remained fluid ;. but on the jar being touched, crystallization took place throughout
the whole mass at once, producing clear, distinct, transparent plates, which were an
inch or more in length, up to half an inch in breadth ; and very thin, perbaps about
the one-fiftieth or one-sixtieth of an inch. These were all horizontal, and of course
parallel to each other; and I think, if I remember rightly, had their length in the same
direction; and they were alike in character, and, apparently, in quantity in every
part of the jar. They almost held the fluid in its place when the jar was tilted ; and
when the liquid was poured off presented a beautiful and uniform assemblage of
erystals. The result persuaded me, at the time, that, though the influence of a par-
ticle in solution and about to crystallize, must be immediately and essentially upon
