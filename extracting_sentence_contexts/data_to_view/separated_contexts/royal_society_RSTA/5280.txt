However, the rapidly expanding global population
and its tendency to concentrate in mega-cities are putting
untold pressure on sewage processing and all aspects
of current water treatment systems, which after all

were designed for the needs of the past centuries. Some of the most pressing demands in terms
of modern requirements include the need to:

— reduce the energy/carbon footprint of established water treatment methods or replace
them with more efficient alternatives;

— treat high-concentration and toxic industrial effluents, which until recent legislation were
disposed to landfill;

— treat low-concentration/trace high-impact contaminants, such as hormones derived from
excreted contraceptive hormones and other endocrine disruptors;

— recover high-value resources, such as precious metals (e.g. platinum) derived from street
wash-off originating from catalytic converters of vehicles;

— transform the high-organic-component wastewaters to renewable energy in the form of
microbial methane generation or bioplastics; and —

— reduce current dependence on centralized national water supply grids and introduce the iS
ability for more localized self-sufficiency. 13

A few striking facts highlight some of these challenges and the urgent need for new aoe
technologies to maintain water quality in the face of modern-day needs. Perhaps the most :
alarming are plummeting sperm counts, which some research suggests have halved in the past 78
50 years. This is attributed, in part at least, to the ineffectiveness of current sewage treatment [8
processes to remove the remnants of contraceptive pills excreted in urine [1,2].
