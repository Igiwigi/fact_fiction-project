model Y as a Bernoulli random variable with covariates. As this
is a multivariate model, the dataset has a unique row for each com-
bination of i and f, and all species show either a 1 or 0 value for the
same record. Thus, one record contains all the presence/absence
information for each species and all covariate data. For the bivari-
ate species model (i.e. associations between any two species),
we extracted the information for the two focal species plus all
covariate data.

There is a well-documented issue of detectability with camera
trap studies (e.g. [18,20]), wherein it is important to acknowledge
that an observed value Y,i;=0 may mean either that a species
was not present, or that the species was in fact present but could
not be detected. We call Z,i: the latent (unmeasured) variable for
the true presence versus absence of species s at location i and
time t. We assume that detection (Y,i:=1) or non-detection
(Ycit = 0) depends on the latent presence (Z,j=1) or absence
(Z.it = 0) and detection probability p.j. The observed presence/
absence of each species is modelled as
YoilZsi, Pav = Bernoulli(Zi Â«Psi
Only when Z,=1 does the model allow for the possibility that
Yit = 1, and further, this detection occurs with probability p.i;. There-
fore, psit is the probability of detecting species s at location i and time t.
Moreover, the model assumes independence of Yi conditional on
Zi and psi. We model the logit of this detection probability as
