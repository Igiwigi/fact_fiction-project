The colour bar relates the colour with the oscillations amplitude. Panels (a—d) show the basins for
[4 = 0.02, 0.03, 0.04 and 0.05, respectively. (Online version in colour.)

we can see that for 4 = 0.04 the yellow basins is completely gone. In fact, figure 5 shows us, as
we increase the values of jz, the erosion of the higher amplitude basin. But, it also shows that
the effect of introducing a forcing is to create a yellow ‘island’ around 2 =1. This means that
near a specific frequency the forcing is able to counter the damping effects and to recover the
high-amplitude interwell oscillations.
