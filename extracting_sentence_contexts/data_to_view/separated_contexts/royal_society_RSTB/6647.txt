The rise of birch pollen in this part of the diagram may well be a local effect pro-
duced by birchwoods growing on the raised-bog surface, as in the site next discussed. Trundle Mere B (fig. 17). This site is certainly that of the four most removed from the influence of the fen
margin, and of the fen margin woods, and, as we have already indicated, it is this fact
which appears to be responsible for the high pollen values of hazel and mixed-oak
forest trees. There is at the base of the diagram some indication of the formation of brushwood
peat, and this corresponds with high values for alder pollen and low values for oak and
hazel. From 120 to 60cm. again, there is a layer of brushwood in the peat corre-
sponding with a maximum of birch pollen, and this certainly appears to be a purely
local effect.
