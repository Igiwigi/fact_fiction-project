It is easily ascertained that the finer bands belong to the
extraordinary, the broader to the ordinary ray. (10.) A plate of quartz, cut perpendicular to the axis, with oil of sassafras, gives
very distinct bands, which may be seen to be in fact composed of two sets s8uperim-
posed and nearly coinciding, since when the plate is inclined (as in position 1, see
fig. 2) at intervals throughout the spectrum the near coincidence of the dark spaces
of one set, with the bright of the other, occasions an extreme faintness in the bands. In this case the two pencils deviate sufliciently from the axis to approximate to plane
polarized light, and thns the Nicol-prism causes the indistinctness to disappear at
each quarter of a revolution by stopping one of them alternately. (11.)
