Figure 5. Electroluminescence decays obtained with different pulse widths (top to bottom: 100, 8, 5, 4 xs) for the device
described in [26] as A1. Dashed lines are eye guides to point out the monoexponential character of the decays.

of delayed electroluminescence. In devices with a relatively low contribution of TTA to the
total electroluminescence, it is reasonable to assume that the annihilation is never a dominant
mechanism of triplet decay and, therefore, the change in triplet lifetime must be due to a current
density-related increase in concentrations of charge carriers, which are effective quenchers of
triplet states. In fact, hole transport material- and electron transport material-derived charge
carriers were directly shown to quench TTA-inducing triplets in several different OLED devices
[25,26]. On the other hand, in the devices where the TTA contribution is high, the consumption of


triplets may be second order in triplet concentration and the (pseudo)first-order time constant—
triplet lifetime—is naturally changing with current density.

Another general observation suggesting the TTA mechanism is the distinct shape of the
dependence of initial intensity of delayed emission on current density. As expected, the intensity
scales approximately quadratically with current density below a certain point, and approximately
linearly above it. The low current density regime is easily explained by the expected first-order
decay (radiative and non-radiative) of excited states, which results in the triplet concentration
