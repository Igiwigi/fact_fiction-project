to 2* g4/, the obliquity of the ecliptic in the moon only to
1* 29/; the inclination of the orbit of the moon, on the con-
trary, to 5? 15', and its synodic period, during which it per-
forms a revolution round its axis is = 29% 12; it follows, that
its brightest twilight, to where it loses itself in the light reflected
by the almost fully. illuminated disk of our earth, must, at
least at its nodes, last 5* g', and that it will be still longer at
other parts: of the orbit, according to the situation of the
nodes. :

sars, as they approach the moon, diminish in splendour at the
most only a very few seconds before their occultations, it was
