data the crushing load for granite or porphyry being about 2000 tons per square foot,
and the weight of the material 178 lbs. per cube foot, the modulus of cohesion, or
the length of the column in feet of the material that shall crush by its own weight, is

2000x2220 =25169 feet=4-195 miles of 6000 feet. But the height of the column of the

Z In fact while the materials of the hardest and most coherent rock are crushed at 14
