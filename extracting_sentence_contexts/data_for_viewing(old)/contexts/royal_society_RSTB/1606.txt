sume yaloa as an ordinury “coniplex” in most other Siluride, although the possibility
that the centrum of the Grst vertebra may also be included in it cannot altogether
be left ont of sight. We are of opinion that Rersswar’s ‘first vertebra will ulti-

nately be found to possess the same significance ax in Lorivaria and its allies, but a
cuvefidl re-exumination of this curious Siluroid is necessary before perfectly trustworthy
conclusions can be arrived af. The cavum sinus imparis, the atrial cavities, and the
sings ondolymphaticus are apparently normal so far as their mutual relations are
concerned, and lie on the wpper surfaces of the basioceipital and the anterior portion
of the “ first” vertebra. The relations of the scaphia to the literal walls of the two
wivin would also seer to be noimul. The dorsal wall of the caytum sinus imparis,
lowever, must be fibrous, or at all events the cavum is nol roofed in by horizontal
plates from the exoceipitals; and in the fact that the sacculi ovcupy mere depressions

Bilovidi, and resembles the Loricaroid types, The relative positions of the sacouli,

negative the possibility of any forward dislocation of the anterior vertebra into the
cranial eavity having taken place, Claustra and intercalaria are probably absent,
or at all events are neither figured nor mentioned by Rersswen. The seaphium, as
in some other 8, abnormales and in the Loricaroid genera, has neither condylar nor
ascériding processes, and, as is the ease with the great majority of the abnormal types,
the tripus has a straight or but very slightly curved “crescentic” process.
