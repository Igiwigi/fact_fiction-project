Failure, then, can result from an 7. | m pl ic atio ns
automated sensorimotor mapping doing what it is supposed to
do—but the context happens to be one where the sensorimotor
mapping led to a bad outcome. Failure may also result from an inability to overcome the
automated sensorimotor mapping. That is, the two necessarily
compete, and the automated one sometimes wins. (If it could
not ever win, then it would not serve its purpose of reducing cog-
nitive load.) And the ego dystonia associated with self-control
failure comes from the fact that the brain contains specialized
systems that can recognize and signal failures. The self-control
failure is not selected for in the conventional sense, but it selected
for indirectly, in the sense that it is the unavoidable price worth
paying in exchange for the benefits of automatization. Self-

By this perspective, self-control is ‘just’ a type of economic
choice (as argued by Berkman et al. [12]).
