4, Beyond the quantityâ€”quality trade-off

In the sections above, we have made the argument that, with
the exception of avoiding substantial costs of tight birth spa-
cing on infant survival, the costs of high fertility on
offspring quality appear largely offset by the benefits of
greater offspring quantity, at least in the observed range of
our species [62]. In this section, we propose that, in addition
to stochastic variation [99,100], fertility variation prior to the
demographic transition can be better understood in terms of
the individual optimization of alternative life-history trade-
offs inherent to iteroparous and sexually reproducing species.
Note that in no sense are we refuting the fact that reproductive
success is a function of offspring quantity multiplied by off-
spring quality. Fitness is necessarily measured as the


reproductive value of offspring; Fisher [101] recognized that fully matured, since reproducing prior to completed adoles- | 6 |
