This large family, although so profusely represented in the Triassic
fauna, is of distinct post-Paleeozoic character. Indeed, its preponderance in individuals,
together with the striking radiate character, have done much to encourage the idea
of a paleontological break between the Palzozoic and Triassic-Recent coral faunas. Yet the curious fact is that everyone admits, in a general way, the descent of this
family from the Paleozoic Cyathophylloids. The latter may be said then to have
most completely undergone a change in form during the interval that elapsed between
Carboniferous and Triassic time. At the same time, true Cyathophyllids are present
in the St.
