hyomandib. mandibulam
internum, s. lig. sustentaculi. This is phylogenetically very early developed; it i
in fact, found in all the cartilaginous Fishes above the Notidanide. This ligamen
moreover, frequently contains fibrous and even hyaline cartilage, e.g., in G
Trygon, Torpedo. ; There exists not unfrequently a ligamentous connexion between the labyrinthie
region of the cranium and the proximal end of the hyoid element, e.g., in Oxyrhina,
Centrophorus, Sphyrna, Trygon, Raja; and these ligaments are certainly not the
remnants of cranio-hyoidean muscles, although they sometimes (Oxyrhina) do serve
as additional supporters of muscular fibres.
