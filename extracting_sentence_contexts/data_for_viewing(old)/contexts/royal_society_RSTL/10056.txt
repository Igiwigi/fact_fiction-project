but that they are formed by lymphoid cells ; an4 she faund that there are more
concentric corpuscles during involution than at other times.

WarnxEy (69), 1878, in a short note, showed that the follicles consist of two parts,
which differ in the character of their network, and of the cells contained in their
meshes, and in the arrangement of the blood vessels. He described granular cells,
which help to form, partly by a process of vacuolation, the concentric corpuscles. These
granular cells are attached to the blood vessels, and to the trabeculze. He found giant
cells in the medulla, and stated that the concentric corpuscles are concerned in the
formation of vessels and trabecule ; and that in fresh preparations colourless cells are
seen, which contain granules aud spherules of haemoglobin.

Kris (70), 1879, confirmed the fact of the existence of a cortical and medullary
portion in the follicle. He said that in the medulla there are large endothelial cells,
each of which fills up a mesh of reticulum ; and there are transition forms between
these and the granular cells, and between these last and giant cells.

KL (71), 1881, found that the thymus does not much vary in the young and in
the adult Guinea Pig.

WanNEy (72), 1881, in a second short note, stated that there is an increase of con-
nective tissue during involution, inside and outside the follicle ; that the cortical part
of the follicle attains its greatest size at the period of the greatest activity of the gland ;
and that the granular cells are actively concerned in the formation of connective tissue.
A network of connective tissue corpuscles and a reticulum were described as both
