Conclusion

The scenarios presented in this paper are in some ways unexpected. As such, they may also be
perceived with scepticism and concern. The very fact that machines may benefit from humans
could scare many people. Yet, as we provide machines with self-learning capabilities and with
goals of continuous improvement, it is only natural that machines will benefit from their
interaction with us and from their existence in an ecosystem where we are both ‘living’. As shown in figure 1, machines feed on

— Sensors, embedded sensors, wireless sensors, sensors networks

— Actuators, MEMS, smart materials, optogenetics

— Communications support, mesh networks, self-creating networks, 5G, 6G and beyond

— AI, GAN, Deep Learning, DT, Cognitive DT

— Cooperative support, swarms, emerging intelligence

— Augmented humans, BCI, seamless connectivity, prosthetics

— Autonomous decision capabilities, decision making, emergent meaning, complex
systems

— Self-replication capabilities, smart materials, cloning, instantiation

— Self-evolving capabilities, sentiment analyses, awareness recognition, intention recognition


With the two last items, self-replication and self-evolving capabilities seem to originate from
science fiction.
