(f) Growth and Regression of the Corpus Luteum.â€”Corpora lutea were found in
the ovaries of only 18 squirrels ; all these were killed during pregnancy, or after parturi-
tion, in the months of March, June, July, August and September. No post-partum
ovulation had occurred in any of the 22 lactating squirrels examined, and in only 7 of
these were the remains of the corpora lutea of pregnancy still to be seen. Almost all the
corpora lutea were measured in section (Appendix 6), but owing to the fact that many
were irregular in shape the mean diameters obtained by the method described can only
give approximate indications of the size of the body. Taken in conjunction with direct
comparison of lutein cell size, however, these measurements showed that the corpus
luteum reaches its maximum size rapidly, and then has a mean diameter 1-0-1-3 mm. The corpus luteum begins to regress about half-way through pregnancy; in No. 93,
where an embryo weighed 1-07 gm., signs of shrinkage and degeneration were already
apparent and in No. 107 having embryos weighing 1-87 gm.
