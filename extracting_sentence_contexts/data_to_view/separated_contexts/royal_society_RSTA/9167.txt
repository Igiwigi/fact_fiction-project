Cleavage.—The cleavage common to the series, parallel to 7’{201}, is developed, but
is not very facile. There is quite a good cleavage parallel to b {010}, and in this salt this ,
cleavage is undoubtedly the better one of the two. The fact was confirmed on several
erystals of different crops, and excellent images of the signal were obtained from the
cleaved surfaces, at exactly 90 degrees from ¢ faces subsisting on the fragments
