to the aQtion of the ſun's rays, cauſe a certain quantity of”
pure air to be produced, is a fa& which has been put beyond?
all doubt ; but it does not appear to me to be by any means fo.
clearly proved, that this air is © elaborated in the plant by the”
<« powers of vegetation ;”—* phlogiſticated or fixed air being
< firſt abſorbed or imbibed by the plant as food, and the dephlo-"
« oiſticated air being rejected as an excrement :” for, beſides
that many other ſubſtances, and in which no elaboration, ot
circulation, can poſlibly be ſuſpefed to take place, cauſe the *
water in which they are expoſed to the aftion of light to yield
dephlogiſticated air as well as plants, and even in much greater
quantities, and of a more eminent quality, the circumſtances
of the leaves of a vegetable, which, accuſtomed to grow in air,
are ſeparated from its ſtem, and confined in water, are fo un-
natural, that I cannot conceive, that they can perform the®
fame funRions in ſuch different ſituations. :
Among many facts which have been brought in ſupport of ©
the received opinion of the elaboration of the air in the veſſels
of the plants in the experiments in queſtion, there is one upon;
which great ſtreſs has been laid, which, I think, requires fur=
ther examination. | The freſh healthy leaves of vegetables, ſeparated from the”
plant, and expoſed in water to the ation of the ſun's rays,

on the Preduttion of Dephlogiſticated Air, 119
appear, by all the experiments which have hitherto been made,
'to furniſh air only for @ ſhort time; after a day or two, the
leaves changing colour, ceaſe to yield air : and this has been

conceived to ariſe from the powers of vegetation being de-
ſtroyed ; or, in other words, the death of the plant ; and from
hence it has been inferred, with ſome degree of plauſibility,
not only that the leaves aftually retained their vegetative powers
Fr ſome time after they were ſeparated from their ſtock, but
That it was in conſequence of the exertion of theſe powers,
Bat the air, yielded inthe experiment, was produced.
