Development. —In the account of the first stages of development of Lepidosteus,
mode of formation of the optic cup, the lens, &c., have been described (vide Plates 22 }
23, figs. 23, 26, 35). With reference to the later stages in the development of the eye, |
the ouly subject with which we propose to deal is the growth of the mesoblastie |
processes which enter the cavity of the vitreous humour through the choroid slit.

Lepidosteus is very remarkable ſor the great number of mesoblas cells which thus
enter the cavity of the vitreous humour, and for the fact that these cells are at first
unaccompanied by any vascular structures (Plate 24, fig. 43, v.h.). The mesoblast
cells are scattered through the vitreous humour, and there can be no doubt that
during early larval life, at a period however when the larya is certainly able to 8e,
every histologist would consider the vitreons humour to be a tissue formed of scattered
cells, with a large amount of intercellular substance ; and the fact that it is 80 appears
to us to demonstrate that KessLER's view of the vitreous humour being a mers
transudation is nob tenable.

Tn the larva five or six days after hatching, and about 15 millims, in length, the
choroid slit is open for its whole length. The edges of the slit near the lens are
folded, 80 as to form a ridge projecting into the cavity of the vitreous humour, while
nearer the insertion of the optic nerve they cease to exhibit any s8uch stracture. The
mesoblast, though it projects between the lips of the ridge near the lens, only extends
through the choroid slit into the cavity of the vitreous humour in the neighbourhood
of the optic nerve, Here it forms a lamina with a thickened edge, from which scattered
cells in the cavity of the vitreous humour seem to radiate.
