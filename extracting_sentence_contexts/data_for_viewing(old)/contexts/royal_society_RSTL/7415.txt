E Surely there must be some honiologies between these organs existing in the Echino-

Tmata and Nematoidea respectively. And if not, where else are we to look amongst

e lower invertebrata for the representatives of these integumental pores which have
been shown to be 80 numerous in the free and in some of the parasitic Nematoids !

All the Nematoids and almost all the Echinoderms are dicecious; and though in the
majority of the latter the orifices of the genital organs are multiple, still in the Zolo-
thuriade there is only a single exit in the dorsal region of the body. As pointed out by
Mbres, the Echinoderms never exhibit a perfect radial symmetry, and in some whole
families even, such as the Spatangoids and Clypeastroids, there is an approximation
to a bilateral symmetry ; whilst the fact is as certain as it is remarkable, that * in the
laryal state * * radial symmetry is totally absent, the young Echinoderm exhibiting as
complete a bilateral symmetry as annelids or insects‚Äù . The peculiar method by which
