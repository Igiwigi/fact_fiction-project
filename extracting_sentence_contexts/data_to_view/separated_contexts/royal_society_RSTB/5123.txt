The closing of the fontanelle by cartilage in Amia,
Lepidosteus, and certain Teleosts, must be a secondary condition, and seems to be
correlated with the form and position of the epiphysial organ. On the evidence derived from a study of the development of the cartilaginous roof in
a number of fishes, I conclude that the roof of the bony fish chondrocranium with its
extensive fontanelles, has been derived by the reduction of a more massive cartilaginous
roof, which probably possessed two small fontanelles, the more anterior of which was
related to the epiphysis. *

The fact that no process of fenestration occurs during the ontogeny of the lower
Neopterygian fishes, or of the more primitive Teleosts, may be readily understood if
the development of the bony cranial roof is considered. It is conceivable that, between
the hypothetical ancestor with the simple, box-like cranium, and the bony fishes, an
intermediate stage intervened in which a complete cartilaginous roof was present in
addition to a more superficial bony one.+ The closer approximation of the roofing
bones to the cartilaginous tectum, and their earlier appearance in the ontogeny, would
tend to preserve the fontanelles normally present only during the early stages of develop-
ment, and to obviate the necessity for or actually prevent the further growth of cartil-
age. Further, by the development of dermal bones in connection with the cranial roof,
and their adequate support by the lateral orbitosphenoids, ete., the primary cartilaginous
roof would be replaced functionally by the bony one and rendered superfluous.
