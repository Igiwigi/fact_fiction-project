obtained are illustrated in a striking way in the curves in figs. 8 and 9.

In order to bring out the influence of velocity we have treated the curve as being of
the form H/é = a+hf(V) where a and b are constant. This assumes then that
H =a0+b.0./(V): our purpose being to determine the nature of the function V.

One very striking fact is that in the first term a of this expression the curve gives
the same value of a as the slope of the total heat-loss curve, fig. 7, in our experiments
