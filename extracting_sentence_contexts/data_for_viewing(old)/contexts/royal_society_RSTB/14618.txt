Consider for instance the case of ownership of property:
the abstract knowledge that an object is mine or someone
else’s. Since ownership is invisible, it is often considered a
prototypical abstract conceptual domain that apparently
resists an embodied explanation [99]. However, knowledge
that an object belongs to oneself may be grounded in the
sense of possession, of how controllable by the self an
object is [100] and an early understanding may actually
develop even in prelinguistic infants as a by-product of

their intrinsic motivation to explore, manipulate and control
our immediate environment. It has in fact been proposed
that, because of such intrinsic motivation, during their first
2 years of life, infants are under pressure to identify the
objects in their environment that give rise to feelings of effi-
cacy and personal control, and to keep them apart from
those that instead thwart such feelings owing to the interfer-
ence from other people [101]. The former class of controllable
objects becomes the category of objects that are understood as
belonging to the self, while the latter class includes those that
are not. Casting this proposal with the resources provided by
our process model might reveal that such a curiosity-based
exploration relies on monitoring one’s competence improve-
ment (or lack thereof), which is indeed a fundamental
