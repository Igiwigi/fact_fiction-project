Two such sheaves have isomorphic restriction to
V x E, if and only if the respective Aj are the same. Proof. The first part is a standard fact. To deduce (2), we simply note that from the last part
of lemma 2.4, the pullback z*ยง is geometrically irreducible if G is geometrically irreducible. We
then obtain the stated formula from the classification of irreducible representations of a direct
product. a

We now present a first classification theorem that is well suited to cases where all sheaves
involved are self-dual.
