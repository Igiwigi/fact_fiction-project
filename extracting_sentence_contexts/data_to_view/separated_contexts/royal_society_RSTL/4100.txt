In order to hear the sound
distinctly, when not very powerful, it was sufficient to establisgh a communication be
tween the metallic bar and the ear by means of a wooden rod. In this manner the
sound was not unfrequently heard prolonged some seconds, though growing con-
stantly feebler, until it ceased entirely, after the source of magnerism had been with-
drawn from the electro-magnet. Mr. Farapay has remarked an analogous fact in
the action of the transparent medium on the polarized ray, an action which does not
cease immediately with the magnetism of the electro-magnet. Is this prolongation
owing to the magnetization of the electro-magnet not ceasing in a sudden manner ;
or to its return to its primitive molecular state not taking place instantaneously in the
