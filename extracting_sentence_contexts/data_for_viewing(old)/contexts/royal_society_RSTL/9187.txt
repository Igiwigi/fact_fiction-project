nerves in their function, we s0on see that in one important particular they differ widely
from such nerves; for we have seen that, after they have been divided, stimulation of
their peripheral parts still continues to be transmitted to their central parts, as shown
by the non-localizing movements of the polypite. Of course this transmission cannot
take place through the divided tissue-tracts themselves ; and hence the only hypothesis
we can frame to account for the fact of its occurrence is that which would suppose these
tissue-tracts, or afferent lines, to be capable of vicarious action. Such vicarious action
would probably be effected by means of intercommunicating lines, the directions of which
would probably be various. In this way we arrive at the hypothesis of the whole con-
tractile sheet being pervaded by an intimate plexus of functionally differentiated tissue,
the constituent elements of which are capable of vicarious action in a high degree (se
severity of section in fig. 8). And this hypothesis, besides being recommended by the
consideraticn of its being the only feasible one that is open, is confirmed by the fact that
the stimuli which it supposes to escape from a severed phalanx of radial lines, and thus

* Tt may here be stated that tho greater sensitiveness of tho nutrient tubes is alsv made apparent by the
responses of the nectocalyx ; for to a nip or prick of the general contractile shect the response by the nectocalyx
uxually consists, as before stated, in a local bending in of the part irritated ; whereas in response to similar
irritation of a radial tube, the response is usually a general bending in of the whole nectocalyxâ€”4. e. a general
spasm.

I may here obserye that cutting through all the nutrient tubes at; their insertion in the polypite has no effect
in preventing the localizing action of the latter as regards other parts of the bell.

+ We must not, however, conclude that these lines are radial structurally ; the evidence only proves that
