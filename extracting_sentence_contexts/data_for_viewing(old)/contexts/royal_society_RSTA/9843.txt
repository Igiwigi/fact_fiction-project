themselves felt in a very marked degree in carrying out this work. The specimens
are heated im vacuo, and this made it possible to employ very small specimens
without fear of oxidation; these small specimens, generally measuring about 6 mm.
cube, remained perfectly bright and were cooled with very great rapidity. The
temperatures of the specimens, up to the moment of quenching, was measured by
means of a thermo-couple placed in a small hole drilled to the centre of the specimen
of metal, and since in this apparatus the specimen is quenched by a powerful stream
of cold water which strikes the specimen in the furnace itself, and carries it out of
the furnace with the water, the quenching-temperatures were known as accurately as
those of the arrest-points on the cooling-curves.

The first series of quenching experiments were undertaken in order to prove that
the line GH really constitutes part of the solidus curve ; this fact is important not
only for fixing the position of the solidus curve itself, but also as supporting the
evidence for the existence of a definite compound at the concentration where the
step-up in the solidus is found. The result of one of these quenching experiments
has already been described and iilustrated in connection with alloy No. 75 (74'5 per
