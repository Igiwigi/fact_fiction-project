Informed (r= 0.15, p = 0.65) and deviants (r = 0.06, p = 0.86), as well


as for irregular standards (r = 0.21, p= 0.54) and deviants
(r= 0.15, p = 0.66). Thus, independent of lesion size, these
P3b results provide evidence for the significant impact of
cerebellar pathology on the use of temporal predictability
and the updating of a mental model of the environment as
reflected in the P3b. Moreover, the fact that deviance pro-
cessing was most affected in temporally regular, but not
irregular context substantiates initial assumptions that struc-
tural damage to the cerebellum leads to imprecise encoding
and use of temporal structure, and accordingly to the encod-
ing and use of temporal regularity. This, in turn, affects
optimized deviance processing in the case of maximal
temporal predictability as seen in the control group.

4. Discussion

Testing the proposed role of the cerebellum in precise event-
based temporal processing [4,14,39] and attempting to repli-
cate previous findings in healthy young participants [24] in
a healthy aging control cohort, this study investigated the
impact of cerebellar lesions on the interaction of formal struc-
ture (varying stimulus form) and temporal structure (varying
temporal regularity in tone sequences) in auditory deviance
processing.
