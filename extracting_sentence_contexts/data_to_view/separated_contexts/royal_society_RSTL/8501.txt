viz, this equation determines g as a function, in general a discontinuous function, of
(z. . . 2, w) such that the corresponding integral
is gdr...d:du
=: (a—a)?... +(e=2)*+ (e—w)2}4*7
may be the given function of the coordinates (@ . . . c, e). The equation is, in fact, the
distribution-theorem D. c

28, It is to be observed that the given function of (@ . . . c, e) must satisfy certain
conditions as to value at infinity and continuity, but it is not (as in the distribution-
theorems A, B, and C it is) required to satisfy a partial differential equation ; the
function, except as regards the conditions as to value at infinity and continuity, is abs0-
lutely arbitrary. The potential (assuming that the matter which gives rise to it lies wholly within a
finite closed surface) must vanish for points at an infinite distance, or more accurately
it must for indefinitely large values of a*. . . +*+@ be of the form, Constant + by
(@..; +$£+@, It may be a discontinnous function ; for instance outside a given
closed surface it may be one function, and inside the same surface a different function
of the coordinates (& . . . 6, e); viz. this may happen in consequence of an abrupt change
of the density of the attracting matter on the one and the other side of the given closed
surface, but not in any other manner; and, happening in this manner, then V', V” being
the values for points within and without the surface respectively, it has been seen to be

dV! dV" dV dV” dV! dV”
necessary that, at the surface, not only V/=V", but als0 ==... En 1 =

Subject to these conditions as to value at infinity and continuity, V may be any function
whatever of the coordinates (@ . . . c, e); and then taking W, the same function of
(Tz... 2, w), the foregoing equation determines eg, viz. determines it to be =( for those
parts of space which do not belong to the material space, and to have its proper value
as a function of (@ . . . 2, w) for the remaining or material space.
