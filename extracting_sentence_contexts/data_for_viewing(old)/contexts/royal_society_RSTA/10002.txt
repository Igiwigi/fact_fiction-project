We have also 8, = 2°8 x 107’, so that at @ = 1600 we get
(4:2 10")° x 10" = dart? (2:9 x 10™)* (2°8 x 10-7)? 1600 x 2°73 x 10%,

which gives ¢ = 2°6 x 10-* centim.

The thickness of the double layer on platinum polarised by depositing hydrogen on
it from dilute sulphuric acid has been calculated from the polarisation capacity by
several observers who have found t about 2x10-® centim. We should, of course,
expect the thickness to be about of the order of the diameter of a molecule, which is
believed to be about 2x10-* centim. I think the fact that the theory proposed here
leads to a value of ¢ in agreement with that which might have been expected on other
grounds shows that the theory is substantially correct.

Since platinum is an octovalent element we may take the number of free electrons
associated with each atom as 8, The charge p, carried by the free electrons in
one cubic centimetre of platinum ought therefore to be 8sNe/M, where s denotes the
density and M the atomic weight of the platinum. This gives

Po = —8x21°5 x 29x 10%+195 = —2°6 x 10",

which agrees very well with the value —2°7 x10" obtained from the negative leak.
The agreement between these two values of p, shows that all the 8 electrons associated
