(1) Observations are made on a nearly stationary meniscus which, as already pointed

out, (a) increases errors due to capillarity, and (b) makes errors of sub-division
in reading more serious, as they do not average out’as in a series taken on a
considerably rising temperature.

(2) Zero readings will be less accurate because (a) the depression and recovery are
both larger than at lower temperatures, and (6) the individual observation and
not a point on a mean curve is taken.

(3) Errors due to distillation are at a maximum.

In view of these facts, observations were carried on until the distribution of the
results assumed a fairly symmetrical form, similar in general appearance to a Gaussian
distribution of errors. This involved from about twenty to fifty observations on each
thermometer. The results are shown in Table XI, which shows “ errors” of the
various mercury thermometers at the steam point, when the Bureau International
figures for the fundamental intervals are employed. The “ probable error} is shown
at the foot of the table and the distribution of the observations is shown graphically
for a few of the thermometers in fig. 10. The curves have been obtained by giving a
weight of two to an observation at the actual observed figure and a weight of one at
+ 0-001° C, away. That is, the irregular curve represents the boundary of the area
filled by recording a system of four spots for each observation—two at the actual
observation and one on either side, thus :—
