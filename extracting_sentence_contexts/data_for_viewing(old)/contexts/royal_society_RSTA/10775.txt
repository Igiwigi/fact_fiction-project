quantity, and then trying to prove that it could not be negative in the case of
the are.

A single value of V corresponding to a single value of A is evidently not sufficient
to determine whether any conductor fulfils the above definition of resistance and
E.M.F. To determine this the current must be varied over some range, 5A, and in
such a manner that the conditions of the conductor remain unchanged, and a series
of observations must be made within this range.

The essential stipulation, that the test must not alter the body tested, is the main
difficulty in the experiments on the resistance and E.M.F.’s of the are. For it is well
known that, corresponding with each steady value of the current, the size and
configuration of the vapour column and craters are different in spite of the fact that
the length, the nature of the electrodes, and the other conditions may be kept
constant, so that the ares corresponding with any two different steady values of the
current, however nearly equal they may be, are really two distinct and different

potential difference V produced by a given steady change 6A in the current A, that
is to say, which depend on an excursion on the steady curve between V and A,
