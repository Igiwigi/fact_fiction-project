Dormancy

Hibernation, aestivation or diapause has never been recorded in any stage of the three
species of rat-flea (Xenopsylla). They are holodynamic, and reproduction can continue in
them indefinitely generation after generation. The fact that the larvae and the pupae of these rat-fleas died quickly at fatal low
temperatures (see p. 612) and fatal humidities (see p. 597) also suggests that hibernation and
aestivation cannot occur in them. In Nosopsyllus fasciatus, however, Bacot (1914, pp. 474,
539, 610) has stated that both of these occur in larvae within ‘hard cocoons’. In my view
the evidence is inconclusive, in the light of modern work.
