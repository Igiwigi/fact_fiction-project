It is probable that the presence of the lines of copper in the are spectrum of the
meteorites is due to the fact that copper wire was used to bind the meteorites to the
poles of the arc lamp. I have not yet had an opportunity of repeating the photo-
graphs with specimens of the meteorites which have not come in contact with copper
in this way, but observations of the spark and flame spectra of other portions of the
same meteorite have not confirmed the presence of copper.

4, Of the 43 lines in the tables for which no origins have been suggested, from the
Kensington maps of metallic are spectra, 29 are apparently coincident with lines
mapped by Kayser and Runge in the iron spectrum, but which do not appear in the
Kensington photographs. â€˜These are indicated in the tables by the letters K. and R.
(Kayser and Rune), in the column for remarks.

As I pointed out in my paper on the Iron Spectrum, these are very probably due to
