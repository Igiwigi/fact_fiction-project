Of the general accu- :
racy of those experiments, I have since had no reason to
doubt ; and their results, indeed, are coincident with those of
subsequent writers of the highest authority in chemistry. My
attention has been again drawn to the subject by the impor-
tant controversy which has lately been carried on between Mr.
Muxxar and Mr. Joan Davy, respecting the nature of mu-
riatic and oxymuriatic acids; and I have been induced, by
some hints which the discussion has suggested, not only to
repeat the principal experiments described in my memoir, but
to institute others, with the adyantage of a more perfect appa-
ratus than I then possessed, and of greater experience in the
management of these delicate processes. This repetition of my former labours has discovered to me
an instance, in which I have failed in drawing the proper con-
clusion from facts. In two comparative experiments on the
electrization of equal quantities of muriatic acid gas, the one

of which was dried by muriate of lime, and the other was in
its natural tate, I found a difference of not more than one per
cent.
