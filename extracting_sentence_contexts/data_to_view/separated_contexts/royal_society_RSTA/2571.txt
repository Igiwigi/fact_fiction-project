It is well-known that in
such a disposition of apparatus a vortex is created in the neighbourhood of the
rotating arm, so that the velocity of a point at any radius relative to the room does not
represent its velocity relative to the air. In addition to the difficulty mentioned
results obtained from air-velocities measured from motion in a circle cannot in some
classes of work be applied with safety to linear motion. In fact so serious have these
objections proved themselves to be that the method of obtaining velocity by means of
a rotating arm has been abandoned in meteorological work and in aeronautical
problems. (*) . :
