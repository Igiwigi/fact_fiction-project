But ifr = 3 or } (having an even denominator), we find further cases of splitting:

2qa|% (¢=3,4,5,3) and 2q|% (¢=83 or).
Two of these deserve special mention, because the isosceles triangles in their vertex figures

are obtuse-angled, indicating retrograde faces:

25|$ =—{5, $}+ 2{8, 5}, 1l=—3+2 +19;
23/4 = —{3, 33+ 2(5, 5}, 19 =—742.3420.

Here the total density dis obtained by adding the number of retrograde faces to the sum of
the component densities. In fact, the retrograde faces, being on the ‘far’ side of the centre,
are regarded as having passed beyond it.

If p = q, the bisector of the angle m/r decomposes the isosceles triangle (/ pr) into two
right-angled triangles (2 / 2r), so we get nothing fresh:

pp|r=2|p2r (A |

lal
If r = 2, we have pq\2 {i p'q|2- r{j (p>2>p’', q>2).
The faces at a vertex are {p}, {4}, {q}, {4}

with the squares crossing each other in the case of p’ ¢| 2 (because the {ps are then retro-
