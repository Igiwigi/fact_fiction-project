mental facts. 'The conclusion is, © that the magnetism. of two iron particles in the line
of magnetization is increased by their reciprocal action; but that, on the contrary, the
diamagnetism of two bismuth particles lying in this direction is diminished by their
reciprocal action.” The reciprocal action of the particles varies inversely as the cube
of the distance between them : at a distance expressed by the number 1, for example,
the enfeeblement is eight times what it would be at the distance 2.

The conclusion, as regards the iron, is undoubtedly correct; but I believe experi
ment proves that the mutual action of diamagnetic molecules, when caused to
approach each other, increases their repulsive action. I have had massive iron
moulds made and coated with copper by the voltaic current; into these fine bismuth
powder has been introduced and submitted to powerful hydraulic pressure. No sen-
Sible fact can, I think, be more certain, than that the particles of this dust are brought
into closer proximity along the line in which the pressure is exerted, and this is the
line of strongest diamagnetization. If a portion of the compressed mass be placed upon
the end of a torsion beam and the amount of repulsion measured, it will be found
that the repulsion is a maximum when the line of magnetization coincides with the
line of compression ; or, in other words, with that line in which the particles are
packed most closely together: if the bismuth were fixed, and the magnet moveable,
the former would repel the latter with a maximum force with the line of compression
parallel to the direction of magnetization: it is a stronger diamagnet in this direction
