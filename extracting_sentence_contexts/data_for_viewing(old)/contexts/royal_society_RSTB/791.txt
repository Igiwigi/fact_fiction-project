whatever other sets of fibres it may contain. The sense of smell has its cerebra
representation in these lobes.

In the Whale, the temporo-sphenoidal lobes are reduced to a minimal size, and the
commissure is correspondingly deficient.

The extreme retraction of the temporo-sphenoidal lobe produces an alteration i
the disposition of the parts of the brain, which must be thoroughly understood befor
an attempt is made to cut a series of sections through the hippocampus which will be
comparable with the series cut through this region in the brain of the Ox. Th
posterior limb of the fissure of Sylvius, instead of sloping upwards and backwards,
in other Mammals, passes almost directly upwards towards the apex of the conical brair
This is due to the fact that the temporo-sphenoidal lobe reaches so short a distance
forwards on the basal aspect of the brain that the frontal lobe is allowed to roll
round, as it were, into the place on the basal aspect usually occupied by
temporo-sphenoidal lobe. The posterior pillar of the fornix, and its continuation
the fimbria, are continued in a very open curve backwards and downwards without
any tendency to return. Tf, therefore, a section of the hippocampal region is to be
compared with a coronal section of the brain of a Sheep or Dog, it must be made in
plane extending backwards almost horizontally with regard to the plane of the u
callosutn.

The body of the fornix and its posterior pillar are adherent to the under surface 0
the corpus callosum. In the middle part of its course it can be detached, for its fibi
are here collected into a compact bundle placed at right angles to those of the corpus
