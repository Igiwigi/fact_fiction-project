Precisely the same law applies to explosions acting in close
vesscls: very minute apertures when they are only few in
number will permit explosions to pass, which are arrested by
much larger apertures when they fill a whole surface. A
small aperture was drilled at the bottom of a wire-gauze
lamp in the cylindrical ring which confines the wire-gauze ;
this, though less than #5 of an inch in diameter, passed the
flame and fired the external atmosphere, in consequence of
the whole force of the explosion of the thin stratum of the
mixture included within the cylinder driving the flame
through the aperture; though, had the whole ring been
composed of such apertures separated by wires, it would
have been perfectly safe. Nothing can demonstrate more decidedly than these simple
facts and observations, that the interruption of flame by solid
tissues permeable to light and air, depends upon no recondite
or mysterious cause, but to their cooling powers, simply con-
sidered as such. When a light included in a cage of wire-gauze is intro-
duced into an explosive atmosphere of fire-damp at rest, the
maximum of heat is s0on obtained, the radiating power of
the wire, and the cooling effect of the atmosphere, more effi-
cient from the mixture of inflammable air, prevents it from
ever arriving at a temperature equal to that of dull redness,

in which the radiating surface is considerably greater, and
the circulation of air less, preserves an equal temperature.
