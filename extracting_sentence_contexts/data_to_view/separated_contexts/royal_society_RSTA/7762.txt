The presence of the operator K and the fact that freedom must be reserved to impose
any type of loading condition suggests avoidance of any special types of functions in an
attempted solution. The functions to be employed are therefore considered to have
a general form, and to be capable of being expressed as double series in powers of r
and h, with time functions as coefficients. It will be observed that a solution will be
reached by a procedure somewhat the inverse of that pertaining to normal dynamical
