That the candle emits heat along with light, the thermometer
has ascertained ; and, that a considerable share of this at least
must be invisible, follows from comparing together the quantity
of light and heat which are stopped by different glasses. The
bluish-white one, for instance, stops 86 rays of light, and 625 of
heat. Hence, if only visible rays of heat came from the candle,
a glass stopping more light, as for instance the dark-red glass,
which stops 999,8, ought to stop all heat whatsoever; but the
fact is, that it eyen stops one hundred rays less than the former. This instance alone shews plainly, that the existence of invi-
sible terrestrial heat in the flame of a candle, is proved ; while,
on the contrary, heat derived from rays that are visible, remains
yet to be established, by those who would maintain that there
are any such. But, for the sake of argument, let us endeavour
to explain how visible rays of heat may be reconciled with the
contents of our 6th table.
