Note that the order- 3 Evo | ution of the vert eb rate ‘Ba u pla n ’
ing of the branches in the vertical direction is arbitrary, and here :

they are arranged to make room for the boxes describing the
innovations of highest interest for the human lineage. This pro-
duces what appears on the right edge like a ‘Scala Nature’ from
sponges to humans, but it is not meant to imply a scale of pro-
gress towards higher complexity. In fact, such a tree could be
constructed for any species of interest, resulting in a schematic
where that species is at the top. The boxes in figure 2 summarize my current attempt at
reconstructing a sequence of evolutionary changes that will
be used to guide the rest of this article. In an earlier publication
[8], | focused on early stages from the first multicellular animals
to stem vertebrates.
