(e) No. 2 terrace

No. 2 terrace is a conspicuous feature along all the rivers except the Sherbourne. The
wide spreads of it at Leamington and Warwick are by no means level in cross-section, and
the height above alluvium may be estimated between 20 and 30 ft. in different places:
Upstream from here there is the same difference in behaviour between the Avon-Sowe on
the one hand and the Leam-Itchen on the other as there was with No. 4. In the first case,
the terrace approaches the alluvium towards the river’s source, and at Rugby it is only
12 ft. high and not easily separable from No. 1, whereas in the second case it keeps almost
parallel to the alluvium and is still 25 ft. above it at Snowford Bridge on the Itchen.

At no place is No. 2 terrace worked for gravel, so that I can add no new facts concerning
either the thickness of the deposit or its fauna. The latter, of course, is conspicuously ‘cold’,
and from many places between the Severn and Leamington has yielded Elephas primigenius
and Tichorhinus antiquitatus abundantly and Rangifer tarandus sparingly.

(f) The relationship of No. 3 terrace to No. 2 and No, 4

Two opposed suggestions have been made concerning the relative age of the deposits of
terrace. Tomlinson (1925, p. 159; 1935, p. 459) suggests that the deposits of No. 3 are older
than those of No. 4, both belonging to a continuous warm-climate aggradation. No. 3 has
yielded Hippopotamus, Elephas antiquus (possibly), Unio littoralis and Belgrandia marginata,
while No. 4 (but so far as is known, only the lower part of it) has produced Unio littoralis
and Corbicula consobrina. These gravels were then entrenched with two halt stages, the first
