This assumption is the Dirac postulate. At the same time, the present interpretation (or Bohrâ€™s interpretation, which is not different in
this respect) does not imply a uniform or otherwise unified character of the ultimate, RWR-type,
reality considered in QM, a character only manifesting itself differently in quantum experiments. In fact, this assumption would be manifestly in conflict with strong RWR interpretations, which
preclude any conception of this reality and, hence, that of its unity or oneness, uniform or not. It is true that, as inconceivable, this reality cannot be assumed to conform to any concept of
multiplicity either. It cannot be conceived either as single or as multiple.
