Hence it follows that erythrozym, after having once
been precipitated from its watery solution, even by alcohol, cannot again be dissolved
in water. The liquid obtained by treating erythrozym with water and filtering, con-
tains a small quantity of a substance, which, from its reactions, I conclude to be
pectic acid, or some body nearly allied to it. In fact, the method of preparing ery-
throzym implies that all substances contained in the watery extract of madder, ins0-
luble in alcohol, must be found mixed with it ; but since the erythrozym itself by pre-
cipitation with alcohol becomes insoluble in water, these substances may afterwards
be easily remoyed by treating with water. Tf the watery liquid in which the erythro-
zym is contained in a state of suspension be boiled, a sort of coagulation takes place,
and the erythrozym separates in the shape of dirty red flocks, while the liquid retains
a reddish colour. The same effect is produced by adding alcohol or salts, such as
