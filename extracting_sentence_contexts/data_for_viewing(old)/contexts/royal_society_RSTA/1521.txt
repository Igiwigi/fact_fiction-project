an excellent example [50].

In a recent study, for example, the effect of box size on simulations of protein dynamics in
water was reported [51]; the authors reported that calculated values of various properties, such
as the stabilities of the unliganded and liganded states of human haemoglobin and the density
or number of hydrogen bonds per water molecule, changed systematically with an increase in
box size; the authors maintained that a surprisingly large box of 150 A was required to obtain
meaningful results. Although at first sight, this dependency on the box size appears to be an
example of a systematic error in the simulation, it is in fact caused by a lack of reproducibility in
the study which becomes manifest when random errors are taken into account [52]. Indeed, the
ensuing debate [51-54] highlights the importance of setting up systems correctly for simulation
and, more importantly, applying ensemble approaches to get statistically significant results. The
issue at stake is also important for the evaluation of the reliability of scientific research, as is clear
from the follow up studies by the debaters [45,55]. As we noted above, without first handling the
stochastic errors, it is not possible to assess correctly the nature and magnitude of the systematic
errors, and to interpret findings convincingly.

3. Uncertainty quantification in molecular dynamics simulations

Although it was recognized more than two decades ago that one-off classical molecular dynamics
simulations do not generate consistent protein conformations [56,57], systematic investigation
