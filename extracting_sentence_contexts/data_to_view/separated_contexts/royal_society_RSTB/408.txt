V. HORSLEY ON THE EXCITATION OF THE

Having now described the methods of investigation, we will now give in detail the
results obtained by stimulating (A) the cortex, (B) the internal capsule. In the description of the representation of movements obtained in the cortex we
have thought it best to arrange the facts in the order in which the cortical areas were
stimulated. This arrangement was similar to what we employed in the Bonnet Monkey,
beginning with the foci for the smaller movements before proceeding to those for the
larger, as we found by experience that the former were the first to lose their exci-
tability. We shall therefore describe the different movements in the following order :—

Movements of the Eyes and Eyelids.
