Zon the completeness of the meteorite preserved at Gotha, both as regards its form and its
Qerust, while he adds that the Naunhof mass must have been far too great to allowof its being
transported, and, indeed, that it had never been rediscovered. It is in every way probable
that the material STROMEYER really had to work upon was from a Saxon locality, and in
fact a specimen from a fall, to which the Rittersgriin and Breitenbach siderolites belong.
Brermgavert believes the fall in question to have been the © Eisenregen” which occurred
at Whitsuntide, 1164, in Saxony, when a mass of iron fell in the town of Meissen $.
An inspection of a polished surface of either of these masses reveals the iron in patches
of irregular form, which exhibit the characteristic erystalline structure of meteoric irons
