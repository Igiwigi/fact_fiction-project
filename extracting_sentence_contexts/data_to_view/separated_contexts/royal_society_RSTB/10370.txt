Nor do other memory tasks used with infants apply to SL. Although deferred imitation requires infants to retain
sequences of events, such learning is thought to rely on explicit
as opposed to implicit memory [22]. The fact that infants do not
reliably learn transitions between arbitrarily related events in
deferred imitation until 22 months of age [22], long after they
show evidence of SL, adds further concern that deferred imita-
tion recruits a different memory system than SL. To address the
question of retention of SL in infants, I turn to work on reten-
tion of the kind of information that is likely to involve SL
in natural language and the handful of studies of long-term
retention of SL. Evidence suggests that perceptual prerequisites of SL begin
prenatally.
