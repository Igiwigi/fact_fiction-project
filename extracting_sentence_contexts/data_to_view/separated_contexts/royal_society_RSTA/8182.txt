It is found that in every case complete indication regarding
the existence of the storms in the sea can be obtained from the microseisms. The
analysis shows that some of the storms, which are declared to be severe from meteoro-
logical evidence, did not produce very well-marked microseisms. This was apparently
due to the fact that some storms are of very small diameter and affect only a small area
of the sea. The energy communicated to the surface of the earth in such cases is small
and the microseisms recorded at a distant Observatory are feeble. When recorded
under the conditions adopted in the Colaba Observatory, the microseisms must be 2

valuable aid to the forecaster, particularly for storms in the Arabian Sea, where informa-

tion from meteorological sources are often very meagre.
