atoms and a permanent negative charge on the sp° carbon atoms.

An analysis of how motion of the calcium atom influences charge transfer and, as a result, the
distribution of charge between the two hemispheres of Ca@CggHy is shown in figure 6. Focusing
on the left hemisphere, with the calcium atom at —1.1 A (energy minimum), the charge averaged
across the different isomers is approximately —0.9e. Moving to the energy maximum (—0.2 A), the
charge drops slightly to approximately —0.86e, and when the atom finally moves to an energy
minimum in the right hemisphere (at +1.2 A), the charge drops still further in magnitude to
approximately —0.3e. These changes mean that the charge on the left hemisphere switches by
approximately 0.6e as the calcium atom moves between the two energy minima. The presence of
hydrogen atoms causes the carbon shell to become asymmetric during the optimization process;
an effect due primarily to a change in hybridization where those carbon atoms that are bonded to
hydrogen go from being sp* to sp*. More significant, however, is the fact that sp® carbon atoms
are much less electronegative than sp* hybrids. Interestingly, the charge maximum (—1.03e) in the
left hemisphere does not coincide with the energy minimum, but is reached at —0.75 A; however,
for the right hemisphere there is a much closer correspondence between charge maximum and
energy minimum. Figure 7 shows how charge on the fullerene cage responds to the formation of
[Ca@CgoH4]*. As for figure 6, the data are presented as a function of the position of the calcium
atom on the x-axis. In contrast with the response from neutral Ca@CgoHy, the data now show
evidence of a very definite switch between negative and positive charge density; however, the
