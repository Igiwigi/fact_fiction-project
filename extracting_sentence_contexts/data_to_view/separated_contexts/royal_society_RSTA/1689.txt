Now by [12, Theorem 10], the operator Gog generates a Cy-semigroup on Xo, hence the proof is
complete. P|

Note that for B defined in (6.3) the restriction Bo := B|x, is unbounded on Xp = Co[—1,0). In
fact, if we define f(r) := (—r)* for r € [—1,0], then f € Xp \ D(Bo). For our problems with dynamic boundary conditions theorems 4.3 and 5.1 now give the
following. Corollary 6.5.
