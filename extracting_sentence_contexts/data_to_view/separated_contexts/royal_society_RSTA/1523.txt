SIM illuminates the sample with a periodic interference pattern with a periodicity close to the
optical diffraction limit of the optical imaging system. A very important feature of SIM is the extremely efficient use of available photons, which,
combined with high imaging speed and new evaluation algorithms, also makes SIM one of the
most suitable techniques for live cell imaging. SIM bypasses the Abbe/Rayleigh limit by exploiting the fact that fluororphores (as opposed
to scattering particles) react to excitation intensity by a proportional emission of incoherent
fluorescence. Super-resolution is achieved in SIM by the illumination of the object with a periodic
sinusoidal pattern. This multiplication in the spatial domain correlates to a convolution in the
frequency domain.
