682 DR. W. B. CARPENTER ON THE STRUCTURE, PHYSIOLOGY, AND

ilustration in the fact that LAMARCK, in the first edition of his © Systeme des Anima
sans Vertebres* (1801), ranged them, as Lixxnzvs had done, among his « Polypes
rayons coralligenes,” by the side of Forgonia, Umbellularia, and Pennatula; apparently
under the influence of the original suggestion of ELL1s, and of the erroneous surmise of
GvrrTaRD, who, however, nowhere goes $0 far as to affirm that the branching arms of
his * Palmier marin ” actually bear Polypes. Tt is not a little surprising that, with the
very specimen of the recent Pentacrinus Caput-Medus& described by GUeTTARD under
his eyes in the Museum at the Jardin des Plantes, LAMARCK $hould have failed to TCCOg»
nize its close relationship to Antedon, a type which, as we shall prescntly see, specially
attracted his attention. The first among post-Linnean zoologists who recognized the claim of this form of
Sea-star to a distinct generic rank, on account of that difference from all others in its
plan of structure which had been recognized by Linvyp and Lixck, seems to have been
M. FREMINVILLE!, who in 1811 thus clearly defined the genus, to which he gave the
designation Antedon :—* Animal libre, a corps discoide, calcaire en dessus, gdlatineux
en dessous, environn6 de deux rangees de rayons articul6s, pierreux, perc6s dans leur
largeur d'un trou central; cenx du rang supcerieur plus courts, simples, et d'6gale
grosseur dans toute leur longueur ; ceux du rang inferieur plus longs, allant en dimi-
nuant de la base a la pointe, et garnis dans toute leur longueur Vappendices alternes
6galement articul6s ; bouche infcrieure et centrale ; ”—referring for his illustration to
the figure in the © Encyclopedie Mcthodique * (pl. exxiv. fig. 6), which obvyiously repre-
sents the Stella decacnemos rosacea of Lixck.
