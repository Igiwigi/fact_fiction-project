The subscript on B indicates that all B-cells in this
population are naive: they have very low affinity for viral proteins. This process is interpreted as
allocation of a population of B-cells and not production of the cells themselves. This is somewhat of
a computational fiction and is an artefact of the simplifying choice as with the virus population to
not track individual cells, but only their count (or in this case, their affinity). The process therefore
proceeds immediately, at infinite rate. The function of B-cells is to produce antibodies.
