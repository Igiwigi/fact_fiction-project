Estimates of the carbon content of all 23
fossil fuel reservoirs including unconventional fossil fuels such as tar sands, tar shale and various 18
gas reservoirs that can be tapped with developing technology [114] imply that CO2 conceivably =
could reach a level as high as 16 times the 1950 atmospheric amount. In that event, figure 7 al
suggests a global mean warming approaching 25°C, with much larger warming at high latitudes :g
(see electronic supplementary material, figure S6). The result would be a planet on which humans [8
could work and survive outdoors in the summer only in mountainous regions [115,116]—and :
there they would need to contend with the fact that a moist stratosphere would have destroyed
the ozone layer [117].

6. Earth system sensitivity

GHG and surface albedo changes, which we treated as specified climate forcings in evaluating
fast-feedback climate sensitivity, are actually slow climate feedbacks during orbit-instigated
Pleistocene glacial-interglacial climate swings. Given that GHG and albedo feedbacks are both
strong amplifying feedbacks, indeed accounting by themselves for most of the global Pleistocene
climate variation, it is apparent that today’s climate sensitivity on millennial time scales must be
substantially larger than the fast-feedback sensitivity.
