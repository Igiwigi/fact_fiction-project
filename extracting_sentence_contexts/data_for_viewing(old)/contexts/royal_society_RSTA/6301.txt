removed by linearly regressing the annual mean time series at each grid point onto a smoothed
time series of global-mean (60° S-60° N) SST, which we smooth with a 10-year running mean.
Hence, this method removes a temporally nonlinear estimate of global SST signals. The resulting
SSTs are then averaged over the North Atlantic basin (e.g. 0-65° N and 0-75° W). All AMV
indices are subsequently smoothed by a 10-year rolling mean. Note that due to the use of 10-year
smoothed global-mean temperatures to remove long-term globally forced changes from the AMV-
Glob, this restricts the available years to 1860-2009 in CMIP6 historical runs, and comparison with
the observations is done over this period for both AMV indices.

In CMIP6 historical simulations, we assume that we can decompose the total AMV into
internal and external components, which we will call iAMV and fAMV. In particular, we
assume that, for each model separately, the total AMV is the sum of the iAMV and fAMV (ie.
AMV =iAMV + fAMV). By exploiting the fact that making an ensemble mean should remove


the internal variability to reveal the common forced response, we first compute [AMV for each
model individually by using the ensemble mean SST. To compute the iAMV, we compute the
relevant AMV index from each member separately, and then make this index relative to the fAMV
index for that model; in other words, the iAMV for each individual member is defined as the
residual variability (e.g. AMV} = AMV; — fAMV"™, where n is the ensemble member and m1 is
the model). This method of separating externally forced and internal (or residual) variability has
been used previously [92,96] and is often referred to as ‘de-meaning’ the ensemble. Note that,
when characterizing the iAMV relationships for each model, we compute the desired metric for
each member separately and then take the ensemble mean of the metric. When computing the
AMV-Glob index for each ensemble member, we always use the model’s ensemble mean global-
