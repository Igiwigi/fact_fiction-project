formation of artificial ice, by the machine of Mr. Harris0N referred to in my paper, I
have seen little solid stars formed, by freezing, which were the exact counterparts of the
little liquid stars formed by melting. So far as I can see, the complementary character
of the phenomena is perfectly natural, and presents no difficulty to the mind in con-
ceiving of it.

When the beam is intense, and its action continued for some time, the flowers expand,
= 80 as to form liquid plates within the mass. Looked at edgeways, these liquid spaces
S appear like fine lines; which proves that the melting is not symmetrical laterally and
© vertically, but that the ice melts in the planes of freezing much more readily than at
5 right angles to these planes.
= 1f an air-bubble exists within ice, and if the ice melts at the concave surface of this
E bubble, as might be expected from the foregoing facts, the ice will s0 yield that the
= composite cell of air and water will not be spherical, even though the bubble of air may
= originally have been 80. In the planes of freezing the mass yields most readily, and the
2 cavity containing the air and water will appear as if Fattened by « force acting perpen-
=Z dicular to these planes. This is not a deduction merely, but an observation which I
