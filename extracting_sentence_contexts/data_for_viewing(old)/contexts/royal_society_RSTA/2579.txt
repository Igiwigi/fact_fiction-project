are telling to their students in the elementary courses. Thus, until very recently most of
the proofs in undergraduate Analysis courses suffered from systematic delusions related
to the incorrect use of infinity, that survived from the early twentieth century.

A crucial fact, used to establish the equivalence of continuity in terms of sequences and in terms
of neighbourhoods, is that any infinite set contains a countable subset. Here is the usual proof,
to which generations of students were exposed. Let X be an infinite set. Since it is infinite, it is
non-empty, and thus contains a point x;. Then the set X \ {x1} is still infinite and thus contains
a point x2 # x1. Proceeding in the same way, we eventually get a countable subset {x1,x2,x3,..-}
of X.

This ‘proof’ is short and crystal clear. This is why colleagues in Analysis used to overreact
when challenged by the simple fact that in this form, without additional assumptions, the proof is
completely wrong—as are most other naive arguments using ’...’ in similar sloppy fashion.

What this argument does indeed prove is that X contains an arbitrarily large finite subset
{x1,...,Xn}, which is called mathematical induction. Using some form of the axiom of choice, one
can within another quarter of a page derive that X contains a countable subset. However, the
result is obviously wrong without such an assumption. In fact, Paul Cohen constructed models of
ZF where infinite sets do not have to be Dedekind infinite. In other words, any such fake ‘proof’,
that does not make explicit mention of the axiom of choice, is grossly misleading.

e There is no general consensus as to who was the first to give a correct and complete proof
of d’Alembert’s 1746 theorem that C is algebraically closed (FTHA). Subsequent proofs
were proposed by Euler in 1759 and by Lagrange in 1771. However, mathematicians are
