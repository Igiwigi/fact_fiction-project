I am glad to
have this opportunity of thanking him for the kindness which prompted him to take
a great deal of trouble (for the animals are never common, and are very rare at this
time of the year) to. oblige a fellow naturalist. I shall first describe the organ itself, and then give the reasons which seem to me
conclusive evidence that it is a respiratory organ, and then state the bearings which
it seems to me to have upon other morphological facts. The series of organs which, I hope to show, perform the function of respiration in
Scutigera, are arranged in the middle line at the posterior end of each dorsal scale. They are best seen in a specimen which has been preserved in corrosive sublimate
acidulated with hydrochloric acid.
