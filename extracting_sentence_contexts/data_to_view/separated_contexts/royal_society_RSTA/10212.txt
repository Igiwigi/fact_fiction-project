The object of
such experiments is to test a proposed pressure-equation, or to find materials for a
new one ; but consistently with this we may use a form, known to represent the facts
approximately, to supply a subordinate correction. A careful discussion of the available data relating to various gases has led
DD. BerruEtor to the conclusion that the facts at low pressure are not to be
reconciled with VAN DER WAALS’ equation, either in its original form or as modified
by Craustus (i.¢., with the insertion of the absolute temperature in the denominator
of the cohesive term).

As an example, let us apply this formula to find for oxygen what change must be
