The obtained results from both series (simulated and measured) for NP and SP
creeks are summarized in table 1. In this table, 1? is the correlation coefficient and represents
the goodness of fit of observed daily maximum discharge Qg,obs to simulated daily maximum
discharge Qasim, and observed monthly discharge, Qmobs to simulated monthly discharge,
Qm,sim. The measured discharge values are maximum values, while the simulated ones are
in fact the maximum values estimated by the simulation and taking into account the daily
amplitude of variation of discharge. This amplitude is driven by changes in temperature and
incidental radiation. Finally, the mean discharges were calculated taking into consideration the
daily variation of simulated discharge (figure 4).
