First, since any direction
is as likely as any other, as many of the lines are parallel to any given direction as to
any other. Consider one of these systems of parallels; let them be cut by any infinite
perpendicular. As this infinite system of parallels is drawn at random, they are as
thickly disposed along any part of the perpendicular as along any other; the inter-
sections being in fact random points on the perpendicular. Hence it is easily seen that,
for all purposes of calculation, the assemblage of lines may be thus conceived. Divide
the angular space round any point into a number of equal angles 39, and for every direc-
tion let the plane be ruled with an infinity of equidistant parallel lines, the common
infinitesimal distance being the same for every set, of parallels.
