(b) Flexible displays

In the early days of flat panels, there was some concern about the glass
substrates. The risk of breakage was, perhaps, emphasized, and there were some
experiments with plastic sheets. In time, however, glass became the standard,
and there it has remained. However, at some stage defence users again became
conscious of their dependence on an admittedly fragile component, and began
funding research on plastic substrates. They took this initiative further, asking
for a display that was flexible, with a vision of field maps that were portable,
and could be rolled up. In fact, a form of flexible display had been available
to the consumer for many years, a temperature indicator containing cholesteric
LC. These were marketed widely, and since they were cheap, the customer
rarely complained when their ability to read the temperature lapsed after some
months. That, however, was symptomatic of the problem of using plastics. Their
ability as a moisture barrier is far less satisfactory than that of glass, whose
main weakness in that regard is the adhesive seal between the two sheets. The
requirement for a display substrate is a water vapour transmittance less than
10° m~?d-! and an oxygen transmittance less than 10-° mlm? d7', whereas
the best common plastics, PET and PEN, are several orders of magnitude worse
than this.

The demand for moisture and oxygen barrier coatings has attracted much
