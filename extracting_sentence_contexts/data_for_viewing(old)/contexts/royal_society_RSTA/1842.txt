As in the astrophysical Hawking case—certainly as in the Unruh effect—in this generalized

derivation the emitted radiation is thermal and its effective temperature depends on the
acceleration of the moving medium [41], this is

BT = (3.22)

This equation is the central piece of the general theory of Hawking radiation that can be applied
to any system: astrophysical or analogue. Despite the fact that the dispersionless case was
considered in this derivation, in analogue systems the presence of some kind of dispersion is
unavoidable, which usually leads to a change in the spectrum, the Hawking spectrum may
no longer be thermal. In the astrophysical case it is not clear if a dispersion mechanism exists,
but if space-time discretization were true, dispersion effects could be introduced into Hawking
radiation theory as in the analogue systems [42,43].

The most efficient way of solving the Bogoliubov transformations for several in- and out-
modes relies on the scattering matrix formalism. This method has been used to derive the
Hawking spectrum for several systems, including the optical case that is a highly dispersive
system [11,35,36,44,45].
