able it to support the keeper, and frequently not that, even when the keeper
was immediately replaced after a rupture.

This 8light retentive property of the soft iron for magnetism, after a rupture,
I conceive not properly to belong to the iron itself, but to be caused by the

iron being mixed more or less with steel. The fact of iron retaining a trifling
portion of magnetism has long been known to those engaged in the science of
electro-magnetism, as also its capriciousness in developing magnetic energies.
Among those who, I know, have particularly noticed these facts, I ought to
mention my friends, Dr. Dausexy, Mr. Marsn, and Mr. STURGEoN.

27. When I first undertook to perform the series of experiments, the results
of which haye been briefly detailed, I had in view a different object from that
I have since obtained ; for I thought the soft iron with its keeper resembled
in a manner a closed voltaic circuit. But subsequent observations have led
me to conclude, that the whole phenomenon resolves itself simply into a novel
case of complex induction. As thus, the horse-shoe of soft iron is made a
strong magnet, by the inducing effects of the electric current transmitted along
the helical coils of copper surrounding it. The keeper, being a bar of soft
iron, is made a magnet by the inductive influence of the magnetism, active at,
the time in the soft iron horse-shoe, and becoming powerful by the poles of
