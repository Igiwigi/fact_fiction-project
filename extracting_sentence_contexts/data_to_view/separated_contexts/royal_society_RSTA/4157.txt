A few words should be said about the optical arrangements, It was for our
purpose most important to have a good image of the spark in coincidence with the
slit. As we confined our investigation principally to that part of the spectrum
which, with glass prisms and lenses, is photographically most intense, the lenses were
specially made for us by Messrs. Zetss at Jena, the chromatic and spherical aberrations
being corrected for the region F to H of the solar spectrum. When it is required to
form a spark image on the slit, sufficient attention is not always given to the fact
that lenses are generally constructed to be used with a parallel beam of light. The
aberrations introduced when objects at small distances are to be focussed, are some-
times considerable, and had to be avoided in our experiments. We asked Messrs,
Zeiss therefore to make a lens of 4 centims.
