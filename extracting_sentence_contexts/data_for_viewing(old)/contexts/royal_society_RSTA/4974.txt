Fisher, like all the best statisticians, was motivated by practical problems. He wanted to
develop statistical methods which could handle the sort of data and the kinds of questions he
encountered in real life, rather than promoting a mathematical idealization. And we find that,
although this paper is ‘on the mathematical foundations’, it includes discussion of real examples.

The way he used real practical problems is illustrated, on a small scale, by the way he corrected
an assertion made by the astronomer Sir Arthur Eddington.

In parallel with his work leading towards likelihood, Fisher was exploring the notion of (what
we now think of as characterizing the frequentist school of statistics) evaluating estimators using
their sampling properties, such as the consistency and efficiency mentioned above. Eddington
claimed that the best estimator of the standard error of a normal distribution was the mean
of the absolute deviations. Fisher showed [12] that this was not the case, and in fact that
the mean of the squared deviations contained ‘the whole of the information respecting’ the
standard error. As he said in Fisher [1, p. 315]: ‘the discussions of theoretical statistics may be
regarded as alternating between problems of estimation and problems of distribution. In the first
place a method of calculating one of the population parameters is devised from common-sense
considerations: we next require to know its probable error, and therefore an approximate solution
of the distribution, in samples, of the statistic is calculated. It may then become apparent that
other statistics may be used as estimates of the same parameter. When the probable errors of
these statistics are compared, it is usually found that, in large samples, one particular method



of calculation gives a result less subject to random errors that those given by other methods
