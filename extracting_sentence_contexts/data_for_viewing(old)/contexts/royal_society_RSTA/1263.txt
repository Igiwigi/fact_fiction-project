magnetic perturbations may give rise to, through the generation of the ponderomotive force, the
well-known FIP (first ionization potential) effect, an elemental abundance anomaly observed in
the corona of the Sun and other Sun-like stars [36]. In recent years, and most notably with the in
situ observations expected from the Solar Orbiter mission [37], the FIP effect has acquired new
relevance as a powerful diagnostic of the solar wind, especially useful for linking the solar wind
to its source regions [35,38].

Many authors have reported [39-44] magnetic field oscillations with periods in the range
3-5 min and oscillation amplitudes ranging from 10 G to a few hundreds G in sunspots,
concentrated either in patches [45] or at the umbra-penumbra boundary [42,46]. Very recently,
extremely long period (up to 60 h) magnetic oscillations were also reported in a number of
sunspots [47]. However, the interpretation of these fluctuations in terms of intrinsic magnetic
oscillations is debated [48,49]. Spurious magnetic oscillations may in fact arise from the cross-
talk between other physical quantities. In particular, in the presence of a vertical gradient of
the magnetic field (as is the case for many magnetic structures in the solar atmosphere), opacity
effects can also play a significant role [49]. Indeed, due to opacity changes, the height of formation
of the spectral line changes too, hence the sampled height varies from which the information
is extracted. Since the magnetic field is not constant, such variable height sampling results
in apparent fluctuations of the magnetic flux. A telltale sign of such a situation arising from
opacity effects is that the apparent magnetic field fluctuations are in phase (or out-of-phase)
with density fluctuations (or diagnostics derived thereof [32]). Analyses of the phase relations
between magnetic field diagnostics, such as the circular polarization (CP) of the spectral line, and
other independent diagnostics (e.g. intensity, Doppler velocity etc.) acquired at two atmospheric
heights are useful to distinguish real magnetic oscillations from opacity effects and cross-talk
[22,32,42,46], and to correctly identify different MHD modes [22,50-53]. An important aspect of
