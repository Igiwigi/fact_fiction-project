Since dE(n;)=Y;(r;dy;) + Z(ydr,)
* The conditions [a b;]=1, [a;, b5]=0, [b, b]=0, [a;, ]=0 will give, as is easily een, hn Ye

equations; and the analogous conditions (21.), art. 9, in which the summation refers to the numerators of the
differential coefficients, will give the same number, so that upon the whole we hall apparently have 3n*—z
equations, to determine the 2r* partial coefficients required.

It is not difficult to make mistakes in this subject. I was for some time under the impression that the pro-
blem could be solved when any n independent integrals were given. Even the illustrious Jaconr himself
appears to have been misled, at first sight, as to the consequences of PorssoN's theorem (art. 22.). See the
beginning of M. BznTzaxy's Memoir mentioned above ; I do not know the fact from any other source.

and E(y,dr,)=dX (by (5.)),

we have E\(z;dy,) =d(—X+E((a;3;)),

an equation which must become identical when z,, z,, &c. on each side are expressed
in terms of y,, ys, &c. But the right side being then a complete differential of a

function of y,, 44, &c., the left side must be 80 also; hence the conditions Fa =Z musf
