regime d= O(1) considered here may, however, apply to dryland ecosystems on flat non-sandy
soil with high infiltration rate and fast biomass spread due to seed dispersal, a possibility that
merits investigation in future work.

The results obtained in this study are largely numerical. A detailed understanding of the
results remains to be elucidated, however, since the techniques of geometric singular perturbation
theory used so successfully in the regime d > 1 in [13,14] are inapplicable when d = O(1). Instead
the key to this understanding appears to be provided by the case dm = 2, i.e. the quadruple zero
singularity described by equation (A 20). This Swift-Hohenberg equation captures the behaviour
of the system in the vicinity of dm = 2, a codimension-two singularity that serves as an organizing
centre for the formation of a large variety of complex LSs [53,54]. Moreover, these structures
are expected to persist as |dm — 2| increases, and so may potentially provide insight for other
ecologically relevant parameter regimes. In fact, the appearance of a quadruple zero bifurcation
is by no means unique to the GS model or for that matter to other vegetation models, but is
a property of reaction-diffusion systems in general. For example, this bifurcation organizes the
properties of both bright and dark solitons within the Lugiato-Lefever equation used to model
nonlinear optical systems [42].
