The terms frp and fgppp correspond to the third- and fourth-order derivatives of the PES with
respect to the reaction mode, respectively, and w, is the vibrational frequency of this mode. This
formulation of 1D SCTST assumes that not only the coupling terms in an anharmonic constant
matrix but also the coupling terms in the third- and fourth-order derivatives between the reaction
mode and other modes are zero. Previous studies [12] have shown that inclusion of the coupling
terms in the third- and fourth-order derivatives in fact produces rate constants that are in worse
agreement to the FD SCTST results. The deep-tunnelling correction proposed by Wagner et al. [14] is also used in the current study. It improves the potential energy barrier used in an SCTST calculation in the low-energy region.
