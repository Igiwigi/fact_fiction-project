These ‘bump’ universes in MV,(P4(1,2)) are the only ones which yield I¢q)(v) =0. However, we see from equation (3.19) that it should be possible to find universes in MV, (P4(1,2))
in which the middle exponential branch exists and for which I) (¢) is as close to zero as we wish. The fact that we can construct universes with I-q)(y)=0 seems a bit disconcerting. For
example, we can take an exponential solution g = wet, tj <t <tr and adjoin to it an exponential
‘bump’, given by
gy =aexp(Bt), th<t<ty
gi =a exp(Ait), Hh <t<ty
$2 = a2 exp(A2t), fy <b <ts
gy =aexp(Bt), fg St Sty,

Qpi= (3.20)

where fj < ty <tz <f3 <tf, and y/(H) = 9} (t), 9} (t2) = 94(t2), 93 (ts) = ¢'(ts), with all w’s and f’s
chosen so that y, > 0 where it is continuous. It can be shown using an argument similar to the
one employed to compute [() for the g solution given in equation (3.12), that the value of the
action I¢(1 will be the same for g and gp» when computed for tf; < t < ty.
