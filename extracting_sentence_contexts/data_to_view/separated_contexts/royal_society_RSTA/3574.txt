importantly, the equilibrium window, which has been associated with large periods of tumour
mass latency, is practically imperceptible for f =1.0 and has completely vanished for f = 0.05. We have again computed time series, showing that transients occur in the equilibrium region,
sometimes as long as those appearing before in the equilibrium, but generally shorter (figure 8). In fact, the equilibrium window and the escape zone drawn in figure 7a overlap. It seems that
the equilibrium region appearing in the reference scenario has been swept under the elimination
region. Once more, the results confirm the requisite of a relatively delicate balance between the
mechanisms that maintain the cytotoxic destruction of the immune system and the growth of the =
tumour, in order to keep it at low cell numbers for long periods of time. : 3
