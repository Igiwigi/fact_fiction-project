for normal animals on white in daylight is also here reproduced. It will be observed
that curves B and C show no significant difference. The state of darkening attained
is the same, and the velocity of melanophore expansion is the same. Now the curves
for blind animals in fig. 3 show that in lamplight these animals remain pale, which
means that this light is not sufficiently intense to stimulate the dermal photoreceptors.
This being so, it follows that the darkening of the normals on black in lamplight (curve
C, fig. 5) is due almost exclusively to impulses proceeding from the retinal photoreceptors,
whereas the darkening of blind animals in daylight (curve B) is due exclusively to
impulses proceeding from the dermal photoreceptors. The fact that the stimulation
of two different sets of receptors has exactly the same end. effect strongly suggests
that the co-ordinating mechanism in the two is similar, and since the dermal
response is an inhibition, the retinal response to a light absorbing background must
be a similar inhibition.

When, however, the response of normal animals on white in daylight (curve A)
is considered, it is apparent that the conditions are such that the dermal response
should occur (cf. curve B). It is prevented from occurring by the stimulation of the
retinal receptors by light from a light-scattering background, and the animals remain
pale. It seems reasonable to regard this phenomenon as an inhibition of inhibition.
If this suggestion is provisionally accepted, the shape of curve A becomes intelligible.
It is consonant with physiological principles that a primary inhibition should become
