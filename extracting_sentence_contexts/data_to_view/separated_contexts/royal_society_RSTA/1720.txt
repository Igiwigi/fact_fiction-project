Inall our applications, 2 will be a (non-empty) open subset of R¢ (with the Lebesgue measure)
and V will be a subspace of the first Sobolev space

H}(Q):= (ue L?(Q): du €L*(Q) for all j=1,...,d},

where we understand the derivative oyu in the sense of distributions. The space H}(Q) is a
sublattice of L?(2), which means that u+,u~ € H!(@) whenever u € H'(Q). In fact, we have
aj(ut) = Lwee:u(w)>0) 9; for each u € H1(Q) [46, Proposition 4.4]. The following lemma, which we quote from [47, Lemma 11.1.1], is the key to apply
Proposition 5.5(b) to forms defined on subspaces of H1(Q). Lemma 5.6.
