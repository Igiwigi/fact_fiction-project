+1% 12", the relative parallactic displacement of the moon's disk at the two stations

of Rivabellosa and Desierto de las Palmas, ascertained as nearly as the want of defi-
nition in the photograph obtained at the latter station permitted. It is probably less
by about 2” than the true displacement.


In conclusion, the two totality-pictures No. 25 and No. 26, when reduced to a suit-
able size and placed in the stereoscope, No. 25 on the left, and No. 26 on the right.
afford a very beautiful view of the phenomena of totality, and one which could not. be
enjoyed by mortal eyes in looking at the real eclipse. Not only does the stereoscope
render evident the fact of the moon being an object interyening between the observer
and the sun, but it als shows it as a sphere. The triplication of the prominences
must be corrected in No. 26; but any attempt to complete the lunar disk by painting
on a poxitive copy, as «, 3, and y photographs, the originals of Plates X., XT., and X11.,
is immediately detected, and the corrected lunar disk appears perfectly flat. Tn placing
the photographs in the stereoscope, the prominence A must, be placed upwards. and at

A right angles to the line joining the centres of the photographs.
