This includes adding relevant data and parameters, e.g. force field definitions and initial particle
configurations for a multiscale molecular application. After Instantiation, the application is made operational at the target platform (e.g. cluster,
cloud or supercomputer, Deployment Step), upon which it is (initially) run (Execution Step). Deployment is complicated due to the fact that various single-scale models and their coupling
have to be orchestrated, potentially on a heterogeneous platform (CPU/GPU supercomputer)
or even multiple platforms (combining clusters or working in a cloud). After the initial run,
the application is usually subject to a cycle of further optimizations (Optimization Step) and
executions (or repetitions of earlier steps as needed). Optimization in the context of this paper
refers to bolstering the scientific and technical quality of the application such that it becomes
suitable for use in production runs.
