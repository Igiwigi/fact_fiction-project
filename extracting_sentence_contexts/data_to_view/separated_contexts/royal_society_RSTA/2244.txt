The standard formulation of contextuality applies only to cases where the distribution of
each observable is identical across contexts. This property of a system of measurements is called
consistent connectedness [5], marginal selectivity [6,7] or no-disturbance [8]. Dzhafarov and
Kujala have made persuasive arguments for extending contextuality to inconsistently connected
systems, including the fact that real experiments never eliminate all sources of contamination, and
that sample frequencies in finite datasets will generally not be equal even if the true generating
probabilities are [9-11]. Beyond these pragmatic considerations, it is of interest to know whether
contextuality can be usefully defined in cases where the distributions of observables are truly
different across contexts. This might enable contextuality analysis to be applied to other domains,
such as human cognition or behaviour [12-15].
