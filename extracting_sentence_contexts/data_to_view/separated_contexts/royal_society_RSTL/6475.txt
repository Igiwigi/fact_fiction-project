And I think the examples I gave of my method could leave no doubt
as to the comparative simplicity which resulted from it, and consequently comparative
utility of my analysis; an analysis which applies where there are more than three lives
concerned, and, in fact, where there are any number of lives to be considered. And
I may refer the reader to my solutions in that tract, to enable him to make the com-
parison. There were various other subjects in that paper, and one I mention in particular,
which is the problem to determine what would be the law of mortality between two
lives A, B, 0 that, 8hould it be known that they are both extinct, it would be an equal
chance which of them had died first; because that asmumption is made, in some of the
solutions above alluded to, by former writers, and for a short period would, in fact,
be approximatively true; and the solution of the problem showed that it could only be
accurately true where there was for each life a uniform equal decrement, though not
necessarily the same for both, or else a decrement for each life proceeding in geome-
trical proportion; the former law being in fact only an extreme case of the latter law.
1 may mention that there are s0me omissions in the printed s8olution of this problem,
which may lead the reader, if he does not enter properly into the analysis, to think it
faulty ; and that the paper on the whole stands in need of some errors in the printing of
it, and in one or two places of an incorrect portion of the manuscript sent to the printer,
being pointed out,

Art. 2. Since that paper was written, I ventured to communicate a paper to the Royal
Society, which it did me the honour to print in their Transactions of 1825, as a letter
to my late friend Fraxcrs Barry, Es9., on the nature of the functions expressive of the
law of human mortality expressed by the equation L,=d. a where L,, according to
my notation in my first paper, is the number of persons living, at the age z, out of the
number L, who were born & years previously. And as I use, from great preference, the
fluxional notation of our great NEwToX, instead of the furtive notation used on the Con-
tinent and now much used in England, my 4 does not denote the differential character.
