Skull of adult Urodeles and Batrachians. A reference to the figures in my papers on the Batrachian skull, and to those of
AmiMlystoma and Seironota in the present communication, will serve to show at once the
sharp distinctness between the two types, and yet their general resemblance. One great difficulty in comparing them arises from the fact that several of the Urodeles

o are perennibranchiate, and therefore permanently quasi-larval; there are no such Batra-
S chians, and one of that group, namely Pipa, is nearly abranchiate. © Looking at the skulls of adult (Caducibranchiate) Urodeles and Batrachians from the
Z surface we sce the following differences :—

S The roof-bones remain distinct in the Urodele; in the Batrachian the frontal and
= parietal of the same side coalesce.
