ENsxkoa, on the other hand, after deducing formule similar to (287),
(248), but without evaluating the coefficients 8,, y,, made a first approximation by
neglect of all these coefficients after + = 0, and arrived at the result f = 5 for rigid
elastic spheres. { This was due to the fact that such a use of (237), (248), as they
stand, involves not only the neglect of all the coefficients after 7 = 0, but also requires an
assumption as to the values of 8, y) themselves, as, for instance, that they are approxi-
mately the same as for Maxwellian molecules ; a comparison of (196) with Table IV. (p. 831) will show that this is far from being the case. It may readily be seen, however, that the method of my former paper required no

* At very low temperatures, however, the n power centre of force is the molecular model which gives
by far the best representation of the relation between » and T, in the case of helium; ¢f.
