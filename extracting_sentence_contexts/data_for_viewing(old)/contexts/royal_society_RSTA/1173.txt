In fact, the decay rate of the energy E(u, t) for all pairs of initial values (ug, 1) € D(A) x D(A'?)
(no restriction to 4!) is the same as the square of the decay rate of ||To(f)Ap 1 and, as a result,
we may apply the results in §3. It is then natural to say that the energy of (4.2) decays semi-
uniformly with rate r € Co(R+) if E(u, t) < Cr(t)*|| A(uo, 11) |? for all (uo, u1) € D(A) x D(AY?). Note
that E(u, t) = O(r(#)*) for some r€Co(R+) and for all initial values (19,11) € ¥ is equivalent to
exponential stability of the semigroup (7Zo(f));>0), and therefore to exponential decay of E(u, t) for
all solutions of (4.2).

Recall from §2 the discussion of circles contained in the spectrum of Co-semigroups. This
discussion implies in particular that the well-known alternative—either ||Zo(t)|| =1 for all t>0
or (Zp(t)):=0 is exponentially stable—holds here in a much stronger form: either (Jo(t));>0 is
exponentially stable or T € o (7o(t)) for almost every t > 0. Thus, unless (7o());>9 is exponentially
stable, its peripheral spectrum (in fact, even the peripheral essential spectrum) is as large as
possible for almost all values of t.

In order to link the study of (Zo(t));>0 with the results from the preceding sections, define the
quadratic operator pencil P(z):= 242B+A,z€C, with D(P(z)) = D(A). The next statement in
combination with the abstract decay criteria from §3 tells us that semi-uniform decay rates for the
energy E can be rewritten as operator norm estimates for P(z)! with z € iR; see [97, Lemma 4.6].

Theorem 4.1. There exists C > 1 such that, for all s € R with |s| > 1,

Note that for s € R one has ||P(is)~!|| = ||P(—is)~!|| and, similarly, ||R(is, Ag)|| = ||R(—is, Ag) ||, so
