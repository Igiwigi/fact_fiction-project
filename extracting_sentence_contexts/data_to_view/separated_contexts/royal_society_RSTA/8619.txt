The last result also shows why it is that the particular form pee for the kinetic
energy is irrelevant to the general dynamical discussion of paragraph 7. In fact,
if, instead of the form T used on that occasion, we had employed the general value
derived above

T= | div Ude
the part of the variation depending on this energy becomes the time integral of
aT | div 8U dr,

and the latter integral reduces toa surface integral over the infinitely distant boundary
and cannot therefore contribute anything in this general variational equation. Of course, from another point of view, the various forms of the theory here under
review, differ merely in assigning different distributions to the magnetic energy in the
field, each of these distributions being ultimately consistent with the same proper total
for this quantity; and the fact that they all lead to the same dynamical equations,
merely verifies a well-known result of analytical dynamics that the particular form of
expression for the energies of the system is immaterial to the ultimate dynamical
equations for the field inside a continuous medium. Of course the solutions of
boundary problems such as are, for example, involved in a specification of the energy
flux, depend essgntially on the particular form assumed for the energy distribution ;

and it has been shown on a previous occasion* that the only form of specification of
the energy distribution which is consistent with our usual ideas on these matters is
that which makes the density of the magnetic energy equal to B*/87, and as the
present discussion shows that our only hope of discrimination lies in that direction, we
may assume that the evidence in favour of this special form is conclusive, at least for
the present ; it is besides the only form in which the most general case is completely
representative of the distribution in any volume of the field without requiring the
introduction of boundary terms involving surface distributions.
