but quantum mechanics generates a scale, known as Agcp ~ 200 MeV.

The proton and neutrons are each made of three quarks (uud for the proton, udd for the
neutron). The mass parameters for the u,d quarks that appear in the SM as a consequence of
the BEH mechanism are very small (in the few MeV range) compared with the masses of protons
and neutrons, which are about 1000 MeV. Hence, the sum of two up and one down quark mass
parameters hardly account for the mass of the proton. The largest contribution come, in fact,
from the fact that the quarks and gluons are highly relativistic objects confined in a space of the
other of a fermi. A purely quantum phenomenon owing to QCD: the confinement of colour. As
mentioned before, a new scale is generated dynamically in this case. Even if the mass paraemters
of the up and down quarks were set to zero, we would still have protons and neutrons with
masses approximately equal to those we observe. Incidentally, what makes the study of the strong
interactions hard is the fact that

Agcpd > Mu, Mq-

A large fraction of the mass of protons and neutrons has its origin in this quantum phenomenon
of confinement.

Finally, we should take into account that for most nuclei, their mass is obtained by summing
the masses of their constituent protons and neutrons (up to a relatively small but very important
binding energy). This implies that apart from identical particles effects, the protons and neutrons
keep their identities inside nuclei. Hence most of the mass that makes our bodies and most of the
matter that we see around us has its origin in a rather deep quantum phenomenon, confinement,
and the breaking of scale invariance. It is remarkable, most of our mass is of quantum origin.
