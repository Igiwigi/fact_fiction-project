more marketable, are--cut off at a-$econd_ heating, and the

I have observed the.;same facts and similar appearances-in
operations of a like nature, and can account satisfactorily for
it as follows.

The first - portions of 'metal, that are' separated/jin experi-
ments of this nature, contain the largest $hare of the whole
carbon introduced into the mixture. It follows of course, that
an inferior degree of heat will maintain this portion. of metal
in a state. of fluidity, but that a much higher temperature is
requisite- to reduce the particles of metal, thus for a season
robbed of their carbon, and bring them into contact with the
portion first rendered fluid, to receive their proportion of the
steely principle. Where the heat is-languid, the descent of the
