Had botanists not got accustomed to the existence of Sawrurus among living plants
it would surely have attracted the anatomistsâ€™ attention, It has no large vessels, no
differentiation of the wood into vessels and fibres. Its metaxylem elements are
exclusively scalariform. No phylogenetic views are here expressed : we wish merely
to note the fact, brought to our notice by the discovery of the fossil Saururopsis,
that the Saururacean anatomy is of an extraordinarily suggestive description. Among the Angiosperms there is but one that seems to belong to the Mono-
cotyledons, the flower Cretovarium. This, curiously enough, is .comparatively
abundant.
