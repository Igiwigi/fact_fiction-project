Thus,
even in the case of two coevolving traits, genetic constraints
owing to the underlying genetic architecture can have strong
effects on long-term evolution and the resulting ESSs. The
study of coevolving traits is nothing new to quantitative gen-
etics [198-200] where the importance of genetic constraints
has long been emphasized. In fact, recent work by Mullon &
Lehmann [197] ties together the quantitative genetic and inva-
sion fitness approaches for coevolving traits. By building from
an invasion fitness perspective that is comfortable with fitness
as a complex function of species ecology and behaviour, this
synthetic approach shows how pleiotropy, demography and
behaviour can interact to shape the coevolution of two syner-
gistic social traits [197]. Many conceptual divides in evolutionary theory have
been bridged in recent decades including divides surround-
ing ESS analysis and its role in genotypic and phenotypic

evolution and in kin and group selection.
