Such an analogy should
rather lead the physiologist to look for some extraneous source of the organizing
force; and to suspect that when organizable materials are applied to the extension of
a living structure, and are caused to manifest vital forces, some agency external to the
organism is the moving spring of the whole series of operations. And thus, according to
the view here advocated, the vital force which causes the primordial cell of the germ
first to multiply itself, and then to develope itself into a complex and extensive organ-
ism, was not either originally locked up in that single cell, nor was it latent in the
materials which are progressively assimilated by itself and its descendants ; but is
directly and immediately supplied by the Heat which is constantly operating upon it,
and which is transformed into vital force by its passage through the organized fabric
that manifests it. The facts already cited, which show how completely dependent the
process of germ-development, both in plants and animals, is upon the constant
agency of heat, and how precisely its rate may be regulated by the measure of that
force supplied to it, appear to the author to be 80 much better accounted for upon
this view than upon either of the others, that he ventures to think that they de-
monstrate it almost as fully as the nature of physiological evidence will admit. Having thus contrasted the doctrine for which he is contending, with those which
are current among physiologists, the author thinks it well to point out that he no
more regards heat as the * vital principle,” or as itself identical with the © vital
force,” than it is identical with electricity or with chemical affinity. Nor does he in
the least recognize the possibility, that any action of heat upon the inorganic ele-
ments can of itself deyelope an organized structure of even the simplest kind.
