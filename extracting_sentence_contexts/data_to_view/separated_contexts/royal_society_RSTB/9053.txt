In recent years, it
became quick and inexpensive to carry out systematic genome-wide genotyping capturing much of the polymorphic content
of a phenotyped sample, allowing researchers to perform hypothesis-free association screening at high density across the
genome. These screens involve an enormous amount of multiple testing (hundreds of thousands of polymorphisms in
each individual), so rigorously adjusted thresholds for statistical significance are required to avoid false positives. Together
with the fact that most complex traits are likely to involve many genes with very small effect sizes, such studies require
sample sizes of thousands of individuals to achieve adequate power. In the post-genomic era, scientists also now make
use of copy number variation (CNV) data and rare variations emerging from next-generation sequencing studies. Again, the
key to success is use of robust statistics and replication in independent samples, to discount spurious genotypeâ€”phenotype
relationships.
