8 (17) and others have shown the strong toxic action of this vapour, and that it
5 particularly attacks protoplasm, producing dark discoloration and death. If a leaf
3 be exposed to mercury vapour, even the deeply situated cells turn dark in a short
4 time. From this ready penetration by a substance that cannot osmose, Mercrr
© argues that the vapour must pass through the stomata and penetrate by the inter-
cellular spaces. Also, if a leaf be injected with mercury and pressed between paper
£& sensitized with AgNOs, the blackening of the paper by the vapour only occurs in
5 those parts which bear stomata. The interpretation given is no doubt correct, but it
£ is not logically conclusive, for the very fact that mercury attacks protoplasm shows
3 that it must osmose through a colloid membrane—the cell wall—and so might enter
3 the leaf partly through the cuticle.* One fact the author does establish, namely,
5 that diffusion takes place through stomata with equal facility in either direction.
