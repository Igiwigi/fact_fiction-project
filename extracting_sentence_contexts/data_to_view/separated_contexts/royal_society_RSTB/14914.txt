Likewise, Lin et al. [122] detected higher
upregulated in phagocytic microglia [134]. In primary micro- EEA1 levels in APOE4 iPSC-derived neurons compared to
glia, this result was replicated at 1h using oligomeric AB42 APOE3. In fact, the pH of the EE is almost equivalent to
[134]. Muth et al. showed, using in vitro murine microglia, the IEP of APOE4, leading to an IEP surface charge reduction
that APOE4 increases apoptotic neuron phagocytosis, but resulting in decreased solubility that slows APOE4 receptor
reduces oligomeric AB phagocytosis after 30 min, compared dissociation and diminishes receptor recycling (figure 2,
to APOE3 (figure 2, parts 6-7) [135]. These confirmed results part 11) [141].
