By symmetry it is only necessary to consider one-eighth of the square; it is also convenient
to take the constant in (B. 6) to be 25,600. The finite-difference equation corresponding to
(B. 5) is then given by

and fictitious points will be eliminated by the use of the formula for r = 6 in table 1. With
an interval h = } the configuration is identical with that of figure 9, and corresponds also
to figure 18 of Fox & Southwell (1941) (in which all the values of w should be multiplied by
the factor 0-4096 to reproduce the exact conditions of the present example).

The main concern at present is to show how accuracy is improved, on a relatively coarse
_ mesh, by the use of more complicated but more accurate finite-difference equations, and it
is therefore undesirable to introduce errors, of the type discussed in §5, due to inadequate
relaxation of the simultaneous equations. For this reason the latter have been solved, in this
example, by means of a reciprocal matrix, similar to that of table 2, but incorporating the
more accurate derivative formulae at the boundary.

The first approximation w® obtained in this way is shown, at internal and fictitious
