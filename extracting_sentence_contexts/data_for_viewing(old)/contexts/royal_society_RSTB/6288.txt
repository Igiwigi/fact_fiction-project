GENETICAL

In September, 1932, seeds were collected of a wild Oenothera on the peninsula
known as Penzance, near Wood’s Hole, Massachusetts, from plants growing by the
roadside. The following year a culture of fifty plants was grown in the experimental
grounds at Regent’s Park. ‘They were quite uniform in character except two plants
to be mentioned later. This species in cultivation has foliage remarkably like that
of the Ocnothera Lamarckiana of bE VRixs’ experiments, but with leaves somewhat
narrower, more pointed, and less crinkled than in that species. The flowers were,
however, small like those of O. biennis. It is proposed to call this species O.
paralamarckiana, not only on account of its resemblance to O. Lamarckiana, but also
because it produces numerous trisomic mutations, in fact, in a much higher propor-
tion than they have ever appeared in O. Lamarckiana itself. A full technical
description of this new species will be published elsewhere. Figs. 1 and 2 are from
photographs of typical plants of the 1933 culture in the rosette and flowering stages
respectively.

The original culture from wild seeds contained one dwarf mutation, unbranched,
with smaller flowers, fig. 3, and another plant with narrower, smooth leaves. There
was also some variation in the amount of red pigment on the midribs of the leaves.
In the light of subsequent knowledge, it is necessary to conclude that the smooth
leaved plant was probably a trisomic mutation. The dwarf might also be expected
to have 15 chromosomes, if not more, since its offspring nearly all had 15. While
dwarfs in Oenothera, such as nanella, have been found to have 14 chromosomes, other
