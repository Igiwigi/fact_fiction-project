Seems to be capable of being permanently restored through
it. Concentrated sulphuric acid, which is a much more perfect
conductor, is equally inefficient, for it has little action upon
zinc, and is itself decomposed only by a very strong power.
Piles, containing as their fluid element either pure water or
sulphuric acid, will undoubtedly give single shocks, and this
effect is connected with the restoration of the equilibrium dis-
turbed by the energies of the metals; but when their extreme
plates are connected there is no exhibition, as in usual cases
of electromotion. Water containing loosely combined oxygene
is more efficient than water containing common air, as it enables

* The experiments proving this fact, and the other analogous facts in this page,

oxide of zinc to be formed more rapidly, and in larger quan-
tities. Neutrosaline solutions which are at first very active,
loose their energy in proportion as their acid arranges itself
on the side of the zinc, and their alkali on that of the copper ;
and I have found the powers of a combination nearly de-
stroyed from this cause very much revived, merely by agi-
