as to include the effects of mutual molecular influences. Such a representation of the
facts has led to the recognition of a large molecular forcive, in all crystalline media,
depending upon the nature and proximity of the molecules in any particular
crystalline grouping. The existence of this intrinsic molecular field can only be
inferred indirectly. Although the actual properties of the crystalline state depend
upon the operation of this field, yet, except in the case of substances of a
ferro-magnetic nature, there is no direct experimental evidence which discloses its
very great magnitude.
