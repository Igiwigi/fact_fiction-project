Gay Lussac and 'THENARD have detailed an extensive series of
facts upon muriatic acid, and oxymuriatic acid. . Some of their
experiments/are similar to those I have detailed inthe paper
just referred to ; others are peculiarly their own,,and of a very
curious kind: their general conclusion is, that muriatic acid gas
contains about one quarter of its, weight of water ; and that
oxymuriatic acid is not decomposable by any substances but
hydrogene, or such as can form triple combinations with it. One of the most singular facts that I have observed. on this
subject, and which I have before referred to, is, that charcoal,
even. when ignited to whiteness in oxymuriatic or muriatic
acid gases, by the VoLTaic battery, effects no change in them ;
if it has been previously freed from hydrogene and moisture
by intense ignition in vacuo.
