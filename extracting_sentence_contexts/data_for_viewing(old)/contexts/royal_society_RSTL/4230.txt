II. On the Chemical Nature of a Wax from China.

THE wax which is the subject of the following investigation, is a substance which
was imported into this country from China as an article of commerce. Its appearance
closely resembles that of spermaceti. It is, like spermaceti, white and, in large
masses, highly crystalline, but differs from it by being harder, more brittle, and of a
more fibrous character of crystallization, The melting-point of the wax is about
83? C. It is but very slightly soluble in either alcohol or ether, but dissolves with
great facility in naphtha, out of which fluid it may be crystallized. This substance
is generally spoken of as a vegetable wax: on looking however into such facts as I
can gather which throw any light on its origin, it seems more than probable that,
like bees'-wax, it is the secretion of an insect. Sir GzorGt STAUNTON, in his © Em-
bassy to China*,” gives an account of a wax of insect origin, which there formed an
article of trade, and in his work may be seen a drawing of the insect and of the tree
on which the insect lives. Other writers on China give a similar account. In the
Comptes Rendus for 1840+ is a paper by M. SranisLas JuLien, who gives an account
of this tree wax, and states it to be the work of an insect : where may be found also
a great number of extracts from Chinese writers on agriculture, giving an account
of the insect itself and of the trees suitable for its food ; one of these trees is the
Rhus s$uccedaneum. This same gentleman, M. STaxisLas JuLteN, gave to M. Lewy,
who was engaged in an invyestigation on these wax substances, a specimen of the wax
from this very plant, which is therefore in all probability this insect-wax. The melt-
