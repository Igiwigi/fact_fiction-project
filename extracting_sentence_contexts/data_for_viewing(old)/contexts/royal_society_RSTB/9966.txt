regime, importance of material wealth)? Does status compe-
tition in real-world systems exhibit the kind of cyclical
dynamics exhibited by the model, as illustrated in figure 3? If
so, on what time scales do they occur, and to what extent is
variation across time and space a result of endogenous
dynamics versus variation in socio-ecological parameters?
We hope that the current formalization will stimulate
the empirical work necessary to evaluate whether status
competition plays the role hypothesized here.

Additionally, while we have framed the model in terms of
capital stocks whose effects are purely rank-independent or
purely rank-dependent, these stocks in fact arise from bun-
dles or portfolios of goods with a mix of rank-independent
and rank-dependent effects. An important empirical goal is
thus to quantify the direct and indirect effects of different
goods on health, economic productivity, and social status,
and the relationship between these intermediate factors and
outcomes of survival and reproduction. These data would
allow the development of more precise models with greater
relevance to particular times and places.

Empirical work focusing on the relationships between
social inequality and fertility is still nascent. Our findings are
consistent with the work of Kremer & Chen [84], who found
