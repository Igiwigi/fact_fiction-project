The geological aspect of the question was placed in the hands of
Dr, Ausrey Strawn, Director of the Geological Survey, who obtained the sanction
of H.M. Treasury for the employment of Dr. A. H. Cox as a temporary member of
the staff of the Geological Survey in order that he might carry out the geological
part of the work. The work of determining the magnetic susceptibilities of the
various rocks collected was undertaken by Prof. Ernest Wuson, of University of
London, King’s College. The geological examination of the district was greatly facilitated by the fact that
the whole area had recently been re-surveyed by the officers of H.M. Geological
Survey, and the results of their investigations shown on the Geological Maps and
Memoirs (list on p. 94). It was thought desirable that a series of observations should also be made on some
known sheet of iron-ore with a view to determining the character of the disturbances
caused by the sheet. The district selected on the advice of Prof, H. Louis, the
Chairman of the Committee, was near Irthlingborough in Northamptonshire.
