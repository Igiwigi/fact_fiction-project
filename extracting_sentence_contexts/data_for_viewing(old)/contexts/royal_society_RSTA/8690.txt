weight ‘the dispersion becomes normal in so far as the angle of rotation
increases continuously with the refrangibility of the light; yet the rotation
increases so little from the ray F to the ray e, that one cannot doubt that it
would have a maximum in the violet part of the spectrum” (‘ Ann. Chim.
Phys.,’ 1858, vol. 54, p. 412). Our observations prove the reality of this
hypothetical maximum, whilst, at the same time, they show the futility of any
definition of “ normal dispersion’ which depends merely on the removal of
the maximum from the easily-visible into the violet or ultra-violet region of
the spectrum; a similar usage of this term by WryrHer has already been
criticised (Lowry, * Trans. Chem, Soc.,’ 1915, vol. 107, p. 1195) on the ground
that it implies a physiological definition of a purely physical property. Anoma-
lous dispersion depending on the imperfect compensation of two simple rotatory
dispersions of opposite sign may, as a matter of actual fact, be rendered normal
by displacing the maximum to infinite wave-length in the infra-red ; but any
displacement in the opposite direction only exaggerates the invisible maximum
in the ultra-violet region.*

7. TARTRATES OF THE ALKALI-METALS.

In his sealed note, communicated to the Academy on August 25, 1834, Bror referred
for the first time to the rotatory power of the tartrates in the following terms :—‘‘ The
combinations of tartaric acid with solid bases give products endowed with rotation
towards the right ; but the relative intensity of thesé rotations for the different simple
rays obeys the general law of this phenomenon, to which tartaric acid alone is a marked
exception, at least, among all the bodies which I have been able to study hitherto ”
