The movements of the septum were carefully followed with a view to determining the
true function of this organ, which has been a matter of dispute. Tn the Septibranchs, unlike the other Lamellibranchs, there is no continuous current
of water passing in through the inhalant, and out by way of the exhalant, siphon, even
when these are fully extended and obviously functioning. Instead, there is an occasional
widening of the opening of the inhalant siphon followed by a sudden intake of water, while
at the same time the exhalant siphon opens to its fullest extent, water being expelled
through the opening with considerable force, a fact which can be clearly demonstrated
