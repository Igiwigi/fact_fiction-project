Therefore, as was noted by
Bertoldi & Sglavo [42], although the angle is not severely affected by the indenter geometry, it is
very sensitive to the glass composition and especially to Poisson’s ratio. Note that the effect of v
on a was already mentioned by Lawn et al. [55] who noted that v has a profound influence on the
stress field and further attempted to ‘tune’ the v value to get their modelling to match better with
the experimental results for a. There is strong evidence for the fact that in glasses susceptible to experience a density increase
(be it due to a high pressure treatment or to a local indentation), densification is assisted by the
presence of a concomitant shear stress component [66,67]. It turns out that the profiles for the
shear isocontours change much with v, and that the overall region associated with a shear stress
larger than a given value extends with v, especially along the xy-plane (surface). The maximum
shear stress (equation (3.11)) is represented for three different glasses in figure 15 (second row).
