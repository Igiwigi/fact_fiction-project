Moreover, the difference between the first denominator and the corresponding one for
D”” is 2924, and this is 17A,. Tt is of course understood that the digits “11 in the
limit have been chosen so that the 17A,, 6A,, come very close. The argument
depends on the possibility of doing this. In fact Ryppere’s tables give the limit
22926, so that the modification by ‘11 is extremely slight. Thus the observed line is
the line corresponding to m = 5 of this series, and it probably hides the weaker line
of D’(8). This accounts for the deviation noted above between calculated and
observed in D” (8). Ihave no explanation to offer for the corresponding deviation
form =7. All the others come so close that it is difficult to imagine that this does
not fall in with the rule. It is equivalent to an error in \ of about 1°2 A.U. The
doublet separation for D” is ‘62 very closely, and the corresponding doublet difference
is 153, = Asay. A lateral displacement of 7A on the limit would just make the
change, but that explanation seems out of place here. The separations 7°83, 12°43
of the new lines require denominator differences in the limit of 373 and 473, and
4A, = 380 and 5A, = 475. There is another line at 6267'06, showing a separation of
5'81(°3). If this has the same VD as 6261 it requires a denominator difference in
