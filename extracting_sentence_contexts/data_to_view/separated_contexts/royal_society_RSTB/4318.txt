A further reference
to the illustrations will show that the specimens found at Knowle Farm Pit,
Savernake (Plate 51, figs. 1-4, and Plate 52, figs. 1-4), at Warren Hill (Plate 54,
figs. 1-4) and in the Thames Valley (Plate 53, figs. 1-4 and Plate 55, figs. 1-4) are all
furnished with a more or less flat ventral surface, and that each of them, especially
towards the anterior region, are approximately triangular in section. The implements,
on the other hand, found at Ipswich (Plate 56, figs. 1-4), and at Axminster (Plate 57,
figs. 1-4), do not exhibit the flat ventral surface. In fact this surface has been
replaced by a ventral ridge and the section of the implements has become roughly
rhomboidal. In 1911 Sir Ray Lanxesrer described before the Royal Society the series of
flint implements found beneath the Pliocene Red Crag of Suffolk, to which he gave
the name of “rostro-carinate.” Of these particular specimens he states* : “In the
Pre-Crag implements the anterior narrow edge, though tending to the vertical, is
strongly curved and gives the implement the form of the beak of an accipitrine bird. The form of this region of the implement may also be compared to that of the prow
of a boat (the boat being turned keel upwards).
