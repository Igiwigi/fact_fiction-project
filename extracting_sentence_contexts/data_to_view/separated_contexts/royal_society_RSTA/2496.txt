the
largest values of a, and a, are associated with the years of sunspot minimum, but the
smallest values occur in 1897, an intermediate year as regards sunspots. Accident
seems to play a sensible part in the relation between phase angles in successive years,
especially in the case of a; and «, The same remark applies in even greater measure
to Table XX. Tn fact the influence of sunspot frequency on the phase is so small that for its study
it is desirable to combine the years in groups representative respectively of large and
small sunspot frequency, in hopes of eliminating accidental features. ;
