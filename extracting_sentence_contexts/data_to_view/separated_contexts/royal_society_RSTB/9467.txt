homologous gene ina sister lineage is the first piece of evidence

interested in detecting cases where the gene is absent because it
evolved after the lineage divergence. However, we must also w
contemplate and eliminate the alternative possibilities that  °
the absence is due to recent gene loss in the sister lineage, or <S
that the absence is false and is in fact an annotation omission  &
or genome sequencing gap. For these reasons, the most rigor- = ©
ous (and conservative) methods to detect de novo genes
require positive evidence of the absence of the gene in the
other lineages (such as the identification of orthologous but
non-coding sequence), thus permitting inference of absence
in the ancestral sequence [26,42]. Ideally, these studies should
include transcriptome data analysis to accompany DNA
sequence analysis to minimize the under-discovery of genes.
