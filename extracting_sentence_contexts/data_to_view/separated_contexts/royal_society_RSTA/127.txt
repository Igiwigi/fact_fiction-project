Therefore, patterns
obtained by a GSPT construction are structurally stable. This is particularly important for the
connection with biological practice. The fact that mathematical models are, by nature, a strongly
reduced idealization of biological reality, is often a major point of criticism from biologists, who
object that the omission of several biologically observed processes that are thought to play a
minor role, makes the resulting model less reliable. The geometrical construction provided by
GSPT shows that, as long as the resulting response curves do not fundamentally change when
these minor processes are included, the mathematical statements regarding patterns remain valid
for the extended model. We emphasize that the number of model variables plays an important
role in structural stability: extending or reducing the model by including or removing variables
can have a profound effect on the mathematical results of existence and stability.
