W. THOMSON ON THE MATHEMATICAL THEORY OF MAGNETISM. being s0lenoidal which it presents ; while the formulze of Q 76. merely expresses a fact
with reference to lamellar distributions, and being only applicable to lamellar distribu-
tions, do not indicate the effect of a deviation from being lamellar, in a distribution
of a general form. Certain considerations regarding the comparison between common
magnets and electro-magnets, suggested by Amezre's theorem that the magnetic
action of a closed galyanic circuit is the same as that of a © magnetic shell” (as de-
fined in $ 67.) of any form having its edge coincident with the circuit, led me to a
synthetical investigation of a distribation of galvanism through the interior and at
the surface of a magnet, magnetized in any arbitrary manner, from which I deduced
formulz, for the resultant force at any external or internal point, giving the desired
indication regarding effect of a deviation from being lamellar, on expressions which,
for Jamellar distributions, depend solely on the tangential component of magnetiza-
tion at points infinitely near the surface. These galvanic elements throughout the
body, from the action of which the resultant force at any external point is com-
pounded, produce effects which are not separately expressible by means of a poten-
tial, and therefore, although of course when the three components X, Y, Z of the total
resultant force at any point (x, y, 2) have been obtained, they will be found to be
such that Xde+Ydy+Zdz is a complete differential, the separate infinitely small ele-
ments of which these forces are compounded by integration with reference to the
elements of the magnet, do not separately satisfy such a condition.
