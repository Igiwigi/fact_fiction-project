Not improbably the want of homogeneousness in the earlier
data, already referred to, may be partly accountable for the apparent change. At all
events, the results for the final period, 1889-96, show no distinct progressive
diminution of @ or increase of b as compared to the period 1865-96. In fact, the
“all” day data for these two periods, and the “quiet” day data for the shorter
period, give almost identical values for the mean b for the year. As regards the seasonal phenomena, each set of Greenwich data makes b con-
spicuously least, but b/a conspicuously largest, in “ winter.” The December value of
b is invariably the smallest. The “all” and “quiet” day data for 1889-96, as
already stated, give very nearly the same mean value of b for the year, but the
“quiet” days’ value for b is much the larger of the two in winter, and the smaller in
summer.
