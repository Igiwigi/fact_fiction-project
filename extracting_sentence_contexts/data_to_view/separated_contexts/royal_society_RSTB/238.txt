The move--
ment in the first case was that of extension of the second and third toes, in the other
it was that of opposition. Of course, in the Monkey, the second toe is the homo- |
logue of the index finger, and consequently is occasionally associated in movement
with the hallux, as a primary movement ; thus, at centres 65 and 68 in Monkeys 25
and 40 respectively, separation of these two digits was observed in the former,
followed by extension of all the toes, while in the latter opposition took place. The
march of the movements at these centres makes it quite clear that in these instances
the second and third toes occupy undoubtedly a truly primary position, since move-
ment of these is followed by that of all the other toes.

(4) Purposive Movements.

(a.) Head and Eyes.â€”It is well worth while to shortly review the so-called
voluntary or purposive movements in the light of the facts detailed in the foregoing
pages. In the first place, rotation of the head and eyes to one side is a necessary
accompaniment of all the highest movements. This will probably explain the fact
that this rotation of the head and eyes is represented over the whole breadth of the
hemisphere reaching from near to the fissure of Sytvrus below to the middle line
above.
