involves functional materials and active control. The latter always includes three important
elements, i.e. actuators, sensors and processors. New exciting applications in this area span
from large civil structures for deployment against seismic load and aircraft wings that exhibit
morphing properties through space deployable antennas and various micro-electromechanical
systems. Understanding the detailed dynamics and precise functionalities of complex adaptive
structures poses many challenges to designers. This is mainly due to the fact that functional
materials and hybrid-based mechatronic designs used in adaptive structures are often associated
with non-stationarity, nonlinearity and ambiguity with respect to vibration analysis and dynamic
testing.

The classical approaches used for vibration and identification of linear time-invariant
(LTI) systems are well established and use various parametric/non-parametric and input-
output/output-only methods. The well-known frequency response function (FRF) is one of the

most widely used non-parametric input-output approaches. The analysis and identification of : =
time-variant systems requires different methods. : a

The parametric methods for time-variant systems are based on parametric models that are 3
