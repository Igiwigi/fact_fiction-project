Bones of animals under circumstances s0 similar, although in
different parts of the globe, one would have naturally supposed

one principle acting in all places. In Gibraltar they are mostly
of the ruminating tribe, of the hare kind, and the bones of birds ;
yet there are some of a small dog or fox, and likewise shells.
Those in Dalmatia appear to be mostly of the ruminating
tribe, yet I saw a part of the os hyoides of a horse ; but those
from Germany are mostly carnivorous. From these facts |
we $should be inclined to suppose, that their accumulation did
not arise from any instinctive mode of living, as the same
mode could not suit both carnivorous and herbivorous animals.

In considering animals respecting their situation upon the
globe, there are many which are peculiar to particular climates,
and others that are less confined, as herrings, mackerel, and
salmon ; others again, which probably move over the whole
extent of the sea, as the shark, porpus, and whale tribe ; while
many shell-fish must be confined to one spot. If the sea had
not shifted its situation more than once, and was to leave the
land in a very short time, then we could determine what the
