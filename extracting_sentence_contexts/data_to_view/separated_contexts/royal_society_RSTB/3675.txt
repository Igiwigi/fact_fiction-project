The following table gives the results of
two sets of experiments :—

Taste V.—Effect of Intensity of Stimulus on Velocity in Sub-tonic Specimens. Number. | Stimulus. Velocity. |
Mestesed it edd aces sere
| 1 0:5 10:0 |
| 4-0 13°3 |
| 2 0°5 5:9 |
2°5 8:3

The fact that stimulus itself may enhance conductivity in a sub-tonic tissue may
be seen in a striking manner in specimens of Mimosa which are in sluggish
