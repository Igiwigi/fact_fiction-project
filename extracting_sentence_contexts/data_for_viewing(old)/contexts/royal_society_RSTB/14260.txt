touch that is light and feathery, like a spider crawling upon one’s skin
(termed knismesis), the other touch that is heavy and rhythmic, and commonly
associated with playful and interactive behaviour (termed gargalesis; [1]).
While knismesis is readily elicited on any part of the body, and may be self-
evoked, gargalesis is invariably more intricate. It occurs only in response to
touch at certain parts of the body, is dependent on mood and context and gen-

provokes laughter, placing it in a unique position of the behavioural repertoire.

Efforts to categorize ticklish responses were undertaken by Hall and Allin,
who conducted a vast survey on ticklishness in children, albeit without consid-
ering the distinction of gargalesis and knismesis they went on to coin [1]. They
