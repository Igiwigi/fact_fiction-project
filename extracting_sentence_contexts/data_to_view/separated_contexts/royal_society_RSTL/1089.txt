Potash
has no affinity for arsenic, yet from the experiments of these gentlemen, it appears
that potassium separates ars2nic from arseniated hydrogene ; and hydrogene, which is
supposed by them to exist in both compounds, can have no affinity for hydrogene,
nor can hydrogene in one form, be suppozzd capable of separating arsenic from hydro-
gene in another form,

Could not the experiment of M. M. Gay Lussac and! Tahexarp be explained,
except on the $upposition of the hydrogene being derived from the potassium, it would
be a distinct fact in favour of the revival of the theory of phlogiston. It would not
prove, however, that potas;ium is composed of hydrogene and potash, but that it is
compozed of hydrogene and an unknown basis ; and that potash is this basis united
to water,


368 Mr. Davy's Electrochemical Researches on

Other hypotheses might be formed upon the new electro-
chemical facts, in which still fewer elements than those allowed
in the antiphlogistic or phlogistic theory might be maintained. Certain electrical states always coincide with certain chemical
states of bodies. Thus acids are uniformly negative, alkalies
positive, and inflammable- $i b;tances highly positive ; and as I
have found, acid matters when positively electrified, and alka-
line matters when negatively electrified, seem to loose all their
peculiar properties and powers of combination.
