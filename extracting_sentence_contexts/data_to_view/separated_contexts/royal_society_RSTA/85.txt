We refer to [8] and the references therein for a recent survey on some of the most relevant
mathematical aspects on this approach to swarm models. Nevertheless, the proper definition of a
limit dynamics when an external control is added to the system, and it is supposed to have some
sparsity surprisingly remains a difficult task. In fact, the most immediate and perhaps natural
approach would be to assign as well to the finite-dimensional control u an atomic vector-valued
time-dependent measure

N
vy () = > Uj8(x,(t),v(t)

i=l
and consider a proper limit v for N + +00, leading to the controlled PDE
+0 View = Vy - (A * we + vd, (1.4)

where now v represents an external source field. Unfortunately, despite the fact that vy are
supposed to be the minimizers of certain cost functionals which may allow for the necessary
compactness to derive the limit vy â€” v, it seems eventually hard to design a cost functional
with a proper meaning in the finite-dimensional model and at the same time promoting a good
behaviour of the measure v. In fact, for the optimal control problems considered for instance
in [6, section 5], such a limit procedure does not prevent v being singular with respect to jp.
