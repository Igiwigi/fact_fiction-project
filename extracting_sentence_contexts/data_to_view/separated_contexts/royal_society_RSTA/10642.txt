H. DARWIN ON ELLIPSOIDAL HARMONIC ANALYSIS. In fact, whilst we have as before, when 7 and s are both odd or both even,

ay Py
Ui-. —8+ Bo’
we also have
ine +h. sop 1
Bo Gi (4 2 — s? spr Lala fii + 9) (2s)
and similarly a fraction for aus * and so forth. It follows therefore that while the q’s with suffixes less than or equal to 7 depend
on finite continued fractions, those with suffixes greater than 7 depend on infinite
continued fractions. Tt thus appears that while the first series in the expression for Q/ or for Q; has
limits 1 to $s or } (s — 1), as before, the limits of the second series are 1 to «.
