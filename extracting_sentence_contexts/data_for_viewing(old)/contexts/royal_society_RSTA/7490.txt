liquids appear to dissipate locally a portion equal to TAS and store a portion equal to AA
which is again finally dissipated by moving towards energy sinks. It seems that to a first
approximation this sharing of energy between recoverable and irrecoverable portions is
a temperature function only, but other experience with the systems makes us believe that it
is also influenced by the state and rate of shear.

(iii) Viscosity

The most significant implications of these findings are in the domain of viscosity and
viscometry. These findings render the conventional terminology and concepts inapplicable
to these systems. Thus, in experiments in which shearing is rapid and intense a yield value is
obtained. However, when the liquids are left to stand they will always reveal a flat mirror
surface denoting absence of yield values. It is this fact that modified the conclusion drawn
in the section on shear elasticity to the effect that besides the temperature the rate of shearing
influences the partition of the energy input into shear elastic, recoverable portion and an
irrecoverable portion. Whilst a model of elastic and viscous elements in series would represent
this behaviour mathematically (a model of spring with variable elasticity and a non-New-
tonian liquid dash-pot in parallel is really necessary to represent it) it is felt that the use of
such models should be purely for calculation purposes ; the systems are not made up of several
elements in series or parallel, but they undergo several processes in parallel.

In viscometry, viscosity is defined as the ratio of F to é, the shearing stress to the rate of
shear acting at a small element of area. In practice, however, it is almost impossible to
obtain a system in which ¢ is uniform throughout the liquid. Hence, according to these
findings, there is rarely a case of simple shear; secondary flow down the space gradients of
