in diameter, and 100 nm LDCVs, in addition to a plethora of


polymorphous membranous compartments that can be var-
iously described as vesicles, tubules and cisterns. Our confocal
images showed that the organelles that contained VMAT2,
VGAT or varying amounts of both transporters exhibited appar-
ent sizes of 0.3â€”-1.4 ym and, therefore, probably corresponded
to the granules and LDCVs present in the electron micrographs.
It must be emphasized, however, that our identification of
the immunoreactive organelles was biased towards structures
larger than a single pixel. Indeed, the broad spectrum of sizes
of the transmitter quanta and the fact that both their GABAergic
and dopaminergic populations were skewed towards smaller
events indicate that the secretory organelles were highly
heterogeneous and had to include a proportion of the small
membranous profiles visible with the electron microscope.

There is also evidence that synaptic vesicles in DA cells may
contain both dopamine and GABA: as noted above, confocal
microscopy had shown co-localization of VMAT2, VGAT and
GABA in the axonal varicosities of DA cells [22], and we
observed in electron micrographs of retinal cryosections that
both synaptic vesicles and LDCVs were apparently labelled
by antibodies to both transporters.
