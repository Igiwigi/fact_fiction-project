plunger P'; and the change of capacity of the reseryoir due to one revolution of this
screw requires to be accurately ascertained.

A little above }/ there are two side tubes, terminating in bulbs 6, #4, which are
attached at an angle to the tube T.

One of these bulbs contains a desiccating substance, such as sulphuric acid, baryta, or
anhydrous phosphoric acid, while the other contains a little caustic potash, a substance
which has a strong attraction for carbonic acid.

Let us begin by supposing these two bulbs to be attached to the tube T, as in fig. 1,
and let us also suppose that they are open to the atmosphere at their extremities.
Suppose in fact that the tube T with its appendages has just been screwed on to the
reseryoir R, Now by means of the screw $S drive the mercury up T until it reaches
the level // a little below the opening where the side tubes branch off; and when it has
reached this level, seal off the extremities of the two bulbs. All communication between
the air in the bulbs and the atmosphere is thus intercepted.

The bulb B must now be heated as often as possible, and each time a portion of its
air will be driven into the bulbs 6, 3, and there deprived of moisture and carbonic acid.
The tube # should also be heated occasionally, and also the tube T above 4, including
the appendage tubes, but not the bulbs, the object being to drive away any moisture
which may cling to the glass; but at the same time care must be taken not, to heat the
mercury, in case by any possibility some of its vapour may enter into the bulb B.
