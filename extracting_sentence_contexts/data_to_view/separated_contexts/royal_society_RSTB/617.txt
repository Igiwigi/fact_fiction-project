This experi-
ment shows clearly that the sensitive impressions coming from the right posterior
limb, after the first section, passed across the spinal cord from the right into the left
side, along which they were transmitted to the encephalon. â€œ (3) To obtain a very striking result from the experiment which consists in only one
section of a lateral half of the spinal cord, it is better to make it after the posterior
columns have been divided. We know that after this there is hyperssthesia in the
parts of the body which are behind the section; if, after having ascertained this fact,
the section of a lateral half is completed when the posterior columns have been
divided, we find that the hyperzsthesia seems to increase on the side of the second
operation, while on the opposite side, not only the hyperssthesia, but sensibility
entirely disappears. (4) The spinal cord is laid bare in the lumbar region, and a careful division of the
entire extent of the part of the organ giving origin to the nerves of the posterior
limbs is made so as to separate the two lateral halves of the organ, one from the other. The result is: Voluntary movements still exist in the posterior limbs (though
diminished on account of the injury to the muscles of the lumbar region), but sensi-
bility is entirely lost in them.
