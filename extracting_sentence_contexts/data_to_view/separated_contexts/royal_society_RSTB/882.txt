I cannot be certain as to th
point of attachment of these processes, but it seems to have been near the hinder en
of each vertebra. The diminution in size of the posterior vertebra and the presene
of these transverse processes leads to the inference that they belong to the caud
region, and that somewhere in front of them the pelvic girdle would be found. As
matter of fact portions of bones have been uncovered in this region, but, unfortunately
nothing that can be definitely assigned to any part of the pelvis or limbs. These caudal vertebree are of Lacertilian type, and the question naturally arises, ca
they be referred to either of the skeletons above described, or to any of the form
known to occur in the Elgin Sandstone of other localities. They are too small for an
known example of Hyperodapedon and much too large for Telerpeton, but woule
agree in size with some of the specimens here included in the genus Gordonia, and
might have belonged to such a form as G. Duffiana.
