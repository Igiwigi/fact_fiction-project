know that the curve passes through the point p = 1-525, v = 0-564. The curve also
passes through the point w= 7/\/3, v=4n. Also, when ¢= », 8 (0, Y) = 1 and

at the origin is + *, and the curve is as drawn in fig. 9. This immediately verifies the
fact that when » = 0 and v = 0, the shape of the stream lines are those given by VON
KArmMAN. When 2-229 > u > x/4/3, wu (0, — cc) is never zero and the stream lines
are either of type 4 (6) or 4 (g), with the type 6 (c) in the transition stage (see fig. 6).
The curve giving the intermediate type is the curve S(X, }#)=1. This curve, which
passes through the points w = x/:/3, v = 4x, and p = 2-229, v = 0, has been drawn
in fig. 9. When » = 2-229, the curves are always of the type 4 (/).
