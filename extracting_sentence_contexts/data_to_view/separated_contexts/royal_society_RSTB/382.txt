The late

Mr. Epwarp Newman describes a most interesting point in this method of conceal-
ment which is often (although I believe not always) adopted. He says (‘ British
Butterflies,’ 1871, p. 63): “ When full-fed it constructs a somewhat more elaborate
retreat ; it gnaws through the petiole of a leaf, or eats the main stalk of the nettle
within a few inches of the top, not quite separating it ; the part thus almost separated
falls over and completely withers, and this withered portion is formed into a compact
retreat ; from the roof of this the caterpillar suspends itself by the anal claspers, and
in two days becomes a chrysalis.” This is an exceedingly interesting fact : the pupa
has no green form, but the larva arranges matters so that the dark pupa shall not be
surrounded by living green, but by dark withered leaves, and even when it does not
gain this additional colour-relation it is well concealed in the tent which the larva
has made. But V. atalanta very commonly pupates on mineral surroundings after
