In the outer blocks in the xj;-coordinates, Ey, =D 1, E22 =D22 and E33 =D33, and the true : eae
stress rates coincide with the Janmann rates such that 3} = 20, etc. The incremental strain-stress : &
relationship can be expressed in terms of the applied maximum principal stress rate, Sy, and the : ~
specified T- and L-values using (2.7). The corresponding displacement field in the upper block 7
outside the band reads iy

uy =(Aq—1)xr + Ai, W2=(A2—1)x2 + An, U3 = (A3 — 1x3, (2.8) : 8
and in the lower block outside the band
uy =(Ay —1)x1— Ai, 2 =(A2 — 1)x2 — An, 3 = (Ag — 1x3. (2.9)

The additional rigid body displacements of the outer blocks relative to one another (2A; and
2A2) reflect the fact that band is weaker than the outer blocks and undergoes different strains. By
symmetry, there is no relative displacement of the outer blocks in the x3-direction. The additional
displacements A; and A» would vanish if the band contained no voids.

In setting the boundary conditions for one of the periodic unit cells within the band, it is
assumed that the initially planar interfaces between the band and the outer blocks remain planar
and parallel as deformation proceeds. In reality, the planar periodic array of voids within the
band slightly perturbs the cell/block interface with the same periodicity. This effect, however, is
considered to be very small and neglected in the present model. The displacement rates at the top
and bottom faces of the band read

Uy =Aqxy t Ay, Up =doxg + An, Uz =Agx3. (2.10)
