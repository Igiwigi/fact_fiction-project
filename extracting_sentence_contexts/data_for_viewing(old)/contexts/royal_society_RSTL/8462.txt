570 REPORT ON THE EXPLORATION OF BRIXHAM CAVE.

strongest manner inquiries into its correctness and value, which we ourselves had
been contemplating, but which might have been till longer postponed but for the c
borative testimony afforded by Brixham Caye. Late as we are therefore in bringi
forward the whole of the evidence afforded by this cave, it must not be overlooked th
however interesting the full record may prove, the exploration has already had an im
diate and direct value in the successful impulse which it gave to 80 important a ques
as that of the antiquity of man. Well established as this fact now is from other
independent grounds, nevertheless the evidence of Brixham has its own special points
value,—in the completeness of its record, in the certainty of its data, and in the fact
its having been the first entire ossiferous cavern which was worked out in a systemai
and complete manner, and the contents preserved for scientific use and reference*®,
records also a time in geological science of very great importance, one marked by
removal of the boundary which had hitherto divided man from the extinct animal
barrier no s00ner removed than the search, before directed timidly to the measurement
of man's age by the span of historical and traditional periods, became now boldly direct
back into the later geological periods in search of his firs: appearance. But, notwiths
standing the range of our new vista, we should not 80 much speculate on its indefinite
extension, but rather seek to obtain those indisputable data, whether as regards the
true position of the strata in which snch remains may be found, or as regards the arti»
ficial character of those remains, without which we might have continued yet to hesitate
to admit man's existence in the Quaternary period.
