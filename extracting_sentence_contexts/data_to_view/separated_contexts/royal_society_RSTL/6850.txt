Its proximity to the pile, and the fact of its "FIG bes cross but one plate of alt.
makes the action of the second chamber much greater than that of the first. Each of the Tables exhibits the fact that as the length of the chamber increases the
dynamic radiation of the gas contained in it increases, and as the length diminishes the
radiation diminishes. We also see how powerfully the gas in the second chamber
acts upon the radiation from the first. With carbonic oxide, the presence of the gas in
the second chamber reduces the deflection from 13%7 to 6*3; with carbonic acid it is
reduced from 16:8 to 6:6 ; with nitrous oxide it is reduced from 19:5 to 6:2, Now this
residual deflection, 62, is not entirely due to the transparency of the gas, to heat emitted
by the gas.
