The last-formed floor of dissepiments is always some distance below the septal edges. Usually some five or six septal growth-segments are present between the dissepiments
and the growing edges of the primary septa. This fact allows lateral thickening of
the septal growth-segments to go on during the interval which elapses between their
first laying down at the septal edge and the ultimate withdrawal of the body-wall of
the polyp. Complete withdrawal of the body-wall from any particular tier of
trabecular parts in a septum is of course marked by the formation of a dissepimental
floor at the horizon just above it. One reason why the primary and secondary (sometimes also the next cycles in large
ealyces) septa are usually much thicker than the septa of intermediate cycles is
because they extend to a greater height above the dissepimental floor.
