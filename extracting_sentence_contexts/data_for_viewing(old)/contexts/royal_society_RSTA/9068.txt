The first step was to decompose an operator of given order into the sum of a number
of operators in correspondence with every partition of the number which defines the
order. Since there is a Hammond operator corresponding to every positive integer,
this process resulted in there being an operator in correspondence with every partition
of every integer. The outcome of this decomposition was that the operators were
able to deal with the symmetric operands in a much more effective manner. The
surface material of the mine could not only be removed, but the strata to a considerable
depth could be dealt with. But this was not sufficient. It became necessary to effect
a further decomposition by showing that every partition operator could be represented
by a sum of composition operators. There emerged a composition operator in
correspondence with every permutation of the parts of the partition of the operator.
The operators at, once became effective in dealing with the material in the lower strata
of the mine field. The operators had, in fact, been handled with particular reference
to the operands with which they were to be associated. It was now necessary to
deal with the material of the mine with particular reference to the tools which had

appropriate operators until a numerical result is reached. In order to accomplish this
with facility and to establish laws we have to put the generating functions in such a
