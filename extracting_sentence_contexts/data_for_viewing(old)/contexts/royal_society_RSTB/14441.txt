imagine—and the conclusions they draw from these counterfactuals.

Counterfactuals are mental simulations of ‘what might have been’—imagined
alternatives to past outcomes that might have occurred if circumstances had been
different [3,4]. Counterfactuals often support causal inferences, particularly when
the counterfactual takes the form of an ‘if-then’ conditional [5]. Psychologically,
counterfactual thoughts are consequential in that they help individuals to learn
from mistakes and to plan for the future [6,7]. Politically, they allow societies to
judge the effectiveness of past actions, assign praise or blame to leaders, and
determine how much to support various policies (e.g. [8]).
