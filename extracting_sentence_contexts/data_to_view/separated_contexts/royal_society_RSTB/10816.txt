In diatoms, the metabolic pathways from trioses to the macro-
molecules forming new cells differ from the green algal
lineage due to a different compartmentalization of enzymes
and to peculiar mechanisms of regulation. Owing to the
silica shell, the cell wall has only a minor demand in carbo-
hydrates with the consequence that the diatom biomass is
enriched in lipids and proteins compared with other algal
taxa. All together these facts result in a different C-allocation
regulation in diatoms, whose mechanisms are not yet under-
stood. Recent advances in transgenic cell lines and the
discovery of aureochromes as genetic and metabolic regula-
tors open the future perspective to understand the
regulatory network in more detail. This progress would
help to generate diatom cells engineered for bio-production
