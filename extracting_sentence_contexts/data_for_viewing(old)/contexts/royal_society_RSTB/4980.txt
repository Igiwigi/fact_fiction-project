moves forward, upward and outward; its relationship to the vertebral column
gives the data for determining the respiratory phase in which the ribs were held
while the skiagraph was being taken. A line drawn transversely across the plate
at the lower border of the ventral end of the fifth right rib gives a “subcostal”
plane. In the “whites” this plane is situated 15:7 mm. below the tenth-rib vertebral
level (see figure); in the “natives” it is 19 mm. below this level. Thus, contrary to
what one anticipated, the ribs of the whites are held at a higher respiratory (inspiratory)

level in the “ whites” than in the “ natives” of the high plateau. The true explanation
of this fact will likely be found in the relatively greater antero-posterior diameter of
the thorax of the natives.

It will be noted (see the figure), that the diaphragm holds the same relationship
to the subcostal plane in both “whites” and “natives”; the lower position of the
diaphragm in natives is due to the greater absolute slope of the ribs in them.
Dr. Redfield has measured the slope of the dorsal segment of the eighth rib, and
shows definitely that this segment of the eighth rib is more horizontal—has less
slope—in the “natives” than in the “whites.” The mean angle which the dorsal
segment of the eighth rib makes with the horizontal is 16°2° in ‘“ whites” and
12°8° in “natives.” The slope of the dorsal segment of a rib is not an index to
the axis of movement of a costal arch, nor to the degree of slope of the arch;
the axis on which ribs move is largely determined by the spinal and other muscu-
