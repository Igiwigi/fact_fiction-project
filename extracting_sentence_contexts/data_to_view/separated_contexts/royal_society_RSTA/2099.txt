Postulate I, Quantum Mechanics, implies, in particular, that evolution of states (4.1) is unitary. Its infinitesimal generator takes the form

H=Hpn + Heny + Hr, (4.3)

where Hyp, and Heny act on the BH and environment subsystems, respectively, and H] acts on both,
and can transfer information between them. In fact, LQFT evolution, on a time slicing, can be put
in this form [34]. However, LQFT evolution will not be unitary once the shrinkage of the BH is
taken into account, as we have argued above. In LOFT, H only increases entanglement between
BH and the environment, either by creating Hawking pairs or by transferring entanglement from
the environment to the BH, resulting in the unacceptable situation described in ยง2.
