(d) First Approximation to B’, and = (»8,—v8_,).

In this case, owing to the fact that the central element in the numerator
determinants of (5°36) and (5°39) is zero, we have to deal with the third order
determinant in order to obtain a first approximation. From (5°15)-(5°18) it is easy
to see that V(dngban) may be obtained from V(djn@ma), each being limited to the

three central rows and columns, if we replace a, and divide the top and

B
by —% an,
bottom rows respectively by \; and —),. ME 795 Ws the third order determinant
obtained from V (4,2) is equal to ae ( ih) A, The value of V’,(djanPmn) is

similarly (cf. §5 (/) for the definition of this determinant),
