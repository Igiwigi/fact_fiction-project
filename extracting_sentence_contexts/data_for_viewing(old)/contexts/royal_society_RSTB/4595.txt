The most important deduction to be derived from a study of the reproductive system
of Archotermopsis concerns the soldier caste. These organs show a gradual pro-
gressive development, from the condition seen in the young larve to that attained
in the adult soldiers. Neither degeneration nor arrestation of development is to
be detected at any period, and a study of the histology of both ovaries and testes
lends strong support to their being functional organs in that caste. The gonads
and the associated parts attain as large a size, and are as completely developed, as
in the winged males and females prior to leaving their nest. It has already been
pointed out that it is possible to select a series of species in which the gonads of
the sterile castes exhibit progressive stages in reduction, until we â€˜reach the condition
found in Butermes monoceros, where they are apparently wanting altogether. This
fact itself affords strong evidence in support of the conclusion that caste production
is not in any way associated with the condition of the gonads.

E. OBSERVATIONS ON THE BroLoGy OF THE SPECIES.

So far as known this Termite is restricted in the distribution to the North-West
Himalaya and Kashmir. I have found it at elevations ranging from 4000 to
