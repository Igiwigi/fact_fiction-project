Since r/a appears in that equation, the ‘relaxation pattern’ is
different for every row of nodes parallel to Oz. For example, when 7) = 3a so that
7 = 13 = 3a, ry = 4a, ry = 2a, the effects of unit displacement at 0 (i.e. dé) = 1) are
easily seen to be

AF,=—4, AF,=4F,=1, 4F,=+, 4AF,=4, (24)
—summing neae but not exactly} to zero. Allowance for one or more short strings in an
‘irregular star’ is easily made (if required) ¢ on the basis of ‘fictitious nodes’ lying outside
the boundary.

14. Except that a variety of ‘relaxation patterns’ is entailed, the liquidation process
follows exactly on the lines described in previous papers of this series, and it presented
no difficulty in the example which follows. (This was treated by D. N. de G.
