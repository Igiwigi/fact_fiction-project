the clustered or the solitary. Thus
in the Pig the clustered cells attained an average depth of 595 mm., whilst the dense
confluent series in the Rabbit average +506 mm. The depth, however, affords but an
imperfect guide to the relative richness of the stratum in cells—a better notion is
gained by the fact that the quarter-inch field will reveal in the confluent series as many
as 90 to 100 cells, whilst the laminar series will give to the same power not over
6 or 8 cells.

2. Form of cell. —The cell of this series is usually an elongate pyramid, although
the oval and large fusiform cell is occasionally met with, as is also a bifurcate or horned
cell; the latter, however, far less common than in the Sheep and Pig.
