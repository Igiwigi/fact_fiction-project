The last number is not far from the approximate limit calculated for the p series,
and it is suggested that the lines at \ 3615 form the p doublet while the other pair is
a combination derived from this and the limit of the “ 4481” series (f # —3p, or
2d—3p).

A striking confirmation of this conclusion is afforded by the fact that the term 28
for the Wide doublet series (Table VI.) is 51,464°2. This is not only in close
accordance with the limit for p calculated above, but is an important indication of the
intimate connection of the two systems of doublets. It will suffice for the present to
note that the limit of the p series of “F.P.” doublets appears to be given by the
difference between the limit of the subordinate Wide doublets and the wave-
number of the first observed S line which has a posttive value; or, symbolically,
poe =28 =Sw-S (2).

The agreement is too close to be regarded as accidental, and assuming the relation
to be true, the limit of the p series can be determined very exactly. The limit of the
“4481” series (giving 2D and thence S) has been found with considerable precision
and the wave-number of the line \ 2936°496 giving S (2), has also been accurately
