(d) Discussion a

It is clear that a transformation of a coordinate in the longitudinal direction has a fundamentally [8
different effect on the Cherenkov radiation than a transformation of a coordinate perpendicular [5
to the direction of propagation, as can be seen in figure 8. This is related to the fact that 23
a transformation perpendicular to the trajectory of the charged particle only stretches the
Cherenkov cone, whereas a transformation along the path of the charge also alters the velocity

of the charge in the underlying electromagnetic space. As soon as this velocity drops below

the speed of light c/np, Cherenkov radiation ceases to exist. This Cherenkov cut-off is visible

in figure 8b, when the longitudinal scaling factor F approaches c/(n,v) =0.5. In this respect, a
longitudinal coordinate transformation has a remarkable effect. Consider, for example, a charged

particle travelling through a dielectric (with refractive index mp) at a velocity v smaller than the
