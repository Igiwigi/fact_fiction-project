Resemblance in some respects, together with marked dissimilarity in others, is not
uncommon among members of related groups, and the present findings must be considered
to afford additional evidence for regarding the elephants as being phylogenetically related
in some degree both to the Perissodactyla and to the Hyracoidea. REPRODUCTION OF THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT 139

The provision of numerous corpora lutea, which comprise a considerable mass of luteal
tissue throughout gestation, and their precipitate decline at term, with the destruction of
luteal cells, suggests that they play a vital part in the maintenance of pregnancy for
a total period which is apparently about 22 months. That the accessory corpora lutea
which are formed at about mid-term and replace those of the earlier part of gestation are
in fact ‘active’ in the sense that they produce or contain progesterone has been demon-
strated by Mr D. G. Edgar’s work on the preserved material.
