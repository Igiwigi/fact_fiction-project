Though this type of branching has not been previously recognized for Drepanophycus,
there are indications of it in earlier descriptions. The clearest of these is in a specimen
from Scotland figured by Kidston (1893, figure 2), who speaks of the narrow down-
wardly directed branch as ‘perhaps a root’.

The Llanover specimens clearly demonstrate that this H-shaped type of branching,
first found in Zosterophyllum myretonianum, was a feature of the presumably basal or
rhizomatous region of Drepanophycus. It must be taken into account in picturing the
probable growth of the plant, and the reconstruction suggested by Krausel & Weyland
(1935) requires amendment in the light of it. It is as regards this branching and the
recognition of the fertile shoots in Britain that the Llanover material has added to our
knowledge. But further, the fact that this widely distributed plant is established as a
member of the Senni Beds flora is of stratigraphical significance.

Pieces of stem and branch systems bearing projecting spines, or marked by the places
of insertion of spines, were fairly abundant at Llanover. The natural inference on
inspecting them is that they demonstrate the presence in the flora of a plant of the

* Since this was written, branching of this type has been recorded in specimens of Drepanophycus from
Belgium (Stockmans 1940).
