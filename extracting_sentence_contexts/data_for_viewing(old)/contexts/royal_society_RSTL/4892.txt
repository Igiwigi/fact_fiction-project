ice for ever after, why is the horizontal projection or ground plan of the crevasses of
a canal-Shaped glacier convex towards the origin of the glacier, and not protuberant
in the direction of its motion, as the ascertained greater velocity of the centre would
as8ign? Why are the crevasses for the most part vertical and not inclined forwards,
or at least not notably s0, on the same account? Why, if the glacier be urged down-
wards by a longitudinal force distending it, do not the erevasses continually widen
in proportion as they are further from the origin? These questions seem incapable
of a sound answer except by supposing that the crevasses are, at least in a great de-
gree, the fresh production of every spring, and arise from the sudden start which the
glacier makes when that extremity which descends into the valley begins to experi-
ence the thawing effects of returning 8summer. I should not wish to speak poxitively
upon what involves a difficult if not impossible observation,—the state of the glacier
with respect to crevasses whilst till under the winter's covering of «now. But the fact

of the transverse direction of the crevasses, or even their convexity towards the origin,
from year to year, Seems to admit of no other explanation. But besides this, I can
affirm, from a careful observation of the crevasses of the Mer de Glace from June to
September in one year, that the changes which they underwent were such as pre-
clude the possibility of a crevasse of autumn being merely preserved by the snow of
winter, and re-appearing afresh in spring as it had done the previous one. The thing
