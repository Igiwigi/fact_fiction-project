The general form of the skull at this stage is similar to that which is described by
Vorr (1909), and consequently there is no necessity for describing it here. One point,
however, deserves further consideration, and that is the way in which the fenestra
rotunda and the aqueductus cochlee are substituted for the original foramen
perilymphaticum. This matter was briefly described but not figured by Vorr.

Looked at from below, or from the median side through the foramen jugulare, it
can be seen that the ventral margin of the foramen perilymphaticum, which is formed
by the hind edge of the floor of the cochlear capsule, is drawn out into a process.
This process extends upwards across the mouth of the foramen perilymphaticum towards
the floor of the canalicular capsule, with which it will eventually fuse, and in so doing
it encloses the recessus scale tympani from beneath. For this reason, and also for the
fact that it lies over and not in the plane of the mouth of the foramen perilymphaticum,
this process, which Vorr called the processus intraperilymphaticus, has been termed
processus recessus by DE Brrr (1929).

region are disposed.
