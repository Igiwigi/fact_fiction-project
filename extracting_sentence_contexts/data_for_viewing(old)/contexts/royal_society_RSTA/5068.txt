(a ~ 35°-36°) [42] and by Chaudhri & Kurkjian (a ~ 33.5°) [61] for commercial borosilicate glasses
with v ~0.2. For a soda-lime-silica glass (typical window glass composition), the cone angle
a is approximately 22° [55,62]. For alumina (v ~ 0.24) and an Alj03/SiC composite (v ~ 0.25),
a ~ 26° and 28°-31°, respectively [63]. For vitreous carbon (v ~ 0.27-0.29) the angle the cone (ball
indentation test) makes with the surface is 22.5° on average [64]. Fischer-Cripps & Lawn [65]
obtained a cone angle of 19° for a silicon nitride ceramic (v ~ 0.27). Therefore, as was noted by
Bertoldi & Sglavo [42], although the angle is not severely affected by the indenter geometry, it is
very sensitive to the glass composition and especially to Poisson’s ratio. Note that the effect of v
on a was already mentioned by Lawn et al. [55] who noted that v has a profound influence on the
stress field and further attempted to ‘tune’ the v value to get their modelling to match better with
the experimental results for a.

There is strong evidence for the fact that in glasses susceptible to experience a density increase
(be it due to a high pressure treatment or to a local indentation), densification is assisted by the
presence of a concomitant shear stress component [66,67]. It turns out that the profiles for the
shear isocontours change much with v, and that the overall region associated with a shear stress
larger than a given value extends with v, especially along the xy-plane (surface). The maximum
shear stress (equation (3.11)) is represented for three different glasses in figure 15 (second row).

4. Search for a constitutive law

A better description of the indentation problem in glass requires a specific, physically sound,
constitutive law for the mechanical behaviour of this particular class of materials. This raises
various kinds of difficulties, at the fundamental level of the physics of the deformation
mechanisms, and at the practical level of the implementation in FEM software. However, it is
