Sore simply be considered as duplicates. Indeed, the character of the results in the one
Experiment with Wheat, and in the two with Barley, in 1857, was 0 similar, that the
Fhree experiments may be considered as triplicates.

5 It will be observed that the largest gain of Nitrogen in the three experiments with
inacee in 1857 was 0-0026 gramme. Keeping in view the probable source of
error due to the use of lates in that year, and the difference of result in 1858 when
Slates were not employed, and, again, considering the fact that 80 8mall an amount of
Nitrogen had to be determined in such a large amount of soil (0-003 gramme or less of
Nitrogen in about 1500 grammes of 8011), it seems indeed more than questionable whether
the gain should not be attributed to the errors of experiment or analysis alluded to. In
act, we can but conclude that, under the cireumstances of growth of the Graminaceous
Plants to which Table XII. relates, there has been no assimilation of free Nitrogen.
It should also be noticed that, even when a gain of Nitrogen in the total products is
-observed, there Is, in no case, more Nitrogen in the plant itself than in the original
