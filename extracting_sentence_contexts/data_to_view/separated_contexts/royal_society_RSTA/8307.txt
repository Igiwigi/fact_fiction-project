This triplet is more
strongly shown in Stmeon’s photograph and has also been recorded by MiuuiKkan. The triplet of the first sharp series has only been partially recorded. Its position
with respect to the first diffuse triplet is accurately known from the fact that the interval
separating the two is identical with that separating the triplets at 4 4552 and 4 3086. The triplet lies beyond the region photographed by the author, but the first two members
appear near the limit of sensitivity on Smmon’s plate. AT SUCCESSIVE STAGES OF IONISATION. 31

With the term 2d roughly determined from the above formule, and by assuming
a value for the first f term, which is nearly the same for most series, it seemed probable
that the first member of the fundamental series must be the complex line about 4 1500.
