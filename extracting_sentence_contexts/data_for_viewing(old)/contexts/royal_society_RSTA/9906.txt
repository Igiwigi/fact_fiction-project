unconvincing in the absence of any exact knowledge as to the connection of wave-
length with atomic weight, even supposing such connection existed.

Our knowledge of series spectra is chiefly—one might say almost wholly—due to
the sets of very exact measurements of Kayser and Runes, and of Runer and
PascHEen, supplemented by extensions to longer and shorter wave-lengths by
Beramann, Konen and Hacensacu, LeaMann, Ramace, and Saunpers. These
have been only ‘quite recently added to by Pascuen* and by the remarkable
extension of the Sodium Principal series up to 48 terms by Woop.t A most
valuable feature of Kayser’s work was the publication of possible errors of obser-
vation. This has rendered it possible to test with certainty whether any relation
suggesting itself is true within limits of observational error or not. In fact, without
this, the investigation, of which the present communication forms a first part, could
not have been carried out. So far as the author knows, SAUNDERS is the only other
observer who has accompanied his observations with estimates of this kind. Others
have given probable errors—practically estimates of the exactness with which they
can repeat readings of that feature of a line which they take to be the centre—an
estimate of little value for the present purpose. In deducing data from a set of
lines it is thus possible to express their errors in terms of the original errors in the
observations, and limits to the latter give limiting variations to the former. We
therefore know with certainty what latitude in inferences is permissible, and are
often enabled to say that such inference is not justifiable.

The formule of Ryppere or of Kayser and Runex are sufficient in general to
