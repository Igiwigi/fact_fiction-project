One example is the IceCube
neutrino experiment at the South Pole [5]. Muon detection has been an important component of
the CMS and ATLAS experiments at CERN and played an important role in the discovery of the
Higgs boson in 2012 [6,7]. In fact, CMS is an acronym for ‘Compact Muon Solenoid’, emphasizing
the importance of muon detection for the experiment. In 2003, researchers at Los Alamos National
Laboratory published a seminal paper [8] on imaging with cosmic-ray muons that showed for the
first time how the Coulomb scattering of muons in matter could be used for imaging applications. Previously, only information from the absorption of muons in matter had been used.
