Slits were placed in the red and green at the standard positions red Li and
SSN 37°5 (standard scale number) in the green and as good a match as possible was
made by mixtures of the two colours with the intermediate spectral colours, to which
a little white was added. The amount of white added was not considered, but only
the white inherent in the green. This last was deducted from the green and the
percentage of red and green sensations in each colour calculated without taking into
account the white which was due to the presence of the blue sensation. From the
equations were obtained the percentage of red and green when the white present in
each colour was included, and by the last measures the percentage of red and green
when such white was excluded. From these different percentages it was easy to
calculate the amount of blue sensation present, for it only exists in the ‘inherent
white.” On subsequently considering the sensation curves of equal stimulation as
given by Ka@nre and myself, my attention was called to the fact that at the place
where the red and blue curves cut a large and very sudden increase of white inherent
in the colour should be seen, so large indeed that it would never escape notice. The
colour at that point ought to be much paler than colours close to it, but such is not
the case. The new measures show that there is no sudden rise in the amount ot
white present in any colour, and that the maximum of white is at SSN (standard
scale number) 43 (4 5427) and not at 37°5 (A 5150). This point will be referred to
later.

(7.) Measures from the Blue-green to the Violet.

The measures taken from the blue-green to the violet were made by the same
method as described in the paper above mentioned, but the process was much
