is continuous across the sonic arc, we still have (5.10) along Ionic on the side of 2. Thus, we have
the following result.

Theorem 5.1. Let (U, V,p, p) bea solution of one of our problems, problems 2.3, 3.3 and 4.3, for system
(5.6)-(5.9), such that (U, V,p, p) is C°* in the open region formed by the reflection—diffraction shock and
the wedge boundary, and the gradient of the tangential component of (U, V) is continuous across any sonic
arc. Let Qzg be the subregion of 2 formed by the fluid trajectories past the sonic arc. Then, in Qz, the
potential flow equation (2.5) with (2.6) coincides with the full Euler equations (5.6)—(5.9), that is, equation
(2.5) with (2.6) is exact in domain Q¢ for problems 2.3, 3.3 and 4.3.

Remark 5.2. The regions such as 92g also exist in various Mach reflection—diffraction
configurations. Theorem 5.1 applies to such regions whenever the solution (U, V,p, p) is C°? and
the gradient of the tangential component of (U,V) is continuous. In fact, theorem 5.1 indicates
that, for the solution g of (2.5) with (2.6), the Cll regularity of g and the continuity of the
tangential component of the velocity field (U, V) = V¢ are optimal across the sonic are Ionic.

Remark 5.3. The importance of the potential flow equation (1.1) with (1.2) in the time-
dependent Euler flows even through weak discontinuities was also observed by Hadamard [51]
through a different argument. Moreover, for the solutions containing a weak shock, the potential
flow equation (1.1) and (1.2) and the full Euler flow model (5.1) match each other well up to the
third order of the shock strength. Also see Bers [52], Glimm & Majda [2] and Morawetz [22].

As we have discussed above, the three long-standing, fundamental transonic flow problems
