This amount of oxidation product, C,s;H,,0,, would require 3-05 c.c. of N/10 NaOH to
neutralise an opened lactone structure and 6-10 ¢.c. to neutralise an anhydride structure. The product is therefore probably of the lactone type. As far as can be assumed from the foregoing facts it appears that the
oxidation product obtained by the action of alkaline permanganate on dimethyl A
has the empirical formula C,;H,,0,, contains two methoxyl groups, and has probably
a lactone structure.

(3) Products obtained by fusing product A with potassium hydrowide.—As already
noted, p. 288, product A is resistant to the action of boiling aqueous 30 per cent. alkali. Accordingly 4 gm. of A were fused in a nickel crucible with 15 gm. of potassium hydroxide
and 8 c.c. of water. The crucible was heated in a bath of fusible metal maintained at
a temperature of 300° C. for 14 hours.
