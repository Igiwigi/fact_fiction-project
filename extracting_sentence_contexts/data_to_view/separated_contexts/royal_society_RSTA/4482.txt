However, Fischhoff also points out that reframing the debate in
terms of ‘what gambles we want to take with the natural world’ (p. 703) could galvanize
decisions. In this issue, the article by Ballard & Lewandowsky [59] also addresses the notion of how

reframing uncertainty can enhance people’s responses to climate change. They highlight the fact : 2
that projections typically express uncertainty in the outcome itself, but not in the outcome’s time : =
of arrival. For example, projections reported by the IPCC generally imply statements along the {5
lines of ‘by year X, average global surface temperature will rise by between Y1 and Y2 degrees’. bo
The authors argue that reporting projections in this manner invites wishful thinking, because it : <
increases the perceived variance in the outcome. Reframing this projection so that the uncertainty Do
is expressed in the time of arrival can reduce the potential for wishful thinking.
