4 and 6 and the information in Table IV. The factors that have to be considered are

(1) the mean + and â€” departures at no moon and full moon ;

(2) the fact that the differences are at their minimum in June and maximum in
October ;

(3) the alteration in asymmetry of the corrections from the months before mid- -
June to those after. With these facts as a basis, there has finally been added to fig. 7 a third curve
(dotted) showing the 29-day mean corrected as nearly as possible for the lunar
influence. It will immediately be seen how much more closely the curve fits the changes in
the log histogram, than did the 29-day mean ; thereby showing what a high pro-
portion of the variation is due to the lunar influence.
