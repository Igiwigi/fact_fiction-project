A superficial examination of the series of the different alkali elements shows that
Li apparently occupies an anomalous position, and leads to the surmise that the series
are not homologous with those of the other elements. Thus, if the fiyst lines of the
principal series in each be compared, viz., [

Li. Na. K. Rb. Cs.
6708 5890 7665 7805 8527

it is seen that the wave-lengths continually decrease with decreasing atomic weight
until we arrive at Li, when the wave-length jumps back above Na. Further from
analogy with the others LiP (1) should be a doublet with v = 1:5 about, and the LiS
and LiD should be all doublets of the same v, but, as a fact, they are all single, with
the possible exception of 4602, which Konen and Hacenpacu believe to be a double
line. For this reason in my first examination I left Li for separate consideration,
and as this was fully justified by the result, it may be well to proceed on the same
lines now. We shall discuss then first the well-known principal, sharp, and diffuse
series of the other alkalies, then the additional series which appear in the spectra,
and finally return to Li in the light of knowledge gained from the others.

The first step is to justify the use of the form m+.4+«/m for the denominator, by
showing how closely it reproduces the observed lites. This is done in Table I. For
comparison the results as calculated from Rrrz’ formula are also given. Jn each
series the first column (O) gives the possible observational error, the second (H) the
excess of observed over the calculated wave-length, and the third (R) the corre-
