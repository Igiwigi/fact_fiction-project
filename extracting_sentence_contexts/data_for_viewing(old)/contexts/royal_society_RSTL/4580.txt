strength as 25,030 : 18,591, or as 1: 742, the comparative strength of a single riveted
plate of equal area through the line of the rivets. It will be observed that in this
comparison the areas of the sections are nearly equal, and consequently there is a
difference in strength between the solid part of the plate and that part where the
perforations have been made of 32 per cent. The difference is considerable, but it
probably arises from the narrowness of the specimen and the lateral strain induced
by the position of the rivet, and the bending upwards of the end of the plates. From
these facts I would infer that single riveting is weaker, and probably the loss of
strength in this description of joint, including loss caused by the rivet-holes, is not
less, under ordinary circumstances, than 40 per cent.
