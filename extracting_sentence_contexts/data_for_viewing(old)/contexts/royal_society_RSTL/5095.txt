the observations at these stations and the observations which by concerted arrange-
ment may have been made simultaneously with them at other observatories. In all
such comparisons the modifying influence of hours and periods of the year shown in
the first and second sections of this paper, must be kept in view; and it must also be
remembered that the evidence of the general character of these magnetic affections,
which may be afforded by the comparison of the observations of the Declination
alone, may be expected to be greatly strengthened when the disturbances of the
Inclination and of the Total Force shall have been subjected to a similar process. The
evidence furnished by a single element must necessarily be partial and incomplete.

Recurring now to the ratios in Table XIIL., and directing our attention to the
character of the inequality which they show to have existed in the amount of
disturbance in different years, the facts which present themselves most obviously
and unquestionably to our notice are, that in the years 1843, 1844 and 1845, the
ratios were uniformly considerably less than unity, and that in the years 1846, 1847
and 1848, they were as uniformly considerably greater than unity. The mean ratios

in the three first years are, at Toronto 0'69, and at THobarton 0-68 ; whilst in the
three last years they are at Toronto 1:33, and at Hobarton 1-34, Facts of such
remarkable character, evidenced by the independent and concurrent testimony of 80
large a body of observations at stations 80 widely distant from each other, seem
to be well deserving the consideration of magnetical physicists ; more particularly
