persistence of fluid in rare instances, but these can hardly be regarded as exception
to the statement that loss is not followed by renewed secretion ; that there is n
active re-formation of vacuoles if the direct descendants of the vacuoles of ingestio

the act by which they are ejected.
In the following Table I have gathered together most of the numerical result
