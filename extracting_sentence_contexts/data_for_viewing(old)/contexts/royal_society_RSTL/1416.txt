in form and appearance, the feces of the spotted or Cape
Hyzna, which he stated to be greedy of bones, beyond all other
beasts under his care. This information I owe to Dr. WorLLas-
Tox, who has also made an analysis of the suhstance under dis-
cussion, and finds'it to be composed of the ingredients that
might be expected in fecal matter derived from bones, viz.
phosphate of lime, carbonate of lime, and a very small pro-
portion of the triple phosphate of ammonia and magnesia ; it
retains no animal matter, and its originally earthy nature and
affinity to bone, will account for its perfect state of preservation.

I do not know what more conclusive evidence than this can
be added to the facts already enumerated, to show that the
hyznas inhabited this cave, and were the agents by which
the teeth and bones of the other animals were there collected ;
it may be useful therefore to consider, in this part of our en-
quiry, what are the habits of modern hyenas, and how far
they illustrate the case before us.

The modern hyzna (of which there are only three known
Species, all of them smaller and different from the fossil one )
is an inhabitant exclusively of hot climates ; the most savage,
or striped species, abounds in Abyssinia, Nubia, and the ad-
Jacent parts of Africa and Asia. The less ferocious, or
spotted one, inhabits the Cape of Good Hope, and lives prin-
