The
frequency range considered includes the octave band with centre frequency 2 kHz. For reasons of
computational efficiency, the very time-consuming sound propagation calculations for the 2kHz
octave band were not performed (and the 1 kHz band results were recycled). This is justified by
the fact that atmospheric absorption becomes pronounced at these higher frequencies and source
power levels start to drop; a more accurate assessment of the propagation at this band would,
therefore, only slightly increase accuracy when assessing total noise exposure levels from the
wind turbine.


6. Conclusion

A hybrid analytical-CM-GFPE methodology is presented to model sound propagation from a
ridge-mounted wind turbine, represented here by an elevated point source above the ridge, across
an adjacent valley. The hybrid method relies on an analytical solution for sound diffraction around
an impedance cylinder and the CM-GFPE technique.
