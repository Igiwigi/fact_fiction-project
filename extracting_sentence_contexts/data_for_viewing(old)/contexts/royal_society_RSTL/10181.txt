These facts are of considerable interest viewed in connexion with the great dit-
ference in the character of the food of the different animals ; the ruminants consuming
such a large proportion of fibre, much of which is indigestible ; and the well-fed pig
but little indigestible matter, and a relatively large proportion of starch, the primary
transformations of a large part of which are supposed to take place after leaving the
stomach, and more or less throughout the intestinal canal. With the great variations
which the figures show in the proportion of the receptacles and first laboratories of the
food, with their contents, the further elaborating organs (if we may 80 say), with their
fluids, appear to bear a much more uniform relation by weight to the entire body in
the different descriptions of animal.

The results further showed that whilst during the fattening process the total
©* carcass” parts increased both in actual weight and in percentage in the entire body,
