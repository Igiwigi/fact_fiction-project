Other non-invasive imaging techniques, such as magneto- and elec-
tro-encephalography present no advantage over fMRI when it comes
to inferring single unit activity. They present better temporal resol-
ution traded off against a worst spatial resolution.

â€œThere are a few exceptions of single unit recordings in humans,
obtained from neurologic patients undergoing brain surgery. While
informative, these data are limited by the fact the neuro-anatomical
targets cannot be chosen freely and that findings may not generalize
to the general population [41]. Of course, there is a lot of information to be gained also in the case
where humans and monkeys do not display the same decisions and
biases. Such differences currently represent a strong area of research
in comparative psychology and ethology [44].
