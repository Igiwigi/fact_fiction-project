Using equation (2.12), it is not difficult to derive an expression for the longitudinal static
susceptibility of an antiferromagnetic nanoparticle. Taking into account that factor Z and (cos” 9)
in the zeroth order in q are

This means that the longitudinal static magnetic susceptibility of an antiferromagnetic particle is
given by the expression

X= [! - a Bro Re) (2.19)

The first term, written in square brackets, determines the susceptibility of a completely
compensated antiferromagnet (8 =0). The solid line in figure 4a demonstrates that this term
decreases monotonically with increasing o (that is, with diminishing temperature), going down
to zero at o > oo (T > 0), in accordance with the fact that function R’(o)/R(c) tends to unity, see
figure 4b. Interestingly, at 6 40, the longitudinal static susceptibility has a minimum at some value
of the parameter o (that is, temperature), see the dotted (6 =0.3) and dashed (6 =0.5) lines
in figure 4a. This behaviour is due to the fact that the second term of x, proportional to the
square of the decompensation parameter £, does not decrease, but rises with a growth of o.
