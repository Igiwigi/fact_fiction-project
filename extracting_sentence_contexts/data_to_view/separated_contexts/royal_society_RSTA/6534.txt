The obvi-
ous candidates were fluids, superfluids and superconductors (all of which can support
vortices of different kinds), liquid crystals and solid crystals (which can contain dis-
locations): in some of these areas, such as superconductivity, line singularities are
generally desirable, but in others, such as liquid crystals, they are not. Three points immediately arise when considering the relationship between line
singularity models and practical situations. The first is the fact that the positions
of mobile line singularities are almost always unknown a priori so that any mathe-
matical model needs to predict their dynamics. Secondly, clarification is needed of
the abstraction in which what is in practice a ‘core’ of finite radius (or characteristic
length scale) is replaced by a line of zero radius. Finally it must be realized that
interest is often centred on samples containing many, many line singularities.
