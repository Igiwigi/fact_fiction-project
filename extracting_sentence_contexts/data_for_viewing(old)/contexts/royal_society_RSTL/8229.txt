The next metal experimented on was barium, an element of much lower atomic weight
than lead, and in this respect, occupying a position not very much above the mean atomic
weight of the elements. It was s00n found that the facts obseryed with lead did not
completely hold with regard to barium, although they include the phenomena presented
by the chloride, bromide, and iodide. Even with these salts, however, the phenomena,
though the same in kind, differ 80mewhat in degree. For instance, the same number of
metallic lines was observed in all these salts, and between the appearance of the chloride
and the bromide spectrum there was no appreciable difference. In the case of the
iodide, however, there was a sensible change in the direction expected from the behayiour
of leadâ€”4. e. the spectrum became dimmer, that is, exhibited a tendency to die out.

When, however, baric fluoride was examined, a different state of things was observed.
Instead of the spectrum becoming more complex it became simpler, exhibiting in fact
only the four longest lines of barium with any degree of distinctness, and these showing
but little brilliancy.

STRONTIUM and MAGNESIUM.

Strontium behaved in this particular in the same way as barium did, the falling off of
the lines in the fluoride being very marked. In the case of magnesium (which, as regards
its chloride, bromide, and iodide, followed the behaviour of the alkali metals, to which I
shall immediately refer, rather than that of barium and strontium), the fluoride exhi-
bited the same stubborn resistance to the action of the spark. It is to be remarked that
these three fluorides are non-volatile, and s0 infusible that even after long exposure to
the current there was little or no indication of coherence ; in fact, in the case of mag-
