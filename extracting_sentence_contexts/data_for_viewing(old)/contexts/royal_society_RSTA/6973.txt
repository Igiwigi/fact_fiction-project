is most easily obtained from an examination of the elements of the reciprocal matrix Aâ€œ,

the solution of (B. 2) being given by
ian. (B. 3)

Now consider, as comparative examples, the solution of the sets of finite-difference equa-
tions typified by (A.6) and (B.1), representing respectively the plane-harmonic and
biharmonic equations, for the particular square boundary and mesh points shown in figure 9,
with symmetry about the axes and diagonals of the square.

It is assumed in each case that w is zero on the boundary, and that for the biharmonic
equation the normal derivative also vanishes there. Application of (B.1) at points adjacent
to the boundary introduces one fictitious external point, which, using the derivative condition,
is approximately equal to the corresponding internal point. For both problems then a set of

Ficure 9

simultaneous equations is obtained, one for each of the points numbered 1 to 10 in figure 9.
In equation (B. 2) the matrix A is composed of the coefficients of these equations, the vector
w has components w,,...,W 9, and the vector b is composed of the quantities 42f(x, y) or
h'f(x,y), that is, the initial residuals evaluated at the corresponding points.

Table 2 gives the computed elements of the matrix A~! for the biharmonic case. The
inverse matrix for the harmonic equation is given in table 3.
