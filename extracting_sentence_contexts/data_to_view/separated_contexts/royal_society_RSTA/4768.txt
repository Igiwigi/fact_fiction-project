In practice, one simply refers to a and a as the truncated
spectral operator and the truncated infinitesimal shift, respectively. The precise definition of the
cut-off function p\) is unimportant, provided p‘) is chosen so that the following computation
of the spectrum of a is justified (since (0) =c + iR, by theorem 4.1): 08) = ce(p (6(8))) =
[c —iT,c + iT]. Since a = p((9), the first equality follows from the spectral mapping theorem
(SMT) (applied to the unbounded normal operator d and the function pl; see [8, appendix E]),
while the second equality follows from the construction of p‘), In fact, when c #1, the only
requirement about pp) is that it be a C-valued, continuous function on c + iR = {Re(s) =c} whose
(closure of the) range is exactly equal to the vertical segment [c — iT,c + iT]. When c=1 (which
corresponds to the pole of ¢(s) at s=1), instead of requiring that p™) is continuous, we assume
that p) has a meromorphic continuous to a connected neighbourhood of {Re(s) =c}. Indeed,
when c #1 (resp., c= 1), we can then apply the continuous (resp., meromorphic) version of the
SMT given in [8, appendix E].
