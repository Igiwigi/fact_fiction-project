recting telomere length for age (but this does not allow for
the expected nonlinear relationship), and very few also control
for parental age at conception (but see [31,47,54,60,61]). In
other species, age has also rarely been fully controlled for
(table 1). Clearly, it would be better to sample parents and off-
spring at the same age (see section 4). One excellent study on
great reed warblers that did sample both parents and offspring
at the same age (8-10 days) found moderate heritability [31].
All the other non-human studies had shortcomings as they
did not control for offspring and parental age at sampling,
used an age-adjusted telomere length and/or only included
offspring age, and sometimes parental age, as a covariate in
the model (table 1). Thirdly, despite the fact that environ-
mental effects can vary spatially and temporally (see section
three), few studies have accounted for this in their analyses
(table 1). The one study undertaken under controlled labora-
tory conditions (thus reducing environmental variation) also
reduced shared environmental effects through cross-fostering
and reported a heritability value of 1 [72]. The very high herit-
ability estimate in this case is perhaps not surprising, because
once environmental variation is minimized the rest of the vari-
ation must be due to genetic effects. However, heritability
estimates taken under such conditions are of minimal use to
biologists wanting to understand the evolutionary and ecologi-
cal significance of telomere variation. Spatio-temporal
