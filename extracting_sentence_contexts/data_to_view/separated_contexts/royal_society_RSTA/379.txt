MacPDM has been run offline and therefore any feedbacks into the climate
system have not been included. It has also not been calibrated and_ its
yarametrizations have not been explored, although previous studies on smal
river catchments [44,45] find that climate model uncertainty is greater than
rydrological modelling uncertainty. In fact, we have found that as we move from
he PPE model data (temperature and precipitation) to MacPDM output (run-
off), the spatial correlation appears to increase pointing to the importance o
he model input parameters, such as soil type and land cover, in controlling
he resulting run-off, which may themselves change in the future owing to
direct impacts of climate change, adaptation responses and COz effects on planâ€™
water-use efficiency. The calculation of PE is included within MacPDM and is based on the
Penman-Monteith equation; as shown in recent studies [46,47], this coulc
ye another source of uncertainty. This issue may need to be explored in
future studies to determine the sensitivity of the CPDN ensemble to the PE
calculations.
