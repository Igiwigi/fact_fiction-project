When the curve is drawn corresponding (in this example) to that shown in fig. 6, the
irregularities in the successive values of As, which are due to the fact that the central
line has not been exactly central, disappear, and the curye turns out to be exactly
straight. Hence between the limits of velocity to which this experiment extends the
friction is perfectly constant. The tangent of the inclination of the line is measured and
found to be 01515, by (see fig. 6) being expressed in feet, and 3 in terms of the unit

t. To find 72 the acceleration in the direction of motion of a point in the circum-

ference of the disk in feet and 8econds, we must divide this quantity by (AZ)* in seconds.
Throughout all the experiments At was 03571 8econd. Hence for this example
