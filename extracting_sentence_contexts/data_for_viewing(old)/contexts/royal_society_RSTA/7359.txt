o’ (and therefore also 7) being measured from the place where ( = 0.

Since, after /= 0, @ is actually negative, tan@ is negative, and log (sec 4+ tan@) is
also negative, so that a’, and therefore also g, is positive, and increases with the time.

We have obtained a rough presentation of the development of an “‘incipient spin” of
moderate but stalled incidence. As time progresses the aeroplane turns downwards, as is
indicated by (23-17); its speed increases, as indicated by (23-16); its spin about the
vertical increases, as shown by (23-16); and the radius of curvature of the horizontal
projection of its path decreases, as shown by (23-18).

The applicability of these results is restricted by the fact that 7’ is of zero order, that
P, Q, R must not become large, and that c? cos / sin? ¢ cos ¢ is small compared to unity.

It can be shown that the restrictions amount to the condition that sin@ must be com-
paratively small, so that the results (23-16)—(23-18) only apply to the beginning of the
spin, if, at 7 = 0, there exists a rolling displacement ¢9, while the rolling rotation then
is zero, and the velocity u’ is not above a certain limit.

In order to deal with the later development of the spin we must use equation (23-11)
without the assumed restriction that ¢? cos @ sin? ¢ cos ¢ remains small.
