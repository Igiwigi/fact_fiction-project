spark from the end », which contained both portions of electricity, was a double
spark, It could not have consisted of two sparks taking separate courses, for such
an effect would havye been visiþble to the eye; but it is just possible, that the spark of
the first end » and its jar, passing at the smallest interval of time before that of the
other o, had heated and expanded the air in its course, and made it s0 much more
fayourable to discharge, that the electricity of the end o preferred leaping across to it
and taking a very circuitous route, rather than the more direct one to the ball. It
must, however, be remarked, in answer to this supposition, that the one spark between
d and e would, by its influence, tend to produce simultaneous discharges at n and o,
and certainly did 80, when no preponderance was given to one wire over the other,
as to the previous inductive effect (1414.).

1418. The fact, however, is, that disruptive discharge is favourable to itself, It is
at the outset a case of tottering equilibrium : and if time be an element in discharge,
in however minute a proportion (1436.), then the commencement of the act at any
point favours its continuance and increase there, and portions of power will be dis-
charged by a course which they would not otherwise have taken.

1419. The mere heating and expansion of the air itself by the first portion of elec-
tricity which passes, must have a great influence in producing this result.

1420. As to the result itself, we see its influence in every spark that passes; for it
is not the whole quantity which passes that determines the discharge, but merely
that small portion of force which brings the deciding molecule (1370.) up to its
maximum tension ; then, when its forces are subverted and discharge begins, all
