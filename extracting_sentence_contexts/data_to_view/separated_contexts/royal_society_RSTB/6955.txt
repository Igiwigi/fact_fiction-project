The method of stimulation used makes it
possible to apply a precise and highly localized stimulus to the neurohypophysis, and the
nerve fibres supplying this organ are relatively insensitive to electrical stimulation. In group A were rabbits in which the stimulating tip of the electrode was situated at
varying distances from the neurohypophysis and in which the anti-diuretic responses
obtained on stimulation were few in number. That these responses were not due to direct
stimulation of the neurohypophysis or its nerve supply is apparent from the evidence
already given and from the fact that the number of positive responses obtained in the different
animals was not related to the proximity of the electrode tip to the neurohypophysis or any
known nerve supply of this organ. Thus, it is justifiable to assume that the few positive
responses seen in this group were of a non-specific nature, and it follows that the current
spread effective as a direct stimulus to the neurohypophysis was, with maximal or supra-
maximal stimuli, less than 1 mm. This point is well illustrated by reference to rabbits 18
and 27.
