3-51. Errors in reading and measuring the records

The error arising from measuring up the record may be estimated as follows. If acm. is
the amplitude and we assume that the maximum values a,,,, @,,,, etc., can be measured to
within --¢, independent of their magnitude, it can be shown that A(a2,) = 2e(a2,/N)? is a
good estimate of the error in the mean-square peak value, where N is the total number of
peaks measured. If is the horizontal component of acceleration, # = ka, where k gal/cm.
is a constant of the apparatus, and the second-order correction dg is #?/2g. Assuming that
each peak is sinusoidal, a? = 4a2, and dg = k?4a2,/2g; hence

A(g) = KA(az) /4g = Ke (az,/N)4/2g.
For a typical acceleration recorder record, N = 360, k = 9:81, (a2,)* = 0-4 and ¢ may be taken
as --0.1 cm., to allow not only for errors in measuring the amplitude but also for the fact
that individual peaks are neither truly sinusoidal in form nor of equal duration. This gives
6g=7-8 mgals and A(dg) =0-146 mgal. If we assume that the two horizontal components
are independent, then the error in the resultant will be the square root of the sum of the
squares of the errors in the individual components. If the mean-square values of both
components are equal, the total correction will be 15-6 mgals and the error only + 0-21 mgal.
The accuracy with which the records can be measured is therefore quite adequate. In the
case of the long-period pendulum records the scale factor k=19-6. The accuracy is there-
fore slightly inferior but still quite adequate. For the fluctuations of the chronometer marks
the situation is somewhat different. Details of the method of measuring have been given by
Meinesz (19414).
