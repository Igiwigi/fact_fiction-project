strengthens the view that the two lines seen in Nova Coronze may have had the same
origin. In comets, the more refrangible one is the least defined, and this was also
the case in the Nova. The two maxima were also seen in Nova Cygni (see p. 415),
but in that case the less refrangible one was only visible for a short time. I have
very little doubt that both in comets and Nove the two maxima were due to carbon.
In the laboratory experiments in connection with this point photographs have been
obtained, which show the compound group with a bright maximum of intensity about
468, at the same time leaving the least refrangible maximum (474) fairly bright, and
the two intermediate ones much weaker. It is not difficult to understand that under
difficult conditions of observation such a group should be mapped as two lines, one
corresponding to the maximuin at 468 and the other to that at 474.

Whatever the origin of the two lines, the fact of their being common to comets
and Nove is very significant.

It is rather remarkable that in Nova Coron the F line should remain visible for a
longer time than the line near 500, because in Nova Cygni it died away first, leaving
500 very bright to the end. It must be remembered, however, that the later observa-
tions by Mr. Stone were made under very difficult couditions, the F line itself being
“desperately faint,” so that the 500 line may very well have been overlooked. If the
observations could have been continued longer, it is not impossible that the line 500
might have been seen after F. The 500 line would also be more liable to be masked
by continuous spectrum than the F line, so that the presence of a brighter continuous
