If all the Liiders lines were of
@ual size, it might be supposed that there was an equal probability of each one completing i further penetration in any given interval of time, and in this case the relation between
the overall change of curvature and time would be of exponential form. In actual fact the
Geep observations cannot be fitted exactly by curves of exponential form, and the dis-
@epancy may be ascribed to the fact that the Liiders lines vary widely in size.
