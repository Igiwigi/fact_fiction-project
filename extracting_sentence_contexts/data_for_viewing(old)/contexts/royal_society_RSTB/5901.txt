THE RELATIONSHIP OF MICRO-ORGANISMS TO THE DECAY OF STONE, 119

for limestones from Westminster Hall, fig. 10, Plate 19, the Terrace and the Star Chamber
Court, and other places at the Palace of Westminster, fig. 5, Plate 17, fig. 7, Plate 18 ;
for a decaying Portland stone on the new Science Museum at South Kensington, fig. 4,
Plate 17; for brickwork at the Royal College of Music; and for terra-cotta at the
Victoria and Albert Museum,

It is seen then that these bacteria have been found in a surprisingly large number
of cases (in fact it is unusual to fail to demonstrate their presence), it must however
be clearly stated that the bacteria are not held to be responsible for the formation of
the sulphates in all these cases. This can readily and adequately be explained on
chemical and physical grounds (see ScHarFER (1981)), and it is not necessary to invoke
the aid of bacteria to explain the oxidation of atmospheric sulphur dioxide. The
existence of organisms possessed of the power to effect the oxidation of lower sulphur
compounds may however assist to explain certain difficult cases where a straightforward
explanation on other grounds is not easily forthcoming. Such an explanation on
biological grounds postulates the existence in stone of some form of oxidizable sulphur.
The brown colouration which frequently accompanies the deposition of sulphates
suggests that one source of sulphur may be iron pyrites. The occurrence of iron
oxide in the neighbourhood of the decay, at many of the castles in Scotland given in
the above list. was a notable feature, and it is perhaps significant that the stone for
