TI conclude, therefore, that
snch canals are wholly absent from some bundles as in fig. 9; that they are distinetly
present, but of small size, in such bundles as fig. 8, c; that they exist in similar position,
but of much larger dimensions, in such cases as figs. 1, 2-6, & 14; and that in examples
like fig. 7, such a canal, devoid of any true walls (being, in fact, a mere intercellular space),
has constituted a weak point, which has been converted into a larger irregular cavity
by the shrinkage of the neighbouring cellular tissues*. 'There yet remains to be considered the cortical layer of this curious plant. Here
again we meet with variations in different specimens.
