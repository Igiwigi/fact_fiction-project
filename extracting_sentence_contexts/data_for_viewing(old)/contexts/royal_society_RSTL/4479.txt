are most elevated in the scale deficient in the polar regions, but their relative number
decreases rapidly as we pass from the equator towards the pole. IV. The average
size of the Crustacea of tropical regions is considerably greater than that of the tribes
inhabiting temperate or frigid climes. V. It is where the temperature is most ele-
vated, that the peculiarities of structure which characterize the several groups are
most strongly manifested. And VI., there is a remarkable coincidence between the
temperature of different regions, and the prevalence of certain forms of Crustacea.—It
is interesting to obserye, that the want of a high temperature is no obstacle to the
growth and multiplication of individuals of a comparatively small size and low grade
of organization ; the Arctic and Antarctic seas being as numerously peopled with
such, as the tropical ocean is with higher forms. But the preceding statements point
to a direct and definite relation between Heat and the Organizing force, as mani-
fested in this group of animals. A comparison of the facts relating to the geographical
distribution of other classes of cold-blooded animals would probably justify the same
conclusions. There can be no doubt of their general applicability to the Vegetable
kingdom.

5. The influence of temperature upon the general vital activity of cold-blooded
animals is no less remarkable, The facts determined by the experiments of Dr. W. F.
Epwarps{ lead to this general conclusion ;—that the rate of life of Batrachia and
Fishes, of which the activity of their respiratory process is the exponent, varies
directly (within certain limits) as the temperature of the surrounding medium ; $0
that the duration of life, when these animals are deprived of air, either partially or
completely, or are placed in any other circumstances unfavourable to its sustenance,
varies inversely with the external temperature. Thus when frogs were confined in a
