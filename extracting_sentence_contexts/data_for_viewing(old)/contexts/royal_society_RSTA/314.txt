two experimental conditions. Traces in vitro were obtained in the presence of 100 4M t-ACPD.
(b) Simultaneous EEG and intracellular recordings from a cortical and a TC neuron in vivo show
the LTCP-mediated bursts of action potentials in the TC neurons to precede the UP state of the
cortical cell. (c) Local field potentials recorded from the lateral geniculate nucleus in vivo during
natural deep NREM sleep (top) and in a thalamic slice in the presence of t+ ACPD (504M). Both
traces show a characteristic slow rhythm at <1 Hz. The presence of this rhythm in a thalamic slice
indicates that mechanisms exist within the thalamus to elicit a synchronized (<1 Hz) output even
in the absence of a cortical input. Adapted with permission from Crunelli & Hughes [2].

field potential (at <1Hz) similar to those observed in vivo (figure 2c), and the
strong dependence of the slow oscillation frequency on membrane polarization
(see [2]) strongly argue for the slow oscillation in TC and NRT neurons as
being a pacemaker activity. In fact, it results from the membrane potential
bistability that is generated by the interplay of [Leak and the window component
of the low threshold Ca?+ current Fp (Itwindow) [36-39], such that the UP state
essentially corresponds to the condition when Ipyindow is active and the DOWN
state to when Ipwindow iS inactive [40,41]. Other membrane currents that are
essential for the expression of the slow oscillation in TC and NRT neurons include
Tcan (Ca?+-activated, non-selective cation current) and J, (hyperpolarization-
activated, Na*/Kt current) [2], which in the absence of synaptic inputs are the
