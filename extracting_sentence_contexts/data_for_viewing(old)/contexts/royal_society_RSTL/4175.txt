closes the circuit during the instant of time necessary for the formation of the arc.

3, The enormous elevation of temperature which accompanies the production of
the luminous arc, is also manifested in the electrodes, especially in the positive ones,
which become much more strongly heated than the negative.

4. Matter is thus transported from the positive electrode to the negative, a fact
which may be verified with electrodes of all kinds, but particularly with those of
charcoal.

5. The various phenomena presented by the voltaic arc, are modified to a greater
or less extent by the nature of the electrodes and by that of the surrounding medium.
Thus Mr. Grove adduces facts from which it appears that the presence of oxygen is
necessary in most cases to produce a very luminous and brilliant arc. It results also
from his experiments, as well as those of other philosophers, that when two different
snbstances are made use of for the electrodes, it is not a matter of indifference which
of the two is placed at the positive pole.

I now proceed to my own researches. I commenced by studying the production
of a luminous are between a plate and a point of the same material in air, and in
vacuo. By means of a micrometer screw I was able to make the point recede from
the plate very gradually, and judge of their mutual distance with great precision.
The limit of distance beyond which the luminous are ceases to appear, is constant
for the same plate and the same point : when, however, the plate communicates with
the positive pole, it is in general double that which it is when the point communi-
