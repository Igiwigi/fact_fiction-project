Once the
human/rodent has learned how to control the aversive stimu-
lus, fear declines and avoidance behaviour comes under the
control of other factors. Rodent studies have indicated an
important role for the ventral striatum in avoidance learning,


as well as connectivity with amygdala nuclei and prefrontal to some extent, human samples [7]. The fact that some of

cortical areas, which has been confirmed in a handful of these processes are difficult to model adequately in non-
human brain imaging studies [75]. In sum, experimental human animals points to the value of human pre-clinical and
studies have confirmed that the behavioural processes and clinical research. Developmental maturational processes also
neural circuitry of avoidance are, to some extent, different influence fear conditioning and extinction, particularly with
from fear.
