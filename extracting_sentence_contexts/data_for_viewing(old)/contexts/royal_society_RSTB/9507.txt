ity: the substantive field and content of expert evidence could
be just about anything, so long as it relates to a disputed ques-
tion of fact at issue in the proceedings. If English criminal
litigation is too conservative in its reception of novel or unortho-
dox science (criticism (12) in the ‘top 20’), it is not because
the formal rules of admissibility—before or after their recent
revision—are too restrictive in defining ‘experts’. A generic
approach does, however, entail that the rules are written at a
fairly high level of abstraction, often requiring significant
interpretational effort to apply them to the instant case.

On first principles [31-33] expert testimony adduced in
criminal trials must be both (i) relevant to a live fact in
issue (i.e. ‘material’ to the proceedings); and (ii) not otherwise
excluded by an applicable generic’? or expertise-specific
exclusionary rule. ‘Logic and common sense’ are the overrid-
ing criteria of relevance in English law—a foundational
precept of rationality in adjudication [34,35]. Although it is
conventionally said that expert evidence is admissible by
way of exception to ‘the opinion evidence rule’, this is an
unhelpful and potentially misleading canard. It presupposes
a clear distinction between ‘facts’ and ‘opinions’, where in


reality there is a continuum defined by different levels of Expert evidence deemed adequate for one juridical purpose | 4 |
