unipartite partitions of p and q, that appear in the bipartition, are separately
regularised.

Art. 30. Instead of insisting upon this two-fold regularisation, we may, starting
from the composition Poe eRe A ae

(Pris P2Yo. P3so «+ + PsMs)s

proceed to the singly regularised partition

(Pit Pit Py G2 Pit Ps + Ps G++ + PL).

There are, in fact, various ways of forming connecting links between compositions
and partitions of multipartite numbers whatever the order of multiplicity. These
methods may be pursued at pleasure so as to obtain results of more or less interest.

§ 3.

Art. 31. The correspondence set forth between unipartite partitions and bipartite
compositions naturally suggests the possibility of a similar correspondence between
bipartite partitions and tripartite compositions, and generally between m-partite
partitions and m + 1-partite compositions.

For the graph of the tripartite number pyr, we take r + 1 similar graphs of the
bipartite pg, and place them similarly with corresponding lines parallel, and like
