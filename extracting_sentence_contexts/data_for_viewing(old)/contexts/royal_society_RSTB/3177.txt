assumption, however, that the outward migration of the yolk nucleus at the
commencement of yolk formation is also passive, and due to general changes in the
surrounding cytoplasm, does not offer much difficulty. During yolk formation
we have a constant migration to the periphery of granules or droplets arising in
the body of the cytoplasm. As it is impossible to assume that this outward
migration is due to the activity of the droplets themselves, it must be concluded that
there are forces in operation in the egg during yolk formation which tend to send
formed bodies to the periphery. These forces may be of the nature of centrifugal
diffusion currents, or, as perhaps is more probable, are simply the result of an effort
on the part of the still metabolically active cytoplasm to remain in touch with the
nucleus. In either case, the presence of the nucleolar substance on the yolk-nuclear
area would serve to bring this structure under the influence of such forces, though
the fact that the yolk nucleus is itself, in part, composed of ordinary cytoplasm would
considerably weaken their action. This would explain why the yolk nucleus, though
always more or less peripheral in position during yolk formation, is never quite so; it
never competes with the “ peripheral spherules” of the yolk already referred to and
yet to be described for a position in actual contact with the vitelline membrane.

Thus the absence of any participation by the yolk nucleus of Antedon in the cell-
metabolism is indicated both by the origin of this structure as a region of the
cytoplasm on to which has diffused a portion only of the material intermittently
discharged from the nucleolus throughout the growth of the oocyte, and by the
fact that its subsequent behaviour can be entirely explained as due to the influence
on a semi-fluid mass of the varying physical conditions obtaining in the cell.
