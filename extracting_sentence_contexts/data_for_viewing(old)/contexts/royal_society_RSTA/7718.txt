the number of values taken by 7 being equal to the number of dimensions of the
space.

Quite analogous to these are the definitions of the components of the 6-vector A
(in 3 dimensions 3-vector) as integrals along any tubular surface S which joins the
lines L, and Ly, namely, the projections of S on the six coordinate planes, ¢.g.,

integrated over the portion of S bounded by L, and L,. Now if 2, and =, are any
two simple surfaces bounded by L; and L, respectively, on account of the fact that
S, 2,, and =, make a closed surface, A,, = (Z2),. — (4),, is the difference of a
function of the line L, and a function of the line L,. We shall call A the 6-distance
between the lines L, and Ly. It is clearly not a measure of the separation of the lines
in the ordinary sense for if L, can be transformed into L, by a simple translation,
then each of the components of the 6-distance between L, and L, vanishes. On the
other hand, the functional which corresponds to (5), namely

which is the area of the tube surface connecting L, and L,, does not vanish under the
same circumstances. Conversely, it is possible for |A| to vanish when none of the
