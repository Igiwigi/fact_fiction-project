Faced with a common approach to the underlying science,

approach the real issue that divides the experts.

I have had discussions over the years with the former
Regulator, and others, about the feasibility of producing stan-

plain English format. This is what is done to great effect in the

These ‘primers’ would be restricted to the areas on which
there is consensus among the scientific community. They
