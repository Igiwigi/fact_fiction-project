OV, =0°089 (1=y);

where y = (1+ Bh~**)~*, B having the value 6 for KCl and 4 for NaCl. At infinite
dilution for KCl, V, = 0°3068, and for NaCl, V, = 0°2125. By means of these formule we can calculate the solution volumes corresponding
to the concentrations at which Jany’s freezing-point observations were made, and
we find, as our theory led us to anticipate, that the effective molecular freezing-point

depression is in fact a linear function of the solution volume calculated from the
densities. ACL. VALVES @
