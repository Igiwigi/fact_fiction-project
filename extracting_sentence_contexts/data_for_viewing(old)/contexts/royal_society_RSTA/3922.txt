A greater degree of consensus exists, however, on the assignment of IP rights over the products
created by means of the use of a dataset, e.g. copyright in a scientific research paper. The right
to science has been mostly invoked in the latter sense and in defence of robust IP regimes. Such
regimes, however, can severely impede the dissemination of, and access to, scientific knowledge
and scientific advances on the part of the ordinary public. Limiting access to data or strictly
controlling knowledge dissemination on IP grounds risks according disproportionate weight to
one part of the right, thereby making the other part of it impossible or unduly burdensome to



exercise [35]. Granted that there might be several IP interests in data and their outcomes, the
question is whether all of these interests nonetheless generate the duty to protect them, when in
fact their protection will significantly impair our capacity to serve other interests or exercise other
rights.

A less familiar aspect of the right to science is its reference to participation in the cultural life
of the community, including ‘sharing in’ scientific advances. One interpretation of this aspect
includes the right of everyone to have the opportunity to make a contribution to scientific
advances through participation in scientific research. We have argued in other work that this
interpretation offers a strong normative underpinning for the so-called citizen science movement
[15]. People without formal scientific credentials have a right to engage in scientific inquiry, and
there is a societal duty to enable them to do so. With the new capabilities that the Internet and big
data analytics offer, one form of participation is through people collecting and sharing their own
health data for the purpose of scientific discovery. There are numerous platforms (public, private : =
or public-private) that provide such possibilities to willing individuals. New technologies enable 3
