Owing to the great ionising power of water, the conductivity of dilute aqueous
solutions is usually almost entirely heterolytic. With non-aqueous solvents it is
often quite otherwise, and it is even possible that in certain cases the conductivity of
the solution may be wholly autolytic. Thus it is stated that acetone and formic acid
give conducting solutions of the autolytes KCl, KBr and KI, but not of the heterolytes
HCl, and CCl, *CO,H (see Watprn and CrntNerszwer, ‘Zeit. Phys. Chem.,’
1902, vol. 39, p. 564), a result that is most easily explained by supposing that the
acetone acts merely as a solvent, but is not able to bring about heterolytie con-
duction.

The task of distinguishing between autolytic and heterolytic conduction is greatly
facilitated by the fact, which is brought out very clearly in the curve showing the
intrinsie conduetivity of sodium hydroxide at different concentrations, that whilst
heterolytic conductivity rises to a maximum in the most dilute solutions, autolytic
conductivity is greatest in the most concentrated solutions. The existence of
autolytic conductivity affords, therefore, a simple explanation of the increase of
molecular conductivity with concentration that has been not infrequently observed.
Two examples of this kind were recorded by Euxer (‘ Zeit. Phys, Chem.,’ 1899,
vol. 28, p. 622), who attributed the increase with concentration of the molecular
conductivity of sodium bromide and iodide to the influence of the salt in increasing
the ionising power of the solvent, that is, to an indirect, rather than to a direct,
autolytic influence. In two of the cases recorded by KaHLENBERG (‘ Journ. Phys.
Chem.,’ 1903, vol. 7, pp. 254-258) the molecular conductivity (of silver nitrate and of
ferrie chloride in amylamine) did not increase continuously with the concentration,
