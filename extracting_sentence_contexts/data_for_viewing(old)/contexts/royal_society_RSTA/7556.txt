of type {yz}, all those which can conceivably represent reducible forms. The remaining
classes, if such exist, will certainly represent irreducible forms. The system determined in
this way, for the various types {}, is not a priort necessarily complete, since owing to the possible
existence of syzygies some of the classes which apparently correspond to reducible forms may
prove to be irreducible. But it is certain that this system, so far as it goes, is irreducible.



456 J. A. TODD ON TERNARY QUADRATIC TYPES

It is evidently only necessary to consider types which appear in the table of the complete
system given in§ 71. For all these types the set of classes which certainly represent irreducible
forms is known. In fact, all the forms of degree eight or less are of a type which occurs for
four quadratics, and the corresponding classes were obtained (for any number of quadratics)
in Todd (1948). And the invariants of degree nine—the only remaining type—were dis-
cussed by Littlewood (1947), who proved the existence of the single irreducible class {371°}.
Combining the results of these two papers, the existence of irreducible concomitants of the
following classes and types is known.
