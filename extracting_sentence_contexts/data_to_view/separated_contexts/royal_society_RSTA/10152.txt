The correction on this account
was never greater than ‘04° C,

The method of heating with the vapours of boiling liquids worked extremely well. The jacket would take from 3 to 4 hours to arrive at a constant temperature, and
then neither thermometer would vary by ‘05° C. even in the worst cases, and it often
happened that both thermometers remained absolutely steady for hours. It is a
curious fact that the corrected readings of the two thermometers were rarely the
same. The difference was generally less than ‘1° C., but sometimes the upper and
sometimes the lower one would indicate the higher value. In calculating the results,
the temperature of the wire was always assumed to be that of the upper
thermometer, while the lower thermometer was taken as indicating the temperature
of the vibrator.
