Since the openings from the midgut into the digestive gland are large, the phago-
cytes cannot form a special provision for ingesting larger particles than those which
can enter the digestive gland, as YONGE (19264, 1931) suggests is the case in the lamelli-
branchs. Moreover, feeding experiments showed that all particles, whether large or
small, were ingested indiscriminately by both phagocytes and digestive gland cells.
The ultimate fate of the phagocytes was not determined. If they wander back to
rejoin the digestive gland epithelium, and thus transfer the products of digestion of the
food particles taken up, to the digestive gland cells, then it may be suggested that the
significance of the phagocytes lies merely in the fact that they form a convenient
means of extending the ingestive surface of the digestive gland into the lumen of the
midgut. The phagocytes are not comparable with those described by YoncE and other
workers in the gut of lamellibranchs, since they are confined to the lumen of the
digestive gland and midgut, and not in any way connected with the blood system,
whereas the phagocytes of lamellibranchs wander freely in and out of the lumen of the
gut and through all the tissues, and are essentially blood cells.

The investigation of the enzymes, though regrettably incomplete, is sufficient to
show that in accordance with the specialized diet, the enzymes of Jorunna are different
from those of typical herbivorous gastropods, such as Crepidula or Aplysia, on one
hand, and from those of typically carnivorous forms, such as Murex or Natica, on the
other.
