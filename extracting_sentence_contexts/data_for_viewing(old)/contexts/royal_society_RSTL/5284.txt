The head and wings are united with the part of the body covered by the mantle,
by a narrow neck ; compared with Zuribia, the change in form is such as would be
produced by a lateral expansion of the foot. Behind the mouth is the wide metapo-
dium, and on each side of it are the broad epipodia continuous with the metapodium,
About midway between the mouth and their margin the epipodia carry a small
triangular lobe (ms), which evidently represents one-half of the mesopodium ; and
nearly at the same leyel, on their anterior edges, they present two small curved and
pointed processes, the representatives of the large tentacles of Zuribia. Two minute
papillze, the rudiments of the eyes, are placed upon the dorsal surface just behind
the anterior edge of the alze (i).

* It is a very interesting fact that Professor Mi'LLEs has found the larvz of Pneumodermon to be provided
with similar ciliated bands, Ueber die Entwickelungs-formen, &c. Monatsbericht d. k. Akad. d, Wiss. zu
Berlin, October 1852.

+ Theze are called © branchies” by Expoux and SouLezr (pl. 15.), but why I cannot divine, since these
organs are certainly homologous with the tentacles of Cleodora.

{ Is this to be compared with the small posterior curved process of the edge of the mantle in Gasteropteron ?
