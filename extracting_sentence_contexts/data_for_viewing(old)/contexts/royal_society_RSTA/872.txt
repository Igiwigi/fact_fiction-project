impact resulting from land-use modifications in a state-of-the-art ESM.

The results displayed in figure 9 reveal again a very high impact of the land-based conditions
on temperature extremes (TXx) in two regions with particularly strong warming of hot extremes
(figure 5), Central Europe (CEU) and Central North America (CNA). Consistent with the results
from Vogel et al. [14] which suggest that much of the amplified warming of hot extremes is due to
soil moisture feedbacks (figure 6), the CESM simulations including irrigation (and thus reduced
soil moisture limitation) over all of the cropland area display a much reduced warming (blue line).
We note that changes in albedo are also found to have some non-negligible effect on hot extremes,
in particular for albedo increases of 0.1, consistent with other analyses [45,47]. Nonetheless, their
effect appears smaller than that of irrigation in the considered (idealized) experiment.

An important feature also highlighted in Hirsch et al. [15] is the fact that the total effect of
irrigation or albedo on the regional temperatures is found to be almost independent of the level
of global warming (close to constant offset from the line for the CTL experiment; figure 9). This
