Outlook 3

In this article, we have derived a better approximation for the MDLG equilibrium distribution :s
function. It deviates from the previous best approximation by Parsa et al. [1] in a broad transition [2
region between the ballistic and diffusive regime of random particle displacements. Despite the fact that these deviations are small, we expect them to be of great importance in
the analysis of non-equilibrium systems, particularly systems not too far from equilibrium, as
is typical in hydrodynamic systems. What we have outlined here is the equilibrium behaviour
of the MDLG mapping of an MD simulation onto an LG. The key interest, however, lies in
the non-equilibrium predictions of this mapping.
