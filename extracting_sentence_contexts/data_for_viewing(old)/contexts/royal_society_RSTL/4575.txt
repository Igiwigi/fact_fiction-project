Dr. Rosixsox, in his article on the strength of materials*, when discussing the na-
ture of a stretching force applied to materials, obseryes, © that in pulling a body
asunder the force of cohesion is directly opposed with very little modification of its
action ; that all parts are equally stretched, and the strain in every transverse sec-
tion is the same in every part of that section.” From this it would appear, that a
body of a homogeneous texture will have the cohesion of its parts equal, and since
every part is equally stretched, it follows that the particles will be drawn to equal
distances, and the forces thus exerted must be equal. Now if this were trae, the ap-
plication of an external force to a body might be increased to such an extent as not
only to separate the parts furthest asunder, but ultimately to destroy the cohesion of
all the particles at once, a circumstance under which instantaneous rupture would
follow as a result. These views are however not borne out by facts, as the experi-
ments of Mr. HopcexixsoNn on iron wire show that the same iron may be torn asun-
der many times in succession without impairing its strength+; and some recent expe-
riments at the Royal Dockyard, Woolwich, clearly show, that an iron bar may be
stretched until its transverse section is considerably reduced and ultimately broken
without injury to its tensile strength. Nay, more, the same iron (8 elongated), when
again snbmitted to experiment, exhibited increased strength, and continued to in-
crease, under certain limitations, beyond the bearing powers of the same bar in its
original form4F. That all the parts of a body * subjected to a tensile strain are equally
stretched ” is therefore questionable. Bodies yary considerably in their powers of re-
sistance, and exhibit peculiar properties of cohesion under the influence of forces cal-
culated to tear them asunder. Fibrous substances, for instance, such as ropes and
some kinds of timber having their fibres twisted, are enabled to resist tension under
