structure [20,21]. It is also possible to estimate nonlinear models, in which case non-Gaussianity
may no longer be necessary [22,23]. As already mentioned, cyclic models can be estimated,
replacing the acyclicity assumption by a weaker one [14,17].


Figure 2. An example of a causal network between the variables x; that can be estimated with LiINGAM. The non-zero bjâ€™s are :&
shown as arrows from x; to.x;, with numerical values attached to them. The network is acyclic, which is seen in the fact that after
a suitable reordering of the variables (which has been done here), all the arrows go down.

4. Testing of independent components

After estimating ICA, it would be very useful to assess the reliability or statistical significance of
the components. In fact, in the literature, independent components estimated from various kinds
of scientific data are often reported without any kind of validation, which seems to be against the
basic principles of scientific publication.

The classical validation of estimation results is statistical significance (also called reliability),
which assesses if it is likely that the results could be obtained by chance. In the context of ICA,
we would like to be able to say if a component could be obtained, for example, by inputting just
pure noise to an ICA algorithm.

An additional problem that we encounter with computationally intensive and complex
estimation methods is what we could call computational reliability. Even if the data were perfect
and sufficient for any statistical inference, the computational algorithm may get stuck in bad local
optima or otherwise fail to produce meaningful results. Most ICA algorithms are based on local
