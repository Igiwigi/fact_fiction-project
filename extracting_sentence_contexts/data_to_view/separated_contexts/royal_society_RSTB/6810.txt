But de Beer (1937) says:

The attempt might be made to define a bone according to embryological criteria as the
product of a single embryonic centre of ossification, but this leads into serious difficulties. In
the first place, many single bones may arise from more than one centre of ossification.

* de Beer (1937, p. 494) says: “It is to be concluded from this discussion, therefore, that while
morphological relations between different structures are remarkably constant, this constancy must not
be taken as implying a hard and fast rule.”


ON THE EVOLUTION OF THE MAMMALIAN PALATE 319

and

The parietal in Man must, therefore, be regarded as affording evidence of the sub-division
of an originally single bone, further examples of which are provided by the squamosal, tympanic,
malleus, stapes, and certain Wormian ossifications in Man, or the suborbital and opercular
ossicles in Lepidosteus.

and again

In other words, it is not possible to arrive at a satisfactory definition of what constitutes a bone along
embryological lines, in terms of separate centres of ossification. (Italics de Beer’s.)

It is clear therefore that there are no reliable grounds on which the independence
of the palatine processes in mammals can be asserted. Again, in early papers much weight was placed on the fact that the vomer of
Ornithorhynchus ossified from a single centre by comparing it with typical parasphenoids. The use of this argument was destroyed utterly when it was shown that the vomer
of the allied Echidna ossified from two centres, particularly since this occurs also in
other mammals (man, pig). Yet the argument has since been reversed and a double
origin used as evidence in favour of the prevomer-vomer homology.
