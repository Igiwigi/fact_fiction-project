part of the root which represents flexion of the wrist, and a bundle in another part
of the root which represents extension of the wrist.

It is clear that examination of the fore-limb does not, any more than did that of
the hind-limb,t support W. Krause’s§ statement that the skin at the free end of the
limb is innervated by the nerve-fibres which, among fibres for the limb, are the ones
most segmentally posterior; that opinion is clearly no longer tenable. Krauser,
from his experiments and dissections on Lepus and Cynomolgus, also supported the
“law” of VANDERKOLK|| and Hirron,{ to wit, that a muscle is supplied with nerve-
fibres by the same spinal nerve as innervates the skin overlying it. In this again
Kravsz is as directly controverted by examination of the fore-limb as of the hind.
Also, in speaking of the longest nerve-fibres, as those in the VIIIth cervical root,
Krause must be ignorant of the fact that the Ist and [Ind thoracic roots send nerve
fibres to the intrinsic muscles of the hand.

SECTION IV.—SPINAL REFLEX ACTION.

The above examination of the peripheral distribution of the roots of the spinal
nerves was undertaken “as a step preliminary to observations on the reflex functions
of the spinal cord.”**

Methods Employed.

For the purpose in view I found it essential to transect the cord; for the hind-limb
region this was done sometimes at low levels, more usually above the Ist cervical
