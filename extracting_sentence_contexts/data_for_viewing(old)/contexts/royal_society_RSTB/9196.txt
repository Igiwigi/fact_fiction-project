growth restriction begins. Other measures more likely reflect-
ing chronic conditions in utero suggest that the fetus is more
hypoxic at high than low altitude insofar as high- compared
with low-altitude newborns have higher haemoglobin, haema-
tocrit and erythropoietin levels [21,71]. Such changes are less
pronounced in Andeans versus Europeans at high altitude
[21,71,72], with ancestry-group differences in fetal head cir-
cumference (HC) and femur length (FL) already present by
week 20 [66].

Doppler indices have been shown in recent years to be a
valuable means for assessing fetal hypoxia [73,74]. Their utility
stems from the fact that fetal hypoxia prompts cerebral vasodi-
lation that, in turn, redistributes cardiac output to favour the
brain and other vital organs (‘brain sparing’), directs blood
flow away from other organs and hence slows fetal growth.
Such changes are demonstrated by an increased UmbA
pulsatility index (PI), measured as the rise in blood velocity
during systole weighted by the average velocity throughout
the cardiac cycle and which likely indicates a rise in systemic
vascular resistance; a decreased middle cerebral artery
(MCA) PI, rise in MCA peak systolic velocity (PSV) and/or a
greater decrease in the MCA than UmbA PI (i.e. a decreased
MCA/UmbA PI ratio) that are indicative of cerebral vasodila-
tion [73,74]. We therefore asked whether high altitude alone
