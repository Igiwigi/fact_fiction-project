Now, the
main result of this will be that as long as the body is being thrown out, the region between
the oral cone and the adductor muscle will be squeezed out of existence, and in this region
is the blood pump. Thus, one piece of morphological evidence—the arrangement of the
dorsal longitudinal muscles—suggests that the blood pump will be filled, while another,
the disposition of the attrahens muscle, indicates that it will be emptied at the beginning
of the casting movement. What actually happens can, I think, be deduced from the fact
that in a barnacle, when casting commences, it is not the body that is extruded first of all,
but the cirri. Now the cirri are extruded by being distended, and this distension is an
erection brought about by the contraction of the dorsal longitudinal series. We can
conclude, therefore, that at the commencement of each cast of the body the dorsal muscles
contract first and so distend, not only the cirri, but the blood pump.
