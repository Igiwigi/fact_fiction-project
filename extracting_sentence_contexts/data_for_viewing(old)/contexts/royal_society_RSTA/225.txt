albumin membranes. Parkinson et al. (2009) utilized a nanoporous alumina
template in order to create nanoporous membranes for fibroblast growth. Dermal
fibroblasts and epidermal keratinocytes were shown to adhere to these nanoporous
membranes as well as migrate across membrane surfaces. Graham et al. (2009)
recently suggested that nanoporous alumina electrodes may be used as an
interface with neuronal cells; an in vitro assay involving mouse neuroblastoma x
rat glioma hybrid cells demonstrated the biocompatibility of nanoporous alumina.
The use of nanoporous alumina membranes for environmental applications has
also received recent interest. For example, Ma, B. et al. (2009) suggested the use
of nanoporous membranes for water purification.

As mentioned earlier, many medical and environmental applications for
nanoporous alumina membranes are attributed to the fact that these materials
exhibit high pore densities, well-controlled and uniform pore sizes, as well as
straight pores. Transport of materials across nanoporous membranes may be
controlled by altering the membrane pore size in a controlled manner. In addition,
nanoporous materials with unusual biological and chemical properties may be
created by chemically modifying the pore surface. For example, Xiong et al.
(2005) pointed out that impurities incorporated within nanoporous alumina
membranes during the synthesis of these structures could have a significant
influence on the chemical properties of the membranes. In addition, it is
currently unknown whether aluminium is a biocompatible material; for example,
Hegde et al. (2003) suggested that aluminium ingestion is associated with
the development of amyloid plaques. Atomic layer deposition may be used to
decrease the sizes of the pores while retaining a narrow pore distribution. In
