Control of rhythmic limb movements in both vertebrates and invertebrates
is determined by neuronal networks termed central pattern generators (CPG),
where motor feedback is not required [4]. Indeed, CPGs in in vitro preparations
can produce activity patterns that are identifiable with the in vivo behaviour. For instance, in the pteropod Clione limacine (sea butterfly), which swims
with two dorsal wings, the neuronal pattern for basic synchronous movement
(fictive swimming) can be reproduced in isolated pedal ganglia [5]. A striking
example of the genetic basis of gait-control and CPGs pertains to the Icelandic
horse, where the ability to pace (legs on the same side of the body moving
synchronously) was shown to be associated with a point mutation [6]. At the microscale, organisms interact with their world following very differ-
ent physical principles.
