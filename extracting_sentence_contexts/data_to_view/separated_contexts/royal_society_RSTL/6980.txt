But here it may be objected, with ſome appear-
ance of reaſon, that there /is a warm fluid, the liv-
ing blood, in every part of the fleſhy ſubſtance of
all the muſcles, during the life of the animals;
and yet it is a fat, that no muſcle of voluntary
motion contra&ts, but at the command of the will,
morbid caſes excepted. This obje&tion comes cloſe
to the original queſtion, and however reaſonable
- it may ſeem, will quickly vaniſh before ſome com-
mon obſervations concerning the objects of ſenſe in
general, and their manner of operating upon the
different organs, ſo far as it univerlally agrees,

We muſt firſt beg leave to make an caſy poſtula-
tum, 72. that the nerves are the immediate inftru-
ments of ſenſation, though they are differently or-
ganized for the different ſenſes. Obſervations, proving that the ſenſations of which we
take cognizance are merely relative,

It is a certain fact, that, in the ſeveral ſenſes, the
proper objects being ſuppoſe preſent, the ſenſation is
intirely relative ; or, in other words, that the preſence
of a powerful obje& always obliterates the preſent
ſenſation of a weak: object ; and that the conſtant ha-
bitual preſence of any one object, in the ſame given
degree, produces no ſenfation at all. Thus we obſerve, that the light of the ſun extin-
guiſhes the light of the ſtars; a ftronger taſte covers a
weaker; the ſound of a drum drowns an ordinary
human voice; itching is baniſhed by ſmart and pain;
a weak ſcent, by one that is ſtrong ; cold, or a leſs
degree of- warmth, by heat, or a. greater degree of
warmth; and univerſally, our daily experience de-
monlſtrates. to us, that. every organ of ſenſe, made
familiar to a given degree of its object, affords no
manner of ſenſation of the obje&tin the given.degree. Thus it fares with the warm blood, which has
conſtantly flowed through the whole minute ſub-
ſtance ofeverymuſcle of voluntary motionin ananimal
body, from the time of their formation, or unfold-
ing in the womb.
