It would appear probable that, whilst a geological change is taking place, the earth
is practically rigid for long periods. But as the earth comes to depart more and more
from a form of equilibrium, the stresses due to the mutual gravitation of the parts, and
to the rotation, increase gradually, until they are sufficiently great to cause the s8olid
matter to flow. A rough kind of adjustment to a form of equilibrium would then take
place. The existence of continents, however, shows that this adjustment does not take
place by the subsidence of the upheaved part; and as this adaptation of form would
be produced by an entirely different cause from that to which the upheaval was due, that
upheaval would probably persist independently of the approximate adoption of a new
form of equilibrium by the earth.

M. Taesca's experiments on the punching of metals would lead one to believe that
the change would take place somewhat 8nddenly, and would, in fact, be by an earth-
quake, or a succession of earthquakes. On each of these occasions the tendency would

® In his Address to the British Association, 1876, he states that the argument derived from precession
(Tnons0x and Tarr's Nat. Phil. p. 691) is fallacious ; he adduces, however, a number of cogent arguments on
this point.
