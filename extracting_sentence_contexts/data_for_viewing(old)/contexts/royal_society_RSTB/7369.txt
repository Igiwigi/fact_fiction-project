t The ester-wax embedding technique (Steedman 1947) which should lend itself well to the cutting of
calcified tissues came to my notice after the bulk of the material had been sectioned and has not been tried.


OF ASTROPECTEN IRREGULARIS (PENNANT) 525

of 54 to 60Â° C wax with 1 % of ceresin added. Although the calcareous ossicles of the arms
felt stony to the touch the great majority of the blocks cut perfectly well on a Cambridge
Rocker microtome providing that the sections were not less than 20y thick and that the
knife was restropped after every fifth or, at the most, tenth section. Sections were usually
cut at 40 to 504. Thick sections have the great advantage over thin ones of rendering the
pattern of cell bodies and the course of their fibres relatively easy of reconstruction. It was,
in fact, found impossible in thinner sections to be sure of the identity of any one fibre within
a complex when attempting to trace its course from one section to another. Occasionally,
for the purpose of checking the reconstructions from 40 to 50 sections, blocks were cut
into 100, slices. This can be done on a Rocker microtome if a bunsen burner is placed close
to the block in order to soften it and so prevent cracking and curling of the wax.

Counterstaining

Serial sections were usually mounted in balsam without previous counterstaining. Some
few slides, however, were counterstained with 1 % eosin or 0-5 % orange G in 90 % alcohol.
No perceptible fading of any of the permanently mounted sections has yet been observed,
though many of the preparations are at the time of writing more than two years old.
