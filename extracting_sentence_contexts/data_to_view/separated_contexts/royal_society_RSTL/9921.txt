It is not due to temperature. This
reduces the cause for the different values of to the irregularity in the pipes owing
to joints and other causes, and the nature of the surfaces. The effect of the joints on the values of 7 seems to be proved by the fact that
Danov's three lead pipes gave slightly different values for n, while my two pipes
without joints gave exactly the same value, which is slightly less than that obtained
from Darcy's experiments.

Darcy's pipes were all of them uneven between the gauge points, the glass and
the iron varying as much as 20 per cent. in section.
