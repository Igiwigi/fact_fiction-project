(6.4)
which displays a very interesting behaviour. This is plotted in figure 11, which compares the
Higgs potentials in both frames. As both the numerator and denominator in (6.4) grow like nt
at large field values, the Einstein potential develops a plateau with Vg ~ Amb /(4E?). One can
read the scale beyond which the plateau forms directly from (6.4) as h > Aine =mp/Vé. It is
clear that having a positive 4 at the high scale Ajp¢ is required for successful inflation: if the SM
potential is destabilized at (or below) Ajnr, the flattening produced by & will not help in building
an inflationary plateau, and that is the ultimate reason why, within the SM with no additional
ingredients, Higgs inflation requires that we live in the stability region of parameter space.

Assuming that this is the case, we see from figure 11 that such a plateau looks very promising
for inflation and in fact one gets a very constrained slow-roll inflationary model with a single
adjustable parameter, . In fact, € is fixed to be & ~ 10,104 in order to get the right amount
of scalar perturbations, as determined already by COBE. Once & is fixed, one can predict other
inflationary parameters [62-64,112,126], like the tensor-to-scalar ratio r~ 0.003 and the scalar
spectral index, n, ~ 0.965. These predictions fit remarkably well with the constraints from Planck
2015 and BICEP2 data, shown in figure 11b.

However, on closer inspection there are a number of problems with this scenario and the
situation is less promising that this successful prediction seems to imply. To discuss them, let
us look first in more detail at the kinetic term in the Einstein frame action of equation (6.3):
