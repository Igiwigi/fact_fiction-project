the first two architectures in table 2 do not include integrated TACs/TDCs, we report the timing
uncertainty as it is evaluated externally, using a commercial TDC, whereas timing resolution and
differential/integral nonlinearity are reported elsewhere. The overall pixel bandwidth refers to
the maximum symbol rate that the image sensor can generate per pixel (irrespective of whether
TOA is computed on- or off-chip). When TOA is computed off-chip, we assumed that processing
speed is not limited by the TAC/TDC used but by intrinsic I/O speed. This is why the design
of Niclass et al. [65] is penalized in the table with respect to the two previous designs, as the
integrated TDCs are the bottleneck. In this design in fact, only one row can be operational at each
time, whereas each four columns share a TDC. Thus, the overall TDC bandwidth of 10MSs~!
must be divided by 4 times 128, to reach the reported value.

In the design of Gersbach et al. [46], a bandwidth of 1 MS s-! in TCSPC mode can be achieved,
whereas a much higher count rate is possible, thanks to an on-pixel six-bit counter. Thus, the
maximum count rate is limited by the dead time of 100ns. The timing uniformity, wherever
measured, is expressed in % or LSB depending on the presence of TOA evaluation on-chip.
