Table 1 summarizes the
classification outlined here. Applying the framework of Dennett’s tower does raise the
interesting question of whether intelligence must necessarily
be achieved by building each level of generate-and-test on
top of the preceding one, or whether robot intelligence
might skip one or more, to achieve cumulative culture more
directly. The fact that we are able to skip the Skinnerian
level is a consequence of hard coding the capabilities sum-
marized in table 1. Strictly speaking, this is a serious break
with both the evolutionary origins and cumulative nature
of each level in Dennett’s framework. Given, however, that
artificially evolving each capability in succession is far
beyond what can be achieved in evolutionary robotics at pre-
sent [41], and that we have demonstrated the implementation
of Skinnerian learning, the break is—we believe—justified.
