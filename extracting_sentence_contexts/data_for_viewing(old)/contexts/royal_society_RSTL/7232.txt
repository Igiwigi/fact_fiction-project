we assert this identity in the chemical equation

Proceeding in other cases in a similar manner, we should arrive at a system of equa-
tions corresponding in number to the experiments of which the results were thus recorded.
It would s00n, however, be perceived that we could not in this manner indefinitely add
to our knowledge, but that the information thus supplied to us was s00n exhausted, the
equations not being independent, but capable of being derived from one another by the
processes of addition and subtraction ; and that, in fact, they could be replaced by a
8ingle system of equations connecting every chemical symbol equal in number to the
total number of chemical substances, exclusive of the elemental bodies. Such a system
is afforded to us by those equations which expres the relations of identity which subsist
between the ponderable matter of compound substances and the ponderable matter of
the elemental bodies of which they are composed, which we may consider as a solution
of the entire system of chemical equations in regard to the symbols of the elements.
From this primary system every other chemical equation may be derived, and our total
