by Penfield [6]. The right side displays the classical homunculus
he constructed from these data.

Figure 1a investigates the claim that an ordered somato-
topy exist for the fingers. Really, considering the actual
stimulation data, it seems hard to see any justification for
this hypothesis. Thumb contractions (coloured in blue), for

instance, are observed along the whole extent of the central
sulcus; they are not clustered in the medio-lateral region
and do not appear to be consistently medial with respect to
the responses recorded for other fingers, including the little
one (coloured in red). In fact, rather than observing indepen-
dent contractions for each finger, Penfield reported, in most
cases, motor responses that involved all fingers together
without individual segregation (black dots). Recently, this
combined activation has been reproduced in monkeys,
where microstimulation was found to trigger organized pat-
terns of finger synergies [60]. Also, data gathered in these
animals have clearly challenged the idea of a sequential rep-
resentation of each individual finger along a medio-lateral
axis going from the little finger to the thumb [49,61].
