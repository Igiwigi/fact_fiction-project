To ee if thj
is the case I have figured the spectrum of chlorofucin in the natural condition j
PFucus 8erratus and in alcoholic solution, and on comparizon of these spectra with
those of the above-mentioned Actiniz a remarkable likeness is apparent. (See
spectra 8 and 9, Chart II.) : I

As I have already shown, the conclusion of KrUkexBERG®* that the colouring
matter of the yellow cells of Anthea cereus is identical with that of the hepato-
chromates (= enterochlorophyll) is not borne out by this fact ; viz., that in the
ease of enterochlorophyll no such change is produced by caustic alkalies as is produced
in solutions of the colouring matter of the © yellow cells” with these reagents. Auother very remarkable fact noticed should go to support the view of the © yellow
cells” being symbiotic algae, namely, that they appear to cause a suppression of thoge
pigments which in other Actiniaz appear to discharge a respiratory function. In most,
if nob in all cases, this fact impressed itself strongly on my attention, and I believe
the observation is correct. At the 8ame time we must remember that the © yellow
cells ”—if they are 8ymbiotic algazz—only give oxygen up to the tissues of the animal,
which would still require to be ized in the tissues by a combination with something
else, such as actiniohzmatin or other pigments ; s0 that too much importance ought
not to be attached to the apparent absence or presence of such pigments in the
ectoderm, endoderm, or other parts. Their absence too ought nob to be concluded
from the mere fact that they cannot be detected in certain solutions of these
parts, as there is no doubt that they cannot always be got into such solutions even
when present.
