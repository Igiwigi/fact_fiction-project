H. Munk has expressed
the opinion that impulses for touch irradiate easier in a direction from hind-limb to
fore- limb, while impulses for common sensation easier in a direction from fore-limb
Bo hind-limb, My own experience is consentient in traversing this fourth law
Gof Priiicer. It is well, therefore, while recording the fact, to note that after high
ransection of the cord, reflexes from the fore-limbs are usually not on the whole so
Afreely evoked as from the hind-limbs and tail. It has often seemed that the motor
neurons high up, and therefore nearer the transection, are less receptive of impulses,
and are partially blocked or under “ shock,” especially for impulses arriving at them
from sources outside their own local region. Observations on the knee-jerk indicate||
that, in the neighbourhood of a spinal transection, the short local reflex path and
