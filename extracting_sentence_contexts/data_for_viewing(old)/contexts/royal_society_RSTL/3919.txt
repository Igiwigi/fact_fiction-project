In many apparently simple reactions it is difficult to ascertain with certainty all
the combinations and decompositions which occur, and our thermal results become
proportionally difficult to interpret. Even to deduce the heat due to the combina-
tion of an anhydrous acid and alkali from that evolved when their solutions are

mixed together, is a question of yery great difficulty, requiring the previous determi-
nation of many data, all of which are in few instances capable of being discovered by
experiment. The liquids before mixture are, in fact, solutions of the acid and alkali
in the state of hydrates, and as large quantities of heat were evolyed during the
formation of these hydrates, and generally also during their subsequent solation, an
equal absorption of heat, will take place when these combinations are destroyed. A
further allowance is also required for the effect of the solution of the resulting com-
pound. After making all these corrections it is doubtful whether the result finally
obtained would not be a theoretical or imaginary number.

If we adopt the view, now generally admitted by chemists, that the hydrated acids
are in reality compounds of the pure acids with water performing the functions of a
base, the heat produced when a dilute acid is neutralized by a base will arise from
the latter displacing an equivalent of basic water*, and the general result, before re-
ferred to, may be thus expressed. Â© When the same base displaces water from any
