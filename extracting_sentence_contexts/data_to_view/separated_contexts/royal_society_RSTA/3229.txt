In addition, the growth rate parameters a > 0 and 6 <0
are determined analytically too. The present analytical approach can be easily extended to more complex phase transition
regimes in the presence of moving phase transition regions (e.g. ternary and multicomponent
systems [40]). For instance, it can be applied to ternary melts with allowance for the fact that the
temperature relaxation time is much smaller than the corresponding relaxation times of solute
impurities. The theory under consideration can also be used to describe the non-equilibrium
