However, there is no guarantee that a to control homunculi or black boxes [54]. While this is true,

valid and robust test of an ability will yield individual vari- identifying such latent variable structure might serve as an

ation in that ability across individuals, which is needed for intermediary step towards a more mechanistic model of EF

Steps 2 and 3. In fact, the most robust tests may not translate [68]. Breaking down EF into its fundamental components

into reliable measures of individual differences precisely will probably require iterative applications of the multi-trait

because they tend to be associated with small between- multi-method approach. Conversely, inspiration for task
