Thus the condition for the absence of the source-term is

and the effective inertia of the ship (S being zero) is

The values of the parameters must of course be such that c > k >—e, and it is clear
that there is a wide range of values of a, p, g, and \ which permit of this being true. It may be well, in connexion with (44), to recall the fact that ¢ is of the dimensions
of a length multiplied by a velocity, and that for a given configuration in the z plane
c[V is independent of V. Though the formula (44) does actually contain the law of the dependence of the
inertia of the ship (having a certain type of shape) upon the angles 2p7 and 2qz7 at
bow and stern, it must not be assumed that the functional law corresponds to the
explicit appearance of p and q in the formula. The other parameters are to be
regarded not as data, but as functions of what ought properly to be the data, for
example the length and breadth or the length and area of the ship.
