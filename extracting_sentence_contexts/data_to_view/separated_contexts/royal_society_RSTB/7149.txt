As
regards the effect of a subcutaneous graft on a subsequent graft to the anterior chamber no
other explanation seems possible. As regards the effect on an anterior chamber graft of a
simultaneous subcutaneous graft in experiment II, 2 (i), it was at first thought that this
might be explained by supposing that the latter actively functioned for a short time and
thereby adversely affected the former in accordance with Halstedâ€™s principle. This
hypothesis appeared to gain some support from the fact that the effect of a simultaneous
homograft on an anterior chamber graft from the same donor was much the same whether
the recipient was subjected to total or to subtotal thyroidectomy (cf. experiments II,
1 (ii) (a) and II, 1 (ii) (b)), but would appear to be ruled out by the following
considerations:

First, in experiment II, 1 (i), when simultaneous subcutaneous and anterior chamber
autografts were made, after total thyroidectomy, the anterior chamber graft was successful
in five out of six cases, despite the survival of the subcutaneous graft in every case, whereas
uncomplicated autografts to the anterior chamber following hemi-thyroidectomy succeeded
in only 4 out of 9 cases. Secondly, in experiment II, 1 (iii), where simultaneous subcutaneous and anterior
chamber grafts were made from different donors, the subcutaneous graft had no significant
effect on the chances of survival of the graft in the anterior chamber. It will be seen that the proportion of surviving anterior chamber homografts occurring
when either a preceding or a simultaneous subcutaneous homograft was made was some-
what less when the two grafts were from the same donor than when they were taken from
different donors, but the difference is much too small to be accepted as statistically
significant.
