curve for the spectral colours would show two troughs: one in the yellow, the other in the
blue. The yellow one, as pointed out in the next section, is, in the authorâ€™s view, shown in
the curves obtained by Wright for a small foveal area. The deficiency in the blue is also
shown, but not so clearly.

With a further reduction of visual angle, other changes take place, causing red to be
replaced by dark grey or by black, and blue-green to change to pale grey or white. The
alteration to the red might be brought about by severing the red nerve path in the same
manner as has already been supposed to have occurred to the blue and the yellow. The
modification of blue-green to white is obviously of a different nature. One suggestion is
that in some way, at present unknown, the blue-green receptors have become altered into

dominators. The fact that the latter were found by Granit to have response curves extending

over nearly the whole of the visible spectrum, does not prove that when stimulated they
would cause a sensation of white to be perceived, but that seems to be a justifiable supposi-
tion, for dominators would be expected to give a colourless sensation, just as the rods do in
twilight vision. A possible alternative view is that the blue-green receptors give a colourless
sensation, not by their conversion into dominators, but by their being linked with the other
colour centres in the brain: either the red one only, or more probably the red, yellow and
blue. It should not be difficult to decide which of these two alternative schemes is correct,
