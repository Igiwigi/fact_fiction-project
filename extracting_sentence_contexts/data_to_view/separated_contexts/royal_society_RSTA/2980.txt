Such formulation covers all possible instances of the
notion, and corresponds to setting up a partial ordering among events, thus requiring a network
description, which is embedded in the operational framework. The OPT formulation is perfectly
compliant with the historical philosophical concept of causality since David Hume, along
with its usage in common reasoning, inference and modelling in sciences [19]. From its OPT
formulation, we can also appreciate that, being an ingredient of a probabilistic logical inference
approach, causality is a genuinely theoretical notion, and this simple fact closes all debates
about ‘objective’ identification of causes versus effects without assuming the arrow of time, as
in the case of the Phil Dowe analysis [3] of Wesley Salmon attempts [1,2]. Even the same issue
of Hume’s induction corresponds to such misinterpretation of causality as an objective notion,

5The misidentification of the two notions of ‘causality’ and ‘determinism’ is hidden ubiquitously in the literature. For
example, it is the reason why the de Broglie-Bohm pilot-wave theory is also called causal interpretation of quantum mechanics.
