For process B greater deactivation cross-sections are required even if allowance is made
for the possibility that several vibration levels of the O; complex may contribute. The
collision cross-section for deactivation of the complex must be some 10* times the gas
kinetic or the radiative lifetime less than 107!Â° sec.

The reason for the large collision deactivation rate is far from clear. For the Bloch-
Bradbury process or for our suggestion (II) a large quantum of vibrational energy must be
transferred. This cannot easily take place directly, as noted earlier, and it seems unlikely
that the effective cross

section for the indirect process (35), involving electron transfer, can
greatly exceed the gas-kinetic value. Although near-resonance conditions prevail, the fact
that the transfer can only proceed through coupling between electronic and vibrational
motion must certainly tend to reduce the probability. Again, for our suggestion (1) for
process A, the stabilization involves transfer of small quanta of vibrational energy from a
molecule in a highly excited vibrational state. Although such energy is readily transformed
into translational energy on collision, the effective collision radius is not likely to be much
greater than the extreme nuclear separation in the excited molecule. That this is as large as
3 x 1077 cm. seems most improbable.
