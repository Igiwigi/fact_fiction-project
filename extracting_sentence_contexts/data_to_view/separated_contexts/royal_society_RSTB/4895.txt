All the oocytes present in the ovary at this time enter upon this
phase of development. It will be seen also that in the older ovaries the smallest oocytes
found do not vary much in size, although a slight but definite increase is to be observed
in the minimum size in successive stages. In fact the smallest oocytes of the laying
hen are only one-half as large again in diameter as the smallest in the 3 weeks chick. It is obvious, therefore, that many of the oocytes remain throughout the development
of the fowl, and even for some time after sexual maturity, at almost the same size as
they had attained in the ovary of the 3 weeks old chick at the close of the extra-follicular
growth period. Others, however, appear to grow more rapidly, as is shown by the
maximum measurements for the 3, 6, and 11 weeks chicks.
