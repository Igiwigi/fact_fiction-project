Stwo minutes 83:2 parts, and 80 on. Throughout the middle part of the course of this
Zexperiment, from the end of the fourth to the end at any rate of the tenth minute of its
= progres, a relation exists between the corresponding numbers in the first and 8econd
© columns which strikes the eye at once. Their product is a constant quantity. The
S divergence of the results for the fifteenth and seventeenth minutes is probably due to an
= experimental error, committed either in determining the rather small amount of residue,
A or in the measurement of the proportional quantities of the two principal reagents ; such
an error would affect chiefly the later stages of the experiment, the ratio of the two
substances which should be constant changing slowly at first and afterwards more rapidly.
But the divergence of the result in the earlier part of the experiment is much more
considerable, and shows unmistakeably that, until the reaction has advanced a certain
distance, it does not follow the hyperbola which correctly represents the remainder of its
course. The same fact, it will be seen, reappears in every similar series of experiments.
Its cause was for a long time obscure, and the authors were driven to discard this rela-
tion, which appeared only to hold good for part of their results, and to be inconsistent
with others of equal authority. Later experiments, however, have established the reality
of this relation, and led to the discovery of the cause of divergence.

It will be scen that after six minutes the residues still unreduced are inyersely propor-
tional to the time during which the action has continued. In the earlier stages of the
reaction its rate follows a less simple law, probably for the reason already stated—the
