The true model is integrated over approximately 62 years after a spinup of 30000 years, in the
same configuration as in [35]. In all experiments with MAOOAM, the state is fully observed every
27h (At = 27h) (corresponding to N, = 1,000). A small modification was made to the observations
from equation (2.8) to account for the fact that observations of the ocean are not at the same
scale as those of the atmosphere: before being assimilated, instantaneous ocean observations
are averaged over a 55-day rolling period centred at the analysis times. The EnKF-N is used
as DA algorithm. The noise on the model forecast is added only to the atmospheric variables
with a standard deviation of ¢™ = 1073 oft.
