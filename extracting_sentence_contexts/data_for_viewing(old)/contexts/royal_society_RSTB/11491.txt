documented were all interpreted as sporophytes. These were
small with simple bifurcating axes and most were leafless
and rootless (figure 4). Axes in contact with the ground were
rhizomatous or bulbous bearing rhizoids. Direct evidence for
gametophytes was lacking. Reflecting on this, Kidston &
Lang [59] and later Bower [33] concluded that the absence of
evidence of gametophytes implied that they must have been
even simpler and less robust than the sporophytes. Others dis-
agreed. One influential alternative interpretation held that the
rhizomes were in fact gametophytes from which upright
aerial sporophytes developed [60]; however, key evidence for
the gametophytic status was disputed [61,62]. Although this
interpretation did not receive universal acceptance, it drew
attention to the possibility that the two phases of the life
cycle might have strongly resembled one another.
