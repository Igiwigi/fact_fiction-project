images, 590 ms exposure time for each projection image which was averaged four times, detector
dimensions 2000 x 1048 pixels). The standard Feldkamp-Davis-Kress (FDK) reconstruction
algorithm was used to generate cross-sectional images by means of the NRECON software
package (SkyScan, Belgium). Images were compensated for misalignment, ring artefacts and
beam hardening during reconstruction of images. To compensate for possible misalignments in
the scan, the offset between the 0° and the 180° side projections was calculated automatically by
NRECON software and an optimal overlay between the two projections was obtained prior to
reconstruction. Ring artefacts, which may appear as a result of imperfections in the detector and
cause concentric rings superimposed on the image, were minimized by randomly moving the
object by a few micrometres throughout scanning [29] and by setting the ring artefact correction
equal to 5 (as automatically set by the NRECON software) in the reconstruction process. To correct
for beam hardening—which is a result of preferential absorption of low-energy X-rays on the
surfaces of bone, leaving the inner portions apparently less dense owing to the fact that the
remaining high-energy X-rays are absorbed less—the NRECON software applies mathematical
corrections as documented in [30,31]. In this study, beam hardening was reduced both during
the scans by using an aluminium filter and in the tomogram reconstruction by setting a constant
beam hardening correction factor of 25% in the NRECON software.
