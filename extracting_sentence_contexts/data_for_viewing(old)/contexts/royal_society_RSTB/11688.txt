gut wall—is present at the earliest stages of gut develop-
ment in the embryo; it only involves muscle cells as ICCs
are not yet differentiated at E6—E8 [29] and I found this
reflex to be resistant to tetrodotoxin, a potent neuronal
inhibitor. Pinching the embryonic gut led to the symmetric
nucleation of two waves travelling away from the point
where pressure was applied. Further development of a

tensile pre-stress of muscle fibres did not affect longitudinal
wave propagation speed or frequency (figure 5). This suggests
that mechanical cues do not play a central role in the propa-
gation mechanism of early gut contractile waves. This
conclusion is further supported by the fact that softening of
the gut by collagenase led to an increase in wave velocity
(figure 4d), contrary to what is predicted by mechanical
models of wave propagation in biological tissues [8].
