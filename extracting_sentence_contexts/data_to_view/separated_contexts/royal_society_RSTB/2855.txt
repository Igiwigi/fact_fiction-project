There was extensive clotting
in the portal veins, pulmonary arteries and systemic veins, as well as some in the
right heart. Here the slow steady failure of the circulation was doubtless due to
intravascular clotting, which would have taken place in a few seconds with the dose
used, but for the first subcutaneous injection of venom. The absence of any sudden
fall of blood pressure and the continuation of the pulse after this large intravenous
dose shows that the venom does not produce the falls always caused by it when the
cord is intact by direct action on the heart, and the fact that the production of vaso-
dilatation by section of the cord prevents any sudden marked fall of pressure due to
the intravenous injection of the venom indicates that its action is one of paralysing
the central vaso-motor centre in the medulla, and not a direct one on the heart.

If this is the case, then section of the cord after a very marked fall of pressure
produced by Daboia poison should not cause any further very marked fall of
pressure.
