and let W%(x) and W"(x) denote, respectively, the stable and unstable manifolds of (u,v)' =
0 associated with (5.6). We assume that (y*(x), ge (x)) is the unique solution, up to spatial
translation, contained in the intersection W5(x) N W"(x).

Remark 5.3. As we assume that y*(x) is a pulse solution to (5.1), dim(W%(x) N W"(x)) = 1. The
assumption that this dimension is exactly equal to one is generic for the following reason. We
append the x direction so that the manifolds W*(x) and W"(x) are n + 1-dimensional manifolds
in a 2n + 1-dimensional ambient space. Then it is a well-known fact of differential topology that


the dimension of a transverse intersection of two manifolds X and Z in the ambient space Y is
given by
dim(X N Z) = dim(X) + dim(Z) — dim(Y)
(cf. [35, p. 30]) which in our case gives
dim(W9(x) N W"(x)) = (1 + 1) + (n +1) — (2n +1) =1.

The even symmetry of g*(x) is a straightforward consequence of hypothesis 5.2 and the spatial
reversibility of (5.1).

Proposition 5.4. Assume hypothesis 5.2. Then there exists some xo € R so that g*(x) is even-symmetric
