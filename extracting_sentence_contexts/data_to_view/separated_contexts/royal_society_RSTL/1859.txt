'THE $hells of Mollusca appear to be coeyal with the first formation of the
animal: they may be obseryed covering the embryo on its first development
in the egg, even before it has acquired its proper Shape or any of its internal
organs. The accurate Swammerpan observed them in the eggs of seyeral of
the garden and pond snails. His observations have been recently verified and
extended by Prrz1rrgn, on many species of land and fresh-water Mollusca; and
I have myself observed the same fact in the eggs of several animals belonging
to the different orders of marine $hells: there is reason, therefore, to believe
that this cireumstance is general throughout the class. These observations
are most easily made on the embryo of the fresh-water shells, 8uch as the
Lymnew, Phys, Ancyli, and Bithynic, the eggs of these animals being co-
yered with a transparent coat; while the viviparous Mollusca, and especially
the Littorine, Paludine, and Cyclades *, offer the additional advantage of ex-
hibiting the embryos of their animals in all the different states of develop-
ment at the same time. The cephalopodous Mollusca form no exception ; their bone, composed of

* Between the laminz of the branchize of the Anodontes and Uniones are found small cordate,
bivalve bodies, which have been considered as their young ; but they differ s0 much in external
form and internal structure from the adults, that many excellent naturalists, and especially Professor
Jaconsox, of Copenhagen, have considered them as parasites, It is, however, remarkable that they
are found in abundance in almost every specimen, and Pyzyyrs has apparently proved that they are
the young, he having found them constituting the umbones of very minute Uniones.
