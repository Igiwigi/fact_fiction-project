That the erystals, as seen under the microscope, are thin hexagonal plates suggests
a basal cleavage with little or no molecular overlapping in the screw. As a matter of
fact, such an arrangement would explain, too, the main features of the powder photograph,
such as the absence of (100) and the great intensity of (120). It would involve a molecule
lying in the basal plane, symmetrical or pseudo-symmetrical about a dyad axis, and with
a thickness of 3-14 AU. (the spacing of (003) ) and an overall length probably equal to
that of the a-axis, 9-4 A.U.
