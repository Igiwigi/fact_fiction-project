I recall that, considering the several partial branches which meet ab a singular
point, M denotes the 8um of the number of the intersectiovs of each partial branch
by every other partial branch (s that for each pair of partial branches the inter-
sections are to be counted twice). Supposing that the tangent is z=0, and that for any
two branches we have 2; =Ajar, 2,=Agz* (where py, Py are each equal to or greater
