Significant quantities of ethanol, amounting to several tens of thousands of gallons of ethanol
can be produced in this way at prices that are already competitive. Ethanol as well as other
platform molecules, such as butanediol and isoprene can also be manufactured in massive
amounts by the fermentation of mixtures of CO2 and other gases.



Although encouraging progress has been made in producing useful materials by harnessing
solar energy in the ways described above, the scale of the operation, so far, is so small as to be
almost infinitesimal in comparison with the amounts of materials, currently produced largely
from petrochemical refining. To maintain civilized life, with all its material necessities, a massive
increase is required in the scale of production. This fact has been elaborated elsewhere [36-38]. To
gauge the magnitude of what is now required of the ‘solar refinery’, I recall that there are some
400 petrochemical refineries in use worldwide at present. A modestly sized one processes 75 000
barrels of heavy oil in its fluidized catalytic cracking (FCC) bed. For this purpose, approximately
5000 tonnes of the La+-exchanged zeolite Y cracking catalyst are cycled between the actual
‘cracking’ reactor and the regenerator per 24h. This fact alone tells us that there is an urgent
need to find new (catalytic) ‘game-changing’ ways of converting CO? to useful materials.

An important fact, commented upon at the Discussion Meeting, is that there is, at present, no
large source of readily available Hz. Were H2 plentifully available, the Fischer-Tropsch process
alone could be responsible for the production of a large selection of alkanes, alkenes and alkanols.
Indeed, the Audi Company has recently used large amounts of CO, along with H2 (produced by
electrolysis of water) to create high-quality diesel for transportation purposes.
