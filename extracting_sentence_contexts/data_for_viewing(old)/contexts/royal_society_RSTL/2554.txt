to 10—11 e.m. to be +0439, thermometer —5*58., Mr. Daimanoy, at Kotagherry,
from 9—12 p.m. to a little before sunrise, for four months, found the mean fall to
amount to 0433, and the rise from sunset to 9—12 p.m to be 0430. Mr. Prinsee,
F.R.S., in a voyage from Calcutta to Bombay, during thirty-two days found the ba-
romeler fall 0220 from 10 p.m, to sunrise, and rise 0440 from sunrise to 10 a.m. ; fall
*102 from 10 Aa.m. to 4 PM., and rise 0800 from the last hour to 10 p.m. Obserya-
tions taken hourly at the Madras Observatory, every tenth day and night, make the
night tide from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m. to amount to *035, and the 4 a.m. to 10 A.M. tide to
be -047 ; the other two tides being respectively 079 and 063. The smallness of this
maximum diurnal tide appears very anomalous, considering that Madras is in a low
latitude and at the level of the sea.

In opposition to the above facts, Dr. RussELL, at Boorhanpoor, gives a nocturnal
minimum tide with a contrary sign, or a rise instead of a Fall of +0200, between 10 p.m.
and 5 A.m.; and in observations of Dr. RoyLs, at Saharunpoor in India, at 1000
feet above the sea, and of Fray Juan, at Vera Cruz, the nocturnal tide appears
in the monthly means 8 often with a plus instead of a minus 8ign, that the annual
mean establishes this tide only by 001 at Saharunpoor, and by :002 at Vera Cruz.

Mr. Hvupsox however, at the Royal Society, in his careful hourly observations even
in the high latitude of London, found it amount to *0120 ; and I feel assured that
further observations will establish its existence at those places rendered doubtful by
