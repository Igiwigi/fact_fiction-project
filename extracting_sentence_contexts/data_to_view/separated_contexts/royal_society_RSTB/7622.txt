These three elements apply to each
individual actuary in his or her daily work but they are reinforced by our professional bodies in the code
of conduct and guidance we give our members. It is hard to think of a better example of the need to use applied science, professional judgement and
ethical standards than the subject of genetic testing. The objectives for the actuarial profession are first
to ensure that our members are as well informed as possible on the facts and the information coming
from genetic scientists and the medical profession so that they can exercise their professional judgement,
as we do in other areas, on an informed basis. The second objective is to ensure that our members
consider the ethics and fairness which insurance companies must apply, recognizing that actuaries are
in a position of considerable influence over these companies. I am not just talking here about
mathematical and actuarial fairness.
