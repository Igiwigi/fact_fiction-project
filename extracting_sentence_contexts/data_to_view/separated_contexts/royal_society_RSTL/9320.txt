Tromes0N has also obtained two branches, each of which exhibits the
Susual rows of scars, but in each specimen one Scar Supports an actual cone mn ﬆty. The
Sactual area, of attachment of each cone to its branch is a very circumscribed one, being
<=wholly different from that of a secondary to a primary branch. On the other hand,
Sthe diameter of the entire base of the cone is very considerable—corresponding, in fact,
—With that of the peripheral margin of each characteristic Ulodendroid scar. It is now
Yeasy to understand these scars. We constantly find the greater part of their surfaces
Zoovered with the modified bases of leaves.
