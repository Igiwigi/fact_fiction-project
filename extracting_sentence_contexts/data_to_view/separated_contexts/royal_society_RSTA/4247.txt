This explanation of the sharpness
of certain margins was advanced by WuetHam (loc. cit.), but bears repetition here. Tt comes to thisâ€”that the boundary will possess stability if the necessary condition
be fulfilled, but not otherwise. As a matter of fact it has been found by experiment
that the colourless SO, ion following the yellow CrO, ion through a jelly tube over-
takes it continuously, so that there is no boundary visible, but only a gradual fading
out of colour. A similar result was got also by following the blue Cu ions with
colourless Zn ions through the tube: again there was no boundary, but the colour

adually faded out. These cases probably illustrate the non-fulfilment of the con-

SHition that the foremost ion must be by nature the faster.
