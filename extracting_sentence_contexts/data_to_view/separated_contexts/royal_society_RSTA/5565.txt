There are, of course, not a few days when the giving a
“0” ora “1,” ora “1” ora “2” is very much a toss up. If the choice made one
day were to be made independently even the next week, there would be no doubt an
appreciable number of alterations in the figure ascribed, and the longer the interval
between the two choices the more would this tend to be the case. In view of this fact, in the present enquiry, the days of each year were dealt with,
so far as practicable, in immediate succession. While the standard remained, I think,
fairly uniform throughout the days of any one year, it not improbably varied sensibly
as between different years, for the time that elapsed between the consideration of the
first and last of the years was naturally considerable. In assigning the character figures the appearance of the curves was alone considered,
and the lists of the daily ranges were never consulted, so that the two lines of
investigation are at least absolutely independent.
