Its
inner radius is denoted by R,. The haloes in this Table may be described as showing
the final state of a uranium halo before every feature disappears in blackening which
extends out to the limits attained by RaC. The measurements contained in the Table are not quite so available as those
already given, on account of the fact that the correction for the nucleus must be
guess-work. I have made an allowance for it amounting to 0:0006 mm., that is I
have assumed the nuclear radius to be 0:0012 mm. Tasie TV.â€”Uranium Haloes : Final Stage.
