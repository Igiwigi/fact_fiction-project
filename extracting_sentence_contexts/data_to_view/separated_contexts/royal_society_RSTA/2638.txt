The data show that the higher the repellency (higher CA) on the flat surface, the higher
the water collection. The decreasing order of the water collection rate per unit area on flat
surfaces with homogeneous wettability is superhydrophobic surface using 10 ym, hydrophobic,
hydrophilic and superhydrophilic. This is attributed to the fact that the higher the repellency,
the more spherical the droplet shape will be, which results in a lower contact area between the
