whole, in which no part can be affected without tending more or less to influence
every other.

IN order to ascertain the seat of the power on which muscular contractility de-
pends, it was necessary in an early part of this paper to enter on the relation which
subsists between the muscular and neryous s8ystems; and it appears from what is
there said, that the nervous influence, whether in its effects on the muscles of vo-
luntary or involuntary motion, stands only in the relation of a stimulus or directly
debilitating power to the muscular fibre, according to the manner in which its organs
are impressed ; a result, I may observe in passing, peculiarly in accordance with all
the other facts which have been stated respecting the nature of that influence, because
the same observation, we shall find, applies to all the agents of inanimate nature
which are capable of influencing the muscular fibre.

The relation which next demands our attention is that which subsists between the
organs of the nervous influence and the living blood.

The first thing, which here strikes us, is that the blood-yessels and nerves uni-
formly accompany each other; from which we are led to infer that they cooperate
in functions of very general necessity.

The powers of the neryous system properly s0 called, we have seen, are all of a
chemical nature. Of this nature therefore must be all processes in which they im-
