widely different (no two, in fact, of the fifteen flint implements found there having been
met with on the same level), that it is not possible to conceive that man inhabited the
e at any time. The specimens are not numerous enough: they are found isolated
and without any corroborative adjunets.
5 Nor do we think that the flints could have been brought in by wild beasts with human
prey, fornot a fragment of a human bone was found in the cave; whereas, like with the
Snimals serving as prey, some of the remains of man in the shape of gnawed bones or
teeth must, in that case, have escaped destruction. Could the worked flints have been
| hed in, as the unworked flints doubtlessly were, with the shingle of the fourth bed
Sr with the silt of the third bed? This is possible; still we are not disposed to adopt
Hat view, inasmuch as although some of the specimens show marks of wear, that wear
FSises rather from use, and none exhibit the general wear and rounding produced by
Hanning water; the wear is, in fact, often so slight, that in the instance of the remark-
-Zble flint implement which was found broken in two pieces (p. 550), and each piece in
E] different gallery, the broken edges (ff) when brought together fitted as closely as
0 pieces of freshly broken porcelain. One fragment (No. 6) was found in the Flint-
Snife Gallery on the line of main water passage and the other (No. 8) in a different
Sirection in the Pen Gallery, s0 that their position was in all probability determined by
ertificial agency. The worked flints also in the cave-carth are to those in the shingle
the proportion of nearly 3 to 1; whereas with the unworked flints, on the contrary,
He proportions are more than reyersed, there being only 2 in the caye-earth to 5 in the
Ehingle bed, where the stream was the natural means of their introduction. The flints
& the cave-earth in No. 3 bed are in the inverse ratio in which as extraneous bodies
#ey should occur had natural agencies only been in operation.
Â© After full consideration of the subject, we can only conclude that the worked flints
