One point on the curve is evidently 0 on the scale
at 15° C. (the temperature of the room). The other two points, viz., those
corresponding to melting gold and melting AgCl, lie exactly on a straight line with
his first point. That this coincidence was not mere chance is proved by the fact
that we have calibrated three different strips—one in the first meldometer, in which
the plane of the strip was horizontal, and two in the second instrument, with the
lane of the strip vertical. The straightness of the line in each case is as perfect as
it can be drawn with a straight edge. The figures for the three strips are :
