Moreover, the supply throughout
pregnancy is so great that one cannot account for their origin in this way. It should be noticed that the destruction of the uterine epithelium is clearly due
to the actual contact of the blastocyst with the epithelium, as shown by text-
fig. 1, which, though semi-diagrammatic, is accurate as regards the position
of the contained blastocyst and the uninjured and degenerating parts of the
epithelium. The following facts may be considered established :—

(i) The uterine epithelium over certain areas, more especially over the
cotyledonary burrs, undergoes a serious amount of destruction.

(ii) A time arrives when at certain spots there is nothing that can be recognised
as an epithelium.

(iii) Over the greater part of the area where this destruction has occurred a
layer of cells takes the place of the original epithelium.

(iv) This layer of cells is quite unlike an ordinary epithelium—it is irregular—
and later becomes intimately connected by protoplasmic processes with the
subjacent tissues.

(v) This layer is subsequently added to by cells which migrate from the
trophoblast.
