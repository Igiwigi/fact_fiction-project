metal readily oxidizes in air, yet it may be kept under water, free from air, for some time
without oxidation. When, however, the wire is exposed to the air for a short time, it
loses its lustre and is 800n covered with a coating of oxide, which, as in the cases of lead
and zine, protects in a great measure the metal from further oxidation. The error caused
by the slight oxidation during the short time we were obliged to manipulate with the
wire in air may therefore be overlooked, more especially as wires of the same piece of
metal showed the same conducting-power when pressed at different times. Now, if the
slight oxidation had any marked effect, we ought to have found great differences in the
conducting-power of different wires, for it can scarcely be supposed that in all cases the
same amount of oxidation had taken place. Again, although thallium appears to be
attacked by alcohol, yet we found we might varnish the wire with a solution of shell-lac
in alcohol; for the small quantity of alcohol contained in the first coating of varnish vola-
tilizes 80 quickly that it has very little time to act on the wire; in fact the resistance of
the wire was found to be the same when determined before being varnished, and after
three or four coatings of varnish had dried on it. 'The reason of yarnishing the wire was
to protect the metal from the action of the hot oil.

The apparatus and precautions taken whilst determining the conducting-powers at
different temperatures have already been fully describedF. The normal wires used were
