Also the various terms
for the median area of the septum—primary streak, primary septum, primary spines
—are scarcely used by those authors. The particular areas in question are fitly
called in general “centres of calcification,” whether the area be seen as a “line” or a
“point” in transverse section. The “ centre of calcification” was, with those authors,
a neutral term, taking nothing for granted about the dark line (ex. Zuphyllia
Flabellum) or the dark points (ex. Mussa) themselves, but indicating merely the fact
observed that the calcareous fibres, in all cases, diverged outwards from those areas.

Both Bourne and Fow:er had abundant opportunity of confirming Koca’s state-
ment that the skeleton was entirely of ectodermal origin. At the same time, they
accepted Hrrper’s term of calicoblast for the lime-forming cells of the ectodermal
layer. They farther agreed with Koon in regarding the calicoblast as a secreting
cell, separating out the calcareous material which gave rise to the skeleton, while
itself remaining intact as an organic cell of the polypal ectoderm.
