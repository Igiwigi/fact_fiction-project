Zool. Soc. 1865, pp. T6077:

The strongest objection that seems possible to the suggestion here thrown out is in
the fact recorded by LxGvar, that the male birds of the Solitaire of Rodriguez assisted
the females in the work of incubation ; but the question of its polygamy or monogamy is
not likely to meet with a solution now. From the amount of variability which every portion of the skeleton of this species
aisplays, it may not unreasonably be supposed that as much was exhibited in those parts
of its structure which have perished, even if we had not LeGvar's direct evidence as to the
individual difference in plumage among the female birds. There would accordingly have
heen abundant room for the operation of any such process as that which has been de-
scribed under the names of © Natural Selection” and © Suryival of the Fittest” to have

operated; and it may therefore appear at first sight, there having been known to us only

one species of Pezophaps, that an argument against the existence of such a process might
hereon be founded.
