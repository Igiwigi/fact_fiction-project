Holotype: height 1-5 mm.; width 0-75 mm. Remarks. The fact that the outer lip does not apparently surpass the apex precludes
reference of the species to either Bulla or Cylichna; the outer lip, in addition, is not
prominent anteriorly as in Bulla. Cylichna volgensis Netschaew (B 1897, p. 193, Pl. 10, fig. 10),
from the Eocene of Russia, is considerably larger and has a more rounded apex. Bulla
nitens Sandberger as figured by Kissling (B 1896, p. 33, Pl. 3, fig. 1), from the Middle
Oligocene of Switzerland, has more shouldered whorls.
