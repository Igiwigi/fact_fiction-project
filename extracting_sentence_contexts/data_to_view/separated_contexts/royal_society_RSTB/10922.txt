Hence, hotspots reported to alter the chromatin structure in vitro [172] and

However, not every NDR region is a DSB hotspot [4]. and short poly-G runs with 6-14 bp, but short poly-A tracts
In S. cerevisiae, DSB formation is also influenced by with 6-14 bp and long poly-G>14 bp are under-represented
