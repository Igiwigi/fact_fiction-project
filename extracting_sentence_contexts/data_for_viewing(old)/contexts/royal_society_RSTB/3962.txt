elongated vertically to the surface; in each there are two imbedded  protoxylem-
groups, nearer one side than the other (Plate 28, Phot. 14). Where two bundles
are adjacent their protoxylems face opposite ways. The three other bundles lie
towards the inner side of the leaf-base. One of them is long and curved with the
concave side inwards and seems to have several protoxylem-groups; it probably
represents a fusion of two strands. No doubt the leaf-base is incomplete and would
have had more bundles altogether.

The three bundles in the cortex, all, apparently, destined for one leaf, are less
elongated in section than those of the leaf-base ; the longer axisis placed in the radial
direction. Sparganum cortex is preserved both on the stem and on the leaf-base.
The structure is manifestly of the Kalymma type, just as in the specimens described
by Grar zu Soums-Lausacu. The specimen in fact shows a Calamopitys stem in
connection with a Kalymma leaf-base and thus affords fresh evidence of the connection
of these fossils,

It is rather unfortunate that no bundles are seen, in this specimen, immediately
outside the wood, so that we cannot tell how long they retained their secondary wood.

The best specimens of Kalymma in our material are detached from the stem and will
be considered separately.

We may now sum up our results as to Calamopitys americana and briefly compare
it with other species.
