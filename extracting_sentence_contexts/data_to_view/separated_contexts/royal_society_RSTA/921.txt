human intervention is available, as well as an explanation. GDPR recital 71 in fact states: ‘The
data subject should have the right not to be subject to a decision, which may include a measure,
evaluating personal aspects relating to him or her which is based solely on automated processing
and which produces legal effects concerning him or her or similarly significantly affects him or
her.’ This seems like an overall exemption from automated processing, but the regulation also
specifies which scenarios are in turn exempt from this specification (for example, when subjects
given their assent). Much has been written about the ‘right to an explanation’, language which by
some authors is considered to be somewhat imprecise [74]. GDPR is also discussed by Blacklaws [2] in this discussion issue.
