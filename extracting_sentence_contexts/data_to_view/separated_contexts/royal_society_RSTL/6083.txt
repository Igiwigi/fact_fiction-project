IX. is shown the
closing septum of one of these specimens upon a more enlarged Fig. IX.
scale. Looking, however, to the circumstance that these specimens
bear but a very small proportion to those which exhibit no snch
tendency, and also to the fact that some of the specimens in
which this closing-in is seen are very far from having attained
their full growth, I am disposed to regard it as an abnormal, or
at least as only an occasional occurrence in Operculing; and I
must confess that, notwithstanding the positive assertion of
MM. Â»*Arcniac and Hans, I still entertain doubts as to whether
it is to be accounted as a uniform characteristic of Nummulites. At any rate, the occasional occurrence of this condition in Oper-
culina deprives the character of that constancy which is requisite
to make it good for generic differentiation ; and if Operculing and
Nummulites are to be retained as separate genera, I cannot per-
ceive by what features they are to be distinguished, save by the
marked compression in form, the limited number of convolutions,
and the external display of the whole spire, which are the obvious
though not very important characteristics of the former.

cative of reparation after injuries, which throw some light upon

the physiology of this type of organization.
