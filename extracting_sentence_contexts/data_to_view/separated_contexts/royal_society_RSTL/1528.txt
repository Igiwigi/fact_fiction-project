Faxev's Account of

nodules of great extent, or rather, perhaps, rudely crystallized
masses of slate, green-stone, sienite, basalt, &c. &c, forming
hills or mountains (often intersected by mineral veins) from
the tops of which masses, the red marle has in most instances
been denudated. It remains a task of great difficulty, yet to
be accomplished, to ascertain the lower part of the British
series of strata, thus only exposed to view, in local and uncon-
nected tracts, or basins, which are in part often concealed by
gravel (frequently s0, near their borders), and towards which
investigation, little has yet been done. It seems to me, that
there are three distinct series of coal-measures, if not more,
Separated by thick strata of red earths, or marles, not easily
distinguished from the upper one above the coal series, or
that which underlays the lias strata, as abovementioned, and
by thick strata of limestones ; each of which red earths, pro-
bably, produce anomalous and local strata, or crystallized
mountain masses, in different places, where they form the
surface, and the fact of such containing no organic remains,
may not have arisen from their having been formed before
organized beings existed, as those contend who call them
primitive rocks, but because the circumstances proper to crys-
tallization, were unfitted to the propagation and life of either
animals, or vegetables; and may it not be doubted, whether
crystallized masses, great or small, are ever the seats of re-
liquia ? The northern part of Derbyshire, and the adjoining parts
of the surrounding counties, present a denudated tract, and
partake of this uncertainty, as to what place in the lower part
of the British series of strata, its strata should be referred :
from many circumstances, I am inclined to consider the coal-

field of Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire, and Yorkshire, under-
laying the yellow-lime rock, as lower in the series than any
others of the coal-measures alluded to above, and that the
fourth limestone rock, which extends from Castleton in Der-
byshire, southward to Weaver Hill, near Wooton and Ramsor
in Staffordshire, is the very lowest which is known in Britain,
and which may account for the circumstance, that the mineral
veins and the strata in which they occur in Derbyshire, pre-
sent some phenomena, which are said to occur no where
else. I shall proceed now to describe the circumstances, under
which this great elevation and denudation of part of the Der-
byshire strata seems to have happened, which is, by a series
of three or four separately lifted tracts, one within the other,
as represented in the small sketch map annexed.
