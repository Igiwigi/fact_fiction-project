though at each humidity there are great inconsistencies between cages. The
question to be solved is this: could the difference between the two humidities
possibly be due to chance (i.¢., to the inconsistency of the material), or is it so great
that we must attribute it to the experimental conditions, even when allowance has
been made for the inconsistency? We then have two pairs of categories, two
humidities and two values of b (positive and negative). The question is whether
these categories are “ independent ” (FisHEer, 1932, p. 87), or not.

The matter may be tested by y?, and it can be shown that the differences between
44 and 11% could not reasonably be attributed to chance, either for submorsitans
(figures above) or for tachinoides (Table V) ; the difference between tachinoides at
44 and 19% are not significant (é.e., they might or might not be due to chance).
But when all the facts are considered, the effect of humidity on the birth-rate may
be regarded as proved.

The information given in Tables V and VI suggests several questions of interest.
It will be observed that even at the most favourable humidity the value of b is between
two and six, the mean for tachinoides being 2-85 and for submorsitans 4-62. But in
the preliminary experiments the birth-rate was also between two and six, though
the temperature was materially lower (p. 188). The explanation may be that 30° C
is a little above the optimum for reproduction ; or that exposure to unfluctuating
conditions of temperature and humidity is not favourable. The matter can only
be settled by further experiment. A third possibility exists, that the regulation of
humidity by solutions of potash has some effect on the metabolism of the flies.
Though the concentration of carbon dioxide is very low in the normal atmosphere,
