any other functions of the density than that of simple proportionality will be required,
and enable us to determine other terms of the series in descending powers of 7, and
will s0 give us probably a much more exact empirical formula for air than all the
data at present available enable ns to obtain.

We have also calculated formulze for the specific heats of air under constant pres-

rature and density are determined, Should they turn out to be inconsistent with
facts, other equations of condition will have to be introduced and other constants of
the empirical formula determined, to do away with the discrepancies; but probably
no experiments have yet been made of sufficient accuracy to test them.

The following expressions are derived from the general equations (7) and (8) for
the mechanical values of the specific heats of a fluid, by substituting for p the parti-
cular expressions for the case of air afforded by the empirical formula (39), and inte
