Its branching is exelusively monopodial, and its growth in length is, in some cases at
least, strictly limited, the phyllopodium terminating in a blunt, rounded cone.

Finally, in the Cycadacee the apex of the phyllopodium is covered by a clearly
marked layer of dermatogen ; its growth is never very conspicuously apical, though in
Cyeas, and perhaps in Dioon, it is more 80 than in other genera ; after the first stages
are past, the growth is exclusively intercalary. Tt is from the first a. bulky, rounded
structure, but it bears in most cases well-marked and comparatively bulky lateral
wings, extending from base to apex, and widened in the lower portions to form a
sheath. The branching is in all cases monopodial, but the order of development of
the branches is often basipetal.

Drawing together these facts, it is clear that in the above series of plants there may
be traced a progressive differentiation of the phyllopodium as a supporting organ on
the one hand, and of the other members of higher order which develop as flattened
expansions on the other. In the Hymenophyllacee the difference appears to lie
merely in the stronger development of a certain branch of each dichotomous system,
while other branches, similar to them in origin and conformation, are of more limited
growth, and assume a lateral position : gradually a monopodial mode of branching
becomes prevalent (most Leptosporangiate Ferns) ; this shows a difference from the
very firs between the podium and the members of higher order which it bears, but
the difference is again Jost where there is a return to the dichotomous mode of
branching. The next step is that the apex of the phyllopodium loses the structure
characteristic of flattened organs, and assumes that characteristic of cylindrical
structures (Osmundace@), and this is maintained during the development of the lower
