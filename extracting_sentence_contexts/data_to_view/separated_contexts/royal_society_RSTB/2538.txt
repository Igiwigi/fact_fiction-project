These facts may imply (1) greater toxicity of japaconitine, or (2) slower disap-
pearance of the toxic effect due to individual doses, whether this is due to delayed
elimination or otherwise is not decided ; but as it has been already shown that in a
single initial dose japaconitine is slightly more active, its stronger action on repetition
is probably mainly due to the first cause. _ 4, There is distinctly less tolerance towards repetition of pseudaconitine given in
the same relationship to the probable lethal, as in the case of the other two aconitines,
This holds equally for quarter lethal doses given at 90 minutes as for third lethal at
90 minutes, and half lethal at 2 hours. In fact, the summation of effect after the
longer interval is peculiarly striking. Lethal Dose of the Aconitines per kilogramme weight of Animal. (Time of Year for Frogs noted.)
