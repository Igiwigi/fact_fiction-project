Here again it will be seen, also, that the differences between
corresponding bands in solution and vapour spectra respectively, as was shown on
p- 519, amount to from 10 to 16 Angstrom Units, which represent the shift towards
the visible spectrum of different bands measured in solutions. Summary and Conclusions. The variations in the vapour spectra at different temperatures and pressures may
be explained by the fact that there are two kinds of absorption which are sharply. defined and may be differentiated ; these are distinguished by the terms general and
selective absorption. First, by rise of temperature, the general absorption is
