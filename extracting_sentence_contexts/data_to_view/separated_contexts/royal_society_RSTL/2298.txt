The curious fact, that the capacity of a sphere or cylinder is the same as that
of the plane area into which it may be supposed to be rectified, seems to afford some
new views in electricity. We find in the case of electricity accumulated on a hollow
sphere, that a conducting substance, insulated and placed entirely within the sphere,
remains in a neutral state; from which it has been inferred that the charge resides
only on the exterior snrface. Now the intensity of a sphere being the same as that,
of a plane circle of equal area, it should follow that the distribution is in each
alike, since it is difficult, from any known fact, to suppose a given quantity of electri-
city expanded over twice the surface, as may be inferred in the latter case, and yet
maintain the same intensity : the redundant electricity, therefore, if the above deduc-
tion be true, should be also disposed on one side of the plate only, notwithstanding
that it may be determined to either when operated upon by a neutral body.

60. The great difference in the condition of an electrified sphere and that of a plane
of equal area, seems to consist in the difference of the relation of one of the surfaces
of the sphere in respect to neutral bodies. It may be observed, in the case of a neutral
body becoming electrified from either side of the plane area, that some portion of the
body is always elevated without the surrounding plane ; and if a similar condition be
fulfilled in respect of the interior surface of a sphere, there will remain no difficulty in
obtaining electricity from that surface, and as readily as from the other: thus, a 8ub-
stance insulated within the sphere, at the extremity of a conducting rod, projecting in
