When the primordia of
these plates are first observed the distance between two adjacent pairs is two to three
times that between the members of a pair. Once the triradiate stage is reached two of
the rays grow more rapidly than the third, so that the plates grow away from each other
(fig. 30, A) and towards those of a neighbouring pair. At metamorphosis these plates
(which become the ten large buccal plates of the adult) are openly reticulate, and, owing
to the fact that the plates which originally constituted a pair diverge near the corona,
are grouped in pairs opposite the ambulacra (figs. 16 and 18). A re-arrangement similar
to this occurs in the case of the epiphyses DEVANESEN (1922, pp. 470-1). THE CALCAREOUS TEST OF ECHINUS MILIARIS. 297

At this stage the plates are practically all of equal size.
