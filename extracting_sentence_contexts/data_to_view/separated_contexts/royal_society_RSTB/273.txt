Irrespectively, therefore, of the sign of this difference, it may be assumed

S that the primary effect of excitation, that is, the first phase of the excitatory variation

% as described above, is the expression of a sudden difference of activity between the

* superficial and deeper cells near the upper surface.

= If the law above enunciated, namely, that change from the less active to the more

© active state is accompanied by an electrical change in the direction of relative

_— as the leaf retains its state of integrity, the upper surface, being the seat of greatest

6 activity, would be positive to the under, and that the response to excitation would

%@ gradual changes which in the plant are manifested by the loss of turgor, and which

“3 we may compare with the effects of injury in animal tissues, would have their electrical

counterparts in equally gradual changes towards negativity of the affected part. And,

8 inasmuch as by our mechanical experiments we know that the loss of turgor, in

‘g, common with other physiological changes, is localised in the superficial layer of cells

& of the upper surface, we should expect that complete freshness of the leaf would

2 be indicated by relative positivity (leaf current ascending), diminished turgor by

€ (leaf current descending) ; and, further, that in the first condition, the sign of the

3 potential, it would in the first state be descending, but as the cells of the upper

2 surface gradually lost their predominance of activity it would be diminished, and

E finally become ascending.

a When I resumed my investigation of the leaf of Dionea in 1885, the fact which
served as the starting point was the change in the electrical relation of the upper to
the under surface which is produced by leading through it a weak descending voltaic
current. The investigation of this change soon led to the discovery that the condition
of the leaf which I had called normal, in which the upper surface is negative to the
lower, is not that of its prime, but one of transition towards a state of diminished
activity. Then it was learned that, although the excitatory electrical effects which I
had described as belonging to this state are of greater intensity than those which are
witnessed when the leaf is in its prime, their right to be called normal is equally
questionable ; in short, that in vigorous leaves which have been successfully prepared,
