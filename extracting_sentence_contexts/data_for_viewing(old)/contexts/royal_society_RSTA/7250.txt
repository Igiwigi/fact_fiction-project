orbital of the sp* boron atom, since the carbon atom possesses no lone pair of valence electrons.
Rather, the different type of hybridization of the boron atom with the resultant increase
of s character in the bonds suggests itself as an important factor. This factor will also be
operative for aluminium bonds and still more for those of the metals in group II of the
Periodic Table.

That the covalent bonds decrease in strength with increasing atomic weight of the
elements in groups IIb and III is in no way surprising, and in fact to be expected from the
general behaviour observed for the bonds of the elements in other groups and subgroups.
A further point of interest for the alkyls of the metals in group ITA is that it requires more
energy to rupture one of the metal—C links than to break both of them, assuming that the
metal atom drops to the ground level. This fact may havea considerable influence on the mode
of decomposition of zinc, cadmium and mercury alkyls, and a study of the rates and
mechanisms of pyrolysis of these compounds would be well worth undertaking. Such
information as is already available is very meagre. Cunningham & Taylor (1938) have
studied the products of pyrolysis of mercury dimethyl above 290° CG and found that they
are mainly methane with a smaller amount of ethane plus a considerable quantity of a solid
which, it is suggested, might be a polymer of methylene. The primary act is clearly the
production of methyl radicals, but the experiments do not decide which of the processes
