the tax paid by the people above the threshold line. In this way, the economy is closed and total
wealth remains conserved.

3. Agent dynamics

Although the actual form of wealth distribution P(m) depends on the form of saving propensity
distribution, there is one thing common for all. The Pareto tail is present whatever be the form of
the saving propensity distribution; the only difference is in the value of the exponent. Here, the
saving propensities of all the agents are chosen from a uniform distribution which is the simplest
one. Although in this work, we are actually interested in the dynamics of a tagged agent, the
behaviour of overall distribution of wealth P(m) is also of great importance. The overall wealth
distribution shows the Pareto exponent to be roughly 1 as in the case of the conventional CCM
model [21,22] except for the fact that near my, there is a sharp change in the profile. This behaviour
can be understood by studying an individual agentâ€™s wealth distribution which will be addressed
in the next section. The wealth distribution P(m) is shown in figure 1 for Model A (a) and Model
B (b) for two different m,.

We perform numerical simulation for a system of N agents and look for the dynamics of a
tagged agent who is a BTL one with a predefined saving propensity. As we have stated earlier,
we use two models, namely A and B, for assigning subsidy.

(a) Wealth distribution

The distribution of wealth P(m,|A,) for different A, of the tagged BTL agent are shown in figure 2
for both Models A and B for my =0.1. For both the cases, the nature of wealth distribution is
