This is clearly due to the fact that intermittent discharges
"are necessarily much more violent during the very short period of time which they
= occupy than are continuous discharges ; and hence the velocity imparted to the mole-
'Seular streams is sufficient to make them impinge on the glass with the velocity requisite
<=to produce phosphorescence. TI will be noticed that we have here no change in the
Z degree of exhaustion, but only in the violence of the discharge ; and it is further to be
Qremarked that this increased violence can be obtained, either directly as in the case
— of the negative air-spark, or by way of response to a violent positive discharge in

But it is not only thus that the introduction of an air-spark can be made to produce

®* This fact alone is a sufficient warning against viewing the emission of these molecular streams as
indicating in any way a special direction of the electric discharge. It is, in our opinion, fatal to the idea
that these molecular streams prove that an electric discharge in a vacuum tube is a * negative flow.”
