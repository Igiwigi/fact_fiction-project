In particular, a silicon nitride nanocomposite containing 1.5 vol% graphene
inclusions shows 235% increase in the fracture toughness (from ~2.8 to ~6.6 MPa m!/â€™ 2), when
compared with monolithic Siz3N4 material. From a micromechanical viewpoint, toughening of
the nanocomposite occurs through crack deflection, crack bridging by graphene sheets, their
pull-out and necking (figure 5) [47]. It is important to note that cracks do not penetrate across
graphene sheets which in fact form curved two-dimensional structures/surfaces along GBs. Instead, when a growing crack meets with a graphene sheet, it grows along the sheet and thereby
follows curved path along GB surfaces. This crack deflection effectively hinders crack growth in
the nanocomposites.
