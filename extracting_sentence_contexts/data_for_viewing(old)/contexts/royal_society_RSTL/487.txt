the compound, by estimating the quantity of azote produced
in the decomposition of ammonia by it ; but I found that this
process was of no value for the purpose of analysis, for water
appeared to be decomposed at the same time with the ammo-
nia, and nitric acid formed ; and, in consequence, the quantity
of azote evolved was much less than it would have been, sup-
posing the ammonia decomposed by the mere attraction of
chlorine for hydrogen,

The results of the analysis of the new compound are inte-
resting for several reasons.

They shew, what seemed- probable from other facts, that
there is no strict law of analogy, which regulates the combi-
nations of the same substance with different substances. As
three of hydrogen combine with one of azote, and one of
hydrogen with one of chlorine, I thought it probable that the
new compound would contain three of chlorine to one of
azote, which is not the case.

This compound is the first instance known of one proportion
