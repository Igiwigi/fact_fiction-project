Bathymetry is the first-order parameter to account for reproducing the hydrodynamics in marine
systems. The bathymetry accounted for when establishing hydrodynamic models must not be
affected by tidal effects that will be simulated. The bathymetry could then be corrected by
the mean sea-level variation resulting from tidal currents. This correction is generally weak in
the English Channel (less than 0.1m). It could be significant in particular locations such as the
Alderney Race (more than 0.3m) and some other locations with strong tidal currents (figure 5b).
The lower mean sea level measured west of the La Hague Cape (that could be called ‘Goury
hole’) must be detailed to confirm differences between the measurements and simulation and the
proposed explanation that involves the mean current facing the La Hague Cape.

The observations also provide the opportunity to better account for the bottom friction effect.
In fact, in MARS this parameter is represented by the roughness height z0 with the formulation
of Soulsby (1995). z0 is a calibration parameter which is set constant everywhere in MARS2D
(0.0035 m). This parametrization could definitely be improved by adjusting this parameter
with the real space-dependent bottom friction effect. A better representation of this parameter
governs the reliability of the simulated hydrodynamics. All differences between measured and
simulated currents, mean sea-level fluctuations and tidal range, time phasing and dispersion
could potentially be improved, as shown in [40]. The Alderney Race is a sensible place to test
z0, which influences the entire hydrodynamic process. The measurements of the tidal wave
propagation (table 1) and the spatial variation of the mean sea level could be used to test such
parametrization. It influences all the mechanisms presented in the following sections.
