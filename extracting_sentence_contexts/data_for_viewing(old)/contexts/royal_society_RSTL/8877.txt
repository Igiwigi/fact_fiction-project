the velocities of' the ſeveral rays, upon which depend
the intervals of the fits, as has been now explained,
ariſe likewiſe their ſeveral degrees of refrangjbility.

9. But, as it is of great conſequence in philoſophy,
to diſtinguiſh between faQts and hypotheſes, however
plauſible, I obſerve, that the various refrangibility,
reflexibility, and inflexibility, of the different colours,
and their alternate diſpoſitions, at equal intervals, to
be reflefted and tranſmitted, which are the whole
ground-work of the Newtonian ſyſtem, are to be
confider'd as undoubted facts, deduced from experi-
ment ; but that the velocities of different rays are dif-
ferent in the manner now deſcrib'd, is no more than
probable conjecture : and tho? this point ſhould be
decided, by a method that we are now to propoſe,
