Their difficulty comes mainly from the fact
that they are not linear, so that the principle of superposition cannot be employed,
as in many branches of mathematical physics, to construct solutions by the method
of series or of singularities. For the same reason the flow pattern in the neighbourhood
of a moving body must alter when the speed of the body is changed, and it follows that
any exact determination of the pattern will be restricted to some definite speed. ‘As a matter of fact, no precise determination of this kind exists, except in cases where
the motion is indefinitely slow. But the form of the equations gives no reason for
doubting the possibility of “ steady ” motion (in which the velocities are functions only
of position) in every case of flow past fixed and rigid boundaries. Now in experiment
it is found (unless the velocities are very small) that eddying or periodic motions
always occur.
