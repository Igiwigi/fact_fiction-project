+ (==) [aa (t) — wa (Ig) (3.20)
In the recent years, a growing research interest has been devoted to this kind of equations, where
the linear differential operator x” is replaced by the so-called Minkowski curvature operator or


relativistic acceleration (see, for instance, [48-53] and references therein). Equation (3.20) is a
special case of a ¢-Laplacian equation

(o('))' + +a (f) — na” (Ig) = 0 (3.21)

with ¢:]—L,L[— R an odd strictly increasing homeomorphism (a singular homeomorphism,
according to [54]). The interest in studying equation (3.21), in the context of the present paper,
comes from the fact that, writing the equation as an equivalent first-order system in the
phase-plane of the for (3.1), we have that

h(t,y)=hy):=¢ ly), ,VyeR,

with |h(y)| < L for all y € R. Being h globally bounded, we have the global continuability of the
solutions for the initial value problems associated with (3.1) and, moreover, lemma 3.7 applies.
Then the following result holds.

Theorem 3.11. Assume (C5) and any integer m > 1. Then, there exists a positive constant .* = A*(m) ix
for which the following property holds: =

for each A > 2* there exists u* = u*(A) > O such that for each > yx*, equation (3.20) admits at least
