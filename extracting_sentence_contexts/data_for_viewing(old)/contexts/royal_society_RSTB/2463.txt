large sporangium has an irregular annulus, oblique in position, of which the induration
is incomplete on one side, and it is an interesting fact in this connection that the
actual point of dehiscence is not uniform in this case. Matonia, again, though it
maintains characters of the sorus and sporangium which suggest comparison with
Glvichenia, has a lateral dehiscence determined in position by the incomplete annulus.

It is to be noted that in these cases there is no highly specialised stomium, such as is
found in many Leptosporangiate Ferns. They appear to illustrate just such non-
specialised dehiscence as might be expected in cases where there has been a shifting
of the line of dehiscence from the median to a lateral position. Though the facts
noted do not in any way demonstrate that such a shifting has taken place along any
sequence of descent, they at least countenance the suggestion that there probably has
been a change from the median to the lateral dehiscence.

Taking now the position of the annulus as a whole, we see that it is oblique in the
Schizeeacer, Gleicheniacere, Hymenophyllacex, &c., while it is usually described as

& vertical in most of the Polypodiacese. The facts I have described above show that

â€œthe one type graduates by almost imperceptible steps into the other, while even

Sin those which are described as having a vertical annulus, details may often be traced
