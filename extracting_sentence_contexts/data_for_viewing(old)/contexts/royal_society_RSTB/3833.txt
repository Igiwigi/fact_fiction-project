As calcification gradually proceeds at this margin, this area becomes divided into
distinct circumscribed spaces, which surround the entering dentinal tubes.

The calcification does not quite reach the tube, and surrounds a hollow space in the
matrix, into which the stain injected from the pulp cavity penetrates (Plate 25, fig. 4).

It is common in human teeth to find spaces in the enamel at the dentine junction,
especially at the summit of the cusps of the dentine ; these spaces communicate with
the dentinal tubes. ‘These appearances have been much discussed, and various
opinions expressed as to their origin; it is denied by some observers that they
communicate with the dentinal tubes, but it is difficult to understand how this could
be doubted, and the injection method of von Beust demonstrates it as a fact,

Along with these spindles or spaces, narrow tubes in the enamel prolonged from
those in the dentine are not very uncommonly found. Plate 25, fig. 11, shows both
spindles and tubes in a human deciduous molar, in which the soft parts had been
fixed, and the tooth injected with fuchsin and a ground longitudinal section
prepared,
