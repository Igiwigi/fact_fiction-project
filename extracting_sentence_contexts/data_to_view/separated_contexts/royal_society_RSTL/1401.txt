As there is no: mud at/all on the top or
sides of the cave, we have no mark to distinguish the relative

part a fragment of bone or tooth of any of the extinct animals,
it will follow that this part was antediluvial. A farther argu-
- ment may be drawn from the limited quantity of post=diluvian
$talactite, as, well as from the undecayed condition of 'the
bones, to show that the time elapsed since the introduction of
the diluvian mud, has not been one of excessive length. The arguments arising from the detail of facts we have been
describing, are applicable to the illustration of analogous phe-
nomena, where the evidence of their history is less complete. In our own country there are five other instances of bones
similarly deposited in caverns, the origin of some of which,
though' not before satisfactorily made out, becomes evident as
a corollary from the proofs afforded by the cave at Kirkdale :
these are in Glamorganshire, Somersetshire, Derbyshire, and
Devonshire. r
