It thus appears that he considered these to be nece
the expansion. He describes his investigation as “ very incomplete and unsatisfac-
tory,”* and found himself unable to perform the expansion.

In regard to Rayteicn’s remark it may be contended that solutions applicable to
an infinite field (e.g., in the theory of elasticity or of the conduction of heat) have very
little bearing on the question of expansion in normal co-ordinates when the field is
limited and boundary conditions are imposed. In regard to the standpoint adopted
by Orr it may be remarked that we have succeeded in finding a method of expansion,}
but that this result does not seem to have much bearing on the question whether the
expansion is in fact valid. In ordinary harmonic analysis, for example, there is no
difficulty in determining values for the coefficients, but a relatively elaborate argument
has to be employed to justify the expansion. In many physical problems for which the
method of normal co-ordinates is employed, the validity of the expansion cannot be
established rigorously, but is asswmed.—presumably on the grounds of an argument
by induction, of the kind which has been given in§2. Nowsince this argument does
not involve the conjugate relations, its conclusion is not invalidated merely because the
conjugate relations do not hold. It seems reasonable to assume that the expansion is
valid, at least to the extent that an arbitrary disturbance can be defined with
sufficient accuracy by giving values to at » points in the field, where » may be very
large, but is finite.
