Now the form [ j&/, p] obtained by interchanging 7 and / in (ii) has the same partial degrees
as [ jkl,i]. We shall show that these forms are equivalent modulo forms of type [24]. In fact,
all equivalences being to this modulus,

2[ jal, 1] = [ phd, 1] —[ jlk, t] = (wh) (il) [(Ki’u) iL, — (liu) thy]
= (ih) (yl) (1K) (e'pp’) (upp’) = 2(A) (wl) (Wp) (@'p’) (upp’)
= 2(yl) (Wp) (0'lp')
