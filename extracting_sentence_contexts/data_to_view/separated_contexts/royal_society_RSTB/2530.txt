The “ centre of calcification” was, with those authors,
a neutral term, taking nothing for granted about the dark line (ex. Zuphyllia
Flabellum) or the dark points (ex. Mussa) themselves, but indicating merely the fact
observed that the calcareous fibres, in all cases, diverged outwards from those areas. Both Bourne and Fow:er had abundant opportunity of confirming Koca’s state-
ment that the skeleton was entirely of ectodermal origin. At the same time, they
accepted Hrrper’s term of calicoblast for the lime-forming cells of the ectodermal
layer.
