So far wis only defined as the parameter which determines
the particular surface. Choose the parameter so that f(y) = 1. ¥ is then analogous
to the stream-function in the simple case. It acts in fact as the stream-function for
the component of velocity v cos ¢. Similar reasoning leads to the conclusion that
wp cos ydn is also of the form f(p) dip, say fds. Hence

We started with the supposition that the stream-lines and vortex-lines must lie on
