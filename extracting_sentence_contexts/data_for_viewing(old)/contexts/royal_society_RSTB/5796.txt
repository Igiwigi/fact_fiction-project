re-organise itself so as to form a perfect leaf, if deprived of about half or more of one
of its stipular areas.

On the other hand, out of nine isolations of I, in which half or more of one stipular
area was left on the apex, though in four I, did not develop at all, yet in the five in
which it did develop it was always symmetrical, and never developed with one stipule
only. For in three of these experiments it developed into a complete leaf, with well-
formed stipules, though two of these leaves were of less than normal size, and in a
fourth experiment also it developed into a leaf with stipules, though the stipules were
very small, even relatively to the central part of the leaf, which was itself small. In
the fifth experiment it developed without any stipules. Since it was evident that in
four of these five isolations, just as in those of P,, the cuts were accidentally slightly
oblique, these facts indicate that I,, when deprived of half or more of its stipular areas,
can re-organise itself so as to form complete stipules at the expense of tissue that would
otherwise have gone to form the central part of the leaf. Thus, to use a convenient
term, a secondary determination of the material of the primordium into central part
and stipules has taken place at the stage of P,, but not, or not irrevocably, at that of I,.

In the isolations, whether of I, or P,, in which less than half of the stipular areas was
left on the apex, the isolated primordium always developed into a complete leaf possessing
both stipules. But it could not be seen from the sections whether the stipules were
quite of normal size or not, since the isolated leaves became irregularly folded.

Another point that may here be noted is that in the second group of isolations of P,,
in all except one (No. 346) a bud developed on the isolated piece in the axil of the
