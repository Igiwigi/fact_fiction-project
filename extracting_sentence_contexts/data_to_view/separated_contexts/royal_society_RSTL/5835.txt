Of the reproductive
organs of this group nothing whatever is known. No comparative anatomist has even
suspected the existence of the © segmental organ ” in any one of the members. STAx-
NIUs, KOLLIKER and DE QUaTREFAGES, and probably other microscopic observers, have
indeed established the fact that the ova and the spermatozoa are found on separate
individuals. Hence has been inferred the dicecious character of this group. Not one
single observation has ever been made by any of these observers as to the character of
the reproductive organs themselves. 'The author begs therefore to offer the succeeding
description as drawn exclusively from his own researches.
