sources, must be small. In reproducible measurements much the greater part of the total
error is contributed by the accidental errors. ‘These accidental errors, which are usually
to all intents and purposes normally distributed, produce no systematic bias in the means
of sets of observations. What does happen is that these random errors increase, on the
average, the scatter of the observations about their mean. Due to this increased scatter
the estimates of the variance of such sets of observations will be systematically too
large. Thus if a pair of variates is being considered, there will be no systematic bias in the
estimates of their means, while the estimates of their variances will be systematically too
large. However, if the errors in the two variates are independent, as is usually the case,
so that making a large positive error in the measurement of, say, x does not increase the
chances of making a similar error in measuring the corresponding value of y, then, on
the average, no bias will be produced in the estimate of the covariance of x and y. ‘These
facts mean that the magnitude of the coefficient of correlation between x and y will
be systematically underestimated. ‘This is important, and the point is worth developing
more formally.

As we have seen, observational errors produce no systematic bias in the means; but
they add to the expectations of x” and y? additional terms ¢, and ¢, respectively. ‘The errors
of x and y being independent, there is no addition to the expectation of xy. Then if 07,
o2 and ¢,0, are these expectations in the ideal case where there are no errors of measure-
ment; and o(?, 0/2? and o,0,,p’ are the corresponding expectations in the practical case,
