Let a, y, 2,7; 3,y,2,t;; - . be the coordinates of the points P, P,,. . respectiyely ; and let,

U=(z,y,,t9*=0,V=(6,y,2,9%=0/. . (1)

be the equations of the two surfaces whose contact is the subject of consideration. The

conditions of contact may, as is well known, be written thus :

0, U'::0,U":>02U" "00:

=0@:V. .,0,V,.- 0.0 | (2)

Another form of these conditions is, however, better adapted to our present purpose. In fact, writing

9,Vo.U—2,Va,U=3 U, 2,Vd,U—d,Vd,U=8,U, |

d,V0,.U—d,Va.U=3,U, d,Va,U—d,Va,U=3,U,
d,Vd,U—d,Vo,U=3,U, d.Vd,U—d,Vd.U=3,U,
or, more briefly,

we may take as the conditions necessary, in order that V shall touch U at the point P,
any two of the six following, viz. :
dU=0,:5,U=0; ...,U=0, ET
Similarly, as I have shown in a memoir © On the Contact of Surfaces ” (Phil. Trans.
1872, p. 259), we may take as the further conditions that V (assumed to touch U at the

point P) may have a three-branch contact * with V at the point P, any three inde-
pendent equations of the following system :

YU=0,3,U=0,".13,U==0;p. wed rojo; wt
and 80 on for higher degrees of contact. For the purpose of the present inquiry it will be convenient to transform the equa-
tions (5) and (6) into yet another shape.
