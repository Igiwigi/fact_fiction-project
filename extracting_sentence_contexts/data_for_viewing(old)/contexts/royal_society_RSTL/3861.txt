the elot-on- the wounded part. ZEighthly, that after this union the injury begins to be
Q repaired by the development from the injured surface, of parts corresponding to
NJ those which -have been removed. MNinthly, that at least one change of skin is neces-
S sary to the production of a new limb, when the injury has been severe, or the entire
bog limb has been removed. That the removal and reproduction of a part, and the
= healing of the wound, do not prevent, although they certainly retard, the natural
=D changes of the animal; and that reproduction of lost parts takes place in the
metabolic as well as in the ametabolic Articulata.
