but no one has seen a piece of still water frozen at the bottom *,‚Äù

But there is nothing more easy of experimental proof than that heat radiates through
water. IT do not mean, however, to vindicate the reasoning of Mr. M'Kzgver re-
specting the more powerful radiation of it from stones than from mud. His reason-
ing respecting that matter is, on his own part, conjectural, to explain the readier
formation of gru on a stony or gravelly bottom ; but the gru also forms on a muddy
bottom, a fact which M. Araco notices, when he brings the attachment of mud to
the under side of the floating flakes as a proof that they haye been formed at the
bottom. Mr. MKegver was driven to his conjecture from having overlooked the
more complete and sudden inversion of the hydrostatic order that takes place over
stones than over mud ; which last is deposited only in places where the water has a
stiller and more equable motion. In snch places the ground-gru is later in forming,
and therefore is more rarely seen; and it is doubtful whether Mr. M'Kezver had a
proper opportunity for noticing it in them.
