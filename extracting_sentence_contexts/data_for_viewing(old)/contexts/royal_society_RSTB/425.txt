We have assumed that the construction of the whole neuro-muscular apparatus of
the larynx comprises (1) an area-of cortex popularly, though incorrectly, termed the
cortical laryngeal centre, (2) a similar area in the bulb or medulla oblongata which
may in like manner be spoken of as the bulbar laryngeal centre and is connected
with the cortical apparatus by fibres running in the corona radiata and internal
capsule, while finally the vago-accessory nerve roots and peripheral branches contain
the fibres supplying the laryngeal muscles and mucous membrane.

Tt was first observed by Hoorer* that even when the recurrent nerves were cut
inhalation of large doses of ether produced paralysis of the closers (the adductors) of
the glottis before the openers (the abductors). We repeated+ and extended in further
detail this observation and showed that this remarkable peripheral and differential
action of ether was, in all probability, due to the fact that the antagonistic muscles of
the larynx belong to classes of muscles biologically different.

Hoorer’s original observation was contested by Donaupson,{ who found that in
certain cases one of the two groups of muscles predominated according to the strength
of the stimulus, that with a feeble current, opening, with a strong current, closing, of
the glottis was produced. A further, later research by Hoorrr§ showed that the same
effect is produced by varying the rate (7.¢., the intensity ?) of the stimuli, with a slow
rate of interruption of a constant current abduction being obtained, with a quick
rate adduction.

We have observed Donaxpson’s result to be occasionally present, and from general
considerations are ready to believe that Hooprr’s second observation is correct. It is
