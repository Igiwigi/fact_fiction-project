an older leaf primordium of the original apex; while figure 12 shows the apex of the new
lateral bud. This bud apex was considerably smaller than the original apex, as were also
its constituent cells. In fact, these bud apices resemble those of young sporophyte plants. In
proximity to the necrosed apical cell, the tissues had undergone a characteristic paren-
chymatous development.

(d) The effect of three-quarter ringing

For comparison with the materials described above, the apex in some specimens was
only three-quarters ringed, i.e. two parallel vertical incisions and a third vertical incision
at right angles were made. The apical meristem had thus continuity of tissues, including
vascular tissue, on one side.
