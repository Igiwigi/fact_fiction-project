the “ascending system” of Acmopyle would probably be marked by the reflexed
strands in text-fig. 26 which, as stated on p. 276, lie just under the ridge. That
portion of the dorsal valve of the cupule which lies beyond the ridge would thus
correspond to the “descending system” of Podocarpus. The ventral part of the
cupule of Aemopyle must be regarded as a new acquisition, related in origin to the
semi-erect position of the seed.

Although in broad outline, the above suggestion seems to afford a reasonable
interpretation of Acmopyle in terms of Podocarpus, there remains one difficulty,
which must at present remain unexplained, namely, the double nature of the cupule
on the ventral side of the seed. Is it that the erection of the seed from the
Podocarpus-like condition took place in two distinct stages, so that first the outer
ventral are was acquired and then the inner? The fact that of the two arcs the
inner extends to a point nearer the chalaza (see text-fig. 6) than does the outer at
any rate does not contradict this hypothesis. In this connection an examination of
younger material would be of some interest. On the other hand, it may of course be
that the process of erection is not merely ontogenetic, but is spread over the
phylogeny of Acmopyle. In that case a Podocarpus-like form must have existed
with a horizontal seed intermediate between these two genera.

We shall now consider Srrixs’s theory that the elaborate vascular system of the
seed of Podocarpus is not homologous with that in the older Gymnosperms. As
stated on a previous page, I prefer to draw the line between the integument and
epimatium just outside the ring of descending strands, considering only the
peripheral portion of the flesh as the epimatium, and the inner region (containing
