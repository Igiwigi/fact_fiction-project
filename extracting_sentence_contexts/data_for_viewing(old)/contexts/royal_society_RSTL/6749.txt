- 6. The very great reducing-power operating in those parts of the plant where ozone
18 most likely, if at all, to be evolved, scems unfavourable to the idea of the oxidation of
Nitrogen into nitric acid by its meansâ€”that is to say, under circumstances where the
much more readily oxidizable substance, carbon, is not oxidized, but, on the contrary its
oxide, carbonic acid, is reduced ; whilst, as has been seen, when beyond the influence
of the direct rays of the sun, the cells xeem to supply an abundance of the more easily
oxidized carbon, in a condition of combination readily available for oxidation by free
Oxygen, or ozone, should it be present. The conclusion that free Nitrogen would not
be likely to be oxidated into nitric acid within the structures of the plant, seems to
be borne out by the well-known fact, that nitrates are as available a source of Nitrogen

to plants as ammonia; and hence, if we were to admit that Nitrogen can be oxi,
into nitric acid in the plant, we must swppose, as in the case of carbon, that there
conditions under which the oxygen compound of Nitrogen is reduced within
organism, and that there are others in which the reverse action, namely, the oxidai }
of Nitrogen, can take place. In relation to this question, it may be mentioned
several specimens of green Wheat and Grass which had been liberally manured
nitrates were examined for nitric acid, but no trace of it was found in them.
