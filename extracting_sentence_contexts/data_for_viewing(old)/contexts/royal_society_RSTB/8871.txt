consensus haplotypes and haplogroups were determined
using multiple replicates (ie. samples from independent
extracts and amplifications performed at different times);
(iv) the mutational patterns of the clones were consistent
with those previously described for aDNA (electronic sup-
plementary material, figure S1); and (v) all results from the
HVR-1 sequencing and mtSNP genotyping were consistent.

(c) Y-chromosome analysis

Very few positive results were obtained for the Y-chromosome
SNP analyses, highlighting the fact that degradation of nuclear
genomic DNA in ancient human samples remains a problem.
However, the paternal lineage of one individual from the
Grotte Cadet site was identified. This sample (Cadet-1) was
assigned to the Q-M3 paragroup. Today, this haplogroup is
most commonly found among Native American populations

(b) mtDNA sequence variation and widespread throughout the Americas [40,41].

Mitochondrial haplogroups could be characterized for 13
of the samples, and the results revealed the presence of three

distinct Amerindian mitochondrial lineages: A2 (n= 5), Cl (d) Sequence and population diversity
