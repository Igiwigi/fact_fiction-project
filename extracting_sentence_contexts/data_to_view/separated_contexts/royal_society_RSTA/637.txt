Both features are consistently defined by the corresponding =
sets of effects manifested in measuring instruments, effects from which we infer the existences of :
elementary particles, in the first place. An elementary particle of a given type, say, an electron,
is defined by a given set (potentially very large, but specific to each particle type) of possible nee)
phenomena or events observable, as effects, in measuring instruments associated with it. This :
set is the same for all electrons, although the correlation between any such phenomenon and a]
any given electron can never be strictly (rather than statistically) assured, which already reflects DNS
the fact that electrons are indistinguishable from one another. To cite H. Weyl, â€˜the possibility if
that one of the identical twins Mike and Ike is in the quantum state El and the other in the 3
quantum state E2 does not include two differentiable cases which are permuted on permuting .
