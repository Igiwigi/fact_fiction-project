I rave the honour of transmitting to you a' fact relative to arr
elephant's tusk, in which: the iron head -of a spear was lately
discovered to have been imbedded. The tusk weighed fifty pounds: it-measured six feet in length;
and was supposed, by Mr. Pore, an eminent manufacturer at
Birmingham, -to have come from Africa, as he procured it at a
sale in Liverpool. When it was delivered into the hands of the workmen, they
perceived, on the tusk being shaken,.a rattling noise, about two
feet and a half from the base; and, in consequence, made a
transverse section, Somewhat below the part whence the sound
proceeded.
