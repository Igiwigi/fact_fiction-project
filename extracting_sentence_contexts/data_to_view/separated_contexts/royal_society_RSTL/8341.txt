It may be
remarked that (40) is a transformation of sec am (9, &')=cos am 1, but (42) is merely a
transformation of cos am u=cos am v. If, therefore, we perform the process of $11 in
reverse order (#. e. starting with the trigonometrical side of the identity to be proved,
sum the rows instead of transforming them) we obtain (42) at once. It appears at first sight as if ScHELLBACH's formula

(45)

gave rise to another formula for the cosine amplitude, by writing a for > and changing
the modulus from & to &' ; but this, in fact, merely gives an expression already obtained ;
for the right-hand side of (45), on writing a for & and &”* for q, becomes
(—)* cosh 8
8ech a+4 cosh LÞ2 256 cosh 22 + cosh 25p*
, cosh (7—s) + cosh (7+)

cosh (> —$p) cosh (7 +84)
=s8ech x +E7(—)'{sech (—$p)+8ech (z+$p)}.

which

Formulz such as (45) are the nearest approach I have met with to those numbered
(10) to (17) and the other expressions at the end of < 5; but (besides that an imaginary
transformation is required to reduce them to these forms) they do not put in evidence
the periodicity of the functions. Q 14. It is perhaps desirable to place side by side, for convenience of comparison, all
the different forms into which one of the functions, the cosine amplitude, has now been
thrown.
