partition.
Consider a partition such as 122, then replacing each number by a line of units thus,

and summing the columns, we obtain a new partition 31, which may be called the con-
jugate* of 1*2, Tt is easy to see that the expression for the combination 6c (for which
the partition is 172) contains with the coefficient unity, the symmetric function (31), the
partition whereof is the conjugate of 1*2. In fact Pc=(—E&z)(EzB), which obviously
contains the term +1, and therefore the symmetric function with its coefficient
+1(31); and the reasoning is general, or

Theorem. A combination 67@.. contains the symmetric function (partition conjugate
to 1/29...) with the coefficient unity, and 8ign + or — according as the weight is even
or odd.

Imagine the partitions arranged as in the preceding column, viz. first the partition
ito one part, then the partitions into two parts, then the partitions into three parts,

fe magnitude of the greatest part (the greatest magnitude first), and in case of equality
cording to the magnitudes of the next greatest part, and s0 on (for other examples,
