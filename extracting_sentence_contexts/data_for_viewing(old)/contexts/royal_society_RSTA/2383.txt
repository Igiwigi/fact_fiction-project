their energy. Secondly, an upwelling of stratospheric hydrocarbons into the upper atmosphere
provides an efficient sink for Hj ions, since hydrocarbons quickly destroy Hj . Because this would
predominantly affect regions close to the homopause, where the temperature is relatively low,
an observation of the entire column of H} would therefore exclude the cold population at low
altitudes, and therefore result in a higher observed temperature. Thirdly, the breaking of waves


generated in the lower atmosphere induce a vertical wind shear in the thermosphere, producing a | |
jagged appearance of the electron density altitude profile, in which case the effective Hy peak can

be shifted to higher altitudes [34], where it is hotter, producing a higher observed H} temperature. â€œ3

Heating by tropospheric storms may explain the fact that the temperature is hotter in 2014 1S
than in 2013, while the column density is lower. If the explanation of advecting methane into the : gS
upper atmosphere is valid, the particularly low density of Hy noted in 2015 might suggest that : 2

this methane remained, or was replenished, in the upper atmosphere for at least a year.

(c) Local-time profiles of the ionosphere

Figure 5 shows four typical local-time profiles contained within the dataset analysed here, with : s
the peak intensity occurring at local times between 13 and 15. The peak ionization rate is expected 13
to occur at local noon, and smaller solar-zenith angles produce higher ionization rates. Unless the {=
temperature changes dramatically across local times, then the location of the observed intensity : a
maximum is also the location of the peak column integrated Hj density. It is currently unclear : =
