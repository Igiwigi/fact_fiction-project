Using the arguments above and N=h-(/?-5), the first half <fh-?°N-!=n'/2-%_ This
idea would not be enough for the second half, because the additional factor h~/? would
ruin the estimate. Instead, for fixed @ let us consider f(r) := 1 kyl mh®k — rh-/2 | m[h*l —
rh—'/?](sin((k — 1)N0)/(k — DN) and observe that by a change of variables f(r) is h/2+9 periodic.
Moreover, we see that for any n € N we have (fo < (Cmn)Cnn-/2, where we used estimates
onm) and the fact that each derivative introduces a factor h~!/2. Let us now fix n > 1, and observe
that f has to have mean zero (due to periodicity of f"—), in particular there exists t € (0,'/2+*)
such that f(t) =0. Using the bound on f+) and first-order Taylor expansion, we get for any
s €(0,hY/2+5) that [f(s)| < ||fOt foohl/2+3 < (Cyt) Cn? h—/2pU/248 < (Cyn) Cn? 4240-2, We
can now iterate such an estimate, and, as in each step we improve the exponent by 4, after 1/(28)
steps we get that |f’| < (Cinn)(Cn" n/2 with n ~ 1/5, which then leads to an estimate |8-(ue,—/7)| <
(Cin/5)(Cn/) 1/228. The estimate |3,(19 /r)| < (Cin/3)Cn/9 1/225 follows immediately.
Using that &(r, 0) = Wosc(r,0) + Wy(r) — 1? /2R and the definition of u;, we see that
