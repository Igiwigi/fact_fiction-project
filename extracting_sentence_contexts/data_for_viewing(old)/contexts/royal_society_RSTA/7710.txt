stating that, whatever 6,° and whatever the values of other parameters 03, ... 6),

the probability that the interval should cover the true value 0,°, is equal to «.
This is the common property of the systems of confidence intervals considered.
Now it is obvious that whilst it is desirable that the true value of 6, = 6,° should
be covered by the confidence interval } (E) determined by an observed sample point
E, it is not so with any other value of 06, = 0’; # 0,°. In fact, the presence of the
value 0’, # 0,° within an interval 8 (E) containing 0,° is unnecessary and may be

interpreted as an indication that this interval is “ too broad’’. It is clearly impossible
to avoid altogether covering the values of 0, which are not true. But we may try
to diminish the frequency of 3 (E) covering any value 6’, 4 6,° to a minimum.
This leads us to the following definition of the shortest system of confidence intervals.

Ifa system, Cy, of confidence intervals 3, (E) has the property that whatever any
other system C of intervals 3 (E) corresponding to the same confidence coefficient
