motions through the ether more sluggish, and tend to bring the periods of oscillation
into isochronism with the slow undulations of obscure heat, thus enabling the molecules
to absorb more effectually such rays as have been made use of in our experiments.

Let me here state briefly the grounds which induce me to conclude that an agreement
in period alone is not sufficient to cause powerful absorption and radiation ; that in
addition to this the molecules must be s0 constituted as to furnish points d'appui to
the ether. The heat of contact is accepted with extreme freedom by rock-salt, but a
plate of the substance once heated requires a great length of time to cool. 'This
surprised me when I first noticed it. But the effect is explained by the experiments of
Mr. BaLyouR STEWART, by which it is proved that the radiative power of heated rock-
salt is extremely feeble. Periodicity can have no influence here, for the ether is capable
of accepting and transmitting impulses of all periods; and the fact that rock-salt
requires more time to cool than alum, simply proves that the molecules of the former
glide through the ether with comparatively small resistance, and thus continue moving
for a longer time ; while those of the latter presenting broad sides to the ether, speedily
communicate to it the motion which we call heat. This power of gliding through still
ether, possessed by the rock-salt molecules, must of course enable the moving ether to
glide round them, and no coincidence of period could, I think, make such a body a
powerful absorber.

Many chemists, I believe, are disposed to reject the idea of an atom, and to adhere to
that of equivalent proportions merely. They figure the act of combination as a kind of
interpenetration of one substance by another. But this is a mere masking of the funda-
mental phenomenon. 'The value of the atomic theory consists in its furnishing the
