He
asserted that in different European countries and for different times the distribution of income
follows a power law behaviour, i.e. the cumulative distribution P(w) of agents whose wealth
is at least w is given by P(w) xw™® [1]. Today, this power law distribution is known as Pareto
distribution, and the exponent a is named the Pareto index. The fact that the income distribution
follows a power law was evidence, to Pareto, that ‘the distribution of income is not the result
of chance’ [1]. This is probably one of the first arguments in favour of liberalism and equal
opportunities: given equal chances everybody can have an opportunity of access to higher
positions in the social scale. However, the end of the twentieth century and the beginning of the next one have exhibited
an enormous increase in inequality, despite the undiscussed leadership of liberalism in most
countries, particularly after the dissolution of the USSR.
