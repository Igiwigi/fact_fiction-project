replication phenomenon. In the first stage, the curvature instability affects the circular shape
of localized patches and leads spontaneously to the formation of arcs. In the second stage, the
arcs transformed into non-rotating spirals that occupy the whole space available in a given arid
landscape.


These qualitative results cast new light on the interpretation of the dynamics of tussock- Ee
forming species as alfa. The dieback in the centre of the tufts may not be a detrimental

consequence of necromass accumulation as sometimes hypothesized [52] but rather a direct “3
consequence of the dynamics of grass biomass exerting facilitative and competitive non-local :8
interactions of distinct ranges. In our study site, the proportion of necromass is lower than ig
mentioned in the literature, possibly because of a strong grazing pressure. This fact may explain : a

why bare soil was frequently observed at the center of the ring-shaped or doughnut-like
structures (figure 1) in agreement with simulations (figures 6 and 7). Structures of this type are
barely mentioned in literature dealing with alfa (but see [49]). In the absence of model predictions,
several authors may not have been deemed relevant to report and interpret similar structures.

The existence of structures of different morphologies clearly supports the interpretation that 72
tussock shapes, even circular and compact ones, may not be genetically predetermined but rather Dos
shaped by a dynamical process in interaction with the environment. This was hypothesized and : =
modelled by [53] regarding Festuca orthophylla and may also apply to alfa. Since the model we : a
use is parameterized from plant characteristic sizes (notably La), the question is: on which type of 73
plant modules (or ‘ramets’) should such parameters be measured? : XS
