ratures of the oxygen and hydrogen were therefore more comparable, and the resulting
correction was small. In several of the other determinations the correction was larger
than in series 8. As regards series 1 and 2 a similar correction was necessary. The

time interval in question was in most cases rather greater, since the hydrogen took
longer to obtain. On the other hand, the correction for the imprisoned bubble was
probably a little smaller. The presence of this bubble had escaped observation in the
early part of the research, owing, perhaps, to the fact that the mercury in the pipette
was very clean and therefore trapped a smaller quantity of gas.* With long continued
use and contact with rubber tubing, inevitable slight fouling occurred.

That the average volume of the imprisoned bubble was increasing very slightly
during the later stages of the research, was proved by actual measurement. Both
these opposing errors may therefore have been smaller in the earlier series. Taking

into account the very close agreement of the means it seemed fairest to apply the same
“ contraction” correction throughout, and to reduce the means of all four series by
6 parts in 100,000. Collecting all the results we have :—
