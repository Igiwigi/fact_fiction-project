Rejecting those cases in which the inequality is very small or altogether irregular,
it appears that the inequality vanishes twelve days after the moon's inclination yanishes. This is certainly a very extraordinary result ; for it is difficult to conceive how the
effect of the moon's action can require s0 much time to manifest itself. Yet there
can hardly be any doubt of the fact; for it is verified in 11 semilunations out of 17,
and is inconsistent with none; the variations in the interyal being not greater than
might be expected, supposing the law to be true. It may be observed, that by these
variations the inequality is in some cases thrown back more than a whole semiluna-
tion. 'Thus the inequality which prevails before April 26, and vanishes about that
day, is not produced by the series of declinations which vanish on April 24, but by
the series which vanish on April 11.
