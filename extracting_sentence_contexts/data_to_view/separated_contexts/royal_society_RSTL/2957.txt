In the course of this investigation, which occupied many months, the number of
individual animals examined was very large, furnishing me an opportunity for yeri-
fying most of the facts by repeated observation. The examinations were generally
made very s00n after death; and the drawings having been all taken by myself, I
have it in my power to say that their fidelity may be relied upon. In the year 1837, preparatory to the commencement of my own researches, I spent
some time in Germany for the purpose of becoming acquainted with the known
facts on animal development and other objects of microscopic research ; and cannot
omit this opportunity of gratefully acknowledging the facilities afforded me on that
occasion by my honoured friends Professors Jonanxn MuLLEr, EnrgxBeRG, RUpoLePa
Wage, and Dr. Ta. Scuwann. The microscope I use is an achromatic, since
made for me by Scmitx of Berlin, and similar in all respects to the instrument em-
ployed by Professor ExRENBERG. It may not be improper in the first place to furnish an idea of what has been
already published on some branches of the sabject; for it is one to which the atten-
tion of physiologists in this country has scarcely begun to be directed.
