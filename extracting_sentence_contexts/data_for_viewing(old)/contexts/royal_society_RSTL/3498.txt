merely unlike every other natural power as to the phenomena it could produce, but
also in the far higher points of limitation, definite force, and finite production (2065.).

1799. I venture to hope that the experimental results and arguments which have
been thus gathered may be useful to science. I fear the detail will be tedious, but
that is a necessary consequence of the state of the subject. The contact theory has
long had possession of men's minds, is sustained by a great weight of authority, and
for years had almost undisputed sway in some parts of Europe. If it be an error, it
can only be rooted out by a great amount of forcible experimental evidence; a fact
sufficiently clear to my mind by the circumstance, that Dz 1a Rive's papers have not
already convinced the workers upon this subject. Hence the reason why I have
thought it needful to add my further testimony to his and that of others, entering
into detail and multiplying facts in a proportion far beyond any which would have
been required for the proof and promulgation of a new scientific truth (2017.). In
s0 doing, I may occasionally be only enlarging, yet then I hope strengthening, what
others, and especially Dx La Riv, have done.

1800. It will tend to clear the question, if the various views of contact are first
Stated. Voura's theory is, that the simple contact of conducting bodies causes elec-
tricity to be developed at the point of contact without any change in nature of the
bodies themselves; and that though such conductors as water and aqueous fluids
