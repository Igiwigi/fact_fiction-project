to some extent replaced by lactie acid, hence the CO, pressure in the alveolar air is
lowered.

There are, of course, those (18) who do not accept the theory of the respiratory
centre being actuated by the increased hydrogen-ion concentration of the blood, but
regard CO, as a specific stimulus. Such would suppose that lactic acid production
has a secondary effect on the respiratory centre, liberating CO, from its combinations
in the centre, and thus forming increased quantities of CO, in the centre itself which

act as a stimulus. Such a theory would account for the facts up to a certain point.
This point seems to me to be the one at which a fresh equilibrium is established in the
body. So long as lactic acid is accumulating in the body it is possible to conceive
of fresh liberation of CO, in the respiratory centre, but at the end of a long slow
grinding climb it is difficult to suppose that such accumulation is taking place.
Further experiments might be performed on the time at which this equilibrium is
reached, but once the lactic acid loss becomes equal to the lactic acid production
it is not easy to see how the respiratory centre can be stimulated in the presence ot
decreased carbonic acid in the alveolar air if carbonic acid is the specific stimulus.
One explanation might be forthcoming, namely, that in view of the increased rate of
blood flow and of respiration during the exercise the pressure gradient of CO, between
the respiratory centre and the alveolar air might become steeper. No doubt it
does so, but in view of the great solubility and diffusibility of CO, it seems unlikely
