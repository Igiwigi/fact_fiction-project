obtained by ReGNavtt, is the one which has been generally adopted in work with
the platinum thermometer. :

As further evidence in confirmation of this conclusion GrirritHs points out that,
if this number be taken for the boiling-point of sulphur in the calculation of the
values obtained by him for the boiling and freezing points of a number of substances
on which he experimented, the results for most of the substances concord better with
their accepted values as determined by other observers, than if REGNAULT's value,
448°°34, be adopted.

Many of these accepted numbers quoted in GRIFFITHS’ paper are given to hundredths
of a degree, but closer examination of the original papers in most cases reveals the
fact that the reductions to the normal scale and the various corrections of the thermo-
meters employed, if made at all, are, to say the least, very uncertain. Further, we see
no @ priori reason why, in GrRIFFrrHs’ experiments, the results with certain of the
substances employed should be rejected from consideration, as there does not appear
sufficient ground for supposing that the experimental error in these cases was higher
than the average.

Substantially then our knowledge of temperatures, deduced by means of the platinum
thermometer, depends solely on the correctness of the conclusions of GrirriTHs and
CALLENDAR :—

(1) That the boiling-point of sulphur under 760 millims. pressure is 444°-53.
