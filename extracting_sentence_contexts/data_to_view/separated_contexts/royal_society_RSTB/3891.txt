The diversity, even among members of the same brood, is greatly increased by
abnormal environments, but, in the light of the experience gained from the main
part of this paper, it must be ascribed to purely somatic fluctuation, and not to
genetic variation. Nor can it be ascribed to the different reactions by different
genotypes, since, as we have seen, the material was throughout genotypically
uniform. The fact that purely somatic fluctuation is increased when a biotype is subjected to
abnormal conditions must be reckoned with when discussing the increased variability
observed under such conditions from the point of view of its evolutionary significance. APPENDIX II.
