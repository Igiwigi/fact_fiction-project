of the needle, although it was hid by the coloured glass placed over the glass
top of the instrument. In order that I might have a tolerably correct measure
of the temperature within the compass-box during the different observations, I
placed inside, a small spirit thermometer, graduated on ivory, and having the
tube fixed to the scale by narrow bands of paper. I likewise employed a
powerful lens eleven inches in diameter to concentrate the rays on the space in
which the needle vibrated. I attempted also to bring the focus of the lens
within the compass-box, but the heat was $0 great that it burned part of the
apparatus ; and I desisted, lest by injuring the essential parts I should put an
end to my experiments. The coloured glass consisted of two semicircles, each
having a small concentric semicircle cut out, 80 that they fitted each other
round the tube carrying the suspending wire. Having clearly ascertained the
fact that the effect produced on the magnetized needle was different from that
on any other, the observations which I now made were on the vibrations of a
magnetized needle alone ; and I employed that which I had already used, re-
moving however the additional weight of paper which had been fixed to it, 80
that its weight was now only 197 grains, and its time of vibration was likewise
diminished. The following are the observations which I thus made.
