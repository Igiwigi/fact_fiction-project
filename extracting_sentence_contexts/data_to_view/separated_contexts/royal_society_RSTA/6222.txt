Darabi & Itskov [34], for example, recently proposed a model for the constraint contribution
that combines ideas from the tube and slip-link [80] theories. The corresponding expression
for the free energy (eqn 27 in [34]) cannot be brought in the form (3.15) with only positive
constants. In light of the previous considerations, the known proximity of the Arruda—Boyce and Gent
models is based on the fact that they differ only in the representation of the chain force, ie. a
single variation within the four-step procedure, which allows them to be distinguished from each
other. Such single variations lead to what we will refer to as ‘close relatives’ and which we will
analyse in the next section with respect to Ogden’s model in a molecular statistical form (3.19) as
a basis.

5. Variations on Ogden’s model

The incompressible Ogden model [1] in its unaltered original form is indisputably one of the
most successful and versatile hyperelastic approaches to studying rubber elasticity, with many
uses even beyond this class of materials.
