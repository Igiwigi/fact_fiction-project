For the constant k Buisson and Fasry, following Scu6nrock, adopted the value
1-22 x 10°, and the value of N which they found experimentally was in approximate
agreement with the view that the spectrum was to be referred to the atom. This result
has recently been criticised by Sawa (‘ Phil. Mag.’ (6), 40, p. 159, 1920) on the ground
that Buisson and Fasry obtained a much smaller value for N in the case of the line
Ha, the first member of the Balmer series, and that if the value of & in the formula given
above were calculated from the observed limit of interference for the line Ha, the
secondary line would yield a value of M more nearly appropriate to the molecule H.,.
The ground of this criticism does not appear to us to be justified, for it is well known that
the line Ha is complex and could not therefore be expected to yield results in accord-
ance with the theory for a single line, and moreover Sana appears to have overlooked
the fact that the value of / adopted by Buisson and Fanry was tested experimentally
with lines of the rare gases, and was found to give results in close agreement with the
known atomic weights of these gases.

It must, however, be pointed out that any cause of broadening of the lines other than
that due to motion in the line of sight will yield too low a value for the mass of the
radiating particles; and it follows that measurements of this kind can only set an
inferior limit to the mass, unless the possibility of broadening of the lines by any other
cause can be excluded.

In the present investigation we have remeasured the wave-lengths of the lines of the
secondary spectrum in International Angstrém units, and have been able to add a con-
siderable number of lines to those hitherto recorded. We have also investigated the
