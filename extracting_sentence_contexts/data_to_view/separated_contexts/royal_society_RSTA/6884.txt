This
example should therefore present no difficulty, but it is useful as a demonstration of the
methods and formulae already given.


366 L. FOX ON THE NUMERICAL SOLUTION

Consider the mesh of figure 16, in which one-eighth of the circular plate is shown, with
symmetry about the broken lines. There are four points A, B, Cand D at which the differential
equation is satisfied, two internal fictitious points P and Q, three external fictitious points
L, M and N, and one boundary point S. Ficure 16

If the radius is taken to be 3 units, the mesh length in figure 16 is one unit, and the finite-
difference form of (B. 13) is given by
20wW,)— 8S, +25,+5,—64+A = 0,) (B.15)
A=—3(88 +68 J+... J
This equation is to be set up at each of the points A, B, C and D, the fictitious points involved
being obtained, and eliminated if necessary, by means of equations (B.11) and (B. 12).
