Skgy's remark may seem at first sight to be partially borne
out, for in many of them it is impossiþle to detect any appearance of a marked strue-
ture. In many others, on the contrary, this structure is evident enough ; and by
attention to the mode and degree of illumination, I have frequently sueceeded in
discerning the regular markings, though very faint, on fibrils which appeared before
to be decidedly cylindrical. The fact seems to be, that in these fishes the distinetion
between the light and dark points is not s0 clear as in most other cases; and their
colour being at the same time very light, the extreme tenuity of the ultimate fibrillee
does not always allow of their showing individually the markings, which are visible
enough when in juxtaposition with one another, It may therefore be coneluded,
that they form no exception to the general fact, that all the fibrillaz of voluntary
muscle possess the markings which we are now considering. Secondly, the fasciculi are not tubular, but consist of a true bundle of fibrille. Tn
the preceding observations a certain amount of proof has been offered in illustration
of this point; it having been shown that accidental wounds frequently display the
interior of the more bulky fasciculi, and demonstrate their composition by fibrillee ;

* These appearances, though in a less degree, are not uncommonly seen in disturbed fasciculi of the muscles
of other animals, and they are undoubtedly very deceptive.
