later, the equilibrium relations are comparatively
simple. Below SL the saturated solid solution is in
equilibrium with a second solid phase, and the curve
SX generally shows an increase of solubility with
temperature, but in some of the copper and silver
alloys investigated a different kind of equilibrium is
found, and the solubility decreases with temperature.
In considering the effects of valency we shall, there-
fore, deal in turn with the liquidus and solidus lines, and then with the two types
of solubility curve. Special emphasis is laid on the investigation of the series
of alloys, copper-zine, copper-gallium, and copper-germanium. and _silver-cadmium,
silver-indium, and silver-tin. In all these alloys the lattice distortion is nearly
the same and is relatively small. The fact that the solvent and solute atoms are in
the same period means that the quantum numbers of the outer electron shells of
solvent and solute are the same, whilst differences due to atomic weights or atomic
number are slight, so that everything is favourable for showing the pure valency effects
free from complicating factors.

A. The Liquidus Lines.

Kxamination of the liquidus curves shows that, with silver: or copper as solvent
when solvent and solute are in the same horizontal row of the periodic table, the atomic
compositions of alloys of a given freezing point are inversely proportional to the valencies of
