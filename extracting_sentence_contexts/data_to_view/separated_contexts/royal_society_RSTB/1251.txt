A detailed examination shows that the wall of the sporangium con
of some 4-7 layers of cells (figs. 52, 53); the number is not exactly defined, nor is
arrangement of the cells very regular ; the outermost layer develops with thicker
as in other species; the innermost is the tapetum, while between these inter
several layers of thin-walled cells, which evidently have been increased in numb
periclinal divisions (fig. 52). The development shows that this is the case, and
the difference between this and other species is due to additional periclinal di
in the wall, and not to the contribution of tissues from the sporogenous mass
tissues of the wall. The interest of this departure from the usual type of Lycopodium rests on}
parison with other forms ; it will be shown later, that in “ Brown’s Cone” of Le
strobus the wall of the sporangium is more bulky and complex in structure th
other Lepidostrobi, or in most species of Lycopodium ; it is generally known, '
that the wall of the sporangium of Ophioglossum is rather similar in structur
this of L. dichotomum; at present it will suffice to note these facts, which
dwelt upon more fully at a later page. But even in sporangia of ZL. Selag
