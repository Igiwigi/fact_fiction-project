Presumably, therefore, they are still more yellow than green, and more
green than blue. * We should therefore expect the gold glasses F, G, H, which
satisfy our condition, to be red, as in fact they are. The above values for d are certainly of the right order, but they may be somewhat
too large. If we had taken the value of p, called the Total Gold Content in Table IL.,
the corresponding values of d would have been only half those given above.
