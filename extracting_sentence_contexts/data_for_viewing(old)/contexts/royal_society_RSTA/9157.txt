photographed lines may be used in the determination of an actual relative intensity
scale. As a preliminary, a precise knowledge of the constants relating to the wedge
must be obtained.

(IIL) Determination of the Photographic Intensities of Lines.

The wedge employed was made of the so-called “ neutral-glass” which shows no
absorption of a selective character, but in which there is an increase of absorbing
power with decreasing wave-length. If an incident intensity I, falls on such a wedge
at any point, and if I is the intensity transmitted, the density at that point is
defined as the value of — log,, (I/I,). The theory of the wedge is briefly as follows,
and indicates the necessary account to be taken of the enlargement of the
photographs, and the fact that the density so defined is the most convenient form of
specification for future calculations.

If p, is the “ coefficient of extinction” of the glass for light of wave-length A, it is
such that light of intensity I, falling on a thickness y of glass, is reduced during
transmission to I,, where i

I, = Te-™

this law being equivalent to an exponential one. If « is the angle of the wedge, and
x the distance from the thin end, y=xtana and the complete length of wedge
being J, the intensity ratio for the complete wedge is
