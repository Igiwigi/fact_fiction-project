A computational method can be obtained by first lifting the
coefficients of F from Fy to a field of characteristic 0. To do so, choose an algebraic extension
K of Q such that K becomes isomorphic to F, when reduced modulo 2, and choose any lifting
Fo(x) =40,nx" + aon—1x"—+ +--+ 49, with coefficients in K such that Fo = F (mod 2). If the roots
of Fo in the algebraic closure are 191,...,9, (such that 7; =1; (mod 2)) we have disc Fy =
ag Tigi, — r9j)°- Define similarly disc;Fo = ag", 7 Tigjo,i + r0j)°- Note that disc,Fo is a
symmetric polynomial in the roots of Fo, and therefore an integral polynomial in the coefficients
of Fo—in fact, it is the square of such a polynomial. Furthermore, it is clear that disc Fy =
disc; Fo (mod 4), as polynomials in either the roots or coefficients. Therefore, the expression
(Fo) = (disc;F9 — disc Fo)/4 is also an integral polynomial in the coefficients of Fo.
