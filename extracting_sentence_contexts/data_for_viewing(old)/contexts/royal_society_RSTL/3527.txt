Feeling, from this discordance of opinion, that there was no absolute test, or at least
one which was not open to cavil, I thought to try a comparison of the uterine nerves
with those that undeniably belonged to the ganglionic system. I traced, therefore,
some neryes upon the surface of the stomach, up to the great ganglion that gave
them origin; and I selected some also from the small intestine. These I submitted
to the same microscopical power, and under the same circumstances of light, and
pressure, and medium.

In all of these I observed the tabular part filled with granular matter, and similarly
collected in minute masses.

I also observed that each tube was surrounded by the minute serpentine threads
before described. In fact so closely did they agree, in every particular, with the ap-
pearances presented by the uterine nerves, that it would have been impossi√æle to di-
stinguish the one from the other.

Thus by comparing the unknown with the known, despite the want of any abso-
Jute test, I feel perfectly satisfied of the true nervous character of the very beautiful
plexuses you have $0 patiently and with 80 much labour developed.

Adwmitting then this intricate structure to be really nervous, it is a matter of no
marvyel that they increase in size during pregnancy. It would indeed be wonderful
if the nerves alone remained stationary, while the muscular and cellular, the serous
and mucous, and the vascular tissues increased, as it is notorious those structures of
the uterns do during the period of child-hearing.
