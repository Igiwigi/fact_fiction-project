The elastic and other characteristics of ordinary matter, including its viscous rela-
tions, are on the other hand a direct consequence of its molecular constitution, in
combination with the law of material energy which is itself a consequence of the
fact that the energies of the atoms are wholly located in the surrounding simple
continuous ether and are thus functions of their mutual configurations. In this way
we come round again to an order of procedure similar to that by which Cavcny
and Poisson originally based the elastic relations of material bodies on the mutual
actions of their constituent molecules. Consider any two portions of matter which have a potential-energy function
depending, as above explained, on their mutual configuration alone, the material
movements being thus comparatively slow compared with the velocity of radiation ;
any displacement of them as a single rigid system, whether translational or rota-
tional, can involve no expenditure of work ; hence the resultant forcive exerted by
the first system on the second must statically equilibrate that exerted by the second
system on the first, these forcives must in fact be equal and opposite wrenches on a
common axis; and the energy principle thus invoives the principle of the balance of
action and reaction, in its most general form. This stress, between two molecules,
is usually sensible only at molecular range; hence the action of the surrounding
parts on a portion of a solid body is practically made up of tractions exerted over
the interface between them. Further, since rotation of the body without deformation
cannot alter the potential energy of mutual configuration of the molecules, it follows
that for a rectangular element of ordinary solid matter the tangential components of
these tractions must be self-conjugate, as they are taken to be in the ordinary
theory of elasticity.
