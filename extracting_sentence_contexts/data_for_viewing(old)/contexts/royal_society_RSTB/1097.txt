were concerned, and, instead of resting on the pads of its posterior paws, it reste 0
the whole of that part of the limb included between the ankle and digits,in
scraped the hind legs along the ground as it walked. -
Inco-ordination.—Unsteadiness of the head, increased on attempts at olusn
movements of all kinds, was present. Inco-ordination did not show itself ina
lateral reeling, as in the case of unilateral lesions of the cerebellum, but, a't
animal made attempts to walk, each succeeding step taken with the fore m
resulted in their being raised higher and higher from the ground, and onest
followed another before the limb had reached the ground, the animal as itve
attempting to find solidity in mid air, at an increasingly elevated level, until thi
part of its body is raised so high that the dog falls backwards. When the anial
going through this performance, it reminds one much more of a performing hors
circus than of a normal dog walking on its hind limbs alone, owing to the fact tat
great a part of the posterior limb rests on the ground, whereas a normal d iki
on its hind legs alone rests on the pads of its paws, without touching the
any other part of its limbs. :
Rotation movements were not 0
a few hours after the operation, and were slight. ’
Sensory Phenomena.—There is blunting of sensibility of all the extremities
but the anterior extremities recover before the posterior, which, however,
no sign of anesthesia at the end of a week.
Reflexes.—Rigidity of the extremities was slight, and the tendon refi
slightly increased.
