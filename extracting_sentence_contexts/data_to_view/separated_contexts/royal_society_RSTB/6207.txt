The large ventral stolonic vessel, in fact, no longer
exists. So that any process of budding among these families that there may be is by
the nature of the individual precluded from involving a post-abdomen, epicardial
epithelium or vascular septum. Budding, in fact, in the only family with that faculty
in the Stolidobranchiata is without doubt a re-acquirement and is markedly different
from any of those methods so far described. At the same time among the Styelidae
and the subfamily Botryllidae the mode of budding is uniform and yet so different
from other types that the conclusion is unavoidable that the re-acquisition has
occurred but once only. The differences within the family are slight and concern for the most part rate
of budding, length of stolons, etc., which while virtually without significance do
have a very marked influence on the appearance of the colony as a whole and on
the size of its constituent zooids.
