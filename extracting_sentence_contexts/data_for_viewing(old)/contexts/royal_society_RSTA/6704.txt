consists of a number of high polymeric chains, permanently cross-linked at a certain number
of junction-points along their length, to form a network. The segment of any chain between
two consecutive junction-points along the chain possesses a large number of rotational
degrees of freedom, so that if the two junction-points are considered fixed, the segment can
take up a large number of possible geometrical configurations under the influence of its

thermal motion. The entropy of a segment, for any specified positions of its terminating
junction-points, is considered to be proportional to the logarithm of the volume of the
rotation-configurational phase-space which it fills. The stored elastic energy of the deformed
rubber arises from the fact that the average entropy of the segments in the deformed state
is smaller than that in the undeformed state. A review of the general physical basis of this
theory has been given by Treloar (1943) and, more recently, by Flory (1944).

In applying this model of the mechanism of high-elasticity, Wall (1942, 6) has assumed
that all the chain segments are of equal lengths and that the material is incompressible.

The assumption of incompressibility will be justified if the strain produced by a pure
hydrostatic pressure is small compared with that produced by a normal or tangential
traction of equal magnitude. Measurements on the compressibility of rubbers, by Holt &
McPherson (1937), bear out this assumption. It will, of course, be generally true for any
highly elastic material which is neither cellular nor porous. Certain further plausible
assumptions are also made in order to make the problem tractable to calculation. Flory &
