For NIF, the peak intensity of the radiation field
is expected to reach of order 107° Wem~?, whereas for pure deuterium burning capsules the
intensity would be greater than 10?* Wcm~?. Such high intensities potentially allow experimental
access to several areas of physics that can either not otherwise be accessed or can only be accessed
on other international facilities.

— The study of photoionized plasmas of uniquely high photoionization parameter relevant
to the understanding of X-ray spectra from compact objects [27,28].

— The study of double-Compton scattering of relevance to the generation of the Cosmic
Microwave Background in the early Universe [3,29].

— The study of the Breit-Wheeler process and photon-photon scattering of relevance to the
investigation of physics beyond the Standard Model [30].

— The study of extreme-field quantum electrodynamics such as the thermal Schwinger
process [31]. In particular, both Bremsstrahlung and double Compton scattering are responsible for the fact
that the cosmic microwave background (CMB) is an almost perfect black-body, by providing
absorption and emission of photons, rather than scattering by the Compton process. Double
Compton scattering is faster than Bremsstrahlung and the rates put a constraint on the injection
of photons into the early Universe by a variety of possible processes, such as decay of primordial
black holes and decay of primordial particles. More generally, as experiments like CMB-S4 and the
Simons Observatory come online, the need to understand CMB spectral distortions is becoming
more important [32]—a burning plasma may be the only way to understand much of the physics
behind these observations.
