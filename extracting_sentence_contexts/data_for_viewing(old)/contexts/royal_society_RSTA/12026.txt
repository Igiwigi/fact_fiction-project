Ferro-manganese yielded a very fine spectrum after an exposure varying from 15
to 30 minutes, better in fact than any compound of that substance. It may thus be
generally stated that manganese alloys containing iron yield a more distinctive
spectrum of manganese than any compound containing the same proportion of that
element. (See the upper spectra on Plate 14.)

Metallic manganese, deposited on platinum by the electrolysis of a perfectly pure
solution of the chloride, was heated in the oxyhydrogen flame for half-an-hour and its
spectrum photographed.

Pure manganic oxide was prepared from a solution of potassium permanganate by
the action of alcohol and a small quantity of sulphurous acid. The precipitated
oxide, washed and ignited, was heated on a support of kyanite in the flame of
the oxyhydrogen blow-pipe for an hour and 20 minutes. It will be seen that as
