208 DR. W. PAGE MAY ON THE SEGMENTAL REPRESENTATION

For the particular function with which we are now concerned (sensori-motor reflex)
it seems certain that the path along which the impulses pass, as evidenced by move-
ment elicited in stimulating a certain posterior root, is directed towards a point
below the level of that posterior root, and not, as we might suppose, chiefly in the
same segment, or even above the level at which the posterior root ioins the cord. The proof of this new conclusion is afforded by the following facts :--

Stimulation of the 3rd posterior lumbar root in the dog produces slow, but dis-
tinct, flexion and adduction of the hip and flexion of the knee; yet stimulation of the
corresponding anterior or 3rd root, so far as I was able to observe in the thirty-five
dogs experimented on, never produced movement in the lower limb; and this is all
the more remarkable because a small branch is given off from the 3rd anterior root
or nerve to the 4th anterior nerve, which latter supplies directly various muscles
of the lower limb, Also stimulation of the 2nd anterior lumbar roots gave no
movement in the lower limb, as one would expect; yet stimulation of the 2nd
posterior lumbar root gave always distinct slight flexion of the hip and knee. Thus
certainly for this segment it is clear that the posterior root is in relation with
efferent paths at least two segments below its attachment to the cord. Again, if, in stimulating any given posterior lumbar root, movement resulted in
the lower limb, one or more of the anterior lumbar roots were then divided in various
sequences, with the result that certain differences of movement could be observed.
