lying against the wall and also occasionally in the region of the dorsal ciliated tract
(dct.). Generally speaking, the effect of fixation seems to be to cause material lying
against the wall to shrink away into the lumen, and probably some of the material
seen in the lumen in these sections would be close to the epithelial cells in the living
animal; this is, in fact, seen in other sets of sections. However, after allowing for such
changes in position induced by fixation, the sections illustrated provide a good cor-
roboration of the general account of the movement of food and secretions postulated
above. Some of the minor details must necessarily be a little speculative; the essential
factors in the present argument are, however, a separation of fine particles from the
rotating cord and their transmission backwards by means of the dorsal tract and the
ciliation of the walls over the absorptive areas, and for this there seems to be confirma-
tion both in the evidence provided by fresh tissue and that provided by serial sections.
