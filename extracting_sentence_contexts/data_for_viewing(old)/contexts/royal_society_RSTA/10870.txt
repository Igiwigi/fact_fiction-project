We then followed the stream down the valley, along a path so seldom used that it
was almost obliterated by the dense growth of calumet and razor grasses, through which
we waded up to our necks. The whole of this valley contained hot springs charged
with sulphurous gases: lateral streams entered the main one—some cool, clear, and
potable ; others hot, dirty, and laden with sulphur. After walking rather more than
half a mile, we turned to the left up a side valley, and, crossing a small ridge, we came
to the famous boiling lake.

It is a cup-shaped depression, a bowl nearly circular in outline, perhaps 100 yards
across, with high bare walls of weathered tuff surrounding it. At the east and west
sides the bowl has two deep notches in its margin. Through these, two small
streams enter on the west—one pure and cool, the other sulphurous ; and on the east
the effluent stream emerges. It is, in fact, an enlargement of part of the channel
produced by the action of a powerful soufritre, which has decomposed the rocks
around its orifice, and produced a funnel-shaped cavity through which the stream
flows, and out of which it washes all the finer mud due to the churning of the water
by the uprising steam. The north and south walls are perhaps 50 feet high, and
show the effects of the acids generated by the oxidation of the hydrogen sulphide in
their crumbling decayed surfaces,

The pool was full of milky, greenish water, boiling furiously towards its centre,
where it was seething like a gigantic caldron. The smell was oppressive, especially
when the wind blew towards us and carried with it the steam and gases. We
found that the only danger was that of being poisoned by the sulphuretted
hydrogen, and this could only take place in the bottom of the depression, where
