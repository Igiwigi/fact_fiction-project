In general, it can be shown* that concentric rings are also to be expected,
just as in the familiar “ rings and cross ” of a plate of uniaxial crystal in convergent
light, and when such rings can be observed it is easy to determine if the uniaxial

crystal fibres are optically positive or negative. With particles of the size met with
in the silver films, viz., of the order of 1 » across, such rings cannot be resolved. There is, in fact, no evidence that the silver particles are complete spherulites ; an
optical figure such as that observed would be produced by a conical section of a
spherulite, having its apex on the glass surface, for instance, in a way recalling a
single “ set’ in a smectic liquid-crystal layer ; or by a half of a complete sphere. It appears, however, that an arrangement of rod-like units radiating from a centre
would account for our observations, these rods were birefringent. Suggestions as
to how this may be possible with a substance normally arranged in a cubic lattice
will be made when the results are discussed.
