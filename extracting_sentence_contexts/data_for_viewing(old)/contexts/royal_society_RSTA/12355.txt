Genay, the coast of Mentone, and in the fissures of Nice and Cette, of which this
deposit at Gibraltar is a counterpart on a larger scale. After the final rise of the
land the caves and open spaces left in the fissures became the resort of the more
recent wild animals and of Neolithic Man.

On this view the superficial deposits would be comprised in three stages or epochs,
First and oldest, that of the later Raised Beaches and Quaternary Bone-caves.
Second, that of the Breccia on the slopes and in the Ossiferous fissures (or Rubble-
drifts), Third, and latest, that of the Neolithic caves, '

T have dwelt thus long on Gibraltar not only on account of the extensive scale on ~
which the phenomena are exhibited, but also because the other explanations of the
facts being by geologists of high authority and of competent local experience, I did
not deem it prudent to advance further on what is still debateable ground, and leave, —
without an attempt to capture, so important a position in the rear. We can pass
more rapidly over Italy and some of the Mediterranean Islands. ;

Corsica.—It would seem that there are here several Raised Beaches some of which
attain a considerable height.* The lowest of them is from 15 to 20 feet above the
sea-level, and contains species of shells now living on the coast. To the north of
Bastia stretches the promontory of Cape Corso, formed by a mountain range
from 2000 to 3000 feet high and intersected by transverse valleys. Fringing this
promontory on the eastern side, are numerous quarries of limestone of Cretaceous
