To see the magnetic field evolution, equation (2.12) can be substituted into the Maxwell equation
3:B = —V x E. Using the ideal gas equation of state pe =1eTe, the pressure gradient term yields


the Biermann battery magnetic source term

The resistive term can be simplified using the identity —V x (nV x B) = noV2B — Ving x (V x
B) with V.B = 0. The thermoelectric term can be simplified with the same identity, along with the
fact that V x VT, =0. The final form of the induction equation is therefore composed only of an advection term, a
diffusion term, the resistivity gradient term and two source terms that are still active even when

The first term causes advection of the magnetic field at velocity ug, although it has no effect when
the advection is along the field line. The field advection velocity is given by

It is now clear that the sole effect of the anisotropic | and \ extended-MHD terms is to alter
the magnetic field advection velocity.
