The lightest marked female weighed 23 g; those below this weight were probably
all young. In August the majority of both sexes over 22:2 g had either been marked in May or
June, and only one of them was that seasonâ€™s young. The June-marked young, in fact,
had almost all disappeared, as shown by the comparative number of recaptures in table 12. Thus out of forty-eight adults released in June twenty-five were retaken in August and
fourteen in September; out of twenty-three young released in June only two were retaken
in August; none in September. The two young recaptured in August weighed 24-5 g (2)
and 17-5 g ($); another female, first recaptured in February, weighed 17 g.
