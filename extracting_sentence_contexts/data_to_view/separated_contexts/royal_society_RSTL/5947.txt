All I wish to do is to give a statement, as explicit and
= acenrate as T can, of the facts connected with the sensations of myself and others simi-
Slarly situated, leaving these facts to be discussed by others more competent to deal with
-2 them. 2 And as far as the correct determination of these facts is concerned, it seems to me
2 that we, the colour-blind, are really in a better position for investigating their nature
F than the normal-eyed. & Such an investigation must be based entirely on a comparison of the impressions
2 experienced respectively by two distinct classes of individuals. The normal-eyed person
& experiences one set of sensations, the colour-blind person a set entirely different ; neither
VB ean see what the other sees; and each must therefore draw his ideas of the other's
s impressions solely from the description communicated to him.
