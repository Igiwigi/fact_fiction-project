This section focuses on the design of the PWM-based perceptron, including the fundamental
theories, the circuits of its constituent parts, methods of PWM-based arithmetic, leading to the
construction of NNs. The design methods form the basis of extensive analysis supporting the
validation of the perceptrons integrated in a NN.

A perceptron capable of voltage and frequency elasticity may be constructed by exploiting
the fact that relative temporal properties, such as a PWM’s duty cycle, are resilient to voltage
and frequency variations. As the supply voltage reduces, any oscillatory activity, such as a clock
signal, may show a reduced amplitude and reduced frequency. However, the ratio between the
time within a period when the clock signal is high and the time within a period when the clock
signal is low stays the same as both would increase at the same rate.

Our method, therefore, is dedicated to finding ways of exploiting this fact by transferring
computation from the digital domain, which is affected by voltage and frequency variations, to
the relative temporal domain, which is not. This means making use of PWM-based techniques.
