In the practical problem of sampling material with a density distribution of which the
underlying form is a normal curve, there will be a further component of variation due to
the divergence of the actual density distribution from the hypothetical infinite distribution.
The nature of this divergence will depend on the material, but in the case in which the
material is composed of separate units each of which is normally and independently dis-
tributed about a fixed point, the variance due to this cause can be easily assessed.

If there are N units in the material, and a fraction / of the whole range of the distribution
is sampled, the variance of the number n falling in the sampled parts of the range will be
made up of two parts, that due to the sampling variance of the total ‘normal’ probability
P attributable to the sampled part of the range, and that due to the divergence of the actual
density within the sampled part of the range from the ‘normal’ density. This latter will be
given by a binomial distribution. We shall in fact have

V(n) = N2V(P)+P(1—P) N.

The expectation of P is f, and its variance for the various methods of sampling is given in
percentage terms by the results already obtained. If N = 1000 and f= 7, for example,
taking mean value, we have
P(i—P)N= 90-0
Systematic sample at spacing o == 0:0)
N?V(P) }Random sample, 1 from each block of ¢ = 111-9
Random sample, 2 from each block of 27 = 390-6

Thus in this case the use of a systematic sample, instead of a random sample with one
