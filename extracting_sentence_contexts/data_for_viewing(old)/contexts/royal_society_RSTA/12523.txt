4 Cygni did not reach so high a temperature as Nova Coron ; for, whereas the latter
te star was bluish-white at its brightest and hottest stage, Nova Cygni was of a golden
& yellow. This fact is also borne out by the spectroscopic observations of the two
5 Stars.

4 The purple tinge noted by Corgtanp on January 8 was, no doubt, produced by
& the addition of the blue or bluish-green light of the sparser regions to the reddish
= light of the denser parts of the swarm.

= Referring to these observations of colour, Dr. Lousz remarks: “ The spectroscope
g gives the desired explanation. It showed that the continuous spectrum, which was
& at first exceedingly bright, gradually became pale, until at last scarcely anything but
8 bright lines could be seen. This succession of appearances, as seen in both TycHo’s
& and Scumipr’s stars, and which will probably occur in all stars of a similar kind,
