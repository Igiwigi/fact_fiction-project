Superficially, therefore, it corresponds to just half the total length of the
hemisphere. It takes the usual course, 7.e., mesialwards, until just before reaching
the sulcus parieto-occipitalis (pars externus), when it runs parallel to the sagittal
plane until opposite the (transverse) plane of the centre of the horizontal limb of the
suleus calearinus, when it turns downwards. Owing to the fact that all its parts, 7.e., suleus postcentralis inferior, ramus
horizontalis and ramus occipitalis, are all confluent, there is no definite sulcus
transversus present, and the sulcus is not bridged at any point, at least by any gyrus
reaching up to 10 mm. of the surface. Ramus mesialis.—This is present as a short sulcus terminating by a T-shaped end
on the margin. Sulcus vetrocentralis superior.—This subordinate suleus subdivides the parietal
lobule into an anterior and posterior half.
