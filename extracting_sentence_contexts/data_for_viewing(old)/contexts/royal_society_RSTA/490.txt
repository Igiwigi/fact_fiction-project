that occurs during this layer-by-layer growth [35]. These RHEED oscillations provide an in situ

method of monitoring the progress of the growth of ultrathin films with exquisite precision. Note, 3
though, that as growth proceeds the oscillations damp in amplitude, attributed to an increased :B
roughening due to nucleation of new layers on the islands of incomplete layers; the number of s

oscillations clearly visible during growth varies from fewer than 10 to many tens depending on
the system being studied and the conditions of growth, but a smooth surface can generally be
restored by annealing, allowing strong oscillations to be recovered in subsequent growth. Note
that in the growth of III-V compounds, such as GaAs, the MBE technique exploits the fact that the
sticking factor of the different elemental beams (As2 or As4 and Ga) depends on the composition

of the surface, such that the correct stoichiometry is achieved without having to set the fluxes of : 8
the two beams to exactly the same arrival rate. In the case of Si MBE, it is possible to use true Dos
molecular beams, most notably exploiting the pyrolysis of silane (SiH4) or disilane (SizHg) at the :=
surface, although it is now more common to use vacuum evaporation of solid silicon such that : Sy
the ‘molecular’ beam is actually atomic Si. 2

The second important development has been the increasing use of computational modelling aed
of crystal growth using Monte Carlo methods, a possibility that did not exist at the time of 22
BCF due to the lack of suitable computational resources. Such calculations are very intensive : Ss
