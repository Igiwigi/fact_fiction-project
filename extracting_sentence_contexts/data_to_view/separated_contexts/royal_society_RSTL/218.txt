The highest amount
of copper, (that given by FonTana,) does not exceed66 per
cent. and is far short of the real quantity. The remainder, as
he $tates, consists of water, and of pure and fixed airs. The
difference in the results I had obtained, together with some new
facts, which I had occasion to observe during my experiments,
induces me to treat the subject at some length; referring for its
external characters, to those mineralogists above mentioned,
who have amply described the ore, and confining myself entirely
to its chymical analysis, and some analogous experiments.

* He merely poured muriatic acid upon the ore; and, as it was entirely dissolved,
without effervescence, concluded it to be an oxide, and not a carbonate; of copper,


the Arseniates of Copper, and of Tron. 229

One hundred: parts of very pure and regularly crystallized
red copper ore were reduced to a fine powder, and dissolved,
without the assistance of heat, in nitric acid. During the operation, a very violent effervescence, accom-
panied by a disengagement of nitrous gas, unusually-copious
and rapid, took place. When these phenomena had subsided,
the solution was blue, like every other nitrate of copper; and
the ore had entirely disappeared.
