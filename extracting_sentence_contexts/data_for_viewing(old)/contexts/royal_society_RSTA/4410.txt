9. Conclusion

Communication systems are at a point of transition, an inevitable juncture brought about by
decades of exponential capacity growth. Energy efficiency is essential for moving forward. The
end to historical scaling in optical systems, the fibre capacity crunch, is bringing about a shift
to growth through parallelism, which can only be supported through exponential improvements
in energy efficiency. In fact, multiple Internet technologies, having undergone similar growth,
are facing related scaling challenges, including electrical interconnects and mobile systems.
Improving the energy efficiency of optics can enable the use of optics in these energy-constrained
network edges. Efficiency gains in electronics will further benefit optical systems creating
synergistic gains and open energy and cost-sensitive applications to optical technologies. The
high capacities in data centres provide a potential model for growing metro area networks,
reducing reliance on core network capacity growth. Hardware integration of photonics, in
particular silicon photonics, is needed to realize high-volume, low-cost components for the metro
area. Hardware efficiency improvements together with hybrid control architectures to enable
close inter-working of electronic and optical systems promise the efficiency gains essential for
continued network scaling.
