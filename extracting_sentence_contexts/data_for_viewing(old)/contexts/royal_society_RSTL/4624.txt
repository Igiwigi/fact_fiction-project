a curve surface, it is till more s0 of a plane surface ; all whose particles are clearly
equidistant from the ray's original path, and the particles after the first are in con-
8equence of that first particle's flexion nearer the bent ray, at least in the case of in-
flexion. But it is to be observed, moreover, that in the experiment with two oppo-
site edges, inflexion enters as well as deflexion, and consequently this demonstration,
founded on the exact equality of the fringes made by compound double edges, appears
to be conclusive. For it must be observed that this experiment of the different edges
and surfaces, plane and curve, having precisely the same action, is identical with the
former experiment of two edges heing placed one behind the other, and the second
producing no effect if placed on the same side of the ray with the first edge. These
two edges are exactly like two snccessive particles of the same surface near to which
the rays pass. Consequently the two experiments are not similar but identical ; and
thus the known fact of the edge and the back of a razor making the same fringes,
proves the polarization of the rays on one side. Thus the proposition is proved as to
polarization.

Exp. 3. The proposition is further demonstrated, as regards disposition, in the
clearest manner by observing the effect of two bodies, as edges, whether placed di-
rectly opposite to each other while the rays pass between them $80 near as to be bent,
or placed one behind the other but on opposite sides of the rays. Suppose the edges
directly opposite one to the other, and snppose there is no disposition of the rays to
be more easily bent by the one edge in consequence of the other edge's action. Then
the breadth and distension and removal of the fringes caused by the two edges acting
jointly, would be in proportion to the sum of the two separate actions. Suppose that
one edge deflects and the other inflects, and suppose that inflexion and deflexion are
