40 grains in two ounces and a half of water
produced a visible effect in two hours and a quarter, and a still more marked effect in
four hours and three quarters. The effect continued to be perceptible for 94 hours
after the medicine was taken. As compared with the previous experiments, though the quantity taken appears to
have been more, the effects seem not to have been 80 strongly marked ; but in fact
less of the base was taken in the last than in the previous set of experiments, for

30 grains of chloride of calcium are equivalent to 15'1 grains of lime,

40 grains of sulphate of magnesia are equivalent to 13'6 grains of magnesia. As sulphate of magnesia is one cause of increase in the amount of earthy phosphates
precipitated by ammonia, and as this alt also interferes in analyses regarding the
quantity of sulphuric acid which is thrown out of the system, any means of knowing
when it has been given as a medicine may be valuable. Most frequently it is pre-
scribed with infusion of senna, which communicates a greenish yellow colour to the
urine, This colouring matter, whether it has passed through the system or not, I
find has the property of becoming of a deep red on the addition of an excess of any
alkali, though it is most bright with ammonia.
