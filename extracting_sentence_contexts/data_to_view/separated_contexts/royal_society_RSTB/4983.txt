218 JOHN WALTON ON CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE

Isolated fructifications of Telangium consist of synangia or of seed-cupules attached to
naked rachises, which exhibit ‘‘ the characteristic dichotomisation of the fructifying

of the pinne attached to this particular frond show this type of branching is another
argument against supposing them to be fertile divisions of the frond.
