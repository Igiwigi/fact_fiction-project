different species.

In a memoir* recently published, M. QuaTREFaGts has re-traversed the ground first
opened by Mriing-Epwarps. M. QuaTREFAces confirms, without a single exception,
the conclusions at which his colleague had previously arrived. Historic truth
demands it to be stated that M. QuaTREFacss, in the memoir cited, has improved
very little upon the original description of MiLxz-Epwass, and in that little he has
become entangled in error.

In the Arenicole and Punice he describes proboscidian and branchial hearts,
which do not exist. M. QuaTREraGes Seems to have doubtfully recognised the
general fact of the fluidity of the blood-proper of the Annelida. He cites however in
the same paragraph such striking exceptions to this fact, that he gives no proofs
whatever of having mentally realized the /aw which demands that the true-blood of
the Annelida s/hould be invariably fluid, non-corpusculated, because in this class the
office which devolves upon the floating cells is performed in the chylaqueous fluid,
where alone such cells exist. This remarkable principle, which literally divides the
nutritious fluid into two parts, upon one of which the corpuscular agency devolves,
upon the other the more special duties of solid nutrition, seems not in the Jeast degree,
at any time, to have entered the mind of M. QUATREFAGES.
