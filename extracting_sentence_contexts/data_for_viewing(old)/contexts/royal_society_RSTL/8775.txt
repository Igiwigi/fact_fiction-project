Ix a paper read before the Royal Society, May 1874, I pointed out that the upward
diminution of temperature in the atmosphere (known to exist under certain circum-
stances) must refract and give an upward direction to the rays of sound which would
otherwise proceed horizontally; and it was suggested that this might be the cause
of the obseryed difference in the distinctness with which similar sounds are heard on
different occasions, particularly the very marked advantage which night has over day
in this respect. At the time at which that paper was written no direct experiments or
observations had been made to verify the truth of this suggestion, and therefore its
probability rested on its reasonableness. Since that time, however, I have carried out
a series of obseryations and experiments which, although far from complete, throw some
light on the subject, besides revealing some remarkable facts. I hope to be able to
continue the investigation ; but since its nature is such as to render the chance of bringing
it to any thing like a final conclusion very uncertain, it seems to me that it may be
well to publish an account of what has been already done; and this is the object of the
present, communication.

In order to render the object of the various experiments clear, it may be well to
recapitulate here ome of the theoretical considerations previously explained. It will be
remembered that the idea that the variations of temperature would cause refraction of
sound occurred to me while making experiments on the effect of wind upon sound, from
which it was shown that when sound proceeds in a direction contrary to that of the
wind, it is not, as had been thought, destroyed or stopped by the wind, but that it is
lifted, and that at sufficiently high elevations it can be heard to as great distances as in
