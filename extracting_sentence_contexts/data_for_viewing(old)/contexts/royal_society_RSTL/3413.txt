respondence in this respect, between the striz on the fasciculus and the markings on
the fibrillze, a correspondence which is 80 exact, that it is reasonable to believe the
appearance must be the result of the same cause in each condition ; and either that
the striazz must be formed by the coaptation of the markings on neighbouring fibrillz,
or that these markings must be impressions received from the investing striz, as from
a distinct and independent stracture. Which of these alternatives is the correct one,
I shall now attempt to show.

It is to be observed, that the latter supposition entails one of two consequences
worthy of being traced ; either those filaments only can receive markings which are
at the surface of the fasciculus, or, if it be proved that all are marked, all must be at
the surface, and the fasciculus must be of the nature of a tube. But both snch con-
s8equences would be at yariance with fact ; for there will be no difficulty in proving all
the fibrillaz of a fasciculus to be thus marked, and the fasciculi to be not tubular, but
composed of a solid bundle of fibrille.

First, all the fibrille are marked. If a muscle that has been macerated in a cool
place be examined, the fibrillze will generally be found to fall readily asunder, and
float in great numbers about the field of the microscope ; all these fibrille present the
dark and light spaces alluded to; there are none without them. Under the same
cireumstances fasciculi will offer themselves in a variety of conditions, partially sepa-
rated into their elementary fibrillee, either at their extremities or centres; and
wherever the fibrillaz can be clearly distinguished, where their texture has not been
destroyed by the macerating process, they will exhibit these alternate dark and light
points with more or less distinctness. This appearance is often particularly well dis-
