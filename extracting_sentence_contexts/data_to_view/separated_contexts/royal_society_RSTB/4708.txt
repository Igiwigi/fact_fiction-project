It was attempted to make up this deficiency with
protozoal cultures reared in the laboratory, but without success. The micro-organisms
at first consisted of various flagellates and ciliates as well as bacteria, but subsequently
the bacteria only were evident and these in far fewer numbers. The youngest stages were very easy to obtain, despite the fact that they were exceed-
ingly minute, as they always collected at the surface of the water at the side of the vessel
nearest the light. This may have indicated a positive phototropism in the larve, as has
been recorded in the case of other Phyllopoda. However, it must be borne in mind that
the larvae may have gathered in the region where the food was most plentiful, the photo-
tropism being exhibited by the food organisms rather than the larvee.
