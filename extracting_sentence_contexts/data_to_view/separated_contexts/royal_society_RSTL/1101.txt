20. Let us next consider the equations (u) and (v). The
latter does not involve the radii of the lenses, but only their
powers, being in fact when developed. o=(2n+3)L+(2n'+3)L'+(2n"+3) L'+ &c.; (2) In a double object-glass, this equation will be incompatible
with the equation ozp L+p' L' expressing the condition of
achromaticity, and must of course be sacrificed, the latter
being of paramount importance.
