108 PROFESSOR H. G. SEELEY ON THE STRUCTURE, ORGANIZATION,

Avian affinities of certain Dinosaurs, and is about as complete as that evidence was
when the conclusion was first enunciated by Professor Huxtry. If it is legitimate
to infer from certain characters of the pelvis and hind-limb of Iguanodon, combined
with less marked resemblances to Birds in certain vertebral and cranial characters,
that the Dinosauria and Birds are parallel offshoots from a common stock, then
it must similarly follow, from the correspondence with the Mammalia shown by
Pareiasaurus and its allies, that those groups also are parallel offshoots from a
common ancestral type. The interest of this conclusion appears to be augmented by
the fact that reasons have already been adduced for believing that most, if not all, of
the Reptilian orders have an inheritance of Labyrinthodont characters, and are
therefore derived from Amphibia; so that the Mammalia and Reptilia would thus
appear to have a common origin, to which Pareiasaurus approaches nearer than
any animal hitherto known.
