Another very convenient arrangement for showing the phenomenon of relief-phos-

i one end. The introduction of an air-spark will fill the remaining portion of the tube
' with a luminous discharge or haze (according to the degree of exhanstion), which is in

this will be in a positive unipolar discharge and it will give relief-
-phosphorescence
all the other phenomena of positive intermittence.

The phenomenon of relief-phosphorescence supplies us with a very convenient met;
of determining experimentally the laws that govern the production of these molecular
