The experiments were again put an end to by a flaw in the insulation, which was
made on attempting to carry the pressure to a greater extent, and therefore the final
result can only be considered as very roughly correct. Fortunately, however, there is
a means of testing approximately the accuracy of this result, as ib was found that at
the temperature of the room (about 4* C.) the heat cansed by the compression of the
metal exactly balanced the effect of the pressure on the wire—s0 exactly, indeed, that
even when pressures of 3000 Ibs. per square inch were employed, the instant after the
removal of the pressure there was no change whatever mn the resistance, but in a few
econds afterwards the resistance began to. decrease, and apparently attained a
minimum in about half an hour. About this fact there can be no doubt, as it was
repeated geveral times and with several different pressures. Now-the change of tem-
