The day-to-day variations of total
whistler activity exhibit a small but definite positive correlation with magnetic disturbance
The variations of the dispersion correlate with those of the critical frequency of the /, layer.

PART 2. A THEORY OF WHISTLING ATMOSPHERICS
10. PRELIMINARY REMARKS
The main facts of observation concerning the whistling atmospherics have been described
in the first part of this paper, and are summarized above in its final paragraph. We have
now to consider the problem of their origin. Previously a theory of whistlers had been developed by Eckersley (1935) following a
suggestion of Barkhausen (1930).
