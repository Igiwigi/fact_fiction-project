Hereto comes another fact which I have observed,
viz., that the cornea is much larger in those animals which have a divergence of more
than 50° or 60°. In addition, these animals have nearly spherical lenses. Evidently
these latter facts are of much greater importance than the size of the pupil, as we
know by analogy with a camera, that the size of the stop does not affect the field or
angle of view, which is solely dependent on the shape of the lenses in the combina-

tion, and their proximity to each other, and to the diaphragm. It is evident that the
increased size of the cornea will allow rays of much greater obliquity to be refracted
into the eye, and a spherical lens will diminish the distortion produced by the focus of
‘those oblique rays, and that all the more, since the image is received upon a surface
nearly equidistant from the nodal points.
