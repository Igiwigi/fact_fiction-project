It is thus useful to speculate about the origin of the
VLSM. A mechanism that is conjectured by Balakumar & Adrian (2007) relates
to the autogeneration and alignment of hairpin-vortex packets. This view mus
be reconciled with the fact that VLSM is sometimes deduced to be of the order o
the length of the apparatus itself (Ganapathisubramani et al. 2006). Further speculations are varied. One suggestion has been that the VLSM may
be related to large-scale pressure fluctuations in experimental facilities.
