this is the important variable), in fact the line integral of the magnetic field from x=0 to 100
microns is reduced by 20% for f = 0.15 compared to f = 0.05.

Finally we note that a situation similar to this 2D simulation set-up may be realizable
experimentally by inducing a density jump in a gas jet. This could be achieved by overlapping
two gas jets of differing pressure or by the presence of an obstacle in the gas jet (although the
latter would result in a shock).

4. Discussion

Here we have shown that two kinetic effects on the Biermann battery become important when the
electron mean free path can no longer be considered small compared to the electron temperature
gradient. This is due to the fact that LTE breaks down in this case and the electron distribution
function is no longer Maxwellian as the transport becomes nonlocal. Firstly there is the direct
effect of the distortion of the distribution function on the electric field, which has been previously


considered [6,7]. The electric field causing the Biermann battery is given by equation (2.3) in
the general case where the distribution function is not Maxwellian. Only in the special case of
LTE where the distribution is Maxwellian is the electric field given by the more familiar form in
equation (2.4) usually employed in MHD codes. In the simulations presented in ยง3, relevant to the
conditions in inertial confinement fusion plasmas, this direct effect of the distortion of the electron
distribution reduced the peak electric field by almost 50%, in line with previous results [6].

The second, less explored kinetic effect on the Biermann battery is the indirect effect of the
