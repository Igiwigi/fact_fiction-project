was laid flat under the snake, the ends of the ribs were dis-
tinctly felt upon the palm, as the animal passed over it.

This becomes a more interesting discovery, as it constitutes
a new species of progressive motion, and one widely different
from those already known.

In the draco volans the ribs form the skeleton of the wings,
by means of which the animal flies, the five posterior ribs
being bent backwards and elongated for that purpose, s0 that
in that instance the progressive motion is performed by the
