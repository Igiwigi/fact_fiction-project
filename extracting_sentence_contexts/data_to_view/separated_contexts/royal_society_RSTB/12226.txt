We computed the Pearson correlation
between the correlation coefficients of the cell-pairs as a measure of similarity between the population activity structure across the three imaging
blocks. The mean and standard errors of the resulting Pearson correlation coefficients are shown (one-way ANOVA; ***p < 0.001). The lack of significant
difference between RESTI—RUN and REST2—RUN possibly reflected the fact that the animals were already highly experienced on the task. (6) Explained

variance was calculated as EV = (te — ReunpestaReesrirest2) /' / (1 — Ruy aesti)(1 — Rest =) , where the R-values correspond to Pearson correlation coef-

ficients in (a) [39,40]. These values were controlled against the reverse explained variance (REV). REV was obtained using the same equation, but by substituting REST2 with
REST1 epochs and vice versa.
