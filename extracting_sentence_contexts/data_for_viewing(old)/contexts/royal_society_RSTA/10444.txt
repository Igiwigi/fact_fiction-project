& where it will be seen that the values of the minimum spark potentials, for air, over
8 this large range of spark lengths vary by only 7 volts. The values for hydrogen,
g over the same large range of spark lengths, vary by only 5 volts, and those for
@ carbon dioxide by only 4 volts.
‘° These results, then, seem to establish the fact that the least spark potential
§ required to break down a gas is entirely independent of the spark length.
> It is evident, too, from figs. 3, 5 and 7, that the constancy of the minimum spark
sp potential is a necessary condition to Pascuen’s law holding for discharges at
= different electrode distances,
a R. J. Srrurr,* in his paper “ On the Least Potential Differences required to produce
5 Discharge through Gases,’ has drawn the conclusion that the minimum spark
‘8 potential for discharges in any selected gas is probably equal to the cathode fall, in
% the same gas, measured over the whole extent of the negative glow in the vacuum
@ tube. Since the cathode fall in any gas has been shown by Warsurct to be a
S constant, over a very large range of pressures, the constancy of the values obtained
= in these experiments for the least spark potential gives strong support to Srrurt's
¢ conclusion.
