the centre ring No. 9 to earth, the deflections, as we have before aid, were all positive
between 1 and 9, and all negative between 9 and 17 ; if the connexions with the
battery were made previous to the connexion of 9 to earth, and a well-formed steady
stratification produced, very little change occurred in it when 9 was connected by
me.ns of a key to earth ; in fact only a slight one in those strata, close to the earth
ring. The curves, more especially fig. 21, 8how that there is no disturbance of the
potentials in consequence of the earth connexion in the centre of the tube, but that
the whole curve is lifted or depressed 80 as to cut the axis ab thab point. The curve
(fig. 22) brings out very forcibly how far greater is the obstacle to the passage of the
discharge at the negative than at the positive electrode.
