Figure 10. Weibull plots of B3B bending strength of nanocrystalline (a) and microcrystalline (b) diamond foil, both loaded on
the GS (filled data points) as well as the NS (open data points). The NCDF shows quite similar strengths for both sides, whereas
the microcrystalline diamond foil is much weaker on the GS but much stronger on the NS. The latter can be explained by the fact
that optimization of pre-treatment in (b) leads to a higher seeding density than for the NCDF shown in (a) and fewer particle
residues (cf. figure 13).

magnitude of the structure sizes, which is very similar on the NS and on the GS of NCDF.
Larger microcrystalline crystals are therefore expected to show less strength, which is proven by
figure 10b. The coarse GS of microcrystalline diamond foil only shows a strength of approximately
2.7GPa with a Weibull modulus of 9.8. The very high strength of the seeding face, which even
exceeds the strength of NCDE, is due to the improved seeding procedure used for the samples
shown, leading to very small supergrains on the NS. The homogeneous distribution of the latter
is also demonstrated by the high Weibull modulus of 14.7.

In figure 11, the outstanding strength of NCDF is shown in comparison with conventional
