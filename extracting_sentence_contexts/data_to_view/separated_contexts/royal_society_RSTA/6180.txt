We also provide an overview of what is currently known about
missingness in black-box studies.

(a) Design of black-box studies

The PCAST (2016) report stated that empirical studies must show that a forensic method is
accurate, repeatable and reproducible [14]. However, forensic feature comparison disciplines
are difficult to evaluate empirically. This is, in part, due to the fact that they rely on subjective
decisions. In response to this complication, PCAST (2016) suggested using black-box studies to
assess the scientific validity of these disciplines. In these studies, researchers compile test sets or items for comparison.
