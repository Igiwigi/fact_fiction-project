Sfined, we may speak of a partition as being prior or posterior to another. We are
ww able to state a second restriction as follows,
= Sccond Restriction.—The combination 4”... contains only those symmetric functions
hich are of the form (partition not prior to the conjugate of 127...)

The terms excluded by the two restrictions are many of them the same, and it might
# first sight appear as if the two restrictions were identical; but this is not 80: for
Mstance, for the combination bd?, see Table VII(a), the term (41*) is excluded by the
Fat restriction, but not by the second ; and on the other hand, the term (3*1), which is
vt excluded by the first restriction, is excluded by the second restriction, as containing
Epartition 321 prior in order to 32?, which is the partition conjugate to 13?, the partition

bd. It is easy to sce why bd? does not contain the symmetric function (3*1); in fact.
& term of (31) is (£8%), which is obviously not a term of b6d*=(—Ez)(Eu3y)* ; but I

ve not investigated the general proof.

ST proceed to explain the construction of the Tables (a). 'The outside column
Sntains the symmetric functions arranged in the order before explained ; the outside or
ep. line contains the combinations of the same weight arranged as follows, viz. the
partitions taken in order from right to left are respectively conjugate to the partitions
in the outside column, taken in order from top to bottom ; in other words, each square
of the sinister diagonal corresponds to two partitions which are conjugate to each other.
It is to be noticed that the combinations taken in order, from left to right, are not in
the order in which they would be obtained by ArBogcasr's Method of Derivations from
