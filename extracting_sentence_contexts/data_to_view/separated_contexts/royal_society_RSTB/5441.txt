Kipsron does not appear to be justified in including
the fronds of Sphenopteris affinis L. & H. in the genus Telangium as there is neither
evidence of continuity between the sterile fronds and Telangium-like synangia on the
one hand nor between any fertile rachis and the sterile fronds on the other. The same
applies to Sphenopteris bifida L. & H., where nothing more definite than close association
connects any fructifications with the sterile frond. Another reasonable objection lies
in the fact that the genus T'elangium was founded by BENSON (loc. cit., p. 162) on petrified
material of Upper Carboniferous Age and probably many different families of Pterido-
sperms had microsporangiate synangia of this type. In spite of this, several species,
including those already mentioned of incrustations, have been referred to the genus
Telangium.
