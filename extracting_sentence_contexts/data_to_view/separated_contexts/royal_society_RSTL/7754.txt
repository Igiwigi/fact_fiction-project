By ome this
may be considered as a rectus sternalis with an interruption of the nature of a tendinous
* inscription;” but the appearance of the muscle agrees best with that of the sferno-cos-
talis, while a tendinous separation or interval between the rectus thoracicus and the
rectus abdominis is not uually seen in the Mammalia, In the Peccary it is composed
of two large digitations quite unlike a rectus sernalis; and in the Pig, the anterior fibres
of the most anterior intercostal muscle cross superficially over the second rib-cartilage to
be inserted into the sternum below it, showing a feeble development of the sterno-costalis
or 8wpracostalis muscle. In the Ass the muscle is represented by one digitation only. Upon the whole it seems to me that the balance of facts is more in favour of the
identity of the human abnormal spracostalis muscle with the sferno-costalis of the
Mammalia, than with the rectus thoracicus of these animals, as in the homology proposed
by Professor Turner. Finally, I would refer to the same $4pracostal or sterno-costal

third, and fourth ribs, and inserted into the edge of the first rib near the point corresponding to the insertion
of the sealenns antieus in Man, The artery of the fore limb croxzed its insertion. Tt was in close contact with
the 8calenus, indeed ome of its fibres joined that muscle” (gp. cit. p. 297 and pl. 6).
