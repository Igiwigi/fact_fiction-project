muscular whorls. We have observed that there is exceedingly little delicate connective
tissue between the muscle fibres of the S-A ring (or the A-V ring) in the salamander
heart; no more, in fact, than that between the muscle fibres in any other part of the
heart. It is extremely difficult, if not actually impossible, to decide by an examination
of serial sections that the fibres of the S-A ring are in the form of a spiral, rather than
arranged in a regular circular fashion. Assuming that the impulse passes along the
length of the muscle fibres and not across from one muscle bundle to a neighbouring
one through the connective tissue separating them, the acute branching of the fibres
will have the effect of converting the ‘morphological ring’ into a ‘ physiological spiral’,
so that the wave of contraction will have to traverse a relatively long spiral pathway
from the sinus to the atrrum.
