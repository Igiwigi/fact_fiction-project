Disastrous shipwrecks are the consequence. During the last ten years no less than
two hundred and seventy-three yessels have been reported as totally lost on our own
coasts in fog or thick weather. The loss, I believe, has been far greater on the American
seaboard, where trade is more eager and fogs more frequent than they are here. No
wonder, then, that earnest efforts should haye been made to find a substitute for light in
80und-signals, powerful enough to give warning and guidance to mariners while still at
a safe distance from the shore.

Such signals have been established to some extent upon our own coasts, and to a still
greater extent along the coasts of Canada and the United States. But the evidence as
to their value and performance is of the most conflicting character, and no investigation
sufficiently thorough to clear up the uncertainty has hitherto been made. In fact, while
the velocity of 8ound has formed the snbject of refined and repeated experiment by
the ablest philosophers, since the publication of Dr. Dernax's celebrated paper in the
Philosophical Transactions for 1708, no systematic inquiry has, to my knowledge, been
made into the causes which affect the intensity of ound in the atmosphere.

As an attempt to fill the blank here indicated, I beg to submit to the Royal Society
some account of an investigation on fog-signals recently carried out at the instance of,
and in conjunction with, the Elder Brethren of the Trinity House. Soon after my return
from America I was requested, as the scientific adviser to the Corporation, to undertake
the direction of this inquiry. I entered upon it inspired by duty rather than hope,
for I feared that the obseryations would be tedious and the scientific results uncertain.
But the study of any natural problem, if only steadfastly pursued, is sure in the end to
