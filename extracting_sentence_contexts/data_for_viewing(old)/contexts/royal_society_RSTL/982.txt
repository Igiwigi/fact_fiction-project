of the rings when examined with homogeneous light of that
colour from which they are farthest asunder ; but with the
greatest attention, in plates of considerable thickness, I have
not been able to observe the slightest shifting of the axis, or
deviation from the circular figure, in passing from a red to a

theory, that any difference which may exist in their position,
if too small to be sensible to the eye, can produce only an
imperceptible deviation of tints. In fact, if we suppose a =0 .
for any colour, we get, for the position of the virtual pole,

when Ja is 80. Now, the polarising force of the apophyllite
being very feeble, the diameters of the rings in any plate of
moderate thickness must so far exceed this very minute quan-
tity, that the virtual poles, did any exist, must fall within the
limit of the central blackness ; the Newtonian scale would
