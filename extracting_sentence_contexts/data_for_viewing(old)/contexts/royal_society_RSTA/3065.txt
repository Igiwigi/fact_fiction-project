in high-chlorophyll years. These findings are in agreement with our observations showing that
haptophytes are omnipresent. While these groups contribute less to algal biomass, as a result of
their smaller size, they are of high importance for DMS(P) fluxes.

(b) Drivers of DMS(P) production

Sulfur compounds, POC and Chl a in the surface waters varied by a factor of 5-6 over the entire
transect. When using a linear model to explain the drivers of the DMS(P) concentration, DMS(P)t
and DMSPp were best explained by POC, then by the haptophyte pigment Hex-Fuco and thirdly
by the oxygen concentration. The DMS(P)d pool was best explained by the nitrate concentration,
then POC and another haptophyte pigment, Hex-kFuco (table 3).

The fact that POC explains DMSPp better than the total phytoplankton biomass expressed as
Chl a or the haptophyte contribution to the community is intriguing and was examined further. A
potential contributor to high POC loading of the water column is sea-ice melt. Upon ice melt, ice
algae that contain DMSP are released to the upper water column. High concentrations of DMSP
in the MIZ have been attributed to this process (e.g. [19,20]), but not studied in detail in the
Antarctic. Compared to an Arctic study on sea ice and release of algal biomass and DMSP to the
underlying water [49], our DMSP-to-Chl a ratios were very high (10 versus 64 + 26.5 mmol DMSP
(g Chl a)}), highlighting the difference in community structure. In the Arctic study, an under-
ice bloom of diatoms developed, whereas we found a substantial contribution of haptophytes to
the community. At the same time, the DMSPp-to-POC ratios in our samples were relatively low
(514 + 157 umol DMSP (g C)*? or 0.006 + 0.002 mol : mol). These values are substantially less than
the 0.011 mol: mol observed in cultures of haptophyte algae [23] and suggest additional sources
of POC.
