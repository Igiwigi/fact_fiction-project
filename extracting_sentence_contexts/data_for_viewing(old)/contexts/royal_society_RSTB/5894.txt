occurring in 41 per cent. on the right, is found in only 11 per cent. on the left
(CunninGHAM, loc. cit., and QUANJER, loc. cit.). Numerical relations for both hemispheres
are desirable also for Negroes and Australians.

In the Dutch a more frontal position and typically transverse location of the lunate
sulcus is less frequent with long heads than with short heads, as may be explained by the
skull. In the Negro, however (BRopMANN, loc. cit. swpra), and also as it seems in the
Egyptian and Australian, the lunate frequently extends rather far on the convexity
(to the lambdoid suture, SHELLSHEAR)}, and the same has been observed in Egyptian
Fellaheen by Exxior Smrrx (1904) and in the Madurese by Van Noort (loc. cit. infra).

Although a larger number of brains is necessary for reliable statistical figures, such
facts—not generally correlated with skull form, or even the reverse of what might be
expected in such skulls—are the most valuable ones for anthropological studies on
the brain.

The question becomes much more difficult if a primitive arrangement may be corre-
lated with the primitive frontally sloping skull alone as well as with a primitive encephalic
relation, as is the case with the frontal and temporal sulci.

In order to trace the latter we have to start with the brains of extinct human races.

To begin with a few words concerning the possibility of using the lines applied in this
paper for the study of prehistoric brain casts. With endocranial casts we can only
have an opinion concerning the markings on the convexity ; the study of the mesial
