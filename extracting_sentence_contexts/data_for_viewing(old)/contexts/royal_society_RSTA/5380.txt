3. The topics covered by this special issue

The present special issue, to which this piece is an introduction, is devoted to
recent works related to nonlinearities in nano and meso scales. Naturally, it
does not intended to exhaust a theme abundant in open questions, challenges
and potential applications. Nevertheless, the idea is to put together a set
of comprehensive papers addressing many different contexts where nonlinear
behaviour emerges at very small scales, either setting the features of systems
that are themselves of meso and nano sizes or being the smallest manifestation
of nonlinearities in larger scales. The publication selects problems that are
representative of the fundamental questions raised in the area, as well as of
possible technological applications. In fact, by addressing topics such as:

— decoherence and the environment influence on quantum problems,
— large-molecule dynamics,

— fluid and plasma physics,

— nonlinear wave propagation,

— statistical mechanics and thermodynamics at small scales, and

— response theory,
