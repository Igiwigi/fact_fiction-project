The theory I venture to submit is as follows ;— -

The nascent gases are generated at temperatures approximately as given by
equation (1) and by the red curves in Plates 16, 17, and 18. Under the low densities and pressures at the very high temperatures with which
we are concerned, the CO, and possibly some H,O are partially dissociated, giving
rise to the fall in temperature exhibited by the results obtained from equation (2) at
low densities. At high densities, as already pointed out, the two equations give, in
some cases, accordant results, in all cases tolerable agreement; it therefore appears
to me to be reasonable to suppose that the facts I have recorded are due to partial
dissociation at low densities and pressures, which dissociation is prevented by the
very high pressures ruling at densities of 0°40, 0°45, and 0°50. As no free oxygen is ever found in the analysis, in cooling down any free oxygen
due to dissociation must have combined and the heat lost by dissociation regained. The re-combination must, however, be very gradual, as no discontinuity is observed
in the cooling curves.
