expansion of a platinum bar plunged into melting cast iron, was 2786”.

It may be obseryed, that in both cast iron and wrought iron, the calculation
from the rate of expansion to the boiling point of water gives a temperature
higher than the true; and that, in both, the calculation from the point of boil-

ing mercury affords a result lower than the true. This might afford some
grounds for conjecturing that, although the rate of expansion evidently in-
creases beyond the temperature of boiling water, it does not continue to in-
crease to the end ; but there is another inference from the fact, which I am
rather inclined to adopt.

In calculating the temperature of melting cast iron, from the expansion of
the platinum bar, I applied a correction, upon the supposition that the same
rate of increase of expansion which was exhibited by platinum between the
boiling points of water and mercury continued to the higher degrees; whereas
there is great reason to suppose that the rate must be an increasing one; and,
although this-might not sensibly affect the final result of the comparatively
low temperature of melting silyer, the calculation of the temperature of melt-
ing iron, which is more than one third higher, would be sensiþly affected by
it. I think it therefore extremely probable that the true temperature of melt-
ing cast iron is below 2786?.
