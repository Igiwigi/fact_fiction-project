The modi-
fication of the artery as a whole is, however, much less than that of the anterior
carotid. In the Fox Shark (Alopecias vulpes), one of the Lamnide, the carotid system approaches
the extreme degree of elaboration observed in Lamna, but is without the formation,
as in that genus, of true plexuses by the branching and anastomosis of its several com-
ponents. In fact, the arrangement of the vessels is similar to that just described in
Carcharias, but far more complicated,
