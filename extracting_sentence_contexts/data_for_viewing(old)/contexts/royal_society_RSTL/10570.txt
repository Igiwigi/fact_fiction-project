tion and amount of ammonia-salts, and precisely the same complex mineral manure,
including potass, as that applied to plot 9, but with 2000 lbs. of cub wheat straw in
addition. The object was to try the effect of silica, and of carbonaceous organic matter,
supplied somewhat in the same condition as in dung. The straw would, of course,
contain a certain amount of other mineral constituents besides silica, and the amount
annually 8upplied contained also about 9 lbs. of nitrogen. Undoubtedly, however, the
manurial constituents of the straw would be for the most part very slowly available.

Compared with plot 9 without the straw, plot 13 with it gave an average of several
hundred pounds more produce per acre annually ; and, like plot 9, it has yielded rather
more during the last five years than during the firs 20, Over the 20 years, and
probably since, plot 13 has yielded more mineral matter, and more nitrogen, per acre per
annum ; in fact, more of each individual mineral constituent than plot 9, especially of
potass and phosphoric acid. Of silica, plot 13 furnished rather less in the later than
in the earlier years ; but whilst in the earlier years the two plots yielded practically
the same amount, the amount annually taken up fell off in the later years very con-
siderably on plot 9, but much less on plot 13; so that the increased yield of silica

over plot 9 was all in the later years. Over the 20 years, however, the excess of
silica, taken up where the straw was used, was only about one-eighth as much as it
