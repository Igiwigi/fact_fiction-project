It will be clear that the colourless strain may have arisen as a variation in a single
spore at any point between the second lineal generation in tube (C. 1) and the last
lineal generation in tube (EK. 6). If, for example, in the former, none of the offspring
of this spore, although present in the later cultures, produced selerotia until a
favourable opportunity occurred in tube (E. 6). As, for essential purposes, the
colourless form differs from the parental form only in the absence of sclerotial
pigmentation, the presence of the former could not possibly be ascertained in a
culture of the latter in the absence of the formation of its sclerotia. If, therefore,
the aberrant form arose as a single spore variation, it is impossible to locate exactly
its point of origin.

Certain facts relevant to the foregoing must, however, be noted. It has been an
invariable technique throughout the whole of the research, when transferring
inoculum from one tube to another, to take this either from a single conidiophore or,
preferably, from a single germinated sclerotium. Now, every conidiophore and each
sclerotium arises not only from a single original spore, but actually takes origin in a
single mycelial cell. It will be obvious that this very considerably narrows the range
wherein the aberrant form may have arisen as a spore saltation.

Furthermore, from its inception the colourless strain has been constantly repro-
duced by means of spores, aud if it arose as a spore variation, the very existence of
the new form implies thet this particular spore germinated and produced a mycelium
giving rise to conidiophores and spores, the latter possessing the new potentiality.
But a single mycelium gives rise to an immense number of conidiophores, and the
