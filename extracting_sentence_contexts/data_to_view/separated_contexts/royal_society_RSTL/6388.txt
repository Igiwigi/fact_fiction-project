Hence we are furniſhed with a method of knowing
the velocity of the wind, from obſerving the velocity
of the windmill fails; for knowing the radius, and
the number. of turns in a minute, we ſhall have the
velocity of the extremities ; which, divided by. the
following diviſors, will give the velocity of the
wind,
unloaded 4.2
loaded —3.3
Dutch fails in their beſt poſition -- ata Li

oaded —2.7
unloaded 4.0
loaded— 2.6

From the above diviſors there ariſes the following
compendiums ; ſuppoſing the radius to be 3o feet,
which is the moſt uſual length in this country, and
the mill to be loaded to a maximum, as is uſually the
caſe with corn mills ; for every 3 turns in a minute,
of the Dutch ſails in their common poſition, the wind
ill move at the rate of 2 miles an hour ; for every
5 turns in a minute, of the Dutch ſails in their beſt

pofttion, the wind moves 4, miles an hour ; and for
every 6 turns in a minute, of the enlarged ſails in
their beſt poſition, the wind will move 5 miles an
hour,

The following table, which was communicated
to me by my friend Mr. Rouſe, and which appears to
have been conſtructed with great care, from a con-
fiderable number of facts and experiments, and which
having relation to the ſubject of this article ; I here
inſert it as he ſentit to me: but at the ſame time muſt
obſerve, that the evidence for,thoſe numbers where
the velocity of the wind exceeds 50 miles an hour,
do not ſeem of equal authority with thoſe of 50 miles
an hour and under, It is alſo to be obſerved, that
the numbers in col. 3. are calculated according to the
ſquare of the velocity of the wind, which, in mode-
rate velocities, from what has been before obſerved,
will hold very nearly. y
