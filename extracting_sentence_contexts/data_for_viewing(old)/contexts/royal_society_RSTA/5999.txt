In the gas-like models, the wealth exchange between agents follows the same rule as energy
exchange between two gas molecules in kinetic theory; that is why they are called kinetic wealth
exchange models. Bachelier in his 1900 PhD thesis developed a ‘theory of speculation’ [31], where
he suggested a practical connection between stochastic theory and financial analysis. The idea
that velocity distribution for gas molecules and income distribution for agents can be compared
was first addressed in [32], although no specific reason behind this was addressed. The first
and simplest conservative model of this kind was proposed by Dragulescu and Yakovenko (DY
model) [19]. In this model, N agents randomly exchange wealth pairwise keeping the total wealth
M constant. It is shown that the steady-state (t > 00) wealth there follows a Boltzmann-Gibbs
distribution: P(m) = (1/T) exp(—m/T); T = M/N [21,22].

A modification to this model considering the fact that agents save a definite fraction of their
wealth 4 before taking part in any trading, termed as saving propensity, was addressed first by
Chakraborti & Chakrabarti [20] (CC model). This results in a wealth distribution close to Gamma
distributions [33,34] and is seen to fit well to empirical data for the low and middle wealth regime
of an economy [8]. Later, a model was proposed by Chatterjee et al. [35,36] (CCM model) where
distributed saving propensities were assumed for individuals. The importance of the model is
that it led to a wealth distribution with a Pareto-tail. Apart from wealth distribution, people
often study network-like features in these models [37-40], a few of which address preferential
interaction between agents. In [40], it was considered that two agents will interact with more
probability if their wealths are ‘close’ or if they have interacted before.

In a real economy, however, this preferential interaction often depends on some other factors.
Restriction in interaction may arise in some situations as we have seen in the recent pandemic.
