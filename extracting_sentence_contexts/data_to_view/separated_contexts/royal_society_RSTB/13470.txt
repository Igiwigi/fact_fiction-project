This involved stat-
ing the number of ECU they had sent, and the number of ECU
their Agent had returned—the actual number sent and
returned were summarized on screen for participants to refer
to if they wished. There were told that this piece of gossip
would be given to the participant who would next interact
with this Agent. It was explained that in each round participants would be
matched at random with an Agent strategy, conditional on
two restrictions: (i) they would never play a given Agent strat-
egy twice in a row (in fact, they played each of the 24 strategies
only once) and (ii) they would not receive a piece of gossip
from the same Investor in two consecutive rounds. It was
further explained that if they were paired with an Agent that
no one had previously interacted with, they would not receive

(i) Participants

Participants were 184 university students who had agreed to
be contacted about studies run through the FEELE lab at the
University of Exeter. A subset of these participants (N = 24)
provided the Agent strategies; the remainder (N = 160) took
part in the study proper.
