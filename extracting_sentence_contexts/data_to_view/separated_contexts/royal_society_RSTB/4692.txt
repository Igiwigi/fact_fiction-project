HassE figures a caudal
vertebra of a much younger fish, showing the membrana elastica externa still super-
ficial in the four regions where the intermedialia will later be developed (15, D,
Plate 34, fig. 17). A similar stage of development is seen in Gorrrer’s ripe embryo
of Seyliorhinus canicula (18, Plate 29, fig. 18). Gorrts, it is to be observed, dismisses the intermedialia of Scyliorhinus as mere
“ diinne Fortsetzungen ” of the arch-cartilages, and ‘“ Verbindungsstiicke der Wirbel-
bigen untereinander,” and he is unable to agree with KOLLER as to their peri-

chondrial origin (13, p. 491); but he holds the same view with regard to the
intermedial wedges of the Carchariidie, in spite of the fact that his own figures
(figs. 38 and 41) demonstrate the mode of origin that is claimed by K6untker. Fic, 15.—Seyliorhinus marmoratus, x8.
