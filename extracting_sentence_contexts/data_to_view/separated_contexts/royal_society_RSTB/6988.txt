I agree with Sewell. There is no trace of
a median pigmented eye, and the nerves appear to end at the ganglia. Each so-called
ganglion contains two large conspicuous cells, a fact which although he does not mention
it, it is clear from his text-figure 18 that Sewell also observed. The small median nerve runs forward on a sheet of tissue but in a tortuous manner, and
not straight forward as do the lateral nerves. In its twistings it gives off various branches,
until at the edge of the sheet there occurs a distinct, but small, ovoid structure also con-
taining two relatively large cells.
