same soil samples previously reported in Delgado-Baquerizo
et al. [44], encompassing a wide array of ecosystems from dry
grasslands to tropical forests. These soil-core OTUs represented
0.66% of the total number of OTUs (112 out of 16936 OTUs),
but on average, 27.5% (7.4%) of total OTU abundance of total
identified OTUs among all soil samples (minimum 6.5%, maxi-
mum 42.5%) (electronic supplementary material, figure S2A).
Sourcetracker2 analysis was used to trace soil-core profiles
of each global soil sample in order to understand whether
soil-core taxa were actually reflective of soil ecosystems, or
whether they were contaminants, perhaps from reagents
or airborne particles. The soil-core OTU abundances for
global soil sample types do in fact map on to soil microbial
ecosystems rather than host-associated microbiomes (approx.
99% soil identity), and recapitulate the soil ecosystem from
which the samples came (electronic supplementary material,
figure S2B). The soil-core OTUs served as the representative
OTU database against which diverse human- and animal-
host gut microbiome communities were mapped at 97%
identity (see figure 1 for workflow depiction). The resulting
abundance tables demonstrate that there is some component
of soil-core taxa that are prevalent in host-associated gut micro-
biome communities (figure 2), potentially deriving from direct
contact with soils (a proxy for the intensity of interaction with
the natural environment).
