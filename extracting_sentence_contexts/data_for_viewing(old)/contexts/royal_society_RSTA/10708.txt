These facts relating to the drawing of the last three stages are worthy of notice,
as the results of a number of experiments on these wires show some irregularity in the
progressive change of their physical properties in the final stages, and the method
of drawing in these stages may in part account for the irregularity.

5. The samples illustrating the twelve stages were not long enough to allow the
thickest of them to be made more than 50 diameters long, and this fixed the
dimension ratio for the whole series, but an additional series, from No. 5 upwards,
was cut to a dimension ratio of 100. All the wires were magnetised in the same
way between the poles of a powerful electromagnet, and then immediately examined
for magnetic intensity, and its changes under variations of temperature, with the
apparatus formerly described.* The results, which are given in Table III., and
plotted in Diagram III., disclose several interesting facts; thus rolling hot and
