Hence the viscosity of water at 30° C. is one-half that at 3° C., and that at 25° C.
is one-half that at 0° C. So that at the two lower temperatures, twice the force is
required to overcome the resistance to flow due to the viscosity of water that is
required at the higher ones. Since an appreciable amount of the total resistance is
due to this cause, temperature will form a factor of some importance in the regulation
of the flow of sap. This: action of temperature might, in fact, in some degree be
responsible for the xerophytic character of winter evergreens, and for the gradual
disappearance or dwarfing of trees towards the extreme north and south,

Physical deductions cannot, however, be applied to living organisms if unsupported
by direct experiment. As a matter of fact experiment showed that using 50-centim.

lengths cut from transpiring branches, the amount of flow
ce eadof water though influenced by the temperature, altered to a less extent
than would be expected from the changes of viscosity. This
is probably owing to the presence of air in the vessels, which,
ay apart from, the expansion and contraction caused by the changes
| of temperature, and from the more rapid solution at the lower
temperature, would exercise a resistance to flow slightly increased
by a fall of temperature owing to the increased surface-tension
of the air-bubbles in the vessels. In fact, after passing water
through for some time under pressure it was found that the
amount of flow became much more nearly proportional to the
