Acheul. This I conceive is sufficient to prove that the high-level valley grayels cannot be
ascribed to floods of the present rivers, as has been, even of late, suggested. The only
means adequate to fill, under existing conditions, the river-valleys of the Waveney, the
Ouse, the Somme, and still more of the Seine, would be the ingress of the sea; but such a
supposition is at once refuted by the fact of the prevalence of land and freshwater
Shells in both the high- and low-level gravels, and the absence of marine remains unless
immediately adjacent to the present coast. If therefore neither the supposition of river-
floods, nor of a different relative level of land and sea allowing the latter to penetrate
up the valleys, be admissible, how far are the facts in accordance with the hypothesis
of these depoxits being the alluvia of old rivers, and the yalleys their excayated channels? Let us in the first instance trace the direction whence the materials have come.
