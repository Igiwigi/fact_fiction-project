Sometimes at the side of the furrow there is a very distinct oval or fusi-

Form group of small cells, as shown on the right in the figure. A (46) Beneath the lateral and middle portions of this superficial layer of grey substance,

almost exactly the same time. My Essay on the Medulla Oblongata, in which the statement appears, was read

* before the Royal Society in June 1857, and published in Part I. of the Philosophical Transactions for 1858;
and ScuniveR VANS DER Kork's Exsay on the Medulla Oblongata, in which the same fact is stated, was also
published in 1858 (see his translator's Preface). But there is some difference between SCHRODER YAN DER Kork's
account and my own. He considers that the whole of the grey tubercle in the upper part of the medulla
consists of the descending root of the trigeminus, and that it differs in structnre from the grey tubercle below
the olivary bodies; while T regard the grey tubercle throughout the medulla as the downward prolongation of
the grey nudleus of the trigeminus, and the longitudinal bundles in front of the tubercle, as the downward
prolongation of the fibres of the posterior root.
