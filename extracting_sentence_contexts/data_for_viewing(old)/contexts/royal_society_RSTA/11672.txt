The criticisms of BeHRENS, however, on the alloy SnCu, suggest another explana-
tion of the phenomena which is .not without probability. It may be that with
more tin than SnCu,, the liquid alloy breaks up into two conjugate liquids, and
that this state exists until more than 25 atoms of tin are present. If this were so,
we should have expected, as in the copper-lead curve, that this part would have been
horizontal ; but, assuming the two conjugates to differ little in density, the slight,
but real, slope in this part of the curve might be accounted for by imperfect realiza-
tion of equilibrium at the freezing point.

The interesting complete cooling curves of copper-tin alloys given by Professor
Roserts-Austen, in his Report on Alloys, will, we think, be found to be consistent
with the facts observed by us, although we should not perhaps altogether agree with
him in the inferences that can be drawn from these facts.

The Silver-Antimony Curve. (Fig. 11.)

In this curve it will be seen that up to 25 atomic per cents. of antimony the
steepness increases with increase in the amount of antimony. As in the case of the
similar feature of the tin-copper curve, we can explain this by assuming that the
antimony combines with the silver to form a compound molecule.

At 25 atomic per cents. of antimony there is a well-marked angle, and although
there is only one point determined between 15 and 25 atomic per cents., yet the
direction of the lines leaves little doubt as to the position of this angle. â€˜The angle,
