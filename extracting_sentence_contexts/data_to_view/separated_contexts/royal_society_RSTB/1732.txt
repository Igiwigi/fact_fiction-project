The sporophylls, with
their broad lamin, sharply marked off from the almost cylindrical petiole, are
characteristic of both forms jointly. The insertion of the sporangium, by a narrow
attachment, to the upper surface of the sporophyll, where it begins to expand into
the lamina, is as I have shown, essentially the same in both. The spores also have
something in common, at least in the fact that they are winged, while the form and
structure of the sporangium are alike in both. These various points of agreement and difference find, I believe, their best expres-
sion, if we regard the two forms as two species of the same genus. We now come to the more important question of the relation of these forms to
other plants, and especially to other members of the Paleozoic Flora.
