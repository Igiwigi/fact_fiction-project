We may proceed further to examine the seasonal changes in the relative
amplitudes of the various components. The numbers in Table Q relate to the
equinoctial variations, and are obtained by taking é to be zero in Table O. During
the solstitial quarters, however, 3 is approximately 20 degrees. If this value is
substituted, the following numbers, corresponding to those in Table Q, are

obtained :—
Qs. Qs’. Qu. Qs,
(75) 24°0 65 O61 0018

* The numbers given are 60 {(m-+ 1)/(2m+ 1)} pu” (R/r)”, the factor 60 being inserted for convenience.
The factor (R/r)” allows for the fact that the magnetic variations are produced at some considerable height
above the surface regions where observations are made; R/r is taken as 0°98 (cf. $§ 21, 22).

Formule resembling those of Table O were given in my first memoir, but only carried as far as a, and
a; in this paper some small corrections are made, and a further approximation is made by including the
terms 4,8, a,d2, a4, @,2d2, and as. With the above values of a and @ the results seem to show satisfactory
numerical convergence,


DIURNAL VARIATIONS OF TERRESTRIAL MAGNETISM 59

From Table J it appears that the amplitudes of the three components Q,’, Q,°, Q,!
are smaller at the solstices than at the equinoxes, while Q,' is approximately constant.
