clotting of the blood whenever a single lethal dose is given either subcutaneously or
intravascularly, the symptoms being of an acute and rapidly fatal character. The Puff
Adder venom also in a single lethal dose either subcutaneously in pigeons, or intra-
venously in larger animals, produces intravascular clotting, but in proportion to its
minimal lethal dose in pigeons it requires a larger dose of it to cause clotting than of
Daboia venom, Next, passing on to the Pit Vipers we find that in the case of
Trimeresurus anamadlensis fatal failure of the circulation can be produced by a single
small intravenous dose without any intravascular clotting other than locally in the
vein through which the venom enters the circulation. Yet a larger dose may produce
marked and rapidly fatal intravascular clotting as in Experiment III. with this
venom. Lastly, in the case of the Rattlesnake venom I have never found any intra-
vascular clotting, except once at the seat of injection, after death brought about by a
single intravenous injection of the venom. ‘These facts alone are sufficient. to show
that intravascular clotting is not an essential lethal action of the Viperine snakes
as a class.

But we may go further, for the experiments recorded in this paper show that in
