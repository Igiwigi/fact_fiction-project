If P were very small, this would generally be considered as an indication
that the hypothesis, H, was probably false, and vice versa. BERTRAND expressed the’
pessimistic view that no test of this kind could give reliable results. Borst, however, in a later discussion, considered that the method described could be
applied with success provided that the character, x, of the observed facts were properly
chosen—were, in fact, a character which he terms “‘ en quelque sorte remarquable.” We appear to find disagreement here, but are inclined to think that, as is so
often the case, the difference arises because the two writers are not really considering
precisely the same problem. In general terms the problem is this: Is it possible that
there are any efficient tests of hypotheses based upon the theory of probability, and if
so, what is their nature?
