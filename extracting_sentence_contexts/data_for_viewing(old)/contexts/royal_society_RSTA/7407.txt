All forms of sampling increase rapidly in accuracy as the sampling interval is decreased,
the precision per point being more than doubled, for example, for stratified random samples
when the block size is decreased from 8 to 4 units.


368 F. YATES ON SYSTEMATIC SAMPLING

Over the lower part of the range systematic sampling is about four times as accurate as
stratified random sampling with one point per block. For higher values of d, however, the
relative accuracy falls away, and there is a peak at d = 16 where systematic sampling, as
judged by S,, is no more accurate than stratified random sampling. This, and the even poorer
performance of the actual systematic samples, is a reflexion of the fact that certain of the
major features of the variation in altitude happen to coincide with the sampling interval,
but this is scarcely likely to be more than a chance effect. It may be noted that even the least
accurate of the values of h{, has a discrepancy of less than twice the standard deviation of
the corresponding stratified random sample of one per block, and of only 1:5 times the
standard deviation of the stratified random sample with two per block. Undoubtedly,
however, as examination of the altitude curve (not reproduced) indicates the advantage of
systematic over random sampling is fading away as d is increased, as also is the value of
stratification. A degree of instability is also entering into the estimates of the systematic
sampling variance due to the shortness of the sequence relative to the sampling interval.

The figure shows that D,, is a very poor estimate of the systematic sampling error in material
of this kind. In general, E, provides a much better estimate, though it behaves poorly at
