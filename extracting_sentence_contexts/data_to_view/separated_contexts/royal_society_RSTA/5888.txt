The source-type solution as 7 — 00; U(é) = e/(I - Si e- dn).

(b) Kink-type solution

As noted already, the theory developed in [1] for the 3D Navier-Stokes equations works for initial
velocity € BY oo (R), but ¢ L5(R9). We will consider an analogous 1D problem as an illustration. In fact, equation (2.5) can be solved using confluent hypergeometric functions, viz. Kummer’s
functions. Consider
w+ AEW' + BW =0, (2.6)

where A and B are constants (to be set A =a/v and B = C/v).
