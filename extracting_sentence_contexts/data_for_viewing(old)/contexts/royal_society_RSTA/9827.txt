400 DR. W. M. HICKS: A CRITICAL STUDY OF SPECTRAL SERIES.

It was shown in [I.] that the F series of the alkalies could be represented by a series
of the form m+1—a(1—1/m). The same is the case with the Al and Zn groups.
As @ is so small and varies so little it can scarcely be a function of the atomic weight.
The atomic volumes of the elements are much more even and it may be a function of
them as is the case with the p-sequence. In fact, in the case of the alkalies, the a
are not far from being proportional to v, 2v, 2v, 3v, for the four elements considered,
but the data are so inexact and uncertain that it seems not worth while to undertake
an exhaustive numerical discussion.

We do not know that the chief lines of these sets are those depending on m = 3.
Tf lines exist depending on m = 2 they would all be in extremest red, in fact with
wave-lengths comparable with those of electro-magnetic waves capable of being
experimentally excited, and it is possible that VF (2) might be the same for all low
melting-point elements and as for He (see [I.]). For m= 1 we should expect the
lines of negative wave number in regions which have been observed and in which no
such lines have been seen.

The F series in the high melting-point elements, on the contrary, are profoundly
influenced by the atomic weight term. Either the lines observed belong to a different
type from those of the others, or they are based on a normal type of aggregation
which is modified by collateral and other types of displacement due to the splitting
up of the typical aggregations, or to a more complex system of new aggregations.
