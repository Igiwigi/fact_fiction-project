We can now justify the entries in the first row of table 1 in the text. Fix a perfect-recall tree
and an information set in the tree. Given that the DM remembers all of his choices at previous
information sets, and everything he knew at those information sets, the only effect of a signal
(classical or quantum) at the information set can be to change the DM’s probabilities about the
state of the world. But, we have assumed (see §5 in the text and appendix B) independence
between signals and Nature, so no such change is possible.

Appendix B. Correlation between signals and Nature

Consider the imperfect-recall decision tree depicted in figure 12, and the joint distribution of a
coin toss at the team’s information set, and Nature’s move, depicted in figure 13. The team gets
an expected pay-off of 1 (in fact, 1 almost surely) by choosing Left after Heads and Right after Tails.
Its expected pay-off in the underlying tree is 3 (regardless of its strategy).

This shows that proposition 5.2 is false in the absence of the independence assumption
between signals and Nature.

Appendix C. Non-existence of a joint probability space

It is instructive to see directly (rather than via appeal to proposition 5.2) why the signal structure
of figure 8 cannot be derived from a joint probability space (2, 1). We can take 2 to be as depicted
in table 2,5 so that isa probability measure on the set {w®,...,@!°}. Now let us try to derive the

5There is no loss of generality in taking @ to be of this canonical form. This follows from starting with a general (even infinite)
