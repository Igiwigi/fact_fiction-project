layer-liquid phase’ phase transition boundaries, respectively. As this takes place, the mushy layer
is filled with the solid and liquid material. In addition, solid phase structures in the form of
dendrites, nuclei and more complex formations evolve in such a layer and completely compensate
its supercooling. In this case, the mushy layer is described by means of the quasi-equilibrium
model [8-10]. We consider the case when the temperature distributions in the solid phase (Ts)
and mushy layer (Tm) can be approximated by the linear functions

Ts(z, t) =To(t) + Ci(f)z, 0<z<a(t), 11
and T(z, t)=Ty(£) + To(t)z, a(t) <z < b(t), en)

where To(t) is the temperature at z=0 (e.g. atmospheric temperature), and C,(t), Ti(t) and
T2(t) represent the time-dependent functions found below. The linear form of the temperature
profiles (2.1) follows from the fact that the temperature relaxation time is many times smaller
than a characteristic time of the phase interface motion or than a characteristic relaxation time of
solute diffusion. Note that a linear temperature distribution has been observed in a number of
experiments (see, among others, [26-29]).

Let us describe the mass transport in the mushy layer by means of the Scheil equation [30,31]:

ppt — P)Cm) =O, alt) <2 < b(t), (2.2)
where ¢(z, t) is the solid fraction and Cy(z, t) stands for the solute concentration (brine salinity in

the case of sea water and ice). Note that equation (2.2) satisfies experimental data in a broad range
of experimental conditions [1].
