Neptune-sized worlds. Yet, we still have little-to-no information about what that ground-truth in
bulk density infers for the chemistry, dynamics and structure of the Ice Giants to draw from.

2. Ground truth from Jupiter and Saturn

We always look to the ‘known’ for some ground truth. In planetary science that ‘known’ are
the planets that make up our solar system. The discoveries made by exoplanets are constantly
challenging that ground truth: demographics, formation, composition, etc. Yet, things can only


challenge a view on ground truth when there is one to challenge. In the case of the Ice Giants—
Uranus and Neptune—we do not in fact know the ‘knowns’.

The exploration of our solar system has been going on for millennia since the first person
looked up and wondered why and how the sun, moon and stars moved. However, it was not
until the invention of the telescope, rockets, and an ability to remotely power objects, that allowed
us to truly examine our nearest neighbours. None of which could be done without international
collaboration, funding, and a vast number of people with a drive for knowledge.

The Voyager 2 fly-bys in the late 1980s were the last and only time we have examined our Ice
Giants up close, and our understanding and extent of our solar system is still being realized by
the Voyager probes as they leave the influence of our Sun and call another star their home. But
these fly-bys only opened questions and answered very little about the most distant planets in
our solar system. However, there have been other missions to the other giant planets in our solar
