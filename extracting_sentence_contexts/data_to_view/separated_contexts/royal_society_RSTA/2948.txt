We write the resulting
state as:

1 . .
_ iQX _ —iQX
IX) = 5 (Ite — | ne)

= |0,0) cos(QX) + if1,0) sin(QX), (3.1)

where we used the Euler formula to get the second line, and |1, 0) =(1/./2)(|t)) + |) t)) is the
mgs =0 component of the spin-triplet state. Equation (3.1) shows that the |1, 0) component appears
automatically in any S/F system due to the different phase shifts acquired by the up- and down-
spin electrons as they propagate in F. Note that the m; =0 component of the spin-triplet state has
all the same properties as the spin-singlet state, in that it oscillates and decays over a very short
length scale in F. (The fact that the ms =0 triplet component is generated in any S/F proximity
system was missed in some early theory papers. It has become commonplace to refer to short-
ranged proximity effects as simply ‘spin-singlet’ when in fact one should say ‘spin-singlet plus
ms =0 component of spin-triplet’, but the latter is too burdensome to write every time.) To get the
long-range spin-triplet components, |1, 1) =|t‘¢) or |1, —1) =|), we simply need to add a second
ferromagnetic layer whose magnetization axis is non-collinear with that of the first ferromagnetic
layer. So imagine now the system S/F’/N/F, where F’ is magnetized along the z-axis, and F is
magnetized along an axis in the x-z plane at an angle 6 with respect to the z-axis.
