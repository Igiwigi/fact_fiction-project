In other words, abduction ‘the major term is proved to belong to the middle by means
is an inference based on an iconic relation. The premise is of a term which resembles the third’ (this definition seems to
connected to the conclusion through the recall of some back- suggest that paradigmatic reasoning is an inference based
ground knowledge, the ‘rule’ in Peircean terms. This latter on an analogy), at the same time, in the Rhetorics (1356b
can be thought of as a diagrammatic model, or icon, on the 14-15 [76]) he defined the paradeigma as the transposition of
basis of which we can connect the facts stated in the premise inductive reasoning in rhetorical contexts. Thus, paradig-
with those stated in the conclusion. The abductive inference matic reasoning shares some of the features that
has a hypothetical nature: by reasoning on the ‘rule’/icon, characterize the iconic logic of abduction and, at the same
we can discover new elements about the facts we are observ- time, it also presents characters that typically identify induc-
ing and hypothesize new solutions.
