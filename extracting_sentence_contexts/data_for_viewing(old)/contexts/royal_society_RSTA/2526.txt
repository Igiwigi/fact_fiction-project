Since ao b with a|b represents a point-reflection, we may think of an unordered pair (a,b) : =
with a |b as a point, an element a with G(a) as a line, two lines a and b for which a | b as a pair of 1S
perpendicular lines, and say that a point (p,q) is incident with the line a if pq | a. With these figures
of speech in mind, the above axioms make the following statements: M1 and M2 are some of the
group axioms for the operation o (the existence of the inverse follows from M10, M3, M1 and M2,
and thus was omitted); M3 states that line-reflections are involutions; M4 states the invariance of
the set of line-reflections, M5 states that any two points can be joined by a line, which is unique
according to M6; M7 and MB state that the composition of three reflections in lines that have a
common point or a common perpendicular is a line-reflection; M9 states that there are three lines

gh, and j, such that g and h are perpendicular, j is perpendicular to neither g nor h, nor does bes
j go through the intersection point of g and h; M10 states that every motion is the composition : =
of two or three line-reflections. It is this fact, that every element of the group generated by line- : a
reflections can be written as the product of at most three line-reflections, that made the first-order 73
axiomatization of the group of motions of a metric plane possible. iL

The theorem regarding the concurrence of the medians is expressed in this language somewhat aaa
differently. Instead of stating that the three medians are incident with a point, one simply states : S
that the product of the reflections in the three medians, whose existence is explicitly stated (given : S
that midpoints need not exist in metric planes), is involutory (and thus a reflection ina line). Three 1B
lines for which the product of the reflections in them is involutory are said to lie in a pencil. This [8

means that in the projective plane in which the metric plane can be embedded, those three lines
do intersect in a point.
