Now reflect Sig, through B to A. This gives Ajgg- Inspection of (1) shows that
the only points of 4,4, which are in line with points of D and of § are those where

D to S produces the space $5573, obtained in fact by retaining those parameters whose
suffixes are 0 or 1 only. Thus

When such alternate reflexion in B and D is continued as before, we obtain the following
result:
Dye = Si6g> Aros S12678 > A 12678 > 5123678 > A 123678

Thereafter the sequence is stable. These terms are derived as in § 12 by adjoining a new
non-zero set 0,, 0’, ... at each double-arrow stage (i = 1, 2,...) until the parameters are
exhausted. The process therefore determines the nest of spaces Aj¢, Ayo57g1 A1o36799 ©
