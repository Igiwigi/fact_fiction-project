It was found that the expansion of the bag connected with the pleura did not always
coincide with increased arterial pressure. These inconsistencies did not, however,
appear to be of such a nature as to render it necessary to abandon the theory which
had been adopted. Although Lupwis had evidently some misgivings as to its truth,
he did not continue the investigation ; for in a prefatory note to a paper by E1xNBRODT,
published in 1859, Lubw16 states that during the preceding twelve years he had aban-
doned the inquiry although convinced that he had misunderstood the connexion of the
facts *.

[Note.—In the last edition of his © Lehrbuch der Physiologie,” Lupw1s gives the fol-
lowing account of the changes of arterial pressure consequent on the respiratory move-
ments :—* At the beginning of expiration the contractions of the heart become more
frequent, the mean tension of the blood increases, s0 that even during the relaxation of
the heart it inks very inconsiderably or not at all. Every new contraction induces a
higher tension than its predecessor. At the close of the expiratory moyement, when
the narrowed thorax resnmes its normal size, a long pause in the heart's action suddenly
occurs, during which the tension sinks considerably, and the moyements of the heart are
in consequence retarded,” This passage shows that until 1861 the author entertained
the same views as in 1859.]

In 1860 Lupw1e's experiments were repeated by E1xBRoDT, who published his results
