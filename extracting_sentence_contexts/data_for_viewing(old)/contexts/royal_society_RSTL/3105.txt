cles up to or towards a certain state (1370.) ; and by those which first attain it, is the
discharge first and most efficiently performed.

1409. The moment of discharge is probably determined by that molecule of the di-
electric which, from the circumstances, has its tension most quickly raised up to the
maximum intensity. In all cases where the discharge passes from conductor to con-
ductor this molecule must be on the surface of one of them ; but when it passes be-
tween a conductor and a non-conductor, it is, perhaps, not always 80 (1453.). When
this particle has acquired its maximum tension, then the whole barrier of resistance
is broken down in the line or lines of inductive action originating at it, and disruptiye
discharge occurs (1370.) : and such an inference, drawn as it is from the theory,
seems to me in accordance with Mr. Harris's facts and conclusions respecting the
resistance of the atmosphere, namely, that it is not really greater at any one dis-
charging distance than another}.

1410: It seems probable, that the tension of a particle of the same dielectric, as
air, which is requisite to produce discharge, is a constant quantity, whatever the shape
of the part of the conductor with which it is in contact, whether ball or point ; what-
ever the thickness or depth of dielectric throughout which induction is exerted ;
perhaps, even, whatever the state, as to rarefaction or condensation of the dielec-
tric; and whatever the nature of the conductor, good or bad, with which the particle
is for the moment associated. In saying 80 much, I do not mean to exclude small
differences which may be caused by the reaction of neighbouring particles on the de-
ciding particle, and indeed, it is evident that the intensity required in a particle
