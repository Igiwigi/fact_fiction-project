When a
series of measurements gives rise to a normal curve, we may probably assume
something approaching a stable condition; there is production and destruction
impartially round the mean. In the case of certain biological, sociological, and
economic â€œmeasurements there is, however, a well-marked deviation from this
normal shape, and it becomes important to determine the direction and amount of
such deviation. The asymmetry may arise from the fact that the units grouped
together in the measured material are not really homogeneous. It may happen that
we have a mixture of 2, 3,... homogeneous groups, each of which deviates about
its own mean symmetrically and in a manner represented with sufficient accuracy by
the normal curve. Thus an abnormal frequency-curve may be really built up of normal
curves having parallel but not necessarily coincident axes and different parameters.
