Therefore, in this problem, one has to compare proofs and consequently it is important to know
when two proofs can be said to be the same. For instance, one may formalize a proof in two
different ways and if we are given two different formalizations, it is important to know whether
these formalizations correspond to the same proof. In fact, if they do correspond to the same proof
and we want some kind of criteria measuring the simplicity of proofs, that criteria must assign
the same simplicity for those two formalizations. In this paper, we hope to give a possible reason for Hilbert mentioning syzygies in his 24th
problem. In order to do such, we consider the problem of identification of proofs in the context of
the membership problem of a polynomial f in an ideal.
