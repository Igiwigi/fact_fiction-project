tapetum and megaspore-membrane are peculiar, and in this respect, as in many
others, the Araucarieze are clearly marked off from the rest of the Coniferales.* In
one transverse section of a megaspore we noticed two large nuclei of approximately
equal size in the cytoplasm of a single egg-cell (fig. 28, £); we think it probable that
these may be the male and female nuclei; the nucleus shown in fig. 28, F, presents
an appearance suggestive of a male partially absorbed by a female nucleus. The
slight difference in size between the two partially-fused nuclei may be considered an
argument against their description as male and female.{ It is true that the difference
in size is usually more marked, but in Zaaodium, Coker} points out that the male
nucleus increases in size on its course to the female nucleus, and after contact the
former is half as large as the latter. In Cephalotaxus§ the difference in size is not
much more than that shown in fig. 28, r. In Sequoia sempervirens|| the male and
female nuclei appear to be approximately equal in size, a fact in favour of our interpreta-
_ tion of the constricted nucleus in Araucaria imbricata, shown in the figure.

Some of the ovules examined were found to contain several embryos in different
stages of growth; the median portion of the prothallus is often partially destroyed
and the cells in this region are distinguished by their slightly darker contents and
by a tendency to arrange themselves with their long axes parallel to the long axis
of the megaspore. The pro-embryo consists at the distal end of a somewhat
fan-shaped group of cells (fig. 28, G, c), with distinct nuclei arranged above and
around a group of small cells, e, which represent the embryo proper. Behind the
embryo occurs a bundle of long suspensor cells, s, which terminate in a group of -
rather shorter elements lying in the cavity formerly occupied by the egg-cell.
