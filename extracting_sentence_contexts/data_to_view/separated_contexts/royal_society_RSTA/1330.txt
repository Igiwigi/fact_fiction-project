From this it will be seen that in these months the ratio of the surface velocity to gradient
velocity is 1:2 and not 2:3. This may be partly due to the fact that the average
direction of normal monsoon isobars has been taken to be along great circles, which is
only approximately true, and partly to the fact that, in these months, the sea becomes
rough and consequently the frictional force is greater than that of a surface over which
the ratio 2:3 is applicable. For individual days also, then, we shall assume the ratio
to be 1:2and not 2:3. Inthe following table (No. IIT) the calculated and the observed
periods of microseisms have been given for some dates selected at random.
