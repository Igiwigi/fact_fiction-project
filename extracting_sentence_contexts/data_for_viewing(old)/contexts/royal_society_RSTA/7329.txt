The more representative results (/) indicate that for n< 13, /, may be expected to be
roughly of the order of unity.

It follows that for a moderate spread of the ,, the parameter @ (60) of the present theory

similar parameters in J,(0), the two theories will show roughly the same decline of rate
with absolute pressure. This is a mere suggestion of comparable orders of magnitude; the
pressures for a given value of the rate will in fact differ by the factor /,,.

The comparison with Kassel’s theory may be concluded at this point; the comparison
of the parameters has to a limited extent strengthened the formal similarity noted in (72).
