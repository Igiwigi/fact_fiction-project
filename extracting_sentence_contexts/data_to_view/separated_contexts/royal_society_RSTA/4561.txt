In order to provide forecasts, a deep knowledge of tsunami run-up and inundation is required. To acquire this knowledge, it is necessary to investigate the geological evidence and impacts of
past tsunamis, as well as generation sources. It is often difficult or even impossible to collect
data for a tsunami event owing to the fact that tsunamis are rare events. The small number of
available observations is the reason for the high uncertainty in the description of the source at the
generation phase, even after many years of scientific investigations in this area. Therefore, computer models, also referred to as simulators, are used to study past and future :
events.
