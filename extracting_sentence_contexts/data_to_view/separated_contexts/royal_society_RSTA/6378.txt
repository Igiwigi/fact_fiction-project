Now, the notion of mathematical equality (and, a fortiori, the notion of identity) has undergone
a far-reaching process of reconceptualization that started with the development of category theory,
continued with the enhancement of the latter to higher category theory, and has recently entered
into a new phase with the development of homotopy type theory in the early new millennium [26,27]
(see also [28] and references therein). Category theory made clear that the notion of strict equality
is indeed too strict. This fact motivated the ‘stretching’ of the notion of strict equality into the
notion of isomorphism. It soon became clear that a full-fledged development of this weakening of
the notion of strict equality requires us to extend category theory to higher category theory. In
turn, we could say that homotopy type theory focuses on the sector of higher category theory
that encodes this extension of the notion of equality, namely the higher categories known as oo-
groupoids.
