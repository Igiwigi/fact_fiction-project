is only possible for a particular relation between the pressure and density of the gas, which is different
from the one actually holding. In the case of the explosion-waves it seems possible, however, that the
temperature, pressure, and density of the gas should so adjust themselves as to make RieMany’s equations
applicable. In fact, they must do so if the front of the wave keeps its type, which it probably does
when the velocity has become constant. Tf p) and p are the densities of the gas in the undisturbed state, and at some point in the wave
respectively, then, referring the motion to a system of coordinates moving forward with the velocity V
of the wave, we have the condition of steady motion
