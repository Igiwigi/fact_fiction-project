EYRE ON STUDIES IN REPTILIAN COLOUR RESPONSE. 53

A, equestris. Excised skin of this animal placed in physiological salt solution continued
to respond for three hours to weak and strong light by pallor and darkening respectively. A curious fact upon which Haptery failed to comment was that whereas the response
times of whole animals were as quoted above, the times for excised skin were: green
to brown 30-40 secs., brown to green 12-15 secs. Not only are these times much shorter,
but their relation to each other is reversed. In whole animals melanophore expansion
takes place much more rapidly than contraction, in excised skin contraction is the
more rapid.
