They showed only slow growth, and numbers of them were
constantly becoming atretic. There were only slight differences between the mitotic
activities of the various zones, but even allowing for the large standard deviations, a
general tendency was apparent for the greatest number of cell divisions to be situated near
the primary oocyte and the smallest number in the theca folliculi. When it is further remem-
bered that the oocyte zone presented the smallest area, the conclusion that a gradient did
in fact exist appears justified. MITOTIC ACTIVITY IN THE ADULT FEMALE MOUSE = 463

When the growing follicles reached an approximate diameter of 100” growth was
suddenly greatly accelerated, an occurrence which coincided exactly with the first appear-
ance of pools of follicular fluid among the cells of the membrana granulosa.
