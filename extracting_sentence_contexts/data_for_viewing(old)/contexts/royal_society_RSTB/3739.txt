of modified ependymal epithelium, right and left, united in the middle line. The
abruptness with which this epithelium is marked off from the ordinary ependymal
epithelium of the ter is very remarkable, and is very clearly shown in the photograph
reproduced in text-fig. 20. It will be noticed that there is a conspicuous fold in the
ordinary ependymal epithelium just where it joins the sub-commissural organ on
either side, obviously due to the great development of the latter in a dorsi-ventral
direction ; this is probably a very constant character, for a very similar fold occurs
in Geotria (DENDy, 1907, «) and in the mouse (DeNpy and Nicwonrs, 1910). In
fact the sub-commissural organ appears to have a remarkably uniform structure
throughout the Vertebrate series, until it becomes more or less obsolete in the higher
primates.

The sub-commissural organ exhibits the usual histological structure. It is composed
of very greatly elongated columnar cells, almost deserving the name of fibres, placed
side by side at right angles to the surface and with crowded nuclei lying at various
