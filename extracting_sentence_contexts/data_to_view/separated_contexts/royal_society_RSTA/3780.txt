We work within the semiclassical domain,
where the electromagnetic field is treated classically and everything else is treated quantum
mechanically [37].

2. The angular momentum of light

It is now well established that light carries spin and also orbital angular momentum [38-41]. Less widely appreciated at present, however, is the fact that these are but two of many angular : 2
momenta carried by light, in the sense that there are many rotational symmetries inherent : >
to Maxwell’s equations. In this section, we give a brief overview of the basic description in : §
fundamental electromagnetic theory of the angular momentum of light, in particular, those Los
facets of it that may not be familiar to the reader but nevertheless take centre stage in the context : ~
of the chiral light-matter interactions discussed in the following section. We work here in a system [oS
of units with «9 = 49 =C=1. : Sg

There has been much controversy in the past over what constitutes a ‘true’ angular : iS
momentum.
