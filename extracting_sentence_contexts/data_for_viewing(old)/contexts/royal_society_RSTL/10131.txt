foremost azygous metapterygoid (mt.pg'.) comes into view, and the mandibles (1k.) are
cut away, distally.

Section 13,—This (Plate 17, fig. 5) is through the middle of the mid-brain (C*.),
and the back of the pituitary body (py.). The post-clinoid wall, which is an oblique
shelf running forwards and a little upwards (Plate 16, fig. 2, p.ct.), is here cut through
obliquely 80 as to appear thicker than ib is actually. This section seems to show

| the pituitary body as lying in a separate and very solid box, for the rest of the skull
| is quite distinet from it, above. This arises from the fact that the foramina ovalia are
here, with the trigeminal nerves (V.); the alisphenoidal wall, the roof, and the
thickened sphenotics are seen in the upper part of the section. The parasphenoid
© (pas.) curls round the flatter base, the parietal (pg. by mistake for p*.) and post-
| orbtial sentes were cub through. Below, the adductor mandibulz muscles (ad.m.), the
pterygoid cartilages and bones (pg.q., Pg. 9., read pg.) are s8evered, and the latter are
in one piece, for this is behind their great notch. The smaller azygous metapterygoid
—— (mt-pg.) is 8een; the extreme angle of the quadrate (q.c.) ; and the hinge and part
S of the shaft of the mandible (mk.) through the dentary and the pre-opercular bones.
A Section 14,—Here (Plate 16, fig. 6) the breach in the lower part of the walls is
5 repaired, for this is behind the foramina ovalia, and through the fore part of the auditory
= capsules (av.); the ampulla and front part of the arch of the anterior canal (.s.c.) are
& laid open. The roof is thicker and flatter ; the sphenotic wings ($.0.) are still large
