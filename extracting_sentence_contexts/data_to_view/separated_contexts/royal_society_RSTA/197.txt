Virtually all attempts at cross-species
cloning fail to develop to the adult (Chung et al. 2009). A possible explanation
is that the egg cell information is too specific (Chen et al. 2006). In fact, in the
only case so far, that of a carp nucleus and goldfish egg, the egg cytoplasm clearly
influences the phenotype (Sun et al. 2005). Strathmann (1993) also refers to the
influence of the egg cytoplasm on gene expression during early development as
one of the impediments to hybridization in an evolutionary context. There is
no good reason why cells themselves should have ceased to evolve once genomes
arose.
