fitness and immunosenesence is an important mechanism of
ageing (e.g. [19]). Accordingly, short telomeres in leucocytes
or defects in telomerase activity are associated with immune
dysfunction (reviewed in [20]). Although a recent study failed
to confirm the reliability of white cell telomere length as an indi-
cator of the age-related decline of immune activity [19], other
studies have shown that the immune system benefits from up-
regulated telomerase activity. For instance, in vivo maturation of
naive T cells into memory T cells is accompanied by telomere
loss, but in the same cells short telomeres trigger senescence
in vitro [21]. This suggests that a fine-tuned control of telomere
loss is important to preserve an optimal functioning of lym-
phoid-based immunity, and the fact that telomerase activation
rescues T-cell telomere length, prolongs their proliferation
capacity and reduces the number of circulating senescent T
cells is of central interest [22,23]. Therefore, the degree of telo-
merase activity in T cells may be one key regulating factor
maintaining their responsiveness via high replicative potential,
besides the reduction of auto-immune damage and tumour
development [20]. The observation that T-cell telomere length
is highly variable in humans is even more interesting in an evol-
utionary context [24]. Whether such natural variation exists in
other species and may be based, at least partly, on the level of
telomerase activity is a promising hypothesis to explore in
wild animals (see below).
