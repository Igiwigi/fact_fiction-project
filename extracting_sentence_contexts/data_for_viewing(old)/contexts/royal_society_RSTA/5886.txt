(i) mwc(t) > mjc = sgn(m)\c)mc for t > +00, thus myc reaches asymptotically the values
+tmc depending on whether it is initially positive or negative. If instead m{y- =0 then
mwc remains zero at all times;

(ii) the convergence of myc(t) to myc = sgn(m\c)mc is exponentially fast in time, indeed

These two facts allow us to infer from (3.4) the asymptotic trend of my. By rewriting (3.4) as

. bw 2mcmwc

we observe that it is an ordinary differential equation of the form
x =a()(b(t) — x).

It is known that if a(t) is such that a < a(t) <a@ for two constants a, a> 0 and if b(t) converges
exponentially fast to a limit value b° when t + +00, i.e. |b(#) — b*| S et for t sufficiently large
and for a certain b > a@— a, then also x converges to b* as t > +00. In our case, we have x(t) =
my(t) and
