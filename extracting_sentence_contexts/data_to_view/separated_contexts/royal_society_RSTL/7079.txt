The series of observations from
0* 15' S. lat. belong in fact to the same Kind, by the alternation of stronger and weaker
sea-water in different depths; but the curious and surprising fact in the observation
from 22” 37' S. lat. is, that in the whole Atlantic Ocean we do not know a single place
where water with that quantity of salt occurs. The next specimen, from 22 37'S. lat.
and a depth of 2700 feet, is very nearly the same as that from 900 feet, and that from
5400 feet very near that from the surface of the same place. 1It appears thus that the water of the North Atlantic Ocean, between the southernmost
part of Greenland and the equator, decreases in salinity with the depth, but that this
curious fact is observed only in the middle bed of the Atlantic, and disappears when
we approach the shores on both sides of the ocean. As to the cause of this rather
surprising state, I am still of the same opinion which I expressed when I first observed
it, that it depends upon a polar under-current. 'The hypothesis has been published,
that it depended upon fresh-water springs at the bottom of the ocean, and such an
opinion might have some chance as long as we only had few observarions; but now we
have such a number of observations spread over a yast extent of the ocean, that it
appears to be quite impossible to explain it by springs of fresh water, which of course
must be more frequent and more powerful near the land, from which they have their
