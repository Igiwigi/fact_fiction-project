' Thus it will prolong the distance to which sound can
be heard against the wind, and diminish that at which it can be heard with the wind
(when the surface is rough); and when the downward diminution of temperature bears
a certain relation to the strength of the wind, it is easy to see that it may neutralize or
even reverse its effect. These facts, all taken together, appear to me to afford a satisfactory explanation of the
phenomenon observed by AraGo. There was, however, one other phenomenon observed
during the same experiments on which I will venture a word in explanation. The reports of the guns at Montlhery as heard at that station were attended with
prolonged echoes, but it was not so with those at Villejuif.
