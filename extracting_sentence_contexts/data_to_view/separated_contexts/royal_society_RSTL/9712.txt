Tf we assume, for the sake of illustration, that the potass artificially 8npplied was the
mos readily available, and that the crop relied entirely upon it 80 long as it lasted,
the result would be that only about 376 of the 900 lbs. applied, remained as residue
after the first 8ix years, and that nearly the whole of this was taken out during the
next even years. That ib was nob all recovered by that timie would appear from the
fact that in every one of the following seven years there was till considerably more
potass in the crop of plot 8 than in that without manure. If, on the other hand, we suppose that the s0il yielded up as much potass from its
own stores to the crop of plob 8 as to that without manure, there would remain at the
end of the ix years of the application 567 1bs., or nearly two-thirds of the whole
supplied till to be accounted for. On the same supposition, at the end of the next 14
years there would still remain more than 300 Ibs. of the 8upplied potass as yet
unaccounted for.
