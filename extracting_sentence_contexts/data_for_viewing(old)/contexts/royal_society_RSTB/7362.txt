source, consisting as it does of white light, would comprise green rays which are sharply
focused, and red and blue rays which are not. Further, the green rays have the greater
luminosity, the result being that a green cluster is selected for fixation. By moving the
source this fixation by a green cluster is prevented. If a continuous source of white light
be moved so that its image is continually changing its position on the retina, then even if,
by chance, that image falls on the centre of a cluster, for example, a red cluster, the colour,
which would normally be produced by that cluster, will not be seen, because repair of the
image occurs, as will be explained in Part XII (see § 162, p. 665).

If, on the contrary, the point source is an intermittent one, the process of repair is
-interrupted, and in consequence, when the image does chance to fall on a cluster the
colour produced by the stimulation of that cluster reaches consciousness. Thus we see that
the cluster hypothesis is able to account for all the facts that have been mentioned in this
section.

The above experiment with an intermittent light source, was performed with a focus
type, 3 V electric bulb, the brightness of which was controlled by means of a resistance.
The bulb had to be reduced from full brightness by being underrun—from 1-5 to 2 V
appeared to be most suitable.

Two other examples of colours produced by intermittent sources have recently been
observed, in which no physical explanation appeared to be available: sunlight reflected
trom water which was being ruffled by the wind, and light reflected from small particles
in a non-skid surface. These examples will be referred to again in Part XI.
