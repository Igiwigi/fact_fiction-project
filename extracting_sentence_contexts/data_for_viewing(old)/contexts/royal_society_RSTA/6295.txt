element software codes and more than 3600 journal articles citing the original 1972 paper [2]
and 6000 citing the related textbook [13]. Here we highlight the results of three papers.

The first, by Ogden [15], shows that for incompressible solids, each principal component of
the distortional part of the stress can be expressed as a function of the corresponding principal
component of strain only, up to the fourth order in the strain. This result may be used to justify
the separability hypothesis (1.5), up to a certain order at least.

Twizell & Ogden [16] present a systematic optimization procedure to investigate the
correlation between theory and experiments. The numerical procedure proposed improves
upon existing methods that were used to determine the material constants (;, a) as best-
fit parameters. The authors also found that the correlation between the data and the model
is casual or in some sense, spurious. This is explained by the fact that the Ogden model is
purely phenomenological and does not connect the material constants to mesoscopic quantities
or mechanical features.

As shown later by Ogden et al. [17], the curve-fitting procedure of (1.10) is a nonlinear
optimization problem and its solution is not unique for n> 2. Hence, several combinations of


material parameters exist that provide the same level of optimal fitting, but with the predictions
of the corresponding models being quantitatively different, sometimes widely. This problem is a
widely acknowledged limitation of the Ogden model.
