my increases monotonically with 42,,, we observe that a finite IR window of possible Higgs .
masses emerges as a result of the flow. In the present toy model, the centre of this window lies

in the region ~200- - -250 GeV. The lower bound is given by 42,4 = 0. Our data indicate that the
resulting Higgs mass also asymptotically approaches an upper Higgs mass bound for increasing
couplings A2,, for larger cut-offs A. In this class of bare gt potentials, the lower bound A2,, =0

is dictated by the existence of a well-defined functional integral and thus corresponds to the
criterion of absolute stability in this class.

However, the restriction to ¢* potentials is arbitrary; neither formal renormalizability
arguments nor experimental data serve to justify such a limitation. As a simple generalization,
let us consider the next higher-order operator in the potential ~ A3,,¢°. In fact, many further
operators can be (and have been) studied; see, e.g., [30,31] for higher-order fermionic operators
or [32] for mixed operators. The present simple ¢° example suffices to illustrate an important
point here. The stability criterion 42,, > 0 of the gt potentials can, of course, be alleviated by an
inclusion of a coupling 43,4 > 0. In particular, we can start with a negative 42,4 in the UV which
turns into a positive 42 at lower scales by the RG flow, while 43 becomes small according to
power counting. We observe that we obtain potentials which are fully stable on all scales but lead
to lower Higgs masses than the ‘lower bound’ obtained with 4 potentials; see figure 1b. This
demonstrates that the conventional lower bound with ¢* bare potentials can be relaxed upon the
inclusion of higher-dimensional operators at the cut-off without losing absolute stability.

Our example suggests that the conventional lower bound should be replaced by a consistency
bound defined by the smallest possible value for the Higgs mass as a function of the cut-off
