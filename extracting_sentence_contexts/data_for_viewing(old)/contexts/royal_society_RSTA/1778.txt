4. Secondary particles

Emissions of sulfur dioxide have decreased hugely in western countries over the past decades
and airborne concentrations of sulfur dioxide have reduced in a proportionate manner. On the
contrary, concentrations of sulfate appear to be nonlinearly related to SO2 emissions and have not
fallen proportionately in Europe [34], or North America [35]. Oxides of nitrogen emissions have
also reduced but far less than those of sulfur dioxide largely because of poor controls applied to
the road vehicle fleet which have only recently started to impact on NO, emissions. Nitrate has
not shown a commensurate reduction [35]. Consequently, secondary nitrates typically represent
the largest single component of PM) 5 in countries such as the UK [36]. A factor in the resistance
of ammonium nitrate concentrations to respond to mitigation measures is the fact that emissions
of ammonia, largely from agriculture, have been reduced little if at all in recent decades and high
ammonia concentrations favour the formation of ammonium nitrate particles which otherwise
would be liable to dissociate into ammonia and nitric acid gases which would be subject to more
efficient dry deposition processes [37].

While pollution by nitrates and sulfates has been well understood for many years, it still
presents significant difficulties in chemistry-transport models largely because of a proliferation
of mechanisms which are quite hard to differentiate using atmospheric measurements. However,
among emerging pollutants, secondary organic aerosol (SOA) is now receiving significant
attention. There are no wholly reliable methods of differentiating between primary and secondary
organic aerosol, but current estimates suggest that secondary aerosol comprises a major
proportion of organic particles. There has been even more difficulty in linking back secondary
