The first unfolding step interests the
peripheral regions of the domains highlighted by the red and black circles. This is caused by
the disassembling of the protein hydrophobic core formed by six B strands (816263B4B5B6). In fact,
the first unfolding interests B56, and at the other extreme, the strands B23. The new structure,
much more elongated, breaks apart when the central part of the hydrophobic core represented by
the strands 62614 cracks. The unzipping of 626, occurs as the last unfolding step, anticipated by
6164 separation.
