is preceded by a tooth having the characters, more or less strongly expressed, of a true
molar*.

Considerable differences occur in the various genera as to the relative period of the
animal's life at which the fall of the temporary molar and the evolution of its successor
takes place. In some, as //ypsiprymnus, it is one of the latest, in others, as Thylacinus,
and probably Phascolomys, one of the earlier phenomena of dental development.
Further observations on this point as opportunities occur will be interesting.

As before stated, I regard the first tooth of the molar series of the young Kangaroo
as one of the premolars of the permanent series, and not (like the tooth placed imme-
diately behind it in the first stage of dentition) as a molar of the deciduous or milk-
series. It is in fact the homologue of the penultimate premolar of Phalangista,
Perameles, Didelphys, &c. The cireumstance of its being shed at a comparatively early
period is in relation to the general conditions which, in this genus, cause the early loss
of all the teeth between the incisor and true molar series, including the canine, and even
the snccessional premolar. In Hypsiprymnus a $till more potent reason prevails for its
early removal, in the immense size of the successional premolar, which requires 80 much
more space than is occupied by its diminutive actual predecessor.

It has been usual to divide the class Mammalia, in regard to the mode of formation
and snccession of their teeth, into two groupsâ€”the 1onophyodonts, or those that gene-
rate a single set of teeth, and the Diphyodonts, or those that generate two sets of
teeth; but even in the most typical diphyodonts the snccessional process does not
extend to the whole of the teeth, always stopping short of those situated most poste-
