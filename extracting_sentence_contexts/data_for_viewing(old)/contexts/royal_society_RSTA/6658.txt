& quarter, &c., respectively, and so on, we obtain four sets of residual variations, each
commencing with the 0th hour of the lunar day ; and, taking the mean of these four,
we obtain the residual lunar diurnal variation that is left after appropriately elimi-
nating the typical variation for the four quarters. A similar procedure, using the
