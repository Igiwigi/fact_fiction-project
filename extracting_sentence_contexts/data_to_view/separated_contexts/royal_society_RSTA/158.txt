Often researchers
use either spatial or Fourier filters to eliminate the smaller scale features near the
pole in either the regular spherical grid system or the reduced grid system. In any
case, this method has some undesirable computational features that have plagued
climate modelling for decades. In fact, these problems have revived interest in the
use of Buckminster Fuller’s geodesic dome idea, in which the globe is covered with
‘nearly’ uniform triangles as shown in figure 7. Some of the earliest work carried
out in this area was by Sadourny et al. (1968) and Williamson (1968). The spectral transform method became widely used in the 1970s for solving
the dynamical equations of atmospheric climate models.
