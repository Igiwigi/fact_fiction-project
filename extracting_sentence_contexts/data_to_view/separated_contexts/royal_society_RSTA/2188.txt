and the fact that the modular difference function associated with g* is again a period integral
completely analogous to (2.16), it follows that mock modular forms indeed lead to quantum
modular forms. Moreover, the quantum modular forms arising from a mock modular form and
the Eichler integral of its shadow are clearly closely related. However, just as Ramanujan already pointed out in his original work [1], mock modular
forms inevitably encounter infinities when approaching certain rational numbers from within
the upper-half plane.
