When functions in J4 and 7g on Alice’s and Bob’s sides take some finite time t>0 to
implement, we may instead of full monoidal structure only have f4 0 ga € T if the functions f4 and
8a together take less than a given time T to implement. In this case, the notion of secrecy or non-
signalling and our results that relate to it can still be recovered for functions and concatenations
of functions that do not exceed this time-frame T.
