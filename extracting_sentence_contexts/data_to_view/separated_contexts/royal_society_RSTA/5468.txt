A literature : =
review reported 5-18% prevalence of CAD worldwide [2]. It consists of progressive stenosis : ยง
of coronary arteries, which reduces oxygen supply to cardiac cells and can lead to stroke and to
death. Stress testing is the most commonly used method for CAD diagnosis prior to coronary : <
angiography due to its non-invasive nature and the fact of being non-expensive. Nevertheless, Dh
the accuracy of conventional stress test electrocardiogram (ECG), mainly based on the analysis of : S
the ST segment, is limited, presenting low sensitivity and specificity [3-6]. In the meta-analysis 8
by Gianrossi et al. [6], sensitivities ranging from 23 to 100% (68 + 16%) and specificities from : S
17 to 100% (77 417%) were reported.
