We would avoid this machine just as we would avoid the
first (especially if it will give us the sort of misleading experi-
ences provided by the original machine), which suggests that
the constituents of welfare are not limited to our intrinsic
properties.

Of course, it is one thing to see clearly that pleasure is not
the sole intrinsic good and another to identify all others. In
what follows I will attempt to describe one further good,
then defend the possibility of posthumous harm.

in fact enjoyed from age 10 to 70. Dying young would indeed
have been bad for Socrates, but not at any particular time.

A further implication of welfare comparativism concerns
the significance of the deaths of animals: if animals of one
kind tend to have lower lifetime welfare levels than animals
of another kind, then dying will tend to be less bad for the
one than it is for the other. In effect, this is because animals
of the first sort have less to lose than those of the second.

So welfare comparativism allows us to make sense of
mortal harm. Now let us see if we can use it to make sense
of posthumous harm.
