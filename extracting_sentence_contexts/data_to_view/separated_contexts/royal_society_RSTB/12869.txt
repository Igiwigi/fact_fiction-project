The greatest debates about modularity concern the
prefrontal cortex, which can be readily divided into a few
dozen areas based on cytoarchitecture. However, the functions
of these areas remain difficult to identify definitively. In fact,
this architectural diversity raises the question of why we
have so many prefrontal regions to begin with [82]. One possi-
bility is that each region integrates new information from new
sources and participates in transforming that information via
an untangling process [79]. In this view, each area in sequence
provides a partial transformation from one representation
format to another [83,84].
