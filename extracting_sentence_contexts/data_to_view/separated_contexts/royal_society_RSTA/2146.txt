The theoretical motivation for such particles, including the link to the foundations of quantum
mechanics and GUTs makes searching for these particles compelling. Reverting to the Higgs
boson for a moment it is worth reflecting on the dual between application of quantum field theory
to condensed matter and particle physics that led to the prediction of that particle in 1964. The fact
that, in condensed matter, Dirac monopoles have been found to exist [8] is somewhat reassuring
that there might also be a particle physics analogue. Ionizing particles passing through material will lose energy with a characteristic energy loss
as discussed in [9]. Those with electric charge obey the Beth—-Bloch energy loss relation

where Na is Avagadro’s number, re is the classical electron radius, me is the electron mass, c
is the speed of light in vacuum, Z(A) is the atomic number (mass), z the charge of the incident
particles in units of the electron charge, f the velocity of the incident particle as a fraction of c,
y= J 1/(1 — B?) and Ie is the mean ionization potential of the medium.
