A set of coupled and
uncoupled multi-decadal experiments has been carried out in order to explore the impact that
the stochastic sea ice parametrization has on the mean climate in coupled compared with
uncoupled models. In the Arctic, including a stochastic sea ice parametrization in an uncoupled sea ice-ocean
model results in an increase in sea ice thickness and volume by some 10-20% (depending on
the season). This increase can be explained by the fact that the stochastic perturbations of the
sea ice strength lead to an effective weakening of the sea ice, because small stochastic values
of the ice strength are more influential than large ones. As a result, convergent sea ice drift is
enhanced, which leads to an accumulation of sea ice thickness in the central Arctic and especially
along the coastlines in the western Arctic. The first 20-30 years of uncoupled integration with the
stochastic scheme can be seen as a transient phase.
