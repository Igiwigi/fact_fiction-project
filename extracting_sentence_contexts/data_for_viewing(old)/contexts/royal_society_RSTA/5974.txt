In summary, each of the studied inequality measures above exhibits identical qualitative
behaviour, thus suggesting that the regime dependence is a robust feature in the income
dynamics.

(d) Mobility in srGBM

Measures of economic mobility quantify how income ranks of individuals change over time.
Intuitively, when mobility is high, the chances of an individual to change their position in
the income distribution over a given time period are high. By contrast, when mobility is low,
individuals are unlikely to change their rank in the distribution over time, or the changes may
happen slowly. As a means to study the drivers of economic mobility in srGBM, we consider two
standard measures: Spearman’s rank correlation and the earnings elasticity (EE). In fact, both the
rank correlation and the EE are measures of immobility, and to consider them as measures of
mobility one has to consider their complement or their inverse.

(i) Spearman’s rank correlation

Spearman’s rank correlation p;,is defined on a joint distribution of income at two points in time,
t and t + A. Mathematically, it reads
