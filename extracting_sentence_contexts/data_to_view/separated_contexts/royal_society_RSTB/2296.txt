The eleven different experiments which we have made on the static diffusion of the
highly dilute carbon dioxide of the atmosphere in what is practically a stationary
column of air give a mean value for k° of ‘158, expressed in C.G.S. units. The
values obtained by previous observers for the interdiffusivity of CO, and air for much
higher ratios of mixture, and with the gases at equal tension, are as follows :—

In the last-mentioned experiments the gases were perfectly dry, which was not the
case in our own experiments, and it now remains to be seen how far this fact is likely
to affect our results. The interdiffusivity of CO, and water vapour may be calculated from the general
formula k° (,/m,. m ) = a constant; where m, and my denote the molecular weights
of the diffusing gases.
