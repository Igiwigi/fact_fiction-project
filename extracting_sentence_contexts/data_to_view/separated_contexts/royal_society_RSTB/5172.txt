FROM THE CARBONIFEROUS ROCKS OF AUSTRALIA. 3

It was evident that the extraordinary mode of growth seen in the Cretaceous fern
Tempskya had already been anticipated, in principle, by this Paleozoic fern. This
being a result worth following up in detail, I wrote in December, 1926, to Prof. Sewarp,
drawing attention to the main features of my specimen ; at the same time I sent him
a few sketches and a slice of the block, for I had learned from Mr. Osporne that he
had also sent him a specimen, and it was possible that a comparison of the two would
bring out further facts. Prof. Sewarp’s specimen, which was much larger than mine,
not only confirmed the general comparison with Tempskya, but also yielded fresh
points of interest concerning the structure and mode of growth of this remarkable
southern Zygopterid. That the investigation of this valuable material was entrusted to me is entirely due
to Prof. Sewarp’s great kindness, of which I have had ample proof in the past, and
for which I find it difficult adequately to thank him.
