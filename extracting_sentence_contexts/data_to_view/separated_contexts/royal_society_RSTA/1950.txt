Therefore, Stokes’ pioneering experiments showed for the first
time that changes in the colour of blood were rapidly and repeatedly reversible and that exposure
to air affects these changes. There is a delightful section of the paper where Stokes makes his biological speculations. Thus: ‘I have purposely abstained from physiological speculations until I should have finished the chemico-
optical part of the subject; but as the facts which have been adduced seem calculated to throw considerable
light on the function of cruorine in the animal economy, I may perhaps be permitted to make a few
remarks on this subject’. Stokes was unaware of Hoppe-Seyler’s 1864 paper [18] in which the word
haemoglobin had been used first to describe the colouring matter of blood. He had therefore used
his own term, ‘cruorine’, for this.
