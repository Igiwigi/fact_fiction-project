THE FOCETAL INTESTINES AND LIVER. 125

intestines substances have been found similar in character to those contained
in the intestines of children, in whom no such malformation had existed

Note by Dr. ProuT.

The principal chemical facts ascertained by me having been introduced by
Dr. Lzz in the preceding paper, it only remains that I should briefly state the
manner in which these facts were determined.

'The most unequivocal test of the presence of albuminous matter that I am
acquainted with, is the prussiate of potash assisted by dilute acetic acid, as
first recommended by Bxrzervs ; and this accordingly was the test on which
the chief reliance was placed in my experiments. But the presence of albu-
minous matter was also satisfactorily indicated by other means ; as by heat, by
the oxymuriate of mercury, &. Besides the albuminous matters, however, it
may be proper to mention that others were present, to which this term, even
in its most extended sense, could not be strictly applied, and for which in the
present state of animal chemistry, it was difficult to find a precise term ; a large
proportion of them appeared to be nearly allied to mucus and bile, though they
did not exactly agree with these principles as they occur in the adult state.
