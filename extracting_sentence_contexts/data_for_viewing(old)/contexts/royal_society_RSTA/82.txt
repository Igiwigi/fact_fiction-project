kernels exist whose Fourier transform has negative values. This is the case for all stretched
exponentials G(x) « exp(—|x|P) with p > 2 [20]. Kernels satisfying this are more platykurtic than
the Gaussian function. Work is in progress on this possible route to obtaining pattern-forming
kernels.

4. Conclusion

In this paper, we have reviewed different non-local competitive models of vegetation in water-
limited regions where, despite the absence of facilitative interactions, patterns may still appear.
The obtained sequence of patterns consists of a striped structure and spots of vegetation
interspersed on the bare soil forming a hexagonal lattice. We have not been able to find patterns
consisting of spots of bare soil, which are also typical in models with both competition and
facilitation among plants. In fact, previous studies [12] in which the range of facilitation was
taken to its infinitesimally shortest value (i.e. local) showed these gapped distributions but only
in a very narrow parameter region close to the transition to patterns line. This is different from
standard models with non-local facilitation in which the whole sequence of patterns (gaps, stripes


and spots) appears in a wider parameter interval. This may suggest that facilitative interactions,
although not indispensable for the formation of patterns, could be important in order to promote
some of the structures that have been reported in field observations. We note in this context that
a careful study of the bifurcation sequences in local vegetation models reveals that the standard
sequence is not fully robust and depends on nonlinear details of particular models [21].

From a mathematical point of view, non-locality enters through an influence function that
