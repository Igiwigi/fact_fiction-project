imagination to diftate his firſt letter to Dr, Mortimer;
and that what he then ſent, he rather hoped would
prove true upon experiment, than what really was
ſo? and that his ſecond letter, in which there is fo
remarkable a diminution of what was promiſed in
the firſt, was the retreat of one, who was unwilling
to be thought to have communicated to the Royal
Society any thing, which would not upon trial come
outas he had repreſented it? But be that as it may ; as
ſucceſs both here and abroad has been wanting to the
endeavours of thoſe, who have deſired to repeat theſe
experiments, I ſhall determine nothing myſelf ; but,
from an undiſguiſed repreſentation of the facts, as
they have appeared to me, I ſhall leave every one

to deduce his own concluſion concerning the reality
of them.
