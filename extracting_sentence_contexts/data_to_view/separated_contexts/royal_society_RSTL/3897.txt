This proves how necessary it is, in order to have the 8igns of the current directed
from the tendon to the muscle, not to comprehend any portion of the interior of the
muscle in the circuit. Let us then conclude, that © touching a mass of muscle belonging to a living animal,
or an animal recently killed, with a homogeneous conducting arch, one extremity of
which is contact with the tendon of the muscle, and the other with the superficies of
the muscle itself, signs of an electric current are obtained, which circulates in the
musecular mass, its direction being from the tendon to the external surface of the
muscle.” This fact comprehends that of the proper current of the frog. Let it not be forgotten that from the sum of all our researches, it has been proved
that both the muscular and proper current are subject to the same laws, and thus in
all probability have a common origin, I would here again call the attention of ana-
tomists to the study of the structure of the muscles, and of the relation which exists
between the muscular fibres, the tendon, and the membrane which invests the fibres
or the sarcolemma. If J have rightly understood the classical labours of my friend Mr. Bowman, it
would follow that the extremities of the elementary muscular fibres are immediately
connected and continued with the tendinous fibre ; while the sarcolemma which invests
the muscular fibre ceases abruptly where the tendon begins.
