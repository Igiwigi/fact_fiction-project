The theorem, * If a variable circle have its centre upon a circle S, and its radius pro-
portional to the tangential distance of the centre from a circle C, the envelope is a
Cartesian,”
is at once deducible from the theorem—

«If a yariable circle have its centre upon a circle S and its rote proportional to the

RI Q distance of the centre from a point C', the locus is a Cartesian,”
8 which last theorem was in effect given in discussing the theory of the secondary caustic.
5 In fact, the locus of a point P such that its tangential distances from the circles C, C' are
- in a constant ratio, is a circle S. Conversely, if there be a circle C, and the locus of P
S be. a circle $, then the circle C' may be found such that the tangential distances of. P
> from the two circles are in a constant ratio, and the circle C' may be taken to be a

& point, 7. 6. if there be a circle C and the locus of P be a circle S, then a point C' may
Z be found such that the tangential distance of P from the circle C is in a constant ratio
= Z to the distance from the point C'.

Hence treating P as the centre of the variable circle, it is clear that the variable circle

-2 is determined in the two cases by equivalent constructions, and the envelope is therefore
3 the same in both cases.
