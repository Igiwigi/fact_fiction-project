This framework provides two approaches to assess emergence in practice: one can (i) test if a
given feature of interest has emergent behaviour either directly with the definition (equation 3.1)
or via the practical criteria discussed at the end of §3, or one can (ii) calculate the capacity of a
system to host any emergent feature by computing its dynamical synergy. The latter approach is
more encompassing, but requires one to use a redundancy function (see §3) and usually scales
poorly with number of parts—making its calculation in large systems very challenging. The
former approach focuses on a particular feature, but circumvents those problems allowing one
to deal with large systems. In the following, the case studies reviewed in §5a use the practical
criteria (i.e. not requiring a choice of redundancy function), while most in §5b calculate dynamical
synergy (i.e. requiring a specific redundancy function).

5This mathematical fact implies that this framework does not support phenomena that are not describable by nth-order
interactions.
