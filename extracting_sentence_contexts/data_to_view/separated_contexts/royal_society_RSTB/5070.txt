The Chelonia show a great variety of colours. In many aquatic forms the iris is very
bright and mottled with various colours, while in the land tortoises it is usually brown. Gapow* draws attention to the fact that Cistudo carolina (one of the Testudinide)
presents a remarkable case of sexual dimorphism, the male having a red iris, while the
female has a brown, one. In many of the Geckos the iris is mottled in a peculiar way, showing a striped pattern
of dark brown on a light yellow-ochre or grey background, giving a weird appearance to
the eye, especially when the pupil is closed. In Lacerta viridis (green lizard) the iris is of a brightly speckled gold colour.
