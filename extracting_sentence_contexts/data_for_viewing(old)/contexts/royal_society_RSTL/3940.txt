The object to be aimed at in perfecting a thermo-electric diagram, is to make the
ordinates of the lines (which will in general be curves) corresponding to the different
metallic specimens be exactly proportional to their thermo-electric differences * from
a standard metal (P, in the actual diagram).

102. 'The thermo-dynamic reasoning adduced above ({y 10 to 15) leads to the
conelusion ({{ 14, 15), that the convective power of the vitreous electricity is greater,
