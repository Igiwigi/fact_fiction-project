Returning to the linear equation and expressing the coefficients, the equation is

(5, 9, ZLz, y, 2)=0,

Er+1+{&=0;

and we say as a definition, that the coordinates (line-coordinates) of this line are (& n, T).

173. But the same equation, considering (x, y, 2) as constant coefficients, and (Ee)
as line-coordinates, is the equation of a point, viz. the point which is the locus (envelope)
of all those points the coordinates of which satisfy the equation in question ; and swch
point is precisely the point, the coordinates (point-coordinates) of which are (z, y, 2). In fact, if (E, », L) are considered as variable parameters connected by the equation
wH1y +&=0, then taking (X, Y, Z) as current point-coordinates, the equation
$X+1Y+ZZ=0 is satisfied by writing (x, y, 2) for (X, Y, Z); or the several lines the
coordinates whereof are (E, 1, 7), all pass through the point (a, y, 2).

174, Hence recapitulating, the equation

(5, n, 2X, y, 2)=0,
or
E&r+ny+& =0,

2) as current point-coordinates,

the equation of a line the coordinates (line-coordinates) of which are (5, 2, £); and the
same equation, considering (8, 1,

Z) as current line-coordinates, and (w, y, 2) as constant
coefficients, is the equation of a Point the coordinates (point-coordinates) of which are
(x, y, 2).

or, what is the same thing,

considering (@, y, and (E, », Z) as constant coefficients, is

175. The expression, the point («, b, c), means the point whose point-coordinates are
(a, b,c); and in like manner the expression, the line (s, B, y), means the line whose
line-coordinates are (&, 3, y). The last-mentioned expression may, without, any impro-
pnety or risk of ambiguity, be employed when we are dealing with point-coordinates ;
but it is of course always allowable, and it is frequently better, to 8ubstitute for the defi-

nition the thing Signified, and a s equation &x+By+y2=0, or
more Ly: the line «r+By+y2= - "It will be proper to do this in the following
articles, Nos. 176 to 184, which contain some formule in point-coordinates relating to
the theory of the Point and the line.
