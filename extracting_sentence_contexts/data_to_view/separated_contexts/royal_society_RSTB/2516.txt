Received March 5,—Read March 26, 1903. Tur Proboscidea form one of the most isolated groups of the mammalia, for although
it is now generally recognised that they belong to the Ungulata, they nevertheless
differ widely from all other members of that order. They are further remarkable for
the fact that, while in some respects, ¢.g., in their large size and peculiar dentition,
they are among the most specialised of mammals, in others, as, for instance, in the
structure of their feet, they are relatively very primitive. The history of such an
isolated group is necessarily of exceptional interest, and the peculiarities of the
animals themselves render it the more easy to follow the course of their development,
because the danger of confusing them with allied types is to a great extent
eliminated ; furthermore, in scarcely any other group can the phylogenetic history be
traced back through so long a series of forms. Until quite recently the earliest Proboscidea known were from the lowest Miocene
beds (Burdigalien) of France, where they are represented by at least two species, viz.,
Dinotherium cuvieri and Tetrabelodon angustidens.*
