The accurate computational oS
prediction and assignment of small-molecule catalysis to individual reactions is still infeasible, : gS
and the use of known biochemistry reveals much about the fundamental principles and network 12

structure while opening doors to future work. When more is revealed about general rules of
catalysis and complex chemical systems, it is most likely that different, larger and more versatile
autocatalytic networks will be found, and confirmed experimentally. The fact that small-molecule autocatalytic chemical networks can be found universally in :3
prokaryotic metabolism is a strong indication that they were the initial step of molecular : s
reproduction in the Universe. In the clear wording of H. Morowitz, â€˜In any case the problem must :3
begin at the beginning.
