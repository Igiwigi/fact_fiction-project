In Case (c)
we are concerned with a region of infinite extent, and the device of ‘geometrical
inversion”’ must be applied in order to render the problem tractable by relaxation

methods. For some applications we require values of the ratio h = | d(a+-7f)/d(x-+1y)| at
least as accurate as those of « or #: examples are given to show that the requisite accuracy
is attainable, use being made (when necessary) of the fact that log / is plane-harmonic. The last problem treated (calculation of the electric capacity of a straight cable or
condenser) is in essence an example of conformal transformation but can be solved
when only one of «, # has been computed. It does not demand construction of the «—/
map.
