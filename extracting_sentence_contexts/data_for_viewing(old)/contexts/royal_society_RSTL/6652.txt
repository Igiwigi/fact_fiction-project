I now proceed to explain how the intensity of the internal forces is increased by the
sliding movement of the glacier.

66. Effect of the Sliding of a Glacier on the Internal Pressures and Tensions.—It has
frequently been objected to the! sliding of a glacier, that the inequalities along the' sides
of the containing valley would: effectually prevent sweh motion. This: objection, how-
ever, will be entirely obviated, if we: eliminate the uncertain! and irregular opposing
forces arising from local lateral obstacles, by substituting for the sides of the glacial
valley two imaginary vertical planes near and approximately parallel to them, s0 that
we shall thus have the tangential action of ice along these planes as the retarding force
on the' general mass of the glacier, instead of the- action of the walls of the valley. The
greatest magnitude of this retarding force must be equal to the greatest tangential. cohe-
8ive power of the ice. This is, in fact, the greatest force which the walls, however irre-
gular, could possibly exercise in opposing the sliding past them of the general mass of
the glacier. To simplify our problem as much as possible, I shall also first suppose the
glacier of uniform width and thickness, and the inclination of its bed to be likewise
uniform. We may ther consider A and B each' =0, F-shall als suppose C=0, and
