Here, then, lodged within the densest part of the shell, is a structure richly supplied
with nerves, shut off from other parts of the body, and having communication with
the surface only through the medium of canals, which are sometimes continued into
bristles, and sometimes terminate im mere bulbs. As a prehensile organ, the claw
probably needs sensibility ; but no force which the animal could exercise could make
any impression on the parts within, through its dense tuberculated edges. On the other
hand, it is difficult to assign any office to the bristles, and still more to the bulbs,
mechanical or otherwise, except that which has been here snggested.â€”that, establish-

nervous structure, they communicate impressions to it, and are in fact tactile organs. FUNCTIONS OF THE HAIRS OF THE CRUSTACEA. 899
