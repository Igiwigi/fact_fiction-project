Here we do not explicitly write out the contributions w,, w2 and w3 to save space. Since
asymptotic solutions are constructed for large values of parameter p, the convergence of the
solution improves with increasing p.

Figure 3 shows the parametric solution (3.21) plotted for the four first contributions w;(#)
and 1;(w) (i=0,1,2,3) in the case of evolution of ellipsoidal crystals. The aspect ratio of initial

ellipsoidal semiaxes o9(s.), jyo3 (6) 1 = 3.137 is found from equation (3.11), which determines
o(s). The dimensionless parameter w represents the new modified time variable, which increases
with increasing the dimensionless time t. As is easily seen, the dimensionless supercooling w
decreases with increasing w. This is due to the fact that the growing ellipsoidal crystals release
the latent heat of crystallization and thus compensate the melt supercooling. As this takes place,
the main contributions wo and t9 show only qualitative behaviour. The next three contributions
with subscripts 1, 2 and 3 illustrate that the analytical solution converges. Note that the rate of
convergence depends on the dimensionless number p. The larger the parameter p, the faster the
solution converges.
