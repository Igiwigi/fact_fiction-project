in fact, they only observed the triplet S(2), 8, (3), S.(8) of the next and 8, (4)—too
few to give the series. The triplet $(1) was observed first by Lenmann* (more
accurately later by Hermann‘) and the series completed and arranged by SaunvErs.}
The first three are only sufficient to determine the constants with « only; in the
analogous cases of Mg, Ca, and Sr the limits so determined have all come out too
large. Here it makes the calculated values of wave numbers for 8, (4) and §, (5)
differ from those assigned by SauNDERS by amounts too large respectively by 71 and
159—in other words, the limits here, also, are much too large if his allocations are
correct. If we use his allocation of 8, (4) and attempt to find constants for 8m-* we
get a formula quite out of line with the others. The first impression is to infer that
SaunpDERS’ allocation of the two last lines is quite wrong, but a closer acquaintance
with other series gives more caution and suggests another way of meeting the
difficulty. As a fact, it is difficult to represent all the P series, and especially the
D series by any modification of the simple formule hitherto used. In the case of AID
it seems impossible to do so at all. Further, it will be shown in Part IIT. that the
atomic weight term plays a very important part in producing new lines or displacing
expected ones.

New lines are produced by the addition (or subtraction) of multiples of the atomic
weight term to the denominators in the formule which irresistibly suggest modified
molecular groupings. The full evidence for this can only come later when these lines
are being discussed, but as bearing more especially on this part of the subject it will
be convenient here to show how it enables us to explain why in the alkalies
Ryppere’s relations 8(#)=p(1) hold while the other P(«#)=s(1) does not.
