No explanation of its rhythmic character has yet been found,
agd its uses in the economy are also unknown. In the ova of osseous fishes, and in those
oZ Batrachia, its existence has been ascertained, but usually its manifestations are slow and
nalistinct. That the rhythmic contractions have no essential relation to growth in the
oFum of os8eous fishes, is shown by the fact that they do not begin until the egg has
Zached its full 8ize. I venture to suggest that they may be connected in some way
vSth the conversion of a lower form of organic matter into a higher, such as occurs

en food-yelk 1s transformed into formative yelk. It seems probable that the excep-
"4 vividness of the contractions noted in some fishes, as the pike and the stickle-
tack, is connected with the rapidity of the changes which take place in the egg.
