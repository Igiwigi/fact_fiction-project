This value for the transition temperature was obtained directly by Wannier & Onsager
by an elegant method (Wannier 1945) assuming that a single transition temperature
exists.

Examples of square surface lattices are the (1, 0,0) face both in simple cubic and face-
centred cubic lattices. An example of a triangular surface lattice is the (1,1, 1) in the face-
centred cubic lattice. In all these cases the nearest neighbour interactions in thesurfaceitselfare
the same as the nearest neighbour interactions inside the crystal. The transition temperatures
(92) or (96) for these surfaces are very high and seem to be of the same order of magnitude
or higher than the melting-point 7), of the crystal. In fact, for the solid state of the rare
gases for which a nearest neighbour interaction model can be considered as a reasonable
approximation, we find from the experimental values k7),/¢ ~ 0-7. We deduce that these
surfaces, if the crystal is perfect, must remain essentially flat for all temperatures below
the melting-point, apart, of course, from the presence of adsorbed molecules and vacant
surface sites.

Another interesting case is that of surfaces for which the nearest neighbour interactions
in the surface itself are not only first but also second nearest neighbour bonds, as, for instance,
(1,1, 0) both for simple cubic and face-centred cubic lattices. Then the surface lattice is
rectangular and the interactions are ¢, (first nearest neighbour bond) in one direction and ¢,
(second nearest neighbour bond) in the other direction. The exact partition function for this
lattice has also been given by Onsager (1944). He has shown that the potential energy (or our
