If the laws of the communication of heat from.one body to
another were known, measures might be taken with certainty,
in all cases, for confining it, and directing its operations, and
this would not only be productive of great ceconomy in the
articles of fuel and clothing, but would likewise greatly increase
the comforts and conveniencies of life; objects of which the
philosopher should never lose sight. Sir Bexjamm Trnomeson's Experiments, &c, 49

The route which I have followed in this inquiry is that which
I thought bid fairest to lead to useful discoveries. Without em-
barrassing myself with any particular theory, I have formed to
myself a plan of experimental investigation, which I conceived
would conduct me to the knowledge of certain facts, of which
we are now ignorant, or very imperfectly informed, and with
which it is of consequence that we should be made acquainted,

The first great object which I had in view in this inquiry
was to ascertain, if possible, the cause of the warmth of certain
bodies ; or the circumstances upon which their power of con-
fining heat depends. This, in other words, is no other than to
determine the cause of the conducting and non-conducting
power of bodies. To this end I began by determining by actual experiment
the relative conducting powers of various bodies of very diffe-
rent natures, both fluids and solids, of some of which experi-
ments I have already given an account in the Paper above men-
tioned, which is published in the Transactions of the Royal
Society for the year 1786; I shall now, taking up the matter
where I left it, give you the continuation of the history of my
researches.
