of the objectives for the finest possible definition of an uncoyered object.

A new fact had appeared highly suggestive of further inquiry. Accordingly, distribu-
tion of power was now varied by employing differently constructed eye-lenses, especially
© crossed lenses” *, and inserting, midway between the objective and eyepiece, conver lenses
of great variety. It was now seen that these lenses, intermediately placed, developed
an entirely new aberration of a negative kind. Tt became important to decide

* Crossed lenses, well known to give a minimum aberration having the radii of their curved surfaces
as 6:1,

+ It is convenient to define the aberration to be positive or negative, or the lens to be over- or undereorrected,
by the simple fact that a conyex lens causes the excentrical rays to cross the axis at a point nearer the
centre of the lens than the centrical rays, in which case, and in all analogous cases, it may he said that the
lens is undercorrected and afflicted with a negative aberration. English objectives are now constructed on
the principle of having the posterior scts overcorrected and the anterior underecorrected 80 skilfully as to destroy,
by opposite errors nearly, the residuary aberration ; but the opinion may be hazarded that future combinations
will yet be found which will completely throw into the shade the present powers of the microscope, when per-
haps we shall be in a better position to attempt to determine the microscopical features of molecular life, at
present probably beyond its grasp, as no single particle 80 small as the siwty-thousandth of an inch in diameter

can be dearly defined if isolated, until residuary error is very much reduced.
It is to be regretted that the precise nature of the marvellous combinations inyented by Professor Axcrct for
