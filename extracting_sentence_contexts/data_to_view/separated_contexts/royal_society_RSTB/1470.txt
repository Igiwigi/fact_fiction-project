The rest of the table gives the observed coefficients at
different grades. These coefficients in all cases agree fairly well with the theoretic
and their mean values approximate very closely to them. They are, in fact, in seve
cases identical, whilst with the exception of the value at grade 5°, they none of the
differ by more than ‘02. When we remember the variable conditions under which
larvee measured in these groups were allowed to develop, it is rather to be wondere’
that the variations in the coefficients are so small. There is thus no reason to doub
that whatever variations are produced in the average size of the larvee by changes 0
environmental conditions, the frequency of the deviations in the size from the averag
always corresponds with that indicated by the theoretical law of error.
