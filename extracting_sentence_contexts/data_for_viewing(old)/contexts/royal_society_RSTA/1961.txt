where a is the particle radius, g Earth gravity, pr the fluid density and jz its dynamic viscosity. This
law exhibits a quadratic dependence of sinking speed with particle size (dashed yellow (light) line
in figure 1a) which does not accurately account for the experimentally measured sinking speeds
of living and dead diatoms (dots in figure 12). A slightly more appropriate approximation consists
in fact in taking into account the difference in volume and density between the heavy (but thin)
silicate frustule and the light (but large) cytoplasm [31], which leads to the following modified
Stokes’ Law:

where Peyt and , are the densities of the cytoplasm and the frustule, respectively, and t the
thickness of the silica shell. If we consider t to be independent of the cell size a, this modified law
