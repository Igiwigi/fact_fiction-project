them.

spores being brought to maturity that the plant at the time can support. In
function the cells thus absorbed resemble the nutritive cells of Spherocarpus or
Riella.*

In this connection it is to be remarked how difficult of definition the sporogenous
groups are in certain cases while young. This is so in Tmesipterist and Psilotum,t
and appears to be due to the absence of a definite tapetum, and to the fact that the
definitive sporogenous cells do not form a continuous mass. Again, in Ophioglossum
the same difficulty arises in early stages; here again the groups of cells, first
recognisable as the sporogenous masses by their denser contents, are not wholly
devoted to spore-formation, for numerous isolated cells scattered through the mass are
absorbed, but in addition to this, a broad, superficial band of cells, constituting a sort
of ill-defined and broad tapetum round each of these groups, is disorganised.§ The
frequently irregular outline of the sporogenous groups in Oplioglossum, Tmesipteris,
and Psilotum, points to their not being the regular and _ exclusive ‘product of
segmentation of any single cell, or group of cells.

In heterosporous types sterile cells are commonly present in the female sporangium:
