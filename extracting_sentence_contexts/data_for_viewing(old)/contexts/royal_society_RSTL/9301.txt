A single glance at these numbers is sufficient to show that the crystalline form has
no recognisable effect on the rate. We find two cubic salts, potassium and sodium
chloride, acting in opposite directions, the one accelerating the flow by 23” and
the other retarding by 9'2”7. These it is true are salts of different metals, but g
below we have potassic nitrate and sulphate both trimetric, and yet they diverge
more widely than the two first, the nitrate accelerating the flow by 4:9”, and the
gulphate retarding by 12:3”. Solubility, too, does nob account for it, because 8odic
chloride is more s0luble than potassic nitrate, and yet it retards while the nitre
accelerates, and potassic sulphate is less soluble than sodic chloride, and retards more
than it. In fact, some series go one way and some directly opposite ; thus in the case
of barium, strontium, and calcium the latter flows least rapidly, and at the same time
is most 8oluble, while in the case of the chloride, bromide, and iodide of potassium
the first is both least soluble and flows slowest ; 80 that we 8ee that neither the
crystalline form nor the solubility of a salt materially affect the microrheosis of its
solution ; nor can the specific volume affect it, as we know that isomorphous
compounds have equal specific volumes. It appeared then that the phenomena of
microrheosis could only be affected by the mass or energy of the salt in solution.
It may be as well here to explain that as normal solutions are used, mags is
synonymous with * atomic weight,” © equivalent proportion,” or such other term,
and that when the energy of the xalt is spoken of it means the amount- of work
which can be obtained from it by suecessive combinations till it is degraded to such
a state that no more work or energy can be obtained from it, which state I deseribe
