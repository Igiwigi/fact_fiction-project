After soaking this same pair of carbons in potassium
carbonate the P.D. obtained was 1:0 volt., the resistance of the vapour being only a
few hundred ohms, so that the effect of introducing this potassium salt was to
greatly increase the E.M.F. between the carbons. If these E.M.F.’s are due to
Peltier effects, then it would seem as if the introduction of the potassium greatly
increased the thermo-electric power of the junction. The above experiment is in agreement with the fact that the back E.M.F. of the
cored are has been generally found larger than that of the solid are, as the cored are
undoubtedly contains more impurities. By varying the proportions in which the oxygen and coal gas were mixed before
burning, it was found that the highest P.D.’s appeared to correspond with the gases
being burnt in their combining proportions, so as to produce the hottest flame ;
if either gas was considerably in excess, a much lower P.D. was obtained. It is to be
noted, however, that by suppressing the coal gas altogether and allowing the carbon
to burn in the oxygen, P.D.’s up to 1°5 volt could be obtained, as before the hotter
electrode always being positive to the voltmeter.
