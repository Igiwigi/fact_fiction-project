animals with different resisting power are obviously difficult to make, but if anything
the sections examined show less degenerative change in Cat D (6 days) than in Cat E
(5 days).

Cat k.—Nerves removed 8 days after operation. Here there is a very marked
increase in the degenerative change. The transverse and longitudinal sections (figs. 20
and 21) show hardly a fibre which in some part of its course does not take on
the black stain. The enlargement of the lymphatic channels is also marked.
On referring to Table V. it will be seen that at this stage occurred the first
great fall in the percentage of phosphorus. It had sunk to half the normal.
Further evidence that not only dissociation of the lecithin molecule into its
constituent parts, but also removal of the products of'such change had begun to occur,
is derived from the fact that at this date most choline was found in the blood (see
tracing, fig. 9).

Up to this point increase in the nuclei of the neurilemma had been looked for
without success. It was now seen very well (see fig. 22).

It rather looks as though this increase in the nuclei was the result of the irritation
of the presence of degenerative products.

Cat N.—Nerves removed 10 days after the operation. The degenerative change is
still better marked. The accompanying photo-micrograph (fig. 23) speaks for itself:
A transverse section of this nerve is shown in fig. C, coloured plate.
