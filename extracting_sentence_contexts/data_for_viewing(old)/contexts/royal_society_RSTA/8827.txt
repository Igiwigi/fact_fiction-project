entirely fictitious singularities in other and important parts of the range, and makes
the formula worthless,

A good deal of light is thrown upon the problem when it is found that, if we

develop 1 in descending powers of M in the neighbourhood of M = , the two
is

leading terms are discovered to be identical with the two leading terms of the
cubic B, previously obtained. This makes our B approximate more and more closely
to = precisely as the effect of the denominator term becomes more important, and it
ss
is this fact which is the key to the numerical value of the method.

We then proceed to show how the constants for a combination of the two systems
can be obtained from the corresponding constants of the individual systems. In
doing this it appears that, so soon as we pass from the single refracting surface to

the lens, a new constant is introduced into the formula, which now takes the form

_, _ At?+Et!
where A and B are of the same form as before, but E is now a polynomial of
degree 6 in M. In the case of a lens the term E7â€˜ is found to be, in general, of
small importance, which accounts for the good fit of the empirical formula.
