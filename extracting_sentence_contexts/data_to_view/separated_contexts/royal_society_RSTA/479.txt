The results at Leighton, Great Staughton, Pertenhall,
Houghton Conquest and Tempsford fit in with the contours very well and leave little
doubt that this discontinuity is the transition from the Oxford Clay to the limestones
below it. The seismic results are not sufficiently detailed to separate the Kelloways Beds,
the Cornbrash, and the Great Oolite limestone. This identification is further strength-
ened by the fact that the refracted wave from the upper discontinuity at these stations
could only be observed at distances less than about 2000 ft., thus indicating a layer of no
great thickness. The result at Bow Brickhill is not consistent with the Cornbrash con-
tours (which give +90 ft. compared with the seismic result of 4-160 ft.). This disagree-
ment is not very serious as there is an exceptional development of limestones at Fenny
Stratford 14 miles to the west.
