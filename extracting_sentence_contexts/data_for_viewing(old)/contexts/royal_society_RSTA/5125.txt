main pilus subunits CfaB or CooA, respectively, and no distinct tip fibrillum apart from a single
minor pilin/adhesin at its distal end, CfaE and CooD, respectively [17,18] (figure 1).

(b) Adhesin function

The main role of the CU pili is adhesion to host cells. Adhesion is mediated by the tip subunit,
the adhesin, which in contrast to the other pilus components has two domains: one C-terminal
structural pilin domain and one N-terminal receptor-binding/lectin domain that specifically
recognizes carbohydrates of the hostâ€™s epithelium. In P pili, the adhesin is PapG and its lectin
domain binds the Gala-1,4-Galf moieties present in the globoseries of glycolipids on epithelial
kidney cells. The adhesin of type 1 pili is FimH and it binds to the D-mannosylated proteins
of epithelial bladder and kidney cells [19]. Generally, several CU pathway gene clusters can be
found within one specific strain, a fact probably accounting for the need for several receptors at
the different stages of infection until the final target tissue is colonized [19,20].

Several biomechanical studies on pili have shown that there is a certain flexibility in the helical
arrangement of the pilus rod which allows it to withstand mechanical stress such as high flow
forces in the urethra, while remaining attached to the host [17,18,21-24]. In addition, when the
connection between the two FimH domains is exposed to tensile forces, the lectin domain of
the tip adhesin is able to undergo drastic allosteric changes from a low- to a high-affinity state to
clamp around the mannose receptor [25,26]. The recent FimD-FimC-FimF-FimG-FimH structure
shows that the emerging FimH is in its relaxed/open clamp/low-affinity state ready for receptor
binding [27].
