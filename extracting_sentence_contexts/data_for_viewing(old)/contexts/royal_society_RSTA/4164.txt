P(x) = P(0)P(x|0) + P(1)P(x|1) + 2VP(0)P(x|0)P(1)P(x|1) cos 0. (2.2)

Here the values of probabilities P(0) and P(1) are equal to since we consider the symmetric
experimental setting of the source with respect to the slits. For the general experimental setting,
P(0) and P(1) can be taken as the arbitrary non-negative values satisfying P(0) + P(1) =1. In the
above form, the classical probability law (FTP)

P(x) = P(0)P(x|0) + P(1)P(x|1) (2.3)

is violated, and the term of interference 2,/P(x|0)P(0)P(x|1)P(1) cos @ specifies the violation. The
violation of the FTP is a consequence of the special contextual structure of the two-slit experiment
(in fact, a group of experiments). As Feynman pointed out [1], the interference formula (2.2)
involves three contexts: C;,i= 1,2, only the ith split open, and C12, both slits are open. They are
represented by corresponding quantum states.

It is convenient to discretize all variables, i.e. select some domain on the photo-emulsion screen
and set b = +, if a point appears in this domain, and b = —, in the opposite case. Thus, the state
representing context Co; can be expanded in two ways:

Iv) =a@|0) + Bll), @, BEC, (2.4)
where the state |i) represents context C;, and

IW) =xl+) tyl-), “ye, (2.5)
