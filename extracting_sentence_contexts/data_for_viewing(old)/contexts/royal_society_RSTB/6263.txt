A new observation concerns the medial fore-brain bundle, which instead of
terminating in the region of the inferior lobes passes around the outer edge of pars
rotunda of the corpus glomerulosum, turns dorsally and passes adjacent to the ascend-
ing gustatory tract as far caudal as the level of the sensory root of the trigeminal
nerve. This is apparently a mechanism whereby olfactory impulses of the second
and third order are relayed direct from the fore-brain to the cranial nerve centres.

The usual diencephalic commissures are identified as commissura transversa,
commissura minor, commissura horizontalis, commissura habenularis, commissura
posterior. One of the most unusual findings, especially in the Diaphus and
Bathypterois brains, is the exceedingly large transverse commissure. The hypertrophy
of this finds its explanation in the fact that it is a commissural system between the
highly developed tori semicirculares, which in turn are large because of the large
tuberculum acusticum and the large system of connecting fibres, the lateral
longitudinal fasciculus. The brains of Diaphus and Bathypterois clearly show that
the transverse commissure is a commissural system for the torus semicircularis, and
not an optic commissure. In the Saurida brain, on the other hand, where the optic
tectum is fairly large and the torus small, the transverse commissure is equally small.
In addition to being a commissural system, the transverse commissure has connections
with the following centres : optic tectum, corpus glomerulosum, corpus geniculatum
laterale, pars dorsalis thalami, pars ventralis thalami, and the lobi inferiores.

The commissura minor is developed best in Diaphus, where it is primarily a tectal
commissural system having lesser connections with the lateral geniculate body. The
