Another phenomenon, seen
best in etching lead in dilute nitric acid, is also of interest in this connection ; it has
already been described in the present paper (see p. 284). We there have a case of
lead dissolved from one crystal and deposited upon another crystal in its proper
orientation. Tn view of these facts, we think it must be admitted that different crystal faces,
having a different orientation of their elements, differ in solubility in the same solvent. To inquire into the cause of this difference is a further step in speculation which is,
perhaps, hardly necessary in this connection. Such differential actions may, however,
most probably be attributed to differences of electrical potential in the surfaces
involved.
