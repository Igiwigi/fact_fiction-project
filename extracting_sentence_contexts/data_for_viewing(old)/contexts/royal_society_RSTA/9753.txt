enters its own set of 3 purifying tubes; the
first half of each set is packed with small
fragments of soda-lime and the second half
: with similar pieces of calcium chloride ;
finally, the air is allowed to filter through plugs of glass wool and is then conducted
by glass tubing through one side of the balance case to the interior of the copper
cylinders which surround the pans and stirrups. The glass air-tubes were passed
through niches cut in the upper edges of the cylinders, their free ends being bent so
that the air streams were delivered centrally and downwards.

The apparatus just described enabled us to subject any objects, the masses of which
we desired to subsequently compare, to a very perfect washing with air freed from
carbon dioxide, moisture and dust ; in fact, we were now, for the first time, in a position
to weigh an object under well-defined and easily re-producible conditions. The efticacy
of the newly devised method was now put to the test ; for this purpose another pair
