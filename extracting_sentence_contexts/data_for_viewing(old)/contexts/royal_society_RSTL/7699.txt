Expiration is most probably commenced when the animal's head is near, but as yet
beneath the surface of the water, and when but a slight stratum of fluid is lying above
the outer orifices of the blowholes, which as the creature expires, combined with the

condensed halitus from the lungs being snddenly and forcibly driven upwards,
simulate a column of water; but that a large quantity of ingested fluid is got rid of
the act of expiration through the blowholes is, at least in the present instance, not
improbable, but in fact impossible, as from the mechanism of the organs engaged
was no contrivance by which the entrance of the fluid from the larynx, if present, into
the lungs or digestive canal could be preyented ; the only appearance of a recepti
cavity in connexion with the respiratory tract was the large laryngeal pouch befo
described, but from the position of the opening of this sac into the cavity of the
any fluid admitted into it must, necessarily enter the lungs and s0 snffocate the animal.

Expiration having been accomplished, the animal now protrudes its blowholes
the surface of the water; the abdominal muscles are relaxed, and the diap'
descends; the nares at the same time being opened, a stream of air enters the 1
through the larynx, the apex of which is still retained in the orifice of the posterior
nares; the thorax is likewise expanded by the action of the serrati, intercostales, and
pectoral muscles, and when the act of inspiration is accomplished the larynx descends,
