position, then on exciting the central end of either sciatic nerve for 5 seconds with
the interrupted induction current (Helmholtz side-wire), an electrical change occurs in
the cord, the surface contact becoming galvanometrically negative to the cross section.

On the cessation of the excitation, the needle rapidly returns to its original point
and, in most cases, then continues to slowly move to a position upon the opposite side
of the zero, thus indicating that the excitatory negative change only lasts as long as
the excitation, but is succeeded by a more lasting after-effect of opposite sign. This
increase in the resting ditference has been already alluded to in Chapter TV. Errors
due to any electrical escape are mimimised by the nature of the excitation, and the
position of the galvanometer electrodes (see Chapter III., Section 4); moreover
convincing proof that the effect is truly an excitatory one is afforded by the following
facts :â€”

(1.) A similar negative change occurs when, with the sciatic nerve uncut, the skin
over the foot is pinched with ivory or touched with a hot glass rod ;

(2.) A sudden change of small amount, but similar in sign, is produced when the
nerve is mechanically excited by a ligature, cut, &e. ;

(3.) Very pronounced effects of similar sign occur when, after injection of a few
drops of a 1 per cent. solution of strychnia acetate, the nerves connected with the
lower part of the cord are mechanically excited.

The electrical change in the cord is thus excitatory, and its resemblance to that in
