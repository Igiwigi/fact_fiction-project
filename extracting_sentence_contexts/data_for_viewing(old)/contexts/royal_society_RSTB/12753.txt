1. Face-touching may reflect unconscious hand-smelling

Mammalian smelling largely depends on sniffing [1-5]. This is clearly
evident in the stereotypical terrestrial mammalian behaviour of olfactory
self-investigation: we look at rodents, canines and felines, and see animals
that are often sniffing themselves or their own bodily secretions. Why don’t
we see this when we look at humans? The lay person may answer that: ‘well,
humans just don’t smell themselves like mice, cats and dogs do’. However, to
paraphrase the opening Thoreau quote, we think this lay answer reflects
what people choose to see, and if we looked at human behaviour differently,
we would in fact see an animal that is often sniffing itself. The primary hypoth-
esis that we put forth in this hybrid review manuscript is that the very prevalent
human behaviour of face-touching in fact often subserves hand-smelling, and
hence, social olfaction.
