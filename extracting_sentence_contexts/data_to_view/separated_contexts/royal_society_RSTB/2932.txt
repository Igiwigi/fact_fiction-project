The Canopy. This name may be conveniently applied to the whole of the complicated free
portion of the integument which forms the hollow, fluted dome around the plinth
and pollen-chamber. Its essential peculiarity depends on the fact that it is not a
mere sclerotic wall but a series of tangentially joined structures of considerable radial
extent and differentiation. The outer surface of the canopy entirely resembles that
of the rest of the seed, and there is no external mark indicating the actual zone at
which the integument becomes free. Its lining layer, however, is fluted and closely
invests the upper portion of the pollen-chamber.
