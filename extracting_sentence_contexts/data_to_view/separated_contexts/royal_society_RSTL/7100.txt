C. BRODIE ON THE CALOULUS OF CHEMICAL OPERATIONS. 853

am far from believing that such is the true solution of this apparent anomaly. Such a
80lution, although not absolutely precluded to us, is in the highest degree improbable;
and the facts admit of an obvious and simple explanation on the hypothesis that chloride
of ammonium is decomposed, at the temperature at which its vapour-density is 8upposed
to have been taken, into equal volumes of hydrochloric acid and ammonia, of which very
satisfactory evidence has been given *.

(2) Again, the density of the binoxide of nitrogen is 14-989, as determined by experi-
ment. If this be correct, 2 volumes of binoxide of nitrogen are decomposed into 1 volume
of nitrogen and 1 volume of oxygen ; whence, putting «2 as the symbol of the
binoxide, a? as the symbol of nitrogen, and # as the 8ymbol of oxygen,

If we now inquire, as before, whether any hypothesis as to the s8ymbols of nitrogen
and oxygen can be made which $hall be consistent with the fundamental assumption
that the 8ymbol of hydrogen is expressed by one factor, we have, putting 220+) and

Now no positive and integral solution as regards m, g, and p, can be found which shall
satisfy the first of these equations, The above equation, therefore, which expresses the
relation which exists between the ponderable matter of the binoxide of nitrogen and its
elements, is incompatible with the expression of the symbols by an integral number of
prime factors, on the assumption that the symbol of hydrogen is «.
