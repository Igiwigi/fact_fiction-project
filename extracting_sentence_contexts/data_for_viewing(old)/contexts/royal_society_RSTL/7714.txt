the inner nueleus. Whether, like STILLING, he mistook this nucleus for that of the
glossopharyngeal nerve, is not, easy to say, as he has nowhere given us any account of
the origin of that nerve. Certain it is that he had not discovered the connexion of the
inner nucleus with the true posterior root, which he evidently confounded with the stri@
medullaresJ. He corrected, however, the error which STILLING had made in describing
the longitudinal fibres in front of the grey tubercle as the primitive posterior columns
of the spinal cord, and showed that they consist of the descending root of the fifth cere-
bral nerye$.
