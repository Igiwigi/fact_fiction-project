Thus, the tendency to follow conspecifics tended to override
the innate control of migratory path selection in both the star-
lings and white storks, a pattern confirmed by Mellone et al.
[76] in their study of the migration of juvenile short-toed
eagles (Circaetus gallicus). Furthermore, juvenile storks
deprived of their social environment during migration, by
being contained until all conspecifics have left the breeding
grounds, do not migrate in their usual migratory direction
but instead show much larger directional scatter [75,77].
These studies were repeated recently using satellite tracking
technology, confirming that naive white storks rely heavily
on their social environment when selecting migratory routes
[75]. The fact that no evidence is reported in these studies for
established migratory routes changing through the presence
of juveniles suggests that social learning, rather than collective
learning, is the principal channel for transmission.

Leadership and social learning are firmly established mech-
anisms for the propagation of spatial information in eusocial
insects. In honeybees (Apis mellifera), a surprisingly small
subset (approx. 5%) of informed individuals can lead an
entire colony to a new nest site [106]. In these swarms, leaders
appear to exert influence by repeatedly flying through the
swarm in the intended direction faster than the other bees
[84]. Information is spread through eusocial insect colonies
