The twist of the beam was measured in the usual way by the two mirrors, 1 and
2, fixed to short lengths of copper wire soldered to the beam at points } and 5}in. from the

encastered end of the beam.

224 B. G. NEAL ON LATERAL INSTABILITY OF

A small correction to the applied torque was due to the fact that the free end of the beam
deflected slightly in a lateral direction when the torque was applied. This lateral deflexion
3, was measured by dial gauge 2, as shown, the correction to the applied torque being W,6,. Five torsion tests were carried out on each beam, designated A to E in each case.
