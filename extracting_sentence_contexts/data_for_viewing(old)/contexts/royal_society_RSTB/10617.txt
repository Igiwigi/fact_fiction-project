important to understand that the differences in distance prob-
ably arose because of the guidance of scene knowledge.
Previous work, such as Pomplun, Reingold & Shen’s area
activation model, has demonstrated that the planning of the
first saccade would be influenced by the distribution of plaus-
ible target locations, not just a single plausible location [27].
As such, we would expect the landing position of the first sac-
cade to be closer to plausible locations than to implausible
locations.

Another feature of the design that undoubtedly contribu-
ted to faster search times for targets in final likely locations
was the fact that final likely locations were closer to the
centre of the display than unlikely and implausible locations
[28]. Both of these distance effects contribute to the search
time results, but they cannot explain why successive fixations
in the trial did not approach targets in implausible locations
but did approach targets in likely and unlikely locations. The
most parsimonious explanation of the fixation distances is
that in the implausible condition, observers were actually
searching likely locations for the target.

Thus, when we ‘toyed with the cat’ (participants) by
‘moving the mouse’ (the target), participants were more
likely to seek the target in locations that were plausible for
