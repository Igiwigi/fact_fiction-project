The two
cartilages diverge slightly anterior to the symphysis, and each ends freely. Posteriorly
Meckelâ€™s cartilage is linked with the auditory region (see below). As is well known, the auditory capsule in the Cetacea is readily separable from the rest
of the skull in the adult, owing to the fact that the fused petrosal and tympanic are attached
to the other bones by membrane only. In the foetus, however, before ossification in any
part of the capsule has occurred, the cartilaginous capsule is linked with other parts of the
chondrocranium at the following points:

(1) Antero-laterally by the orbito-capsular commissure (occ) joining the orbital cartilage
with the lateral wall of the auditory capsule.

(2) Laterally and on the dorsal or cranial side by the prefacial (supra-facial) commissure,
linking the side wall of the skull with the auditory capsule, anterior to the entrance of the
facial nerve into the aqueductus Falloppii, and continuous laterally with the orbito-capsular
commissure. This is shown, but not lettered, in figure 3.

(3) Laterally and ventrally by the lateral prefacial commissure, joining the tegmen
tympani with the auditory capsule, the cavity in the cartilage between 2 and 3 known as
the cavum supracochleare being occupied by the facial ganglion and the palatine branch
of the facial nerve (see figure 4).

(4) Postero-laterally by the parieto-capsular (postfacial) commissure (fcc), forming the
antero-lateral boundary of the foramen lacerum posterius, and joining the parietal plate
and the capsule posterior to the internal auditory meatus.

(5) Posteriorly by the basivestibular commissure (vc), forming the mesial boundary of
the foramen lacerum posterius, and running longitudinally instead of transversely as in
most mammals.
