The distillation of the blue triple salt, composed of molybdic
acid, muriatic acid, and ammoniac ($ VII. and IX.), places
this in a stronger light ; for whenever this salt was distilled,
a certain portion of molybdena was left in the retort de-
prived of oxygen, and muriatic acid was found in the receiver. Moreover, from several repetitions of this experiment, I am
well convinced, that by a great number of sublimations the
whole of the molybdzna might have been obtained in the pro-
portion that the muriate of ammoniac was decomposed. When all these facts are considered, it appears to me more
than probable that most, if not all, of the ammoniacal salts
suffer different degrees of decomposition whenever they are
treated in the dry way. As the molybdic acid was my principal object, I did not
make all the experiments I could have wished on this neutral
salt ; neither have I as yet exactly determined the proportion
of azotic gas produced from a certain quantity. I have found, however, that the sublimed undecomposed
part of the salt amounted to 18g grains when an ounce of the
salt had been. distilled, and that the liquid in the receiver
weighed 145 grains; so that 152 grains had escaped, which

principally consisted of azotic gas, together with some sul-
phureous acid, and some alkaline gas, which had made their
way out of the vessels during the operation.
