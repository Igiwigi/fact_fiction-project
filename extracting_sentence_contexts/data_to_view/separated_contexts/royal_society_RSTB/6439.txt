On the
whole, this difference in the origin of the labrum cannot be shown to have any
phylogenetic significance. The determination of the morphological significance of the labrum is not easy. The fact of its wide distribution (insects, Myriapoda and Crustacea) would seem
to leave no doubt that morphologically the labrum is not an unimportant structure. It is also practically certain that the labrum of insects is homologous with that of
Scolopendra and very probably also with the labrum of the Trilobites and the
Crustacea. Whether the labrum is appendicular or not has beer much discussed.
