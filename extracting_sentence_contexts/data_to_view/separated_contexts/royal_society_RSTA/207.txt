kinetic energy to fuse. This gas is in fact a plasma since, above a few thousands
degrees, inter-atomic collisions knock the electrons out of the atoms to form a
mixture of separated nuclei and electrons. In the temperature range 100-200 million degrees Celsius the fusion power per
unit volume (Prusion) from a D-T plasma is given roughly by

Prusion ~ 0.08P? (MWm"*), (3.4)

where P is the plasma pressure in atmospheres. It is immediately clear from
equation (3.4) that the D-T reaction produces commercially viable power
densities (megawatts per metre cubed) at practically sustainable pressures
(a few atmospheres).
