ARBACIA, ECHINARACHNIUS AND LEPTASTERIAS. 321

Echinarachnius agrees with Echinus and Arbacia, but differs from Hchinocardium
in that oculars IV and V arise each in connection with a remnant of larval spicule.
Genital 5 is not transformed into an anal plate as in Echinocardium, but is entirely
lost, as are also genitals 1and3. The fusion of genitals 2 and 4 is unusual and is confined
apparently to the Clypeastride ; no evidence for any fusion of plates is at present
forthcoming either in the Regularia or in the Spatangoide.

Regarding the problem of evolution within the class Echinoidea, some of the facts
brought forward in the papers on Echinocardium (Gorpon, 1926, 6) and on Echinarach-
nius, particularly those concerning the apical system, are not quite in keeping with the
conclusions arrived at from the paleontological approach as to the phylogenetic relations
of the Irregularia, especially of the Clypeastroida. These will be discussed below.
The writer, having no first-hand knowledge of paleontological data, is not in a position
to make any very definite contributions to the problem of the internal evolution of the
class, and can only venture to submit a few tentative suggestions as to the possible
phylogenetic significance of some of the embryological data.

Hawks (1912, a, 1912, 6), in his work on the apical system in the Holectypoida,
seems to have made use of two postulates that, in the light of embryological data now
at hand, prove to be erroneous. In the first place, it is assumed that genital 5 is entirely
