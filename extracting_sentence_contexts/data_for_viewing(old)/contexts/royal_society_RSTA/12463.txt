be assumed a function of I, as well as of ¥. Though this is probably much too

simple a theory for the explanation of all hysteresis phenomena, yet I believe it could
be made to account for nearly all the known facts.* But, at present, even if this
simple assumption were made, we are very much in the dark as to how I, varies with
H and ¥, and are compelled to fall back on such pure conjectures as are illustrated in
the foot-note. To mention only one thing—nearly all the detailed experiments on
hysteresis deal only with variations of H parallel to itself.

73. Thus it is useless to attempt a satisfactory theory of hysteresis at present,
though we can see vaguely how, perhaps, in the future it may be made to fit into the
present theory.

But these considerations show that we must be very cautious in discussing resulis
which depend upon the form of J in terms of H, for they imply that we are very
ignorant of this form, even when we know how I varies with H under assigned
