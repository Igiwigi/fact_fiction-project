Assertion: => R, ie. the body is empty. When R contains no variables the assertion is called
ground. These ground assertions represent the facts of T and the members of T(PS) and
F(PS). Goals: Qi A...A Qm =>, i.e. the head is empty. These usually arise from the negation of the
conjecture to be proved and from subsequent subgoals in a derivation.
