'= accelerated by heat*. It is doubtful, however, whether these results are due to direct
action upon the pigment-cells; for in the tree frog, as well as in the English kind, the
= pale tint was not confined to the precise spot operated on, but affected a limited area
S of 8wrrounding tissue; whence it seems likely that it is developed through the medium
2 of a local nervous apparatus contained in the skinf. If this be true, we have no proof
2 that the pigment-cells are capable of being stimulated except by nervous influence,
E although they are, as we have seen, peculiarly susceptible of suspension of function
S through the direct operation of irritants upon them.
S With regard to the nature of the change experienced by the tissues when temporarily
D deprived of power by irritants, the primary increase of motion of the cilia, lapsing into
SE quiescence, under the operation of heat, may suggest the idea of exertion followed by
8 exhaustion. But that the state of incapacity is not dependent on previous action, seems
= elear from the fact that in the pigment-cells it is maintained and aggravated by an irri-
& tant continuing in operation after complete suspension of function has been induced, the
= ame kind of effect being still produced upon the tissues which are unable to act as upon
s healthy parts. As an illustration of this, I may revert to the results of immersion of an
5 amputated limb in arated water. The carbonic acid, as we have seen, entirely pre-
A * This observation was made as follows :—On the 2nd of December, 1857, having amputated the legs of
a dark frog, I put them both into water of 100* Fan., but removed the left limb within six minutes of its
immersion and placed it in cold water, leaving the right for a quarter of an hour longer, at the end of which
time it was considerably paler than the left, and the microscope showed that its pigment was more concen-
trated. But while the warm water had accelerated the process of concentration up to a certain point, it had
ultimately paralysed the pigment-cells and rendered them incapable of further change ; 80 that the right
imb remained permanently of the same colour as when removed from it, whereas in the left, which had been
Subjected for a much shorter time to the noxious agency,” concentration continued to adyance, 80 that in
