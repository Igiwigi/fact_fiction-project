Dog-trap
Road, Paramatta, Australia. (See © Batr. Sal.,” p. 89 ; Dr. GixTaes there
remarks that, *this species is very probably the type of a separate genus, but
the condition of this single specimen does not enable me to give the characters
with certainty.” The fact of the case is, that the skull of this specimen is
extremely membranous, as much 80 as in that of Aeris Pickeringit (ee
Plate 19, figs. 6-10, and Plate 30, figs. 1-5). The Rappia from Lagos had,
on the contrary, a highly ossified skull, with a well-covered roof (se Plate 28,
figs. 6-10). Second Family. © HyLopipa.”

(I make up this family of Professor MrvART's 8ub-families AcrIDINA and HYLODINA.)
No bone in the manubrium (© omosternum”).
