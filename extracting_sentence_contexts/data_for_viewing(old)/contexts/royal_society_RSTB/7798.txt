Whorls moderately convex in outline, with a circumsutural cord or collar which is
followed anteriorly by a concave band, these two features not occupying more than one-
third the height of the whorl. Height of whorls about half their width; they are slightly
stepped, and the linear sutures are deeply incised. Ribs forming small nodes on the
circumsutural cord, a little weaker over the concave band, stronger again over the main
convex portion of the whorl; they are fairly fine, of about the same width as or slightly
narrower than their intervals, slightly retrocurrent as a whole, gently convex anteriorly,
vaguely concave posteriorly, and number 17 on the last whorl preserved. Spiral ornament
apparently almost completely absent, there being only a few traces of very fine, closely
spaced spiral lines on the flank of the last whorl.

Last whorl preserved only moderately high, the periphery subcarinate on account of the
presence of a false basal disk which owes its presence to the fact that later whorls have been
broken off. The ribs, over the remainder of the whorl, similar to those of the spire whorls,
continue as obscure ridges over this basal area. Base of body whorl, represented by the
basal disk, declivous and flattened. Aperture apparently oval, the inner lip gently
excavated, and a low columellar fold present.

Dmensions. Holotype: height 1-t mm.; width 0-5 mm.

Remarks. The characters of this species, as described above, seem to be unique.
