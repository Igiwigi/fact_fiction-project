1 & 3), was moved. A reference to Plate VI., which contains
a fac-simile of my hand-drawings, and also a representation of the position-lines, will
render clear the following explanation. Four principal lines on the glass plate formed a
tangential square calculated to enclose exactly the moon's disk, which in fact it accom-
plished with great precision ; four other lines surrounded the first s8quare at the distance
of exactly 1' of arc; and a third series formed a third s8quare at the same distance from
the second. Joining the angles of the squares were two diagonal fainter lines, which
served to measure angles of position, while the several squares s8erved to measure
distances. The angles of the tangential square may be designated A, B, C, D.
