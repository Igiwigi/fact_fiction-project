Equally 0/08 will predominate over y-/dx in the expression (22) for p’2q’, so that without
serious error* we may suppress the «-differential to obtain

waey =p'q. (25) ©

* Here, in fact, the error is of second order when (@y/8x)/(@/r/2B) is small (cf. § 22). METHODS APPLIED TO ENGINEERING PROBLEMS 375

w eliminating dy/02, we have approximately
q = p'q'x?
