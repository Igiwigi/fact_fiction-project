The question remains: how useful are temperature sensitivities for flood projection? One
can envisage that, in a small (urban) catchment, where flooding is largely pluvial, and
antecedent conditions do not play a large role in modulating flooding, then precipitation-
temperature sensitivities may be directly translated to flooding (§2c). Furthermore, as Collins
[139] demonstrates, different mechanisms will be responsible for changed flooding in different
seasons. Hence, where flooding generally occurs in a ‘rainy’ season, then again it may be
that precipitation-temperature sensitivities (if valid) are sufficient for flood projection [78,140].
But outside these scenarios, changing antecedent conditions need to be integrated into the
flood-temperature sensitivity for flood projection.

(b) Evaluation of flood-temperature sensitivities with historical trends

Using precipitation-temperature scaling for flood projection is supported by the fact that global
historical increases in annual daily maxima match the expected increase by the Clausius-
Clapeyron relationship and these increases in precipitation should increase flooding. But as
presented in §2c, the transferability of precipitation scaling to flooding is fraught because
infiltration losses have a nonlinear influence on the proportion of rainfall that appears as
runoff. The (lack of) transferability of precipitation-temperature sensitivities to flooding is
illustrated using the example of southeast Australia. Annual maxima flooding has been
historically decreasing [9,17,141], while precipitation extremes have been increasing [135], and
the precipitation-temperature sensitivity is indeed positive [64]. The precipitation-temperature
sensitivity is not transferable to changes in flooding due to decreasing soil moisture modulating
flooding in this region [17]. But the peak-flow sensitivity to temperature is negative in this
