margin. These organs are unjointed structures measuring 0°8 mm. in length; they
taper somewhat distally and are terminated by a tuft of short setee (vide text-figs. 4
and 5). Arising from beneath the tenth tergum are the anal cerci (a.c.), which are
movable appendages measuring 1°7—2 mm. in length and composed of six or, in some
instances, seven joints. These are related to one another in length in the proportion
of 13:6:7:9:8: 12, the first and terminal joints thus being the longest. In some
specimens the first joint exhibits a division into two separate elements, the cerci then
being seven-jointed. Female soldiers (text-fig. 4) differ in possessing only eight

apparent sterna. This is due to the fact that the seventh sternum is very large and
entirely overlies the eighth sternum, which is small and membranous. Sub-anal
styles are present as in the male soldiers, and are carried similarly by the ninth
sternum; the cerci do not exhibit any sexual differences. Adopting, with some
modification, the method of BrrLEsE (1909, p. 275), the abdominal segments in the
