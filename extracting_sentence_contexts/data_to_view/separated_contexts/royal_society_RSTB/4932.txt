However, that there is normal anastomosis between the horizontal and vertical
systems in the spruce stem we have not been able to demonstrate. Though the material
we studied was carefully embedded in celloidin, the walls of the cells in the region of what
might be the junction point were so thin that they might be broken easily and certain
of the delicate cells pulled away in sectioning. This and the fact that we have
often found the two systems with their cavities separated have made us doubtful as to
the occurrence of normal anastomosis. For example, Photo. 18 (Plate 9) illustrates
a common condition. Here the small horizontal cavity, above, is separated from the
vertical by a long thin cell which is more or less broken towards the right.
