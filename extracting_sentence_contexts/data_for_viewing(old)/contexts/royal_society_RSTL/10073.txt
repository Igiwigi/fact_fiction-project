In this calculation the error due to the principal magnet having been necessarily
placed ab a different level from that of the suspended magnet is ignored. As a matter
of fact a relatively considerable correction is required. If 6 be the altitude of one
magnet as 8een from the other, the observed effect is too 8mall in the ratio (1â€”3) :1.

For the first and 8econd series of spinnings the distance from mirror to scale was
measured exactly as described by Dr. ScgusTER (p. 126 of former paper). The value
adopted for the second series, after correction for the thickness of the glass window in 5
