as low as possible; and of course no jar was used, its presence in the circuit being
Snstantly felt by the introduction of large numbers of metallic lines and the disappearance
df the banded spectrum.
S The drawings were made from readings of the scale of the Steinheil spectroscope, and

then approximately laid down on a scale of wave-lengths.

= GENERAL STATEMENT.

E These and other facts which I have obseryed can be included in a general statement
Such as the following.
= 1. A compound body, such as we have been considering, has as definite a spectrum as
Za 8imple one; but while the spectrum of a simple metal consists of lines, the number
> and thickness of some of which increase with molecular approach, the spectrum of the
E compound consists in the main of channelled spaces and bands, which increase in like
Z manner. In $hort, the molecules of a simple body and a compound one are affected in
& the same manner by their approach or recess, in s0 far as their spectra are concerned ;
S in other words, both spectra have their long and 8hort lines, the lines in the spectrum of the
Ss element being represented by bands or channelled lines in the spectrum of the compound ;
E and in each case the greatest simplicity of the spectrum depends upon the greatest sepa-
= ration of molecules, and the greatest complexity (a continuous spectrum) upon their
nearest approach.
