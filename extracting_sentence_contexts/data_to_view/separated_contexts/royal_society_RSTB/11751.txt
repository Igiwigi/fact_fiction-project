Similarly, authors noted that are not reasons for or against all uses of genome editing in

using gene drives to control agricultural pests could be a animals. Instead, they point to possible conditions for the


responsible use of these technologies. For example, the fact harms and risks in question and argue why the harms out-

that genetically modified (non-gene drive) mosquitoes weigh the benefits or vice versa. The principle of
could potentially cause negative consequences by spreading subsidiarity entails that a policy should only be adopted if
the modified gene beyond the target population, could lead there is no less harmful policy that would achieve the same
to the requirement that, among other conditions, a first trial result. This principle suggests that applications of genome
site be geographically isolated, such as an island [102].
