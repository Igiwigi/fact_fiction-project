In this little
Aphrodite a vessel may be seen, carrying a colourless fluid, in contact with and parallel
to the ventral nervous chord, slowly undulating with pulsations. Practically this fluid-
system is wanting in the Aphroditade ; it can therefore play no part in the generative
functions. As will be snbsequently shown, this fact, added to a mass of others, will
compel the morphologist to admit a close zoological affinity between the aberrant

Annelids and the Asteriadea and Echinidea among the Echinoderms. T2
