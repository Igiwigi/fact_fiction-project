of which is maternal blood. Close to the mesoblast the meshes are wide and the
trophoblast is thinner; in the deeper layers the meshes are small. In fact the

found. This is less cavernous, stains more lightly, contains some very large nuclei,
and shows less cell division. The chief advance of this specimen beyond the first described one consists in the
growth of the allantois so as to surround the whole embryo, and the development ot
the allantoic villi.
