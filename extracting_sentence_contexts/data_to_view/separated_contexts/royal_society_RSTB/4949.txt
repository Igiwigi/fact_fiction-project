Mesenteries common to two polyps may retain the same
coupling or be differently coupled ; those of directive couples retain the same disposition
in both polyps or are differently coupled in one polyp, with or without reversal of pleats. In buds the normal number of principal couples is reached when they are small, whilst
subsidiary couples are added until the adult condition is reached. The presence of well-developed filaments on the margins of mesenteries of an extra-
tentacular diverticulum of Favia hululensis (fig. 22 B), before the formation of a stomo-

deeum, is a significant fact bearing on the question of the origin of mesenterial filaments. VOL, CCXIV.â€”B, 24%
