COMPARATIVE INVESTIGATION OF APICES 587

be conjoined (figures 4, 5), and a small medullated protostele, with a more or less complete
cylinder of tracheides, is seen to be the effective vascular system of the new shoot (figures
6, 7, and figure 38, plate 32). At the time of fixing, this shoot had given rise to seven new
leaves (figure 8), the small protostele (ss) being traceable as undifferentiated prestelar
tissue to a level just below the apical meristem. As with Osmunda and Todea, a notable
feature in Angiopteris was the reduction in the size and anatomical complexity of the new
shoot which developed from the isolated apical meristem. In its morphological develop-
ment the new growth, in fact, approximated closely to a young sporophyte plant or a young
lateral shoot bud (Wardlaw 19466). The other experimental materials of Angiopteris which
were sectioned showed closely comparable developments, e.g. the polycyclic dictyostele
was reduced to a medullated protostele (figures 36, 37, plate 32).

(c) Pteridium aquilinum

This leptosporangiate fern is characterized by a dorsiventral rhizome and by a vascular
system of some complexity. The shoot apex is small, sunken and delicate and surrounded
by mucilaginous hairs. Many of the apices which were incised above the region of the
mucilaginous hairs became necrosed or rotted. However, in a small number of apices in
which the incisions just avoided the delicate apical meristem, growth continued and a short
length of shoot was formed.
