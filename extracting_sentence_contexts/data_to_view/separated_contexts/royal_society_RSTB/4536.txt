The principal distinguishing features in the external morphology of sexual forms

3 and sterile castes concern the shape and size of the head~ and mouth parts, the

5 presence or absence of wings and the condition of the eyes. Since we can have no

8 conception, in the absence of experimental evidence, as to what the various allelo-

3 morphs are likely to be, it is necessary to consider the distinctive characters of each

Sof the three castes in toto as collective entities ; or, in other words, to deal with

quantitative rather than qualitative segregation. Furthermore, this method of

= treatment receives justification from the fact that these various characters are

g intimately correlated and linked together. We do not find, for example, the giant
mandibles unless accompanied by an increase in the size of the head and the absence

3 of wings. Nor do we find the modified tentorium without the presence of an elongate

§ labium, and both these features are, in their turn, correlated with the enlarged head
and mandibles.
