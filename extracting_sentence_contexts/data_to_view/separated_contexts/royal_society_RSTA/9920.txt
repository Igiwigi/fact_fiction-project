If the
heating is continued beyond 610° C.—for example to 640° C. as in 72—irreversible
effects are produced (shown by the magnetic behaviour on cooling). This is interesting
as showing that the change of internal structure begins below the temperature of
maximum permeability of the material as a whole. (Cf. Section IV., § 8, p. 63.)

The fact that the loss of magnetism is very gradual in nickel-iron alloys instead of
being very sudden as in nearly pure iron is clearly in accord with the theory of the
process by which the alloys lose their magnetism. In iron the temperature at which
the permeability becomes practically indistinguishable from that of the air is only a
few degrees above that at which dy/dé first becomes negative. In each of the alloys
there were about 130° C. between the aa temperatures. (Cf.
