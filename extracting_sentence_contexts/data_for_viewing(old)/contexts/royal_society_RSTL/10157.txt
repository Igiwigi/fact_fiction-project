25. Attention was now turned to the 8olution filtered from the insoluble double
sulphates from cerite (22). Potash in excess was added to the filtrate, and the
floceulent precipitate filtered off, and after well washing was converted into sulphate,
and tested in a radiant matter tube. The spectrum, of extraordinary brilliancy, was
far brighter than any I had hitherto obtained. Unfortunately, however, the quantity
was too 8mall to be subjected to very searching chemical analysis.

Examination of thorite and orangnte,

26, Search was next made amongst other minerals rich in the rarer earths.
Thorite, another disputed mineral, was finely powdered, treated with sulphuric acid,
and tested in the radiant matter tube. It gave the citron s8pectrum most brilliantly
—equal, in fact, to the mixture of earths obtained from zircons (18, 21) at 80 great an
expenditure of time and trouble. Orangite treated in the same manner gave almost
as good a spectrum. Pure thorinic sulphate prepared by myself was found not to
give the citron band, but three specimens prepared and given to me by friends all
gave it, 80 it was not unlikely that in thorite and orangite might at last be found a
good 8ource of the long-80ught element—that in fact the body I was hunting for, if
not thorina, might possibly be Bank's hypothetical wasium. Having obtained about
2 1bs. of orangite and thorite, they were worked up as follows :—

27. The finely-powdered mineral was heated for some time with strong hydrochloric
acid, and when fully gelatinized and all action had ceased, it was evaporated to
dryness to render the ilica insoluble ; then extracted with water slightly acidulated
with hydrochloric acid, boiled, and filtered. Hydric sulphide was passed through the
