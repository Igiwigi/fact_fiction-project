gradually ascended. A bubble of the size of a large mustard-seed was left in the ex-
tremity of the tube, and I was much gratified at finding that when this was caught by
a lighted match at the surface of the water-trough it detonated. The experiment was
then repeated, continuing the ignition for a longer time, but the gas could not be in-
creased beyond a very limited quantity ; indeed it was not to have been expected, as
8upposing it to be mixed gas, recombination of the excess would haye taken place,

and the fact of any uncombined gas existing when exposed to incandescent platinum,
will donbtless surprise those who hear it for the first time.

The experiment was repeated as at firs and the bubble transferred to another
tube; the wire was then again ignited in vapour, another bubble was instantly formed
and transferred, and 80 on, until after about ten hours' work sufficient gas was col-
lected for analysis ; this gas was now placed in an eudiometer, it detonated and con-
tracted to 0-35 of its original volume ; the residue being nitrogen. The experiment
was repeated several times with the same general results, the residue sometimes con-
taining a trace of oxygen.

Here electrolysis was out of the question ; the wire was ignited in (if I may use the
expression) dry steam, the upper part of the tube being far above the boiling-point,
