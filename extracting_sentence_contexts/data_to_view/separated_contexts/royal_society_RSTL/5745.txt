d—M |

M*—(a+d)M+ad—be=0,
and let X,, X, be the single quantities, roots of the equation
c - 4—X |
or
X*—(a+4d)X +ad—be=0. The equation satisfied by the matrix may be written
(M=X,(M—X,)=0.

in which X,, X,, are to be considered as respectively involving the matrix unity, and it
would at first sight seem that we ought to have one of the simple factors equal to zero,
which is obviously not the case, for such equation would signity that the perfectly inde-
terminate matrix M was equal to a single quantity, considered as involving the matrix
unity. The explanation is that each of the simple factors is an indeterminate matrix,
in fact M—X, stands for the matrix

( a—R, b I:
| ec , 4d—X,

and the determinant of this matrix is equal to zero. ' The product of the two factors is
thus equal to zero without either of the factors being equal to zero. 29.
