Disturbed days in Table VII. include all of “ character ” 2 or 1, those of “‘ character”
0 being called quiet ; so that the sum of the disturbed and quiet together necessarily
amounts to 660. The distribution one would have had in 660 average days appears
under “normal.” As regards the number of 2’s, days +27 and —27 decidedly over-
top their neighbours. The incidence of 2’s in the pulses is more alike if we invert
the order of days in the previous pulse, 7.e., regard days —25 and +25, &c., as
corresponding. But in both pulses the marked tendency is for days of moderate
disturbance to follow the crest. No significance probably attaches to the fact that 2’s
are slightly more numerous in the previous than in the subsequent pulse ; because,
while the highest “ character” figure in the first previous pulse exceeds that in the
first subsequent pulse in the case of the 11-year period, it does not do so in the
6-year period.

§16. Table VIIL., p. 265, represents the results of an enquiry into the possible varia-
tion of the 27-day period throughout the year. The 11-year and 6-year periods were
treated separately. The 660 selected days of the former period gave 55 January
days and so on. These 55 January days and the subsequent days associated with
them are treated as a separate group in Table VIII. The first two columns give the
mean character figures for the selected disturbed days of the 12 months, for the two
periods. Columns 3 to 8 give the mean character figures for days 25 to 30 subsequent
