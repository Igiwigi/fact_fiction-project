In planning the final experiments it was decided that the operations of weighing
should be simplified as far as might be consistent with the conditions demanded for
the high degree of accuracy to which we hoped to attain; the method of double or
reversed weighing was therefore, in our opinion, with advantage discarded, for in this
present enquiry a knowledge of the absolute weights of the reacting bodies is
inconsequent. The question which we were endeavouring to answer was an
apparently remarkably simple one, namely, Does the total mass of two or more
interacting bodies undergo any appreciable change during chemical reaction? Now
Lanpotr had already shown that if such changes take place they must be so small
that there would result but a very slight displacement in the R.P. of a balance
adjusted to a high degree of sensibility ; in fact, so slight was any possible displacement
likely to be that for the final comparison it would be quite unnecessary even to change
the position of the rider upon the beam. CHANGE IN WEIGHT DURING CHEMICAL REACTION. 249

From the results obtained during the wiping of a charged flask (vide supra), it was
inferred that the less frequently we repeated the operation of wiping the reaction
vessels, the greater would be the reliability of final results drawn from a whole series of
experiments. Again, the oftener the balance case is opened the greater will be the
risk incurred from falling dust, varying temperature, and moisture effects ; and with
oft-repeated reversals we incur the further danger due to possible minute alterations in
weight brought about by the friction between the hooks of the reaction vessels and
those of the balance stirrups.
