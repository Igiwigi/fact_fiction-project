48. For an octavic, the number of the asyzygetic invariants of the degree 0 is

and the second factor of the numerator is
(I-2"(I=20=2"(=&)(L=0)(=d)(L=D)(I=D)(I=")(=2")..
where the series of factors does not, terminate, hence the number of irreducible inva-
riants is infinite. Substituting the preceding value, the number of the asyzygetic
invariants of the degree 0 is
eoeff, a%in (1=2)—(1—2)-(1—2)=(1=0)=(1—29) (12) (1-2) (1=2)(1-29-(1-2")(1-27X1—3
There is certainly one, and only one irreducible invariant for each of the degrees |
2, 33, 4, 5 and 6 respectively ; but the formula does not show the number of the irre-
ducible invariants of the degrees 7, &c.; in fact, representing the irreducible inva-
riants of the degrees 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 by X,, X,, X,, X;, X;, these give rise to 3 com-
posite invariants of the degree 7, viz. X,X,X,, X,X,, X,X,, which may or may not be
connected by a syzygy ; if they are not connected by a syzygy, there will be a single
irreducible invariant of the degree 7; but if they are connected by a syzygy, there will
be two irreducible invariants of the degree 7; it is useless at present to pursue the
discussion further.

Considering next the covariants,—
