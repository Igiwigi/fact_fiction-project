The estimated circulation
round IAB just above the nose was found to be — 0-25; but this is almost certainly
in error on account of uncertainties in the measurement of velocities along IB. In
this neighbourhood only the observations with a hot wire were of any value at all, and
the velocities so measured may easily have been 5 per cent. in error, which fact,
together with possible errors in direction, is sufficient to account for the whole of the
calculated circulation. Again, the circulation round JGH was 0-030; but,
unfortunately, possible errors of observation in the neighbourhood of J were large
enough to account for a great deal of this. The general conclusion, however, may be
drawn that circulation close to the aérofoil is appreciably less than that around larger
contours, and in all probability is zero on the aérofoil.
