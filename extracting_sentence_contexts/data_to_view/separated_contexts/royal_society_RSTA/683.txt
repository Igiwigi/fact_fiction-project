We observe that the more thermostable
the protein, the easier it is to destabilize with point mutations. Indeed, the mean ATm for the
point mutations introduced in thermostable proteins (Tm < 50°C) is 3°C smaller compared with
those of hyperthermostable proteins (Tm > 80°C). This effect is increased to about 4°C for the
mutations introduced in the protein core due to the fact that thermostable proteins have usually
a more compact structure. Instead, in the surface region, the difference between thermostable
and mesostable proteins is reduced, even though the difference in AT remains significant:
about 1.5°C. We then used the protein-level predictor HoTMuSiC introduced in §4 to evaluate the changes
in stability of these 1600 mutations.
