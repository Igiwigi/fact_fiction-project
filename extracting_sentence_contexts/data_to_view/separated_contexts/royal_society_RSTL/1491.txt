On such an'abstruse” question, however,
there can be na,demonstrative evidence.” It maybe assumed,
as in the hypothesis of Hooks, Huycens, and EvLrx; that an
ethereal matter, susceptible- of electrical affections, fills all
space;-or that the positive and negative electrical 'states,
may increase' the force. of vapour from the  substances'in
which they exist;- and there is a fact in favour. of this last
idea which I have: often witnessed=—when the: voltaic' dis-
charge is made'in the Boylean'vacuum, either from platinum
or" charcoal, incontact with» mercury, the discharging sur-
faces require to be brought very near in the first instance;
but the electricity may be afterwards made to pass to'consi-
derable distances / through the- vapour ' generated from” the
mercury or charcoal by'its agency ;—and when two surfaces
of highly fixed metal, such as platinum or iron are used, the
discharge will pass only: through a very small distance, and
cannot be permanently kept up. The circumstance, that the intensity of the electrical light
in the mercurial vacuum diminishes as it is cooled to a cer-
tain point, when the vapour must be of almost infinitely small
density, and is then stationary, seems strongly opposed to
the idea, that it is owing to any permanent vapour emitted


electrical phenomena exhibited in vacuo.
