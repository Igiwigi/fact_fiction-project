Lastly, there was an apparently
insignificant little specimen from a depth of 1,800 fathoms at Station 158 in the
Southern Sea.* Tt has five simple arms, and appeared at first sight to be merely
a young individual of Eudiocrinus 8emperi,f which was dredged at Stations 164
and 169. Upon closer examination, howeyer, I found that the specimen, although
a true Comatula, and resembling Fudiocrinus in having but five arms, presents two
characters which occur in no other Neocrinoid. Tn fact it is only among some of the
older Palzocrinoids that similar features are to be met with, and I have no hesitation
in saying that this is by far the most remarkable of all the Crinoids obtained by any
of the recent deep-sea exploring expeditions. Under these cireumstances I propose to distinguish the type by the generic name
Thawmatocrinus,f with the specific degignation renovatus.
