careful preservation to the sixth day in a favourable temperature. The spermatozoa
were distinctly visible within the envelopes, without change of position, for several
hours, but no fecundation was effected by them ; no chamber was formed in either
of the eggs, no segmentation took place, nor was any embryo produced. 'Phese
cireumstances seem to Show that the eggs were already dead, as was supposed, before
contact of the spermatozoon ; consequently that the entrance of the spermatozoon
into the envelope is due to a power inherent in the penetrating body, and not simply
to an attraction on the part of the yelk ; although from the fact that the spermatozoa
usually enter in a centripetal direction, it is probable that some influence may be
exerted by the yelk or its vesicle, although penetration is mainly the result of force
in the spermatozoon.

The facts now 8tated of penetration by the spermatozoon seem to Jead us better
to understand the nature of some experiments with solutions of caustic potass, which
are detailed in my former paper. I have repeated these experiments, during the past
season, in the presence of several friends, Professors Saarvey, Eris, and BELL, and
Messrs. Buss, Tours and WargRnovst, with resn]ts precisely similar to: those which

is applied to a set of eggs, andâ€”as s00n afterwards as the experiment can be made,
