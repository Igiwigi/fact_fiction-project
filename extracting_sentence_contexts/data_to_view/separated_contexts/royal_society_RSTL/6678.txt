of the 8UP-
plied Nitrogen were recovered as increased yield. To the statement of these facts it should be added that the Nitrogen (equal in amount
to, 8ay 60 per cent. of that supplied in the manure) which is not obtained as increased
yield in the immediate crop does not appear to exist, in the 80il ayailably for an imme-
diately succeeding crop. Thus, when by the use of nitrogenous manures an increased
yield of Nitrogen has been obtained in the first sncceeding wheat-crop, equal in amount
to about 40 per cent.
