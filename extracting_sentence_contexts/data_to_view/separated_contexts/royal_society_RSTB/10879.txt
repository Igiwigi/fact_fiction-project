First, many studies apply basic regression analyses [72], with
all of the problems that this entails, such as confounding
genetic and environmental effects. Using twin studies, as
often undertaken in humans (table 1) does not fully resolve
this problem (see section 7). Secondly, despite the fact that tel-
omeres change with age (see section 4) studies normally
sample parents and offspring at different ages (i.e. as adults
and juveniles, respectively), especially in long-lived organisms. Many human studies have attempted to statistically control for
parent/offspring age, by including age as a covariate or cor-
recting telomere length for age (but this does not allow for
the expected nonlinear relationship), and very few also control
for parental age at conception (but see [31,47,54,60,61]). In
other species, age has also rarely been fully controlled for
(table 1).
