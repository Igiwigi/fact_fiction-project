the square of the velocity of sliding.

Conceive, further, that each particle of the liquid has that pressure applied to it
which is required in order to keep its motion sensibly the same as if there were no
friction ; the solid body must of course be urged forwards by a pressure equal and oppo-
8ite to the resultant of all the before-mentioned pressures.

The action, amongst the liquid particles, of pressures sufficient to overcome the fric-
tion, will disturb to a certain extent the motions of the liquid particles, and the figures
Q of the surfaces of uniform pressure ; but it will be assumed that those disturbances are
D small enough to be neglected, for the purposes of the present inquiry. The smallness
E of the pressures producing such disturbances, and consequently the 8mallness of those
= disturbances themselves, may be inferred from the fact, that the friction of a current
S of water over a surface of painted iron of a given area is equal to the weight of a layer
&0 of water covering the same area, and of a thickness which is only about 0036 of the
Sh height due to the velocity of the current.
= Those conditions having been assumed, let it now be proposed, to find approximately
D the amount of resultant pressure required to overcome the friction between the wave and
S the wave-s8haped 80lid.

-2 This problem is to be solved by finding the mechanical work expended in overcoming
Â© friction in an indefinitely small time df, and dividing that work by the distance through
= which the solid moves in that time. ,
