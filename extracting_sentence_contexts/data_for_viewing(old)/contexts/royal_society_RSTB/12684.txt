indicate the chromosome, the coordinates and the name of the new insertion. The coordinates are the start and end positions of the sequence that has been
duplicated upon insertion as detected by our program. The true position of the insertion is one of them, depending of the orientation of the TE. For Tos77
and Lullaby insertions, the positions highlighted in bold have been determined by sequencing. A circle (green for Tos77, red for Lullaby, blue for Karma) indicate
the presence of the insertion in each plant.
