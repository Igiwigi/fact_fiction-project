tube of same internal diameter without such “ridge ” (compare Photographs Nos. 20
and 26). Hence it is highly improbable that the “ spin ” causing the sinuous character
of the flame front, and the banded appearance of the detonation flame behind it, can
be due to a helical rotation of the gaseous medium as a whole.

(11) Any supposition that the “spin” is primarily due to some stationary wave
system set up in the gaseous medium as the result of vibrations (due to distortions) along
the explosion tube itself seemed disposed of when it was found that the insertion of a
2-5 cms. plasticine junction between two successive glass sections of the explosion tube
had no effect whatsoever upon either the frequency or intensity of the phenomenon
observed in a moist 200 + O, detonation (vide Photograph No. 27).

Taking the foregoing facts and circumstances as a whole, as constituting substantially
the principal experimental evidence so far available, they seem to be consistent with
Professor Levy’s third suggestion (c), namely, that the observed “ spin” in detonation
is due, not to the medium rotating as a whole, but to the “ head” of detonation travelling
spiral-wise as a wave-front through the medium in the tube at the observed flame
speed, the banded appearance of the “ tail ” being ascribable to periodic waves along
itself.
