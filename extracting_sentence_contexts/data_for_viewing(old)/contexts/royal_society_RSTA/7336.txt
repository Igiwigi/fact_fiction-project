presence of other ionizing particles. Boron disintegrated by pure thermal neutrons would
be expected to have an extremely small ionic efficiency at low concentrations of solute.

It is clear that, even under conditions in which radicals are predominantly eliminated
by interaction with enzyme, the expansion of the column may be quite limited, and
appreciable concentrations of radicals may only exist in the immediate vicinity of the
track, so that only a small fraction of the enzyme in solution may be exposed to inactiva-
tion. Lea has shown* that if, as appears to be true in the case of carboxypeptidase,
inactivated enzyme has approximately the same efficiency in eliminating radicals as the
unchanged enzyme, then the a-ray ionic yield limited in this way by the self-protection of
the enzyme will be independent of enzyme concentration.

We incline to the view that these conditions do not, in fact, prevail in our a-ray experi-
ments. It appears most probable that the small observed Â«-ray ionic yield is due princi-
pally to d-ray ionization, and that the majority of the labile product has no opportunity
of reacting with enzyme molecules because it is rapidly eliminated within the a-ray
column by alternative reactions.
