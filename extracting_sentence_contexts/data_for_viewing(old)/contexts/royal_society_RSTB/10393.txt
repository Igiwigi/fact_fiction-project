lek for updates Barrett [1] makes three observations relevant to IIT 3.0 as discussed by Tononi &

A reply to Barrett (2016). Phil. Trans. R. Soc. B Firstly, for many systems, ®—as outlined in IIT 3.0—may not be comput-

able as it may never be practical to carry out all possible discrete grainings in
space, time and relevant functional elements and maximize over these. Of
course, as Barrett himself points out, the fact that something may not be com-
putable does not impact the ontological status of the theory (i.e. classical
Accepted: 5 November 2015 thermodynamics that deals with ensembles of the order of 10° particles).
Secondly, even an idealized, abstract feed-forward system that, according
to IIT 3.0, has zero ®, may well have a non-zero @ if built out of real physical
components given reciprocal interactions at the molecular micro-level.
This is a correct observation. The theory as presently formulated [3] deals
with discrete (binary), simulated units implementing transition probability
matrices. It remains to be seen whether the actual numerical value for ® of a
physical instantiation of a feed-forward system is numerically non-negligible.
This would not, however, invalidate IIT 3.0. Even under these circumstances,
it is likely that ® associated with physically instantiated, strongly connected
