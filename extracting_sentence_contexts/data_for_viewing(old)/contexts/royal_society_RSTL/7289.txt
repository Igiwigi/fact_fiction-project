M. Here, in a paper * Sur la theorie de la transformation des fonctions Abeliennes,”
Comptes Rendus, t. xl. (1855), pp. 249, &e., establishes incidentally the properties of
the matrix for the automorphic linear transformation of the bipartite quadric function
aw +yz—2y—wa, or transformation of this function into one of the like form,
XW+YZ—ZY'—WX'. These properties are (as will be shown) deducible from a
general formula in my ** Memoir on the Automorphic Linear Transformation of a Bipar-
tite Quadric Function,” Phil. Trans. vol. cxlviii. (1858), pp. 39-46 ; but the particular
case in question is an extremely interesting one, the theory whereof is worthy of an
independent investigation. For convenience the number of variables is taken to be four ;
but it will be at once seen that as well the demonstrations as the results are in fact
applicable to any even number whatever of variables.

Article Nos. 1 & 2.—Notation and Remarks.

1. Tuse throughout the notation and formulte contained in my © Memoir on the Theory
of Matrices,” Phil. Trans. vol. cxlviii. (1858), pp. 17-37, and in the above-mentioned
memoir on the Automorphic Transformation. With respect to the composition of
matrices, the rule of composition is as follows, viz., any tine of the compound matrix is
obtained by combining the corresponding ine of the first or further component matrix
with the several columns of the second or nearer component matrix ; it is very convenient

to indicate this by the algorithm,
