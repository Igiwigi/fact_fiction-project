ventral surface of R. aurantiaca (Plate 54, fig. 2) and of Iron sp. (Plate 55, fig. 2) clearly
indicates in which of the two the dise is better formed on the ventral surface. In
Rhithrogena the lamelle are narrower, so that they overlap one another at their distal
ends only and are not provided with any spinous pads on their ventral aspect, which
is perfectly smooth. The fibrils of the abdominal tracheal branchie are more extensive
in Rhithrogena than in Tron, and this fact indicates that the former inhabit less
oxygenated waters than those in which the latter are found.* Moreover, as is dis-
cussed further, the presence of three caudal sete in Rhithrogena is an indication that
these insects live in gentler currents; the general facies of the animal also points
to the same conclusion.

There is no doubt that in the family Heptageniide evolution had proceeded along
adaptive lines, but hitherto the significance, the causes, and direction of such a course
have not been properly understood. Having discussed the chief characters of the various
genera in relation to environment, it is now possible to correlate them with the flow of
water, the chief factor in the environment. The development and the consequent
modifications of the gill lamell have alreadyjbeen pointed out. The caudal sete under
normal conditions help the animal in progression and act like the tail fin of a fish.
