He observes that such vibrations involve no condensation ;
and as in a plane wave all the points in the medium move in parallel directions, the
effective strain produced in it may be taken to be specified by the rotation of the
element, which is round a line in the plane of the wave-front and at right angles to
the line of the displacement, this rotation being proportional to the rate of change 0!
the displacement in the direction of propagation. Having previously shown, probably
for the first time, that the expression now interpreted as representing the elementary
rotation in the displacement of a medium by strain, enjoys the invariant properties
of a vector, he at once seizes upon it as the very thing he wants, as it has a meaning
independent of any particular system of axes to which the motion is referred; an
he makes the potential energy of the medium a quadratic function of the components
of this elementary rotation. As pointed out by Sroxest, the possible forms of th
effective strain and therefore of the energy-function are by no means thus restricted :
in fact Green had a short time previously established another form, in which th
