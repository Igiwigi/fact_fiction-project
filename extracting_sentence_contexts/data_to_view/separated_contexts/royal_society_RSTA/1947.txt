This Oseen tensor [35] or stokeslet [3] forms the basis for slender body theory [3,4], along with the
boundary integral method [36-38]. The boundary integral method enables the flow exterior to or
bounded by a smooth surface B to be expressed as

1
u(y) = = [], Seceavientss + 5 [Trea formes, 27)

where f is the traction, i.e. the force per unit area exerted by the fluid on the surface, n is the
unit normal pointing into the fluid, and Tixe is the stress tensor —P,dj¢ + W(deSjx + djSex)- The
summation convention over repeated Cartesian indices is assumed above and throughout. For problems satisfying [fu -ndSy =0, i.e. no change in volume, the second integral term
(‘double layer potential’) in equation (2.7) can be eliminated (see for example [39]), motivating
focus on the single layer boundary integral equation

Using the fact that Six(x, y) = Sxj(y, x) and relabelling, equation (2.8) may be rewritten [38]

uj(x) =— in : Si(x, yfcly) dSy. (2.9)

The well-known advantages of the boundary integral are (1) reducing the computational
domain from a three-dimensional (3D) volume to a two-dimensional surface (or possibly one-
dimensional line) B, and (2) the natural treatment of open boundaries without the need to make
artificial truncations, enabling excellent computational accuracy and efficiency. For example,
Phan-Thien et al. were able to model propulsion of a physiologically shaped bull sperm cell in
the mid-1980s, making use of machines with the order of 1 MB memory [37]. The standard numerical approach to the solution of equation (2.9) is to discretize the traction as

where f[1],...,f[N] are vector constants and ¢)(y),..., @n(y) are basis functions (see figure 1 for
a sketch of the discretization over a rigid sphere).
