except at the ends, and his solution is sufficient to satisfy all conditions. Obviously
vertical pressures and tensions across the faces y = + 6 must introduce important
stresses WY so that that part of pr Sarmr-VENANT’s hypothesis, in the generalised
problem, must go, Still it appears reasonable to suppose, on the whole, that, even
for a beam where c¢ and b are of the same order, we may, as a first approximation,
retain the hypothesis z=0. OF course, eventually, as ¢ increases a stress 2 must
appear. until when c¢ is very large we reach the limiting case of problem (A) when
this stress is sufficient to ensure the vanishing of the displacement w.

If, however, ¢ be not too large, so that we can suppose ue sensibly zero throughout,

* September 13, 1902. I have, since writing the above, verified that a solution for rectangular beams
does exist, which fulfils rigidly these conditions. It is, in fact, identical with part of CLEBscn’s solution
for a thick plate.

then the mean values U, V taken across the breadth of the beam of the displace-
ments w, v in the plane zy are found to satisfy two differential equations of the same
form as the equations of elasticity when the displacements are independent of z
and w= 0, with this change, that the elastic constant is replaced by another
constant ’. The mean stresses in the plane of xy are found by differentiation from
