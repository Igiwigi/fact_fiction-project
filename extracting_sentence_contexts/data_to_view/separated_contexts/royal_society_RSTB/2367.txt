This is well shown both for
Hymenophyllum and Trichomanes in the drawings of Presi, and in the Genera
Filicum (Plates 31 and 32). The sporangia are, like those of Cyatheze, produced in
basipetal succession upon the more or less elongated receptacle. This fact was noted

The development in Hymenophyllum was also described by him in the text of his
paper, and I now add a drawing of the young sorus of Hymenophyllum Wilsoni
(fig. 94), which shows the young sporangia near the apex of the receptacle, while
below there are clear indications of the active intercalary growth; this drawing may
be compared with fig. 11 of Gleichenia. The extent of the intercalary growth of the
receptacle is greater in T’richomanes than in Hymenophyllum, and the genera were
by early writers distinguished on this ground, those with the receptacle exserted
being ranked with the former, while those with it included fell into Hymenophyllum.
