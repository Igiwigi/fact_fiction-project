The advantage of this approach is that
higher regularity norms of the velocity field are controlled uniformly in time, and that the growth
of the Sobolev norm holds for every (non-trivial) advected scalar with initial data in H!. We will
therefore be able to keep under control higher W"? norms of the vector field uniformly in time,
and to show loss of H! regularity for every such initial data. In fact, since the construction is local,
we need only assume that the initial data is locally in HRâ€™). The iterative construction becomes however less explicit, since the location and the spatial
scale of the family of cubes depend on the initial data, as we need to select the cubes in such a
way that the derivative of the initial data is large enough in all of the cubes. Proof of theorem 1.1.
