Conclusion

It is probably fair to say that in the last 10 years, ICA has become a standard tool in machine
learning and signal processing. The generality and potential usefulness of the model were never
in question, but in the early days of ICA, there was some doubt about the adequacy of the
assumptions of non-Gaussianity and independence. It has been realized that non-Gaussianity
is in fact quite widespread in any applications dealing with scientific measurement devices (as
opposed to, for example, data in the social and human sciences). On the other hand, independence
is now being seen as a useful approximation that is hardly ever strictly true. Fortunately, it does
not need to be strictly true because most ICA methods are relatively robust regarding some
dependence of the components.
