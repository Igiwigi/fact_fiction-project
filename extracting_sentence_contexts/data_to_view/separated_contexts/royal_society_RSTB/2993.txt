It can take place quite indepen-
dently of coition, the Bitch in this respect differing from the Rabbit (Hare, 1897),
and the Ferret (MarsHALt, 1904), which in certain cases, at least, fail to ovulate in
the absence of the male, but agreeing with the Mare (Harr, 1897), the Sheep under
normal circumstances, the Mouse (Soporra, 1895), and probably the majority of
mammals.} But owing to the abbreviation and less pronounced characteristics of the
procestrum and cestrus in the Sheep and other animals, it is not easy to make certain
in which of these two periods ovulation normally takes place. This difficulty is
alluded to in the memoir on the cestrous cycle in the Sheep (MArsHALL, 1903).{ But
since in the Bitch ovulation takes place during cestrus, and in the Rabbit and Ferret it
may only be induced after the additional stimulus of coition, and therefore not until
after the commencement of cestrus, it is highly probable that the latter period is the
usual time for its occurrence in the Sheep, the Mare and the majority of mammals
which ovulate in the absence of the male. It follows that such animals can become
pregnant as a consequence of the artificial introduction of spermatozoa into the

* This fact has been already published in Mr. SepGWIcK’s text-book on the “ Vertebrata,” which
appeared last March. The information was communicated to him privately, but by inadvertence he
omitted to direct attention to this. (See Mr.
