The present rotation of the earth can similarly be represented by a term — f’P’,,
where 6’ <8. The equation to the present surface of the sea may accordingly be
taken to be

r=d,— BP’,

and hence the height above the present sea-level of the surface of the primeval
rotating pear, if restored, would be

(9 = @y) + &P, + a;Py — (8 — B’) P's,

Tt will be found that the effect of the rotational term (8 — £’) P’, is to move the
theoretically predicted Australia nearer to the equator of the earth, and to change its
shape from a spherical cap to a sphero-conic. |

Again, we should expect the highest land to be on the axis of harmonies, and,
therefore, in or near England. Here, again, the agreement of facts with theory
might be closer if we could suppose the continent, which geology shows to have
existed at one time in mid-Atlantic, to be restored to its former position, But the
agreement of facts with theory can only be expected to be of the roughest kind, and
we must always bear in mind that our theory does not lead us to expect that the
present figure of the earth will be pear-shaped, but only that it will resemble a pear
disfigured by a long series of ruptures.
