Second Approximation.*—To obtain a more accurate solution we use cosine approxi-
mations for I and I’ in determining J, instead of mean values. Assume for this purpose

= a+2b cos 0, ’ = a—2b cos w.
We then find (omitting the details),
b = 2F, Sie Hh (D-Eee) ee | Gel ence: . > (27')
using as the boundary condition the fact that the ¢otal incident radiation is zero. Hence

I (c, 6) = $F (1+ $04 $ cos 6)+e7 (%~” * [T, —3F (1+30,4+ $008 6)],. . (28’)

The net flux condition at the inner boundary gives
