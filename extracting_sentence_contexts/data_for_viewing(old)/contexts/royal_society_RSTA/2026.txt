Next, we attempt to use only the uncompensated, raw voltage-clamp measurements (i.e. only Iout
in figure 5a, and Vmq) to infer the underlying membrane voltage, Vm, and the parameters of the
model cells. We then compare the model Vm predictions with the current-clamp measurements.
Here our focus is on the Type II Model Cell, since this should be the more challenging of the
two and more similar to a real ionic current (similar results for the Type I Model Cell are
in the electronic supplementary material, §S5). To optimize the model parameters root-mean-
squared error (RMSE) between the simulated and recorded Iout was minimized using a global

Type Il cell and improves on the amplifier's estimates of the components.
