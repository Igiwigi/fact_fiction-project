The yellow colour of fresh hees'-wax and of palm-oil, are also, I doubt not, referable
to the same, or a nearly similar colouring matter, both being very speedily bleached
by exposure to light.

193. Viola odorata,â€”Chemists are familiar with the colour of this flower as a test of
acids and alkalies, for which, however, it seems by no means better adapted than many
others ; less 80, indeed, than that of the Yiola tricolor, the common purple Iris, and
many others which might be named. It offers, in fact, another, and rather a striking
instance of the simultaneous existence of two colouring ingredients in the same
flower, comporting theimselves differently, not only in regard to light but to chemical
agents. Extracted with alcohol, the juice of the violet is of a rich blue colour, which
it imparts in high perfection to paper. Exposed to sunshine, a portion of this colour
gives way pretty readily, but a residual blue, rather inclining to greenish, resists obs-
tinately, and requires a very much longer exposure (for whole weeks indeed) for its
destruction, which is not even then complete.
