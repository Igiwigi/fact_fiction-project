the hemo-chorial type, throws but little light on the much-discussed question of the
affinities of Hyrax. This mammal has been variously described as related to the
Rodentia, the Ungulates and Elephas. The placentation certainly bears no resemblance
to any Ungulate so far investigated, and although it agrees with that of rodents in
being heemo-chorial it is sharply distinguishable by its zonary form and the detailed
character of its trophoblast. At first sight there would appear to be some resemblance
to the full-term placenta of Elephas, as described by AssHeTon and STEVENS (1905).
There is the same zonary arrangement and a comparable great complexity in the
arrangement of the allantoic villi, but in Hyrax there is no syncytial layer of maternal
tissue such as is said to surround the villi in the elephant. Were the placentation of
Elephas better known, however, it is possible that resemblances might be found, but as
far as our knowledge extends at present, it is not possible to make any definite statement.
In fact, the placenta of Hyrax, whilst conforming to the hemo-chorial type typical of
the Rodentia, Insectivora, etc., is of so unusual a type, and presents such unique
features of its own, that all one is justified in saying is that our present knowledge of
the placentation of Hyrax rather tends to emphasise the isolated position which the
order occupies in the series of the Eutheria.
