It is known that if the set of moment coefficients satisfy certain conditions, the
corresponding frequency distribution is completely defined.* Such, for instance, is the
case when the series ¥{u,(7t)*/k!} is convergent, and it then represents the character-
istic function of the distribution.

We do not, however, propose to go more closely into this question, and shall
consider only the cases in which the moments coefficients of ¢ satisfy the conditions
of H. Hampurcert. In these cases, to which the theory developed below only
appliest, it follows from (87) that when ¢, which is related to pp (a, , ... 2) by

+ We are indebted to Dr. R. A. Fisher for kindly calling our attention to the fact that we had
originally omitted to refer to this restriction.

} It may easily be proved that these conditions are satisfied in the case of Examples (7), (8), (9), (10)
