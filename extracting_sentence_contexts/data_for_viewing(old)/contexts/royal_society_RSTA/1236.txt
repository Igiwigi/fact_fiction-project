in the space X := C9(0, 00) of continuous functions on (0, 00) which vanish at both 0 and 00, shows
that these results, as close as they seem to be to asserting convergence of semigroups, cannot
be much improved. In this example, the resolvents converge to zero, but the semigroups do not
except atx =0.

It turns out that, in the general case, the subspace, say Xo, of x € X such that limy— 90 Tn(t)x
exists and is uniform for t in compact subsets of Rt can be characterized by means of the limit
pseudo-resolvent Rj, > 0 and/or the extended limit operator A:

Xo = RangeRy = D@), (4.1)

where the bar denotes the closure; in Xo, the formula T(#)x = limy—oo Tn(t)x defines a limit
semigroup. This is a reflection of the fact that each Hille-Yosida operator ‘produces’ also a
semigroup, but this semigroup is defined only on the subspace equal to the closure of this
operator’s domain. In the case of .A, this is the subspace of those sequences which converge to
a member of Xo.

5. Singular perturbations; Kurtz's Theorem

In this section, for the sake of applications we will present in §6, we come back to the notations of
§2: the operators A; are generators of semigroups satisfying the stability condition (2.1).

We have established that if (c) in the convergence theorem fails to hold (but the remaining two
are satisfied), the limit lim,_,1— T;(#)x exists and is uniform for f in compact subsets of R* only for
x in the subspace Xq of the original Banach space. Outside of Xo, the limit usually does not exist.
