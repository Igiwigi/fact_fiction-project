lower down.

In the second place, the © forces of figure” which cause the resolution of a liquid
cylinder at rest, cannot be considered as solely operative in bringing about the changes
which take place in a jet vibrating under the influence of sounds lower in pitch than
its normal, Experience shows that whatever may be the rate of the impressed vibra-
tions, within the prescribed limits, and however complex their character, all produce
disturbances which grow equally along the jet. As I understand PLaTEav's theory,
developed by Lord RAyLEIGH, this would not be the case with disturbances growing
under the influence of surface tension alone. The forces of figure, then, either must
act in some definite way in both cases; or, if in the latter, they are entirely subordinate
to, and controlled by, the impressed forces, some further condition than the mere form
of the jet must be taken into account to explain the difference. In fact, their ole
action seems to be that they fix an upper and ill-defined limit to the rate of vibration
of the jet. With all vibrations below this limit they do not in any way interfere.

The conclusion to be drawn is rather that a jet, ab least in its upper part, is not
comparable to a liquid cylinder at rest. T shall show reason for believing that it
may become 80 at a distance from the orifice ; and also that the resemblance may be
more pronounced in large jets than in small ones.

It is at once obvious thab PLaTeav's theory is quite inapplicable to gaseous
Jets,? the phenomena of which are strictly parallel to those of liquid jets, and
identical with those of a liquid jet playing within a mass of similar liquid, in which the
* forces of figure” are necessarily entirely abolished. An examination of some instan-
