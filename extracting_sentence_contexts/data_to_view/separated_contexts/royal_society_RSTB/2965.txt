Others are similarly striped with yellow or green. The coloration of “ barred” forms is due to a disposition of chromatophores similar
to that which gave rise to this colour-form in adult Hippolyte.

“Monochrome forms” are again due to the same arrangement which we have
described in the adult. Thus the first adolescent patterns are identical with those ot the adult patterns,
and underneath each of them the constant primary system can be discovered ; in
fact, the faint brown-lined colour-form is to all intents and purposes merely the larval
pattern writ large. But for one class of evidence, the conclusion would seem to be
that in these adolescent colour-forms we have the chief varieties of adult Hippolyte. This evidence concerns the second adolescent patterns.
