convolutions is complete. This stage is shown in fig. 13, Plate 16, and fig. 32, Plate 17,
the previous figures (figs. 11, 30; 12, 31) can then be described as early and late
preleptotene.* At leptotene, ‘‘chromomeres” are visible in sectioned material (fig. 32)
and free liquid has begun to appear in the nuclear area. It is an open question how
much the gross morphology of the nucleus is an artefact at this and the succeeding
stages. The ‘“‘synaptic knot” of the older writers has often been waived aside as
“artificial shrinkage”, although the observations of Ethel Sargant (1897) on the
living cells of Lilium still seem to be valid evidence to the contrary.t Be that as it
may, two observations on the condition in Osmunda cannot be illusory. One is the
very considerable increase in the total volume of nuclear sap, which began at late
preleptotene (fig. 12) and continues until zygotene (fig. 14), as was accurately
described by Lawson (1911). The other is that at leptotene, unlike preleptotene,
mutual displacement of parts of chromosomes certainly occurs. The fact that the
chromosomes not only open out their loops but slip over one another in doing so is
clearly reflected in the behaviour of the nucleoli. These tend to be pushed out of
place; they often come in contact with each other and coalesce, so that whereas at

* The need for separating leptotene from preleptotene for descriptive purposes was also felt by

Janssens (1924).

+ Itis doubtful whether the situation regarding this much-debated appearance is materially different
now from what it was in 1910 when Grégoire made a very just and able résumé of the evidence. His
view was that the contraction is certainly often enhanced by reagents and may sometimes, especially
in animals, be absent. In other cases he was satisfied that it was not entirely artificial for it could be
