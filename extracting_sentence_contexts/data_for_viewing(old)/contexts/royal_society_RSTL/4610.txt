At present two opinions exist regarding the evolution of the ear-bulb. It is stated
by Bazs that it arises s0on after the appearance of the eye, in the form of a tubular
prolongation of the brain, which is hollow, and communicates with the cavity of the
fourth ventricle, its peripheral extremity forming a vesicular dilatation, which is
gradually separated from the brain. Into this vesicle, which is the analogue of the
labyrinth, there is protruded inwards a reflection of the integument, which forms
all the accessory parts of the organ of hearing. Huscnke's account is entirely dif-
ferent ; he says that the membranous labyrinth does not arise from the brain, but is
originally a blind sac of the skin with an excretory duct, which gradually contract-
ing, is at last separated from the common integument and exists as a separate 8ac
beneath it. The following observations coincide partly with the description given by
Barn; at the same time I shall venture to state some facts in connection with this
point that have not been (as far as I am acquainted) previously noticed. In the
embryo chick at the fiftieth hour, s0on after the close of the second day, I observed
that the medulla oblongata was not closed in above, but presented a large open
shallow cavity, the analogue of the fourth ventricle. At the cephalic extremity it
communicated with the optic lobes and the anterior cerebral cell by means of a small
circular orifice, From the central part of the wall of this cavity, and exactly oppo-
Site to the second branchial cleft, the first rudiment of the auditory sac was visible,
in the form of a small protruded vesicle of a s0mewhat flattened circular sbape ; this
vesicle was hollow, clear and pellucid, and communicated with the ventricular cavity
by a small circular orifice. This communication was most distinctly seen on exami-
ning the embryo from the dorsal aspect, as shown in fig. 13, where the aperture
leading into the protruded sac is visible on one side, bounded by its well-defined
