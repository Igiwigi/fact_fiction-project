The following solution is obtained by a symbolical method, which leaves something
to be desired from the point of view of rigour. But there is no actual doubt regarding
the final result. The direct form of the integral equation for Q(x), which does not use
the fact that ¢ (x) satisfies the homogeneous equation, is
