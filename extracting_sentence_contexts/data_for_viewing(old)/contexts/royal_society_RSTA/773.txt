The frugal innovation approach, however, also differs from the economics notion of
efficiency in several ways. First, it considers time also as an input. The economics definition
does not factor in time. Second, unlike the economist’s approach which considers consumer
preferences as a given, the frugal innovation approach recognizes that consumer preferences
are somewhat pliable and can be influenced by a firm’s actions (such as prices, promotion,
advertising, etc.).

There are also some important methodological differences between the three approaches. The
economics approach is deductive and top-down in nature. The economist makes some (often
heroic) assumptions about the nature of firms and consumers and then deduces how resources are
allocated in the economy. Thus, while attempting to be descriptive and predictive, the approach
is really normative in nature. It in fact outlines how the world should be ideally (if all the
assumptions were fulfilled). The engineering approach, by contrast, is less utopian (as it does
not make as many heroic assumptions), but is nevertheless normative as it is concerned with
what firms ought to do, not what they actually do.

By contrast, frugal innovation is a descriptive notion based on and drawn from the actual
practices of firms. Specifically, it relies on empirically grounded, bottom-up induction and


attempts to describe how firms that are so inclined might attempt to generate more value in
terms of outputs using fewer resources (inputs). It recognizes that firms’ actual practices are
messy and suboptimal in essence. However, it also leaves room for firms to aspire towards and
achieve more optimal (or less suboptimal) outcomes. Further, there is the implication of how this
