Ahese porous beds.” In his fifteenth letter upon glaciers, and in reference to some
Zhteresting observations of Mr. MiLwan's, he endeavoured to account for the difference
Sf structure by referring it to an annual *gush” of the ice, which is produced by the
Ylfference of action in 8summer and winter, We are ignorant of the nature of the
Experiments on which this theory of the dirt-bands is founded, and would offer the fol-

owing simple explanation of those which came under our own observation.
6 Standing at a point which commanded a view of the Rhone glacier, both above and
Selow the cascade, we observed that the extensive ice-field above was discoloured
Sy sand and debris, distributed without regularity. At the summit of the ice-fall the
Bralley narrows to a gorge, and the slope downwards is for some distance precipitous.

In descending, the ice is greatly shattered ; in fact, the glacier is broken repeatedly

at the swmmit of the declivity, transverse chasms being thus formed ; and these.
as the ice descends, are broken up into confused ridges and peaks, with intervening
spaces, where the mass is ground to pieces. By this breaking up of the glacier the
dirt upon its surface undergoes fresh distribution : instead of being spread uniformly
over the lope, spaces are observed quite free from dirt, and other spaces covered with
it, but there is no appearance of regularity in this distribution. At some places large
* *I cannot help thinking that they are the true annual rings of the glacier, which mark its age like

thoge of a tree.” —Appendix to Travels, p. 408.
