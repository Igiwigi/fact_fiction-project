A difficulty of this sort is discussed by
Eppreron,t who seems to argue that Kramers’ theory includes the stimulated emission
since in the absence of incident radiation the electron could not maintain the assumed
orbit. The quantum theory, however, does not support this argument. In fact, it

appears from (5.39) that the correct absorption coefficient gives a more violent divergence
than Kramers’. It is doubtful, however, whether this large absorption at low fre-
quencies has much importance.
