To-day, however, our fuller information
on locusts presents a superficially confused picture similar to that Fraenkel then described
for butterflies. Yet, while recognizing the lack of any fixed relation between migrant
butterfly directions and wind directions, Fraenkel insisted that this did not exclude the
possibility of causal role for the wind in many of the cases when with- or against-wind
migration was reported, and he discussed means by which flying insects might orient
actively on the wind (see below). Waloff (1946) ) and Rainey & Waloff (1948), on the other hand, chose for analysis some
rapid, long-distance swarm movements made when ‘the wind speed is greater than the air
speed of the locusts’ so that the ‘down-wind displacement would in fact occur even in the
complete absence of any persistent orientation’, and when the locusts were crossing the sea
and so presumed to be obliged to remain air-borne. This approach undoubtedly simplifies
the situation, thereby enabling the meteorological aspects of a certain type of resultant
displacement to be worked out, but it should not lead us away from the biological aspects
of migration. Williams (1930, 1942, 1949) and de Lépiney (1928, 1933) do not merely leave on one side the
orienting influence of the wind; they make out a case against it, except at the moment of
taking off.
