198 PROFESSOR W. C. WILLIAMSON ON THE ORGANIZATION

That the Sigillarie were Lepidodendroid is a conclusion that has been already arrived
at, first by Dr. Hooker and afterwards by Mr. BINNEY and Mr. CARRUTHERS ; but the
facts upon which this conclusion was based by these writers appear to me insufficient to
furnish a demonstration of this affinity, since no example of a true Sigillarig in which
the internal structure is preserved appears to have been hitherto described. Mr. Bixxgy
has described some plants* which he believes to be true Sagillarie ; but I agree with
Mr. CarrvTHERs, who has pointed out that one of thesef is a true Lepidodendron. Another, is a very curious and distinct plant of which I haye sections, but which I
have, as yet, failed to interpret ; whilst the remaining plates refer to a plant which L
$hall notice further in this memoir, and which may be a Sigillaria; but I fear that we
have not as yet, sufficient evidence to render justifiable the conclusion that it is 80.
