This
Bousstncautr calculated would correspond to 11,310 kilog. nitrogen per hectare
(= 10,098 Ibs. per acre), one-third of a metre deep. He also determined the
amounts of ammonia, nitric acid, and carbon, in the soil; and he concluded that
the nitrogen, beyond the small amount existing as ammonia or nitric acid, was in
combination as organic matter. In fact it existed in organic detritus, and especially
in a black substance which he observed by the microscope. Referring to the figures, it is seen that in the experiment in 1858 there was a gain
of 00714 gram nitrogen, upon a total of 0°3597 supplied in soil and seed. Further,
calculation shows that, of the total gain 0°0672 gram was in the soil, and only
0:0042 gram in the plant, notwithstanding that the original soil contained 0°3393 gram
nitrogen.
