In conclusion, I would venture a few
remarks on the yalue and judicious use of this material, in its adaptation to ship-
building, and other purposes to which it may be snccessfully applied. It is not my
intention to enter into the question as to whether wood or iron be the preferable
material, as a number of ceircumstances, snch as cost, durahility, &c., must be con-
Sidered in order to form a correct decision. I would however obsecrve, that in ship-building alone, it appears from the facts
already recorded, that iron is very superior in its powers of resistance to strain ; it is
highly ductile in its character, and easily moulded into any required form without
impairing its strength. It is also stronger in combination than timber, arising from
the nature of the construction, and the materials composing the iron ship become
a homogeneous mass when united together, forming as it were a s0lid, without
Joints, and presenting as a whole the most formidable powers of resistance*. These
are some of the properties which appear to distinguish iron from other materials, and
which give it an ascendency of combined action, which cannot be obtained in the
union of timber however ingeniously contrived.
