Under these conditions it was
found that the hydrogen stream carried through the capillary just enough vapour
from W to give a spectrum of fairly high intensity and excellent definition. When
a higher sulphur pressure was required, the well was gently warmed. The long neck
at A, together with the fact that the stream of gas carried the sulphur vapour away
from the window, prevented serious fouling of the latter ; an hourly touch with a small
pointed flame sufficed to keep it clear. The hydrogen pressure in the tube was maintained at about 1 mm. by continued
exhaustion at B, the supply from the reservoir of the voltameter (which was at

approximately atmospheric pressure) being regulated by means of a fine capillary. The
discharge was produced by an induction coil capable of a 5-inch spark between points in
air at atmospheric pressure, fed from 20-volt D.C. mains through a mercury interrupter.
