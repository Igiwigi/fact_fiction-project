Taken together, these findings corroborate suggestions
[5,16,17,33] that education is such a powerful cross-cultural

predictor of fertility decline because it operates through mul-
tiple pathways. It also has effects at multiple levels of analysis
[6]. While not every pathway may be important in every eco-
logical context, more than one pathway is likely to matter in
most cultures, leading to strong cross-cultural effects of
women’s education on fertility, despite variation in local cir-
cumstances. More broadly, these results reinforce the idea
that the demographic transition is both a global and a local
phenomenon—with a number of potential causal pathways
that may act across many societies, despite the fact that
only some of them may be active in any particular society.
Finally, our results suggest that a combination of both econ-
omic and cultural transmission models are needed to
explain fertility decline.
