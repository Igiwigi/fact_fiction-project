and also probably the oxide of silver itself is capable of decomposing the peroxide by
that continuous form of action which is spoken of as Catalytic. This interferes with
the result; the amount of oxygen eyolyed depends upon the relative velocity with which
these two forms of decompoxition occur; and while the reduction in equal atomic pro-
portions is neyer exceeded, and by certain modifications of the experiment may be very
closely approximated to, it, yet is never absolutely realized, for the catalytic action
cannot be entirely eliminated. So that the total loss of oxygen from the oxide of silyer
in the experiment represents the relation which 8ubsists between these two forms of
decompoxition, simultaneously occurring, and varies between the limits of the infinite,
or catalytic action on the one hand, and the reduction in atomic proportions on the
other.

That this is the true account of the phenomena is 8een from the fact that, where these
disturbing causes do not exist, the decompoxition takes place in simple atomic propor-
tions. This was shown to be the case in the decompoxition of the peroxide of barium
by iodine in the presence of water. The final result of this action is expressed by the
equation

I, + Ba, O, = 2Bal -+ O,.
Tt may be considered as taking place by the decomposition and re-formation of water,
according to the two equations,

I, + Ba, O, + H,O = 2HI +Ba,O + O,,
2HI + Bay O = 2Bal + H, O.
