Vincent), and of which the people in these islands, as well as in the
ships, heard about a thousand or twelve hundred distinct blows or reports, and supposed it to be the
noise of guns.

“ As soon as it was understood by the inhabitants in the other islands what it was, that is to say, that it
was an eruption of the earth at the island of St. Vincent or thereabouts, sloops, barks, and other small
vessels came from all parts to see how it was, to enquire into the damage suffered, and to get an account
of the particulars; but how astonished must these enquirers be, when meeting from all parts upon the
same errand, they may be supposed to go cruising about to find the island ; some examining up their
books to cast up the length they had sailed, some blaming their own negligence for not keeping a right
reckoning, some their men for mistaking their distance, others taking observations to know the latitude
they were in ; at last all concluding, as it really was, to their great confusion, that the said island was no
more, that there appeared no remains except three little rocks, no, not any tokens that such an island
had been there, but that, on the contrary, in the place of it the sea was excessive deep, and no bottom to
found at 200 fathoms.

“As this is an event so wonderful as no history can give us an account of the like, so it cannot be
unpleasant to our readers to consider briefly some natural causes which may be assigned for it.”

The writer then proceeds to discuss the possible theoretical explanations of this
remarkable phenomenon. He rejects the suggestion that it was due to an earthquake,
owing to the fact that the island was blown into the air. Two other causes are
considered, the sudden admission of air through eracks produced by earthquakes to
vast bodies of sulphurous and nitrous gases in the caverns and hollows of the earth,
producing a violent explosion, and the ingress of water through fissures to the
subterranean fires. He is rather inclined to adopt the latter hypothesis.
