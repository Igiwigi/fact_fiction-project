Figure 2. Fitted parameter values. (a) Maximum-likelihood point estimates from the basic model of p, and p,, with 95% profile confidence intervals. The left-hand
side of the x-axis represents probabilities closest to 0 (strongest immune barriers). (b) The mixture model returned a fitted distribution of p, values, instead of a
single point estimate.
