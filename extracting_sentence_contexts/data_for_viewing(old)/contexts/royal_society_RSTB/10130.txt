necklaces constructed from modified human skeletal remains
and pierced shell beads [42]. More dramatically, the more-diffi-
cult-to-manufacture tools include woven baskets, bark canoes
and waterproof shelters (figure 3). That the Tasmanians made
objects like these at the time of contact with Europeans under-
cuts the argument that they stopped making bone tools
because they were too complex. Following the logic of Henrich’s
model, if the population was large enough to preserve the
knowledge required to make complex objects like canoes, it
must have been big enough to preserve the knowledge required
to make simpler items like bone points. The corollary of this is
that the impact of reduced population size on skill cannot
explain the fact that Tasmanians stopped making bone points.
An obvious alternative explanation is that environmental con-
ditions changed in such a way that the tasks bone points were
used for were no longer necessary. The production of clothing
has been suggested to be one such task [31,43,44].

In summary, neither Powell et al.’s analysis nor the one
presented by Henrich provides strong support for the popu-
lation size hypothesis. The best that can be said of Powell
et al.’s results is that they provide partial, tentative support
for the hypothesis. The Tasmanian case study discussed by
Henrich does not even provide that level of support.
