These difference curves
should therefore show none of the anomalies present in the experimental curves in the
region of the first absorption band. This result has been only partly achieved by means
of this analysis, for the resultant curves all contain two conspicuous ‘* humps,” which
must be attributed to an inadequate representation by the above equation of the
partial rotations due to the first absorption band. The cause of this can be traced to
the fact that an absorption equation of the Kwrrener-HeLMnourz type, on the basis of
which the rotation equation was derived, could not be made to represent the absorption
data. * © Acad. Sci., Cracow,’ Bull.
