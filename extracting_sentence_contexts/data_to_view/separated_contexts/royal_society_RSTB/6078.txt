Its relation
to the pars medialis of the ventral nucleus is exactly the same as that of the lateral
nucleus to the pars lateralis. It has clearly arisen from the pars medialis. The
close relation which this nucleus always holds to the trigeminal portion of the
ventral nucleus of the thalamus is emphasized by the fact that some authors have
described it as the end-station for trigeminal fibres. Its fibres pass to the cortex
with those of the pars medialis. The pulvinar bears the same relation to the dorsal nucleus of the lateral geniculate
body as do the other members of this group to their own parent nuclei.
