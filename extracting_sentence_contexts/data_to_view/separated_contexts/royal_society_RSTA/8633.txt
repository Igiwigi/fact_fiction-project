On photographs I.—V. inclusive, we
found m = 3°181, and on photographs VI.—VIIL., m = 3°159. Some of the Helium bands appear on the intermediate photographs, though absent
very close to the cathode, and again at some distance from it. They are, in fact, only
shown on the photographs [V.—VIL., according to the details set forthin Table II. The
wave-lengths are only rough values serving to identify the individual bands, and the
values of d, are obtained as before from the calibration curve of the wedge. We
merely record in the table some of the more conspicuous examples of these bands, as
an illustration of their behaviour.
