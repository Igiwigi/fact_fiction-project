8quare root of a sextic function : generally the number of the p-tuple theta-functions
* Is =47; and the quotients of these, or say all but one of them each divided by the
remaining function, are the Abelian functions of p arguments depending on the
irrational function y defined by the equation F(z, y)=0 of a curve of deficiency p.
If instead of connecting the ratios of the functions with'a plane curve we consider the
functions themselves as coordinates of a point in a (47â€”1)dimensional space, then we
have the single functions as the four coordinates of a point on a quadri-quadric curve
(one-fold locus) in ordinary space ; and the double functions as the sixteen coordinates
of a point on a quadri-quadric two-fold locus in 15-dimensional space, the deficiency
of this two-fold locus being of course =2.

The investigations contained in the First Part of the present Memoir, although for
smplicity of notation exhibited only in regard to the double functions are, in fact,
applicable to the general case of the p-tuple functions ; but in the main the Memoir
relates only to the single and double functions, and the title has been given to it
accordingly. The investigations just referred to extend to the single functions ; and
there is, it 8eems to me, an adyantage in carrying on the two theories simultaneously
up to and inclusive of the establighment of what I call the Product-theorem : this is
4 natural point of separation for the theories of the single and the double functions

respectively. The ulterior developments of the two theories are indeed closely
