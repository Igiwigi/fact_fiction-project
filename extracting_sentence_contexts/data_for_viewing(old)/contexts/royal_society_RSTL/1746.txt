made on a long þrass cylindrical tube (No. 35—38), and on a long copper
cylindrical rod (No. 21) : and that the former, which is 14 inch in diameter,

gave a less value for the factor n than the latter which is little more than
4 tenths of an inch in diameter. Conceiving therefore that I might be enabled
to determine the Jaw by which sach values were governed, I was induced to
try other cylindrical rods, supported in the same manner as the copper one
above mentioned, and of nearly the same length, but much smaller in diameter.
I accordingly procured a brass rod, or wire, only 0-185 inch in diameter: in
fact, it was a piece of the same kind of wire as that which was used with the
solid brass cylinder No. 11, mentioned in the preceding part of this paper, page
410. I also caused one to be made about the same length, still smaller in dia-
meter: but, as brass was not exactly suitable to s8nch purpose, when 80 small,
I procured one of steel, only 0-072 inch in diameter *. The length of the brass
rod was 56:4 inches, it weighed 3106 grains and its specific gravity I found to
be 8:444. The length of the steel rod was also 56-4 inches, its weight (including
a 8mall brass screw attached to the end) was 433 grains, and its specific gra-
vity I found to be 7687. Each of these, when in use, was screwed into the
shank of the knife edge apparatus, which was 1:55 inch long, as already
described in page 409. The results are contained in the following short Table :
where I have continued the numbers of the pendulums from the preceding
Table in page 433, for the sake of a convenient reference : No. 42 being No. 21
