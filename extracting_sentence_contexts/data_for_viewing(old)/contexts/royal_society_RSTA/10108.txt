At intervals of an hour the same process is repeated until we are satisfied that no
further change in the rate corresponding to a given pressure will take place. Two

rates, one above and one below the turning point, are then considered to be sufficient
to enable that point to be calculated.

With viscous solutions, such as 660 grammes of cane sugar, it was necessary to
lengthen the interval of time considerably ; in fact, a constant rate was generally only
attained after the apparatus had been set up for some 5 or 6 hours.

In the earlier experiments, before we realised that the method was susceptible of
greater accuracy, we used somewhat larger increments of pressure. It was found that
there were slight differences in the rate corresponding to a given pressure according
as that pressure had been reached from above or below. A momentâ€™s consideration
will show the cause of this.

It is evident that for any definite pressure, unless it be exactly the turning-point
pressure, the solution near the membrane must be changing in concentration; the
change is brought about by the water which is either squeezed out or sucked into the
solution, This layer of abnormal concentration is prevented from merging rapidly
