The jar was slightly charged and insulated, and the poten-
tials read off from time to time. It was found (1) that even after twenty-four hours the
percentage of loss per hour continued to decrease, (2) that the potential could not be
expressed as a function of the time by two exponential terms. But the latter fact was
more clearly shown by the rate of development of the residual charge after different
periods of discharge, which put it beyond doubt that if the potential is properly expressed
by a series of exponential terms at all, several such terms will be required. The following roughly illustrates how such terms could arise. Glass may be regarded
as a mixture of a variety of different silicates ; each of these may behave differently
under electric force, some rapidly approaching the limiting polarity corresponding
to the force, others more slowly.
