for) brought me from Sumatra the pregnant uterus of the
tapir of that country; and' as in that animal the umbilical
chord is connected with the chorion (there being no pla-
centa), I examined the transparent portion of the chorion
along which the branches of the funis pass, before” they
arrive at the spongy part, and there the nerves are 80 con-
spicuous, that Mr. Bavxr's representation of them of the natu-
ral ze is annexed.

The principal object of the present' Lecture is 'to esta-
blish the fact of nerves existing in the placenta ; and in these
animals in which there is no placenta, in the floculent cho-
rion, which is substituted for it ; and it is a curious fact, that
they $hould be largest in the latter.

This discovery places the placentular circulation in a new
point of view, since, from the known influence of the nerves
on the blood vessels, it is reasonable to believe that, during
life, there are branches of communication” between! those of
the uterus and foetus, although too minute to be explored'in
the dead body. The erection of the penis cannot be produced
after death by injecting the arteries, although when the nerves
are excited the smaller branches give a ready passage to the
blood. Having traced nerves from the foetus to the maternal
portion of the placenta, it will add to the value of this com-
