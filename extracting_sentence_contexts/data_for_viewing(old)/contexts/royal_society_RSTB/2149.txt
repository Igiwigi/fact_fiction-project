‘7 nerve, i.e, about 10 per cent. of the area in question (cf the curves in fig. 4).
This, however, is not all, as it does not take into consideration the fact that the

most caudal of these branches are also considerably stronger in the ¢ than in the °,

Consequently, could the mass (7.¢., sectional area) of the nerves supplying this area
be recorded, the difference between the two sexes on this point would be rendered
still more striking.

Tn connection with the same point may be mentioned the fact that in the case of
several males (fig. 2, Nos. 7, 9, 16) the most caudal of the fin nerves joined the next
anterior one before entering the fin, thus forming what might be regarded as a small
posterior collector (Plate 13, fig. 3). This point, however, will be returned to later, in

Fig. 4.
