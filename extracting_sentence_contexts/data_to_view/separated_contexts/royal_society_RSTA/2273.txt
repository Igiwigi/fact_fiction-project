This is easily done in a few trials by successive
approximation, and values for Lp: Lg:Ly, are obtained in the process which give
an exact luminosity summation to the assumed visibility curve. But these luminosity
factors may be quite fictitious, and may not represent the proportions by luminosity,
in which the three primaries have to be combined to match white. â€˜This is especially

the case with the blue primary. Owing to the relatively low luminosity of this primary
as compared with the red and green, and the manner in which the positive and negative
values of these two primaries appear in the blue and violet region of the spectrum, a
small error, either in the trichromatic coefficients in this neighbourhood, or in the
assumed visibility curve in the neighbourhood, may make a large difference in the value
of Ly which is required to give the desired luminosity summation.
