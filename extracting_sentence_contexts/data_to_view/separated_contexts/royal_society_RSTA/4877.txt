It is now
easy to verify that, when gp is reduced modulo 2, the obtained polynomial must indeed be equal
to &(F), as given by the numerator of formula (2.2). In particular, the result of this process is
independent of the lifting. In fact, in our computations we will use a simpler lifting. We shall always compute the
discriminants in general settings, where all of the coefficients of F are either 0, 1 or a symbol from
a set of variables V, never any explicit value in F;. Thus we need only lift the coefficients from
F,[V] to Z[V], which can be done, for example, by lifting 0,1 € Fz to 0,1 € Z.
