It occurred to me
that evidence” of their isolation might be found in the beautiful experiments of
M. Taexarv®, which led to the discovery of oxygenated water. It will be remem-
bered, in fact, that the first conclusion which that eminent philosopher drew from
them was that the phenomena were due to such combinations of the acids with
oxygen; and it was only after a long course of further investigation that he rested in
the opinion that the extra equivalent of oxygen was in all cases united to the water
with whieh' they were mixed. He at the same time allowed that the combination was
greatly more permanent when any acid was present.' I was in hopes that/I might have
obtained further evidence of the fact from an apparatus which I contrived for the pur-
pose, but the' results were not conclusive, and'I shall not trouble'you with the details.

214 PROFESSOR DANIELL ON THE ELECTROLYSIS OF SECONDARY COMPOUNDS,

You will doubtless remember that in my last letter I communicated to you the
anomalous and perplexing results which I obtained from the electrolysis of different
mixtures of sulphuric acid and water.
