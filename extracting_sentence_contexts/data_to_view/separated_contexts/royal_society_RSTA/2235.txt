But then, if one can speak of the value that R} would have had if one measured q = 1 in
context c = 1 instead of measuring q = 2 in context c = 2, then one can also speak of what the value
of RE would have been if the same q = 1 were measured in context c = 3. And the requirement that
the assignment of values should only depend on content would then dictate that R? be assigned
the same value as R}. The picture we arrive at now is: irrespective of what factual measurements are made, all
random variables are assigned values, and we ask whether this can be done so that any two Ri
and RE be assigned the same value. Assume that this is possible, i.e. the system is non-contextual
in the counterfactual sense. Then Ri and Ri, being always equal to each other, are jointly
distributed.
