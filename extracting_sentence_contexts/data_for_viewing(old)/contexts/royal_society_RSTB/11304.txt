Archaeology generates vast amounts of empirical data related to material out-
comes of human social learning. These data range in scale from individual
artefact traits (e.g. decorations on pots) to global trait distributions (the spread
of farming) and records of technological change spanning millions of years
(stone tool ‘modes’, sensu Clarke [1]). Archaeologists also routinely gather data
that give environmental, demographic and social context to the evolution of
material culture. These anthropic and contextual data are particularly well
suited to studying long-run effects of distinct cultural transmission mechanisms
on material cultural evolution; identifying phylogenetic relationships among arte-
facts; tracking long-term cultural stability, rates of change and diffusions of
innovations; and exploring cultural extinctions, instances of convergent cultura!
evolution and other evolutionary outcomes that may not be predicted by current
models. Nonetheless, many of these are still relatively infrequent (or entirely
unexplored) subjects of archaeological analysis using Darwinian concepts and
methods (cf. [2]). This is partly because archaeological data are complex and
more often present a fragmentary record of aggregated events than a clear and
detailed account of cultural evolutionary forces acting over long timespans; we
perceive a gulf between the person-to-person exchanges that drive cultural trans-
mission and the much coarser grain of the archaeological record. But, while
