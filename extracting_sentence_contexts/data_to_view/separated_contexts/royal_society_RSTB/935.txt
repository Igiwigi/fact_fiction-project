Rise of Pressure from Return of Tonus in Arterioles. Attention has already been drawn to the fact that recovery of pressure, after sm
‘doses of pure nitrite of amyl, may occur without any direct pulse acceleration.
no evidence of increase in the amount of blood discharged from the heart at eq
contraction is derivable from a study of the pulse, the return of contraction to ¢
arterioles which had been dilated by the nitrite must be regarded as the cause of
rise.. The instances (observed in cats) in which a fall of pressure was followed by
return to the normal without the occurrence of acceleration, are not those alone |
which the original fall is insignificant; on the contrary this phenomenon is oft
observed during the earlier administrations of the nitrite in which the fall is so
as to amount to from 30 to 44 per cent. of the total pressure. On looking over a large number of experiments (on cats) it appears that admin
stration of from zz to zs cub. centim. of nitrite is followed, in about 27 per cent.
cases, by one of the three following conditions, (1) by a slight slowing of the pulse i
2 per cent., (2) by no alteration, (3) by an increase of one or two beats per minut
In the remaining 73 per cent. there is a marked acceleration.
