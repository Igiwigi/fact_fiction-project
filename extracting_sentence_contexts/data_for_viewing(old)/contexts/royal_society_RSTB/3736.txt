the median habenular ganglion (fig. 55), and with the latter it forms a prominent
projection into the brain-cavity in the middle line, just in front of the recessus
infra-pinealis (fig. 62).

The right and left habenular ganglia project upwards from the postero-dorsal
margins of the optic thalami to join the wall of the dorsal sac; they also bulge
inwards towards the middle line so as to constrict the opening of the dorsal sac into
the lower portion of the third ventricle. These relations are clearly shown in
figs. 54 and 61. Fig. 54 also shows that the left habenular ganglion is of a somewhat
different shape from the right one, being gradually drawn out upwards into the wall
of the dorsal sac. This difference appears to be constant, for I have observed it in
all of my three series of transverse sections (Sphenodon I, III, VI), and it is
associated with the fact that at this point a specially strongly developed bundle of
nerve-fibres (n. p. e.), doubtless from the pineal eye, enters the ganglion from the
wall of the dorsal sac, as also shown in the longitudinal section represented in fig. 61.

The right and left habenular ganglia meet together posteriorly in a median portion
which lies above the superior commissure (figs. 55, 57, 62, G. H. M.). Some idea of
the shape of the ganglia and of the arrangement of the ganglion-cells may be gained
from a study of the figures.
