Striking evidence that the base of the valley was once the bed of the glacier. The rocks

Zare polished and striated, and present at some places the appearance of huge rounded

Emounds, which, at first sight, would appear to offer an insuperable barrier to the motion

Sof the glacier, but which show by their aspect that the ice actually moved over them,

Sgrinding off their angles and furrowing their summits and sides. All along the valley

Ltowards Meyringen, similar evidences exist. In fact. the phenomenon is very common,
and admitted on all hands.

A The conclusion which Mr. HoykiNs has drawn from these facts is unavoidable ; the
glaciers must have s/idden over the rocks on which such traces are left. 'To an eye a
little practised in those matters, the precise limits reached by the ancient glaciers are
perfectly visible. The junction of the rounded and abraded portions of the mountains,
with those portions which in ancient times rose over the then existing ice, is per-
fectly distinct ; and I should say in the valley of the Aar reaches to a height of more
than a thousand feet above the present bed of the river. The valley of Saas, in the
Canton de Valais, furnishes magnificent examples of the same kind.

At all places, from the base of the ancient glacier to its surface, sliding must have
