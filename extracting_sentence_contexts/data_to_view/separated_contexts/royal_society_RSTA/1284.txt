Thus,
the presence of various mass transfer mechanisms, which operate synchronously, shifts the bell-
shaped distribution function, as a whole, in the direction of smaller particle radii. Moreover, the
smaller the blocking point, the greater the shift. Taking the initial tail of the distribution function
into account leads to the fact that the right branch rises and falls to the right of the blocking
point of the Lifshitz-Slyozov theory (at u > uy > ug). It is also significant that the exponent n of
the initial ‘tail’ of the distribution function has a crucial role in the behaviour of vy(u) and P(u)
(compare the corresponding panels in figures 1 and 2). Indeed, these functions undergo larger
shifts when increasing the exponent n (when the initial ‘tail’ is steeper).
