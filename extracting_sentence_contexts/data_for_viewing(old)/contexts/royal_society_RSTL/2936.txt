living, and that when it has arrived at that point, whatever it happens to be, a copious
cutaneous transpiration takes place; and if the temperature be still increased, the
body of the insect becomes bathed in perspiration, and its temperature is immedi-
ately begun to be reduced. Now the degree unto which the temperature of insects
may be increased aboye that of the medium in which they are living, varies in the
different species as well as in the different genera of insects; each species has a cer-
tain standard of its own, beyond which its increase of temperature cannot he carried.
In some insects, as in the Hive Bee, this may perhaps amount to from fifteen to
twenty degrees, while in others it perhaps scarcely exceeds one or two degrees above
the temperature of the surrounding medium. Besides this, it has been found that
insects haye a power of generating heat when confined in a given space, and that this
power is in proportion to the activity of respiration. I have had numerous proofs of
this fact in my observations on the varying temperature of the hive.

My experiments on the hive were conducted in the following manner : a common
straw hive was placed with its entrance hole in the direction of another wooden hive,
which was standing beside it in a bee-honse, which was s0 constructed that the whole
of the back part of the house could be removed or closed at pleasure. The proper
entrance for the bees at the front of the bee-house was directly into the wooden hive,
from the side of which there was a little covered communication with the entrance
hole of the straw hive, to serve as a passage for the hees and a connection between
the wooden and straw hive. The object of this was to prevent any sudden effect
upon the temperature of the hive by changes which might occur in the temperature
of the air without. The interior of the straw hive was thus subjected as little as pos-
sIble to the variations in the open atmosphere, since the bees were obliged to pass
