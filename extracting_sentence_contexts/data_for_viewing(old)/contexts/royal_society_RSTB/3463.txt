normally sterile region than in another it is, perhaps, at the antipodal end. Since,

however, this is not of general occurrence, it is probably not connected with the
tendency to establish polarity seen in the earlier stage, but is rather due to
the fact that growth of the sac is not uniform. The exceptional occurrence
of a sac in which all the nuclei retain their sexuality and no endosperm is formed
rather indicates that Welwitschia is descended from forms in which all the nuclei were
potential gametes at the time of fertilisation, and the conditions were such that any
one of them, wherever situated, might be fertilised. Theoretically these conditions
are realised in the species of Gnetum studied by Karsten.

The lack of polarity inthe embryo-saes of Peperomia, Juglans, and other Angiosperms*
in which there are retained other characters reasonably regarded as primitive, justifies
the belief that the more typical angiosperm-sac has been derived from a form in which
the polar arrangement did not persist beyond the bi-nucleate stage. A considerable
reduction in the number of nuclei formed—owing to the organisation of the functional
gametes in an earlier generation than in Welwitschia or Gnetum—especially if
