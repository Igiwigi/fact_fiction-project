Resting motor threshold (MEPs >
100 pV in at least 5/10 trials, cf. [48]) was determined, and
cTBS intensity was calibrated to 80% of resting motor threshold
in accordance with former studies [49]. This value was then

used for all stimulation protocols of the participant including
the second and third experimental session. All three experimen-
tal sessions were identical to the first one except for the fact
that the motor threshold was assessed only at the first session. The stimulation site (right insular, right somatosensory cortices
or central occipital cortex as sham location) was selected
using a randomized protocol for all three experimental sessions,
ie. each participant was stimulated three times in a repea-
ted measurements design with identical test protocols. The
experimental procedure is depicted in figure 1.
