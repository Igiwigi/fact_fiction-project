As the intermediate
sack is well known to expand like a funnel in its passage up the seed (e.g., specimen
1930, phot. 5), there is no doubt the smaller ring belongs to the lower section.*

The peripheral position of the bundles, as determined by the specimen U. C. L., R. 7, b
(fig. 29), and the fact that they run into the free part of the integument or canopy,
seems to stamp the bundles as definitely appertaining to the integument of the seed. Turning now to the structure of the seed-bundles, it is mainly the xylem strands
that are preserved. In the transversely cut chalazal bundle in the specimen, 8. 236
(fig. 4), the xylem is shown with its smallest elements at the centre.
