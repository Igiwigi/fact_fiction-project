triplet states

In the past four decades, several types of organic materials with RISC from upper triplet
levels have been reported, such as anthracene derivatives [12], organic dyes [13], excited-state
intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) materials [14-16], etc. The chemical structures of some
representative materials are shown in figure 2.

Anthracenes are representative examples of molecules showing TSLIFs [17]. Early researches
on meso-substituted anthracenes found that their fluorescence yields increase with decreasing
temperature and no triplet formation can be detected at 77 K [18,19]. These facts are explained by
thermally activated ISC from S, to T2. Out of interest in this ISC from S, to Tz, Kobayashi et al. [20]
found that the RISC from Tz to S; also occurred when the metastable T; was further excited into
higher triplet states. Through systematical study, they established the quantum yields of T2 >
S; ISC (®s) of anthracene, 9-methylanthracene, 9-phenylanthracene, 9,10-dichloroanthracene
and 9,10-dibromoanthracene to be 2.6 x 1075, 3.6 x 1074, 4.7 x 1074, 1.5 x 10-2 and 2.7 x 107,
respectively. The significant increases of ®;, in meso-derivatives are interpreted in terms of level
inversion of T2 and S; due to the substitution at the meso-position, assuming that S, <— Ty
absorption cross section is negligible in comparison with T,, <T, absorption cross section. As
for the halogenated anthracenes, the increased ®; could be attributed to the internal heavy
atom effect.

The RISC from upper triplet levels is also observed in some organic dyes [21], such as flavins
