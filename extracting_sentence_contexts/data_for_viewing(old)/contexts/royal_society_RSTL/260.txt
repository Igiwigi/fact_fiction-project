be considerably weaker than this, and the other parts of the
ship considerably stronger ; but since the fastenings appear to
possess sufficient strength to resist any strain which is actually
likely to affect them, there seems to be no inconvenience in
their inferiority to the other parts. In fact, the Tremendous
actually supported, for three days, without any perceptible
change of form, a strain fully equal to that which is here cal-
culated, having been purposely left on shores, which extended
through z2 feet only of her length. But it must be re-
membered, that such a force, from its very gradual application,
must be much less trying to the ship's strength, than the more
abrupt changes which occur at sea, and it must on the whole
be inferred, that it would be unsafe to trust to the braces alone,
unsupported by the cooperation of the neighbouring parts.
It would probably be easy to add some further strength to
these braces near the ends of the ship, where the strain on
them is the greatest, especially about go feet from the head,
