I have obseryed that the magnetic intensity is subject to frequent slight
variations; but these I haye been mostly unable to refer to any obvious cause,
except when accompanied by the appearance of the aurora borealis, which eyi-
dently affected the needles on many occasions. Their vibrations, I think,
generally became less rapid with a moist atmosphere, and more 80 when it was
very dry; but I do not speak with full confidence on this point, as I have only
recently made any regular hygrometrical observations. I might, perhaps, also
mention changes of the wind, and snow storms, as being sometimes attended
with fluctuations in the intensity of the needles. If the times of their vibration
at different periods are compared, differences in their relative intensity will be
noticed ; that of No. 2. having on the average been diminishing, during the last
three months nearly, in a more rapid ratio than No. 1. This must, I think, be
considered an interesting fact, if confirmed by future observations. It does

* If the rivets which attach the magnetic bar to the support are placed at a proper distance from
the acting pole, the equipoise of the two extremities will not be affected by the contraction or expan-
sion of the bar.

+ The neutralization of the pole would haye been more fully effected had a smaller proportion of it
extended beyond the centre of suspension ; 14 to 14 an inch would probably haye been sufficient.
