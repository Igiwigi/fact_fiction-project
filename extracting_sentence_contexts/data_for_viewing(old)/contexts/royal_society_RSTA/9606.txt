further drying of the surfaces. With most cells the agreement with the inverse
square law is not so good, the results at 10 cm being generally too small by some
5to 10% compared with the values found at 40 or 50 cm, even when the calculated
correction has been made for the sizes of the source and window.


THE STANDARDIZATION OF PHOTO-ELECTRIC CELLS 19

Several suggestions may be offered to account for this discrepancy, but none of
them is very convincing: (1) It does not appear probable a prior that we are
underestimating the “ size of source” correction, as we are treating the lamp as
radiating as a plane surface when estimating the effect of the window size, and, by
disregarding the fact that the centre of the latter is generally more effective than
the edge, we are probably over-estimating its effective diameter. (2) It is possible
that refraction in the glass of the lamp bulb may have slightly increased the effective
distance, but the test made with the projector lamp, already referred to in this
connection, would seem to indicate that this effect is small. (3) If the diffusing
power of the opal glass were inadequate it would not be correct to take the distance
from the filament to this glass as the effective distance, but rather something greater,
as the cell is behind the glass. To test this point a selenium rectifier cell was mounted
in a box at about 4:7 cm behind a 4 cm opal window so that the whole could be
rotated about a vertical axis through the centre of the window. Even with the cell
at this distance from the window, the reading was proportional to the cosine of the
obliquity to within 1 or 2% over a wide range of values when allowance had been
made for the increase in reflection loss with obliquity. The diffusing power of
