Echinodermata.—Physiologists, from TiEpeEMANN to MULLER, commonly describe in

this family three distinct systems of fluids ; that, 1st, of the general cavity of the body;
that, 2ndly, of the feet and water-canals ; and that, 3rdly, of the blood-proper. The
doctrine which maintains the perfect independence of these three orders of fluids, is
advocated by these two illustrious anatomists. Facts will now be adduced which
render it probable that these three apparently independent systems constitute really
only a single indivisible fluid-system. They will be found to warrant no other con-
clusion than that in Echinoderms the system of the blood-proper is s0 rudimentarily
formed, that its contents, by some means and in some undetermined manner, commu-
nicate and mingle with those of the general cavity of the body, since in every histolo-
gical character the morphous elements and chemical compositions of the two fluids
prove, under every mode of inquiry, to be identical. From the same method of
examination, the inference is confidently drawn that the contents of the vascular
system of the feet (* Das Wassergefisssystem ” of MULLER and TiepeMANN) are iden-
tical, chemically and histologically, with those of the visceral cavity.
