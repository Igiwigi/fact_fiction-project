and let X,, X, be the single quantities, roots of the equation
c - 4—X |
or
X*—(a+4d)X +ad—be=0.
The equation satisfied by the matrix may be written
(M=X,(M—X,)=0.

in which X,, X,, are to be considered as respectively involving the matrix unity, and it
would at first sight seem that we ought to have one of the simple factors equal to zero,
which is obviously not the case, for such equation would signity that the perfectly inde-
terminate matrix M was equal to a single quantity, considered as involving the matrix
unity. The explanation is that each of the simple factors is an indeterminate matrix,
in fact M—X, stands for the matrix

( a—R, b I:
| ec , 4d—X,

and the determinant of this matrix is equal to zero. 'The product of the two factors is
thus equal to zero without either of the factors being equal to zero.

29. A matrix satisfies, we have seen, an equation of its own order, involving the
coefficients of the matrix; assume that the matrix is to be determined to satisfy some
other equation, the coefficients of which are given single quantities. It would at first
sight appear that we might eliminate tle matrix between the two equations, and thus
obtain an equation which would be the only condition to be satisfied by the terms
