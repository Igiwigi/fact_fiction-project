dp=- [eva —22)p + ed dt + VeDsw (5.2)

and

dx = pdt, (5.3)

where € < 1 is a bookkeeping parameter. We then introduce the action-angle variables (see [18,23])

2 4 42,2
pote p
J yan 0 =—arctan (4) (5.4)

that is motivated by the fact that equations (5.2)-(5.3) for « = 0 describe the Hamiltonian system.
The action variable J is then the oscillator energy divided by the natural frequency and the
corresponding equation of motion is j = 0. For € « 1, damping and noise intensity are small which
implies that j is also small and J is changing slowly with time.

Following Ito’s lemma, we get
