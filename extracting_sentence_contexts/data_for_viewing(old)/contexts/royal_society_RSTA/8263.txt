—Assumed proportion of calcium 5 per cent. by mass (¢ = 0-05); assumed photospheric opacity,
« = 0-85 P/(T/10*)%* (P = electron-pressure in dynes cm~®. ; N) = number of neutral atoms down to
7 =} percent.; N, = number of ionized atoms down to t = } per cent.

Note (1).—No + N, is the “total number of atoms above the photosphere ” (actually above + = }).
It represents the total number of neutral atoms of any constituents ionizable only with difficulty,
and thus gives, for example, the behaviour of BALMER lines with gravity at low temperatures.

Note (2).—The single datum from which the curves are calculated is the observed Zn maximum in Gy type
stars.

Note (3)—The observed points were all obtained by an entirely independent method, the line-contours
method of Unséxp, assuming a formula for the atomic scattering coefficient. The fact that the calcu-
lated curves pass through the neighbourhoods of the observed points checks the general correctness
of the aggregate of assumptions made and formule used.
