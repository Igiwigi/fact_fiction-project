Such
an approach can give significant process performance improvements of up to one order of
magnitude. Likewise, most biological reactions are carried out in an aqueous medium. Despite the fact that
water is a benign reagent, this is far from ideal as described earlier, because many compounds
of industrial interest (reactants and products) are either poorly water soluble, or inhibitory
at low concentrations, or both. Among the strategies to overcome such challenges is reactor
compartmentalization, which involves separation of the reactor into two ‘compartments’. In one
compartment, the reactant is present at a high concentration, and in the other (the reaction
medium containing the enzyme) at a low concentration.
