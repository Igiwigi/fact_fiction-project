The same argument holds for the


Antarctic. However, in the Southern Hemisphere, sea ice shows evidence of being increasingly
transported eastward and changes in thicknesses are smaller than in the north. The fact that the coupled system responds differently to a stochastic sea ice parametrization
compared with an uncoupled model highlights the fact that care has to be taken when results from
uncoupled experiments are extrapolated to the coupled climate system. The results suggest that
by incorporating the atmosphere a negative feedback is introduced that prevents the stochastic
effect in the coupled model from accumulating. Given the slowness of the accumulation process
in the uncoupled model (figure 1), it is likely that even a relatively weak negative atmospheric
feedback would be sufficient to prevent the stochastic sea ice parametrization from influencing
the mean climate of the coupled system.
