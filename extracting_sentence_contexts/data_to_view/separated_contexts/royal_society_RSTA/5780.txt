hygiene precautions to more severe actions such as the mandatory stay-at-home and business and
schools closures. These measures were intended to diminish transmission rates and, to this end, aimed at
reducing person-to-person contacts via social distancing. In fact, even if the precise role played by
those interventions has still to be carefully understood in view of a deeper comprehension of the
transmission mechanisms of the disease [2,3], it has been recognized how the social attitudes of a
population are a crucial feature for the spreading of airborne diseases [4,-8]. Thus, it appears that
understanding the interplay between social heterogeneity and clinical characteristics of a disease
is an essential feature to design efficient and robust countermeasures in the near future. The classical epidemiological models [9] are usually based on a compartmentalization of the
population, denoted in the following by C, in which the agents composing the system are split into
epidemiologically relevant states, like susceptible, who can contract the disease, and several other
classes of agents who may transmit it.
