Higher values for the mean electric moment are obtained, as is evident from Table I.,
if the data from discharges at greater distances than 15 km. are used. The records
of discharges at great distances may possibly give disproportionately large values for
the mean electric moment for two reasons: (1) because at these distances discharges
of small electric moment are unrecorded on account of the small magnitude of the
charges of potential gradient produced by them; and (2) because it is only at great
distances that discharges, which do not reach the earth and which may be of great
vertical length and have large electric moments, produce effects proportional to their
moments. The sign of the effect of such discharges is in fact reversed at small
distances, and the magnitude of the sudden change of potential gradient produced
becomes more nearly proportional to the height of the lower end of the discharge
than to its vertical length (fig. 3). Some additions to the data of Table I. were furnished by the storm of June 17,
1917, in which the distance and frequency of the flashes were too great to admit of
the distances of the individual discharges being estimated. There was in this case
(see p. 80) independent evidence as to the approximate distance of the storm when
the trace containing records of 95 positive and 40 negative discharges within 10
minutes was obtained.
