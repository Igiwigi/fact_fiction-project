For

It is worth pointing out in the context of this low-dose dis- 13 different definitions of those terms, inconclusive and not
cussion that the application of CA certainly does not imply supporting each other. Additionally, special care has to be
that each and every pharmaceutical mixture is of ecotoxicolo- taken to account for the fact that CA and IA usually predict
gical relevance nor that every compound present is actually different mixture toxicities, and a mixture whose toxicity is

worth considering (figure 1). But, neither CA nor IA provide perfectly predictable by CA is hence ‘synergistic’ in relation


to IA, and vice versa. Explicitly specifying the frame of refer- inflexibility of the median effect principle matters least, the
