180 I. MANTON ON EVIDENCE ON SPIRAL STRUCTURE

a comparable body of evidence does not appear to exist for any other cytologically
worked organism the risk of error is perhaps worth taking. No disparagement of other investigators is intended by this last remark, since our
knowledge of the best-known cytological types such as Zea, Tradescantia, Fritillaria,
Stenobothrus, Osmunda, is in each case a composite one to which each generation of
workers has contributed. Certain facts about all these types are by now sufficiently
clear, in a descriptive if not in a causal sense. In each case, however, the sum of
published descriptions is deficient, either in details of spiral structure, or in knowledge
of chromosome lengths at crucial stages such as leptotene, to name only two of the
most important omissions. Yet the discovery of spiral structure alone, or rather its
rediscovery* in recent years, is probably one of the most far-reaching facts with which
modern cytology has to deal.
