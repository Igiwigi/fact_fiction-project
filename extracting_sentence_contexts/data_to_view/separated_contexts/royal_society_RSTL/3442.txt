Again, zinc and cadmium. in strong nitric
acid; the cadmium was positive strongly to the zinc; the same metals being in dilute
nitric acid, the zine was very positive to the cadmium. These I consider beautiful
and unexceptionable cases (1999.).

2004. Thus the nitric acid furnishes a most wonderful variety of effects when used
as the electrolytic conductor in voltaic circles; and its difference from sulphuric acid
(1995.) or from potassa (1994.) in the phenomena consequent upon dilution, tend, in
conjunction with many preceding facts and arguments, to show that the electromotive
force in a circle is not the consequence of any power in bodies generally, belonging
to them in classes rather than as individuals, and having that simplicity of character
which contact force has been assumed to have, but one that has all the variations
which chemical force is known to exhibit.

2005. The changes occurring where any one of four or five metals, differing from
each other as far as silyer and tin, can be made positive or negative to the others
(1997. 1998.), appears to me to shut out the probability that the contact of these
metals with each other can produce the smallest portion of the effect in these voltaic
arrangements; and then, if not there, neither can they be effective in any other ar-
rangements;; 80 that what has been deduced in that respect from former experiments
(1829. 1833.) is confirmed by the present.

2006. Or if the scene be shifted, and it be said that it is the contact of the acids or
80lutions which, by dilution at one side, produce these varied changes (1874. 1982.
1991. 2014. 2060.), then how utterly unlike snch contact must be to that of the
numerous eclass of conducting solid bodies (1809. 1867.) ; and where, to give the
assumption any show of support, is the case of such contact (apart from chemical
action) producing such currents ?
