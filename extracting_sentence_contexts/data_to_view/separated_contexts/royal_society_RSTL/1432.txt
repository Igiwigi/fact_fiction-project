Ivory on the expansion

whieh-equation is-true when we make 7= a. This analysis
is equivalent to the demonstration-of M. Porsson.- Whatever
may be thought of the reasoning, it cannot be denied that,'in
both'processes, y/ is in fact treated as a constant quantity,
The equation is true of each individual molecule taken'sepa-
rately, and merely because its thickness has some-determminate
value. Such a demonstration cannot therefore be employed
to prove that the thickness of a series/of molecules covering
the surface of a'sphere, or a part of that surface, follows a
certain law of variation; 'or comes” under a particular deve-
lopement. -

But a legitimate process'of reasoning requires that, in the
formula (A), while a represents any determinate quantity
less- than 7, y' be” considered as a function of the variable
quantities sin 6',"cos'#/,'sin'@', cos'p'; and likewise that the
integration be extended to the whole: surface of the sphere,
or to that part of it covered with the related molecules ; after
which the true value" of the: formiila. will be obtained by
making a=r. The whole system of molecules being com-
prehended in the result, we may thence: deduce, by a reverse
process, the law according-to which their thickness must vary,
in order to produce that 'result. -Now- the integration here
spoken of, cannot be execiited; unless-in the case when y' is
explicitly a function of three rectangular co-ordinates.
