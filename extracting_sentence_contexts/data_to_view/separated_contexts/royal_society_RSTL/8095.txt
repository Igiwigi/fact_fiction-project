Table. The fact may then be simply stated, that in the case of lead the complexity of
the spectrum increases as the atomic weight of the non-metallic element with which it
is combined decreases. BARIUM. The next metal experimented on was barium, an element of much lower atomic weight
than lead, and in this respect, occupying a position not very much above the mean atomic
weight of the elements.
