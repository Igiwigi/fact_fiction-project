Sir Benjamin Trwomeson's Experiments, &, By
ments, I flatter myſelf that you will not think an account of
my labours upon this ſubje& altogether unintereſting,

Before I enter upon the detail of my experiments it will be
neceffary to premiſe, that I ſhall in general confine myſelf
"merely to the fadts as they appear, without applying them to
the confirmation or refutation of the theories of others, and
without entering into any ſpeculative enquiries relative to their
emote cauſes; and in deſcribing the different appearances I
Ahall make uſe of the moſt familiar terms. Thus, in ſpeaking
f theair produced upon expoſing raw filk in water to the aftion
Sof light, I ſhall ſometimes mention it as being yielded by the
S6ilk ; and 1 ſhall ſometimes ſpeak of the air furniſhed by ex-
Foſing water, which has previouſly turned green, in the ſun's
rays, as being immediately produced by the water, though it is
Zprobable, that the green matter ads a very important part in
Zthe produQtion of this air in the one- caſe and in the other. But
F- ow it a&tsis not well aſcertained ; and I had in general much
Srather confine myſelf to a ſimple, and even 2a unlearned, de-
S\cription of faCts, than by endeayouring to give more preciſe
Sdefinitions, at firſt, to involve myſelf in all the difficulties
Z'which would attend accounting for phznomena, whoſe cauſes
Z are but very imperfe&tly known. S You will, therefore, not be ſurpriſed, if you ſhould ſome-
2 times find me ſpeaking of appearances in the fame manner as
Za perſon would mention them who ſaw them for the firſt time,
