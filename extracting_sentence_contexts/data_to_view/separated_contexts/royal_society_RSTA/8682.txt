This is in accordance with such evidence
as exists in the case of zero yaw (ยง 1.01). If, moreover, the component M were seriously affected by the
spin, the effect would have been detected by the present trial. No such effect was found (see ยง 4.13), and
this fact provides some evidence of the validity of the above assumption, at least as a first approximation. The spin N will, however, give rise to certain additional components of the complete force system. There will be a couple I which tends to destroy N, and, when the shell is yawed, a sideways force, which
need not act through the centre of gravity, analogous to that producing swerve on a golf or tennis ball.
