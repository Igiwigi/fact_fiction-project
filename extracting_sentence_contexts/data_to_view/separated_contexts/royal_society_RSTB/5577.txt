RAISTRICK AND R. ROBINSON ON

analogies for such graded oxidation of a saturated side-chain in the aromatic series are
of very doubtful validity, and it is usually found that permanganate oxidizes fully
saturated chains so as to produce derivatives of benzoic acid. On the view that IL is a methylethylresorcinol dimethyl ether, it is possible to
represent the formation of IIT and TV in accordance with the scheme :—

(MeO),CsH,Me.CO,H +— (MeO),C,H,MeEt —+ (Me0),C,HsBt-CO,H.
(IIT) (II) (IV)

Fortunately, it was possible to show that this scheme does, in fact, represent
the degradation, because both IIT and IV are derivatives of benzoic acid. The direct
attachment of the carboxyl group to the nucleus was proved in both cases by applying
the Currius reaction to the acids; the amines ultimately obtained were diazotisable
and the resulting diazonium salts coupled with 8-naphthol to unmistakable azo-com-
