On reversal of the current the variations were reversed.

The whole series of these variations was exactly as might have been anticipated.
They were uniformly such as to indicate potential of the same sign in the vicinity of
either pole as compared with the potential at more distant parts. It is worth again
calling attention to the fact that potential at leg agreed with sign of pole at apex,
while potential at mouth agreed with sign of pole at base, when the body was led off

* Tt is often very difficult by inspection to distinguish between such variations; in the above case it
was impossible to say whether the variation consisted of two movements in the same direction (8S), or
of two movements in the same direction separated by a movement in the opposite direction (snS) ; the
latter is probably the correct reading.

to the electrometer from leg and mouth. And I may add that I also experimentally
verified the fact that, while potential at mouth agreed with sign of pole at base,
