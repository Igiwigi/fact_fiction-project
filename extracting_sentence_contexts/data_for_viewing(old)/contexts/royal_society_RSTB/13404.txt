(e.g. sex-specific expression) to transition to a sex chromosome.
On the other hand, the hypothesis that sexual antagonism can
favour the location of a sex-determining gene in a region
enriched by genes with sexually antagonistic effects received
support by non-random fusions of certain autosomes with sex
chromosomes in iguanas [177] and songbirds [139]. Particularly
in songbirds, one region fused to the ancestral ZZ/ZW was
found to be enriched in genes with predicted sex-related func-
tions [139]. Non-random fusions can, however, be explained
by the close physical proximity of particular chromosomes in
the nucleus, as recently supported by the analyses of the mul- Authors’ contributions. L.K. drafted the first version of the manuscript,
