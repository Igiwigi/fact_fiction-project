It was at once
clear that this would necessitate a revision of the 10 °%, difference of intensity proposed by
the author, and the adoption of some lower figure. It is important that this point should be
fully appreciated, for as these revised acuities are reported as the result of further research,
the idea seems to be prevalent that they refute the author’s theory (Hartridge 1922@). Such
is not the case, however; the value of the least perceptible intensity difference may need
revision from time to time, but the theory itself will remain unchallenged until some one
proves that resolution is in fact taking place when there are no differences of light intensity

to be perceived by the fovea.

602 H. HARTRIDGE ON THE

(112) The limits to visual acuity

Four factors are now known to determine acuity in the case of the human eye. Two of
these concern the lens system, and two concern the retinal receptors; they are:

(a) diffraction at the pupil;

(b) the aberrations;

(c) the fineness of the retinal mosaic;

(d) the ability to detect differences of brightness.
