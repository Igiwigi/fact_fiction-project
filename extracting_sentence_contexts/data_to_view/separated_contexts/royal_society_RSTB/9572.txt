Initial studies focused on understanding how LptD and LptE
interact. Chng et al. [41] found that LptD and LptE co-purify ina
stable 1:1 complex when a polyhistidine-tag is installed on
LptE. In fact, LptD cannot be overexpressed without LptE, and
the C-terminal domain of LptD strongly protects LptE from pro-
teolytic degradation [41]. This finding led to the development of
the plug-and-barrel model, in which LptE resides in the lumen of
the beta-barrel of LptD. Guided by the structures of three LptE
orthologues, Freinkman et al. [42] introduced a photoactivatable
amino acid into LptE at various positions and found many to
contact LptD.
