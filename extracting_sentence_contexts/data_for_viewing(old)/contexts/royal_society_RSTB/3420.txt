sufficiently marked in each year to indicate that a second breeding season normally
exists in March, though as a rule it is much less marked than that of November.
Both these breeding periods are entirely without relation to the chief marriage
months.

Tn 1905, however, the second breeding season is specially emphasised ;' not only is
there a substantial advance on the increased birth-rate normally seen in Novemberâ€”
December, but there is an excess over that recorded for July ; thus the normal spring
breeding season was unusually boisterous that year. The exceptional fertility which
has already been noted for that year is no doubt due to the causes which induced
this specially vehement reproductive activity in March and April of the same year.

My belief that this is exceptional is strengthened by the following facts. The
total births for the following year (1906) are considerably lower than for 1905,
though higher than for 1904, and yet the highest number of births during the period
when most children are born is markedly lower in 1906 than it is in 1904, especially
among illegitimate births. In the same way the lowest birth-rate in 1906, though it
is normally low in February, is abnormally low again in September. Thus it is
obvious the breeding season which gives rise to the second high birth-rate period in
1905 has disturbed the normal breeding conditions in 1906.

Regarding the causes which conduce to exceptional reproductive activity at
these special times: I have drawn up tables of barometric pressure (corrected),
temperature (centigrade), and percentage of relative humidity for each month of
these three years, taking the daily mean records and averaging them for each month.
