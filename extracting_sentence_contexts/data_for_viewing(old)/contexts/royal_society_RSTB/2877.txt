conditions were probably derived from these, as a result of later evolution, the chief
feature of which was the interpolation of new sporangia; and, lastly, that the
suggested steps are in accordance with biological probability, as well] as with the
palzontological record.

The position at which we have arrived then is this: that though the mode of origin
of the various forms of Pteridophyta cannot in the nature of the case be proved, it
has been shown that the structural facts for their sporophyte are compatible with a
theory of progressive sterilisation of the tissues; that from comparison with Algze and
Bryophytes a suggestion is given how the earlier steps may have been taken in
producing a vegetative system by sterilisation of an enlarging sporophyte, and that in
the case of single cells, tissue-tracts, sporangia, and even whole sporophylls and their
appendages, facts are numerous in the Pteridophyta which are readily explained as
instances of such sterilisation. Correlatively increased vegetative growth is seen
in many cases, and as a result spore-production may be indefinitely delayed.

But the vegetative system, which thus takes its place first in the ontogeny, is
naturally liable to great modification, in accordance with its function, indeed it seems
not improbable that the vegetative and sporogenous systems, when once differentiated,
may vary independently of one another; this comes out with special clearness in the
Phanerogams, and particularly so in the case of parasites, this independent variation
of the vegatative and sporogenous regions has probably held, though in less degree, in
the Pteridophytes also. Comparative evidence of a common origin of the vegetative
and sporogenous systems would thus tend to be obliterated. So far is this the case
that in vascular plants the embryology and early vegetative development of the
