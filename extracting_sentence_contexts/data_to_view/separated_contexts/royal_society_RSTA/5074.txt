The coefficients C,(A, @) to be used with equation (2.1) are here derived in three different ways. The standard way is to use values obtained from steady-state rotor simulations under constant
wind. It is not straightforward to estimate (in fact, model) these coefficients accurately for many
different values of blade pitch and tip speed ratio, which also includes cases in significant stall
where the turbine slows down over a relatively long period of time to reach steady state. Typically,
the wind speed fluctuations move the turbine out of this regime long before the steady-state
behaviour is reached, and it is questionable how realistic the use of steady-state coefficients would
be in these cases. Therefore, the quasi-static model is only evaluated for the low wind speed of
6ms-! (case FcCtSteady).
