Figure 81, plate 10, shows the
dictyostelic shoot and leaf-bases of a still older specimen in which fourteen new â€˜leaf
primordia had developed; figure 80, plate 10, is a section of the same shoot but taken lower
down. As shown in figure 6, the outer limit of the stele in the lower region of an isolated terminal
region is parallel to the perimeter of the section. The stele, in fact, is of rectangular outline. In other instances where a triangular system of incisions was used (figures 9, 10), the stele
was of triangular outline; and in yet others where a rectangular system was used, the stele
was of rectangular outline. The shape of the stele, in fact, is directly related to the cross-
sectional outline of the isolated terminal region.
