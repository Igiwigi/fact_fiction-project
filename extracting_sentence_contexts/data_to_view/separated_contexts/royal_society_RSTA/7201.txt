Some distinctive features of the analysis

With reference to the foregoing analysis, it is worth emphasizing several points, an
appreciation of which will help to clarify the subsequent work.

(1) A method of solution which is physically straightforward is to express the incident
cylindrical field as an angular spectrum of plane waves, choosing a path of integration which
is such that the individual plane waves are essentially ‘down-coming’, thus avoiding any
ambiguity in deriving the corresponding reflected field. The resulting integral is con-
veniently handled by the method of steepest descents.

(2) The mathematics of the problem is characterized by certain poles and branch-points. In distorting the original path of integration to that of steepest descents no pole is ever
captured; but a complication arises from the fact that one may lie very close to the
saddle-point.

(3) When the earth is homogeneous there is symmetry about the plane through the line-
source T and its image 7” (figure 5). This symmetry expresses itself in the analysis by the
appearance of two relevant pairs of singularities, P,, B, and P,, B, (figures 7, 8). The former

come into play when y =7, the latter when 7 +0.

(4) In Sommerfeld’s method of solution a different complex plane of integration is
adopted in which the poles P; and P, appear in the upper sheet of the Riemann surface.
