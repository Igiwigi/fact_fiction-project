it} also, and-even to.have arrived at it
before, them; for, the time- taken tips in the heating or in the
cooling of any body,- is, ceteris paribus,as the capacity of the
body to- receive and-retain heat, -directly;'and as its conducting
power, inversely. The bottles, were: suspended/ tothe balance by silver wires,
about two inches long, with-hooks at-the ends of them ; and,
in removing. and changing the bottles, I took care not to touch
the glass., 1 likewise, avoided, upon all occasions, and particu-

weight, upon, being changed from a state of fluidity to that of
ice, and vice vers, I shall now take my final leave of a subject
which, has long} oceupied-me, and- which has cost me much
pains and trouble; being: fully-convinced, (from the results of
the above/ mentioned experiments, ) that if heat be in fact a $6-
Stance,,or.matter,—a fluid $7 generis, as has been supposed,—
which, passing- from. one body to/another, and being accunu-
lated, is the immediate cause-of the phenomena we observe in

heated bodies, (of which, however, I cannot help entertaining
doubts, ) it must be something 0 infinitely rare, even in'its most
condensed state, as to baffle all our attempts' to discover its gra-
vity. And, if the opinion which has been adopted by many of
our ablest philosophers, that heat is nothing more than an” in-
testine vibratory motion of the constituent parts of heated bodies,
should be well founded, it is clear that the weights of bodies can
in no wise be affected by such motion.
