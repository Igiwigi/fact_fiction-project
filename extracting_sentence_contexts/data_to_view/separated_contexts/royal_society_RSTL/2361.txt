and the resulting curves will be those required.

*'To produce this latter equality is the only difficulty in the operation, and to treat
it as a common equation would lead to immense labour. I have therefore always
contented myself with pursuing the more simple method of trial and error, its facility
fully compensating, in my mind, for its want of scientific elegance.

*It may be proper to observe, that I proposed the lens to double the magnifying
power, and the curyes were computed accordingly, but the formula: will of course
apply to magnifying in any ratio.

<T hope this explanation will be found intelligible, and I am pleased to find my
proposition has been found useful.

I have only to add to the foregoing relation of facts, that I do hope they will prove
satisfactory to those friends who have felt s0 much interested upon the subject as to
induce me to write this Paper, it not being my wish to take credit to myself for any-
thing like an invention, but merely for the application of the lens to the micrometer,
as I am fully convinced that a concave lens, either simple or achromatic, was never
50 applied before,
