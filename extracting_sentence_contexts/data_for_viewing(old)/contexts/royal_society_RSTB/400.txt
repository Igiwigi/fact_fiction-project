possibilities of wide differences from the times at which it is assumed that suspension
began or pupation took place, and therefore less importance is to be attached to the
estimates. The preparatory period had in all cases commenced before the larvae were
periodically examined, but in Larva 3, subdivision (a), 344 hours elapsed after the
examination began, â€˜This larva was evidently in Stage LI. at the commencement of the

investigation, but (probably on account of disturbance) it again wandered for a short
time, passing through another Stage I. of about 44 hours, and then again an
exceedingly short Stage II. of only a little over 24 hours, the final stage being, perhaps, a
little less than normal. These facts throw further light on the stages of certain larvee
which appear to be most abnormally short, and seem at first sight to show that it is
impossible to obtain an average duration for the stages which would be of any
practical value for the investigation of any particular larva. Such a conclusion might
be arrived at by comparing the exceedingly divergent estimates of Stages I. and II. in
Divisions B. and C. of this series, and also by comparing the estimated lengths of the
total periods in these two divisions respectively. But the above-described larva
shows us how after disturbance the whole preparatory period may begin again and all
its stages may be passed through, but that under these circumstances the stages,
and especially the two initial ones, are considerably abbreviated. It has been
remarked above that the larva may even feed again after disturbance and before the
recommencement of Stage I., so that the resemblance of the abbreviated period to one
of normal length may be very close. And there is independent evidence for this
