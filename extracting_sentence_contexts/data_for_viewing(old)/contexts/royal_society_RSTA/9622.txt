in comparison with the pressures and tensions set up, since these amount to several
tons on the square inch, and, practically speaking, the joint will transmit the pressure
wave unchanged but will sustain no tension.



440 MR. B. HOPKINSON ON MEASURING THE PRESSURE PRODUCED IN THE

Pressure Produced by the Impact of Lead Bullets.

The pressure which should be produced by the impact of a lead bullet can be
predicted theoretically, and the study of this pressure was made rather with a view
to checking the method than in the hope of discovering any new facts. At velocities
exceeding 1000 feet per second lead behaves on impact
against a hard surface practically as a perfect fluid.

The course of the impact is shown in fig. 4. The base of
the bullet at the moment of striking is at A; a little later
it is at B. Assuming perfect fluidity the base of the
bullet knows nothing of the impact at the nose and
continues to move forward with unimpaired velocity.
Hence the time elapsing between the two positions shown

in the figure is ae The momentum which has been destroyed up to this time is to
