ments, and to which all their other powers are subservient.

These other powers, it appears from what has been said, are the same in both,
namely, the muscular power and the powers of the living blood, and, in the sensitive
system, the nervous power itself; for in this system all the other powers of the living
animal are directly subjected to the sensorial power, while none of the powers of
the vital system have any direct influence on it, their influence on the sensorial
power being through the medium of its organs, the structure and wellbeing of
which immediately depend on the vital powers.

In other respects also the laws of the two systems essentially differ. Nor will these
differences 8urprise us, when it is recollected, as appears from the facts which have
been stated, that while the leading power in the vital system is one of those powers
which operate in the external world ; that of the sensitive system not only possesses
no properties in common with the agents of inanimate nature, but depends on a set
of organs unapproachable in their healthy functions by any such agents.
