inter-ambulacrum 5, in his younger specimen by plates 3a, 3b, 4a, 4b (Lovin, 1874,
Plate L., figs. 244 and 245). Apparently there is some slight variation with regard to
these plates. On p. 309 itis stated that, as a rule, the imago of Hchinarachnius parma
has four or five plates in the posterior inter-ambulacrum. ‘hus, as a rule plate 3b, or
plates 3b and 3a are present in the imago. In fig. 20 plate 4b separates plate 3b from
the periproct and doubtless would continue to do so throughout the life of the urchin.
At any rate, that holds good for the corresponding plate (5b) in Hehinocardium cordatum
(see GorDon, 1926, b, figs. 9 and 5). It seems, therefore, that the periproct is, as a
tule, enclosed by plates 4a, 4b, 5a and 5b. In imagines in which only plates 2a and 2b
of the posterior inter-ambulacrum are present, it is possible that plates 36 and 3a,
the first two plates to appear after metamorphosis, may remain in contact with the
periproct. The variation in the position of the periproct may therefore be due to the
fact that some imagines are less advanced than others.

When fig. 16, ©, of the present paper is compared with Lovin’s fig. 245 a striking
difference is at once apparent. In fig. 16, #, as already described on p. 309, the anterior
is much more advanced than the posterior half of the corona. In Lovan’s figure
(1874, Plate L., fig. 245) the corona is very regular and the posterior half of the corona
is almost as well developed asis the anterior half. ‘The following tables bring this out
quite clearly ; inter-ambulacra 1, 2, 3 and 4 are now equally well developed.* area 5
still lags somewhat behind ; the five ambulacra are equally well developed. It seems
therefore that the corona with large anterior and small posterior areas is characteristic
only of the imago and of very small urchins. During development this condition is
gradually altered so that in the adult all the ambulacra and all the inter-ambulacra are
almost equally well developed (Lovin, 1874, Plate L., fig. 244).
