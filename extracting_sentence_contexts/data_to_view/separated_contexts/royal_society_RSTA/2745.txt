In shifting focus away from the technology and toward the overall system including people,
it is additionally important to maintain focus on whether a system is fit for a purpose and meets
its design goals and specification. Fidelity to a systemâ€™s specification is one aspect of determining
whether that system is correct, although we might also demand that the specification itself satisfy
design goals or relate properly to the real world [16]. It is important both to validate that a system is
faithful to its specification and to verify that fact to affected parties. Connecting concerns along this
line is a large part of how we define correctness and how we measure whether systems are correct. Both contribute heavily to how well we can understand and introspect on a system.
