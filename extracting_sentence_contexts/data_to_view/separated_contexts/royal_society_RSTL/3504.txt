This is continually counteracted to some extent by
the addition of fresh material and nuclei ; but notwithstanding this, the size of the
fibre continues for a time to decrease, s0 that the diameter of a muscular fibre at birth
is considerably less than it was during a much earlier period of its existence *. That this decrease in the size of the fibre is due to a condensation of its s1bstance,
and not to stretching or any like cause, seems proved, â€”l1st, by the relative position
of the nuclei, for the decrease in breadth is not accompanied by a corresponding sepa-
ration of the nuclei ; and 2ndly, by the fact, that as the fibre decreases it becomes
much less transparent. The nuclei in its interior grow much more obscure, and they
are at length concealed by the increasing density of the muscular substance. At the time of birth muscuJar fibres present considerable variety in size and other
characters.
