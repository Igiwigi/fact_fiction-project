Then the equation of the Hessian is
HU=0(a*+/* +2) —(1+2P)zyz=0;
and the equation of the Pippian in line coordinates (that is, the equation which expresses
that £r+1y+@=0 is a tangent of the curve) is
PU=—F+#*+2)+(—1+4P)aZ=0.
The equation of the Quippian in line coordinates is '
QU=(1—10P)(P+#*+£)—6F(5+4P)&Z=0;
and the values of the two invariants of the cubic form are
S=—I+0P,
T=1—20P—80P,
values which give identically,
T*—648=(1+8P)Y;
the last-mentioned function being in fact the discriminant.

4. Suppose now that (X, Y, Z) are the coordinates of the point E, and (X', Y', Z)
the coordinates of the point F ; then the equations which express that these points are
conjugate poles of the cubic, are

XX'+7(YZ' +Y'Z) =0,
YY'+{(ZX'+Z/X)=0,
Z7 +XY'+X'Y)=0;
