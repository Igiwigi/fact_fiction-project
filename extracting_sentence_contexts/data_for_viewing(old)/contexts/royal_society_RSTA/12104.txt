An upward current was next applied and the film allowed to thin with th
following results :

White 03) 2-5 4.) heii ae

It will be noticed that every time the film was disturbed the value of r fell, i.
the specific conductivity of the film was reduced more nearly to that of the liquid i
mass, nor was this merely due to the fact that the first effect of the currents was 1
every case to thicken the film, the value of 7 corresponding to a given thickness
always less in a more recently disturbed film. This is proved by comparing th
values of 7 corresponding to 320 .n. in groups (3) and (2), and those correspondit
to 388 p.m. in groups (5) and (2).

We take it that this is sufficient proof that though the phenomenon we %
studying depends on the thickness, it is not merely an explicit function of th
thickness of the film, i.e., is not due exclusively to a peculiar molecular constitu
depending on the thickness. If this were so, the molecular conditions peculiar to
particular thickness would be immediately re-established as soon as the film reg ain
that thickness after disturbance.
