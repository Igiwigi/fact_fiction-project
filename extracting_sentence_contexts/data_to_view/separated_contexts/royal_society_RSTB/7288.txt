Armeria, Artemisia, Botrychium, Empetrum, Helianthemum, Selaginella and
Thalictrum. Another species of similar but less pronounced significance is Myriophyllum
alterniflorum; since anther clusters of this plant were also identified it is not surprising that
in the lower muds which represent the open-water phase of the channel’s history, very
large percentages of its highly recognizable pollen should have been encountered. (iii) There are present pollen grains of species which, although not yet generally recog-
nized as typical of the late-Glacial vegetation, have in fact been found in late-Glacial
deposits elsewhere in Britain (particularly in unpublished counts from the Lea Valley,
Essex-Hertfordshire). These include a single grain of the readily identifiable genus Pole-

Valeriana. In addition, we should mention the grains referred to as ‘cf.
