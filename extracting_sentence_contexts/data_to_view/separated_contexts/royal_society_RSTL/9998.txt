This group, which was formerly placed amongst the Tabulata, was probably
very rich in genera and species in palzozoic times, but it is gradually becoming extinct. Tn another direction arose the modern genus Alcyonium and its numerous allies. This genus differs from the ancestral form @ chiefly in the fact that the polyps are
capable of being retracted within the sarcosoma, but in other respects is probably
more closely related to ib than any other genera. The fact that the polyps are
capable of being retracted is not one of very great importance, for we find both in
this family and in the Gorgonide, that nearly allied genera differ frora one another
in this respect. The dimorphic genus, Sarcophyton, is probably closely related to
Aleyonium.
