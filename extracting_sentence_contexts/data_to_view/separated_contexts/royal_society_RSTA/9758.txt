There seems to be a considerable
seasonal variation in #, in H and I, but ¢, is so small in some winter months that
more than usual uncertainty attaches to the values for «, at this season. The
difference between the arithmetic mean and yearly inequality values for c; and ¢, is
more conspicuous, and probably reflects uncertainty in the monthly data rather than
true seasonal variability in the phase angles. There is, in fact, indication of but a
small seasonal variation in the values obtained for a and a, in the case of H. The values obtained for ¢, and c, in V from the smaller number of more highly
disturbed days are much larger than those derived from all the disturbed days. There is, however, no such enhancement in the winter value of ¢, in H, and the
results for c; and ¢, are in this respect somewhat conflicting in all the elements.
