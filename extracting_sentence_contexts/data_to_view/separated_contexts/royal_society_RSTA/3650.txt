Next, we turn to B(r) = on |8;Wosel do =h? Y(KN)~7[8,(A()rm[lek —rh-/?})P. From now
on we will repeatedly use the fact that, due to the support condition on m, we have m[/Pk —
rh-/7] 40 only for at most h~ values of k, and kN > (r/h). Owing to this, and also as |A’| $ ni,
we see that |B(r)| < heh (r/h)-2(h-V/2)2 Sh, where the last h-\/2 comes from the derivative in r. Hence in the wrinkled region |B(r)| < and B =0 otherwise, and so {5° (o),B(r) + B(r)?)rdr Sh.
