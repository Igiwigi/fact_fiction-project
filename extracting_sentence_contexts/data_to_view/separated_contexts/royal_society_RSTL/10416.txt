But, with the deficient supply of potass, there is deficient stem-formation
and immaturity ; in fact, deficient produce ; in other words, deficient carbon-assimila-
tion. Nor did the increased supply of soda compensate for the deficiency of potass,
80 far as these characters of growth are concerned. From the various facts adduced, it is evident that it was the want of a liberal
available supply of potass that restricted the growth on plot 4-2, with the ammonia-
salts and superphosphate of lime, and on plot 10 with the ammonia-salts, snper-
phosphate of lime, and a liberal supply of soda and magnesia, but only a partial one
of potass ; indeed, the agricultural, the botanical, and so far the chemical results,
concur in showing how essential is a liberal provision of potass for the full effect of
the nitrogen which was at the same time supplied. The comparison of the results
obtained on plots 7 and 8, the one with the mixed mineral manure each year, including
potass, and the other with the potass discontinued after the firs few years (as on
plot 10), but in both these cases without ammonia or other artificial nitrogenous
supply, showed that, under those conditions also, the potass was the most essential
to the growth among the mineral constituents supplied. But, whilst when the potass
was used in conjunction with ammonia, its effect was greatly to develop the Graminez,
and practically to exclude the Leguminosw, it was, when used without ammonia, very
characteristically to increase the Leguminosz, and very much less the Graminee than
when the ammonia was also applied.
