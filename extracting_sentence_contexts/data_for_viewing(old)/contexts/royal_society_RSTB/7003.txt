286 J. E. SMITH ON THE MECHANICS AND INNERVATION

In Astropecten the ampulla and tube-foot musculature are quite distinct. The former
(figure 4A) consists of a series of rings, each ring a single smooth muscle fibre. In the
ampulla neck (nck.) the bands are set horizontally, but in the ampulla itself the rings of
muscle are vertical and lie parallel to the long axis of the arm. The individual fibres of the
investing connective tissue sheath, on the other hand, run at right angles to the muscles;
in this respect they are orientated in a manner similar to the internal fibres of the retention
sheath of the podium (vide infra, p. 288).

The ampulla of Asterias rubens (figure 4B, amp.) is a spherical sac. Apart from the fact
that the muscles in its neck have a rather different arrangement from the similarly situated
ones in Astropecten the general disposition of both muscle and connective tissue fibres is
much the same in the two forms.

It is not known whether the possession of a simple or of a bilobed ampulla has any
functional significance. Taking the class of the Asteroidea as a whole and adopting the
classification of Mortensen (1927), it appears that. the bilobed type is the more common and
that while both forms may occur in any one family only one kind will be found within the
limits of a single genus.
