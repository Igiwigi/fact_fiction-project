bulk of the domain. This broadening process manifests itself in the vertical portion of the branch
(see E in figure 13), whose location (i.e. the Maxwell point) can be found by computing the value
of the parameter a for the formation of a heteroclinic connection between the BS and UV* states. That such a connection is likely is a consequence of the fact that the unstable manifold of BS
and the stable manifold of UV*+ are both two-dimensional at this value of a [28]. Since the stable
eigenvalues of UV* are in fact complex (figure 1), we expect an oscillatory approach to UVt
(responsible for the overshoot at the top right corner of the branch in figure 13) but monotonic
growth away from BS. So the presence of large amplitude oscillations away from and then back
to BS is unexpected.
