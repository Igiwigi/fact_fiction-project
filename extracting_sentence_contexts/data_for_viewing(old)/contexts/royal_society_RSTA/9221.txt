tables of old functions necessary to carry this out.t Diagrams like that accom-
panying this memoir, enable the statistician who has calculated the characteristic 8;
and £,, to select at once the appropriate type, from the position of the point £,, 8, in
the fi, 8, plane. The first diagram, prepared by Mr. A. J. Rutyp at my suggestion,
has been long in use.{ For the present very carefully prepared and much extended
diagram I have to thank my colleague, Miss ADELAIDE G. Davin, whose labours cannot
fail to be appreciated by those having to handle practically statistical data.

Since the publication of my original memoir on skew variation, many attempts have
“been made to express the nature of skew distributions by other systems of curves or
by expansions in series. I have given careful attention to these competing systems
and have discussed some of them elsewhere (‘ Biometrika,’ vol. IV., pp. 169 to 212).
My chief objections to them arise from the fact that they either (i.) cover far less
than the necessary area; or (ii.) involve constants the probable errors of which can be
indefinitely great ; or (ili.) involve constants the probable errors of which have not
been or possibly cannot be calculated. In no case that I know of have they syste-
matically been applied to extensive ranges of data, and the goodness of fit compared
with that of other systems. The existence of such competing systems is at any rate
