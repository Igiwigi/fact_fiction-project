is not likely to be disputed, for it is based on measurements within the same technique.
The leptotene elongation, on the other hand, is far more difficult to prove conclusively.
The chief evidence for it has two serious disadvantages. The fact that only one chromo-
some has been measurable at leptotene has been felt so acutely that publication of this
manuscript has been deferred for six months in the unfulfilled hope of a repetition.
A further difficulty is in the technique used. Acetic acid has the peculiar property of
practically doubling chromosome sizes at all stages. Is it not possible that the apparent
extension at leptotene may really be an artefact? While this possibility cannot be
denied, there is, nevertheless, no direct evidence to support it. In spite of the actual
enlargement the general relations of the relative lengths at all other stages (see Table II)
are still comparable with those obtained in the other techniques. It therefore seems
unnecessary to assume that the effect will suddenly be different at leptotene.
