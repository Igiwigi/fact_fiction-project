scales. In assessing the viability of the MBL state in higher dimensions, we do not claim that
the scaling argument is definitive on its own, but when employed in a length-scale induction
and buttressed by further analysis it deserves to be considered the ‘default’ prediction, barring
convincing evidence to the contrary.


In general, when conditions for resonant tunnelling are satisfied, one should expect that all the
configurations reachable by resonant transitions should be represented approximately equally
in the eigenfunctions. Thus, this picture predicts a sort of ‘thin ergodicity’ out to a distance at
least r(L), meaning that all configurations within an energy window (whose width decreases
exponentially with r) should be roughly equally represented in the eigenfunctions.

In fact, larger neighbourhoods of the Griffiths region should be affected similarly, with ‘thin
ergodicity’ extending to arbitrarily large radii, in the idealized case of a single Griffiths bubble
in the whole of Z4. To see this, we need a bootstrap (or inductive) argument. To match up the
transition energy to the requisite accuracy for a spin at a large distance r from the bubble, we need
sufficient ‘digits of precision’ to represent the energy difference. Thus, in order to find a transition
that resonates with the distant spin, we need to enlist a comparable number (O(r| log y|)) of spins
in the vicinity of the bubble. We may choose to organize the induction by considering whether
thin ergodicity out to a distance r/2 from the bubble will thermalize spins out to a distance r. : =
Repeating the calculation in (3.4) with N > N(r/2) = 200/ ayn /? (to account for the thinness of the 38
percolation cluster), we obtain the condition :
