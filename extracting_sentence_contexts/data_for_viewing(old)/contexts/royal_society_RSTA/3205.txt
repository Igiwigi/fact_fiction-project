comprehensive effective field theory expansion about the SM (and General Relativity) seems
formidable, and many have been constrained [17]. The fact that none of them seems necessary
to describe our observations of Nature makes us believe that there is something fundamental
about Lorentz invariance. Lorentz invariance is also at the basis of General Relativity. However,
this great degree of symmetry is a big obstacle to build a perturbative quantum field theory of
gravity in four dimensions. A concrete idea improving the quantum properties of gravity in four
dimensions by relaxing Lorentz invariance is Hofava gravity [18-21]. Lorentz invariance can be
broken fundamentally or spontaneously [22]. The challenge is to explain why the SM satisfies
Lorentz invariance to such a high accuracy if it is not a fundamental symmetry. There are ideas in
this direction, but no completely satisfactory mechanism is known [16]. If Lorentz invariance is
not satisfied, CPT can be violated in unitary theories. This may be important if one wants to find
theories where matter and antimatter have different properties.
Finally, the equivalence principle, the fact that all interactions of the SM fields with charges
related to the energy-momentum tensor are universal, is a foundational assumption of General
Relativity. It is tested to hold to a high accuracy [24]. But it is easily violated in extensions of
General Relativity with extra fields, so there are no fundamental reasons to consider it as sacred.

3. Tests with individual particles

With the previous remarks in mind, one can move on to develop modifications of the SM that alter
the way matter and antimatter interact with each other. It is highly desirable to do it in ways that
allow one to construct a complete theory. By this I mean theories where the points discussed in

1In fact, it seems that it can be violated in non-local Lorentz invariant theories [23], but I do not know how to make sense of
these theories.
