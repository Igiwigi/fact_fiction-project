The various appearances of this nebula are $0 instructive,
that I shall apply them to the subject of the partial opacity of. the nebulous matter, which has already been inferred from its
planetary appearance, when extremely condensed in globular
masses ; but which now may be supported by more direct
arguments. For when I formerly saw three fictitious nebulous,
Stars, it will not be contended that there were three small
$hining nebulosities, just in the three lines in which I saw them,.
of which two are now gone and only one remaining. As well. might we ascribe the light surrounding a star, which is seen
through a mist, to a quality of shining belonging to that
particular part of the mist, which by chance happened to be
situated where the star is seen.
