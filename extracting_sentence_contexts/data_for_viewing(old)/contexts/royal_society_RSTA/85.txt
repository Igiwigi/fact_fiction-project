simplifying the effect of all the other individuals on any given individual by a single averaged


effect. This results in considering the evolution of the particle density distribution in the state
variables, leading to so-called mean-field partial differential equations of Vlasov- or Boltzmann-
type [7]. In particular, for our system (1.1), the corresponding mean-field equations are

Om +v-Vye= Vy - (A * pw).

We refer to [8] and the references therein for a recent survey on some of the most relevant
mathematical aspects on this approach to swarm models. Nevertheless, the proper definition of a
limit dynamics when an external control is added to the system, and it is supposed to have some
sparsity surprisingly remains a difficult task. In fact, the most immediate and perhaps natural
approach would be to assign as well to the finite-dimensional control u an atomic vector-valued
time-dependent measure

N
vy () = > Uj8(x,(t),v(t)

i=l
and consider a proper limit v for N + +00, leading to the controlled PDE
+0 View = Vy - (A * we + vd, (1.4)

where now v represents an external source field. Unfortunately, despite the fact that vy are
supposed to be the minimizers of certain cost functionals which may allow for the necessary
