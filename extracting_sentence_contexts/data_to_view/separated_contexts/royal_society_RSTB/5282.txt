The inference is that
the same river, in common with lesser streams farther W., had now approached nearer
its base level, and was bringing mud where formerly it brought sand and pebbles—the
natural cycle of all rivers, the effects of which are so often displayed in the so-called
“ Tripartite Series” of the English Jurassic. If we have rightly interpreted the North Hinksey section as denoting the edge of the
area formerly occupied by the Littlemore Clay Beds (where coral growth was not quite
extinguished), then the course of the river through the coral islands to the open sea
probably lay northwards, between the hills of Wytham and Elsfield. The path of the
old river, in fact, coimcided with that of the Thames, but stoped in the opposite direction. This may be more than mere coincidence. ‘Tertiary denudation would have lowered
the clays to a greater extent than the surrounding limestones, and a weak spot would
have been prepared, providing the easiest southward passage for the Thames.
