35+ =97 nearly. The resistance of 3 ohms was then removed, and similar

observations gave 58 as the balancing-point. Immediately afterwards, the 3 ohms

resistance having been again introduced, the point appeared to be 56. The true

* Tt may be perhaps as well to state here that when small resistances were being compared, 10 ohms
instead of 100 ohms were generally employed, though this fact has not been always mentioned.

at as the means of several trials ;â€”
