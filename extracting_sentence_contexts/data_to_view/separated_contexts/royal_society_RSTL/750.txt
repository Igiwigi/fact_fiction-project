perchloride. of phosphorus, appear to me
still more /exceptionable; yet his results on the quantity of
oxygen approach nearer to mine than those of M. DuLons. The' facts which 1 endeavoured to. establish respecting
chlorine, in a paper published in the Philosophical Transac-


322 Sir H. Davy's new experiments on some

tions for 1810, show that the proportional or equivalent
volume in which chlorine combines, is to that in which oxygen
combines, as 2 to 1; and it follows, that 10 grains of phog-
phorus in forming the white sublimate, or perchloride, ought to
combine with between 76 and 80 cubical inches of chlorine: In experiments that I formerly made on this subject, by
admitting chlorine to phosphorus in exhausted vessels, and
ascertaining the absorption by introducing solution of chlorine,
I overrated the absorption.
