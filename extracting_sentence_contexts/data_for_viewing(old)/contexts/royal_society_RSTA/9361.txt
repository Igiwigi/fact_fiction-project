grains, and the process of yield will be propagated with great rapidity. At any given
moment there will be a considerable variation in stress in the regular lattice from grain
to grain. It will be small in a crystal which has just slipped. It will be large in one
which is on the point of slipping. Intermediate values will be found in erystals in
which slip has taken place at some previous instant, and in which the continued strain
is renewing the process of elastic deformation, which will gradually increase until fresh
dislocations occur. The whole process is consistent with a reduced external load, or
average stress, and will probably continue until the dislocations and slip planes are
sufficient in number to restrict to some extent the freedom of the intervening atomic
structure, when the yielding process will end, and a rising stress will accompany further
strain.

The fact that after removal and re-application of load during the yielding process
flow again takes place at the lower yield stress (fig. 6) may readily be explained on this
view. Removal of load will be accompanied by removal of the elastic deformation,
or even reversal in the case of grains carrying little stress at the moment of removal.
The displacements due to slip will be unaffected except possibly for small adjustments
that may take place. Re-application of load will simply restore the pre-existing elastic
strain, and crystals which were then on the point of failing will again be in the same state.

As to the magnitude of the stress reduction which, according to the view here put
forward, may accompany the dislocation within an individual grain, nothing definite
can be stated. There are some grounds for supposing that the stress may even be
reduced to zero. The fact, for instance, that when the external load is reversed plastic
flow may, as shown by Roperrson, commence at zero load, would suggest that this
