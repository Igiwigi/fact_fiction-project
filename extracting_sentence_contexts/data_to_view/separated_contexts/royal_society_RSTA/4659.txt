In this regard, one
can mention the paper of Blank [9] where he proves existence of solutions to the obstacle problem
with a free boundary that spirals around a point. The construction of I. Blank depends heavily on
the fact that the Ag is non-Dini. As mentioned earlier, having settled the optimal C!!-regularity of the solution, one can
consider the equation

Au=(A@)x{u=y) in By,

which can be written as
Av=(â€”Ag)xv>0) in Bi,
with v=uâ€” 9g.

(c) Non-degeneracy

The concavity of y, or more precisely the strict positivity of â€”Ag, at free boundary points of
interest, becomes of central importance, in order to have the so-called non-degeneracy. That is,
we would like to have that the supremum value of v around the free boundary point behaves
quadratically with respect to the distance to the free boundary,
supv> cr, (2.2)
B-@)
where z is now a free boundary point, and â€”Ag(z) > 1 (say).
