M4&ntaaux, it should be noted, regards the blood as passing
down one principal filament and back by the next, the principal filaments of each
lamella being thus alternately afferent and efferent (62, p. 175. Solen and some
other forms), and Jonnstone (40, fig. 26) in his investigations of Cardiuwm has
arrived at the same conclusion. What it is important to note in this connection is the fact that principal filamentsâ€™
are ontogenetically a secondary differentiation. No genus could be better adapted
for an investigation of this point than Pecten, since in this genus there is a remark-
ably strong contrast in size between the principal and ordinary filaments. In
*Pecten irradians Jackson has described (38, p. 836) a stage in which the filaments
are fully reflected, and yet the interlamellar septa which, he remarks, occur on every
eleventh to fifteenth filament of the adult gill, are not developed; and (judging by
his figure, Plate 28, fig.
