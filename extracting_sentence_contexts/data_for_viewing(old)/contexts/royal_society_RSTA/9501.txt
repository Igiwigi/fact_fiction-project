ments of the magnetograph were usually made in that month leading to special
uncertainties in the n.c. changes.

Diurnal Inequalities.

§5. The diurnal inequality of a magnetic element is in continuous variation with
the season of the year; it also varies according to the development of sunspots, and
it depends on the more or less disturbed character of the day. There are most likely
other causes of variation ; for instance, it seems unlikely that the diurnal variation at

3a particular station remains wholly unaffected by the secular change in the earth’s
a magnetism. In deciding on the amount of detail advisable in the presentation of the
8 facts, several conflicting considerations have to be allowed for. There is a great deal
g which in the present state of our knowledge must be regarded as accidental in the
magnetic changes on any individual day. If we derive inequalities from the combi-
2 nation of a very limited number of days, a good deal of this “accidental” element will
S remain uneliminated. If, on the other hand, we combine a large number of days from
Pthe same year, the inequality is inevitably a blend of more or less conflicting
sbcharacteristics. The extent to which this is the case differs at different seasons of the
a year. There is, for instance, much greater variation in the type and amplitude of the
3 diurnal inequality in the five months November to March than in the five months
5 apr il to August. If we have at our disposal the data from a large number of years,
3 we can get smooth diurnal inequalities for individual seasons of the year a good deal
rg shorter than a calendar month. This is what we should naturally do if our object
& were to examine in very minute detail the mode of variation of the diurnal inequality
