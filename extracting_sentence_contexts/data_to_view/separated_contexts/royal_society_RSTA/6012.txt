Thus one advantage of the variable ) now becomes apparent: it is the self-similarity
parameter in situations where the leading-order approximation is good enough. If K- is regarded
as a function of v rather than j, the maximum is still 1//2, but the relevant range becomes |v| <
e/V12. The fact that K’,, =0 at 5 =0, or equivalently at v = 0, is used in later series expansions. For plotting, we use instead of (3.2), the alternative form

K, =K¢(6,€) = Keo(d) + €Ker() + €7Ke2(8) +... (3.6)
where
(K2)1 (K2).  {(K2)1}? K d K, - pees 3.7
1 = OK an = 3K BK, (3.7)

Here, K-9 and K,2 are even, and K, is odd.
