ether on the bulb several times in the interval.

When the radiometer had once more acquired the temperature of the air, I dropped
ether on the bulb, not in cethe ntre, but s0 that the ether wetted only half of the bulb.
The arm which was nearest to the part most wetted by the ether rushed towards that
part and remained, as it were, fixed opposite to it, refusing to move away, although I
tried to equalize the temperature by dropping ether on the other parts of the bulb, and
to drive it round by bringing a candle near. Not until the candle came within 6 inches
of the bulb did the arms begin to rotate, which they then did with a rush, as if
suddenly relieved from a state of tension.

170. These results appear at first 8ight anomalous. TI think, however, they admit of
an explanation which is in keeping with the facts, if T may make one supposition.
The great difference between a lampblacked and a white surface is only an optical
one. Pith reflects a considerable amount of light, and lampblack absorbs a large
quantity of light, but it is unsafe to carry the analogy into the ultra-red region of
the spectrum. We know of many white powders, optically identical, which in their
thermic relations are as wide apart as pith and lampblack (e. g. powdered alum and
