As far as we have examined, for any
y €[0,27/K) with K=3 and any 3S M<10, 3-aligned/staggered M-rings are always vortex
crystals whose corresponding configuration matrix has a one-dimensional null space. We thus
normalize the right eigenvector to the zero eigenvalue in the same manner as (3.2) in §3a to
obtain the strengths, which is denoted by Ij,,(y) for the mth-point vortex on the kth M-ring. As a matter of fact, we find that M-point vortices on the same line of latitude (M-ring) have the
same strength. In other words, I,m(y) is independent of m. Hence, we observe the representative
strength ily) = Im(y) for the kth vortex ring in what follows.
