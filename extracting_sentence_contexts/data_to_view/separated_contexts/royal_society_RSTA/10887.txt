The fact that
quiet” days was barely
40 per cent, of that for “all” days prepares one for a material difference between the
phenomena in the two cases, but hardly for the “all” day mean yearly value of }
being more than six times the corresponding “quiet” day value. The “quiet” day
value of a for summer is not much less than the “all” day value, but in the

‘c

the mean diurnal range during the 11-year period for the

equinoctial and winter months the latter greatly predominates. The value of b is
greatest at the equinox in both “all” and “quiet” days; in fact, in “all” days the
summer value of ) falls short of the winter value, notwithstanding a marked
depression in December and January. The variation of b/a throughout the year on
“quiet” days is somewhat irregular. In “all” days we have the fall in summer and
rise in winter seen at Kew, but there is a prominent depression in December and
January.
