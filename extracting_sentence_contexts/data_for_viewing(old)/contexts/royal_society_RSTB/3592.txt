generally assumed that all Cycads have transfusion tissue. We examined the case
of Bowenia carefully, and noted that the whole leaf is little differentiated and appears
to consist of rather thin-walled cells. The lack of specialised tranfusion tissue in
Bowenia may be correlated with the undifferentiated character of the whole leaf,
which, consisting almost entirely of soft parenchyma, would facilitate the transmission
of water in any direction. Microcycas, on the other hand, which is quite xerophytic
in its organisation, though having an actual space between its veins only one-
third of that between the veins of Bowenia, yet has the longest and most differentiated
transfusion cells of any we measured. It is possible, therefore, that the absence of
transfusion tissue in the fossils may be considered a specific character, as in the case of
Bowenia ; but as they are so much more like the xerophytic Microcycas in their
organisation, it seems very probable that it depended on the closeness of the veins,
which made the system of conducting tissue more efficient. It remains a fact that
the closeness of the veins in Cycadeoidea and Niponophyllum (to a less extent),
makes it a physical impossibility for such elongated cells as the true Cycadean
transfusion tissue to be present between the bundl√©s, while the closeness of the veins
may remove the physiological necessity for them.

In conclusion, Zamiophyllum seems to lie somewhere between Cordaites and

* The veining of Monocotyledons is more comparable, as it is parallel, and in them there is a fine
cross network of veins between the main ones, which makes the conducting system efficient. Note by
