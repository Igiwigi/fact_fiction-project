In the sub-thalamic region large degenerate fibres
group themselves into a commissure, which passes in front of the ventricle and proceeds to the
opposite side, where it loses itself in the internal capsule close to the cortex.

gap between this upper decussation of ForeL and the lower one, scattered degenerate:
decussating fibres binding the two together. I therefore conclude that these fibres
are homologous to the arcuate fibres of lower segments. They take origin at a
slightly higher level than the fibres of the lower decussation, but it is a very striking
fact that they then gradually ascend to their termination, There is, in fact, a fan-
shaped system of decussating fibres, which arises in the tegmentum, extending the
length of the superior corpus quadrigeminum and lower part of the thalamus; from
this basis the fibres spread out slightly upwards and downwards, the latter turning

directly downwards after they have passed out a certain distance. From this region
in the mesencephalon the degeneration is centrifugal.
