Figure 3. (a) The Fourier spectrum of the additive data: a simple superposition of the individual spectra from the sine and the
white noise (the green dashed line for the sine wave, blue dotted line for noise and red solid line the sum). (b) The Fourier
spectrum of the multiplicative data: the original sine wave disappeared; the overall product energy density actually decreases
(the green dashed line for the sine wave, blue dotted line for noise and red solid line for the product; the energy density will
increase if the sine wave amplitude is much larger than 1). The two-term case is somewhat ambiguous and not easy to see. This additive-multiplicative
ambiguity is hard to resolve until we consider a case with three or more wave multiplications, for
example:

x(f) = cos A cos B cos C

(2.4)

~ 4} +cos(A —B+C) +cos(A — B—C)

_l cos(A + B+ C) + cos(A + B— C)
In fact, it can be shown that n product terms will end with the sum of 2) waves. All the additive
terms will congregate near the highest frequency component. This shifting of energy density to
high frequency not only is uninformative, but also makes the spectral energy density inextricably
mixed with noise and harmonics.
