Taking the results as summarized by the PDG (pdg.lbl.gov), in figure 6b the best-fit result and
the upper limit on the Higgs mass are displayed as they developed over the years. Very clearly,
these analyses predicted the existence of a Higgs boson with mass not much larger than the
direct lower limit obtained at LEP, assuming the validity of the SM. The fact that the recently
discovered Higgs boson turned out to have a mass consistent with these indirect constraints
again represents a triumph for the SM as a field theory, which correctly describes our available
measurements of elementary particle properties. It should be mentioned that a plethora of similar
indirect constraints and predictions was produced over the years, by typically extending the
overall theoretical context beyond the SM; for example, carrying out such a programme of fitting
in the context of a supersymmetric extension of the SM. An impressive compilation of more than
100 indirect Higgs mass predictions can be found in [33].
