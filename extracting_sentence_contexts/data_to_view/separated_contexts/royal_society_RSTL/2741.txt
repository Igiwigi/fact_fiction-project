26. In these tables the differences of heights are arranged according as the tide oc-
Ccurs A.M. or P.M. But it will be seen at once that this is not, in fact, the circumstance
on which the distinction depends; for at most of the places the p.y. tides are greatest
till about the 12th, then the a.v. tides are the greatest till the 18th, and afterwards
the e.. tides are again the highest. Hence we see that it is impossible to give the
law of this inequality, as is sometimes attempted, by saying that at one season of the
year the A.M. tides are greatest, and at another season the p.m. tides are greatest. 'The
real rule, on the coast of America, is, that the tide which follows the superior transit
of the moon when she has south declination, and the inferior transit when she has
north declination, is the greatest.
