The work to be deseribed in this paper proceeds on the same general lines. A large part of it deals with a branch of the subject which has not hitherto received
much notice, namely, the effects of strain. The writers believe that they have
established the fact that the structure of metals is crystalline even under conditions
which might be supposed to destroy crystalline structure. They have found that the
plastic yielding of metals when severely strained occurs in such a manner that the
crystalline structure is preserved, The observations to be described show how
crystalline aggregates exhibit plasticity, and how, after straining, a metal continues
to be a crystalline aggregate. The distinction which is often drawn between crystal-
line and non-crystalline states in metals appears to be unfounded.
