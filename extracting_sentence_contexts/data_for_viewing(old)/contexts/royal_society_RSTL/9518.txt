which is

=4(a, h, lym +a, n+B)*+4nmi(m+a.u+y.+.n+P.v+0)
+ other terms which are as follows : viz., they are

—J(a, h, blYm+a, n+PBLz, 4) +4(m+a.ac+hy.+.n+B.hex+by)

+1(a, h, bYz, y)? —4Ti(z.u+y. +.y.v+8)

—L(z.ax+hy. +.y.ha+by),

where the terms of the right hand column are in fact

=—+14(a, h, bXYm +a, n+PBLz, y)
. —LJmri(z.u+y.+.y.v+8)
—hL(a, h, bYwz, YYP,


AND DOUBLE THETA-FUNCTIONS. 903

and the other terms in question thus reduce themselves to

—L1a, h, bY, y)? —JTi(z.u+y.+.y.v+8),
