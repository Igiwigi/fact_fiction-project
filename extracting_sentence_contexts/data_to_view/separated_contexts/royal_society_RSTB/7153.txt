As a result two
groups of factors have had to be kept in mind, namely, immunological factors concerned
with the behaviour of homotransplants in general and endocrinological factors concerned
with the behaviour of transplants of endocrine tissue, whether auto-transplants or
homo-transplants. In planning new experiments it has been considered desirable to take account of the
literature relating to the transplantation of embryonic and neoplastic as well as normal
tissues. The relevant facts which have so far been established may be summarized as
follows:

1. Autotransplants

Autotransplants (i.e. transplants to a new site in the same individual) of a wide variety
of tissues commonly survive, and in many instances function. Jaffe & Plavska (1926) obtained functioning subfascial autotransplants of suprarenal
cortical tissue in rats and guinea-pigs, Loeb (1930) demonstrated that autotransplants of

thyroid and other tissues would survive in various situations, and Sochet (1929) found that
autotransplants of guinea-pig endometrium made to the anterior chamber of the eye
survived indefinitely and showed typical oestrus changes.
