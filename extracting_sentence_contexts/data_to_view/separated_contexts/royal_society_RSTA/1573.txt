But that residue
will also be hot, and have to cool, which takes time. It will also subside as it does so, as illustrated
in the cartoon in figure 9. The thick underlying mantle lithosphere will itself have a long thermal
time constant, reminiscent of the long subsidence history of these basins, but in fact the effects are
more subtle, and were investigated by McKenzie & Rodriguez Tribaldos [94], using the Parnaiba
basin in Brazil as an example (figure 9). In the sequence of events shown in the cartoon, there
are three times that matter: (i) When the thickening occurred, because the heating is affected
by the “°K and 75U content, and both were more abundant in earlier Earth history; (ii) how
long the crust remained thick, which determines the degree of heating and (iii) how quickly the
upper crust is removed. In particular, it is the erosion of the topography at faster than the thermal
timescale of the lithosphere that produces the observed rapid initial subsidence.
