The angle A, is positive when the fins are inclined so as to impose clockwise rotation
when viewed from the rear. When the fins are not offset A, = 0, so that I’, vanishes. If the fins are not too small, nearly all the damping couple is due to the fact that, because
of the lateral velocity pr of each part of the fins, the true angle of incidence (downwash being

neglected) is not A, but hel aes (358-5)
by Assumption Al. At the centre of pressure of a fin this is

Ap—4apr/V. Hence in this case we have T,a=T paz, (3-53-6)

approximately.
