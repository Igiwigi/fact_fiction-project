The explanation appears to be as follows. If the source which
produces an image on the retina, subtends so small an angle, and is of such feeble
illumination that it stimulates only one receptor, then the latter responds with a colourless
sensation, because the angle and intensity are such as to cause colourless foveal vision under
the action of the antichromatic responses. If, on the other hand, the visual angle and
intensity are such as to cause the recognition of colour, then several receptors are stimu-
lated, some of one response, some of another, and the fact that the stimulus is a colourless
one is at once recognized. Thus the test object remains white almost all the time. Occasion-
ally, however, the image falls on receptors with the same response, when the colour sensa-
tion proper to those receptors is momentarily appreciated.
