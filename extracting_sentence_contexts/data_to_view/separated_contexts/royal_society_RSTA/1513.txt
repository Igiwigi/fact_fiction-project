Although, therefore, the large number of significant figures used in these equations
results from a series of fine adjustments, and might be reduced by a laborious process
of readjustment of all the constants simultaneously, we believe that the location of
the two characteristic wave-lengths 2, and 2, at 1130 and 310 A.U., respectively, is
substantially correct. Since the characteristic wave-lengths thus deduced are much
more precise than any of the values that have been available hitherto, we have been
able to reverse Drupr’s procedure to the extent of deriving from the rotations an
equation for the refractive dispersion of quartz, which agrees in an exemplary manner
with the very exact data of Grrrorp* for the refractive indices of the ordinary ray in
the visible and ultra-violet regions, and which shows only small deviations in the infra-red
region down to 13070 A.U.

The method of deducing the dispersion-constants from the rotatory powers themselves,
instead of from cognate data, has also been vindicated in a dramatic manner by the
discovery} that the characteristic wave-lengths derived from the dispersion-constants
are generally greater by about 100 Angstrém units than those at which a maximum is
recorded in the molecular absorption coefficient of an organic compound. This dis-
crepancy is easily understood if the “selective absorption’ is superposed on a broad
band of “general absorption,” as is actually the case for many organic compounds ;
but the discovery of this discrepancy was due entirely to the fact that the dispersion-
constants were calculated before the absorption-coefficients had been determined,
instead of being deduced from them,

(d) Validity of Equations. (i) Photographic Region.—The proof of the complete validity of the equations which we
have used to express the rotatory dispersion of quartz depends on a demonstration that
there are no marked systematic differences between the observed and calculated rotations. These differences are summarised in the following table :—
