during the combustion of the explosives. If the explosive is concentrated in one part
only of the enclosure, the effect is increased and the pressure rises by sharp steps, as
shown in fig. 18. With some powders the sudden increments of pressure become

dangerously large and an abnormally high maximum is reached in one or two steps.
This phenomenon seems to be the transition between an explosion and a detonation.
That it is difficult, in fact almost impossible, to detonate cordite has long been
recognised as one of its principal advantages. Nevertheless, signs of abnormal
explosion were visible whenever the charge was crowded together in one part of the
enclosure. A fairly typical case is shown in fig. 4, Plate 21, a similar effect being
recorded in many other cases, notably F 68, F 69, and F 70 (Tables XI., XII., XIIT.).
The experiments in this direction had to be confined to pressures of about
1000 atmospheres. From these tests it seems probable that by working under similar
conditions, but with a higher gravimetric density, cordite would give results not
unlike those obtained by Viemie* in the case of “BF.” and other powders.

ViriLLEx, in the course of this work, obtained instantaneous pressures amounting to three times the normal
value. Using a method of calculation similar to that given below, he showed that the speed of propagation
