with its transmission on October 14, when the wind had the same strength and the
same direction, namely N.N.W. with a force of 2, My notes of the observations show
that the latter was throughout a day of extreme optical clearness. 'The range was 10
miles. On February 7 the *Argus' heard the sound at 11 miles; and it was also
heard through the densest fog at the Varne light-vessel, which is 124 miles from the
Foreland.

But this important circumstance is also to be borne in mind : on February 7 the syren
happened to be pointed not towards the © Argus,” but towards Dover. Had the yacht
been in the axis of the syren, it is highly probable that the sound might have been heard
all the way across to the coast of France.

The fact that Mr. TroucuToN was able through the fog to © locate” the Foreland, and
that his fixing of the direction should be subsequently found correct, is also one of
great importance.

Early in the morning of the 20th of February there was also a fog in the neighbour-
hood of the Scuth Foreland. It was a patchy fog, at intervals very thick and then
comparatively clear. 'The © Argus' steamed out at 8 A.M., and carried the sounds to a
distance of 10 miles along the axial line of the instruments. At that distance the
horn-s0unds were better than those of the syren, although at shorter distances the syren
had greatly excelled the horn. At the Varne light-ship (12% miles) the horn-sounds.
only had been heard during the fog. At the 10-miles position the atmosphere was
beautifully clear, the sun shining strongly, and the fog-bank lying over the land clearly
defined, extending seaward about 5 miles.
