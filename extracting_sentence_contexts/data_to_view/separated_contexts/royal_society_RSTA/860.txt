We note that changes in albedo are also found to have some non-negligible effect on hot extremes,
in particular for albedo increases of 0.1, consistent with other analyses [45,47]. Nonetheless, their
effect appears smaller than that of irrigation in the considered (idealized) experiment. An important feature also highlighted in Hirsch et al. [15] is the fact that the total effect of
irrigation or albedo on the regional temperatures is found to be almost independent of the level
of global warming (close to constant offset from the line for the CTL experiment; figure 9). This
