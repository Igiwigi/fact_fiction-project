DicryoxIPHium.

Herbarium material of D, panamense, Hx., shows that the sorus is mixed, and
there is no regularity of orientation of the sporangia.

Departa, Hook. and Grey.

This genus of Ferns has been recognised as having a near relation to Dennstcedtia,
from which they differ “mainly by their extramarginal sori” ;* indeed, D, concinna
was placed in Dennstadtia by Moorr, and is described as closely resembling
Dicksonia (Dennstedtia) adiantoides in habit. In this connection D, Moorei, Hx.,
is of special interest, since it bears not only the marginal stipitate sori characteristic
of the genus, but also superficial sori. This important fact, which was noted by
Moorsg,t has been verified on herbarium specimens at Kew and at Glasgow.

The sorus of D. Moorei shows sporangia of various ages intermixed and with no
definite orientation. The sporangia are of small size, and have long stalks, and a
head which is almost bilaterally symmetrical, the inequality of the two sides being
very slight (fig. 136).

Hypo errs.

It will be remembered that this genus was included by Kunn and by Prantrf in
the Dennsteedtine, though by other writers it has been placed in the Pteridex. It
is in eases such as this that new characters of the sorus may be used with effect in
