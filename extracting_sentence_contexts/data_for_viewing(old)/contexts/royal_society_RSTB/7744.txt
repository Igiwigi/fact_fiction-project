to Chalky Boulder Clay times. Over a north-east-south-west distance of 27 miles it appears
to remain horizontal. I suggested in the discussion to his paper that until the ground had
been geologically mapped, it might be difficult to separate erosion benches from residual
patches of lake deposits, but this criticism does not in any way weaken his case. The
correspondence of his conclusions and mine is striking, though the methods of approach

differ. ;
(c) The floor of Lake Harrison

The lake deposits which are so well developed in east Warwickshire and west Leicester-
shire are crossed by the main English watershed which is below the 400 ft. contour in
places, i.e. lower than the level of Lake Harrison, Even more significant, however, is the
fact that borings east of the Warwickshire coalfield have proved over 200 ft. of drift
(cf. figure 5, No. 3). It is obvious that the present-day watershed lies across the site of
a great pre-glacial hollow, and that the topography which assisted in the formation of
Lake Harrison must have been radically different from that of to-day.

Figure 11, is an attempt to reconstruct the topography of the Midlands immediately
before the period of the Second Welsh and Great Eastern glaciation. It is based solely
on several thousands of points where the level of the bottom of the older drifts can be
determined exactly or by estimation from maps. No account has been taken of present-
day topography nor of low-level valley deposits which clearly belong to a later erosional
cycle than the older drifts. To obtain information, I have used all the published maps
and memoirs and the six-inch field maps of the Geological Survey, the well records of
that organization, private papers, in particular those of Dr Tomlinson, and my own
