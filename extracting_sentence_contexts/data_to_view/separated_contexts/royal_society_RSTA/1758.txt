One ineffective strategy
involves emphasizing actuarial risk levels, with the hope that better understanding will generate
greater support for the technology [36,37]. Another cluster of strategies collectively comprise a
manifestation of the ‘engineer’s myth’ that a new design is accident-proof or sabotage-proof
[38]. The implicit message of these often well-intentioned strategies is that public anxiety is
unfounded and, if the strategy is executed by experts who are perceived as arrogant or dismissive,
public opposition may harden regardless of the facts [39]. For a review of the literature on public
perception of nuclear power, and for a summary of these strategies, please consult [40]. The lesson for fusion technologies is that the development of super-safe reactors is necessary
but not sufficient to gain the level of public acceptance required for mass deployment, since mass


deployment depends on how the public processes risk information and not just on actual risk
levels [40].
