in fact only at certain places is there any deep penetration into the tissues of the
mother after (in the sheep) disappearance of the uterine epithelium.

A comparison of the full term placenta in each ease shows the resemblance (figs. 2
and 8, Plate 13).

I take first the condition of the sheep. Here as represented diagrammatically in
fig, 2, Plate 13, we see the small chorionic villi which are to be found over the greater
part of the intercotyledonary areas, and which do not penetrate the epithelium, but
fit into depressions in the lining surface of the uterus.

At places, however, much longer greatly branched villi have penetrated the
uterine tissues after disappearance of the epithelium and fit closely into deep erypts.
