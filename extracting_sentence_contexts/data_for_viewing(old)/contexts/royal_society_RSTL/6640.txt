MR. HOPKINS ON THE THEORY OF THE MOTION OF GLACIERS. 709

I have proved that they must in all cases differ by an angle of 45*. IT have thought it
right to say thus much to vindicate my claim to having been the first to give any expla-
nation, founded on true mechanical principles, of the phenomena in question.

32, That the theoretical law above enunciated with respect to the directions of trans-
Verse Crevasses is the actual law, is determined, I conceive, beyond all doubt. It was,
in fact, 80 distinctly recognized by M. AGass1z and others*, before careful observations
had been made on glacial motion, that it was regarded as a proof that the sides of a
glacier moved faster than its central portion. But the best and, I believe, the only
accurate recorded evidence on the subject is that afforded by the admirable map
published by M. AGass1z, of the glacier of the Aar, There the crevasses, in a particular
locality, are laid down with geometrical accuracy, and the eye recognizes at once the
law in question, notwithstanding the minor deviations which must necessarily result in
8uch a case from local and irregular causesF. Principal ForBes, however, does not
8eem to recognize this law; for he observes} that he agrees with some preceding
observers in believing crevasses to be mere accidents of glacial motion. T have, however,
demonstrated, as I had done before the publication of the paper in which this opinion
is expressed, that though a glacier should be affected by no irregularities of surface Ã¾.
