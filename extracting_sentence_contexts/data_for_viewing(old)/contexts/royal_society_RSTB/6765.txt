E. A region from the opposite side, extending from the third to the sixth intersomitic
septum behind the wing bud.

The six explants of region C (fig. 20a, Plate 36) all formed a large fragment of the
sternal plate, a coracoid, usually part of the scapula and the proximal part of the
wing skeleton (humerus and fragments of the radius and ulna). Those of region D
(fig. 20b, Plate 36) formed a small flat plate of cartilage usually with a small spike
at one end similar to that of the explants of region A, group 1. This projection probably
represented one of the posterior lateral processes. Five of the six explants of region E
formed no cartilage (fig. 20c, Plate 36) but a small nodule developed in the sixth.

These results define the posterior border of the sternal tissue still more precisely.
The fact that one explant of region E developed a little cartilage whilst all those of
region D formed cartilage shows that the posterior boundary of the presumptive sternal
tissue lies near the third intersomitic septum behind the wing bud.

Conclusion. The posterior border of the presumptive sternal tissue is near the level
of the third intersomitic septum behind the wing bud.

Object of experiments. To find the anterior boundary of the presumptive sternal tissue
in the undifferentiated body wall.

Material and methods. Fragments of the body wall from 34-day fowl embryos were
