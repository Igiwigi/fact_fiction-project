thus the assimilation numbers for the first days are 65, 67, 71, 77, 63; they never
rise as high as 60 after the plant has been at the temperature of 29° C., although the
self-same temperatures are again tried. At the beginning also occur the greatest
oscillations in the curve, showing that the plant is there able to respond adequately,
as regards assimilation, to variations in temperature.

After the eighth day there is a change; the amounts of assimilation at 29° C.,
20° C., 11° C., 16° C., and 33° C., all have about the same value—indeed, they agree
among themselves far better than do readings of the same temperature at different
times, from which we again see the influence of the time-effect. Now come the
experiments at 33° C., which have been already mentioned, and which are the
prelude to a very rapid fall in the assimilation, The fact that subsequent
experiments were all at temperatures above 33° C. easily explains this, for the “ after-
effect” is greater the higher the temperature. The leaf was kept for 8 hours at
87° C., and for 8 hours at 42° C., but nevertheless was still considered to be in a
normal state for assimilation at 46° C.

As a finale to the series, the assimilation was again taken at 25° C. and found to
be 23°9, in contrast to the values of 65°7, 71 and 561 obtained before. This
enormous fall must indicate a very great diminution in the vitality of the leaf.
Kreusier, however, was quite content, because it was greater than the assimilation
at 46° C., and showed that the branch could still respond to the stimulus of change
of temperature. The four values obtained for the assimilation at 25° C., if plotted
out in their chronological order (as dotted in fig. 1), probably give a very fair
