equally confirmatory of my views regarding © cells” in general. The nucleus is very
distinctly seen to be composed of discs (figs. 154, 155, 156.), into which it divides ;
and at a certain part, there is s0metimes seen a highly refracting object, correspond-
ing apparently to the nucleolus of authors, but, as I believe, being really an orifice
communicating with the exterior of the cell.

175. I have already mentioned my inability to confirm the idea of Professor
Scnawann, who supposed it to be by elongation, that these pale cells form the fibres
of the lens. It is true he makes the addition, © I have several times observed the
arrangement, one upon another, of the nuclei of cells; hut do not know what it
indicates. It is also very possible that the coalescence of cells may take place to form
a fibre ; but hitherto I have no decisive observationsh.” It affords me satisfaction to
find that, while bringing forward facts opposed to the views of this excellent ob-
server, I am not without an admission—very important as coming from him—of the
possibility that the fibres may arise by another mode.

176, It remains to add, that the appearance now and then, in very large numbers,
and in parallel lines, of objects such as those in figs. 157, 158, 159, has led me to
believe that the fibre of the lens is formed by the coalescence of the cells in question,
previously arranged in a line.

177. These fibres in many instances originally present the nucleus in their cells
(see the figures). Sometimes the s0-called nucleolus—really an orifice—is also pre-
sent (figs. 157, 158. «), communicating with the exterior of the cell. In another in-
stance (fig. 157.3), I saw the cell filled with discs, there being no nucleus in this cell.
