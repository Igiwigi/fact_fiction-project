Andrewsii, they would have to be removed from the Ccenothecalia and P
among the Autothecalia, that is to say, they would be allies of Tubipora rather ¢
of Heliopora. But I am not satisfied that there is any such primitive independ,
of the corallites in Monticulipora, as is described by NicHorgon. As evidence
their independence he brings forward the structure of the corallum as shown in th
sections, and the results obtained by rough fractures, which, he says, invariably
expose the walls and not the interior of the tubes. i

Passing over the fact that too much importance cannot be attached to resul
obtained by such a very crude method of investigation as that of rough fracture,
wish to point out that the cleavage of any coral which is roughly broken m
correspond to the lines of least resistance, and will depend in each case rather on the
mineralization of the specimen than on the original structure of its corallum. I have,
for instance, before me a beautiful specimen of Favosites gothlandica from the Upper
Silurian of N. America, which has been kindly lent me by Professor A.
