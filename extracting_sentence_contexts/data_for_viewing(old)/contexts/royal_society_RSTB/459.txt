tion is wholly inoperative in respect to individual varieties of patterns, and unable to
exercise the slightest check upon their vagaries. Yet, for all that, the different
classes of patterns are isolated from one another, through the rarity of transitional
cases, just as thoroughly, and just in the same way, as are the genera of plants and
animals. There is no statistical difference between the form of the law of distribution
of individual patterns about their respective typical centres, and that of the law by
which, say, the Shrimps described in Mr. Wexpon’s recent memoir (‘ Roy. Soe. Proc.,’
vol. 47, p. 445) are distributed about theirs. In both cases the distribution is in quasi-
accordance with the theoretical law of Frequency of Error, and this form of distribution
is caused in the case of the patterns entirely by internal conditions, and in no way by
natural selection in the ordinary sense of that term.

It is impossible not to recognise the fact so clearly illustrated by these patterns in
the thumbs, that natural selection has no monopoly of influence in forming genera,
but that it could be wholly dispensed with, the internal conditions acting by them-
selves being amply sufficient to form them. When the internal conditions are in
harmony with the external ones, as they appear to be in all long-established races,
their joint effects will curb individual variability more tightly than either would do
by itself. The normal character of the distribution about the typical centre will not
be thereby interfered with. The probable divergence (= probable error) of an
individual taken at random will be lessened, and that is all.

Not only is it impossible to substantiate a claim for natural selection that it is the
sole agent in forming genera, but it seems, from the experience of artificial selection,
that it is scarcely competent to do so by favouring mere varieties, in the sense in
