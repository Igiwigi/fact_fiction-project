in the nitrogen eyolved in the feces by the three cases, which when reckoned as urea
— -amounted to 17:33 grs. There was no decrease in the quantity of urea on Sundays at
' this period by the third case, but, on the contrary, there was an increase of 52 grs —_
the average of all days. 'The loss of nitrogen in the urine was thus found in the feces,
The case which was allowed 63 0z. of extra bread per day had the largest amount of
feces on the average, and the largest increase of feces on Sundays. The total average
— excretion of feces was 73 per cent. greater than in myself, with an equal amount of food
and much more exertion.

The foregoing investigation has elicited the following facts.
& TL. The prisoners emitted much more urea and feces than occurs in health under
S ordinary cireumstances.
'» 2, On Sundays the amount of urea was commonly lessened, but the nitrogen in the
= feces was increased in the same proportion. The whole weight of feces was increased.
S 38. With treadwheel labour there was a small increase in the amonnt of urea and of
S urine eyolyed, whilst there was a 8mall decrease in the evolution of chloride of 8odium
= by the urine, the weight of the freces, and the nitrogen contained in the faeces. On
H Saturdays, with treadwheel labour the diminution in the feces and the contained nitrogen
S was considerable.
= 4. With increase in the allowance of bread there was a considerable increase in the
S weight of the feces, and particularly with rest.
