in inter-radius I/V separates the ray I structures from the ray V_ structures,
associating the former with those of ray II, a ray which certainly belongs to the
anterior portion of the series. These facts strengthen the evidence provided by the nine-rayed sun-star Solaster
endeca (29, pp. 28, 29). Here the four extra rays are developed one by one in order
from ray V onwards, so that we cannot but enumerate the series as beginning with
pouch I.
