Tl. Chromospheric nanoflares are not a primary source of coronal plasma

Heating is expected to occur at all heights in the solar atmosphere, including but not limited to the
corona. In fact, the heating requirements of the chromosphere are much larger than those of the
corona [29]. This suggests the interesting possibility that coronal plasma comes not from heating
in the corona but from heating in the chromosphere. If chromospheric plasma is directly heated
to coronal temperatures and ejected upward, might this explain much of what we observe in the

corona? : =

We have looked at this question carefully and concluded that the answer is no [61-64].
