In no case does the difference exceed 0°00002, though the absolute values for the
density are liable at 18 per cent. NaOH to an error of 0°00004 on account of the fact
that the concentration is only known to 1 part in 5000.

Comparison with the Results of other Observers.—With the help of the temperature
coefficients deduced in Part III. of the paper, it is possible without any loss of
accuracy to calculate the values for the density at 15° C. and so to make a comparison
of our results with those of other investigators. This has been done in Table VI. of
the paper, in which the densities at 18° C. and 15° C. are given for each exact
percentage from 0 to 50. On account both of errors of titration and impurities in
the solutions the earlier values are in almost every case higher than those given in
Table VI., and the errors extend in some cases even into the second place of
decimals.* The deviations from our determination at five typical concentrations are
as follows :—
