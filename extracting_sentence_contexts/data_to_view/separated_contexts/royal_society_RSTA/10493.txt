To establish the relation,
however, it is necessary that a very much larger number of experiments should be
carried out. In the table only five of the experiments correspond to the minimum
potential fall. This follows from the fact that the investigation had for its first aim
the production of a margin, and not the determination of the limits of voltage within
which this may be produced. Two of the boundaries previously referred to for which no satisfactory conditions

could be found are the x Cl and us Cl. From Table IL. it is seen that for this pair

of solutions no change in potential slope is brought about.
