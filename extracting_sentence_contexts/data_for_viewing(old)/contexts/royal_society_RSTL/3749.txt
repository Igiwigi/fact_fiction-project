manifest that every pair parallel to the line 4 e represents a stronger mechanical
couple than every corresponding pair parallel to fg. The consequence is, that a cube
of crystallized bismuth suspended in the manner described, in a sufficiently uniform
field of magnetic force, will move in the same direction as the cross in fig. 4: its
centre of gravity will therefore approach the pole N, which was to be demonstrated.

This deduction is perfectly illustrated by experiment. Tt is manifest that the effect
of the pole S upon the cube adjacent to it is to increase the moment of rotation of
the rectangular box : the same reasoning applies to it as to the pole N.

Referring to fig. 27a, page 41, it will be seen that we have here dealt with the
second and gravest objection of M. MarTevecr, and converted the facts upon which
the objection is based into a proof of diamagnetic polarity, s0 cogent that it alone
would seem to be sufficient to decide this important question. Holding the opinion
entertained by M. Marrevect regarding the nature of diamagnetic force#, his objec-
tion must have appeared to him to be absolutely unanswerable: I should be glad to
believe that the remarks contained in this *Appendix* furnish, in the estimation of
the distinguished philosopher referred to, a satisfactory explanation of the difficulty
which he has disclosed.

Let me, in conclusion, briefly direct the reader's attention to the body of evidence
laid before him in the foregoing pages. It has been proved that matter is repelled
by the pole of a magnet in virtue of an induced condition into which the matter is
thrown by such a pole. It is shown that the condition evoked by one pole is not
