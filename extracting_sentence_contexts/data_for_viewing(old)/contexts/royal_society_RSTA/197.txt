regarding organisms as open systems. But there are other reasons also. I think
that the best way to explain that is mathematical.

We model many biological processes as systems of differential equations. These
equations describe the rates at which those processes occur. The number of
such equations depends on the kind of question we are asking. At a cellular
or subcellular (protein network) level, there may be a few dozen equations for
he protein and other chemical entities involved. When we include structural
details at the tissue or organ level, we may be dealing with millions of equations.
Whatever the number, there is an inescapable requirement before we can begin to
solve the equations. We must know or make plausible guesses for the initial and
xoundary conditions. They are not set by the differential equations themselves.
These conditions restrain the solutions that are possible. In fact, beyond a certain
evel of complexity, the more interesting question becomes the explanation of
hat restraining set of conditions, not just the behaviour of the system, since
he restraints may completely change the behaviour of the system. A restraint,
herefore, is not necessarily a feedback. Restraints can be simply the background
set of conditions within which the system operates, i.e. its environment. Through
hese interactions organisms can adapt to many different conditions. Their
robustness in doing so distinguishes them from complex nonlinear systems that
are highly sensitive to initial conditions or which end up unable to escape
attractors.

7. ‘Genetic programs’
This is a suitable point at which to return to the question of ‘genetic programs’.
