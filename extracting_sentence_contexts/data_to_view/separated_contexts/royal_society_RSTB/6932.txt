MITOTIC ACTIVITY IN THE ADULT FEMALE MOUSE 455

II. MATERIAL AND METHODS
(1) Material

Nearly five hundred female mice were examined in the course of this investigation, and
they belonged, with only a few exceptions, to the following three strains:

(a) Strong’s CBA agouti. These cancer-resistant black agoutis are prolific breeders, and
during the many years in which they have been under observation in the Zoology Depart-
ment of Leeds University, no spontaneous tumours have been recorded in either sex in
spite of the fact that many have been allowed to live to extreme old age. (b) Kreyberg’s white label albino. Also prolific breeders, these albino mice, isolated by
Kreyberg, have been preserved because of their susceptibility to spontaneous cancer.
