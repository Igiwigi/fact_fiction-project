On the other hand, the extreme thinness of
3 the inner layers of the retina at the centre of the foyea, places the bacillary layer here
Smost favourably for receiving incident light. S 2. The division of the rods and cones into an outer and an inner segment is natural.
&The facts in support of this are, the presence of the division in perfectly fresh specimens ;
=its sharpness and constant occurrence at a definite place; the constantly rectilinear
& figure of the outer, and the curvilinear figure of the inner segment ; the different refrac-
= tive powers of the segments; and their different behaviour towards staining and chemical
Z s0lutions. E 3. From these structural differences it is a fair inference that the segments have dif-
S ferent physiological meanings.
