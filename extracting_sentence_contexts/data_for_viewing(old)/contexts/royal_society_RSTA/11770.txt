obturator, stirring, &¢., had been reduced to a much smaller amount. When
corrected to correspond with the exact period from 13° C. to 55° C. the result of the
first two series is to give the mean value of J for tap-water from 13° C. to 55° C. as
4177 and that of the third series 4179. Owing to the largeness of the correction for
heating by obturator, &c., in the first two series we do not bring the results into the
average, but take the exact corrected figure yielded by the third series as the basis
of our calculations, that is to say, for “ tap-water” the mean value of J for the
interval from 13° ©. to 54°25 C. is 4°1785, or corrected to the interval from 13° C. to
55° C. we have

Jus” = 4°1788.

This figure is also entitled to special weight owing to the fact that the thermometer

and the standard resistance and battery of nine standard cells had all been sent

again to the National Physical Laboratory to be re-calibrated, and had been returned

only a few days before this third series of continuous-flow experiments was made,

and that the bridge and mercury thermometer-resistances were also re-calibrated from
