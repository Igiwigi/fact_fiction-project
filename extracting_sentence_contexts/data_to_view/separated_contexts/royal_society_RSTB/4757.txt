It is evident also that, apart from the question of the correlation of successive values,
the correlations between two series will be vitiated in the same manner as by the variate
difference method, though to a less degree ; the correlations obtained may be expressed
in terms of high differences of the true correlations, for if we write

#(8") = FB 8+ F89+ 183+ 193" + ai 3

and

then we have

The general problem of eliminating the cross correlations from a pair of series showing
slow changes is extremely complex ; in the simplest case each value of the one series
is correlated with only two adjacent values of the second series. ‘To this case probably
belongs the relation of wheat crop to weather, for the crop is admittedly much affected
by the weather in the harvest year, and may to a much less extent be influenced, through
the condition of the seed, or of the soil, by the weather of the previous year. It is
fortunate, therefore, that one of the examples, upon which the largest amount of work
has been expended, is probably also of the same type, and will serve to indicate the order
of magnitude of the errors to be expected, through neglecting the cross correlation of the
crop with the weather of the previous year. The two series of infantile death rates in the first and second years of life, are probably
connected principally, if not wholly, by the fact that the mortality, in any one year, of
children in the second year of life, refers to nearly the same group of children as the
mortality in the previous year of children in the first year of life ; and by the second fact
that mortality in the two age groups during the same year will be conditioned by the

same meteorological and epidemiological conditions. If the first effect is the main object
of study, the latter will appear as a cross correlation introducing errors into our estimate
of the first effect, according to the method of estimation employed. In 1915 (1) Experron and Pearson found, using the variate difference method,
the value — 0-688 for the correlation between the mortalities of the same group of children
(males) in the two years.
