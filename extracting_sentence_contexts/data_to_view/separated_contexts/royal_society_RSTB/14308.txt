(a) Method

(i) Material

We analysed a set of category production norms [53] that
comprised 67 concrete and 50 abstract categories, where
each category had been classified as abstract versus concrete
based on previous literature and/or WordNet classifications
of the category labels.' The 117 categories covered a range
of taxonomic levels and category types (e.g. living versus
non-living, animate versus inanimate, natural versus arte-
fact), including many categories frequently studied in the
categorization literature (e.g. animal, furniture and emotion)
as well as more novel abstract categories (e.g. personal quality
and statistical term), thus providing a large range of categories
for comparison. The member concepts of each category in the
norms were acquired from a sample of 60 UK-based native
speakers of English who completed a computer-based cat-
egory production (a.k.a. verbal fluency) task. Each
participant completed the task for 39 categories, and verbally
named as many category members as possible within 60 s per
category.
