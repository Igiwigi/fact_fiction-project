ANATOMY OF THE ALIMENTARY CANAL. 453

as to the manner in which fat traversed the villas : HexLs (15), SCHWANN (16), DoxpeRs
(12), K611axeR (44), and Brvcn (18). Doxpurs further spoke of the chyle-vessels as
posses8ing a membrane.

HexLe (15), 1837, showed that the intestine is covered by a layer of epithelium.

Goopsm (7), 1842, firs: noticed that the epithelial cells apparently contain fat-
granules. He did not, however, lay any stress on the fact, but supposed that certain
* yesicles‚Äù close to the membrane have the property of absorbing, and that the epithe-
lium is cast off previous to absorption. This author saw the membrana propria clearly,
and considered that the nuclei situated in it at regular distances were the germinal
spots from which the epithelium is reproduced.

Lacarente (19), 1843, first noticed the moyements of the villi, and attributed them to
a system of muscles. He considered each villus to be a system of sncking- and forcing-
pumps (aspirantes et foulantes).

GruBy and DELaFoND (20), 1842 and 1843, found chyle in the epithelial cells, and
thought that each epithelial cell must be considered an organ specially charged to receive
raw chyle, and convert it to a homogeneous chyle, and to transmit the liquid thus made.
