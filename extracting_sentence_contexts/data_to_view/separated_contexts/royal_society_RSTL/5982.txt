The change of inclination last mentioned, s0 far from marking the limit at which
transverse crevasses begin to be formed, is sufficient to produce chasms of great magni-
tude, and in most inconvenient numbers. Higher up the glacier, transverse crevasses
are produced by a change of inclination from 3 10' to 5%. If this change be accurately
protracted, the mere inspection of it will illustrate more forcibly than words can do the
absence of the power of viscous yielding on the part of the ice.

Looked at broadly, then, two classes of facts address themselves to the attention of the
glacier investigator ; one entirely in accordance with the idea of viscosity, and the other
as entirely opposed to it. 'The affirmers and deniers of the viscous theory have perhaps
been influenced too exclusively by one or the other of these classes of phenomena. 'The
analysis of the facts gives the result, that where pressure comes into play we have the
evidences of apparent viscosity *, but where 7ension is active we have evidences of an
opposite kind.
