large numerousness (2 versus 8) and (iii) two large numbers
(6 versus 9, 8 versus 12, 8 versus 14), also when continuous vari-
ables (overall area and perimeter) were controlled [48]. It is to be
noticed here that by equating the overall perimeter of square
elements, an inverse correlation between number of elements

and overall area occurs [5]. This means that chicks could not
base their responses either on overall area or perimeter. More-
over, 3-day-old chicks also succeeded in a task that implies the
discrimination between larger numbers, when overall area, over-
all perimeter, area and density were contemporarily controlled
[51]. This indicates that while feeding, chicks spontaneously
encoded numerical information. They in fact were not trained
by operant conditioning, nor were they required to respond by
pecking on the stimuli for food reinforcement.

Data gathered in these experiments, and especially the suc-
cess in comparing a small (two) and a larger numbers (eight),
support and expand to the dominion of very young non-
humans animals, the hypothesis that AMS can distinguish
quantities along the numerical continuum. Evidence in this
direction was previously reported in adult humans performing
a non-symbolic numerical task [6], seven-month-old infants
[52] and other species [7,33,47]. These results also indicate
that chicks can discriminate two numerosities, characterized
