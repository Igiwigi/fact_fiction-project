But in the sporogonia of most Bryophytes
(which probably took origin along several distinct lines of descent) a central columella
is present ; this columella serves the function of nutrition and water-supply, and in
some cases of mechanical dispersion.* Goebel notes} how the columella varies in bulk

* For a comparative account, based upon views of progressive sterilisation in sporogonia of Bryophytes,
see GOEBEL, ‘ Organographie,’ pp. 326-329 for Liverworts, and pp. 373-376 for Mosses. I see no reason
why a comparison which gives such useful results in Bryophytes should not be extended to Pteridophytes
also. The fact that the vegetative development has gone further in the latter is no sufficient reason for
neglecting the lines of analogy between the two series of the Archegoniate.

in proportion to the number of spores, being largest where the spores are most
numerous ; this indicates its importance in supply. But the other factor, necessity
for dispersion of the spores, does not in any way determine the position of the fertile
cells in the Bryophytes, for all the more elaborate sporogonia dehisce by longitudinal
slits, or by an operculum, either of which methods would give freedom even to spores
produced at considerable depths in the tissue.
