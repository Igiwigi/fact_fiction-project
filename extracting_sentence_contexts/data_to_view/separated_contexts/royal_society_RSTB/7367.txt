36 R. H. D. SHORT ON THE ALVEOLAR EPITHELIUM

proximal parts of the lumen persists as bronchiolar epithelium, in which quantitative evidence of
normal cell division is found. These facts explain the difficulty in interpreting the picture of cell outlines which is seen when
silver nitrate impregnates the cement lines between epithelial cells. In the earlier days of embryonic
life the impregnated cell outlines reveal the regular meshwork characteristic of a complete epithelium. In the adult lung no such clear and regular picture is seen, and a close study of the intervening stages
discloses that this irregularity of cell outlines starts at the 24th day and progresses with the de-
generative changes in the epithelium and extrusion of nuclei.
