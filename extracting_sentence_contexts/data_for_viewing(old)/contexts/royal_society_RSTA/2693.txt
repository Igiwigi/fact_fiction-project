a parameter.

In our simulations, for the sake of computational feasibility, we concentrate on the strong
frictional instability regime where the b parameter is greater than a critical value b,. In fact, b,
is determined solely by the elastic parameter ¢ [40-42]. In 1D, it is given by b, = 2¢? + 1, while in
2D it is given by bp = 4¢? + 1. In the following, we put ¢ =3 corresponding to b, = 37, and vary b
in the range of b > bc, ie. 40 < b < 80. Other parameters are fixed to be a=1, c= 1000, v* = 10-2
and v = 10-8.

Concerning the system size L, we put mainly L = 500, but additionally put L = 1000 and 1500 to
check the system-size dependence. Periodic boundary conditions are assumed in both directions.
Concerning the initial conditions, all blocks are assumed to be at rest, i.e. vj; =0 (1 <i,j <L)att=
0, and the state variable is set to 4; =10!2. This large number comes from the fact that the interval
time of large events of the model tends to be extremely long reflecting the very slow loading
velocity of v =10-®. The displacement of each block is taken to be random uniformly distributed
between [—500, 500] from block to block. Events at earlier times are transient and are affected in
a non-stationary manner by the initial conditions. We wait until the system reaches the stationary
state, typically discarding initial 10° events. Averages are then taken by using subsequent 10° —
10° events.

3. Results

In this section, we present the results of our simulations on the 2D BK model obeying the RSF
law. In the stationary state, the model exhibits a sequence of earthquake-like events of various
