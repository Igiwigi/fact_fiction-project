the thermometer at temperatures up to above 4K by replacing the aluminium wire bonds with
niobium. These with niobium bonding wires would certainly allow one to use the thermometer
up to temperatures above 4K. Nevertheless, the wide range of accessible temperatures made
a thorough characterization of the thermometer possible. Above 12.6mK, a RuO2 thermometer
read out by an LR 700 resistance bridge was used as a reference thermometer. This resistance
thermometer was calibrated by a superconducting fix point device (SRM 768 from NBS) [28]. At
temperatures below 12.6mK, the reference temperature was provided by a pulsed !Pt NMR
thermometer which was read out by PLM4 electronics.>

Figure 3a shows the power spectral density of flux noise obtained using the cross-correlation
method at different temperatures. The recording time for one cross-correlation spectrum was
400s leading to a statistical precision of better than 1% for the given bandwidth of about 100 Hz.
The fact that the overall shape is in very close approximation identical for all spectra indicates

that the resistivity of the noise-generating copper piece did not change in the entire temperature 6 |
range on a relevant level as expected. The solid lines through the data points of each spectrum
assume an identical spectral shape and fit each dataset very well. According to (1.2) the prefactor â€œ3
of this fit is expected to vary linearly with temperature. In figure 3b, this prefactor is plotted for 1B
different reference temperatures. The noise temperature of the copper source, Ty, is obtained by a
assigning one of the prefactors the temperature of the reference thermometer. This perfect linear :3
dependence over almost 5 orders of magnitude clearly demonstrates the capability of this type of 12
noise thermometer of being a relative primary thermometer. :
