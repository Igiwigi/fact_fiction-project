Here, we look at local bifur- tively abrupt transitions but although these can be loosely
cations with eigenvalues that smoothly diminish to zero, like attributed to tipping points, the alternative ‘states’ in such

why we can anticipate a critical transition in advance lies in a negative feedback starts to operate ‘moving’ environmental

the fact that prior to a bifurcation point small disturbances conditions backwards till a shift to the previous state takes


Box 1. The relationship between resilience, CSD and early warnings. Ecological resilience (ecR) depends on the distance to the border of the unstable manifold in state space (ds) and on the dis-
tance to the critical threshold (dp) in parameter space [ecR = f(ds,dp)] (a).
