Whether the conduction be considered as depending upon the de-
composition, or not (413. 703.), till the relation of the two functions is equally inti-
mate and inseparable.

855. Considering this close and twofold relation, namely, that without decompo-
sition transmission of electricity does not occur; and, that for a given definite quantity
of electricity passed, an equally definite and constant quantity of water or other matter
is decomposed ; considering also that the agent, which is electricity, is simply employed
in overcoming electrical powers in the body snbjected to its action ; it seems a pro-
bable, and almost a natural consequence, that the quantity which passes is the equiza-
lent of, and therefore equal to, that of the particles separated ; i. e. that if the electrical
power which holds the elements of a grain of water in combination, or which makes a
grain of oxygen and hydrogen in the right proportions unite into water when they are
made to combine, could be thrown into the condition of @ current, it would exactly
equal the current required for the separation of that grain of water into its elements
again.

856. This view of the subject gives an almost overwhelming idea of the extraor-
dinary quantity or degree of electric power which naturally belongs to the particles
of matter; but it is not inconsistent in the slightest degree with the facts which can
be brought to bear on this point. To illustrate this I must say a few words on the
voltaic pile.

temperature of dull redness, equal quantities of water were decomposed in equal times in both cages. When
the half-inch was used, only the centre portion of wire was ignited.
