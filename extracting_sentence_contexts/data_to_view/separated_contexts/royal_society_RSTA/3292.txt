In fact,
a sharper bound is obtained from equation (3.23) and is given by

2p?9(k —c)*d*
[P(0, —dint) — Patm]?’
if velocity measurements are not available and cannot be used. If pressure measurements are not available and only velocity measurements are available
instead, then the following bound is obtained from equation (3.22) (since P(L/2,—dint) > Patm;
see [14])

H< (3.26)

It may be noted that if measurements at the flat bed are available, then bounds based on
pressure measurements become sharper than those based on velocity measurements, while
velocity measurements should be used to arrive at sharper bounds when measurements are taken
closer to the free surface.

(3.27)


Another interesting point to note, as was also observed in [14], is that, when k = c, the bounds in
equations (3.22)-(3.24) and equations (3.26)-(3.27) all lead to a Stokes wave of trivial amplitude. This is equivalent to the fact that a Stokes wave of the same speed as an underlying uniform
current can only coexist if the top surface is flat. Hence, the case k =c needs no further perusal.

4. Estimates on wave heights: k < ¢

To deal with this case, let us define ¢ = c — k > 0.
