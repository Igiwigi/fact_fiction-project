That is, in order for an action successfully to reduce pre-
diction error, the brain must represent not only the hidden
causes of current sensory signals but also must use these rep-
resentations to predict how sensory signals would change
under specific actions [35]. Interestingly, it has been suggested
that such counterfactual aspects of perceptual prediction
may underlie basic properties perceptual experience, such as
‘presence’ or ‘objecthood’ [36]. To enable predictions about the consequences of action to
be fulfilled, we have to attenuate proprioceptive prediction
errors—that would otherwise deliver unequivocal evidence
that we are not, in fact, acting. This attenuation rests on redu-
cing the precision of proprioceptive prediction errors. Precision can be regarded as a measure of signal-to-noise or
confidence.
