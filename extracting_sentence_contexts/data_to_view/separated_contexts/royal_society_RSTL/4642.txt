Order BrvuTa (Edentata, Cvuv.). The exogenous processes of the vertebre present their greatest and most complex
developments in this order, but by no means with that degree of uniformity which
renders their modifications characteristic of some of the preceding Orders. The two
extremes in the degree of development are, in fact, presented by the much-diversified
families of the present extraordinary group of mammals. The spinous processes are almost obsolete in a great part of the unusually long
dorso-lumbar region of the 'Two-toed Sloth (Bradypus didactylus), and the metapo-
physes would be hardly recognizable if their modifications had not been previously
traced in other mammals. The first indication of them is seen in the penultimate
dorsal vertebra, where they appear as angular productions from the upper and fore-
part of the diapophyses: in the last dorsal they have advanced clear of the diapo-
physis to the outer side of the prozygapophysis, the articular surface of which begins
to ascend upon them ; and they continue, as low and long tuberoxsities, above the pro-
zygapophyses, thronghout the lumbar region.
