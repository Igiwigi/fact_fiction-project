heterogeneous orientation, corresponding to the aligned crystallites which give rise to
the «-photograph described above. ‘That there actually is some crystalline protein in
random orientation is shown by the fact that in several of the photographs obtained a
weak ‘‘ powder ring” can be traced passing through (001).

The second of the additional points of interest mentioned above is that, in photo-
graphs of the fine animal hairs. such as Merino wool, much of the centre is obscured by
another halo of high “ spacing.” Plate 2, fig. 3, shows this effect well ; in fact, in Merino
photographs, the (100) spots cannot be observed on this account. The effect is less
obvious in Cotswold wool and practically non-existent in human hair and porcupine
quill. It seems clear that this intense central halo arises from the scales of the hairs,
which are most prominent in Merino wool, less so in Cotswold, and least of all in human
hair and porcupine quill. The most beautiful photograph of all was obtained from the
tip-end of a porcupine quill, and in this case the scales accounted for a negligible fraction
of the bulk of the material irradiated.

A method was devised for stripping human hair of the whole of the cuticle and scales.
‘This was accomplished by making the hair the string of a wire bow, of the ’cello pattern,
and drawing it rapidly backwards and forwards through coarsely powdered glass under
a slight pressure. ‘The arrangement is shown diagrammatically in fig. 2. ‘The glass is
