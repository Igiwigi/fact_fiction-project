In other words, as ConKLIN (2) has
remarked, the larval mesoblast is ancestral and might be called the “
distinction to the “secondary” mesoblast. It is not improbable, therefore, as
already mentioned, that it corresponds with the general mesoblastic tissue of
Platyhelminths, while the secondary mesoblast would correspond with the mesoderm
of the genital follicles of these forms. In fact, young larvee, such as that represented
in fig. 30, consist of ectoderm, endoderm, and larval mesenchyme, the definite
mesoderm being present only potentially, so to speak, as two cells in the anal region,
not different in any way from the other ectoderm cells among which they lie. As
the most primitive of mesodermic tissues, we should expect the larval mesoblast of
Annelids to possess the “ ancestral reminiscence,” as WILSON (24) has termed it, that
we find it does in reality possess.
