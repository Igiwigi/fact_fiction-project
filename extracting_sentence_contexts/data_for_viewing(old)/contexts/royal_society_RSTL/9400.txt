The 8um of these three values of - gives the total rate of change of obliquity due

both to &un and moon, on the assumption that the three semi-diurnal terms may be
grouped together, as also the three diurnal ones.

It will be observed that the joint effect tends to counteract the separate effects ; this
ariges from the fact that, as far as regards the joint effect, the two disturbing bodies
may be replaced by rings of matter concentric with the earth but oblique to the
equator, and such a ring of matter would cause the obliquity to diminish, as was shown
in the abstract of this paper (Proc. Roy. Soc., No. 191, 1878), by general considera-
tions, must be the cage.
