However, recently Rajagopal [31,32] developed implicit
algebraic constitutive relations in that one has an implicit relationship between the stress and the
symmetric part of the velocity gradient (see also Rajagopal & Saccomandi [33] for a discussion of
general algebraic implicit models). A subclass of such models are fluids whose symmetric part of
the velocity gradient is given in terms of the stress, and a further subclass are fluids referred to as
generalized stress power-law fluids [34] where the symmetric part of the velocity gradient is given
as a power law of the stress. In fact, for an infinite range of values of the power-law exponent,
the expression for the velocity gradient in terms of the stress cannot be inverted, that is, one
cannot obtain an expression for the stress in terms of the velocity gradient. This is made evident
when we consider a simple one-dimensional shear flow. The relationship between the norm of
the deviatoric part of the stress in terms of the norm of the symmetric part of the velocity gradient
is portrayed in figure 1 for such a flow.
