Fig. 48. Side view of the blotched colour-variety. The importance ofthis colour-form
lies in the fact that it is based on an underlying “ liner” pattern seen in
fig. 45, and that it occurs in other species of Crustacea, for example in
Hippolyte cranchii and H. pusiola. (See the text, Section V., p. 324.)

Fig. 49. Dorsal view of the “ blotched” colour-form of Hippolyte varians, showing
that the primary system may give rise indirectly to a part of the colour
pattern, which in this case is formed in a very definite and segmental
manner. Round the liver, on the carapace and pleura, bands of chromato-
phores arise,

Figs. 50-52 are side views of [ippolyte varians (primary system of adolescent-stage),
of Mysis flecuosa and of Anaspides, A comparison shows that the
neural group of chromatophores occurs in all three animals at the base of
the appendages; that a more restricted visceral group occurs in the
Hippolyte and Mysis (Pre-card, Post-card and G,, G,); and that a caudal
group occurs in all three genera.
