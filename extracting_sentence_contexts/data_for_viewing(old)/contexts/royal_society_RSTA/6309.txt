which clearly includes (4.4) upon truncation of the series. Moreover, Beatty's reinterpretation of

the Arruda—Boyce model as an average stretch model [51] with A; = V3) = J/I,/3, for which in
fact the number of representative chains M becomes irrelevant, implies that more than one ‘route’
within the proposed four-step scheme can lead to the same phenomenological model, as indicated
by the purple path in figure 3.

Apart from I;-polynomial-type free energies, known to be inadequate for describing the chain
extensibility limit [37], the same strategies highlighted in blue and purple in figure 3 yield Gent's
model [67,68] with parameters yc and Jm,

if instead of a Taylor series the inverse Langevin function is approximated through a rational
expression of the form 7” —l(x) ~ 3x/(1 — x?), in line with the approach of Warner [56]; see also
[58]. This is indicated by the green path in figure 3. Note that this rational function is not a
