density matrix and we will consider this later).

For a fixed state vector A, there are Hamiltonians which generate the same dynamical
evolution of Proba(t). It is useful to briefly illustrate this, because it motivates the discussion
of the more general case. Let us consider the situation when |) =A = (4). Then, Prob,(t) =
\(W(B)|A)|2, where |y(t)) =e7#"? |A), and n-o isa general Hamiltonian. Since |y(t)) = ew imo |),
then Prob,(t) = |(Ale~? |A) |?. Now consider an alternative Hamiltonian, produced by rotating
n by an angle a about the z-axis; the new Hamiltonian would be given by n'-o. The
corresponding unitary operator is given by n'-o =e~#:/2n. gel"?:/?, Noting that Ce®C-l=
CBC (this identity is independent of whether B and C commute and can be easily verified
with a Taylor expansion), we have |w/(t)) =e7!!""*|A) =e tet Pmae1 4) So, Prob’ 4(t) =
[W(BIA) I? = | (Alei#0=/2e-tttr9 eta: /2|A) |? = |(Ale~i#/2ei @it/2|A) |? The last equality employs
the fact that oz|A)=|A)=(}), and then the three operators e!“/?, e~i"@ and e~!*/? commute.
So we conclude Prob’ 4(t) = |(Ale~#"* |A)|?, exactly as before. In the Bloch representation, it
corresponds to the same behaviour of projection of the evolved state vector on the z-axis (cf.
figure 2c with e and figure 2d with f). Note that this analysis relies on the particular relation
between the state and the form of considered Hamiltonians. In general, the Hamiltonian will
have impact on the dynamics of Proba(t). This is best illustrated with the Bloch sphere, in terms
of the effect of each of oy, oy and o, on the rotation of the state vector.

We always consider Prob, (t), A = (4). Consider a comparison between |y(t1)) =e!" |yW(to))
and |y(tz)) =e" |y(to)), where ty > t;. As time increases, we can think of # as tracing the
circumference of a disc whose centre is n. So, if |y(t1)) is set as in figure 2a, then an increase in t
will translate at first into an increased Proba(t), followed by a decrease; eventually, it will return
to the initial value. If all we are interested in is changes in Prob,(t) with time (or some other
