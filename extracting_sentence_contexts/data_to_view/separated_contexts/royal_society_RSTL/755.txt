But this selection of stars will be limiting the use of the. in-
strument, and the advantage of. a mean of a number of ob-
servations lost ; and in fact, with respect to the index errors
used in determining the N. P, D. of » Lyre, « Aquilz, and «
Cygni, as given by Mr. PoxD, Phil. Trans, 1817, no parti-
cular selection of stars, with a view to these points, seems to
have been made. It may also perhaps be suggested, that the mural circle
may be used without applying index error, as was done with


parallaz of certain fixed stars.
