S Tb appears in the highes6 degree improbable that the entoderm cells should

ie completely disappear to be snbsequently re-developed in precisely the same form. A

Sar more credible conclusion is that the yolk-vesicles are taken bodily into the cells

-2.in 8uch numbers as finally to obscure the cell-outlines entirely. The entoderm then

E seems to have disappeared and only makes its re-appearance when the yolk-vesicles

Shave been assimilated by the protoplasm of the cells. This conclusion is sbrengthened

= Z by the fact that in JourDaN's figure of the larva of Actinia equina (l.c., fig. 119,
S plate 16) the entoderm cells are figured, before the absorption of the yolk has begun,
as clear, well defined, and destitute of yolk-vesicles, while the gastric cavity is

Z completely filled with * vesicules hyalines ‚Äù precisely like those of Balanophyllia.

D This condition, according to my view, precedes one like the earlier stage of Balano-

S phyllia im which absorption has recently begun and in which the entoderm cells

E resemble those of Astacus, as figured by RewcnexBACH,*

- In all known Aleyonarians the central mass, though at firss unsegmented, does
