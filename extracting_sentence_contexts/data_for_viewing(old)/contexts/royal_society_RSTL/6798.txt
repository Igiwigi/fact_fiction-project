glass and another of white glass, reversed in position, 80 as to form, when combined, a
parallel plate. This is held firmly in its place by means of a spring, shown in fig. 3,
which, while it holds the shade firmly in any required position, also allows its instant
removal at pleasure. The glass reflector e, as s00n as the observer desires to use the
silvered surface, can be drawn forward in a small fraction of a second, without disturb-
ing any other part of the instrument.

In the focus of the positive eyepiece was fixed a piece of parallel glass on which were
etched several lines; this micrometer-plate was carried round with the eyepiece when-
ever the index, @ (figs. 1 & 3), was moved. A reference to Plate VI., which contains
a fac-simile of my hand-drawings, and also a representation of the position-lines, will
render clear the following explanation. Four principal lines on the glass plate formed a
tangential square calculated to enclose exactly the moon's disk, which in fact it accom-
plished with great precision ; four other lines surrounded the first s8quare at the distance
of exactly 1' of arc; and a third series formed a third s8quare at the same distance from
the second. Joining the angles of the squares were two diagonal fainter lines, which
served to measure angles of position, while the several squares s8erved to measure
distances. The angles of the tangential square may be designated A, B, C, D. As

500n as the axis of the telescope-stand had been adjusted in a vertical position by


means of screws affixed to the feet of the tripod-stand, and of a level attached to the
yertical axis of the telescope, a distant mountain peak was made to run along one of the
lines D A or CB by causing the telescope to turn on the vertical axis when the index
