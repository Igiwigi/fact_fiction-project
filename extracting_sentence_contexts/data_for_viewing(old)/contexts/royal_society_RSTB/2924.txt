again, this time to only 30 millims., and the respirations ceased, but at the end
of the 20th minute another series of convulsive respirations was followed by a
second rise of the blood pressure and another series of waves with a very definite
relationship to the now infrequent inspirations. This sequence of events was repeated
three times more, as the figures above given show, but the amplitude of the pressure
waves became less each time, and at the end of the 37th minute the pressure finally
fell, the succeeding convulsive inspirations failing to improve it, and death ensued.
At each of the pressure failures the record of the pulse beat became less and less
marked, and was no longer evident in the final fall.

The absence of the intravascular clotting (except very slight in the pulmonary
vessels), post-mortem in this case was somewhat surprising, and made it very difficult
to account for the facts observed on the theory that they were due to the blood
changes known to be produced by Daboia venom, unless it might be that there
was clotting in the capillary vessels of the lung producing obstruction of the
circulation, which was temporarily overcome by the greatly increased intrathoracic
pressure produced by the respiratory convulsions. This appeared to me the most
probable explanation of the curve, and it became necessary to devise some means of
testing its truth. In order to do this I determined to repeat the experiment
and after death to see what pressure was required to pass fluids through the
pulmonary circulation, so as to be able to form a rough estimate of the degree of
obstruction, if any, present in them, which might possibly be due to capillary
clotting.
