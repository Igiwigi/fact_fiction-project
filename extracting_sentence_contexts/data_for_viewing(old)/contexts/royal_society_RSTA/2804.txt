Much of the oldest silicic continental crust is represented as TTGs and there has been much
debate as to whether any, some or all of these might have formed during subduction or melting
of stacked oceanic slabs of hydrated basalts [19]. Many have negative HFSE anomalies but, as
noted above, these signatures can also be inherited. For example, several recent studies of TTGs
have invoked partial melting of basalts within the crust in their petrogenesis. Adam et al. [97]
undertook an experimental study of tonalite from the Nuvvuagittuq belt in Canada and Johnson
et al. [98] studied TTGs from the East Pilbara. A key observation of both studies is that the
identified protolith basalts had arc-like signatures (e.g. negative HFSE anomalies) and, due to the
large extent of partial melting required [97], this is efficiently transferred to the resultant TTGs.
Thus, if the question is ‘Were these TTGs formed by subduction?’, the answer is no; but if the
question is ‘When did subduction occur?’ then in both cases, the answer must be significantly
before the age of the TTGs and in fact when their protoliths were formed. The Coucal basalts


from the East Pilbara are 3.5 Ga in age, suggesting some form of subduction in this region at that
time.

The age of the Nuvvuagittuq mafic rocks may be more debatable, but because these are cross-
cut by tonalites and gabbros of approximately 3.8-4.1 Ga age, 4.1Ga is arguably a minimum age
for these mafic rocks [99]. Moreover, Turner et al. [33] showed that, not only do the Nuvvuagittuq
mafic rocks overlie modern arc rocks on a plot of Th/Yb versus Nb/Yb, but they also record the
same geochemical stratigraphy as the lowermost sequences in modern subduction zones. The
recent analysis of Pearce & Reagan [93] further reinforces the subduction-like nature of the mafic
Nuvvuagittuq mafic rock sequences (figure 7), and so there is an increasingly strong case that
