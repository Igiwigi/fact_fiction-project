At this point, the General Discussion gave way to a live broadcast, of about 15 minutes, of the BBC Radio 4 programme
‘The material world’. This broadcast was essentially a radio report of the Discussion Meeting. The programme contained a
conversation between its presenter, Quentin Cooper, 7. F. Allen, and W. F. Doolittle, and had been recorded on the previous
evening. The BBC’s production title for the feature was ‘Mighty mitochondria’.

J. F. Allen. Just before we got distracted, Mike [Russell] in fact had his hand politely raised for some 15 or 20
minutes.

M. J. Russell. Yes, I think that there is some unfinished business, and I think that geologists really have to talk to
biochemists, biologists and microbiologists and vice versa. What we have got to realize is that you are backtracking,
and fair enough, you have got to go back in time, but we have got to consider a bottom-up approach, in other
words, we take initial conditions seriously. So we have got to see why life would have started and when it did and
also to remind people that geological time is not something you can just use willy-nilly. In fact, in order to get a
living system going would probably take days or weeks. If you just think of the incubator where life started it would
self-organise very quickly, otherwise it would not get off the ground, so to speak. So it is much shorter; the span
of life originating is short, and the molecules that we use are much shorter than people have assumed. You are
not using them as energy, you are using basic molecules like carbon monoxide, methane, formaldehyde, and so

forth, but the scale of the system from which life generates is solar, of course, because we have to have light coming
to split charge. That does not mean to say it is photosynthesis, just photolysis to give you redox. So that has all
