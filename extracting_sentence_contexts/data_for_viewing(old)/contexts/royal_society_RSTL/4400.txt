this subject from time to time during the last twelve months.

It should be mentioned that no part of the Rugby wire was disconnected in these
experiments, but that the whole length of wire was in action, and therefore exposed
to the same influences from atmospheric currents, induction, or thermo-electric
action, There was no alteration whatever made in the wire excepting the change of
position of one of its earth connections ; and consequently the reversing of the direc-
tion of the current in the wire, as compared with that of the Willington wire, cannot
be attributed to any other cause.

The question naturally presents itself, from whence do these currents arise 7

On this subject an important fact was ascertained during the large deflections
which occurred in September and October, namely, that spontaneous deflections of

precisely the same character as those described in the foregoing part of this paper,
were found to take place on the short telegraph from the Electric Telegraph office in
the Strand to the Nine Elms Station, the wires of which are laid underground in
tubes throughout their length.

Taking this fact in connection with those before mentioned, viz. that no deflection
is produced in a wire suspended throughout its length in the air, that no deflection
