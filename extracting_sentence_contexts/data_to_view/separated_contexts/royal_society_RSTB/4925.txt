In fact, there is no indication of a bifurcated arrangement below
the wound, as would be expected if the downward current of food were responsible for
their occurrence. In wounding of the root a similar condition obtains. These are
significant facts, indicating the existence of a stimulus acting apart altogether from
increased food supply. From these more or less theoretical viewpoints, it would seem that the food supply
has little bearing on the problem of the production of resin canals. It must be conceded,
however, that the relative availability of the food material on the bast and on the wood
side of the cambium is a difficult matter to determine, and that it is perhaps better
to connect the food supply aspect with “ vigour of growth.” The latter, however, is
a lax term that its users have not troubled to define, and must be considered from as
many different aspects as possible.
