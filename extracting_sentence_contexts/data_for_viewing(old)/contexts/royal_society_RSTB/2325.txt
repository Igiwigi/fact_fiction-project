Test-tubes containing the extract were kept at a temperature varying from 30° to
60° ©, for several hours, and their activities on starch, salicin, and albumen afterwards
examined. It was found that exposure to a temperature of 50° almost entirely
abolished the activity of the extract towards salicin, whilst it left almost unimpaired
the power of attacking starch and coagulable proteid.

There is therefore further ground for the conclusion that the plant contains three
separate enzymes, one amylolytic, a second proteolytic, and the third glucosidolytic,
and that these three functions are not exerted by one and the same enzyme.

Constituents of the Old Plants,

It has been already mentioned, as a fact known to the Arabs, that old plants with
fully ripe seeds are not poisonous, and we find that old plants furnish little or no
prussic acid when crushed with water. Further examination has proved that lotase
is still present in the plant after maturity, since aqueous extracts were able to effect
the hydrolysis of lotusin and also of amygdalin and salicin, Small quantities of the
colouring matter, lotoflavin, were also present, but lotusin was present either in
minute quantity or was entirely absent.

It would therefore appear that the glucoside, lotusin, is concerned in the metabolism
of the plant after the seeds are ripe, when it gradually disappears and the plant
becomes non-poisonous.

The presence of lotoflavin renders it highly probable that the glucoside is
