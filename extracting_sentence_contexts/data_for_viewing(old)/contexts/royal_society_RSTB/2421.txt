Hymenophyllaceze show the highest complexity of the receptacle, the sporangia
themselves are related in character to more massive types, and that this will justify a
systematic position near to the Loxsomaces and Gleicheniacez, such as that assigned
to the family in the ‘Synopsis Filicum.’ The general construction of the Hymeno-
phyllaceous sorus is well known. Many satisfactory drawings are given by PRESL,§
and other descriptive writers, which show how the sporangia with their oblique
annulus are disposed with regularity of orientation upon the elongated receptacle, so
that they overlap one another like the shields of a Roman testudo. The orientation
for each single sporangium corresponds essentially with that seen in Gleichenia,
Cyathea, Thyrsopteris, Dennstaedtia, and Loxsoma. This is well shown both for
Hymenophyllum and Trichomanes in the drawings of Presi, and in the Genera
Filicum (Plates 31 and 32). The sporangia are, like those of Cyatheze, produced in
basipetal succession upon the more or less elongated receptacle. This fact was noted
