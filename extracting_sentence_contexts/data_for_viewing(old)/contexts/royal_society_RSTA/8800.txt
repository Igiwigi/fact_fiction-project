at Wicklow Head. This is situated in the region where « is positive. We should,
therefore, expect it to be H.W. later on the northern side of the cape than on the
southern side. It is H.W. at Wicklow, a few miles N. of the cape at 10°53,
2h. 30m. later than H.W. at Arklow, some 11 miles south of the cape. This
effect evidently appears to make the co-tidal line travel very slowly past Wicklow
Head.

The other example is that of Greenore Point. In this case « is negative, we should
therefore expect the effect of the coast line to be to make the time of H.W. earlier
on the north side of the cape than on the southern side.

This effect might. if it were sutticiently great, reverse the direction of travel of the
co-tidal line in the neighbourhood of the point. As a matter of fact the effect
is great enough to do this. It is H.W. at Saltees, some 10 miles 8.W. of Carnsore
Point, at 6h. 6m. At Carnsore Point, 4 miles 8. of Greenore Point, it is H.W. at
6h. 25m. At Tuskar Rock, 4 miles out from Greenore Point, it is H.W. at 6h. 10m.
At Wexford South Bay, on the north side of the Point, it is H.W. at 6h. 5m. After
that the time of H.W. gets later as one goes further northwards up the coast. It
will be seen that from Carnsore Point to Wexford South Bay, therefore, the direction
of travel of the co-tidal line is just reversed. The fact that H.W. at Wexford South
Bay, which is well round Greenore Point, is actually earlier than H.W. at Tuskar
Rock which is south of Greenore Point, besides being 4 miles out at sea, is remark-
able. I do not know whether any explanation has been offered before of how it is
that the effect of a cape on the tidal phenomena in its neighbourhood is so very
different in different parts of the sea.
