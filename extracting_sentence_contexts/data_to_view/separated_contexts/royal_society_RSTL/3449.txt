Finally, in the thermo circuit there is that relation to heat which shows that
for every portion of electric force evolved, there is a corresponding change in another
force, or form of force, namely heat, able to account for it ; this the united experi-
ments-of SeeBECK and PELTIER have \shown. But contact) force is a force which has
to produce something from nothing, a result of the contact theory which can be better
stated a little further on (2069. 2071. 2073.).

2063. What evidence then for mere-contact excitement, derivable from the facts of
thermo electricity, remains, since the power must thus be referred to the acid or other
electrolyte used (2060.) and made, not only to vary uncertainly for each metal, but
to vary also in direct conformity with the variation of chemical action (1874. 1956.
1992. 2006. 2014.).

2064, The contact theorist seems to consider that the advocate of the chemical
theory is called upon to account for the phenomena of thermo-electricity. I cannot
perceive that SzEBECK's circle has any relation to the voltaic pile, and think that the
researches of BECQUEREL# are quite sufficient to authorize that conclusion.
