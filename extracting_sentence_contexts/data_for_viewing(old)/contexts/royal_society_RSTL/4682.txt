blood-corpuscles streaming from the attached end of the organ. © The clearness with
which the circulation was perceptible, together with the great abundance of vessels
and the large extent over which they were spread, were circumstances which led me
(says MxgrTexs) to believe this truly enigmatical structure to be an organ, whose
function was the decarbonization of the blood. The ease with which the animal
becomes separated from this organ is no objection to this view; the necessity there
seems to exist for the reproduction of the latter rather confirming my opinion.”

It is highly desirable that more information should be gained about this extraordi-
nary respiratory organ, which, if it exist, will not only be quite $47 generis in its class,
but in all animated nature. And in a physiological point of view, the development
of a vascular network, many times larger than the animal from which it proceeds, in
the course of balf an hour, will be a fact equally unique and startling.

86. As to the zoological relations of Appendicularia, its discoverer, as we have een,
considers that © it may possibly be allied to Cestum,” a conjecture in which no one
can possibly coincide.

Menrexs, on the other hand, says, © 'The relation of this animal with the Pteropoda
is unmistakeable; if the Oikopleura possessed two tail-like appendages, every one
would recognize in them the wings of the Pteropoda ;” and he proceeds to draw, what
seems to me, a very forced comparison between Oikopleura and Clio.
