(v) Adrenal

Normal adult. The adrenal glands are divided into cortex and medulla, the former
being further subdivided into three zones, a narrow outer zona glomerulosa, a prominent
middle zona fasciculata, and an inner zona reticularis. The rate of replacement growth
was studied both in the cortex and the medulla. The cortex was regarded as homogeneous
for the purpose of the mitosis counts which were made on unit section areas of 0-1 sq.mm.
The activity in this region was found to be higher than that in the medulla, and the results
of the counts are shown in table 40 and in figure 7. Few cell divisions were found in
dioestrus and in pro-oestrus, but the mitotic activity increased during early oestrus to reach
a maximum in full oestrus (figure 31, plate 32). Thereafter it fell quickly to another low level
in late oestrus and metoestrus. Throughout the whole cycle the rate of division in the cells
of the medulla was very much lower than that in the cortex, and in fact, no mitoses at all
were discovered in this region during dioestrus, pro-oestrus, and early oestrus. In full
oestrus several cell divisions were found in the medulla, but they were never so numerous
as to make comparative counting easily possible. Two or three mitoses were also found
in late oestrus, but they did not appear to be so numerous at this stage as they were during
full oestrus. None was discovered during metoestrus.
