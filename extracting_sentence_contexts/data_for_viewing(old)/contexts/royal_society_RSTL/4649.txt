In aniline, ethylaniline and diethylaniline, then we have three bases, which may
be considered as derived from ammonia by the elimination and replacement of its
three hydrogen-equivalents. The successive formations of ethylaniline and diethyl-
aniline from aniline have been detailed in the preceding paragraphs; the passage of
ammonia into aniline, when exposed to the action of a phenyl-compound, has been
proved at an earlier period by some experiments, made jointly by M. LaurexT and
myself, upon the action, at a high temperature, of hydrated oxide of phenyl on am-
monia. In this reaction a small but unequivocal quantity of aniline is formed.

The formation of aniline, ethylaniline and diethylaniline, appeared to have esta-
blished in a sufficiently satisfactory manner, the point of theory which is here in
question ; still I thought desirable the acquisition of additional facts in support of
the position to which this inquiry has conducted me. Thus I have been led to study
the action of bromide of ethyl upon several of the derivatives of aniline, and to try
whether other alcohol-radicals, such as methyl and amy], would bave a similar
