that state, we will also have that, DG

pd — p8| ~o. 67 3h

Because of the continuity of the rational functions p = p(u) given by equation (6.4), we must also
have, [8

\uA - uP | ~0, (6.8) : S

otherwise equation (6.7), which holds because of the definition of limit (6.3), would be violated.

This implies that the sync between A, B (that is, that the receiver point B syncs with A) is in
fact effected well before the state 2 =0 is reached. To see this, we note that during an era, starting
from some initial value uR , we obtain the sequence,

uP u® —1,u8 —2,...,u8 —n, (6.9)

which proceeds until when uP —n=x5 has its integer part equal to zero (similarly for the spatial
point A). All such ‘end-of-an-era’ u-values for the A,B points are randomly distributed in the
interval (0,1). Then, any inversion
