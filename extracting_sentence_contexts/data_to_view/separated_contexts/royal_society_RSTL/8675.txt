With respect to the pulse
the comparison of the two experiments holds good also, when we take into consideration
that the rapidity is, in general, greater in the case of the rabbit with divided vagi. Section of the vagi in rabbits does not at once cause the pulse to increase in rapidity. Bearing in mind, therefore, the fact that the full effect of division would occur after the
injection of vanadium, we can ee that there was a gradual decline of rapidity, marked,
as we have noticed in preceding cases, by short periods of acceleration. For the rest,
the animal exhibited the usual conyulsions prior to death. Exp.
