The figures are suggestive, but not conclusive. Although the difference is not significant, we can examine data collected for
puparia of both species kept in cages under fluctuating conditions of temperature. It cannot be regarded as conclusively proved that adults at a high temperature
produce lighter puparia, but the following facts are available. Puparia of Glossina
submorsitans were bred from adults in an incubator at 30째C, and in cages with
monthly mean temperatures fluctuating between 24째 and 28째C. At 30째C, 35
puparia had a mean weight of 21-2 mg, and at the lower temperature 237 puparia
had a mean of 23-5 mg.
