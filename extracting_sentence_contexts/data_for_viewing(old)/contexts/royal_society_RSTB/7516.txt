supply only very incomplete information about the positions of the primordia there, i.e. the
phyllotaxis, for this depends quite as much on radial as on tangential spacing.

For reasons such as these the estimation of divergence angles as a means of characteriza-
tion was rejected.completely by Church (1904). Instead, he pointed out that at the apex
itself, so long as growth is uniform and the primordia arise along the genetic spiral at a
constant angle, then a whole series of logarithmic spirals may be drawn connecting them.
Two intersecting sets of these spirals, the contact parastichies, are usually conspicuous to the

eye, owing to the fact that each primordium touches certain others; because of these con-
tacts the eye tends to select these particular sets and to ignore the other spirals which
traverse primordia not in contact with one another. Nevertheless, the inconspicuous curves
have just as much, or just as little, objective reality as the conspicuous contact parastichies,
which are simply a particular pair of sets from among the whole family of logarithmic
spirals. These curves then are all parastichies.

The numbers of contact parastichies can readily be counted in a transverse section of an
apex, and typically give an adjoining pair of numbers from the Fibonacci series, e.g. five
curves running round the apex in one direction may intersect eight others spiralling in the
opposite direction. Such arrangements Church classified by these numbers of intersecting
contact parastichies; the example just given would be designated (5 +8), the numbers being
connected by a plus sign and bracketed together.
