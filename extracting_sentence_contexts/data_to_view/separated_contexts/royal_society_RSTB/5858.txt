Put in other words, the median space is
being continually emptied and, to replace this, water is drawn from the surrounding
region. Its only entrance is between the distal ends of the limbs, but the median space
extends right up to the ventral body wall at the proximal end of the limbs. Now
suction occurs throughout this length, and in fact, as I shall show later (p. 275), is at
a maximum near the body wall. Hence, of the water entering the median space, some
will be sucked into the inter-limb spaces at once near the distal ends of the limbs
fig. 1, inter-limb space 10-11, but the bulk will pass towards the ventral body wall
before being sucked away, fig. 1, inter-limb space 6-7. There is thus in the median
space a definite movement of water towards the mid-ventral line.
