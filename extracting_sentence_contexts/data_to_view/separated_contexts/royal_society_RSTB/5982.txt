Next, there is the fact that in the develop-
ment of the skull in Selachians, the notochordal sheath is invaded by the cartilage
cells of the parachordal from its hinder edge to a point opposite the middle of the
auditory capsules (vAN WIsJHE, 1922; DE Breer, 1931, a). Invasion of the sheath of
the notochord is a typical vertebral phenomenon, and that it should not occur in the
anterior region of the basal plate is evidence of the non-vertebral nature of this region. Lastly, there is the fact that in almost all vertebrates (Anura and Dipnoi are the only
exceptions) a basicranial fenestra is present, 7.e., the anterior portions of the para-
chordals are entirely free from the notochord, and separated from it by a more or less
wide space, which again is totally different from the conditions of formation of vertebral
centra. It is difficult to estimate the extent of the region occupied by the basicrania]
fenestra, or in which in Selachians the notochordal sheath is not invaded, but it would
not be extravagant to assume that it corresponds to the first 4 segments. The conclusion which we have reached is of interest from the historical as well as
from the theoretical point of view.
