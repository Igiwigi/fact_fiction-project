OGILVIE ON THE MICROSCOPIC AND

individuality of the “dark lines,” representing, in my estimation, the axes of isolated
trabecular parts. Thus interpreted, the Palmwozoic genus Hndophyllum would present
an antetype of the arrangement of trabecular growth-parts in the Eupsammide. It
is, in fact, a type in which the septal spines tend to a serial arrangement, although
they show in certain regions the irregularity of the Cystiphyllid septal spines. All those figures given by Professor Frecu show no signs of structure other than
the presence of darker rods in the midst of a lighter-toned substance. Calcareous
fibres are nowhere figured.’ At the same time Professor FRecu is perfectly justified
in drawing the following conclusion (“ Zeitschr.,” 1885, p. 934) :—* In Phallipsastrea,
Haplotheeia, Cyathophyllum, and many others, the septa appear to be built up
essentially on the same plan as the living corais with, however, the variation, that
originally a greater nurmber of septal spines (= “dark rods,” in figures) are indepen-
dently laid down and afterwards bound together by differently-formed Stereoplasm.”
