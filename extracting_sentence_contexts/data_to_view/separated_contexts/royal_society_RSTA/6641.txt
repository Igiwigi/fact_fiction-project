Extrapolation to the melting-point gives a value of Lj in good
agreement with that obtained calorimetrically by Spaght, Thomas & Parks (1932), but
higher than the other values recorded in the literature. The difference in specific heats
between liquid and solid diphenyl] at the melting-point which can be obtained from figure 12
agrees with the value 8-7 cal./deg./mole obtained by Spaght e¢ al. (1932). The fact that the
values of aj obtained by Warner et al. are higher than ours, in spite of the agreement on X},
arises from the fact that they have used a lower value of Lj in their calculations.

Thermodynamics of saturated solutions

The variation of the vapour pressure of saturated solutions with temperature has been
considered previously by Bronsted (1937), Findlay (1938), and in more detail by Korvezee
(1934, 1947). The relation between the saturation vapour pressure P. and temperature T
is given approximately by combining Raoult’s law with the approximate equation for the
ideal solubility of the solute D in the solvent B, viz.
