skew-symmetry on % is replaced by even-symmetry on % and the similar reduction to a scalar [5

5. Coefficient of transmission and reflection iB

In the presence of incident surface wave, i.e. (3.2) or (3.3), the surface waves are also reflected ZR
and transmitted (surface waves that are allowed behind the crack tip are related to z;), the same [3
contributing? to )°; ux,yli for x < 0 as well, besides the continuation (due to the way the scattered :sS
field is defined in this paper) of the incident surface waves for x > 0. At this point, recall remark :8
4.1. Note that the incident surface wave satisfies (4.8) with z= z;, so that according to (4.7), £ :3
has a zero at 2, and using |z;| < 1, £+(+z;) =0. In fact, £ (4.7) possesses a simple zero at all four Ss
points tz corresponding to the surface waves on crack faces. Thus, the term (z + zi) 1X(z) in the
expression of solution (4.13) contains both poles corresponding to the incident surface wave (|zj| <

1) and the two reflected surface waves (| + 2; yy > 1as zeros of £_(z)). With the details omitted (see
