long-range elasticity propagating in a random medium, giving t = 1.25, a =1.43 and § =0.58
(see [15-17,46,48,57,58] and references therein). Moreover, it is important to note that the values of
those exponents characterizing the scaling behaviour of the global avalanches are different when
considering local crack front bursts [12,48]. Our new experimental results clearly confirm that
high local velocity clusters and global avalanches measured on crackling time series are different
observables with different statistical properties, as already reported in numerical simulations
[46,48], and in imbibition experiments [23,55,56]. Finally, we can also remark that those scaling
exponents are also different from those reported for a three-dimensional crack front propagating
in a bulk artificial rock [59]. This could suggest that the fracture of three-dimensional solids may
not be simply reduced to a two-dimensional depinning problem. However, the scaling exponents.
reported in [59] evolve with the driving velocity, in strong contrast to our measurements, leading
to robust scaling exponent values, for different loading conditions, with very different average
crack front velocities. Therefore, this discrepancy might simply arise from the fact that the
quasi-static assumption of the depinning model is not satisfied in those experiments.

To further characterize the statistics of these avalanches, we also examine their maximum
amplitudes measured by Vmax, where we have renormalized the crackling noise signal by the
average crack front velocity value, ie. Vi(t)/(v), to compare experiments performed at very
different average velocities. Figure 6 shows the distributions of the maximum amplitudes of
avalanches measured for the same dataset analysed previously (figure 5), e.g. five different
experiments with very different average crack front velocities, and for each experiments N = 16
different crackling noise signals (averaged velocity V/(f), measured at length scales | =L/16)
were computed changing systematically the threshold values C = [—0.3, —0.1,0,0.2,0.5, 0.8, 1.2].
