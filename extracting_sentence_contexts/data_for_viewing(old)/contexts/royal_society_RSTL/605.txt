cold bodies, from which the calorific and frigoritic rays pro-
ceeded, were at the same relative distances.

From these experiments, which I lately repeated at Geneva,
in the presence of Professor PicTer, Mons. de SaussuRE, M.
SENEBIER, and several other persons, we may venture to con-
clude, that, at equal intervals of temperature, the rays which
generate cold, are just as real, and justas intense, as those which
generate heat; or, that their actions are equally powerful, in
changing the temperatures of neighbouring bodies,

On a $uperficial view of this subject, it might appear extraor-
dinary, that 80 important a fact as that of the frigorific radiations

calorific radiations of hot bodies have been so well known ; but,
if we consider the matter with attention, our surprise will cease.
Those radiations by means of which the temperatures of neigh-
bouring bodies are gradually changed and equalized, are not
sensible to our feeling, unless the intervals of temperature be
very considerable; and the constitution of things is such, that
while we are often exposed to the influence of bodies heated
