Art. (g.) I have found that the coefficients of the n factors of fu in the expression
above given for the quotients possess the property that the sum of their square roots
taken with the proper signs is zero for each quotient except the first (the coefficients
for the first being all units), i. e, D/, +D/jh,+...D;/,=0 for all values of i except i=1.
