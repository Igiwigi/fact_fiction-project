I have at present been unable to find any
general condition among the moments, which would be impossible for a skew curve
and possible for a compound, and so indicate compoundedness. I do not, however,
despair of one being found. It is a fact, possibly of some significance, that the best
fitting skew curve to several compound curves that I have tested is a curve of
Type L, and not that of Type IV. which appears to be the more usual type in
biological statistics, Taking, as an example, the statistics for the “foreheads” of Naples
crabs due to Professor WxELpon, and resolved into their components in my memoir,

‘Phil. Trans.’
