better investigate the fidelity change [7], also known as fidelity susceptibility in condensed-matter
literature [12,13], defined by
1 — f(A, 5a)

(64)
For most of the spectra so far encountered in practice, as long as 54 « 1, S,, turned out to be largely
independent of 6, i.e. $,(A, 6A) © S,(A), and vanishingly small except in the vicinity of an avoided
level crossing. The independence of 6A follows in the limit 64 — 0 directly from perturbation
theory.

The independence of 64 has a simple origin, namely that the first non-vanishing contribution
to fy in the perturbation expansion of the changed state |n(4 + 6A)) is of second order in 4A, a
well-known fact from quantum perturbation theory. The fidelity measure (2.1) and the fidelity

Su(, 5A) = (2.2)


susceptibility (2.2) have found a nice application in the characterization of ground states of
quantum many-body systems [12-18]. The fidelity susceptibility S,, detects qualitative changes
in the ground state very well, when they are connected to an avoided level crossing. Since most
quantum phase transitions in finite systems are characterized by a gap, Sy acts as an effective
detector of these transitions and one can check its scaling with the system size, for instance, to
pin down the interesting parameter value at which the transitions occur. Our definition above
generalizes the utility of S, to gaps, e.g. avoided crossings, lying anywhere in the spectrum.
