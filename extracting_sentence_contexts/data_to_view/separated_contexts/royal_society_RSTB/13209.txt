However, the range of DNA methylation differences pendently of any DNA sequence change in cis or in trans,
associated with natural variation at these genes is more limited thus representing bona fide natural epialleles. However,
compared with that achieved using experimental knockout the natural counterparts of ddm1- or nrpd1-induced epialleles
(KO) mutants [59]. In fact, the reduction of mCHH explained are presumably not generated through genetic deficiencies
by the derived alleles of NRPE1 at RdDM-targeted TE that cause strong and widespread DNA methylation loss,
sequences resembles that of experimentally generated hypo- because such deficiencies become rapidly non-viable upon
morphic alleles with similar sequence defects [54]. In turn, repeated selfing (e.g. [63,64]). Indeed, ddm1 deficiencies or
these observations suggest that severe and widespread loss null nrpd1 alleles have not been observed in nature.
