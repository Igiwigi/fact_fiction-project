CONTINUOUS ELECTRIC CALORIMETRY. 141

(46.) Empirical Formule.

The usual method of representing the results of a series of observations like the
present is to adopt an empirical formula of the type,

s=1+ai+ bP +e +dtit+&k&e, . ... . . (8),

and to calculate the values of the coefficients a, b, c, d, &e., by the method of least
squares. This was, in fact, the method adopted by Liipry. ‘It has the advantage of
providing a simple and ready rule, which is very generally recognized and applied ;
but it appears to me that it is in reality liable to several objections. Too much
weight is given to the observations at higher temperatures, which are necessarily less
accurate than the rest. The results obtained are in a great measure dependent on
the particular type of formula assumed, which is frequently inadequate to represent
the phenomenon, and is generally quite unsuitable for extrapolation. Moreover, the
method gives a fictitious appearance of completeness and accuracy, which is quite
2 misleading, as the calculated values of the probable errors contain no reference to
possible sources of constant error. It also generally happens that the terms of the
empirical formula are large and of alternate sign, so that the small variation required
is given as the difference between large quantities, which must be calculated to
® several figures in applying the formula. The following formula of Lipry supplies a
