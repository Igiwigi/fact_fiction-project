gree noxious ; therm. 80%. After a very few turns of the re-
volving plate, the doubler became electrified negatively : I
immediately set the door and windows wide open, and another
door which opens over a bow window, to let in fresh air ; but
the wind blowing moderately strong from the east, and the
bow window door being at the north end, and the windows at
the south end of the garret, made it unfavourable for an east
wind to drive through it, therefore its electric state remained
the same in kind after they had been opened, as when $hut;
for I examined it at several intervals.of time : yet the state
of the air became thereby considerably better to breathe in.
These facts will appear still more extraordinary, wien we
consider that the general state of atmospheric electricity at
the time of performing these experiments was of the po-
sitive kind, as appeared ty the doub er when placed on the
wood hand-rail of the bow window, which is cn y three

wind been north or south, it would have passed through the
garret with force, and would, no doubt, have changed by re-
gular gradation its electricity to positive; a fact that I have
