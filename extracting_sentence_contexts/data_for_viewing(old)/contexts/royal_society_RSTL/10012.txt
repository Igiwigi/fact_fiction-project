E power of summing up the effects of two, three, or more impulses 80 as to produce a

Sto sum up the effects of a series of stimuli which follow one another 80 closely as to
Zdegerve the title of a continuous rather than a discontinuous stimulation. Tf, then, we
:Z2 have reason to snppose that in the firs+ case the discontinuons stimuli ultimately

ZCase We May SUPPOSE that a continuous stimulation causes a rhythmical series of con-
'S fractions by acting in the same way. The difference between the two cases would
Zeconsisb in the extent to which the excitability was increased ; in the one, the muscle
Sis not rendered sufficiently excitable to contract without the assistance of a distinct
Z separate stimulus ; in the other, the excitability is increased 80 much that no separate
Stimulus is required : the muscle, in fact, can be spoken of as capable of spontaneous
E contraction.

VS ON THe ACTION OF THE VAGUs NERVE.

E Ever since the brothers WEBtr discovered that stimulation of the vagus nerve

S cansed the heart to stand till, physiologists have been incessantly endeavouring to
discover the reason of this standstill, with the result that an enormous mass of facts
in connexion with the action of the nerve has been accumulated, and a variety of
hypotheses have been snggested to explain these facts.
