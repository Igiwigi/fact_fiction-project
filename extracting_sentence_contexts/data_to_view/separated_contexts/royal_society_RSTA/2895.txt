Or in the algorithmic examples that we are considering, where the discretion
has been delegated to the algorithm, and no genuine or conscious choice is being made by the
public authority.

(b) The role of the human in an algorithm-assisted discretionary decision? An algorithm has the potential always to be more accurate than a human when circumstances

are identical to those for which the algorithm was developed, and in relation to that specific task
or question for which the algorithm was designed (although accuracy levels may not present the =
full picture in circumstances where data uncertainty is not represented [41] or where there is no : S
appetite for double-blind testing, in respect of serious offenders for instance: see Kleinberg et al.’s : 2
[53] work on comparing judicial bail decisions with an algorithmic one where crime outcomes can anal
only be observed for released defendants). Grove and Meehl argue that ‘if an equation predicts : _
that Jones will do well in dental school, and the dean’s committee, looking at the same set of facts, : 3
predicts that Jones will do poorly, it would be absurd to say, “The methods don’t compete, we Dh
use both of them”. One cannot decide both to admit and to reject the applicant; one is forced by 3
the pragmatic context to do one or the other’ [5]. It is hard to take issue with this.
