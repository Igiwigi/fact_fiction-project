Â© This mean value agrees very closely with that found from the experiments with chlorine
Andilated with air, but it is seen that the variation in the separate values is not incon-
Kderable. 'The cause of this lies not only in the unavoidable errors of experiment, but
More especially in the fact that the formula used in the calculation is, strictly speaking,
Saly applicable to homogeneous light, whilst the chemically active rays emanating from
"Hur coal-gas flame were certainly not all of the same degree of refrangibility. 2 If the intensity I, of the light, measured by our instrament, were composed of the
Tomponents I, +I, +... of various degrees of refrangibility, the formula T=1,10-%* would
