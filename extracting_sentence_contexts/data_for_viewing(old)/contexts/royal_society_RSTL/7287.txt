8uccession, it, is possible to determine « as a function of them, and to predict the pro-
gress of the chemical change of a single substance, from its commencement to its com-

Epletion, under any assignable conditions.
S This simple case of chemical change is of comparatively rare occurrence. 'Two
Snstances of it are recorded in the preceding pages (pp. 209 & 210, n=3). It isnecessary
herefore to investigate the modifications which the general law undergoes in the case
=of complex reactions.
© Tet us first take the case in which the chemical change consists of the reaction of two
Substances, neither of which is present in the system in great excess. In the discussion
By this case we shall assume the general truth of the law of variation of the rate of
Fhemical action, which has been derived from experiments in which the constancy of
Dull the elements but one has been secured by taking them in excess. In fact we shall
Sz5ume that the truth of the law depends only upon the constancy of the elements, and
"not upon their excess. Since, then, the velocity of change of each substance is propor-
Aional to its quantity when the quantity of the other is constant, it follows that the
Jolocity of change is proportional to the product of the quantities when both vary.
Let a, b be the number of equivalents of the substances present in the system at the
Srommencement of the reaction, 2 the number of equivalents of each which has disap-
"Speared during a time a, then a—z, 6—2 are the number of equivalents remaining at the
Zend of that time; hence
