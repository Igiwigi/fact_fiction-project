is p=0. Now since the polar line of O passes

through O', then the polar conic of O' passes
through O; but this conic intersects the line L
in two points, and the line joining O' to each of
them is a tangent to Aj, Hence from any point

of the line CN can in general two tangents be

drawn to A; and we shall scee immediately that ON itself is a tangent. This agrees
with the fact of the curve being of the third class. Let the polar conic of C intersect
CL in the points Q, Q', then the lines CQ, CQ! are tangents to A; ; in other words, CL is
a double tangent, and it is plain that Q, Q' are its points of contact. Again, let the
polar line of C intersect ON in H, then HW is a point of contact, 80 that ON is a tangent.

11. Since the point O' moves on CN, its polar conic will pass through four fixed
points, namely, the four poles of ON with respect to U. Hence any line will be cut in
involution by the polar conics of the points O'; and we have the following theorem :—
1f from any three points in ON three pairs of tangents be drawn to Az, these will meet
its double tangent in siz points in involution, and the two points of contact of the double
tangent belong to the involution.

12. We find the limiting points of the involution as follows :—Let the pole conic of
