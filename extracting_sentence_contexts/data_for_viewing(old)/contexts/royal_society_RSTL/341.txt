Z g. A chymist, whose notions of iron are derived principally
From books, and from the phznomena which are presented
Sy processes not having metallurgy for their immediate ob-
ct, will be apt to consider some things related above as in-
-Sonsistent : the violence of the heat, for instance, and the
3mallness of its effects; since even cast iron was not fused in
All the experiments. The fact is, when cast iron exposes a
Jarge surface, and heat is gradually applied, it proves almost as
Zn≈øfusible as malleable iron : indeed, by the gradual action of
Heat it is converted, superficially at -least, into malleable iron,
Tr approximates towards it: and considering only iron and
Sharcoal, I believe, the fusibility of iron will be directly as the
Tyuantity of charcoal it contains. Now'in the experiments I have
Aescribed, pieces of one, two, and three drachms, and sometimes
less, were used; for larger could not be inserted into the neck
of the retort. And,'in order to avoid this inconvenience in
future, I would recommend cylinders to be cast, of a diameter
