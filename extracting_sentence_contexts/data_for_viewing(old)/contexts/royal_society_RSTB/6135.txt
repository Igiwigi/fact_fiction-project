but a considerable division of the constrictor anterior is attached to the process. In
Rana greyi, R. kuhlii and R. limnocharis, and also in a young specimen of R. mas-
careniensis, neither muscle is inserted on the process and the larynx-musculature is
quite generalized. In R. greyi and R. kuhlii, however, the outer attachment of the
dilatator extends on to the hyo-cricoid ligament.

Krause (1920) calls the aryteno-cricoid slip of the dilatator ““ M. arylabialis” and
traces it as a fibrous strip into the pars basalis of the vocal cord. A similar muscle is
present in Pseudopaludicola falcipes (p. 432), and, in Megalophrys robusta, what corre-
sponds to a hyo-cricoid slip of the dilatator ends on the membranous wall of the
larynx between arytenoid and cricoid ; so that it is now clear that such a specialization
of the dilatator is neither confined to Rana, nor is it universally present in the genus.
The Ranide, in fact, possess a generalized larynx, the only characteristic feature of
which, the apical cartilage, is shared with the related families of the Rhacophoride and
Brevicipitide.

The shape of the cricoid exhibits some diversity within the genus Rana. The most
usual shape is that found in R. temporaria, R. kuhlii, R. halecina, etc., in which the
muscular process is a triangular eminence. Frazier shows it also in her R. limnocharis
(1924, fig. 2), but this differs so much from my specimens of this species that it is
probable that her specimen was wrongly identified. In my specimens of R. limnocharis
the cricoid exhibits laterally a deep, narrow notch, instead of a process, and a shallower
notch is present in R. fuscigula. In R. nigromaculata (Frazmr, tom. cit., fig. 4) the
notch is shallow but is delimited by slender dorsal and ventral prominences. The
presence of a notch is probably the most primitive condition, and was shown by
