capillaris.

2. ‘The rods and cones are chiefly nourished by the choriocapillaris, but in a very
slight degree by the retinal vessels.

3. In the same way the outer nuclear layer receives its supply, but to a more
marked degree, fiom the retinal vessels (capillaries).

1, The remaining layers of the retina are nourished by the retinal vessels alone.
The external layers of the retina are nourished by osmosis, the choriocapillaris
acting merely in a vicarious manner for the retinal vessels.

The important fact is that the retina is nourished from two sources, the outer
layers still by the choroid, the inner exclusively by the special retinal vessels. In
this respect I quite agree with ScHNELLER ; only with regard to the actual extent of
the vessels into the retina I have to make an additional statement. In Man and a
number of other Primates (Troglodytes niger, Cercopithecus mona, Macacus rhesus,
Cynocephalus hamadryas, Galago maholi), as well as in some of the Ungulates (Horse,
Sheep, and Ox), Carnivores (Dogs and Cats), and Rodents (Rats, Mice, Rabbits, and
Guinea-pigs), all the retinee of which I have examined microscopically, I have found
invariably that no blood-vessels are observable external to, i.¢., beyond, the outer
molecular layer. The large vessels lie exclusively in the nerve fibre layer, and the
ganglion cell layer. Immediately the inner molecular layer is passed we come to a
