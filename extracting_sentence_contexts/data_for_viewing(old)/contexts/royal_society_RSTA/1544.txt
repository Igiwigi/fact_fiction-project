computational science: implementing
verification, validation and uncertainty

quantification in silico’. The objectivity of science is its crowning and distin-

guishing feature. Its stock-in-trade are experimental facts,
Subject Areas: observations and theories which do not depend on who
computer modelling and simulation, reports them but rather on the notion that the same
computational physics, computational findings would be obtained by anyone else performing
chemistry similar procedures. This is what is meant by scientific

reproducibility. That, at least, is the aspiration. In
practice, things are often less clear cut. Theories are built

Keywords: on observations and experimental data. They involve
computational science, computer science, a process of logical thought based on mathematical
reproducibility, validation, verification, methods. These can sometimes be found to be in
uncertainty quantification error because the empirical data they depend on are
