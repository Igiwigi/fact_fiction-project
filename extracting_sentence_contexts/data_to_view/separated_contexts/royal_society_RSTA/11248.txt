Thus the card of each
sire had the letters a, b, c, d, e, &e., upon it, and a frequency distribution was formed
Eon the card of each sive for the fecundity of his daughters.
& The same thing was done for the sires’ sires ; only here recourse had again to be
sghad to the stud-books to obtain the fecundity of the daughters of the more ancient
Ssires. Finally, a sire-alphabet was obtained which gave the average fertility of the
ia aphicrs of a sire and of the daughters of his sire, or his half-sisters, On these
cards was also placed the number of mares upon which each average was based. These two card-alphabets, the mare and sire alphabets, form the “dressed ”

material upon which all the subsequent calculations were based.

(14.) At this point it seems desirable to insist somewhat on the many causes which
tend to make the fecundity of mares, as thus determined, to a considerable extent
fictitious. Many of these were only apparent to me as I became more and more
familiar with the material.

* Ivish mares were excluded except where, for pedigree purposes, it was necessary to deal with them. Many Irish mares were further included when it came to the valuation of the fertility of mares due to
a given sire.
