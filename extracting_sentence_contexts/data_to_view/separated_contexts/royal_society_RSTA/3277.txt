Within the trunk of the tree and its branches and roots,
there are fibre vessel elements, which in the living
tissues transport nutrients and water. In processes such
as papermaking, these vessel elements are extracted
and we typically then call them ‘fibres’. In fact, such
fibres possess a layered structure of fibrils, embedded
in other plant polysaccharides, and binding materials
such as hemicelluloses, lignin, pectins and waxes. These
fibrils, or cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs), can be extracted
from the cell walls of the fibres through mechanical
and/or chemical/enzymatic approaches. They represent
not only a truly sustainable resource but also a functional
material.
