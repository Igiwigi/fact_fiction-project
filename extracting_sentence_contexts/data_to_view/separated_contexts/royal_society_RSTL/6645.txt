gen of the decomposing nitrogenous body. Or, if it did act upon the latter in p
to the former, there would either be no free Nitrogen finally evolved, or, in case of
trogen being lost in the free state, it would be obvious that there had been less n;
Nitrogen converted into ammonia than had been liberated from its combinations,
hence that, as a resultant, there would be a loss and not a gain of combined Ny
due to the decomposition. 'The fact that, in our experiments upon the gas evolved by vegetable matters in a
of decompoxition, both free Nitrogen and free hydrogen were given off, bears
upon this question. The Nitrogen evolved has been. in most intimate contact, with
hydrogen given off.
