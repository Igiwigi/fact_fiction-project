The positive sign will refer to one side of the cut, and the negative sign to
the other. The easiest way to determine which sign is positive is to write € = px,, and consider
the cases p21. The facts that x, = (s—ic)/a, and #(A,) must be positive, lead to the con-
clusion that 4 (A,) must be positive on the left of the cut, and negative on the right, as in
figure 10a. Then since € = /(x2—u?), Cd udu, we get

Approximating to ¢ in the denominator by «,, and in the exponent by «, —u?/2k,,

and the contour I’, has the form shown in figure 105. We find that #(A,) must be negative
on the left of the cut and positive on the right, and with the same substitutions as before
