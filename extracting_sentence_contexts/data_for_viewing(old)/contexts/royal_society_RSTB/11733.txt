were asked to estimate the colour diversity in either the cued
or an uncued row. It was shown that participants are able to
report about the colour diversity outside the cued row without
expense with regard to the ability to correctly report the letters
in the cued row. Arguably, the finding shows that colour
diversity judgements do not involve any working memory
load, and, thus, represent phenomenal consciousness without
access consciousness.

The finding can be interpreted in different ways and more
experiments are needed in order to conclude that phenom-
enal consciousness may indeed overflow working memory
content. Regardless, however, given the very fact that differ-
ent empirical hypotheses can be raised for different
interpretations of access, it is worthwhile to look into the
consequences hereof for a theoretical understanding of the
general relation between consciousness and varieties of
cognitive access. How are we to understand that it is con-
ceivable that there may be conscious experience without
the experienced content being represented in working
memoryâ€”yet still being available for action or speech?

In the present communication, we focus on the neuro-
cognitive framework known as the REF (reorganization of
elementary functions) framework. One reason for doing so is
