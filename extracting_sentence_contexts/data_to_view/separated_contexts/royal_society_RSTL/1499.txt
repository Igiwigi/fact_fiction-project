This increased elongation of the fibres and vessels of the
under side is not confined to the germens, nor even to the
annual shoots of trees, but occurs and produces the most ex-
tensive effects in the subsequent growth of their trunks and
branches. The immediate effect of gravitation is certainly to
occasion the further depression of every branch, which extends
horizontally from the trunk of the tree; and, when a young
tree inclines to either side, to increase that inclination : but it
at the same time, attracts the sap to the under side, and thus
occasions an increased longitudinal extension of the substance
of the new wood on that side.* The depression of the lateral
branch is thus prevented ; and it is even enabled to raise itself
above its natural level, when the branches above it are
removed ; and the young tree, by the same means, becomes
more upright, in direct opposition to the immediate action of
gravitation : nature, as usual, executing the most important
operations by the most simple means. I could adduce many more facts in support of the preceding
deductions, but those I have stated, I conceive to be suffi-
ciently conclusive. It has however been objected by Du
Har, (and the greatest deference is always due to his
opinions,) that gravitation could have little influence on
the direction of the germen, were it in the first instance
protruded, or were it subsequently inverted, and made to

* This effect does not appear to be produced in what are called weeping trees ;
the cause of which I have endeavoured to point out in a former Memoir. Phil.
