If Lorentz invariance is
not satisfied, CPT can be violated in unitary theories. This may be important if one wants to find
theories where matter and antimatter have different properties. Finally, the equivalence principle, the fact that all interactions of the SM fields with charges
related to the energy-momentum tensor are universal, is a foundational assumption of General
Relativity. It is tested to hold to a high accuracy [24]. But it is easily violated in extensions of
General Relativity with extra fields, so there are no fundamental reasons to consider it as sacred.
