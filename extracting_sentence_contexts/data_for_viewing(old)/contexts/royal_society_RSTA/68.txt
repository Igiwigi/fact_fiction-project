Schmeidler [7] introduced a notion of non-cooperative equilibrium in games with a continuum
of agents, having in mind such diverse applications as elections, many small buyers from
a few competing firms and drivers that can choose among several roads. Mas-Colell [8]
reformulated Schmeidler’s analysis in a framework that presents great analogies with the
Monge-Kantorovich optimal transport problem. Indeed, in Mas-Colell’s formulation, players
are characterized by some type (productivity, tastes, wealth, geographical position, etc.), whose
probability distribution y is given. Each agent has to choose a strategy so as to minimize a cost
that not only depends on her type, but also on the probability distribution of strategies resulting
from the behaviour of the rest of the population. A Cournot—Nash equilibrium then is a joint
probability distribution of types and strategies with first marginal (given) and second marginal
v (unknown) that is concentrated on cost-minimizing strategies. The difficulty of the problem lies
in the fact that the cost depends on v. For relevant applications, this dependence can be quite
complex, because there may be both attractive (mimetism) and repulsive (congestion) effects in
the cost.

Another situation where one looks for joint probabilities (or couplings) is the optimal
transport problem of Monge-Kantorovich. In the Monge-Kantorovich problem, one is given two
probability spaces (@,,) and (X,v), and a transport cost c, and one looks for the cheapest way
to transport jz to v for the cost c. In Monge’s original formulation, one looks for a transport T
between yz and v, i.e. a measurable map from © to X such that Ty =v, where Ty denotes the
image of ju by T, i.e.

Tyu(B) = u(T~\(B)), VB CX measurable
