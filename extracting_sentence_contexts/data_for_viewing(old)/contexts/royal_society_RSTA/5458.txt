Einsteinâ€™s theory that he was biased in his analysis of the Principe and Sobral
lates, discarding discrepant data (Waller 2002). At Principe, only two plates
were successfully exposed with an astrograph, giving a mean deflection of 1.61 +
0.30 arcsec. At Sobral, more plates were taken with a similar astrograph, giving
a smaller deflection of approximately 0.93 arcsec. Use of a second telescope at
Sobral gave a deflection of 1.90 + 0.11 arcsec. It has been argued that Eddington
dispensed unnecessarily with the discrepant Sobral astrograph results to force
agreement with Einstein.

A recent re-analysis (Kennefick in press) shows that this was not the case.
The Sobral astrograph plates were out of focus as a result of the rapid change
in temperature during totality. This meant that it proved very difficult to
establish a proper plate scale. In fact, it was Dyson who discarded these results.

His subsequent, more careful, analysis of these plates after publication gave
a deflection of 1.52arcsec. In 1979, the Sobral plates were more accurately
