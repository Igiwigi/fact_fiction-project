early stimulative action of the venom, and

(5) Exhaustion of the heart is probably predisposed to by the strain put upon the
organ, in having to work for a long period against an abnormally high blood pressure.

We are now in a position to explain the sudden rapid fall of the curves of heart-
beat-rate and of blood pressure, which usher in death at the close of one of these
long experiments. An over-strained and weakened heart is suddenly and violently
called upon to bear a farther burden, for respiration has ceased and the medullary
centres are acutely asphyxiated. As a consequence there is a violent excitation ot
the cardio-inhibitory and vaso-motor mechanisms. The heart is slowed and at the
same time has to work against a suddenly increased pressure, and it gives way. In
fact, we have the phenomena of asphyxiation in their entirety.

The vessels of the splanchnic area are affected par passw with those of the body
generally, and they in no wise act independently. The vaso-motor mechanism
remains active throughout, and is as we have seen profoundly affected by changes in
the venosity of the blood.

(6) Cobra venom when injected in large doses, and especially when given intra-
venously, causes (1) a sudden fall of blood pressure ; (2) a subsequent rise, provided
the dose has not been too large ; and (8) a final fall to zero.

The early fall is undoubtedly due to inhibition of the heart. It has been clearly
