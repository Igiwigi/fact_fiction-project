The investigations contained in my two preceding memoirs
were, in fact, commenced under the impression that the solution of this problem of
the precession and nutation of the earth's axis on the hypothesis of the interior fluidity
of the earth, would probably lead to results different from those which had been long
before obtained on the supposition of the earth's entire solidity. This impression was
founded on the consideration of the great difference between the direct action of a
force on a solid, and that on a fluid mass, in its tendency to produce rotatory mo-
tion. We have een, in fact, that the disturbing forces of the sun and moon do not
tend to produce directly any motion in the interior fluid, in which the rotatory motion
causing precession and nutation, is produced indirectly by the effect of the above
forces on the position of the solid shell. A modification is thus produced in the effects
of the centrifugal force, which (as appears from the results of our investigations)
compensates for the want of any direct effect from the action of the disturbing forces. This compensation will scarcely, perhaps, be deemed less curious than many of those
which have been recognized in the solar system, and by which, amidst apparently con-
flicting causes, its harmony and permanency are $0 beautifully preserved.
