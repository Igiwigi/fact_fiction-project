Second and third cuneiform, is only a question of time, the modification going on unin-
terruptedly in the direction of the greater reduction of the limb-bones. Can the general tendency of this steady reduction be doubtful? I6.nok the fact
eloquent enough, that, proceeding from the middle Miocene times until the recent
period, we meet with a whole series of Suina in which the skeleton is gradually more and
more reduced, until it culminates in the Post-tertiary time in Dicotyles, a form yery
analogous, in the structure of its limbs, to the Ruminants, whose middle digits are quite
auy'ts coalesce into a cannonbone, and the laterals to drop off? Indeed, this has begun
in the posterior limb, in which reduction is always in advance, and on its outer side, which
is generally more reduced than the inner. If any inference from one series of pheno-
mena is allowed to be applied to another, then, inasmuch as the Paridigitata with cREs-
CENTIC TEETH, or the recent Ruminantia, proceeding from tetra- or even pentadactyle
forms, arrived in the Miocene period at didactyle forms, in which the coalescence of
the two middle digits simulates monodactylity, we have a full right to infer, seeing
the parallelism of these two groups, that the Paridigitata with TUBERCULAR TEETH
have followed just the same line of reduction.
