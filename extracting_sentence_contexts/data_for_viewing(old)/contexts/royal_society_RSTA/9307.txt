The third small table shows that the average and maximum change of angle for the
ammonium replacement is nearly as much as for the cesium replacement, both being
twice as much approximately as for the replacement of potassium by rubidium.

Cleavage.—The cleavage common to the series, parallel to 7’{201}, is developed, but
is not very facile. There is quite a good cleavage parallel to b {010}, and in this salt this ,
cleavage is undoubtedly the better one of the two. The fact was confirmed on several
erystals of different crops, and excellent images of the signal were obtained from the
cleaved surfaces, at exactly 90 degrees from ¢ faces subsisting on the fragments
