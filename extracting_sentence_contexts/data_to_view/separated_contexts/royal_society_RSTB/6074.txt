Like the stria it has its own nuclear
development. The subthalamus in Echidna differs little from that of other mammals although
the tractus strio-subthalamicus might be considered a peculiarity. The fact that
the ventral nuclei of the medial and lateral geniculate bodies are extensions of the
subthalamus is in accordance with their phylogenetic history. Kapprrs (1921) and
Le Gros Crark (1932, a) have shown that the ventral nucleus of the lateral geniculate
body has evolved from the subthalamus, and the latter author (1933) has shown
that the ventral nucleus of the medial geniculate body has a similar origin. Already
in Echidna this process has been initiated for both nuclei.
