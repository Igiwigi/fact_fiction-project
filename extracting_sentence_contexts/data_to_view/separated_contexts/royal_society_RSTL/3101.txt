To these statements it
may be added, that in many of the inferior animals the foregoing supposed
causes of the venous part of the circulation evidently have no existence, and
that, with the exception of the elasticity of the heart, they have no existence in
the fetal state in any. We have just seen from direct experiment, that the circulation of the blood
goes on as usual when all these canses have wholly ceased to operate. I shall now take a rapid view of the facts which, as far as I am capable of
judging, leave no room of doubt respecting the sources of the power on which
this function depends. It is 80 evident to those in the least acquainted with the animal economy
that the contractile power of the heart is one of the chief of these sources, that
it would be superfluous to enumerate the proofs of it; yet even this position has
been denied, and that by a writer of no mean abilities. The opposite error,
however, is the more common ; and not a few havye ascribed, and even till do
ascribe, the motion of the blood throughont the whole course of circulation to
the contractile power of the heart alone, although it would not be difficult to
prove that to drive the blood through one set of capillary vessels, and still more
through two or three sets of such yessels,—for in man himself, in one important
part of the circulation, it is carried through two, and in some animals through
three, sets of capillaries before it returns to the heart, —lI say it would not be
difficult to prove that to drive it through one set of capillaries, at the rate at
which the blood is known to move, would require a force capable of bursting
any of the vessels.
