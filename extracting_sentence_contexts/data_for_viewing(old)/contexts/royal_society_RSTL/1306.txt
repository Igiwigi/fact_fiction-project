deposited a few flakes of albumen. When evaporated, it af-
forded.saline matter, with excess of acid, (super salts.)

By these experiments it is ascertained, that a low negatiye
power of electricity separates from, the serum of the. blood an.
alkaline solution of albumen ; that a low positive power sepa-
rates albumen with acid, and the salts of the blood. That with
one degree of power, albumen is separated in a, solid form,
with a less degree, it is separated in a fluid form.

From these facts, the following queries are: proposed.

_ 18t. That such, decomposition of the blood by electricity,
may be as near an approach to secretion, as could be expected
to be produced by the artificial means at present- in our
power,

2d. That a weaker power of electricity, than any that can
be readily kept up by art, may be capable of separating from


of animal Secretions. 391
