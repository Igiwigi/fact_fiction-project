37. T have occasionally found long branching hyphe without any‚Äù dilatations, and which,
being associated with the branching ones, I presume belong to the same plant, since
they differ in no respect from the shorter hyphz of the latter. From these facts it
would appear that this organism began as a single spore-like cell within the cells and
vessels of other plants. This cell threw ont from one to three short hyphe, each of
which developed a capsule like an oogonium at its extremity, which, in turn, repeated
the same process until a complex branching structure was produced. But under some
other cireumstances longer branching hyphee, either devoid of oogonia or only bearing
them at much longer intervals, were produced.
