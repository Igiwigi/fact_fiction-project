For example, given a generally ‘favourable’ environment it is
of advantage, for the long-term increase of the species, that all individuals should emerge
without the incidence of diapause. It is clear that increase of the numbers of the species
would be favoured by this. Thus one could postulate that a diet of cane-sugar alone was
favourable to Cryptus even though egg-production of individual females was lowered and
their adult life was considerably less, facts which would indicate that conditions were
definitely unfavourable. Although, in general, it is obvious what is meant by favourable or
unfavourable conditions these terms must be accepted with caution, and both their
immediate and ‘long-term’ effects considered. The possible genetical background that has been postulated in a number of examples of
diapause may now be considered in the light of the above.
