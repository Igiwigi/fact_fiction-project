Finally, we have a theorem on approximation:
TueoreM D*., If xe R*(a,b), then | bx—a|<1
This may be proved by observing that the worst x in the interval #*(a, /) to approximate

are those at the ends, i.e. the medians. It may then be verified that the medians do in fact
satisfy the required inequality.

From Theorem D* we may derive a more general theorem on linear forms:

Tueorem E. Let a, b, c, d be real numbers, ad—be +0. Then there are integers (x,y) 4=(0,0) such
that simultaneously | ax+-by |< | ad—be

:
| ex-+-dy | <,/| ad—be |.
Of course, theorem E is a direct consequence of Minkowski’s theorem on convex regions;
but the generalizations to /(i) and k(p), which we shall discuss later, are not.
In a precisely similar way, if a/b is a reduced fraction of y, we may define the region
