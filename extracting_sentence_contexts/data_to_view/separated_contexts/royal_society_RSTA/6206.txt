The numerical procedure proposed improves
upon existing methods that were used to determine the material constants (;, a) as best-
fit parameters. The authors also found that the correlation between the data and the model
is casual or in some sense, spurious. This is explained by the fact that the Ogden model is
purely phenomenological and does not connect the material constants to mesoscopic quantities
or mechanical features. As shown later by Ogden et al. [17], the curve-fitting procedure of (1.10) is a nonlinear
optimization problem and its solution is not unique for n> 2. Hence, several combinations of


material parameters exist that provide the same level of optimal fitting, but with the predictions
of the corresponding models being quantitatively different, sometimes widely.
