In addition to the spontaneous occurrence of outgrowths, they had, as previously
described, been artificially induced on Hibiscus vitifolius and Ipomea Woodii. Earlier
but unsuccessful experiments had also been made with Solanum tuberosum and Vitis
vinifera, Later and successful experiments showed that the previous failures were

too old. Artificial outgrowths were formed during the Spring of 1901 in the

following plants :—
Solanum tuberosum, Linn.

»  aculeatissimum, Jace.
»  pyracanthum, Jaca.
Vitis vinifera, Linn.
Cassia floribunda, Cav. Desc.

The results obtained with the Potato were even more striking than those previously
obtained with Hibiscus vitifolius, and effectually demonstrate the general truth of
