slow process, and in Prerrer’s ‘ Physiology’ (vol. 1, p. 125 of Eng. Ed.) the idea is
given that the rate of diffusion in a plant cell is too slow to be of much avail for the
transference of soluble materials in the absence of streaming or mixing movements.
Thus, it is stated, that by diffusion alone, it requires a period of 319 days to transfer
a milligramme of salt from a 10-per-cent. solution through a distance of one metre of
water, and unfortunately this impression is strengthened in the English Edition by
the conversion of metre into millimetre (m. into mm.). In any case, either statement
might be correct, since the amount transferred depends also upon the area through
which the transference takes place, which is not given.

If diffusion is slow, then the wood-parenchyma cells would hardly be capable of so
rapid a transference of dissolved material as is required by the foregoing theory. As
a matter of fact, diffusion in small plant cells is not slow, but extremely rapid.
Suppose a broad tube, a metre long, to be half filled with a strong solution of copper
sulphate, and then filled up with water without mixing, it would take more than 10
years before a cubic centimetre at any point of the tube contained approximately the
same amount of copper sulphate. The time required is, however, proportional to the
square of the length of the tube, so that if the latter were 1 centim. long, not more
than 10 hours would be required, while in a plant cell 0°01 centim. long, only 0-001 of
an hour or 3°6 seconds are necessary. This is less than half the time required for the
protoplasm to rotate once round such a cell, whereas in large cells like those of Chara
and Nitella, the protoplasm could pass round the cell from 10 to 200 times during the
time required for the complete diffusion of copper sulphate.

Each substance has its own specific rate of diffusion, which increases with rise of
