This will be taken account of by
supposing / to contain a term quadratic in d. Suppose, now, we compress the air till
its density is (say) doubled. We know as a matter of experimental fact, that the
specific inductive capacity will not thereby be largely altered. This will mean, not
that the quadratic expression in d is but slightly altered in form, but that the equal
expression in dâ€™ is thus slightly altered. Moreover, to express simply the fact of
electric and magnetic isotropy of fluids requires that the independent variables should
be the dashed letters.
