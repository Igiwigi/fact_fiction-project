The application of SERS yielded good results only in one of the three green areas, assigned
to the green earth. However, the Y4-23 spectrum contains bands at 1190, 1289 and 1545 cm!
(figure 9), which may be related to the presence of phthalocyanine green [27]. In fact, the XRF
spectra of this area revealed the occurrence of Cu, also related to this pigment. Both findings
indicate that some phthalocyanine green was probably mixed with the green earth. The identification of copper resinate (Y4-21) and malachite (Y4-22) was achieved only by XRF.
