its possessing qualities totally peculiar and extraordinary. It
is said, that though in its original state easily soluble in water
and wholly insoluble in alcohol and ether, it changes, when
nitric, or oxymuriatic acid is poured into its solution, into a
rTesinous substance no longer soluble in water, but soluble in
alcohol, and this singular alteration is attributed to the union
to it of a small portion of oxygen which it has acquired from
these acids.* Being possessed of some of this substance which
had been sent to me some years ago from Palermo, by the
same person from whom Mr. KLAarroTH had received it, I be-

and have observed facts which appear to warrant a different
