The origin of the tapetum from cells outside the sporogenous group. It will be a matter of interest later to see how far these characters are absolute
and distinctive. There are, in fact, certain ferns (Gleicheniacese, Osmundaceze, and
Schizzeaceze) which provide important material for comparison, and they show that
the Marattiaceous type is not so isolated among ferns as it is often assumed to be. Nores on Fossin MARAtTriaAce&Â® AND ALLIED Forms. Having now seen that, though differing in certain features of the mature sorus, the
four genera of living Marattiaceze conform to one type as regards their development,
and so would appear to constitute a very natural family, we may turn to the consider-
ation of allied fossils.
