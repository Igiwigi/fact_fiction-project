On the other hand, it has been proved in my previous researches upon hydrocarbon
combustion : (1) that in slow combustion in borosilicate glass bulbs at temperatures
between 300° C. and 400° C., methane, ethane, ethylene and acetylene are all oxidised
at a much faster rate than is either hydrogen or carbon monoxide,* and (2) that on
exploding such mixtures as C,H,+H,+0O, or C,H,+2H,+0,, the hydrocarbon is
burnt in preference to hydrogen,t facts which are at variance with LANport’s
conclusion.

The possibility of deducing from our bomb experiments a direct comparison between
the relative affinities of methane and hydrogen in explosions arose from the fact that
the primary oxidation of methane involves a direct transition from CH,+0, to
CH,OH),, which latter breaks up into, ultimately, CO+H,+H,0, without any
deposition of carbon. Whence it follows that if mixtures, CH,+O,+aH,, be exploded,
the division of the oxygen between the methane and hydrogen during the extremely
short period of actual combustion (¢.e., direct oxidation) may be deduced from the
proportion of the original methane found intact in the final products, provided always
that there is no separation of carbon, which in fact is never observéd in such
circumstances.

The experimental method consisted, therefore, in exploding a series of mixtures
CH,+0,+H,, in which the hydrocarbon and oxygen were initially present in as
nearly as possible equimolecular proportions, but in which a (the volume ratio of H,
