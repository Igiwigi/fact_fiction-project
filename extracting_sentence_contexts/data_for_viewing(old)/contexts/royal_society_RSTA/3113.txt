make a moment truncation followed by a Hilbert expansion to compute higher order flux terms.

Computation of all the terms in the Hilbert expansion would be a challenging task to say the
least. A formula for fo is easily obtained by solving the equation Q(fo, fo) = 0. This yields

ca) Ig = ue, HP
fo) = rag, ype OP (- 20x, ) (3.4)

for some density p > 0, absolute temperature @ > 0 and velocity u in R°.

Substitution of fo into the five balance laws given by the first five moments of the Boltzmann
equation yields the classical Euler equations displayed in the previous section where viscous
and thermal diffusion coefficient are set to zero. In fact, both Maxwell and Hilbert were able
to compute f;, and then substitution of the truncated expansion fo + €f; into the five balance
laws yields the Navier-Stokes—Fourier system. But as noted earlier, Maxwell realized that the
Navier-Stokes—Fourier system was unable to predict the motion of the Crookes radiometer.
Hence, Maxwell did the obvious next step and attempted to compute the next higher order
correction f7. When the Hilbert expansion is written in terms of the macroscopic quantities
of density, temperature, velocity and the spatial derivatives thereof it becomes the Chapman—
Enskog expansion. The term f: was computed in complete generality by Burnett [33-35] and
hence when the truncated sum fo + €f; + €?f2 is substituted into the five balance equations the


resulting system is called the Burnett equations. Some of the relevant terms that Maxwell was able
to evaluate are indeed identical to the terms Burnett computed some 50 years after Maxwell. As
