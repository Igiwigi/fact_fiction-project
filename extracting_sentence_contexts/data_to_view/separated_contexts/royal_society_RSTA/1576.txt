They have to be fitted together at the
interface. The Motion in the Wind.â€”Because the wind is independent of height we can reduce
it to a calm by giving a suitable translational velocity to our axes of reference. The
trajectory in this fictitious calm is then far from vertical, so that it is necessary to obtain
the required integrals of the dynamical equations, without neglecting any terms. This
is impossible without quadratures. There are, however, some analytic partway stages.
