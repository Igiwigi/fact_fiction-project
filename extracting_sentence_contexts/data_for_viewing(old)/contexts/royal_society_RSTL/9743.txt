the direction of its axis and not perpendicular to that direction as in the former case,
i and, similarly, the irregular bright central band will have its general direction along a
> normal section of the tube. So marked is the extension in the breadth of the image
Hue to these stripes of phosphorescence (Plate 27, fig. 15) that if the strip of tinfoil
- be a short one its phosphorescent image seems to be long and narrow and to have the
© Hirection of its length at right angles to the direction of the tinfoil. The same is the
© when a piece of tinfoil is placed longitudinally upon the tube; the greatest
fn tion of the image seems to be at right angles to that of the tinfoil. It will be
- understood that there is no actual rotation of the image through a right angle ; the
affect is solely due to the fact that the spreading out is at right angles to the direction
the length of the tinfoil, and that it is 80 great as to cause the breadth of the phos-
l poooont patch which it forms to be greater than the length of the strip of tinfoil.
2 That the above conclusions as to the law that governs the spreading out of the
[Smolecylar streams are correct was shown by placing strips of tinfoil in oblique
-Spositions, when ib was invariably found that the stripes or striations ran perpen-
> mu to the direction of the tangent to the strip of tinfoil at the point from which
ey proceeded. In order to test it rigorously, it was determined to place a strip in
h a curve that the normal planes to the curve would pass through the tangent at
SG corresponding point of the image of the curve, t.e., the curve on the opposite side
the tube, each point of which is exactly opposite to its corresponding point on
-2the tinfoil. In such a case all the striations must lie along the curve formed by the
Sloeus of the central patches of phosphorescence, and the result should be a single
