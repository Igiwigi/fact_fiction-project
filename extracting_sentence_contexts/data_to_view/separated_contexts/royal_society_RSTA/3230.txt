The maximum pressure (P) developed by a given charge is usually well known, and
by aid of the above formula the curve of rise of pressure can therefore be obtained
The radius of the cordite for successive intervals of pressure (p = 0°1P, p = 0:2 P,
&c.) is first computed, and the time required to burn through the corresponding
distance at the average pressure (p = 0°5 P, p = 0°15 P, &c.) is then determined. In
calculating the radius, the volume of the unburnt explosive must, of course, be taken
into account, and this renders the work somewhat tedious. The formula does not take into account the fact that under experimental conditions
some time elapses while the flame is spreading before the normal rate of combustion is
set up. The zero of the calculated curve is, therefore, shifted somewhat to the right,
and a sharper slope given to the initial stage (a, fig. 10). It may with some truth be argued that the error occurring at a very low pressure
would not affect the results as applied to ballistics, the calculation and experimental
curves being in agreement by the time the motion of the shot commences.
