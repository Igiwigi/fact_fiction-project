PRELIMINARY ELIMINATION OF SINGULARITIES

23. As in Part III (§5) we contemplate that singularities in the specified loading or
boundary tractions can be eliminated initially by recourse to the principle of super-
position. In two dimensions, analytical solutions exist for the effects of a concentrated
force acting either at or inside the boundary (cf. Love 1927, §§ 147-52) : using these we

can transform our problem into one which does not involve singularities, therefore is
more suited to the relaxation approach. The device was not in fact employed in any of
the problems of Part IIT, but in Part V (e.g. § 5) it was used to dispose of a logarithmic
infinity which was encountered in a problem of conformal transformation. Here its
application will entail more labour, since the analytical solutions are more complex ;
but its principles are unchanged whether the singularity is on or inside the boundary,
so do not call for further description here.

Il. PRACTICAL DETAILS OF THE RELAXATION TECHNIQUE

24. We now describe in detail, and in relation to particular examples, the relaxation
procedure by which approximate solutions can be obtained. Four separate problems
will be considered—viz. one example of each of the cases listed in §8. First we shall
exemplify case A of the extensional problem.
