Then

(i) T(t) can be extended to an analytic contraction semigroup on the sector 6,
(ii) If T(t) can be extended to an analytic semigroup on the sector Xy for some 6’ € (0, 5] then
< 4p, i.e. the angle 6, is optimal. In the self-adjoint case, we obtain « =0, hence cot 62 =0 and cot 6p = (|p — 2))/(2\/p — 1). It is
worth noticing that the angle is independent of the dimension and in fact the same result holds
in the infinite dimensional case as well. The asymptotic behaviour of T(t) in ub follows from the previous considerations and the
spectral results of §4b. It is clear, in fact, that T(t)f > Pf pointwise for f € C,(RN), where Pf
is the projection defined by the right-hand side of (3.12).
