A.A. developed and implemented tools for
[17], making it more likely to destroy and thus interfere sequence data analysis. M.A. coordinated the collection of clinical

with its target. In fact, we see that the helicase dead Cas2-3
is less able to overcome PLE even when directly targeting

specimens. A.C.M., M.A. and K.D.S. conceived of the study. All
authors participated in data analysis.
