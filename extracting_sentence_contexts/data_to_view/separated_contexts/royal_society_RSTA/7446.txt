Assuming the sediments to be non-
magnetic, the anomalous gradients at the surface of the earth will be linear over distances
small compared with the depth of the basement. In places where this simple scheme is
applicable, the effect of anomalies on the radial variation of the main field can be examined
and, if necessary, eliminated. The method depends on the fact that, in the absence of current flow and of magnetic
matter at a point, certain relations exist between the horizontal and vertical gradients of
the field components, because the following equations are satisfied :

culF=0, divF=0. It is necessary to use spherical co-ordinates and not Cartesian co-ordinates in this discussion,
since the accuracy to which the Z and H components are measured in the experiments is of
the order of the angle subtended at the geocentre by a distance on the surface of 1 km. At
a point (7,,A) the expressions for curl F and div F are as follows:

where i, j and k are the unit vectors in the directions (—z), (—x) and y, where the negative

direction of x and z is taken so that a right-handed system of co-ordinates is obtained.
