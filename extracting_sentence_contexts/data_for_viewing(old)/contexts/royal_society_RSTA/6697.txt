where A and are real, As

As these limits are arbitrarily near to 2/,/(28) if A and y are arbitrarily small, the inequality
(104) certainly cannot be isolated unless we exclude the possibility that (X?-+ ¥2) Z is
equivalent to (106).

We shall, however, prove that the inequality (104) is in fact isolated, if the above possi-
bility is excluded, and that this isolation still applies if an infinity of solutions are required.
For this we need three lemmas. We denote by K the body in three-dimensional space
defined by | (x2-+y2)z]<1.

Lemma 9. For any 5>0 there exists a number 0'>0 with the following property. Any lattice A
which is admissible for K and has a point at (1, 0,1), and for which

(A) <$,V (23) +0", (107)
is given by xtty =u+(0+p,) 0+ (+p) wv, | (108
