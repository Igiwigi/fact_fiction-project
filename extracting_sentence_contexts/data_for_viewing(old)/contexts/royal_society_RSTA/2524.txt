an immediate kind.) A similar remark can be made regarding Hilbert’s 24th problem, which was
written down, but never made public in its own time, but rather discovered in Hilbert’s Nachlaf
acentury later by Thiele [1].

It is nowadays referred to as Hilbert’s 24th problem due to the fact that it could have made
it into the famous collection of problems, 10 of which were presented on 8 August at the 1900
International Congress of Mathematicians, a total of 23 of which were published in [2] and made
widely known after the Congress through various translations.

The influence of the 24th problem was, as we will show in the sequel, considerable during
the century of its being sealed off from the world. The 24th problem asks, broadly speaking,
for ‘Kriterien fiir die Einfachheit bez. Beweis der gréssten Einfachheit von gewissen Beweisen
fiihren. Uberhaupt eine Theorie der Beweismethoden in der Mathematik entwickeln. Es kann
doch bei gegebenen Voraussetzungen nur einen einfachsten Beweis geben’. (Criteria of simplicity,
or proof of the greatest simplicity of certain proofs. Develop a theory of the method of proof in
mathematics in general. Under a given set of conditions there can be but one simplest proof.)
