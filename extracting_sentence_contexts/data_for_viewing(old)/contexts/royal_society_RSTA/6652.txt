The components (é,.5 tyys tezs ty2s tes ty) Of the stress at any point, which has co-ordinates
(x,y, Z) in the undeformed state, referred to a rectangular, Cartesian system of co-ordinates,
must then be related to the components (¢,,, 6), 622) €y2s €2x €) Of this pure, homogeneous
portion of the total strain at that point. Ifw, v and w are the components, parallel to the axes
x, y and z, of the displacement undergone by the point considered, in the deformation, then
(E43 € yyy +++) are given by equations (I, 3-9) of the foregoing paper.

In the foregoing paper, the concept of an incompressible, neo-Hookean material has been
formulated. Such a material is considered to be isotropic in its undeformed state and to
obey the stress-strain relations (I,3-10). It is readily seen that if the strain components
(Cs €jys ++») are specified, the hydrostatic pressure p is indeterminate. This results from the
fact that the material is incompressible. On the other hand, it is shown (I, §5) that if the
stress components (¢,,,4,,,...) are specified, the hydrostatic pressure p can be determined
in terms of them by means ofa cubic equation, which may yield one or three real values for ,
depending on the magnitudes of the stress components and of the physical constant EF.

It is shown, however, (I,§6) that only one of these values of /—the least—leads to real
values of the strain components (¢;,,¢,,,---)- It is thus apparent that if a cube of incom-
pressible, neo-Hookean material is subjected to a pure, homogeneous deformation and the
stress components in the deformed state are specified, the state of strain of the deformed cube
is uniquely determined. This fact can be used to prove the further theorem that if, in an
element of an incompressible, neo-Hookean material, which has the form of a cube in its
undeformed state, the total forces, acting normally over each pair of parallel faces, are
specified, then the components of strain are uniquely determined provided that one or more
