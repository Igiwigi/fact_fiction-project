(b) Mesoderm.â€”It has already been pointed out (HAsrHAmM, 1927) that anterior to the
region concerned with mesoderm formation by overgrowth and invagination, a region
of proliferation is set up from which develops a mass of cells, the anterior mesenteron
rudiment. The first three pairs of mesoblastic somites behind this are those of the
mandibles, maxillee and labium respectively. The position of these appendages has
already been noted and little need be said about their associated mesoderm beyond
the fact that it develops in the same way as in other regions of the body behind (Kasr-
HAM, 1927) and that each somite lies against the base of its appropriate appendage
(fig. 50). The head mesoderm in front of the mandibles, however, develops from the
proliferated mass of cells hitherto designated anterior mesenteron rudiment. The area
of such proliferation marks the position of the future mouth and the cells arising on the
yolk side of the germ hand at this place are continuous with the mandibular mesoderm
behind them.
