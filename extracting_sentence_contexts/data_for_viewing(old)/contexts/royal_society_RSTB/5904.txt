Before using the reading of a submerged photometer as a measure of the light under
water, it is necessary to consider carefully the effects of reflection at the various surfaces.
We always work with water in the spaces between the opal, any colour filters that may
be used, and the window of the submarine photometer, when the latter is in air.
Accordingly, these surfaces may be disregarded, except for a secondary effect discussed

below. We have also generally tried to maintain a layer of water over the opal also,
when the submarine photometer was being standardized on deck, This may not be
possible, however, in rough weather. From the fact that wet patches on the opal are
almost indistinguishable visibly from adjacent dry areas, showing that the light
scattered back is almost identical, we would not expect the presence or absence of a
very shallow layer of water to have much effect on the reading. That this is true was
shown by some tests carried out on shore with steady daylight and sunlight, altitude
32-33°, which gave an increase of 0-7 per cent. (mean of 14 measurements) when four
millimetres of water were present. As this is negligible for our purpose, the presence
of the water is immaterial.

Two important factors must, however, be considered which we may designate the
“external reflection factor’ and the “ internal reflection factor,” respectively. We
have always allowed for the first, as explained below. We are deeply grateful to
Mr. T. Sarru, F.R.S., for calling our attention to the second, which had hitherto escaped
