Correlation length as a function of the driving force according to equation (5.12).

for different t occurs, however, at moderate and large values of driving forces, namely, at
ABy > 0.2. At small ABo, the influence of relaxation time t is negligible. Such dependence exists
due to the fact that the time t influences the relaxation of fast variable—gradient flow, du/dt—
the variable which plays an essential role far from the equilibrium [11]. A general tendency is
that a longer relaxation time t makes the velocity increase slower. Indeed, the dynamics by the
parabolic Allen—Cahn equation (see equation (1.1) with t = 0) is defined by the relaxation of the
order parameter u only.
