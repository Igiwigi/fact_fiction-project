INTRODUCTION.

Much attention has been given in the last few years to the effects of deficiency of
vitamins D and A on dental and parodontal structure ; extended clinical tests have
been carried out ; and the deduction has been drawn that a deficiency of these factors
is a not infrequent cause of such common dental ailments as caries and pyorrhcea
alveolaris. Vitamin C has received relatively little consideration in this connection ;
in fact doubt is expressed as to whether it has any practical significance for clinical
dental disease, and difference of opinion exists even on the fundamental issue as to
whether a deficiency of the vitamin is in any way injurious to the teeth. Thus, on
the one side, Mrs. Metiansy (1929) found that lack of vitamin C had no influence on
tooth structure in puppies, and concluded it was ‘ improbable that the actual structure
of human teeth is greatly affected by a deficient intake of vitamin C.” At the other
extreme Howe (1920, 1921, 1923) claimed that by feeding guinea-pigs on a scorbutic
diet he had been able to produce with regularity all of the better-known dental lesions
seen clinically in humans, including alveolar resorption, spongy gums, pockets and pus
formation, together with caries and irregularities in the teeth themselves. He drew
the deduction that vitamin C deficiency is an important factor in the xtiology of human
dental disease. It will be generally conceded that further work is necessary to clear
up the present unsatisfactory position.
