river-like character, is seen in the frequent case of land-slips, as for instance that of
Goldau. And scarcely less instructive are the numerous examples, cited in the first
section of this paper, of huge masses of almost cold and brittle lavas being pressed
on with a uniform and graduated motion, by the almost unimpeded hydrostatical
communication of pressure from the yet active fluid which circulates unseen in their
pores. With this analogy before me, I replied in 1844 in the following terms to the
question, © How far a glacier is to be regarded as a plastic mass?” © Were a glacier
composed of a solid crystalline cake of ice, fitted or moulded to the mountain bed
which it occupies like a lake tranquilly frozen, it would seem impossible to admit such
a flexibility or yielding of parts as should permit any comparison to a fluid or semi-
fluid body transmitting pressure horizontally, and whose parts might change their
mutual position 80 that one part should be pushed out whilst another remained behind.
But we know in point of fact, that a glacier is a body very differently constituted.
It is clearly proved by the experiments of Acass1z and others, that the glacier is not
a mass of ice, but of ice and water; the latter percolating freely through the crevices

of the former to all depths of the glacier; and as it is matter of ocular demonstration,
that these crevices, though very minute, communicate freely with one another to
