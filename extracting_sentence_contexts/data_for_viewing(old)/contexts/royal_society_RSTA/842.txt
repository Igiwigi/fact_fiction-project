curved and ‘quantum’ in the sense of a non-commutative coordinate algebra, as a consequence of
a deep self-duality principle for quantum gravity [1-3]. We call this aspect the quantum space-time
hypothesis. It is a prediction which, if confirmed, would be on a par with the discovery of gravity
and indeed dual to it. What it could entail mathematically is our next topic.

3. Axioms of quantum Riemannian geometry

I will recap a constructive approach to this from my own work in the last decade (much of it with
Edwin Beggs) rather than the better-known ‘Dirac operator’ approach of Connes [19] expressed
in the axioms of a spectral triple. The two approaches have recently begun to come together with
our programme of geometric realization of Connes’ spectral triple [20].

In fact all main approaches have in common (in our case as the starting point) the notion
of differential forms (2,d) over a possibly non-commutative algebra A as a differential graded
algebra. This means

Q=G,2", d:2™">a2", d=0,

where 2°=A and d obeys a graded-Leibniz rule with respect to the graded product A. We
assume that Q is generated by A, @2!, in which case one may focus on (21, d) first and construct
higher differential forms as a quotient of the tensor algebra of this over A. Here

d:A>@!, (ab) =(da)b +a(db),  (adb)c =a((db)c),

where 2! has an associative multiplication from the left and the right by A (one says that 21 is
