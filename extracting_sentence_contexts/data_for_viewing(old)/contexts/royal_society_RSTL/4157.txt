I could not gainsay them. It was only after much inquiry that they became intelli-
gible, not until I had comprehended the varying movements of the ribs at different
parts; then everything, step by step, became lucid.

The sole duty of the muscles is to move the ribs. It is not because two muscles,
between two distinct pairs of ribs, have the same direction of fibres and the same
name, that they perform the same functions; it is because the two sets of ribs
go through the same motions simultaneously. If one set of ribs, the superior,
approach each other, while the other, the inferior, go further apart, on each inspira- |
tion, ought we not, & priori, to infer that the two sets of muscles passing between the
two sets of ribs will have different functions? that if the muscle between two snperior |
ribs that approach each other be inspiratory, that between two inferior ribs that recede
from one another will be expiratory? In truth we ought to infer this, for the fact is
80. Infact it is not the system of muscles, but the system of ribs that we must regard.

47. Scalenus.

In the Pig, the Sheep and the Calf, in addition to the scalenus of the first rib, there
is another scalenus that acts on a few of the superior ribs to raise them on their outer
surface. The Ass possesses no scalenus save that of the first rib. This scalenus
scarcely raises the first rib at either end, but it raises the rib at the centre, and con-
verts the upward into an inward curye.
