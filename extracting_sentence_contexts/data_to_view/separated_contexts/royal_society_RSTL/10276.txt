S Tn this species also the apical part of certain of the leaves becomes abortive, the
.5 basal part remaining as a permanent scale, as described by PRANTL for O. regalis. Todea superba. 'Z Tt was in this plant that the three-sided apical cell in the leaf was first found : since
2 the O8mundacee differ from the other Leptosporangiate Ferns in various characters both
Z external and anatomical, it was thought that an examination of the development of
Z the leaf might bring interesting facts to light. The three-sided apical cell has the
Z same orientation as in the two species of Osmunda described above, but its position

= does not appear to be maintained 80 exactly as in these plants, nor are the walls of
Â£& 8egmentation 80 accurately parallel to the sides of the apical cell, Further, the s8nb-
5 divisions of the segments present more frequent irregularities (Plate 37, fig. 7). In
E the absence of distinct marginal sevies of cells in the early stages of the firsb formed
5 pinne, and in the phyllopodium itself, while 8uch marginal series are to be found
S in the later formed pinne, and in later stages of the earlier formed pinnze, Todea
8uperba corresponds to the above 8pecies of Osmunda.
