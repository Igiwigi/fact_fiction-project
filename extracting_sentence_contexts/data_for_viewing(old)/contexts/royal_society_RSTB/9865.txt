Figure 1. Helping and aggression in the cooperatively breeding cichlid Neolamprologus pulcher. Subordinate helpers show brood care by cleaning the eggs of
breeders (a), by performing nest maintenance such as digging out sand (6), and by defending the territory against predators, such as Lepidiolamprologus elongatus (c).
Presumably, these helping behaviours are mediated by aggression from the breeder. In (d), a breeder (right) shows aggression towards a subordinate, and
the subordinate responds with submissive behaviour (tail quiver). Panels (eâ€”g) summarize results from experimental manipulations reported in previous studies.
Bars show the mean of the standardized frequency of behaviour. Standardization was done by subtracting the mean from each data point and dividing by the
standard deviation. Error bars are given by the standard error of the standardized frequency of behaviours. (e) Unrelated helpers (purple) provide more help than
related ones (green; [22]). (f) After subordinates have been prevented from giving help (dark blue), they compensate by increasing their previous help and sub-
mission level (light blue), presumably in an attempt to appease the breeder [19,25]. (g) Aggression levels in the group are normally very low (cream), but they
increase considerably when subordinates are experimentally prevented from helping (red; [25]).
