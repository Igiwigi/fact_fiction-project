larve of insects are characterized by morphous elements which contrast unquestion-
ably with those of the blood of adult insects. These, then, are the grounds on which
it is contended that the embryonic fluids of the Insect constitute a true chylaqueous
system ; that it is less complex than the true-blood by which it is destined to be snc-
ceeded; that its morphous elements are provisional ; that its basis and bulk consist
of water, vitalized by passage through the parietes of the digestive system ; that,
morphologically, its floating cells bear some relation to the species, but none to those
of the true-blood by which they are to be followed; and that, finally, it is atrated
before the evolution and independently of the agency of the tracheal system. The
principal trunks of the trachez are distinctly visible in the body of the larva long
before the stigmata (by which a communication is established between these tubes and
the external medium) are formed. The air-tubes, however, while yet closed at both
extremities, become filled with a gaseous substance. How is this curious fact to be
explained? In the atmospheric larve they cannot derive their gaseous contents directly
from the external air, for fluids and solids intervene ; nor in the water-larvz can they
absorb the air of the surrounding medium, for they are situated too deeply in the
interior of the body, those few species excepted in which appropriate appendages
are provided for the exposure of the tracheal system. The inference is thus rendered
probable that the trachee of the laryze of Insects, whether their habitat be atmo-
spheric or aquatic, become first filled with gas From the fluid occupying the visceral
cavityâ€”not because they already perform the office of atrating that fluid, but because
their parietes are endowed with the peculiar faculty of absorbing gaseons elements
from fluids by which they may be surrounded. Distended with gas, in the larva
stage they subserve the mechanical office of suspending the aquatic species in their
temporary habitation. 'The conclusion finally presses upon the mind, then, that the
