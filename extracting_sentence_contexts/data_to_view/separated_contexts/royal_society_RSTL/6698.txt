A new fact, if capable of being demonstrated to others, will be received at once as
true, but negative asertions, although supported by the authority of the most expe-
rienced, ought in matters of obseryation to be received with the greatest caution. It is one thing to assert that a cell has no fibre proceeding from it, or that a cell has
but one fibre, and another to state that no fibre or but one fibre has been demonstrated. Although many general facts are opposed to the notion of the presence of apolar and
unipolar cells, the existence of such cells is generally admitted and taught. If apolar
and unipolar cells exist at all, they are certainly less numerous than the multipolar cells;
and it is clear that the arrangement and action of the three classes of cells, apolar,
unipolar, and multipolar, must be yery different. Indeed it almost follows, if the three
classes of cells do exist, that there must be as many distinct kinds of principles of action.
