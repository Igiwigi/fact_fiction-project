epithelial layer of the retina, whilst the colour in those animals which have a
Tapetum lucidum is said to be entirely due to the reflection from this modified
choroidal layer.

This explanation is not satisfactory, and I have heard grave doubts as to its
correctness expressed by some of our most eminent ophthalmologists ; moreover, an
examination of the accompanying illustrations will suffice to justify my hesitation to
accept the views generally held.

The deep chocolate colour of the Negro and of the Anthropoid Apes might still be
explained by the red of the choroidal vessels shining through the pigment layer of the
retina, whilst absence of the retinal pigment might be held to account for the visibility
of the choroidal vessels in the Albino. The fact, however, that in all the Monkeys
lower than the Anthropoid Apes we meet with visible choroidal vessels, except when
the animal is of exceptionally dark pigmentation, seems to call for some other
explanation. If the choroidal vessels can be seen because the retinal pigment is
deficient, their vision ought to be defective as in the Albino, and not perfect, as it
evidently is. Nor can I see that the appearance which we meet with in the Bats
and Insectivora, in the Suricate and the Cynictis among the Carnivora, and in the
Suidze and Camelidee among the Ungulata, or the appearance of the fundus in the
Rodents and Marsupials, none of which have a tapetum, can be explained in any way
on the assumption that the colour is due to the choroidal vessels shining through the
retinal pigment layer.

It likewise seems difficult to accept the axiom that all those varied colours which
