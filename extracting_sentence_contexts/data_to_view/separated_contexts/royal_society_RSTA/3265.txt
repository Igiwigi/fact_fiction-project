Consider first the case in which a circular
path is chosen such that p < p9(Q1) (figure 7a). In this case, only one Ci (the central one) is
enclosed and the adiabatic wave function changes sign along this loop, as seen in figure 7a for
the 1!’ and 214’ electronic states. In fact, a similar sign change is expected when only one of the
three equivalent degeneracies of C2, symmetry is encircled (figure 7b). Conversely, as figure 7c
