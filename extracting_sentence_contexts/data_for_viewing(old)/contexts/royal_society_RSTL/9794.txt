*Three hours after, no considerable recovery where painted ; unpainted areas as
active as before.”

One further point, brought out by further experiments, may here be most con-
veniently mentioned ; it is that a specially great influence, or shock, seems to be
exerted on the external plexus by injury of the hypothetical internal plexus along the
lines of the ambulacral pores. The following observations will serve to show this —

*Another specimen was divided into two hemispheres. Tn one hemisphere two
adjacent ambulacral rows were thoroughly scraped on internal surface of shell, and

* Tt is remarkable that painting a portion of the internal surface of the shell shonld have the effect of
injuring the spines and pedicellaris of the corresponding portion of the external s8urface ; for the fact
8ems to 8how that there must eyerywhere be intimate neryous connexions passing through the calcarious
8nbstance of the shell. So far, however, we have not been able to detect histological evidence of snch
connexions,

then well rubbed with sandpaper and brickdust.* The spines along these lines were
laid in a very marked way, while spontaneity and reflex irritability, not only along
them, but also in the inter-ambulaeral spaces between them, were completely destroyed.
The rest of the hemisphere was normally active.
