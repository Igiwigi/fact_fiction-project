axis of a Stigmaria, whose maximum diameter is 6. This has, of course, been the
centre of a larger root than that just described. It gives off numerous root-bundles
proceeding towards the periphery of the bark, each of which possesses from ten to
fourteen vessels. These two specimens are the s8mallest examples of Stigmaria that T
have yet met with. On the other hand, in two large Stigmarian exogenous cylinders

in my cabinet, each of which has a diameter of fully an inch and a half, I found each
of the numerous root-bundles consisting of an average of about forty vessels. These
facts show that as the diameter of the exogenously developed root increases with
age, this growth is accompanied by a corresponding increase both in the dimensions
of each rootleb and in the number and magnitude of the vessels constituting its vascular
| bundle.

Fig. 17 represents the inner cylinder, c, with the vascular bundle, a, of a rootlet of

of but three small eccentrically placed vessels. The space b, occupied in the living
