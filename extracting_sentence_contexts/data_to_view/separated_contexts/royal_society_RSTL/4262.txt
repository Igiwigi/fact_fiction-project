fact the formula Cy+2HO correctly represents the composition, and the 8ubstance
may be supposed to be formed by the union of cyanogen in its nascent state with
2 equivs. of water. When this white snbstance is treated with acids, it is converted
into oxalic acid and ammonia. This fact, together with the analysis, proves it to be
Oxamive*®*. Its occurrence in a process of oxidation is very surprising, and perhaps
may throw some doubts on the theoretical compoxsition ascribed to it, 2CO+NH,. There is little doubt that this substance is the same as that observed by VavaueunÞ
in a watery s0lution of cyanogen, which however was not analysed by him.
