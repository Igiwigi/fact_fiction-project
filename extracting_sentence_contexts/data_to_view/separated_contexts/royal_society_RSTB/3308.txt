* The figures in these columns are calculated from the average body weight and the average blood
volume of the group.

17 per cent., and although the average deviation in the first case is under 2 per cent.,
in the second it is more than 10 per cent. (see Table XTX). Our experiments upon guinea-pigs therefore prove, as clearly as do the rabbits,
that our formula B = W'/f, indicating that the blood volume is a surface function,
represents the experimental facts in an extremely satisfactory manner. . At the same
time, it is obvious that it would be quite erroneous to attempt to express the
blood volume for a given species as percentage of the body weight, as has hitherto
been usual. VOL, CCI.—B. x
