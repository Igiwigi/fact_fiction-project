Hemolytic Action.—This has been tested by adding a small drop of blood (5 cub.
centims.) to solutions of different strengths of venom in isotonic salt solutions, and
counting the number of red corpuscles remaining after varying periods, as well as
noting the laking of the fluid and amount of undissolved sediment of corpuscles. It
was found that the venom must be used in a solution of the strength of 1 in 1000 to
produce marked heemolysis, and that even with this strength 24 hours at least were
necessary at room temperature (14° C.) to produce complete solution of human blood
in the proportion of 1 part to 200 of the venom solution. Slight dissolution,
however, was observed at the end of 3 hours, and marked after 7 hours. These
effects are about the same as those produced by a 1-in-100,000 solution of Cobra
venom under similar conditions. It is evident, then, that the hemolytic action of
Hamadriad venom is very small as compared with that of Cobra venom, being in fact
about equal to that which I found in the case of the Sea-snake venoms (1), and it
can have no direct part in producing the fatal effects of Hamadriad poison.

Blood Pressure and Respiratory Curves.

Tn order to ascertain how death is produced by Hamadriad venom, tracings of the
blood pressure with a Gad manometer and of the respirations with a Sandstrém
recorder connected with a tube in the trachea, have been taken, the poison being
injected intravenously. The following table summarises the general results of three
