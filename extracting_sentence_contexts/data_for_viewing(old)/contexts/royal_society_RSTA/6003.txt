Is it possible to find a new infinitesimal symmetry with a non-zero z-component? The answer
depends on the topology of the spatial domain 2:

() If Q=T® then Qz=T?. Note that the values of Z for which the pair (cos Z,asin Z)

is incommensurate, cover densely the region Z € [0,2z). In these cases, the pathlines
are infinitely long and cover densely the 2-torus 2z parametrized by (x,y). Let us call
the sub-manifolds Qz ‘ergodic’ in such cases. On the other hand, embedded in the
region Z €[0,2z) are an infinite number of points for which the pair (cos Z,asinZ) is
commensurate, with closed pathlines on the 2-torus 2z. We call the sub-manifolds 27
regular in these cases. Let 27, be an arbitrary regular sub-manifold, where Zo € (0,27).
Then, the open region Be = Uze(z)~,Z)+<) @z contains, for arbitrary small enough e > 0,
ergodic sub-manifolds 27. This is due to the fact that irrational numbers are uniformly
distributed on the real line (equidistribution theorem).
We claim that it is impossible to find an infinitesimal symmetry continuous on B,, and
defined globally there, with a non-zero component along the z-direction. To see this,
suppose that such a symmetry exists, call it 9(x,y,z,t), and assume without loss of
generality that its z-component is equal to 1 at f=0,x =0,y =0,z = Zo: 1§(0,0, Zo, 0) =
1. Let 5 be such that 0<6 <e and such that 27,45 € Be be ergodic. Recall that 5 is
arbitrarily small. Thus, the symmetry vector field 5y9(x,y,z,f) connects the point P:=
(0,0,Z9) € 2z, with the point P:= (5n9(0, 0, Zo, 0), 504 (0, 0, Zo,0), Zo + 8) € 27,45. Using
equation (3.3), let us denote the pathline passing through P by (X(r), Y(r),Zo) € 2z, We
[0,1], with (X(0), Y)) = (X(1), Y(1)) = (0,0) since 2z, is regular. Now, let us denote the
pathline passing through P by (X(s), Y(s), Zo + 8) € 27,45, 8 €(—0o, 00), which is not
closed because 27,45 is ergodic. But by definition the symmetry 9 maps the closed
