and the repulsion of the negative pole, upon a particle of free acid, placed in
water between them, should not (with equal currents of electricity) be as strong
as if that particle were previously combined with alkali; but, on the contrary,
as they have not a powerful chemical affinity to overcome, there is every reason
to suppose they would be stronger, and would sooner bring the acid to rest at
the positive pole*, Yet such is not the case, as has been shown by the experi-
ments on free and combined acid (526. 528.).

543. Neither does M. Â»z La Rive's theory, as I understand it, require that
the particles should be in combination: it does not even admit, where there are
two sets of particles capable of combining with and passing by each other, that
they do combine, but supposes that they travel as separate compounds of mat-
ter and electricity. Yet in fact, the free snbstance cannot travel, the combined
one can.

544. It is very difficult to find cases amongst solutions or fluids which shall
illustrate this point, because of the difficulty of finding two fluids which shall
conduct, shall not mingle, and in which an element evolved from one $hall not
find a combinable element in the other. Solutions of acids or alkalies will not
answer, because they exist by virtue of an attraction ; and increasing the solu-
bility of a body in one direction, and diminishing it in the opposite, is just as
gooda reason for transfer, as modifying the affinity between the acid and alkali
themselves. Nevertheless the case of sulphate of magnesia is in point (494.
495.), and shows that one element or principle only has no power of trans-
ference or of passing towards either pole.
