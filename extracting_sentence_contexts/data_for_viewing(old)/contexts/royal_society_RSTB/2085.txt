and recently by Kout,t viz., the examination of the uninjured leaf still attached to
the plant. The difficulty of accurate observation is greater than in the case of surface
sections, but this objection is amply compensated for by the leaf being in an absolutely
normal condition. The method is excellent in many ways ; unfortunately, it can only
be applied to certain selected plants. Kont uses Trianea bogotensis ; I have employed
Caltha palustris, Ranunculus Ficaria, Potamogeton natans, Callitriche verna.

Other methods are indirect in character, e.g., that of N. J.C. Mitier, who used the
rate of flow of air through a leaf as an index of the degree to which the stomata are
open. This method requires elaborate apparatus and must, I imagine, be slow in
action and difficult to manage, but I have no personal experience of it.

Another group of methods depends on the fact that in adult leaves transpiration is
stomatal rather than cuticular, so that, other things being equal, the yield of watery
vapour will depend on the degree to which the stomata are open, and may be used
as an index of their condition. A familiar demonstration is to place a leaf between
two plates of glass, when the glass in contact with the stomatal surface becomes
dewed with moisture, while the other plate remains dry. In 1878 Mercert invented
a refinement of this method; he used paper impregnated with certain salts of
palladium and mercury, which assume a dark brown or black colour when moistened.
In a hypostomatalÂ§ leaf the paper in contact with the lower surface of leaf changes
colour, while that on the astomatal upper surface retains its original tint or, at most,
shows a change which is insignificant in comparison with the effect produced by the
stomatal side.
