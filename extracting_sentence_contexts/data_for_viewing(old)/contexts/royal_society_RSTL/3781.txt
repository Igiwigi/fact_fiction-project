posed of globules, while others maintain that no globules can be discerned in it.

My investigations have led me to adopt neither of these views. Should the obser-
vations that I have to communicate be found deserving of attention, it will be owing
to my having carefully examined the structure of fibre in the course of its formation,
beginning with the very earliest stage. At this period, I bad to deal with an object
of considerable 8ize; the form of which, therefore, could be distinctly seen : and by
tracing the metamorphoses of the large and parent fibre, I was enabled to see in the
minute succeeding ones a structure, which I think would not otherwise have been
discerned. We may hereafter see the cause of the difference in opinion regarding
the structure of fibre.

The present memoir, though devoted to the investigation of fibre, is in fact a con-
tinuation of those which I have already communicated to the Society on the Corpus-
cles of the Blood F.

Formation of a Flat Filament within the Blood-corpuscle.—Structure of this Fila-
ment.—Presence of a Filament having the same appearance in the Coagulum of
Blood ; as well as in the Tissues generally, of both Animals and Plants — This Flat
Filament is what is usually termed a © Fibre.”

1. In the mature blood-corpuscle (red blood-disc), there is often to be seen a flat
filament or band already formed within the corpuscle. In Mammalia, including
Man (Plate V. figs. 4, 1, 2), this filament is frequently annular ; sometimes the ring
is divided at a certain part ; and sometimes one extremity overlaps the other. In
