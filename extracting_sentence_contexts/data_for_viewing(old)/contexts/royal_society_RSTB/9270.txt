ment may potentially be very large (figure 3c). We may thus
expect that selection should be weak on behaviours with poten-
tially opposing effects on disease transmission (particularly if
accurate assessment of the optimal strategy is low), but
should strongly favour both a pathogen-induced increase in
self-grooming and a reduction of allogrooming performed by
infectious individuals to their healthy, susceptible nest-mates,
as these are consistently beneficial for containing disease
(ie. independent of an exact assessment). Here, we may only
expect deviations from theory if expression of such behaviours
may be restricted or have little effect, as seems to be the case of
self-grooming in termites [21,51,52]. Yet, testing these predic-
tions is complicated by the fact that pathogen transmission
not always reflects disease transmission. Some low levels of
pathogen spread in societies can be beneficial, given that they
can induce immune-stimulating low-level infections of pre-
viously healthy group members, via social immunization [32].
