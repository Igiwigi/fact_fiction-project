Since this last term is bounded, the series of 0;T defined in (3.15) converges indeed in : 2

We infer that a similar argument implies also that the series generated by 0/"T, with m €N, :5
converge always in L®(0, tmax; Gil) This in particular implies that the function T belongs also : =
to C©(T x [0, tmax)), hence it is smooth. :8
In conclusion, we note that the constructed function T = T(x, t) in the function spaces specified [3
in (3.3) is indeed a weak solution of the main system (3.2), as it satisfies the equation in each :3

To conclude this section, we shall now devote our attention to the proof of the estimates in (3.9)
and (3.13). Throughout the forthcoming estimates, we will repeatedly consider high frequencies
satisfying |k| > 2(1 + |a|)9/. We begin with the following lemma for (3.9).

Lemma 3.4. For every ke Z satisfying |k| >2(1+ \a|)°/2, the three distinct roots given by =
dike 22k, 23,k€C of the polynomial p(r):= 25 — ad? — I? satisfy the following properties (in case,
commuting the order of the roots):

(i) The first root 41, is a real positive number, which increases as |k\*/, as the frequencies diverge.
