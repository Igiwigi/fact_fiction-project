To ensure accuracy several sets of double cells, C, C,, were prepared, as shown in the
figure (fig. 4). The top cell, C,, contained turbid water, the turbidity being caused by
suspended mastic. The mastic was very cautiously precipitated and was thus held in
suspension, As a matter of fact turbid water of different turbidities was prepared
nearly two years before it was employed; and thus any coarse particles had ample
time to settle ; for the vessels containing it were kept undisturbed during that period
and the liquid was syphoned off as required. The bottom cell, C,, contained pure
water. Behind the cell the exposing box (fig. 1), already described, was placed, and
in front of C, sectors which rotated by means of clock work.
