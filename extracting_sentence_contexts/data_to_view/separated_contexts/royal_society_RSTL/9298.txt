CAYLEY ON THE SINGLE

(where the arguments, written above, are used to denote the #0 arguments, viz. :
u+wv to denote (u+u", v+v') and u—wv to denote (u—u', v—v'); and where the
letters A, B denote each or either of them a single or double letter) in terms of the
functions of (4, v) and of (1, v') : and in any 8nch expression taking uv, v' each of them
indefinitely s8mall, but with their ratio arbitrary, we obtain the value of

A.dB—B.oA,

dividing by A?, the form is d3=a function of the quotient-functions E, &e., that is, we

have the differentials of the quotient-functions in terms of the quotient-functions
themselves. Substituting for the quotient-functions their values in terms of a, y, we
should obtain the differential relations between dx, dy, du, dv, viz., putting for
shortness X=a—#x.b—z.c—z.d—v.e—xzf—xr, and Y=a—yb—y.c=y.d—y.e—yſ—y,

these are of the form

each of them equal to a linear function of du and dv: 80 that the quotient-functions are

is thus an addition-theorem for them, in accordance with the theory of these integrals.

26. The first 16 equations of the product-theorem, putting therein first u=0, v=0,
and then v'=0, v'=0, and using the results to eliminate the functions on the right
hand side, give expressions for

in fact the 15 hyper-elliptic functions belonging to the integrals and there

(1, v) : and we have thus an addition-with-subtraction theorem for the double theta-
functions. And we have thence also consequences analogous to those which present
themselves in the theory of the single functions.
