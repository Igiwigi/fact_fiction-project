Coalescent fluid and fracture fronts. Most HF treatments take place in environments in which
the confining stress oo is large compared with a characteristic driving stress in the problem in
which case the lag between the fluid and fracture fronts becomes negligible. Rather than trying to
capture this vanishingly small lag with an extremely fine mesh it is preferable and more efficient
to derive the appropriate boundary conditions that hold in this limiting situation. We consider
the limit C,(t) - C(t) in which the two fronts coalesce in the simplest case of an impermeable
medium C’ = 0 (for further details, see [36]). Assume that the confinement op is large compared
with a reference stress so that o9/(/VE7?/K’) > 1 then the fluid lag 4 decays exponentially as
this ratio increases [34] and vanishes as 09 > oo (here V = |V¢| <|V)). In this limit w(x, f) > 0 for


x € Cr, the Stefan condition V¢ = q/w, combined with |V¢| <|V|, and the fact that the crack front
velocity is finite, implies that q=0 and Vs — V. Thus, the zero pressure boundary condition at
the fluid front (2.13) is replaced by a zero flux boundary condition at the crack front and from
(2.3), it follows that the net pressure p = —o9 + —oo. Thus the boundary conditions that apply for
coalescent fluid and fracture fronts are

K(x, t)=Kje for |V| >0

w(x, t) =0,
Kj(x,t) < Kj, for |V| =0

, and q(x,f)=0 for x €C(t). (2.15)
