gurface of which corresponds to the eleyation of the papille. 'These spaces contain
Aierococei imbedded in a transparent fluid. In those pocks in which the formation of
pustules is going on, the corium becomes gradually penetrated by the elements which
have been preyiously in the epidermis, viz. icrococct and nuclei; thus the boundary
between epidermis and corium gradually loses its sharpness. The papillze show sometimes

in their longitudinal axis an infiltration of fine granules.

a Tn the deeper parts of the corium larger or smaller tracts present themselyes, formed
E partly by larger spherical cells and partly (sldom though) by a finely granular s8ub-
S 8tance. LuGINBUAL therefore makes the whole process start in the epidermis, and hence
S gradually to extend into the corium. These statements are, according to my obser-
©  yations of yariola of sheep, wholly inconsistent with the facts occurring in this latter
i= disease, which, as is well known, is in clinical and anatomical respects very similar if
& not analogous to smallpox of Man.

E way :—lIn papules, on the second day of their appearance, the epidermis is eleyated,
© apparently from the increased thickness of the rete Malpighii, the individual cells of

VS enlarged. The vessels in the corium, those in the papillary region as well as those
"= beneath it, are distended ; on their walls are numerous small ronndish cells, and similar
FI cells are found in the stroma of the papille. The papillze and glands are unchanged.
