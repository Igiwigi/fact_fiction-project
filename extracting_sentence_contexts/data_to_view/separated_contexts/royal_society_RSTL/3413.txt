'These are questions which it will be at once
8een all preceding researches leave quite untouched, and they must evidently be, at
least in great part, 'solved before any considerable portion of light can be thrown
upon this difficult part of science. I do not pretend to haye established in the present paper a complete solution of
those difficult questions. In fact, months of continued investigation have proved to
me, that the subject is still more complex than the statement above given would
point it out to be. If my results appear to have placed the problem of the origin and
