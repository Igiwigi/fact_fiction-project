Zinc Tod. the very numerous
threads which freely perforate the entire thickness of the cell-wall gradually come into
view, and resemble in both arrangement and properties those of Strychnos. The fact
that the threads cross the middle lamella is even better demonstrated in Tamus than
in the former instance, for here the development of the lamella is not 80 great. The
cell-walls s00n swell very strongly, and in 80 doing the threads are broken up into'a
number of points, as TAx6L has observed, and in the swollen portion of the wall ab
last become invisible (Plate 70, fig. 33). In Dioscorea the threads are much finer than
in either Strychnos or Tamus.
