But as we must be content to use the sphere B
at pressures lower than this but still too high for sphere A, it is necessary to regard
the ratio as descending as low as one to eighteen. Forestalling speculations on the possibility of dealing with this one-thirteenth, say,
to one per cent. of its value—or to yylypth of the whole condensation, I give the
results of an entire series of six experiments in which this ratio holds, in fact the
series from which—taken at random—I have borrowed the foregoing figures. The
mass of air, 4:2854 grms., affords over the mean range of 84°52 a precipitation of
0°11629 grm. There is a want of balance between the thermal capacities of the
vessels, making the observed precipitation 0°15217 grm.
