In 2016, this came to fruition with the first IPTA data release, which
included data on 49 millisecond pulsars with data spans ranging from 5 to 21 years [32]. Combining the data from the eight PTA telescopes around the world not only improved the
cadence of the observations, which were as frequent as every 3 days, but also gave a broader
range of observing frequencies. In fact, some pulsars in the combined datasets are regularly
observed at five frequencies. Significant progress was made on understanding and prescribing
how these disparate datasets can best be combined [32]. A second data release is planned for
2018, which will combine the data from the most recent updates from the individual PTAs.
