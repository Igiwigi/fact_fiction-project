In the prior work [36], we made a notable observation from the FEM results that the quadratic
coefficient for attenuation is twice that for velocity variation, as has already been accounted
for in equations (5.1) and (5.2). Furthermore, the quadratic coefficient is independent of the
spatial TPC and therefore is independent of a specific material microstructure; the resulting FAM
has demonstrated excellent applicability to different microstructures with contrasting grain size
distributions and grain shapes [36,37]. Most importantly, the applicability extends exceptionally
well to the quasi-static velocity limit. This is further supported by the fact that the quadratic
coefficient q of 73/2 obtained in our prior work [36] is essentially the same as that from the
quasi-static SC fit in table 3 for cubic materials with Ad > 1.

In this work, we determine the quadratic coefficient of the FAM differently by obtaining it
from the SC model fit of the quasi-static velocity results. We have extended the FAM to other
symmetries, for which the quadratic coefficient q in equations (5.1) and (5.2) is taken from the
quasi-static SC fits in table 3. In this extension, we also assume that the quadratic coefficient for
attenuation is twice that for phase velocity variation for all symmetries (which exhibits some
inaccuracy, as we will show later). The resulting FAM predictions are provided in figure 3 for
materials with different symmetries. The figure shows that:
