At the east and west
sides the bowl has two deep notches in its margin. Through these, two small
streams enter on the westâ€”one pure and cool, the other sulphurous ; and on the east
the effluent stream emerges. It is, in fact, an enlargement of part of the channel
produced by the action of a powerful soufritre, which has decomposed the rocks
around its orifice, and produced a funnel-shaped cavity through which the stream
flows, and out of which it washes all the finer mud due to the churning of the water
by the uprising steam. The north and south walls are perhaps 50 feet high, and
show the effects of the acids generated by the oxidation of the hydrogen sulphide in
their crumbling decayed surfaces,

The pool was full of milky, greenish water, boiling furiously towards its centre,
where it was seething like a gigantic caldron. The smell was oppressive, especially
when the wind blew towards us and carried with it the steam and gases.
