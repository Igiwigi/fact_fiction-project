intrinsically degenerate. In transit spectroscopy, the degeneracy in the retrieval of molecular
abundances may be caused by the imprecise knowledge of Rp (equation (2.1)). In IR
eclipse and direct imaging spectroscopy, the information on molecular abundances is
entangled with the atmospheric vertical thermal profile; see for instance Tinetti ef al.
[90] for a more detailed discussion. For transiting planets, to remove the degeneracy
between molecular abundances/planetary radius or molecular abundances/vertical
thermal gradient, a broad wavelength coverage is needed together with adequate
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and spectral resolving power (SRP) (see point 7). Direct
imaging observations also suffer from the lack of knowledge of the planetary radius and
sometimes mass. When the mass and the radius are not known, model estimates need to
be invoked, increasing the source of degeneracy.

. Accurate linelists are an essential element of radiative transfer models, and this fact is not
always appreciated. As a result, the abundances for molecular species are often derived
with linelists that are incomplete or extrapolated from measurements/calculations at
low temperatures. This issue—especially together with point 3—may introduce large
errors. For instance, all the current claims of carbon-rich or carbon-poor planets [91]
published in the literature are unsubstantiated for this reason. This problem is well
known to spectroscopists, and linelists at high temperatures are being calculated ab initio
or measured in the laboratory [92].

. We are dealing with very low SNR observations. While the adoption of new data analysis
methods and models might address some of the issues listed above, the lack of good data
is something we cannot solve in the short term. I indicate below the SNR per spectral
resolution element and SRP that would be needed to guarantee a sound spectral retrieval.
