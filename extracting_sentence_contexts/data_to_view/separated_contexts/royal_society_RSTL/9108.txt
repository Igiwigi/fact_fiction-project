The Jast subject of which I shall treat in the present communication is the effects
of various muscle- and nerve-poisons on the locomotor system of Meduse. In my former
paper I dealt briefly with this subject; but, having this year bestowed a considerable
amount of additional labour upon it, I shall now disenss it at 8omeyhat greater length. The subject appears to me one of considerable importance, seeing that the effects of the
muscle- and nerve-poisons have never, as yet, been systematically tried on'the Medusw—
animals that present us with the earliest appearance both of muscle and of nerve, I make
this remark in order to excuse myself for burdening this already over-lengthy paper with
a number of additional facts, which will be of interest only to the physiologist. $ 1. Chloroform.—My observations with regard to the distribution of neryes in Sarsia
led me to investigate the order in which these connexions are destroyed, or temporarily
impaired, by anzesthetics.
