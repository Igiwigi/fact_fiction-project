work could be carried out profitably it was necessary to define the degree of
anoxeemia which existed, not only by observations on the degree of cyanosis which
may be seen, but by obtaining a definite answer to two questions :—

(1) What is the partial pressure of oxygen in the arterial blood ?
(2) What is the percentage saturation of oxygen in the arterial blood ?

The colour both of the countenance and of the arterial blood bears instructive
testimony to the degree of saturation of the blood with oxygen.

(a) Cyanosis.—The colour of the blood when it entered the syringe from an
artery was very striking. The arterial blood invariably looked more or less dark, a
fact which explained the peculiar complexions of all who had any colour in their
cheeks.

Many of the natives of Cerro are sallow, but the majority, and especially
the children, have ruddy complexions. The red in their cheeks is, however, of
a different hue to that of a full-blooded person at the sea-level. It contains an
intermixture of blue, so that it would be almost more accurate to call their cheeks
plum-coloured than rosy.
