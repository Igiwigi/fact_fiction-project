In [10], the authors introduce a monotonicity function which is considered only in Bf
and uses strongly the almost-convexity properties of the set {u = 0}. The result in [10] states that

where u is the solution to the thin obstacle problem. This monotonicity result uses the fact that
the smallest eigenvalue, given by

where Vg denotes the surface gradient on the unit sphere, and (0B))~ = {x’ =(x",xn-1) € RR” 1:
Xn—1 <0} is given by Ap = (2n — 3)/4. Using this monotonicity formula, one can prove the growth rate of order 3/2 from free
boundary points. To prove this, it suffices to show that supp |Ux,| < cr,

°It is noteworthy that the solution may exhibit higher order regularity at free boundary points, depending on the number of
connected components of {1 <0} in the upper half-ball.
