After further heating
the leak becomes more steady, and then always rises with the temperature. These
facts seem to show that an old wire does not absorb hydrogen above a certain
temperature, or only does so very slowly. The fact that while the leak is rising with time it falls on raising the temperature
is difficult to explain. This effect was obtained on several separate occasions. The
leak, then, has a definite maximum value at a certain temperature.
