Swimming
cells are still assumed to be slightly heavier than the ambient fluid, but gyrotaxis and gravitaxis
are neglected and the upswimming is exclusively due to phototaxis. The swimming velocity,
however, depends on the intensity of light I, with positive phototaxis for light intensity below
a critical value I, (I < Ic), and negative phototaxis otherwise (I > I-). This captures the fact that


phototactic organisms move away from intense light to avoid photodamage [27], and results in a
tendency to accumulate cells where I ~ I,. The swimming velocity in equation (2.3) is then

20, I<k,
V=VsT(Dk, where T(I) (3.1)
<0, I>k. Here k is the vertical unit vector and T(I) is the phenomenological taxis function with values
between â€”1 and +1 (figure 3a).
