into METLIN and searched by ‘multiple fragments’. The MS/MS spectra for the METLIN AC
standards, including palmitoyl-AC (C16 : 0) (figure 3b), share these ion distributions. The structure
was putatively designated as an AC with a 7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z-docosatetraenoyl acyl chain, since
this chain is commonly observed in lipids and fatty acids in nature. ACs and hydroxy-ACs share
the same ions except for m/z 144.132, which is m/z 145.10 in OH-ACs [34]. Unlike other ACs,
C22:4 acylcarnitine was downregulated 3.5-fold in RCS rat eyes (three weeks) as compared with
controls, but was not dysregulated in older rats. The biological relevance of this shift is unknown.

(c) Differential regulation of DHA and related species

The omega-3 fatty acid DHA (4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z-DHA, C22H320z) is essential for retinal
homeostasis. In this study, DHA was downregulated in the RCS dystrophic rats by 2.4-fold
compared with wild-type (figure 4a) at 52 weeks. In fact, our results showed progressive loss
of DHA in RCS eyes at all time points from 1.5 weeks to 52 weeks (data not shown).
