KrF. —The F lines form parallel series in which the constant separations depend on
the satellite separations of the D series. In other words the limits are the d (1)
sequents which form the satellites. Now it has been shown above that the abnormal
triplet separations which the D series exhibit is probably due to the fact that the d
sequent for a given satellite triplet is not the same for each of the three lines, but
that they are subject to a displacement of one or more ouns. For instance where », is
788 in place of 786 (in round numbers) the difference 2 is due to the fact that d,, is
not equal to d,, but is d,,(6,). If the strongest line is to be.
