This was the con-
clusion reached by Bricks, and there can be no doubt that it is correct. But we
have shown that the darkening of illuminated skin is a reflex phenomenon, which means
that the stimulation of the dermal photoreceptors by light causes a relaxation of the
pigmentary effectors. This fact only becomes intelligible on the assumption that the
response to stimulation of the dermal photoreceptors which, for brevity, we will call
the dermal response, is due to reflex inhibition. And since in the dark, i.¢., in the
absence of photic stimulation, the melanophores are maximally contracted, one is
forced to conclude that they are maintained in this condition—in a state of tonic
contraction, as it were—by the agency of the pigmentomotor neurones. This inter-
pretation was also considered by Briickn, but with some degree of scepticism for the
reason that he knew of no parallel example of such inhibition among spinal reflexes.
