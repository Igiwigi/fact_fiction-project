I have found that the explosion-wave is sooner initiated when electrolytic gas is
largely diluted with oxygen than when it is diluted with the same volume of
nitrogen ; a fact which explains the apparent anomaly in BrrrHEnor’s experiments.

On repeating my measurements of the rate of explosion of electrolytic gas with
large volumes of diluent gases, some discrepancies were found, which could not at
first be explained. A tube of larger diameter (13 mm.) was then substituted for the
smaller tube (9 mm.). The results were more regular.. It was then discovered that
the explosion frequently died out near the end of the smaller tube, whilst transmit-
ting a sound-wave sufliciently powerful to break the silver foil composing the “second
bridge.” A record was thus obtained on the chronograph plate, indicating a smaller
velocity than the true rate of explosion. By inserting a glass tube just before the
second bridge, and watching for the flame, the observers made sure that the explosion-
wave reached the end of the pipe. A second precaution, which must also be observed
in experiments on largely diluted gases, is to make sure that the explosion-wave has
