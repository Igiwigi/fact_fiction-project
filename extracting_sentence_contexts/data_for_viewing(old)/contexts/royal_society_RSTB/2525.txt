That the Lycopodineous series has no near relationship to the Osmundacez seems
apparent on various grounds, which can be more conveniently discussed at a later
phase. The consideration of the anatomy of the whole group seems to establish that
instead of being more primitive than, and antecedent to, the fern-type with the
so-called polystelic central cylinder, they are merely a specialised condition of the
latter. The resemblance to the condition which Zener finds in the young axis of
the polystelic ferns is only an apparent one and arises from the degeneracy and
specialisation of the stelar system of the Osmundacez.

Ophioglossacee.—The development of the sporophyte in Botrychium virginianum
has already been described by the writer. The young stem is (Gametophyte of
B. virginianum,” ‘ Canadian Inst. Trans.,’ 1898) essentially like the adult. Porauur
has called attention to the fact that in the young stem of certain species of
Botrychium and Ophioglossum an internal endodermis is present, which is continuous
with the external one through the foliar gaps of the central cylinder.

Farmer has more recently described a similar phenomenon in the adult plant of
Helminthostachys zeylanica. The central cylinder of the Ophioglossaceze closely
resembles that of the Osmundacew. Evidences of its derivation from an originally
concentric stelar tube are, however, not so abundant. The presence of concentric
petiolar bundles in Botrychium virginianum and of mesarch wood in the stem of
Helminthostachys, however, point in this direction (FARMER, ‘ Ann. of Bot.,’ vol. 13,
p. 432).

Schizwacee.—There is considerable variety of stelar structure in this group. — Its
