tive system in sleep is that it is never 80 complete as, under all circumstances, 0
to prevent its excitement. On this alone it depends, we shall find, that it has
no fatal tendency. The degree of sensibility which remains in sleep is the
distinguishing mark between it and the torpor of disease. That sleep alone is
healthy from which we are easily roused. If our fatigue has been such as to |
render it more profound, it partakes of disease, that is, as will appear more
clearly from what I shall have occasion to say of the different species of apo-
plexy, the vital system partakes of the debility, or ome cause is operating
which prevents the restoration of the sensitive system.

Distinct as the vital and sensitive systems are, we know that neither can long
survive the other. In a paper which appeared in the Philosophical Transac-
tions for 1829, I stated or referred to the facts which prove that in all modes of
death, except the most sudden, arising from causes which s0 impress the ner-
vous system as instantly to destroy all the functions, those of the sensitive
system are the first which cease. The animal only dies when his means of
enjoyment and intercourse with the world which surrounds him, no longer
exist. This consequence is constant and never long delayed. It is necessary
therefore to a clear view of the state of the functions of the animal body in
sleep, to determine the bonds of union between the sensitive and vital systems;
at first view s0 distinct, which render their existence, except for a very limited
time, inseparable.

That the sensitive cannot exist independently of the vital system, is evident,
on the slightest consideration ; but the dependence of the latter on the former
