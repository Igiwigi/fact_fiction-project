An inspection of the numbers contained in the columns headed Q will show that the
cause here inyestigated is amply sufficient to account for the facts mentioned by Las.

It may be noticed that while g is 4 times smaller, and I, is 16 or 18 times larger, for
c=-49 than for e=*98, there is no great difference in the values of Q in the two cases
for hydrogen and mixtures of hydrogen and air in given proportions. This arises from
the circumstance that g is sufficiently small to make the last terms in p; and (3, namely,
1 and 819”?, the most important, 8 that I, does does not greatly differ from 819-?. If
this result had been exact instead of approximate, the intensity in different gases, 8up-
posed for simplicity to be at a common pressure, would have varied as D#; and it will be
found that for the cases in which p=1 the yalues of Q in the above Table, especially L
those in the last column, do not greatly deviate from this proportion. But the simplicity
of this result depends on two things. . First, the vibration must be expressed by a L
LaPLAce's function of the order 2; for a different order the power of D would have been
