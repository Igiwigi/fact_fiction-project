succession or vice versa. As regards composition this assemblage of fossil organisms
(for fauna see WALTON, 1928) bears a close resemblance to that of the Posido-
nomya Shales in the valley of the Mohra in Western Upper Silesia (Parretsky, 1929).


KNOWLEDGE OF LOWER CARBONIFEROUS PLANTS. 349

Besides the plant-bearing beds in the Upper Black Limestone at Teilia, another
important horizon with plants occurs near the base of the Limestone Series in North
Wales and Flintshire. This horizon is separated from the overlying Teilia beds by
about 700 metres of limestone. (See stratigraphical table p. 373.) The flora of
these lower plant-bearing beds will be described in a future memoir, but attention may
be called to the fact that Archaeosigillaria vanuxemi Girp. sp. has been recorded (H1nD
& Sropss, 1906) from them and at one locality it occurs in great abundance.
