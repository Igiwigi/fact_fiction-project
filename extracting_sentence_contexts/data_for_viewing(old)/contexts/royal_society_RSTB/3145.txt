attaches itself to the side of the cesophagus (figs. 18 and 25). This strand contains
no nucleus at first, but is simply a protoplasmic process of the ectodermic cell. The
nucleus of this ectodermic cell then undergoes division, one of the resulting nuclei
wandering out into the strand (figs. 27 and 33), while one remains in the mother cell
of the ectoderm. Shortly after this a second nucleus appears in the strand
(figs. 34-36), but whether this arises from the nucleus situated in the ectoderm,
I have been unable to determine. I have never observed the division that gives rise

to this second nucleus taking place. It is somewhat incorrect, therefore, to speak of
the nephridial rudiments as composed of three cells, when, as a matter of fact, they
represent uniform strands of protoplasm in which three nuclei have taken up their
positions. While the strands show the subsequent grouping of their cytoplasm
about these nuclei, as in figs. 32, 30, and 36, which simulate the appearance of three
distinct cells, no actual cell boundaries are to be discerned.

In fig. 24, which represents a transverse section at right angles to the axis of the
cesophagus taken obliquely through the margin of the young larva, the section shows
the head-kidneys as thin strands. In one of these two nuclei are seen, one close to
the oesophagus, and the other in the ectoderm. At a rather later date a third
appears. In the other strand the nucleus of the ectoderm alone is present. In
fig. 20 the origin, on one side, of one of these nuclei is shown taking place. This
section passes through the ventral plate of the larva somewhat obliquely, so only one
