Reynolds numbers Re = U(2H)/v >> 1 depends very crucially on the wall roughness. It is only
for rough walls that there is a strict ‘dissipative anomaly’, with f(Re,k/H) tending to a constant
value f,(k/H) as Re— oo, as indicated both by experiments [27-29] and simulations [30]. By
contrast, smooth-wall pipe flow may be idealized by taking k = 0 and it is observed that f(Re) > 0
as Re — oo [31-36]. Roughly, the laminar value f ~ 32/Re is observed for Re < 10%, followed by
the Blasius law f ~cRe~/* for 10° < Re $ 10°, and then the von Karman-Prandtl Law [37,38]
given implicitly by 1/,/f =alog(Re,/f) + b for Re = 10°, with suitable constants a, b, c. In fact,
the above summary only roughly states the most common interpretation of the observations
and there are many refinements and alternative proposals. In particular, there is an old idea of
Prandtl and others that the drag may be power-law f(Re) ~ Re~? with an exponent p(Re) that tends
slowly to 0 as Re — oo; for example, see [23], Ch XXa for the classical literature and [39,40] for a
modern reincarnation. Despite intense ongoing discussion of the details, the observations support
unequivocally the fact that f(Re) decays much slower than the laminar rate 1/Re as Re — oo.
Following the terminology introduced for kinetic energy dissipation [19,20], we may refer to this
sublaminar decay as a ‘weak dissipative anomaly’, in contrast to the strong dissipative anomaly
with a non-vanishing limit that is observed for rough walls. We discuss here further the case of a
finite (but large) range of Re in the Blasius range.

The dynamical consequences of these anomalies can be most easily understood by an
examination of the global momentum balance. We consider as the simplest situation a channel
flow in domain 2 which is periodic both in the streamwise direction x €[—L,L] and in the
spanwise direction z ¢[—W,W] and with the vertical coordinate y constrained to lie between
two surfaces y= H_(x,z) and y= H(x,z), where H.(x,z) are smooth functions that satisfy the
conditions |H(x,z) = H|<k to model hydraulically rough walls. The governing equation is
