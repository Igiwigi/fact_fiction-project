ingly, on introducing a very susceptible time-keeper, H, into
an atmosphere zo0* warmer than the ordinary state of the air,
for ten seconds, no visible alteration of rate resulted ; and it
may hence may be inferred, that the changes of temperature
which have taken place during the preceding experiments,
in consequence of variations in the density of the air, can
have had no share in producing those changes of rate which
have been perceived ; and that they resulted from alterations
of pressure alone.

A change of rate in a chronometer, from an alteration in
the density of the medium in which it is placed, considered
as a simple fact, seems demonstrated from the foregoing
experiments. Different hypotheses may probably be ad-
vanced respecting the cause; but, the supposition which
appears the most probable is, that a change takes place in,
the arc of vibration of the balance, in consequence of the
altered density of the air, and a consequent variation in the
rate of the timekeeper, from the imperfect isochronism of
the balance.
