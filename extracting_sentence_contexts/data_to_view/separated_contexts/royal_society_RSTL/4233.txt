Sone of the particulars which we may learn from the preceding table are the fol-
lowing. The first results contained in it are those relating to grass, whose radiating power
appears to be such, that the reading of a thermometer when placed on it when long,
is less than when it is placed on short by 1*1; the next result relating to grass is
that of the temperature on the snurface of the oil under it, which is such that the
reading of a thermometer under long, exceeds that under short by 1*1; being ex-
actly the same amount in excess under as it was in defect on the top; and bence
the cause of the difference of the readings on the top of long and short grass arises
s0lely from the greater quantity of heat conducted to the surface of the latter from

the 80il, over that conducted to the surface of the former, and not from the greater
quantity of heat radiated into space from the long, over that radiated from the short ;
$uch being the case, it was to be expected that the readings of a thermometer would
yary with every variation of the length of grass upon which it was placed, and snch
was found to be the case. In fact, the readings of thermometers placed on grass were found to differ with
every variation of length, fineness and closeness of its blades. My experiments
have been made on that differing only in the length of its blades, and the differences
arising from this cause were found to vary with every variation of the excess of the
temperature of the air over that of long grass. The following are the mean results
of experiments in this respect :—
