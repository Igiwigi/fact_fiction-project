with HIV/AIDS have produced a decline in food secur-
ity sufficiently great to have spurred new thinking on the
origins of famine (e.g. New Variant Famine Hypothesis:
de Waal & Whiteside 2003). Hlanze et al. (2005) state
that ‘increasingly it is becoming difficult to separate
the food security impact of drought from that of HIV/
AIDS. The two work in tandem to cause poor harvests
and reduced incomes.’ For households afflicted by HIV/
AIDS, wild foods offer nutritious dietary supplements
at low labour and financial costs. This is important
when considering the negative impact of a household’s
HIV/AIDS status on income and food security
(Kaschula 2008), together with the fact that deficiencies
of micronutrients (in which many wild foods are rich)
critical to immune-system function are ‘commonly
observed in people living with HIV in all settings’
(Piwoz & Bentley 2005). Food stress associated with
HIV/AIDS can drive households to intensify wild food
use, putting unsustainable pressure on local resources
especially when combined with deepening poverty or
indeed conflict (Dudley et al. 2002). In South Africa,
Kaschula (2008) found that wild food use was
significantly more likely in households afflicted by HIV.

However, use of wild foods could also decline due to
