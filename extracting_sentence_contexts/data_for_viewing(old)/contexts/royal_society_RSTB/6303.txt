and the remaining families are placed among the other two orders, the Stolido-
branchia and Aplousobranchia, the enlargement of which necessitates re-definition.

It has been stated already that since there is a correlation between the body size
of an individual and the presence or absence of branchial papillae, and also between
size and the fusion of papillae to form inner longitudinal vessels, that such differences

are of questionable value when used for the distinction of orders, as in distinction
between the Phlebobranchia (Dictyobranchia) and the Aplousobranchia (Kriko-
branehia). This objection is supported by the fact that distinction itself is not
exact, for in the Synoicid genera Polyclinum and Glossophorum, both with relatively
large branchial sacs, papillae are definitely present.

Apart from this relegation of branchial structure to a place of secondary impor-
tance, the classificatory scheme proposed agrees with the more general conception
of ascidian relationships.

In fig. 14 is summarized diagrammatically the interrelationships of the various
orders, families and genera.
