quantity ¢C can only vary due to changes in the number of molecules of X in the gas phase,
which—in a closed system—only occur because of the adsorption/desorption reaction with the
solid matrix. The mass balance on the molecules of X in the volume V; will therefore read

where ¢ is a specific surface area, i.e. the area of solid matrix divided by the total volume Vt.
Notice that when we expanded the derivative on the RHS of the previous equation, we had to
account for the fact that the specific surface area ¢ can change in time because of the swelling of the

matrix. In a similar way, we cannot consider the porosity ¢ as constant in time when calculating Ss
the time derivative of the LHS of equation (2.2), due to the fact that we assumed that V, varies : s
with o while V¢ remains constant. This will therefore produce a term proportional to d¢/dt for : =
which, together with the term d¢/dt, we should in principle provide additional evolution laws. : =
This task can be properly performed only if we know how the mechanical properties of the 13
