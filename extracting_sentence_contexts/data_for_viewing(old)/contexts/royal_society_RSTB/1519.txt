the right anterior extremity.

In all cases the muscles first connected with one myograph were afterwards
connected with the other, and further epileptic convulsions induced in order to
exclude the possibility of one myoyraph being more easily acted on than the other,
and thus accounting for the remarkable difference observed in the records from the
two fore-limbs. This precaution was superfluous, however, for as has already been

said, direct observation of the exposed extensor muscles, during the epileptic con-
vulsions, alone served to place beyond doubt the fact that the muscles of the right
extremity were in vigorous contraction, while those of the left extremity remained
absolutely passive.

Not only was this effect observed in the first or first few convulsions evoked, but
provided the division of the inferior peduncle had been fairly complete, and the lesion
had not involved, to any extent, the fibres of the superior peduncle, it could be
repeated time after time in a series of convulsions of considerable number.

cerebellum was divided. Tracing obtained from extensor muscles of fore-arm.
