It is proved by facts and
observations that animals partake of feelings, sensations, and intellectual faculties in
a higher degree, and approach more nearly to mankind in proportion as their brain
resem√æles more the human brain. An intimate connexion between the structure of
the brain and the intellectual faculties in the animal kingdom cannot be doubted. As the facts which we have advanced plainly prove that there are no well-marked
and essential differences between the brain of the Negro and European, we must con-
clude that no innate difference in the intellectual faculties can be admitted to exist
between them. This has been denied by philosophers*, naturalists+, and tra-
vellers, who assert that the Ethiopian race is naturally inferior to the European
in intellectual and moral powers. The data upon which such an opinion is based
are either erroneous suppositions and false deductions from anatomy and physiology,
or superficial observations on the intellectual and moral faculties of the Negroes,
made by partial or prejudiced travellers.
