Blectric wire, which in early experiments gave rise to curious and embarrassing
~Fariations in the galvanometer readings.
3 From the standardizing, or calibration, as it is often called, of the thermo-electric
ireuit in use, a formula is obtained, from which is calculated, from the “ corrected
&leflection ”{ of the galvanometer, the difference of temperatures of the two junctions
terms of centigrade temperatures on the air thermometer.§ Every temperature

* The material used by chemists for making diachylon sticking plaster answers admirably.

+ The best makers will not, I believe, guarantee to supply wniform platinum, in the physical sense of
the word uniform, knowing that it cannot be done, at present at all events.

+ The deflection is read off on a plane seale, and is corrected for the fact that the angle turned through
by the light ray is twice the angle of deflection of the magnet and mirror. In order to apply this
correction with facility, a table of numbers was constructed. The correction may now, however, be
easily applied by the use of the recently published “ Reductions-Tabellen zur Gauss-PoaGENDORFFSCHEN

lesung,” by Dr. Pavun Czermax. J. Sprincer, Berlin.
