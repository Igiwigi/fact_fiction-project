As might be expected, the rates of these ‘charged-current’ events are
much lower than those of the electromagnetic scatters, reflecting the relative strength of the
electromagentic and weak forces. However, as the energy scale increases, the rates converge, until
at around 10! ev, they become roughly equal. This effect, measured at HERA [20], reflects the fact


that most of the apparent difference in strength of the two forces at lower energies is due to the
different propagator masses (zero for the photon, 101! eV for the W and Z). Once the energy is
such that these masses are no longer important, a symmetry is restored, and the forces become
comparable in strength. This energy scale is known as the electroweak symmetry breaking scale.

(a) The Z and the neutrinos

Studies of the Z boson, resonantly produced in e*e~ collisions at the Large Electron-Positron
Collider (LEP) and Stanford Linear Collider [21], provide the precise information on many
features of electroweak physics.
