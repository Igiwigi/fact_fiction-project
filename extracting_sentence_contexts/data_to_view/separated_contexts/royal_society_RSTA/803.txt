Linearization of equation (3.2) leads to the expression that defines the kinetic growth
coefficient ju:

v= mr Gis = ATK = A(T; —T). (3.3)

For small undercoolings Tj ~ TL, and AGis ~ AH¢ AT/T;, with AH; the heat of fusion and AT the

undercooling of the melt, equation (3.3) is simplified to

In the case of pure metals, growth is collision-limited, i.e. Vo = Vs, with Vs the speed of sound,
of the order of Vs *1000ms~! [13]. In fact, this assumption is validated by measurement of the
dendrite growth velocity as a function of undercooling of pure nickel [14]. By contrast, in the
case of semiconductors, growth is diffusion-limited, ie. Vp =Vp, with Vp the atomic diffusive
speed [15].
