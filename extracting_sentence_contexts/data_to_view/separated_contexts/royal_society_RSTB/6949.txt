The general conclusion may
be reached that the muscles, the connective tissues, and the protected body organs need
relatively little cell replacement and so react only slightly to oestrogen stimulation, while
the epithelia covering the body surfaces, whether external on the skin or internal throughout
the alimentary canal and the Miillerian duct system, require frequent cell replacement
and consequently show a rapid and pronounced reaction to any increase in oestrogen blood
content. The extreme mitotic activity of the proliferating centres of the intestinal lymph
nodules is apparently due to the necessity for a constant supply of large numbers of
lymphocytes. The results obtained show clearly the existence of mitosis inhibitors, and indicate the
fact that there is a constantly varying interaction between them and the stimulation exerted
by the oestrogens. First, there is the force, termed the cell inertia, which must be overcome
before any tissue can react by mitosis to the presence of an oestrogen. In some organs,
such as the brain, this inertia is apparently so great that cell division is never able to occur,
while in others, such as the ureter, it is only overcome at full oestrus after the influence of
the oestrogen has been strongly exerted for some days.
