For passively mode-locked lasers, t is the normalized time in a frame of reference moving with
the group velocity, is the complex envelope of the optical field and z is the propagation distance
along the unfolded cavity. The meaning of the equation parameters on the left-hand side are: D
denotes the cavity dispersion, being anomalous when D > 0 and normal if D <0, and v is the
quintic refractive index coefficient. The coefficients of the dissipative terms on the right-hand side
of the equation are: 6 denotes linear gain/loss, f is the gain bandwidth coefficient, and Â¢ and jz
are the cubic and quintic gain/loss coefficients, respectively.

Several types of periodic solutions to this equation with unusual behaviours have been
obtained in the anomalous dispersion regime [46]. These solutions experienced periodic changes
mainly in their width, while keeping their peak amplitude almost constant. In contrast, the
solutions presented here change their peak amplitudes rather than their width. These amplitude
variations are extreme. In fact, this specific type of evolution with sharp peaks requires special
care in numerical procedures.

3. Pulsating solitons with extreme spikes

Extreme pulsations, observed firstly in the normal dispersion regime, are characterized by narrow
spikes developed on top of a roughly stationary soliton that serves as a pedestal supporting these
