5. Preparation of the Spinal Cord for Excitation.

Another mode of preparation remains to be referred to, that, namely, in which the
cord, when severed from its connection with the brain in order to investigate the
functions of the lower fragment, is to be excited.

Tt was necessary for these experiments to sever the cord as high as possible,
though, as a matter of fact, it was found advisable not to perform the operation at a
higher level than that of the 7th dorsal vertebra, otherwise, serious impairment
of respiratory and vaso-motor functions followed, and profound shock vitiated the
experimental results. When the upper end of the lower fragment of cord was to be
excited, this was further exposed, and a piece 5 mm. in length excised on the peri-
pheral side of the section, so that by looking into the gap the structures on the cut
surface of the cord could be seen and the excitation localised. The gap was made
absolutely dry with amadou and small pieces of sponge when the cord was to be
excited.

Finally, a series of experiments involved the division of the cord at two levels. A
portion was thus cut off, both from the brain and from the lumbar plexus, and prepared
so that one end could be connected with the non-polarisable electrodes and observed
