He gave much attention to hydrographic conditions outside the Irish Sea and to the
weather following these conditions.

In 1913 Matthews discussed the distribution of the salinities from the samples
taken on the Irish cruises during the years 1909-12. He calculated five grand mean
values for the salinity at each depth at each station, viz. one for each of the four times
of the year at which cruises were made and one for all the cruises made in the period.
Based on these grand mean values he published vertical sections and charts for the
sea-surface and bottom.

In all the above-mentioned discussions it is pointed out that, over most of the Irish
Sea proper, there is little change of salinity between the sea-surface and the bottom.
This fact greatly enhances the significance of a study of the salinities at the surface only.

In 1925 G, P. Farran and J. I. Spicer discussed some of the salinities which had been
determined for the Irish lightvessels. They calculated monthly mean values and
anomalies, and their results have been used in constructing table 3 below.

4. OBSERVATIONS USED IN THE PRESENT DISCUSSION

Table 1 gives a list of the stations with their positions and the periods of observation,
in so far as they have been used in the present investigation. The positions of the
stations are shown in figure 1. All the observations mentioned in ยง 2 are included
