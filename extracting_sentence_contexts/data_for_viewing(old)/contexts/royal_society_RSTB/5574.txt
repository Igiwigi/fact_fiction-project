other birds (SuRFAcE, 1912; Prart and Curtis, 1912; Kaupp, 1918; GIERSBERG,
1923 ; BuckNER et al., 1925). The resting tube in the pigeon possesses a well-developed
infundibulum, about half a centimetre in depth, that leads to an albumen-secreting
portion some five and a half centimetres long (figs. 3 and 4). This is followed by a short
isthmus, a few millimetres in length and a thick muscular uterus about a centimetre
long. The uterus connects with a short vagina. I have found the total length of
the resting duct to be about eight centimetres ; according to Krause (1922, p. 306)
it may be as short as 4-5 to 5 centimetres. Its interior is marked with numerous
longitudinal corrugations that become more pronounced and even convoluted in the
uterus. According to Harper (1904) the active duct may reach a length of 12 to
15 inches, four or five times as long as the resting organ. This proportional increase
agrees well with that shown in the tabulations given for other birds by GieRsBERG
(1923, pp. 3 and 6), and takes place notwithstanding the fact that the eggs of birds
are not stored in the oviducts as in the case of the tortoise, but are laid almost as soon
as the shell is formed. In the pigeon (HARPER, 1904, p. 352), the fowl (ParrERson,
1910, p. 107; Crew, 1926, p. 230), and probably in most other birds, only one egg at a
time ordinarily passes through the oviduct. Thus the uterus of the bird is principally
concerned with the production of the shelly covering of the egg and has little to do with
storage, one of its important functions in tortoises and in other reptiles. The oviduct
in the pigeon, is ciliated from end to end, like that in other birds (SurFacn, 1912 ;
Kaurp, 1918; Krause, 1922; GrersBere, 1923; Brapuey, 1928).

B. Functional.â€”It is not unusual to find a male and female Chrysemys picta in
copulation during the autumn. However, after such activities, the oviducts of these
turtles, according to CUNNINGHAM (1922, p. 60), contain no sperms, a condition that
