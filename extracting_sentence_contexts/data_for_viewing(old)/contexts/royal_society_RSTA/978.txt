exterior.


Outer billiards can be defined also in two-dimensional spherical and hyperbolic geometries.
In the spherical case, the inner and outer billiards are conjugated by the spherical duality. See [87]
for a survey.

Let us also mention two other non-conventional billiard systems: projective billiards [88] and
symplectic billiards [89].

(i) Around the Birkhoff conjecture

It is a classical fact (see, for instance, [83] and references therein) that the billiard in an ellipse
is integrable: the interior of the table is foliated by caustics, the confocal ellipses. Likewise, the
billiard inside an ellipsoid is Liouville integrable; e.g. [90,91].

The following is known as the Birkhoff conjecture; see [92].

Conjecture 4.1. If a neighbourhood of the boundary of the billiard table 2 C R? is foliated by : =
caustics, then the billiard curve y is an ellipse. a

We also formulate a generalized conjecture: if an open subset of the convex billiard table is foliated 73
by caustics, then this table is elliptic. DS
A polynomial version of Birkhoffâ€™s conjecture concerns the case when the integral of the :
billiard map is polynomial in the velocity. In the case of outer billiards, one modifies these 7
