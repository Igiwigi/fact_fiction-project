Relations between the “ fine’? vessels and the lymphatics.—In the work that I did upon
Lophius, I was led to the conclusion that the “ fine” vessel system communicated by
its terminal branches with the capillary networks of lymphatics in the skin and mucous

membranes, and with them alone. This conclusion was based on (1) my inability to
demonstrate any connection between these vessels and the blood vessels. (2) The fact
that good injections of the “ fine” vessels filled also a network of irregular capillaries
and larger vessels similar in character to lymphatics. (3) The fact that in these same
injections a certain quantity of the mass made its appearance in the main trunks and
sinuses of the lymph system.

Tt seems that in the Cod, although there is no connection between these vessels and
the veins, there is probably a very tenuous communication between them and the arteries.

The chief connection in the Cod is, however, certainly with the lymphatics. This has
been shown not only by the simple experiment of filling the “ fine ” vessels and noting
that the injection mass emerges after a time from one or other of the lymphatic trunks,
but by means of double injections of “ fine ’’ vessels and lymphatics checked by counter-
injections of the arteries and veins.
