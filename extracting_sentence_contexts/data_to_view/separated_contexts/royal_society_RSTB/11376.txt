TEBS enrichment analysis, to generate a more robust assessment Furthermore, the transcriptional profile of HLCs was
of the networks controlling the state of differentiation in HLCs. closer to that of immature hepatocytes (i.e. hepatoblasts)
Furthermore, the relative relevance of each factor can be ranked than to mature hepatocytes [47]. This is consistent
by the corresponding z-score. However, a weakness of this with the fact that liver zonation is achieved only after
algorithm is that it is biased towards best-studied transcriptional birth [49,50]. However, the HLCs in this study represent
regulatory networks. a unique differentiation procedure during _ self-

assembly into liver bud organoids and transplantation
into mouse liver [47,48]. Furthermore, RNA-Seq analysis
was conducted in only a few hundred cells.
