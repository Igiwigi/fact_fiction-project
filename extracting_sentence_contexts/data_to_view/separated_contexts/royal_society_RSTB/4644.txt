An attempt has rather been
made to show how complicated and contradictory is the evidence. Any explanation
that has been advanced has only been given with the greatest diffidence, not neces-
sarily as true, but rather as a tentative suggestion, sometimes only as a note of interro-
gation. Indeed, in more than one case, it has only been possible to record the facts,


AND THE CAUSE OF THEIR IRIDESCENT COLOURS. 61

In order to correlate the observations and experiments made in the course of this
work, with those of other investigators, an attempt has been made to analyse roughly
all the factors which determine the colours of insects. The fundamental colour must depend upon one or more of the four causes of
iridescence first mentioned, to which should be added that of pigmentation. A very
small physical change, however, in any one of the conditions may effect a profound
alteration in the colour.
