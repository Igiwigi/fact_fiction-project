From this struc-
ture it would appear, that in the eye of the cuttle-fish the ex-
terior parts of the humour are fibrous, the interior parts not ; s0 that the central part is a nucleus round which the fibrous
coverings' are placed. The preparations which demonstrate
these facts will be laid before the Society. As the structure of the crystalline humour in the cuttle-
fish differs in nothing from that of the same humour in other
animals, but in the distinctness of the fibrous appearance, Mr.
HunTER was led to consider that the exterior part in all of
them was similar, although no appearance of fibres could be
demonstrated. J

What I have here explained, I was acquainted with at the
time I had the honour of giving the Croox1an lecture, in
which I examined the different structures endowed with mus-
cular action; and was desirous that Mr. HuNTER would,
either of himself, or through me, communicate these observa-
tions to the Society ; but this he declined doing till he had
ascertained, by experiment, whether any muscular effect was
really produced ; and the hope of being assisted by Mr.
RamsDexn made him, from time to time, put off making his
experiments.
