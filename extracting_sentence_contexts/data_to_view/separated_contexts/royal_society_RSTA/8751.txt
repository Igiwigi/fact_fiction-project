The obvious way of attacking the problem of the distribution of kinetic energy among
the emitted electrons is to take the curves, such as figs. 4, 7 and 12, and find the incre-
ments in current corresponding to equally spaced intervals dV along the voltage axis. These will be proportional to the number of electrons whose energies lie between eV
and e (V + dV). This method will certainly give correctly, to the degree of accuracy
within which it can be operated and to the accuracy within which V is known, the
distribution of velocity among the electrons as they in fact reach the receiving electrode. VOL, CCOXXILâ€”aA, F
