inquiry completely attained ; the reason for not, at the time,

their support.

This inquiry, always regarded as highly important by phy-
siologists, has continued to engage their attention ; and, in the
BAKER1An Lecture for last year, Dr. YouxG has advanced some
experiments to prove, that the adjustment of the eye to different
distances, depends upon the crystalline lens : he considers the
results of the experiments made by Mr. RaMsDEN, upon BEn-
JAMIN CLERK's eyes, as inconclusive; and the phenomena met


when deprived of the Crystalline Lens. 5
