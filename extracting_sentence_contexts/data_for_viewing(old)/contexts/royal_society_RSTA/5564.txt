where the P‘(5x) probability distribution function also factorizes for higher dimensions
equivalently to the single Gaussian distribution function as given in equation (3.2). The one-
dimensional Poisson weighted sum of Gaussians probability distribution function P%,(5x) is then
given by

where 6X is the displacement in one dimension, ((5xq)*) is the second-order moment, Ug is the
mean velocity, c is the number of occurrences and A is the average number of collisions. The fact

that the new displacement distribution function is just a sum of Gaussians makes the calculation
of the new MDLG equilibrium functions surprisingly simple. Thus, we obtain

The A, similar to equation (3.3), is given by
