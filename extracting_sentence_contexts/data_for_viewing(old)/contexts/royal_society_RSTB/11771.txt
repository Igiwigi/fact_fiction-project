oping colon cancer [52]. Fourteen patients with FAP were
treated with BRBs daily for nine months. Seven patients
received BRB powder orally plus two BRB suppositories,
whereas another seven patients received suppositories
together with an oral placebo. Intervention with suppositories
was sufficient to reduce polyp number and burden at the end
of the study. Three of the 14 patients did not respond to the
intervention. In colon tissue of responders, DNMT1 expression
(tumours) and p16 promoter methylation (tumours and adja-
cent normal tissue) were significantly reduced at the end of
the study compared with baseline levels, whereas no changes
were detected in the three non-responding patients [52]. The
fact that the patients responded differently to the local effects
of BRB suppositories indicate that BRB components either are
metabolized by the gut microbiota (see Ellagitannins and uro-
lithins below) or might influence the gut microbial
composition with long-term beneficial effects. These hypoth-
eses were addressed in several rodent studies investigating
diets enriched with 5% BRBs in rats [55] and mice [53,54]. In
faeces of Apemin! * mice, a mouse model of human FAP, BRB
intervention for eight weeks significantly increased Lactobacil-
lus and Bacteroidaceae populations determined by quantitative
polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) using population-specific
primers, whereas Bifidobacteriales and Ruminococcus popu-
lations were not changed [53]. Similarly, in a study in F-344
