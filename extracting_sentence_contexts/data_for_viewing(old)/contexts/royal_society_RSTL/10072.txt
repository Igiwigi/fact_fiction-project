Value of GK corrected for level and torsion.

Calling the corrected value GK, we have

GK(1+ tan 1) __ 1:00019
GR=- 1+T â€”1-000075

GK

80 that
log GR=8-17686

The corrections are in fact almost insensible.

Cateutation of U.

In this we take for GK the value just found. For L we take the mean of the
values found by @ priori calculation and by direct experiment, 1.e.,

1=2:4026 X 108.
Thus
