It may be remarked that a, 6, c, 4 being real, the dirigent circle is real; the equation
may, in fact, be written

Þ #+4=U(a+8)+(a+} +(a+d)+(b+&Y+(0+4)+(c+4}).

= Considering the equation of the Cartesian under the form

= (a+#—&z) +16A(z—m)=0,

the centre of the dirigent circle z*+y*—«=0 must be considered as a real point, but «
Zmay be positive or negative, #. e. the radius may be either a real or a pure imaginary
Sdistance : the coefficients A, m must be real, the directrix is therefore a real line. The
Zequation shows that for all points of the curve z—m is always negative or always positive,
