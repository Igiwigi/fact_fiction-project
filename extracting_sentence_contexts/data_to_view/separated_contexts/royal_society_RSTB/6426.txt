It may be presumed, therefore,
that cell differentiation at the expense of regenerating cells (r.c.) takes place, thus
suggesting their recent formation from regenerative cells. The next question is
whether there is a complete or partial replacement of digestive cells accompanying
each moult. The facts given by Wacner are insufficient to lead to any definite
conclusion as to complete replacement, and I have not followed the changes in all
the three different larval stages, but that partial replacement accompanies each
moult is certain. The musculature of the mesenteron (fig. 22) is more weakly developed than in
the stomodaeum and the proctodaeum. It consists of inner fine circular fibres
(c.m.) and outer closely placed numerous longitudinal fibres (/.m.).

(C) Tue PrRocropAEUM

The proctodaeum (fig. 35) commences in the beginning of the seventh abdominal
segment and is differentiated into five regions : (a) the pylorus (py.), (4) the ileum
(il.), (c) the colon (co.), (d) the rectal sac (r.s.), and (e) the rectum proper (r.).

(a) The pylorus (py.) is a well-defined sub-spherical chamber which lies immedi-
ately behind the mesenteron.
