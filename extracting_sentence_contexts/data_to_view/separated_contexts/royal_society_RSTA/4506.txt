147 The net result of these five operations is to fix the upper limit of the heat of occlu-
sion of oxygen at 10 K per gram. From the fact that in Operation 4 some oxygen
was extracted from the tube, we may suppose that at this stage most, if not all, the
hydrogen had been removed as water, and that the number 15°8 is obtained because
the effect due to true occlusion preponderates over that due to the formation of
water. From the smallness of the quantity of oxygen occluded in Operation 5, no
great reliance can be placed on the value 10 K, taken singly, but in all probability
we are dealing in this case with true occlusion. In Operation 6, 47°59 cub.
