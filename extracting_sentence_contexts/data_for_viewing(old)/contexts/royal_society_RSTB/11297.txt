1. Human development requires culture

Humans stand out among other animals because we adapt to new environments
both by being clever innovators [1] and through the accumulation of cultural
knowledge across generations [2,3]. Social learning, including intensive forms
such as teaching [4-6], can facilitate cumulative cultural evolution. In fact, low-
cost social learning mechanisms, as well as sources of innovation, are prerequisites
for the evolution of cumulative culture. For this reason, social learning mechan-
isms are central to the understanding of cultural evolution—and cultural
evolution is key to explaining why and how human ontogeny is so very flexible.
Culture is a human universal: all societies have shared knowledge, practices,
beliefs and rituals that are transmitted socially. At the same time, culture is also a
source of psychological and behavioural variation both within and across popu-
lations. Developmental processes that are sensitive to socio-environmental

developmental processes that vary in adaptive ways in terms of the degree and

nature of their flexibility [9]. Elaborating on the relationship between culture
