division is completed, lying in the cytoplasm near the boundary between the two
cells (text-fig. 16).

“In the second segmentation division, a similar process takes place, but it is usually
rather less pronounced ; the vesicles are, on the whole, smaller, and we doubt whether
complete chromosomes ever become vesicular.” A

It is impossible to say from a study of the hybrid eggs whether the eliminated
chromosomes are derived from the male or female parent. A study of the effects of
hypertonic sea-water on the normally fertilized eggs of the two species has, however,
revealed considerable evidence in support of the assumption that the vesicles in the
hybrid #. acutus 2 x FE. esculentus f are derived from the female parent [Gray (35).
This hypothesis receives considerable support from the fact that the elimination of
chromosomes by means of “vesicle” formation is restricted to those hybrids derived
from E. acutus eggs only—vesicles being only found in the crosses E. acutus 2
x E. esculentus ¢ and in E. acutus? xX E. miliaris ¢.

2. E. acutus and E. miliaris Hybrids—

(a) E. acutus 2 Xx E. miliaris $ (1911 and 1912).—In this cross a small number
of chromosomes show a varying tendency to swell and form vesicles in the early
stages of the first division; where the tendency is pronounced this may cause
failure to divide in the metapbase, and they are carried to one or other pole.
Exceedingly small vesicles are sometimes eliminated, but this process is not frequent
and conspicuous, as it is in the cross £. acutus? x FE. esculentus g. In the later
