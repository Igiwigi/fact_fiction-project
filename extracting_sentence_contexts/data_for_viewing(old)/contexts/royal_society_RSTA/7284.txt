For the case of an incident wave originating inside the channel, the value of F, for the

particular case §) = —7 is required. Its operational form is readily deduced from equation
(13):
1 neo
F,= F(") exp [ —prcos a) | , e PPG (0<0<m) |
(ar) sin 1d .
e(27r)' sin 10 (28)

fe -F(2)' exp [—preos6] |

Such a wave will emanate from each lip of the channel, F\? being given by (28) and F®
being deduced from the fact that the resulting potential from the two waves is symmetrical
about the centre line of the channel. Thus, considering the interval 0<6<z and remembering
that ;? does not penetrate into the region 41<0<n, we find that the contribution to the
potential outside the channel is

FP+FP (0<0< 271); |

Come daa) (-n<0<0),
