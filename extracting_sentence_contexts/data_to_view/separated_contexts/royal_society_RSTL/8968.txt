These systems are mutually exclusive, and
cannot both be true. Now we are not in a position to assert that the one of these
systems is true and the other false. If 80, one 8ystem would be applicable and the other
inapplicable to the facts, and in the construction of our system we should get rid of
hypothesis altogether. Tt is rarely, however, indeed that in any case 8uch a scientific
construction is practicable. But failing this, and admitting the inadequacy of our
information, we may till ask, can we give a reasonable preference to the one or the
other system ?
