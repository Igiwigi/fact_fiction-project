there are many “Soufriéres” discharging sulphurous gases. The crater of Pelée
contained a “ Soufriére ” of this kind, and Professor Lacrorx has given a full account
of the products of fumarole action in Martinique. It is rather a remarkable fact that of all the specimens which we collected of older
andesitic rocks ejected during the 1902 eruptions only one shows contact alteration. The fresher specimens could not be expected to suffer much change by being again
raised to the temperature at which they consolidated. With the weathered rocks it
is different, for their secondary minerals would certainly be modified had they been
enveloped in the new incandescent lava.
