During the period between the 4th and 5th day of incubation of Larus, when the
completion of the formation of the perichordal tube and its differentiation into primary
vertebral and intervertebral bodies occurs, the zones of growth are displaced from the
vertebral to the intervertebral bodies. The result of this is the constriction of the inter-
vertebral portion of the notochord contained in the intervertebral bodies. Such a
condition of things in Larus lasts till the 8th day of incubation and is fully similar to
that described by the above-named authors for the corresponding stages in the chick.*

It is of interest to notice that the inversion in the disposition of the dilatations and
constrictions of the notochord described by Grcenpaur and Frorier in 8-day chick
could not be observed in Larus at a corresponding age.

* The fact that the chick hatches on the 21st and Larus canus on the 23rd day of incubation makes it
probable that the corresponding stages of development in both birds are almost simultaneous. This renders
the comparison of developmental stages in both hirds easier and the conclusion drawn therefrom more
certain.

The stage of 3 dilatations and 4 constrictions described by GecENBauR and Frortep
in chick from the 9th and 10th day onwards is also represented in Larus, but it begins on
the 8th day of incubation—somewhat earlier than might be expected in comparison with
