Bone GROWING IN SPONGE. Is there any direct evidence to show that transplanted living bone actually grows
and proliferates instead of forming, like blood-clot, a passive framework for the
granulation tissue to penetrate, and which framework will then be absorbed ? In this relation an interesting fact was observed, where a minute portion of bone
broken off from the deeper layers of a new osseous growth, far removed from any
periosteal connection, was found growing in the midst of a sponge filled with
granulation tissue. After removal from the fibula of a central sequestrum, measuring 3 inches in
length, a hollow cylinder of new osseous tissue was left. Into this hollow cylinder
a piece of decalcified, aseptic, specially prepared sponge (Professor Hamiuronâ€™s
method) was being introduced, when it became entangled on an osseous spicule
projecting from the central aspect of the new bone into the lumen of the hollow
cylinder.
