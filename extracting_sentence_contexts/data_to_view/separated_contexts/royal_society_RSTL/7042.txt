The darkest are the twenty-eighth and twenty-ninth, succeeding
the lightest ones. The cause producing these bands and their shading by dark transverse lines is

them. This may be concluded, for instance, from the fact that the shadow which
darkens the nineteenth and twentieth bands, without entirely destroying their limits,
Spreads at the same time over the neighbouring third part of the preceding eighteenth
