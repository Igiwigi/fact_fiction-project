The main difference in the predicted wave amplitudes results from


deviations between the assumptions on the initial wave heights. While Weiss et al. [48] predict
wave heights of the order of a couple of hundred metres in the near field, Shuvalov & Gresonde
[39] determined wave heights of up to 1000 m close to the point of impact. These large differences
most likely result from the fact that waves close to the point of impact are highly nonlinear, break
and form bores, which makes it difficult to quantify the process. Such turbulent behaviour cannot
be resolved sufficiently by existing hydrocode simulations and more appropriate modelling tools
are required to quantify wave behaviour near to intermediate distance (10-100 km) from the point
of impact.

5. Conclusion

Meteorite impacts pose a natural threat to society.
