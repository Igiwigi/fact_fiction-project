q On shade to sun transitions, this study has shown that several
Ss minutes are required for the wheat flag leaf to re-attain maxi-
& mum photosynthetic efficiency (figure 1b). At the level of leaf
% biochemical limitations, the apparent maximum activity of

Rubisco (Vmax) limits this rate of induction, implying acti-
vation of this enzyme as the key factor, rather than
regeneration of the RuBP CO, acceptor molecule (J). This
was clearly indicated by the fact that ¢; tan; Was well above
the actual c,; when c, was at the current atmospheric level of
400 pmol mol” and at the actual greenhouse growth c, of
449 pmol mol! (figures 3 and 4c). In contrast to previous
studies [4], stomatal limitation plays a role in the speed of
induction, declining from ca 0.5 in the first 3 min to about 0.3
at steady state, indicating that about 20% of the lag is due to
stomatal movement (figure 5c). This is also indicated by the
fact that when the leaf is at the ambient c, of 400 ppm through-
out, c, declines to about 200 pmol mol! before recovering to ca
230 pmol mol’ at steady state (figure 5b). Combining the ray
tracing model of Zhu et al. [25] and the modelled kinetics of
Rubisco de-activation and activation on sun-to-shade-to-sun
