786 SIR B. C. BRODIE ON THE CALCULUS OF CHEMICAL, OPERATIONS.

It is frequently asserted that our present hypothesis affords a clear and simple expla-
nation of chemical phenomena, which is the evidence of its truth. Now it may be con-
sidered that such an explanation was perhaps afforded of the incomplete system of facts
known to Darron, but with our present knowledge this account can no longer be
regarded as satisfactory. The most important feature in our modern system is the
identification of the weight of the chemical molecule with the weight of the unit of
gaseous volume, to which we are brought by physical as well as chemical considerations.
This great simplification was practically introduced by LauURExNT and GERHARDY, and it
is generally allowed that this assumption affords the snrest basis of chemical theory.
Now the atomic theory of DaLTox accounts for the fact that the weight of the chemical
molecule may be regarded as consisting of an integral number of the atomic weights of
those elemental bodies into which it can finally be decomposed. But this is not the
only limitation with which we are acquainted. The chemists before mentioned dis-
covered the existence of a peculiar numerical relation between the atomic weights of
certain elemental bodies, when combined in the chemical molecule, to which they gave
