of nitrogen. A third and still more simple mode of
obtaining the nitride is that of exposing the trioxide to the action of ammonia gas at a
white heat. It is a remarkable fact, and one of which we know of but two other examples,

nitrogen. THE CHLORIDES OF VANADIUM. L have succeeded in preparing three chlorides of vanadium, viz.
