persistent in snow-covered areas, as is the case in winter in the Sierra Nevada.
Sometimes, software errors in the MODIS data processing stream have
contaminated data for a week or two. Occasional noisy images appear
throughout the history of MODIS.

When clouds do not obscure the pixels, viewing angles can perturb the signal.
Although the MOD09 product is resampled at 500 m resolution, in fact, the pixels
are elongated in both the along-track and cross-track directions at off-nadir views.
At the edge of the scan, the pixel is approximately 10 times as large as at nadir,
elongated by factors of 2 and 5 in the along-track and cross-track directions,
respectively. Therefore, the putative values of the MOD09 reflectance, and thereby
the derived snow cover, incorporate values in neighbouring pixels. The neighbours
may have more or less snow cover, so the error is not systematic. Topography and
forest cover also affect the viewing geometry. Within a given viewing area, there
can be considerable subpixel topographic variability. In forested areas, a sensor
‘sees’ greater fractions of the underlying ground at near-nadir views and lesser
fractions as the view angle increases (Nolin 2004). Finally, MODSCAG probably
has imperfections, especially at large view angles where the effect of subpixel
topographic variability is amplified.
