Support for this view is obtained from the recollection
that, in both form acuity and comparison acuity, it is the perception of a small difference
of light intensity on which both really depend. But similar reasoning applies to the green-
and the blue-sensitive cones. Now whole clusters might well point in slightly different
directions, in fact it would be an extraordinary thing if they did not. We have then, in the
cluster hypothesis, a feasible explanation of this retinal direction effect.

(124) The colours of an intermittent point source

A small intermittent point source of light was fixed by one eye, and was given small
irregular jerking movements. The result was that colour changes, sometimes pink and
sometimes pale blue-green, were observed.
