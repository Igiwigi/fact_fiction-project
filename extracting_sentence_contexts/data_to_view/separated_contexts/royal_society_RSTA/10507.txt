With Li as indicator the copper also lags behind the boundary, but as has been
previously mentioned, the colour shows no sign of entirely fading out, and when
there exists a column 6 centims. long of Li,SO, solution, the blue colour of the
copper left behind is perfectly uniform, but lighter in colour than the measured
solution. On examining the lithium chloride jelly after the experiment, it was
found that copper had entered it for a distance of between 3-35 millims., thus
indicating the passage of the copper to the anode as complex anion. This behaviour
is possibly associated with the fact that the double sulphates of copper belong to
the class Mâ€™,Cu (SO,)., and hence a complex Cu(SQ,), will be stable in the presence
of a monad cation such as Li, but not if the cation is of the type of Mg. The method described in the preceding pages gives a simple and accurate means
of determining the transport number of the simplest type of salts; in its present
form it is applicable only to more concentrated solutions. It is hoped to modify
it in such a manner as to permit of the measurement of more dilute solutions.
