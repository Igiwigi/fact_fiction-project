58. It may be objected that the application of the principle to ionized solutions
would compel us to admit the possible theoretical existence of a gas consisting of
ions: but that is not really so, because the argument only compares one state of
dilution with another. Yet on the other hand there is the hypothesis, supported by
Brtuvâ€™s work on optical equivalents, that under certain circumstances oxygen is a
tetrad element, so that the molecule H,O can take up sufficient ions to form another
saturated molecule of type H, = O= X, and that therein lies the cause of the
regular ionization current produced by solution in water (the ions X being free only
when passing from one such combination to another), as contrasted with the irregular
ionization of free gases. Changes of valency in an element remain unexplained, but
their occurrence is now usually accepted as matter of fact.* The function of the
osmotic diaphragm is merely passive, to prevent mixture by diffusion and consequent
loss of mechanical availability. In a mutual solution of two substances, it is usually
only the one that is present in large excess that gets through the diaphragm in
purity: if it should prove to be a general Jaw that the dialyzing action is only
complete when there is such large excess, it would be strong evidence for the view
that the molecules dissolved in it form the nuclei of loose molecular complexes which
are too large and permanent to get through, while the free solvent in which the
molecules are not thus grouped is not so hindered.

When a solution is made more and more dilute, there comes a stage when it would
