In
Bther words f is not an additive quantity, for the configuration of the molecule plays
@part in the distribution of energy. My experiments would not be inconsistent with the supposition that the configura-

tion is the sole feature that fixes the distribution, but until more definite evidence is
obtained—especially with regard to the physical significance of radicles—this must

| _ It was pointed out many years ago by NAuMANN, when experimental evidence was
‘Seanty, that 8 divided by the number of atoms in the molecule was nearly equal
to 33. If this held generally, it would be an important fact, for it would point to

approximation to ‘33, but no more. Even allowing for the exaggeration of
experimental error by the nature of the equation connecting 8 and y, it can no}
said that the intramolecular energy is proportional to the number of atoms in
