But there is no complete continuity between the two:
the substances of bouton and dendrite often stain very differently, so that it is quite
clear that they do not mingle. Moreover, in many preparations, a narrow space, a
few microns in width, appears between the end foot and the cell surface. This space
is probably an artefact, but the fact that the two members of the synapse can separate
in this way indicates the absence of mingling of their substances. The full implications
of this arrangements are discussed on p. 494. The most interesting feature is the presence
of a discontinuity such that an impulse passing over the bouton would not be expected
to have the same effect on the dendrite as it would have on a portion of neuroplasm
with which it was fully continuous.
