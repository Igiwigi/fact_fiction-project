It
has indeed been lately asserted that a solution of the nentral nitrate may be obtained
by precipitating the chloride with nitrate of silver. This is a mistake, as the usual
decomposition occurs in this case. In fact, the solution of the supposed neutral
nitrate, instead of the acid reaction of the chloride from which it is formed, intensely
reddens litmus paper. If a similar experiment be made with other metallic chlorides,
capable of forming neutral nitrates, no perceptible change of reaction will be found
to occur, These observations fully explain the anomalies which I formerly pointed
out in the action of the dilute acids on the red oxide of mercury. E2
