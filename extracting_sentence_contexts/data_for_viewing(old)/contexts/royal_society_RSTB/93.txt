was initiated by Worontrn, who examined those of the Lupin, and found the cells in
the interior of the swellings filled with a slimy colourless matrix in which Bacteria-like
granules were embedded : the “ Bacteria” were found to increase, in proportion to
the rest of the matrix, as the section receded from the growing apex of the swelling.
In a paragraph at the end of his paper on Plasmodiophora,** in 1878, Woronin
practically retracted his previous opinion that the above granular bodies are really
Bacteria or Vibrios, and regarded it as highly probable that a Plasmodiophora, or
similar parasite, would be found to be the exciting agent.

Meanwhile, in 1874, Errksson had published a masterly investigation of the occur-
rence, form, structure, and growth of the swellings on the roots of Leguminosz.tt
Their forms differ on the roots of different species, but are remarkably constant in the
case of any one species. Perhaps the most striking fact about them is their ubiquity,
confirmed subsequently by Franx.{{ They are found on the roots of species of all the
