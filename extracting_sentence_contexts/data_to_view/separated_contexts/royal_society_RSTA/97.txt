However, it is to be emphasized that the results of these calculations

are subject to large errors, for several reasons previously specified. On this point the results
of this paper do not agree with the deductions of Tsien et al., since they indicate that in all
cases the estimated mass is consistent with a single mass number of 4. If the results of all the experiments are considered, the following facts concerning the
emission of light nuclei in the fission of U2" by slow neutrons may be regarded as established:

(i) A light nueleus is emitted in approximately 1 % of fission events, and in one-quarter
of these cases the range exceeds that of the fission fragments. :

(ii) The range of the light nucleus takes all values up to a limit exceeding 55cm.
