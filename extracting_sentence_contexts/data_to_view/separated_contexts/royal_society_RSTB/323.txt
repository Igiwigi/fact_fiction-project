For example, particulars will be given of the constant modification of
Cardium edule consequent upon the drying up of the lakes in which they were, while
Dreissena polymorpha and Hydrobia ulve do not appear to have been affected. It
may be here remarked that the general variability of a form, as Dreissena polymorpha,
does not appear to predispose it to assume a new form for a given change of condition. In view of the fact that definite variations have been shown to be produced in
Cardium edule by change in the composition of the water, it next becomes desirable
to know to what extent these changes would be maintained if the conditions were
altered back again to their original state. Upon this point I have no evidence ; but
that the animals would, if they lived and propagated, ultimately regain their former
structure appears probable ; for, since it can be shown that certain variations are
constantly produced by water of certain constitution, it practically follows that the
maintenance of these variations depends also on the same cause. It would, however,
be of the greatest interest to ascertain the length of time and the number of genera-
tions necessary to effect these changes,

The specimens forming the subject of this paper were collected in the district of the
Aral Sea and in Egypt.
