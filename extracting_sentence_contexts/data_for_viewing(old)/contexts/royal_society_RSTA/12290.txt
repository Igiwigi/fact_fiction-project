ented on. The variation of the thermal resistance of platinum with temperature
‘Bas not, as far as we can learn, been experimentally examined, nor does it appear to
‘$e even known whether the thermal resistance of platinum increases with tempe-
£ature, as does the thermal resistance of iron, or diminishes with the rise of
®emperature, as does the thermal resistance of copper and German silver. Under
these circumstances we decided to assume that the thermal resistance of platinum

vas a constant, and had the value it is known to possess at ordinary temperatures,
rand to see what sort of result a mathematical assumption based on this result would
Bead to.

As a matter of fact, even the thermal conductivity of platinum at ordinary tempera-

ures is not stated explicitly in books, but it can be easily arrived at indirectly. For
we find that WrepEMANN and Franz determined that

Thermal conductivity of platinum _ _8°2
Thermal conductivity of copper = 773°

and in the article “ Heat” in the ‘ Encyclopedia Britannica,’ the value of the thermal
conductivity of copper, 0°96 as determined by Anasrrom, is stated to be trustworthy.
From these numbers we deduce that the thermal resistance of platinum, at ordinary
temperatures, is 9°858, which is the value we have taken for ¢ (¢).
