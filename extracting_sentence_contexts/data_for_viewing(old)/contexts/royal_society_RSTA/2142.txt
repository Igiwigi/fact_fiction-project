then the upper bound on the length of the core dictionary we can encode is 422 million items.

5. Additional semantic object manipulations

In order to complete the description of the proposed system, we need to cover two further issues:
(i) How does the system cope with uncertainty? (ii) Since the system is semi-holographic how
does the system map multi-item chains to single base items when necessary? In this work, we
provide some cursory answers as these questions merit substantially deeper study in the own
right.

Dealing with uncertainty: the implementation of de-noising will strongly depend on the form
of the uncertainty present in the system. We may define uncertainty as a probability distribution
that encodes how likely it is to obtain semantic object x’ when in fact, the ground truth is x. For
example, if the probability density only depends on the ‘circular distance’ (equation (3.3)) between
the x and x’ objects® we may use an adaptation of element-wise average for de-noising. The
average is computed as the mid-point along the geodesic. In particular, for a € Z/p let also denote
by the same symbols a=a+0-p its representative in Z. Also denote by A = ceil(dist, (a, b)/2).
For a,b € Z/p, if |b — a| <p — |b —al, pick a smaller representative with respect to the standard
ordering on Z (say, it is a), then avg(a,b) =a + A. If the alternative inequality happens, pick the

greater representative (say, it is b), then avg(a,b) = (b + A) mod p. In general, for items a,b € B, we
define the average as the element-wise average.
