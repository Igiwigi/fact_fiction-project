Thus even in the above delicate case is the formula of Professor TnowsoN com-
pletely verified. The mathematical investigation of the thermo-elastic qualities of
metals has enabled my illustrious friend to predict with certainty a whole class of highly
interesting phenomena. To him especially do we owe the important advance which has
been recently made to a new era in the history of science, when the famous philoso-
phical system of Bacoy will be to a great extent superseded, and when, instead of
arriving at discovery by induction from experiment, we shall obtain our largest acces-
Sions of new facts by reasoning deductively from fundamental principles. DR. JOULE ON SOME THERMO-DYNAMIC PROPERTIES OF SOLIDS. 131
