H. JEANS ON THE STABILITY OF A SPHERICAL NEBULA.

boundary, will, in every configuration of the gas, satisfy our equations with p = 0. Such a motion, in fact, simply leads to a configuration which is physically
indistinguishable from the initial configuration, and in which the potential energy
remains unaltered. The motion which we have found from our equations is the sum
of a motion of this kind, and a true limiting vibration. It is impossible to separate
the two motions, except by considering vibrations of frequency different from zero,
but fortunately the question is not one of any importance.
