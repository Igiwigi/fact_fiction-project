EZ are 22?, 24, 28? of contraction, on breaking the inverse circuit, and these numbers
S were the same whether the current were passed for one second only, or as long as
= twenty seconds or thirty seconds. On touching one wire with the other very quickly,
EZ the contractions in the same circumstances were only 4Â®, 6?, 8*.
When instead of a nerve, the excitability of which is very great, we choose for our
S experiments one in which this is considerably diminished,-it is easy to prove that the
-= contraction produced by the inverse current ceasing to pass increases, within certain
5 limits, proportionally to the time of the passage of the current. To bring the nerve
Q to this state of excitability, it may be either left to itself for a long time, or be sti-
mulated by frequent intermitted currents in rapid suecession. Before detailing the
results which follow, it is necessary to mention what happens when a nerve has been
expoxsed for a long time to the passage of the direct current, or to repeated actions
of this current in those cases in which the nerve is left to itself. In fact, in order
to be able to measure what is dne to the action of the inverse current, we imust first
know what is the effect upon the nerve of its being left to itself, after the direct cnr-
rent has ceased to act upon it.
Mamax1xt had already found that a frog which has lost the faculty of contracting
apon passing the current, re-acquires it on being left to itseif for five seconds. I have

some minutes to the passage of the direct current : the contraction, which was 20? at
