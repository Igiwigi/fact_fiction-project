think, a most significant fact that by the time the embryo has reached a length of
5-8 mm., this separation has been completely effected with the result that we now have
established a relatively large yolk-sac with a complete wall of its own and a continuous
outer chorionic membrane bounding the embryonal formation and what is even more
remarkable than its early separation is the fact that this membrane is already vascularised
throughout its entire extent by allantoic vessels (Pl. 2, fig. 17, w.vl. cf. also text-fig. 2,

u.v.). Prior to the extension of the ccelom, the vitelline vessels ramify in the unsplit
mesoderm of the omphalopleure and, as the latter is in intimate attachment with the
uterine epithelium, there exists temporarily in the earlier embryonic stages, a simple
