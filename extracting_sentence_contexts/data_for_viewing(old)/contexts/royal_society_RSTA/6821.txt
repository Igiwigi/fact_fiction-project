My (A, +n)

is called the nth (complete) section of A (its rows and columns are numbered from 0 to n), and
quantities connected with the solution of (1-11) will generally bear a superscript or a suffix 7.
The (+ 1)-rowed unit matrix will be denoted by J. We observe that all row-sums of A”
are zero, except the last, which is equal to —A,,.

The solution of (1-11) with the appropriate initial conditions .Y(0) = 7” can be written

We shall now show that /}/?(¢) >0 when ¢>0. In fact, let
gq = max (Ap, Ay FAs «+05 Ay Mp)

Then M = tq1 + tam

is a matrix all of whose elements are non-negative. From the definition as a power series
it is clear that the elements of exp M are likewise non-negative. Hence so also are the

elements of exp (tA) = exp (—tq1™) exp M,

since exp (—/q J) = exp (—tq) I.
Thus we have oer: -
