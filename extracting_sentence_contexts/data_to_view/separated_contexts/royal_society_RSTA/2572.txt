A second reason for the comparative scarcity of deep explanation may be that, since the ea
conversation is online, participants usually do not know each other; additionally many cues .
such as tone and body language are not represented, and so it is harder to build up a picture
of individual knowledge bases. Thirdly, also due to the fact that the conversation occurs online
in real-time, often with parallel threads, participants are under time-pressure, and therefore may
not articulate lack of understanding as much as they would in a slower-moving conversation. The
public nature of the conversation may also be a factor here. There was no pattern as to mathematical context or purposive element in the deep
explanations.
