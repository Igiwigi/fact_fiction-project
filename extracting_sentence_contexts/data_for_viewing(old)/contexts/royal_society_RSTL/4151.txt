A spheroid of silica was formed by fusing pulverized silica on to a platinum wire,
80 as to cover it for the length of 0'4 of an inch; when this was plunged into
the hot water and again fused in the oxyhydrogen blowpipe, it constantly became
frothed with small bubbles of vapour, and after a few experiments generally separated
in fissures; in the experiment which was continued for the longest time without
disintegration, the gas given off contained 0-15 of oxyhydrogen gas ; from the whole
result I believe there is an action of the water on the eilica (probably forming a
bydrate decomposable by heat) which is a bar to satisfactory results. With other
oxides, at least such as would bear an intense heat, the difficulties were still more
insnperable. PrigsTLEY has shown that water will corrode glass, and if I mistake
not, others have shown the same effect produced on silica.

Although, as applied to the facts detailed, I attached no further meaning to the
title of my paper than that which I have above stated, yet in one or two theoretical
inferences I have certainly gone further ; for instance, when I suppose the possibility
or probability of mechanical rarefaction producing the same effects as heat, here
(although I do not, indeed I cannot conceive the existence of heat without matter)
I certainly abstract from the proposition any consideration of solid matter. In order
to ascertain how far this view might be founded on truth, I had thought of making
a few experiments on the effect of mechanical rarefaction on the tendency of gases
to combine, but (in addition to the interference of necessary occupations) I find that
M. ps Grorrnvs has already experimented on the point ; his experiments,. as far as
they go, corroborate the views I have put forth.

He finds* that mixed gases, such as chlorine and hydrogen, or oxygen and hydro-
