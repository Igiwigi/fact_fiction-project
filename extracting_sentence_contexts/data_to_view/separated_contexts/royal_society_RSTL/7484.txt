spectrum is extremely faint, except just at the nucleus, and eyen there it is pretty faint. When therefore we consider that a great part of the light of the Huygenian region of
the nebula in Orion, the brightest parts of which are probably not much, if at all

brighter than the nuclei of snch nebulz as 2373, 2377, goes to form a gaseous spectrum,

we can hardly expect that the remaining light could produce any but the feeblest conti-
nuous spectrum. As a further confirmation of this view, it may be mentioned that on one
occasion the spectrum of this nebula was examined in bright moonlight ; the light was
80 strong that the Huygenian region was scarcely visible; in fact its boundaries were
not more apparent than the boundary of the proboscis major at 131 is on a dark night ;
yet although the three gaseous lines of the nebula were very fairly seen, no continuous
spectrum from the moonlight, which was probably equal in intensity to the light of the
nebula, could be detected. This observation, however, was not 80 satisfactory as I could have wished, as a haze
which s00n after eclipsed the nebula was beginning to come on at the time. Besides the central parts of the nebula, the nebula Mairiani was examined with the
spectroscope, and a gaseous spectrum seen near the star 108.
