that both processes do occur.

On the other hand, we have known for some time that comets fragment, very occasionally due
to new tidal stresses as in the case of D/Shoemaker-Levy 9, but usually without an immediate,
extrinsic cause. The details of fragmentation vary widely [16] but it is likely related most
commonly to thermal stresses because it is most commonly seen in the case of Sun-grazing
and Sun-skirting comets [17]. The Sun-grazing and Sun-skirting comets do not break up at
or necessarily even near perihelion, but the ultimate source of the breakup is plausibly due
ultimately to the heating at perihelion, which takes time to propagate inward. In other cases,
such as comet LINEAR (C/1999 S4), which totally disrupted, it might plausibly be due to heating
as it approached perihelion but it might also be due to rotational spin-up, given the absence of
rapidly rotating nuclei [18]. However attractive these mechanisms are, we must remember that
none of them is proven. Nevertheless, the existence of frequent splitting highlights the fact that
cometary nuclei are very weak on scales large compared with a KOSI-layer.

Icy patches have been observed previously on the surface of comets Tempel 1 and Hartley
2 [19,20], although understanding the details, beyond grain size and amount of ice, was mostly
speculative, with both bulk ice and frosts from the previous night being proposed. Rosetta has
shown for the first time that at least some of these icy patches are frost, condensing during local
night, from either vapour transported from below the surface or residual cooling gas above the
surface, and disappearing very soon after sunrise [21,22]. Rosetta has also shown longer lasting
deposits on and at the bases of cliffs [23], and, by inference from colours, at many locations and
having limited lifetimes [22]. It is still debatable whether this implies that ice in the nucleus is
patchy rather than in large blocks.
