6. Discussion and conclusion

We have studied the «+ and the x? cases using well-resolved DNS for homogeneous and isotropic
turbulence (HIT) for a variety of conditions (table 1). Our results show that for an unambiguous
power law for energy decay to exist, one needs to start with high enough Reynolds number and
the energy-containing wavenumber is far enough away from dissipation scales, while allowing a
power law at the origin. Only a few cases we examined satisfy these criteria. These cases also obey
the requirement on the skewness of the velocity gradient. We found that when the power-law at
the origin was initiated with a «+-type behaviour, the Kolmogorov decay law with the exponent
close to 10/7 was approximately observed. The «2 turbulence conforms to its own expectations.
At the end of this exercise, it is somewhat disappointing that the results are not more closely
aligned with theoretical arguments. We believe that this is due to the fact that the «* and x?
behaviours at the origin do not persist for long periods of time; at least for the conditions of
