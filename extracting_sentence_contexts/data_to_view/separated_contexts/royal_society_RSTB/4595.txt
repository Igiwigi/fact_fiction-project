It can be said, however, quite
definitely, that the discrepancy between the activities on the isolated plain muscle is
not of such a nature as to offer any explanation of the difference between the effects
on the entire animal, which the anaphylatoxin kills, in some instances, in a dose as

little as 0°5 c.c., while the normal serum produces practically no symptoms in ten

times that dose. The activity of the anaphylatoxin on the plain muscle may be twice
or thrice that of the normal serum ; certainly it is not more. While the action of this preparation on plain muscle is under discussion, we may
recall the fact that FrrepBerGer (32) himself has tested it in this way. He found
that it stopped the activity of an isolated slip of intestinal muscle, and argued, some-
what surprisingly, that this represents the true anaphylactic reaction, while the
contraction of the isolated anaphylactic uterus in response to its antigen has not this
significance, because the muscle is stimulated and not killed. We have failed to
confirm FRrEDBERGER’S observation.
