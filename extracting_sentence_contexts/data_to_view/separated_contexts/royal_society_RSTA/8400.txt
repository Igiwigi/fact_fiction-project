In the present problems, a function f(p), odd for
real values, becomes mixed when to is the variable, and the possibility of an expansion
of its odd portion in Q-functions is not evident without some demonstration, which is
given in due course for the function of our fundamental electrostatic problem. The
demonstration is, of course, to the effect that the odd and even portions separately
give rise to series 1) in Q’s and 2) in P’s whose coefficients differ only by a constant
numerical factor—usually 2/2. This is a severe restriction on the types of function f
which can satisfy the conditions of the problem, though we know, from the fact that
the electrical problems must have solutions, that these functions must exist.

§18. Expansions in Q and q Functions, Argument Less than Unity. We have seen that a real function f(¢) admitting

F(e) = =2 S Mo an (2 )

must also, if positive values of p are contemplated, admit also

f(se) = 5 Aan (—)" {3 Pan(¢) — +Qan(¢
