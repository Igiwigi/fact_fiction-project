promulgating an image of the industry as ethical and trustworthy; and (iii) the revision of existing
academic programmes and creation of new ones to foster belief in the free market principles. The
first goal was intended to prevent the development of municipal electricity programmes in the
present; the second two were intended to ensure the long-term dominance of private electricity
in American life.

(a) Recruiting experts and constructing competing facts

The principal point of factual contention was the cost of electricity generation. However, by
NELA’s admission the goal was not to support objective study of the matter, but to ‘kill’ the
municipal ownership idea. As one document testified: ‘the information we want is information
showing the failure of municipal ownership, its inefficiency compared with private operation and
the fact that municipal ownership, in the last analysis, is more expensive’ [33, p. 237].


There were two aspects to this. The first was the price of private electricity. Under existing
regulatory structures, utilities were entitled to a ‘reasonable’ rate of return. This was generally
thought to lie between 5.5% and 6.5%, but at least one study at the time showed that most
companies were making at least 7%; many were making 8% or even 9%. This meant that
companies were overcharging their customers to the tune of millions or even tens of millions
of dollars per year. The second was the cost of public electricity. Much of this debate surrounded
the Ontario hydropower system, a government-run operation that brought power to residents
across Ontario at lower costs than the privately generated power that US citizens were buying just
across Niagara Falls. NELA responded by recruiting academics to undertake studies purporting
to demonstrate that Ontario hydro was more expensive [33, p. xxiii].
