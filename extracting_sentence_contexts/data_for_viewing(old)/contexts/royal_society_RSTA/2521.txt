% Length of proof is 236.

% Level of proof is 39.

% Maximum clause weight is 49.

The drop in the parameters is not as dramatic as before, but we still have a simpler proof. Note
that the maximum clause weight, which started at 87, did not change in this iteration. We could
continue in the same vein for a while, but what will happen eventually is that the proof lengths
will no longer drop, but might in fact rise a bit. Generally speaking, what tends to happen is that
proof lengths (and the other parameters) rise and fall. A stable proof might be found at some
point or it might not.

Instead, let me introduce another part of this general technique: squeezing the maximum
clause weight. We reduce the allowed maximum clause weight of the search to 48. This means
that any time PROVER9 generates a clause of weight greater than 48, it will be deleted instead of
being put on the SOS. (We also have to set a flag that tells PROVER9 to apply this weight restriction
to hint matchers; by default, it does not do so.) So what we expect to happen here is that the clause
of weight 49 which showed up in the last two proofs will be generated but deleted before it has
a chance to be selected as given. If all goes well, PROVER9 will find a proof that bypasses that
clause. Here is the result.
