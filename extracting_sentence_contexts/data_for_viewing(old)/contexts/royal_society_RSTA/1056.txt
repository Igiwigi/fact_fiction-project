In this process, incident photons with wavevector k, polarization € and energy w x are scattered
to states k’, e’ and wy creating excitations with wavevector Q=k’ — k and energy w = ay — ox.
Eg, Ey and E; are the energies of |g), |) and | f) and I, is the inverse core hole lifetime. Several
important facts follow from a detailed consideration of equation (2.1). Since the X-ray wavelength
(1~10 A) is significantly larger than the extent of an atomic orbital (~0.1 A), D and D* can
often be considered under the dipole approximation. As the dipole transitions depend on €
and ¢’, the X-ray polarization can be exploited to help select the desired excitation [6]. The fact
that two dipole operators are present means that, unlike in infra-red or Raman spectroscopies,
electronic transitions within the same orbital manifold, often called dd-transitions, are allowed. At
an L-edge, |n) contains a strongly spin-orbit coupled 2p core hole, which means that the orbital
angular momentum of the photon can be exchanged with the spin angular momentum in the
valence band in order to create spin-flip excitations, such as magnons [7,8]. This is illustrated
schematically in figure 2 and will be discussed in more detail in §4. One should note that RIXS
is a coherent quantum mechanical process, and since |1) is not observed, the process involves a
superposition of all possible intermediate states distributed throughout the lattice, which is why
the collective, Q-dependent excitations of the material are accessible. This is distinct from X-ray
