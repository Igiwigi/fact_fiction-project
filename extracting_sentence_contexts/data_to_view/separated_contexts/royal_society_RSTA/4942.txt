An alternative and more direct approach to characterize
intermittency is to compare the PDFs of increments at different spatial lags, finding that fatter non-Gaussian tails appear in
the PDFs of the smaller lags. (c) An example from solar wind data, where spatial lag is proportional to time lag. (Adapted from nee)

simply adopt a perspective based on analogy with equation (2.6) and proceed to evaluate higher a
order statistics and their scalings with spatial lag. From this emerges a picture quite reminiscent eral
of hydrodynamics, as illustrated in figure 2. . Despite what might appear to be an encouraging similarity in the scaling of higher order
moments in hydrodynamics and in MHD, there are in fact at least two main impediments to a
direct extension of the KRSH to MHD, and at least one additional major problem in extending it
to kinetic plasma, as follows. First, for both MHD and plasma, there is ambiguity regarding the choice of fluid-scale
variables as there are now at least two vector fields involved. These are the velocity v and
magnetic field b, or equivalently the two Elsasser fields z+ = v + b//4irp and z~ =v — b//4xp,
where p is the mass density. (When the magnetic quantities are expressed in Alfvén speed units,
the Elsasser variables take the form z* =v +b.) Is the local dissipation related to 5v,;?
