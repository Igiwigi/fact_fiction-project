the displacement in addition to those of the first order, and the equilibrium between
two contiguous portions will not depend on continuity of displacement and of surface
traction alone : other quantities also would have to be continuous for which there is
no interpretation in the ordinary analysis of elastic reactions: the elastic stress
would in fact not then be expressible in terms of tractions on interfaces. In such a
case the only procedure that seems open, as the science of mechanics is now con-
stituted, would be to transfer the effects of that part of the elastic energy which
involves higher differential coefticients to the class of intrinsic or non-mechanical
deformations.

45. In this theory of electric polarization the division of the forcive per unit volume
into a molar and a molecular part has been made by means of the ideal volume and
surface densities of Poisson, which are the equivalent as regards outside points of the
actual polarization of the material. This method consists essentially in computing
the foreive by combining opposed poles of neighbouring elements, instead of taking
the single polarized element as the unit ; it shows that these adjacent poles nearly
compensate each other except as regards a simple volume density whose attraction
