discolouring oils, and reducing metallic oxides, s0 it may be supposed to operate
directly upon the air, and to possess the power of decomposing carbonic acid, when
this substance is presented to it within the pores of the vegetable tissue. And, on
the other hand, as light appears to be a specific stimulus to the vital functions of
animals, 80 it may be imagined to act in a similar manner on those of plants, thus
enabling them to secrete from the carbonic acid presented to them the carbon re-
quired for their nutrition.

Another point as yet undecided relates to the extent of the influence it exerts
over the vegetable kingdom ; or, in other words, the degree in which certain pro-
cesses attributed to its presence are capable of counteracting others that are going
on at all times, whether light be absent or not. Thus, although it may be conceded,
as a fact already well established, that plants purify the air in the sunshine, it still
remained to be proved by more decided experiments than had hitherto been insti-
tuted, whether the quantity of oxygen given out by them during the day exceeded
that absorbed during the night; and moreover, supposing this latter question an-
swered in the affirmative, whether the probable excess was likely to be such, as would
