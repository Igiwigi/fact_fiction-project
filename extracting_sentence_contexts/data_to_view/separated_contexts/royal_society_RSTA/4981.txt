The contact between the sphere and the
B2O3 block occurs in frame 3. No cracks appear to form during the loading period, but some
densification takes place, which can be seen at the arrow in frame 3. In fact, within this densified
zone two white arcs appear. A possible cause for the appearance of the arcs may be the refraction
of the transmitted light through the densified zone. Unloading begins between frames 4 and 5
and several radial and lateral cracks form (see frame 5), which continue to grow for another
microsecond after the sphere has left the surface of the glass block (see L in frame 6).
