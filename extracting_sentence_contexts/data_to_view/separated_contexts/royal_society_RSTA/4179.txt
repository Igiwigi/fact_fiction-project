Interestingly, such a strong interaction vanishes at the highest arousal level nee)
(arousal 4), being replaced by a stronger (parasympathetic) HF activity associated with EEG @ :
power increase in left frontal regions and in right parietal regions. Importantly, this patterns of a]
activations seem in line with a classical attentional-bradicardic reaction to hyper-aroused images DN
with negative emotional content [82]. We believe that the vanishing effect hereby observed at high [o
arousing elicitation has to be related to the processing of emotions at a CNS level exclusively. [5
At a ANS level, in fact, through the same experimental protocol, our previous findings confirm ,
arousal-specific patterns of skin conductance [83,84], and HRV and respiratory dynamics [85],
allowing for a four-class discrimination of all of the arousing visual elicitations. Statistically significant differences between sessions of the same type should be linked to
the quantification of the effect of (pleasant/unpleasant) arousing stimuli to subsequent neutral
elicitations and resting-state sessions. Interestingly, while we found no variations in brainâ€”
heart dynamics between resting-state sessions, we found significant differences between neutral
sessions.
