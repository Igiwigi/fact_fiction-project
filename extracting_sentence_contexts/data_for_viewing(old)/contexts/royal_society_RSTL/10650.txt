Angular gyrus extensively injured, and two-thirds of the right occipital lobe destroyed,
he animal enjoyed vision 80 perfect that no defect could be discovered by any tests
Applicable to lower animals, continued most intelligent and vivacious, and exercised a
dominant influence over its companions.

Experiment 1* showed that almost entire removal of one occipital lobe was without
appreciable effect on vision ; and Experiment 2* showed that considerable bilateral
lesions were also negative. This experiment is still more striking,

(and subsequently also the greater portion of the frontal lobes) had been removed, there
was g8ome defect in vision, shown in incorrect appreciation of the distance of objects. In

this case there was considerable hernia cerebri, and the angular gyrus of the right 8ide
was involved in the lesion.

As the brain of this animal had been carefully preserved in spirib since 1875, photo-
