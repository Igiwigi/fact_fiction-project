This was the strongest line in the photograph taken
ey Dr. Hueerns in March, 1882,* but it was not shown in Dr. Draper’s photograph
Baken i in the same year.t
% Dr. Draper says: “I have not found the line at 3730, of which he (Dr. Huaarys)
Speaks, though I have other lines which he does not appear to have photographed. "his may be due to the fact that he had placed his slit on a different region of the
‘nebula, or to his employment of a reflector and Iceland spar prism, or to the use of a
glifferent sensitive preparation. Nevertheless, my reference spectrum extends beyond

he region in question.” = A later photograph (1889), taken by Dr. Huaains,t did not show the line in
Ayuestion, the slit being placed on a different part of the nebula.
