the semidiurnal variation stand out in the same way as it does for the lower layers.
Further, the inequalities of solar radiation in the two hemispheres near solstice ought
to cause an appreciable oscillation dependent on the velocity potentials w’, and y,’.
The barometric variation due to y,’ is unimportant compared with that due to y’,
because although the forced period is 12 hours, the free period corresponding to the
motion involved in it has now a different value; but in the upper layers the relative
importance of yf,” would be increased, or, as it would be more correct to say, the
relative importance of w,” disappears. This would account for the magnitude of the
seasonal term in the magnetic variation.

The suggested partial independence of the oscillations of the upper and lower
atmospheres may also explain the discrepancy of phase, which we found to be 14 hours,
but is in reality somewhat greater, owing to the fact that self-induction has been
neglected in calculating the phase. With the calculated conductivity, self-induction

would cause a retardation of about one hour if the amplitude of oscillation is that
deduced from the barometric variation. If the amplitude in the conducting regions
is greater, the effect of self-induction is correspondingly less, because a smaller
conductivity would then be required to account for the magnetic change.
