inferences from what they say.

23. In the first place they must be very liable to associate, almost indissolubly, the
true normal name of a colour with the sensation it conveys to their minds, whatever that
s8ensation may be; and they may therefore easily be led to speak of that colour as if they
saw it, like other people, although the sensation they refer to may be really of quite a
different nature to that which the name implies. A colour-blind person will be espe-
cially loth to believe that certain colours, which he hears about and talks about every
hour of the day, can be invisible to him. Objects of these hues will probably present
to his mind s80me ideas of colour (though not the true ones), and he may naturally
imagine therefore that he does see them, and may give his description accordingly.

And this source of error is very much enhanced by the fact that it is not an easy
matter always to refer different tones of any one colour to the same colour-sensation ; $0

that a modification of tone, if considerable, may be easily supposed to be a different
colour. The sensations excited by the higher, the middle, and the lower divisions of
any one of the © gammes chromatiques” are s0 different from each other, that it requires
no small degree of reflection and judgment to be able to identify the difference as due
to black or white only, independent of any other colouring agent.

1 believe this difficulty is also felt by the normal-eyed, and the popular nomencla-
ture of colours furnishes illustrations of the fact, different tones of the same colour
having often different names, and being treated as separate colours. Pink and crimson,
lilac and violet, are well-acknowledged examples of this; and a dark shade of orange is
