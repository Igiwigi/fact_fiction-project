The invading roots almost invariably run lengthwise through the petiole. Whether
they grew downwards or upwards, or some in one direction and others in another, is a
question which will be discussed presently. A noteworthy fact about the distribution of
the intruded roots is that they are commonest in the large petioles towards the periphery
of the trunk (see Plate 1), becoming gradually rarer in the thinner petioles towards the
interior. As the large outer petioles are those of the older leaves cut at a higher level, while
the inner petioles are younger but cut nearer the base, where they are thin, one is
inclined to suspect that the roots grew downwards through the leaf-axis. In spite of
the number of petioles examined, intruded roots were invariably absent from the very
base of the leaf, where it is attached to the stem ; nor are such roots found in any of
the stems, although the latter are literally packed among roots.
