This can be due only to the mass being raised to a height Ah above its rest position
MpgAh= Mpgbt0Â® (2.8b)

so that
Ah= Lary (2.8c)

For small angular deflections, Ah can be very small. In the present G experiment, in which the
deflection of the torsion balance during the Cavendish mode is about 150 rad, we find Ah is
only 10 fm (which is roughly the diameter of the nucleus of a copper atom).

It is interesting to note that Heyl & Chrzanowski [16] attempted to exploit the properties of a
bifilar suspension that provides an apparently similar gravitational restoring torque. In fact, there
is a crucial difference. In a wide torsion strip, the strain is distributed uniformly along the length
of the strip, whereas in a bifilar suspension all of the strain occurs at the points of attachment of
the wires where it is impossible to avoid frictional losses.


For a wire suspension, the equivalent expression for restoring torque is
