Electrostatic Attraction between Material Bodies.

44. When two charged bodies are moved relative to each other the total elec
energy of strain in the ether is altered; on the other hand, since the electri
displacement (rotation of the «ther) is circuital, the charges of the bodies
maintained constant. In the absence of viscosity, this loss or gain of energy must
due to transference to some other system linked with the electric system ; it reappe

n fact as mechanical energy of the charged conductors, which determines the
anical forcive between them. — It is desirable to attempt a closer examination of
nature of the action by which this transfer of energy takes place between
wther and the material of the conductors, and by which the similar transfer takes
lace at a transition between one dielectric substance and another.

Tn the displacement of a conductor through an excited dielectric there is thus an
yerflow of electromotive energy, and in the absence of viscous ayencies and radiation
t simply displays itself in ordinary mechanical forces acting on the surface of the
onductor. The magnitude of these forces has been examined experimentally in
ferent media, and has been found to correspond precisely with this account of
gir origin ; good reason can be assigned to show that their intensity changes from
pint to point of the surface according to a law* (KF*/87, where F is electric force)
