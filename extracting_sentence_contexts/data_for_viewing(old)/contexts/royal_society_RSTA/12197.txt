In a steady motion the right-hand side of this equation would vanish; and the
conditions of steady motion are thus determined by the solution of the ordinary
potential equation for a uniaxial medium. The constants involved in the values of
J, g, h so determined are connected by the fact that at a boundary of the elastic
medium the rotation (f, g, 2) must be directed along the normal. It follows at onee
for example that for a spherical nucleus * the rotation is everywhere radial. As the

electrons rotating round each other in equal orbits, their secular effects just cancel each other, so that
the molecule as a whole is non-magnetic. This exact cancelling will not however usually occur when
there are more than two electrons in the molecule, or when a number of molecules are bound together
in a group as in the case of an iron magnet. Similar considerations also apply as regards the ave;
electric moment of a molecule, which is in fact the electric moment of the Gaussian secular equival
above described.
