and thick at the margin. As Brapy points out, the central part of the microspheri
form, composed, as above stated, of small chambers, is not more than one-third
thickness of the primitive dise which occupies the centre of the megalospheric form, 4

As the microspheric form increases in size, it frequently happens that the edge of
the disc becomes double, so that a radial section at right angles to the plane of the
disc is y-shaped (fig. 43). ;

The shells whose margins present this character, and which have only been
obtained. from Fiji and Tonga, have been separated as a distinct variety, named
“laciniata” (Brapy). So far as I have seen they are all microspheric.

I may further recall the fact that the peripheral annuli of the full grown disc of this
form are often found to be not divided up into small cubical or columnar chambers,
as are those lying nearer the centre, but are composed of spacious chambers extending
vertically through the whole thickness of the disc, and circumferentially round a
considerable portion of its circuit. These may be called the brood chambers (fig. 43).
In specimens which Brapy obtained from the reefs of Fiji these chambers contained
multitudes of young shells, consisting of the “ primitive discs” of the megalospherie
form.

T have now to give the results of my examination of preserved specimens.

MicrospHeric Form.—All the examples of this form which I have examined, were
full grown or nearly so. As above stated, the central part of the shell is occupied by
