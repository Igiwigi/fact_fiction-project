L $1, Tyz tendency to apply dynamical principles and methods to explain physical

Conservation of Energy. This discovery called attention to the ready conversion of

at the present time. We may look on the matter (including, if necessary, the ether)
which plays a part in any physical phenomenon as forming a material system and
study the dynamics of this system by means of any of the methods which we apply to
the ordinary systems in the Dynamics of Rigid Bodies. As we do not know much about
