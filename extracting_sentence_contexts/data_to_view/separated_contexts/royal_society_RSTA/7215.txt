Finally, we have a theorem on approximation:
TueoreM D*., If xe R*(a,b), then | bx—a|<1
This may be proved by observing that the worst x in the interval #*(a, /) to approximate

are those at the ends, i.e. the medians. It may then be verified that the medians do in fact
satisfy the required inequality. From Theorem D* we may derive a more general theorem on linear forms:

Tueorem E. Let a, b, c, d be real numbers, ad—be +0.
