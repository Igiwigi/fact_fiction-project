which is, of course, inconsistent with the equation C’ = dD‘/dt.

C.—Preliminary Justification of the Foundations of the Present Theory.

12. I have deliberately led up as quickly as possible to a description of the mathe-
matical machinery to be used subsequently, as it has been necessary to notice
incidentally some of the essential characteristics of the fundamental assumptions and
the methods of investigating their consequences advocated in the present paper. As
a preliminary justification of these assumptions, I cannot do better than indicate the
line of thought which led up to them.

In studying Maxwe u's theory, and seeing how beautifully it was built up step by
step from a mass of experimental facts, till the consistent whole stood revealed, it
seemed to me that, notwithstanding the general harmony of its different parts, there
was just here still something to be desired, some single plan that should govern the
whole. This statement may not seem justifiable, so I instance two examples of the
want of harmony. In one part of his treatise, the kinetic part, he works out the con-
nections between the different parts of his theory by the general methods of
Dynamics. But not so in the statical part. It would seem that the statical part of
the subject, in such a plan as just mentioned, ought to appear as a particular case of
the kinetic, whereas, in MAxwELL’s treatise, the statical terms in the equations are
merely added on to those deduced from dynamical reasoning. The same remark
applies to the terms necessary to produce the mechanical effects of magnetism
