If we take the three smaller
intervals, which may happen to be the day tides, we have, for the mean, 40”; if we
take the three others, we have 180, or three hours. And if we use the common
* establishment,” the confusion is still greater. The fact is, that in snch cases the
term © establishment” loses all definite meaning, as I have already observed*, It
cannot be of use, either in expressing the laws of the tides at any one place, or the
mode of transmission of the tide from one place to another. The former subject, the
law of the diurnal inequality of the tides at a particular place, I have been able to
assign for several places, and in some degree, in general. The latter, the mode in
which the diurnal and the semidiurnal wave are transmitted and continued, is a
more difficult question.
