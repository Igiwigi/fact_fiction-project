First observe that for any C! vector functions x+> v(x) and x+ u(x), one has the formula
(Vx + (u" @ u")) v= Vx (U7 vu) — (UW @u): Vyv. (3.18)
Then use this formula with v = 71 and v = 7, respectively, to obtain:

(\ -((u" ue) = (wu! @ w"): vs) _ {Fete fi?) + ao((u" Fu" z))
Vx + ((u Zu) = (U9 @ ull): Vat + (As(U(U" « Z)(w" -Fi)) + da((u" - 2)2))

For the first term of the right-hand side of (3.19), the divergence formula (2.32) has been used,
while for the second term (2.1), the gradient formula (2.2) has been used. Then once again one
uses the divergence formula (2.3) to conclude the proof. a

Combining the result of the Lemma above with the expression of the Laplacian in geodesic
coordinate (2.3c) to compute Ax((u" (x) - n(x))?) and Ay@y in the right-hand side of (3.15), equation
(3.15) yields the following basic formula for our purpose:

Remark 3.8. It is important to underline the fact that by the specific choice of P”, there are no
terms involving the second-order derivative with respect to s of u” and P” on the right-hand side
of the formula (3.20). The first consequence of formula (3.20), and the aforementioned remark, is the uniform (with
respect to 7 and «) continuity of the function asP}, which is the objective of the following ‘trace’:

Proposition 3.9. The function asP} is given by an equation of the following form:
