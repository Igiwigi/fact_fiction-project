For example, in much of the cooperative
breeding literature higher fertility, and probabilities of pro-
gressing to a next birth, are interpreted as evidence that kin
presence is helpful—presumably because it increases fitness
[57-59]. This inconsistency means the same empirical associ-
ation of kin presence with higher fertility is often interpreted
as evidence of altruism, or of coercion, depending on whether
the family member is a woman's mother [57,59] or mother-
in-law [11,60], respectively. In fact, in most places where
anthropologists have tried to measure the relationship between
fertility and fitness, including in high fertility contexts with
limited effective contraception, these are positively and mono-
tonically related [61-64]. This does not necessarily mean that
one or both arguments must be incorrect: a woman’s costs to
shorter IBIs can be lowered by supportive social relations,
and she can be coerced into a shorter (or longer) IBI by
a mate unsure about his future paternity. However, we
should be devising better predictions for differentiating the
hypothesized mechanisms of influence on reproduction.
