The force of this reasoning is emphasised by the fact that, when the high birth-
rate persists for two months, whites produce the maximum of F, during the first
month, the influence acts quickly ; while in coloured people the impulse is strongest
in the second month, in other words the tendency is cumulative in their case.

12. The Proportion of the Sexes produced by Legitimate and Illegitimate Unions
at Times of Highest and Lowest Fertility as compared with the Average Pro-
portion.â€”There is a consistent difference between the proportion of M. born from
legitimate as compared with illegitimate unions, and the inference has been drawn
that the forces which induce that difference act differently in the two races. This
inference was shown in the last section to be justified for births as a whole, and
here the same fact is again demonstrated. The proportion of M. is higher at times
of lowest fertility than during breeding seasons, but the difference is greater for
coloured than for whites (Table VIII). It is also shown that the higher proportion
of F. produced by illegitimate unions is greatest during breeding seasons for whites
but not greatest during those months, but directly after them, for coloured.

This variation is capable of the same interpretation advanced in the last section.
The forces which act on whites in favour of the production of F. are short-lived,
while for coloured it is cumulative, and the reverse is the case for M.

The phenomena described in the last two sections are instructive. They show an
obvious inclination towards a mean sex ratio and are indicative of a strain. It would
appear that the forces which induce the production of a high proportion of M. or F.
