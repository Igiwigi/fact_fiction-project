We saw previously that Az = projy2(w3(L2))=Span(w2) has dimension 1, that is, w24
0. It follows that c=0, hence v3=v2¢V%. Moreover, the above system gives also
(v3 | W2) = (v2 | w2) =0, that is, v3 is orthogonal to A2. As the dimensions agree, we obtain that
Wo = (Az)+¥" =A}.

Then, note that without loss of generality we can assume that V! = Ap. Indeed, take $2 € U(V?)
mapping V! onto Ao, and set ¢ = (idy1, ¢2, idys) € G(E*). The push-forward @,V° satisfies V5 =v?
and V3 = V°, hence only the one-dimensional ellipsoid E! has been modified. In particular, the
spaces Lx, Ax, A, remain unchanged for k > 2. But, according to the Gelfand—Cetlin diagram, the
eigenvalue of Ey is necessarily 4, hence C’ = ¢,C lies in the same fibre of I, as C.

Figure 3 provides a geometric interpretation of the above two facts. Consider E° a generic
ellipsoid in C3 with semi-principal axes v1,v2,v3 of lengths a1 <az <a3 (with a; =1/,/Aj). If
EF? =F> NV? is a circle of radius az contained in E°, then v2 must be an axis of FE’, giving the
condition W2 = Span(vz) C V?. Moreover, any ellipsoid E! =E° NV! has radius az too, so the
value c = I,(E*) does not depend on the choice of vi.

Finally, if we denote by J; the identity on Az = V; = Span(u1), by J2 the identity on W2 =A, =
L =Span(uz) and by J3 the identity on Lz = Span(u3), we have

— G = {tiJi},

— Gy = U(V?) = U(Cuy @ Cu),
