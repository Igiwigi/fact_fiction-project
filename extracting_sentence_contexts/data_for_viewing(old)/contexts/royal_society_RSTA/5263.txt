the signs of the exponents y and a, the behaviour of the potential is depicted in figure 1. Because : =
this potential W is bounded from below by w(1) = 1/y — 1/a, the energy E[j] always makes sense, : 5

The minimizers of the energy E[j/] are related to stationary states for the aggregation equation DR
pt=V -(pVW x p) studied in [1-5] with repulsive-attractive potentials [6-12]. The set of local : 3
minimizers of the interaction energy, in both the discrete setting of empirical measures (equal- N
mass Dirac deltas) and the continuum setting of general probability measures, can exhibit rich :8
complicated structure as studied numerically in [12,13]. In fact, it is shown in [12] that the : 8
dimensionality of the support of local minimizers of (1.1) depends on the strength of the repulsion 5

at zero of the potential W. For instance, as the repulsion at the origin becomes stronger (i.e. a gets
smaller) in three dimensions, the support of the local minimizer is concentrated on points, curves,
surfaces and eventually some sets of non-zero Lebesgue measure.

From the viewpoint of applications, these models with non-local interactions are ubiquitous
in the literature. Convex attractive potentials appear in granular media [1,2,14,15]. More
sophisticated potentials such as (1.2) are included to take into account short-range repulsion and
long-range attraction in kinematic models of the collective behaviour of animals; see [13,16-19]
and the references therein. The minimization of the interaction energy in the discrete setting is
of paramount importance for the structure of virus capsids [20], for self-assembly materials in
