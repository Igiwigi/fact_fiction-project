Cyclotella cryptica) that can separately perform
photosynthesis and respiration. C. cryptica is able to grow in
the presence of glucose in the dark, but displays lower pro-
ductivity than when operating in the photoautotrophic mode
[8]. In fact, some microalgae are obligate photoautotrophs
because of an inefficient uptake of carbon (reviewed in [9]). In keeping with this observation, it was shown that introduc-
tion of the gene encoding for the human glucose transporter
(GLUT1) in P. tricornutum allowed the uptake of glucose in
the dark, thereby improving biomass production [10]. A
third mode of cultivation is mixotrophy, i.e. the growth in the
presence of both light and organic carbon.
