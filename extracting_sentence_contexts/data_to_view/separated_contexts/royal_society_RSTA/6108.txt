The normalization factor a is
the mean line intercept representing the average grain size. The results are compared with the curves predicted by the classical
SOA theory, with its Rayleigh, stochastic and geometric asymptotes given. (Online version in colour.)

unaddressed so far. Still, the fact of high order scattering diagrams depending on multi-
point correlation functions [19,20] means that approximation exists due to the sole
consideration of the 1 = 2 statistic. It is not yet known how these approximations affect the obtained solution, even for the scalar
case, due to the lack of exact solutions. Therefore, numerical simulations are the only alternative
at this point to evaluate the quality of the obtained solutions.
