carry the analyses ofthe Windermere observations beyond thesimple two-layer hypothesis and
insert a third layer to represent an intermediate metalimnion. Makkaveev (1936) presents
equations applicable to standing waves, neglecting friction, in rectangular basins containing
three or more homogeneous layers of differing density. It is therefore possible, in theory, to
improve the approximation toa natural lake by taking models with as many layers as necessary,
but the complexity of the equations mounts rapidly as each additional layer is introduced.

A summary of the theory of oscillations in a basin with three layers is given as an
appendix to this paper by M. S. Longuet-Higgins, to whom I am considerably indebted
for advice and guidance in the computations which follow. Considering for the moment
uninodal waves only, the equations show that there are three modes of oscillation. One is

associated with the free surface and is in fact the well-known surface seiche; the other two
are internal seiches associated with the two internal interfaces. Displacement at any one
level is due to a combination of all three modes, but maximum displacement due to any
one mode is found at the appropriate interface. In a model which approximates to lake
conditions, the periods of the internal seiches will be very much longer than that of the
surface seiche. In fact, the smaller the density difference across the interface, the longer
will be the period of the mode associated with it. Displacement resulting from the surface
mode (no. 1) is usually small enough to be neglected, and the periods of the internal modes
(nos. 2 and 3) may be derived from equations (A15) and (A16) in the appendix and are

given by T0=2l],/(—gH®), (5)
