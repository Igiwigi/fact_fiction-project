This must also be an
effect of mixing, as past this Station the mean current must flow away from the
trish Sea, i.e. in the direction of increasing salinity. In this instance the water from
the Irish Sea is mixed with the salter water from the Atlantic to the north of Ireland. The fact that the salinity at Stranraer-Larne is under other influence than that coming
from the Irish Sea is shown by the correlation coefficients of table 4. There is only
small correlation with Chicken Rock and Holyhead-Dublin, and no significant correla-
tion with Fishguard-Rosslare. At the four stations between the Mull of Galloway and Skulmartin L.V. the mean
salinities increase steadily towards the west, though the differences are small and the
Skulmartin series is very short.
