The lighthouse
operated for over 90 years until 1931, but the foundation was eventually undermined by scour,
and the structure collapsed in 1932. Since the pioneering work of Mitchell, screw piles have been used for a range of offshore and
onshore structures. Recently, however, they have not seen significant use offshore, and specifically
they have not been used for offshore wind turbines, in spite of the fact that their characteristics
would seem to lend themselves rather well to this application.
