All three exhibit the typical structure of the larger specimens of Astromyelon—a
considerable pith (which has been bored by Stigmarian rootlets, but was probably
y,Solid i in life), a ring of centripetal xylem-groups (10 to 12 in number), and a zone of
8 secondary wood, which is connected with that of the parent axis (see photograph 1),
2 There can be no doubt that the specimen shows the attachment of the roots to a main
axis of some kind. The question to be solved is, whether this main axis was itself a
Sroot orastem. This question appears to be decided by one of the sections (els
81353; see Photograph 2), which distinctly shows thvee of those “lenticular organs,”
‘Bor enlarged medullary rays, which are so characteristic of the stem of Calamites, in
spits infranodal regions, but which, so far as we know, are entirely absent from the
E roots themselves.t At two points, also, the transverse sections of outgoing leaf- —
“cquenaicn can be distinguished. Photograph 2 shows one of the ‘lenticular organs,”
Band one of the leaf-traces, which is especially clear. These facts demonstrate that
‘othe section passes through a node, and therefore that the axis is a stem. This
Sconclusion is further strengthened by the fact that immediately above the node we
‘find the base of a branch fgivohabby abortive) which is thus in the normal position for
&branches of the stem of Calamites.t
% This specimen may therefore safely be regarded as affording additional evidence
that organs with “ Astromyelon” structure, were borne on Calamitean stems.
© The nature of the organs hitherto known under the name of Astromyelon, is now
Es far established that we know them to have been appendages of the stem of
¥ Calamites (Arthropitys of the French authors). Renautr has shown that very
