Classical games (without shared constraints) have unique equilibria under fairly .
mild assumptions. However, in the case of shared constraint games, equilibria are generically
non-unique. In fact, in many cases there is a manifold of equilibria (see examples and a proof
in [21]). It turns out that the non-uniqueness is primarily limited to generalized Nash equilibria and is
not as common with variational equilibria. In particular, one can show the following by applying
standard results on variational inequalities (e.g. [19]) to VI(C, F).
