Therefore, throughout this account, our methods and treatment have been so
arranged as to deal with those plants alone which were sown on the date assigned to
them. At the end of the account we have applied final corrections to allow for the
re-sowing. In point of fact, the result of such corrections is almost negligible,
amounting to an alteration of only a little over one per cent., at the most, in the final
yield of the average plant. Outline of the Evidence Obtained,

It may simplify further discussion if we sketch at this point the general results
obtained, by the aid of fig. 1, which embodies them in graphic form.
