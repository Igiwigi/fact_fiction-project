VNS could be a viable
solution to counteract the sympathetic tone and enhance the vagal tone, with applications for
heart failure, atrial fibrillation and coronary heart disease induced by increased sympathetic
nerve activity [90,91,93]. The improvement in heart failure and the anti-inflammatory and
vasodilatory properties of VNS provide additional antiarrhythmic benefit [94]. VNS, in fact, acts
on proinflammatory cytokines, nitric oxide elaboration and myocardial expression of gap junction
proteins [95,96]. Of note, conventionally, the left-sided cervical vagus nerve is mostly selected as the site
for stimulation because of safety concerns [91,93]. Regarding changes in the ECG morphology,
elevated levels of T-wave alternans were found in patients with drug-refractory partial-
onset seizures following VNS [97].
