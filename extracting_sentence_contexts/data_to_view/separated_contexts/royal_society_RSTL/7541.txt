cerine. "This fact forcibly suggests the experiments of Herr Ma6xvs on the conducti-
vities of the gases, and the extraordinarily great conductivity of hydrogen. As, however,

the conclusions drawn by Herr MaGxus from his experiments have been questioned by
Dr. TyxNpaLL and other physicists, I refrain from doing more than point out this distinct
coincidence.
