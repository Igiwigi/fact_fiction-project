ing, would end by contracting.

If the rod be a ring of large diameter compared with its thickness, the forcive
would be approximately the same, viz, an outward surface force equal to the
difference of the lateral pressures in the rod and air. The result would then be
elongation, with final retraction when the external pressure came to exceed the
internal.

Brpwet1 found a phenomenon of this kind in iron, but it does not seem possible
that the above supposititious case is capable of explaining it, though of course the
true explanation may be in some respects of a similar nature. But the circumstance
are not the same as those supposed. The assumption of a definite connexion between:
H and B, and elastic storage of the energy T, is very inadequate to represent the fact
of magnetisation of iron, save within a small range.

Magneticians usually plot the curve connecting H — hy and B, not between Hand B
or which would be the same, between H — h, and B — B,, where B, is the intrinsie
magnetisation. Now when an iron ring is subjected to a given gaussage (or magneto
motive force), going through a sequence of values, there is no definite curve connecting
H — h, and B, on account of the intrinsic magnetisation. But, with proper allowance
for ho, it might be that the resulting curve connecting H and B in a given specimen,
would be approximately definite, at any rate, far more so than that connecting H — hy
and B. Granting perfect definiteness, however, there is still insufficient information
to make a theory. The energy put into iron is not wholly stored ; that is, in
increasing the coil current we increase B, as well as B, and in doing so dissipate
