Mixed clock appro-
aches could be used in the context of explicit gene-species
reconciliation models [41-43]. In principle, some of the deviations observed here could
be artefacts caused by incorrect fossil calibrations. The fact
that the same branches tend to be affected in the two contexts,
node- and tip-dating, suggests that most of the deviations
detected in the present analysis are not the result of such
mis-specifications of fossil constraints. Still, some of the
deviations observed here are clearly dependent on specific cali-
brations. In particular, a very high rate is detected under the
node-dating approach along the branch leading to Lorisi-
formes (Ofolemur and Nycticebus; electronic supplementary
material, figure S6).
