This is a singular and important fact, and would almost force us to suppose that this
thermal water owes its origin to the neighbouring glaciers.

V. Baths of Nero, near Naples.

A. Geological Position, —The baths of Nero, commonly called Sudatorij di Tritoli,
occur close to the shore of the bay of Baja near Pozzuoli. They consist of yapour
baths cut from the solid tufaceous rock of volcanic formation. Perhaps the most re-
markable fact connected with their geological position, is the proximity of the Monte
Nuovo, elevated by volcanic explosion in 1538, It is singular that the spring imme-
diately to be mentioned should not have been affected by that circumstance ; for
there is every reason to believe that it has flowed since the time of the Romans.

B. Specialties, $c.—I have very fully described the origin and circumstances of
this remarkable spring in my series of papers on the Bay of Naples in the Edinburgh
Journal of Science. I there also quoted the curious mistakes into which trayellers
have been led from the supposed difficulty and danger of reaching the hot spring. I
am led to conclude that the observation I then published is perhaps the only accurate
one which has been made upon this, one of the most curious, and TI believe the hottest
spring on the continent of Europe. It is reached by a low excavated passage, the
latter half of which dips rapidly, and having a sharp turn about the middle of its
