Undoubtedly, to increase the accuracy
of the vessel midline preparation, additional projections are necessary (e.g. [61]). Methodologically, the contribution of side branches of the main coronary arteries to the results
of modelling was not considered in this study. At this stage, we were guided by the fact that the
side arteries were small in diameter (less than 1.5 mm) and could not contribute much to the DB or
LAD hemodynamics. Meanwhile, the contribution of side lateral arteries is certainly an important
issue that needs detailed investigation. Also, as mentioned above, we neglect the influence of
several external processes affecting the flow hemodynamics and model parameters.
