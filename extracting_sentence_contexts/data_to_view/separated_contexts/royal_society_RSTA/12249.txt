When we wish to indicate this fact we may refer to them as intensities. On the
other hand, electric and magnetic induction, and electric currents, belong to the
second class, being defined with reference to areas. When we wish to indicate this
fact we shall refer to them as fluxes.” Now in connecting dashed with undashed
letters it is absolutely necessary to bear in mind whether the vectors indicated are
intensities or fluxes. The connection between D and D’ will differ from that between
H and H’.

7. Nearly all the physical vectors at a point will belong then to one of the
following classes :—

Class I.
