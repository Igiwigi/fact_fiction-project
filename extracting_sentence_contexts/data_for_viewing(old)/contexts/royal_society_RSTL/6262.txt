then, and indeed until the twilight had gone, the forementioned bands, usually 80

prominent, did not appear either black or wide. On October 31, again, the atmo-
spheric lines were not 80 dark as usnal, while the rays beyond C 10 had evidently
suffered a considerable absorption. On neither of these occasions was there much
colour in the sky; but that the phenomena did not depend on either the absence or
presence of humidity in the atmosphere, is evident from the fact that on the earlier date

' there was a keen frost, while on the later day the weather was wet, the thermometer
being 38? F. at the time of observation. That moisture, however, has some influence
in the production of these bands, is shown by the effect of a fog on the solar radiations;
thus on November 20, 1858, at 10 o'clock 4.M., at London, the sun loomed red through
a mist, and a prismatic analysis of its light showed Â« and B with extreme distinctness.

When the sun's rays traverse a mixture of milk and water, though they are dispersed
and absorbed to a large extent, especially at the more refrangible end of the spectrum.
these atmospheric lines are in no way exhibited ; a proof, if additional proof be needed.
that they are not owing to the mere reduction of the light.
