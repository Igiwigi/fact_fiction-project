ritualization, i.e. that the borrowing occurs within the lifetime

of an individual. Given the similarities in form across so
many individuals and dyads, it seems likely that capuchins

as a species (or genus) have evolved a proclivity to prefer

to borrow these particular kinds of behaviours (i.e. elements

from the grooming, extractive foraging and food transfer
repertoires) rather than other behaviour types, owing in

part to the fact that they are descended from a long evolution-

ary line of animals that relies on extractive foraging and social
learning about food that occurs in a scrounging context; this
would be more of a phylogenetic argument.
