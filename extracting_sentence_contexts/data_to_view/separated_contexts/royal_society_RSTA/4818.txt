Sthough sometimes found in a waterworn condition along with these, have usually,
though broken, scarcely suffered from abrasion in any way. From these facts I
Econclude that none of the minerals in the ruby clays of this deposit have been
â€œtransported to any great distance from the source of their origin, and that the
rounding of some is rather to be attributed to attrition in pot holes, on rock surfaces,
Sin the beds of small mountain streams. The fact of the minerals being intimately
FE aaed with the brown clays, shows also that the whole deposit has been moved down
Athe mountain sides without being submitted to forces sufficient to produce a thorough
re-sorting of the component materials. On washing the ruby-bearing materials of this deposit, and eliminating the clay
and fine sand, the remaining portion is found to be made up of quartz, gneiss,
pegmatite, black tourmaline, garnet, rock crystal, spinel, and ruby. In some
Hmyaudwins, notably No. 1 and No. 2, a few sapphires have been found, but
very sparingly.
