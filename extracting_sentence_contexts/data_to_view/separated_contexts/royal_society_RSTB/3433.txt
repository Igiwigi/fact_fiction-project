(1) Collection of Material. Tue records of Australian biology bear sufficient witness to the fact that it is
extremely difficult, even for residents in Australia, to procure the material necessary
for an investigation into the development of the egg of Ornithorhynchus. It is only
through the organisation of special expeditions, with ample resources both of time
and money, that any large measure of success in this direction can be hoped for. The animal itself, though pretty widely distributed, and probably still far from
becoming extinct, is to be found, in any one locality, only in comparatively small
numbers.
