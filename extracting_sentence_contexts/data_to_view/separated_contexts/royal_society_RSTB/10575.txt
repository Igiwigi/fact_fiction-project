Taking as our starting point the
http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2016.0244 fact that every hypothesis has sound empirical evidence to support it, we
argue that the hypotheses are best interpreted in terms of a framework of
evolutionary causes (selection factors), consequences (evolutionary windows
of opportunity) and constraints (usually physiological limitations requiring
resolution if large brains are to evolve). Explanations for brain evolution

‘Physiological determinants of social behaviour seen against the backdrop of the challenges involved with the evolution

substrates that underpin this. A crucial, but frequently overlooked, issue is
Subject Areas: that fact that the evolution of large brains required energetic, physiological
behaviour, evolution, neuroscience and time budget constraints to be overcome. In some cases, this was reflected
in the evolution of ‘smart foraging’ and technical intelligence, but in many
cases required the evolution of behavioural competences (such as coalition
