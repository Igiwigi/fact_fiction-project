( In the preceding account I have used the term * permanent‚Äù for those teeth which

remain in use throughout the animal's life, or, if they fall out (as with the rudimentary
p canines and the premolars of the Macropodide), do not give place to 8uccessional teeth,

| odont mammals is represented in the Marsupials only by the deciduous molars.

It maybe held, on the other hand, that the large majority of the teeth of the Marsu-
pials are the homologues of the milk- or first teeth of the diphyodonts, and that it is the
permanent or second dentition which is 80 feebly represented by the four 8uccessional
teeth. This view is supported by many general analogies in animal organization and
Yevelopment, such as the fact that the permanent state of organs of lower animals often
Dppresents the foetal or transitional condition of the same parts in beings of higher

= Looking only to the period of development of the different teeth in 8ome of the mar-
upial genera, we might certainly be disposed to place the successional premolar in a

Hith the row of teeth among which it ultimately takes its place, the reverse being
