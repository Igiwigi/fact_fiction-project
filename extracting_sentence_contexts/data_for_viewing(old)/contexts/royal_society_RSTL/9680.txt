and logarithmic function of the y's, which are themselves connected by 0 relations, and
the //s are any numbers whatever.

If we express 0 of these variables as functions of the rest and call them 2's, putting
n for m—0O, we can write

hom) +hþ(1)+ - - - +hh lg =wth$ (4) + : tho o(2):

Or making, as we may, the ks each=unity we have shown how to find the
expression required,*

* The 8ubscript letters attached here, and not before, to the functional symbols introduce no novelty.
They are only intended to suggest the fact that what we have written y-(z1), y-(#g) . - - are really y-(z1, 91),
V(g, vg), - - +; While yy and yy . . . are not necessarily the 8ame functions of a1, ay . . This has not
been hitherto overlooked, it is only more clearly put in evidence now.



744 MR. R. C. ROWE ON ABEL'S THEOREM.

23. We may conveniently investigate at this point, as a corollary to previous work,
the conditions necessary that the *algebraic and logarithmic function” often referred to
already should become a constant ; in other words, that the term involving © in the
expression of ABrr's theorem should disappear, and with it the arbitrary quantities
