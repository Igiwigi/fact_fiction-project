paragraphs. The mode of growth, and the root-development, of most of them are,
speaking generally, much more like those of bhe leguminous plants than those of the
grasses, That their greater or less relative prevalence is very much an affair of season,
encouraging or discouraging, as the case may be, the growth of their competitors, the
grasses, is ,Shown in the subsequent sections relating to the several plants and plots.
Again, though present conditions avail much in regulating the distribution and com-
parative prevalence of various groups of plants, it is now well recognised that causes
anterior to the existing order of things have determined the existence of larger or
smaller number of the species of each particular family.

The alleged antagonisms between plants. —DUrEAU DE LAMALLE* was one of the
first to call attention to the apparent antagonism of certain plants, and to their alter-
nate predominance, the one over the other—a fact frequently observed in the case of
forests, He pointed out that grasses were in his experience the most powerful
enemies of Saintfoin and of Lucerne ; that they overcome them when growing together,
without however being able to destroy them utterly. Moreover, he remarked that
in some islated plateaux never manured or irrigated, he saw, five or six times in the
course of 30 years, grasses and Leguminose lose and regain the prominence one over
the other. Similar phenomena have been observed at Rothamsted, as will be illus-
trated in the sequel.

When, however, as at Rothamsted, investigation is pushed farther, and when parti-
cular species of grasses, or of Leguminosz, &c., are examined as to their behaviour
