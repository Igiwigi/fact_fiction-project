Ge integrals of (I.), and by using them and finding 7 — r other integrals, each con-
ining an arbitrary constant, we have a singular solution of the 7 system.

‘5 § 16. Thus, as in the simpler case when there is a single equation of the first order,
e existence of singular solutions appears to be the rule if we consider the integrals,
e exception if we consider the differential equations, and in fact the number of

tonditions for the absence of the first 7 singular solutions rises with r from the first

ton of view, while the generality of the conditions for the existence of the (7 + 1)™

Pesents itself as an alternative to a differential equation, In such a case the integral equation will, of
mrse, relate to the second singular solution, for it contains no arbitrary constant.

Considered geometrically, the second singular solution thus arising will be enveloped by the complete
