The new oxide forms several other double compounds ; but as their analysis would
have scarcely given additional elucidation to the subject, I have omitted to study
them in detail.

The action of various chemical agents upon the compounds of tetrethylammonium
gives rise to a series of yery remarkable substances. Chlorine, bromine and iodine,
convert the base into substitution-products, in which the basic character of the ori-
ginal atom has disappeared ; of these the bromine-compound is distinguished by its
splendid appearance, crystallizing as it does from alcohol in long magnificent orange-
yellow needles. The iodine-compound, too, is very beautiful ; it forms either on addi-
tion of iodine-s0Jution to the base, or on evaporating a solution of the iodide exposed
to the action of the air. In fact it is difficult to avoid the formation of this substance
in recrystallizing iodide of tetrethylammonium. Cyanic acid yields with the base a
crystalline compound, a sort of urea, which is remarkable for its composition, inas-
much as it may be viewed as ordinary urea, in which the four equivalents of hydrogen
are replaced by ethyl. I hope to communicate shortly a full account of these several
substances.

The preceding sketch, incomplete as it is, sufficiently exhibits the leading features
of the new class of snbstances, of which tetrethylammonium and its compounds are
the prototypes. It is at once evident that there is a marked difference between these
latter and the bases which I have described in my former memoir, Irrespectively of
the non-volatility of the new basic oxide, which forms in itself a line of demarcation,
there are many other properties not less distinctive which attract our attention. The
