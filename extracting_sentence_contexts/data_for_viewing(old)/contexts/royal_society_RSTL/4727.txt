the shell.

It will appear that the general equation between the rupturing and cohesive forces
upon which the, position of the parallel of mean pressure depends, can, when the
influence of temperature is abstracted, be made to contain but two independent
variables 0, and a, or that it will be of the form F(9,, a,)=0. 'The value required of
0, must evidently be a maximum, and hence we must determine it in general by eli-
mination between the equations

dF , dF dd, dF
F(0,, ai), iT @,=0 or =;

the fact of the resulting value being a maximum or minimum can be determined as
usual by the sign of I

19. Let two infinite planes be conceived to pass through the axis of rotation of the
hell, making s0 small an angle with each other that the curvature of the arc of the
equator intercepted between them could be considered as insensible. The ratio of
the rupturing to the cohesive forces in either of the opposite portions of the shell thus
intercepted, will be the same as for the whole shell under our assumed conditions.
The conditions for finding the section of rupture of one of these bands will therefore
be the same as those for the entire shell.

Let dL represent an element of the area of the section of rupture, [ its perpen-
