Zthe planes of y5, y3z, 3u/5 determine three other triangles having similar properties.
ZAnd the theorem is that, if the foregoing relation be satisfied for any two of the tri-
angles, it will be satisfied for the other two.

apparently be 1; but this number doubtless admits of some reduction in consequence of
the particular form of the equations. In fact, if a,b .. be the coefficients of the highest
powers of ,, y,, . . in the equation 3"=0, then the terms involving @, 3, .. in (18) all
vanish. But I have not as yet fully investigated this question.
