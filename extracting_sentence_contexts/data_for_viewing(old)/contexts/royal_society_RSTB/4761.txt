two layers of the plate; it represents the double cone, antero-posteriorly compressed ; ¢, calcified
ring, the last remnant of the double cone (see also fig. 5, B, e); f, watery jelly, the remains of the
notochord,

The arch-cartilages have calcified tesserse, and the fact that these are better
developed in the caudal than in the trunk region is a further argument in support of
the view that the trunk vertebre are in a degraded, and not in a primitive condition.
At the sides of the caudal vertebree, on a horizontal level with the middle of the
centrum, are calcified tracts that lie just external to the membrana elastica externa
(fig. 5, A, p’). These lateral tracts I reyard as having been produced by the
activity of the superficial perichondrium, and not by a fusion of neural and haemal
arch-cartilages ; they are, in fact, intermedialia, but, instead of being bulky wedges
as in the Carchariidse, they are reduced to the form of thin plates, K6uLrkxER’s

but fig. 6, 1, of the present paper represents a vertical section, and so the plates are
not seen.
