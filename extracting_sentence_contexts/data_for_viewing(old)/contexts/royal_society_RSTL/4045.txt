substances, which were found slightly magnetic, will illustrate this point :â€”Paper,
sealing-wax, china ink, Berlin porcelain, silkworm-gut, asbestos, fluor-spar, red lead,
vermilion, peroxide of lead, suIphate of zinc, tourmaline, plumbago, shell-lac,
charcoal. In some of these cases the magnetism was generally diffused through the
body, in other cases it was limited to a particular part.

2286. Having arrived at this point, I may observe, that we can now have no diffi-
culty in admitting that the phenomena abundantly establish the existence of a
magnetic property in matter, new to our knowledge. Not the least interesting of
the consequences that flow from it, is the manner in which it disposes of the assertion
which has sometimes been made, that all bodies are magnetic. Those who hold
this view, mean that all bodies are magnetic as iron is, and say that they point be-
tween the poles. The new facts give not a mere negative to this statement, but
something beyond, namely, an affirmative as to the existence of forces in all ordinary
bodies, directly the opposite of those existing in magnetic bodies, for whereas those
practically produce attraction, these produce repulsion ; those set a body in the axial
direction, but these make it take up an equatorial position : and the facts with regard
to bodies generally, are exactly the reverse of those which the view quoted indicates.

@ iv. Action of magnets on metals generally.

2287. The metals, as a class, stand amongst bodies having a high and distinct
interest in relation both to magnetic and electric forces, and might at first well
be expected to present some peculiar phenomena, in relation to the striking property
found to be possessed in common by 80 large a number of substances, 80 varied in
