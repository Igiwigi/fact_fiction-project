change.

With the third part of B and the whole of C the case is very different. The forces
which cause these parts cease to act in the same direction as at first. If the vessel is
allowed to swing at her anchors, or is under sail or steam, she will probably on an
average be nearly as much on one point as on another ; or, which would come to nearly
the same thing, if she is lying in a tideway she may be alternately for six hours in one
direction and for six hours in the opposite direction. A great portion of the C and of
that part of the B which arose from horizontal force thus become dispelled.

The symmetry which gives C its character ceases the moment the ship heels. An
addition is then made to C proportional to the angle of heel, and this addition consists
in fact of two parts, corresponding to the two parts of B which, as we have seen, do not
exist, in the original C, viz. a part consisting of transient magnetism induced by the
vertical force, and a part consisting of subpermanent magnetism induced by the same
force. These will be more conyeniently considered when we come to discuss the heel-
ing error,

'The semicircular deviation may be put under the form 4/B*+C*sin (£'+e), in which
VS B*+C represents the maximum of semicircular deviation, « (tana= 8) the angle to
the right of the ship's head of the force causing this deviation ; for convenience, these

two quantities are tabulated in the eleventh and thirteenth columns.

"The terms D sin 25'+E cos 2! make up what*is called the © quadrantal deviation.”
