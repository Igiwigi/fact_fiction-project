I have thus, as far as T am able, explained the special formations in the brain of the
Mormyrus ; but while it is comparatively easy to account morphologically for these
peculiarities, it becomes very much more difficult, if nob impossible, with our present
amount of knowledge, to account for them physiologically. What can possibly be the
function of this enormonsly developed organ and of the innumerable repetitions of the
game structure? As far as I could learn there was nothing extraordinary about the
habits of these Fishes that could throw any light on it. Tt is true that their eyes are
very small, while their organs of hearing are comparatively highly developed, as was
shown by FiscneR,* but there does not seem to be any connexion between these two
series of facts. Other Fishes have complicated organs of hearing, and, as far as T know,
neither these nor the blind or semi-blind Fishes inhabiting caves have any such pecu-
liarity in the structure of their brain. But the most curious fact about these Fishes is,
that notwithstanding the enormous development of the brain, the nerves emerging
therefrom have nothing like a corresponding amount of development ; most of them
are quite small, some escape detection, and the only nerves of any size, the trifacial
and the vagus, do not present anything out of the common, either in extent or dis-

, which by some writers have been looked upon as electric lobes, and which, although
