is a second-order differential operator representing the enhanced dissipation due to eddy
diffusion. Both operators A, Ag generate strongly continuous semigroups, which we denote by
el, e!Ae (recall that (e'4);~9 is a family of bounded linear maps in L?(D) such that e+9)4 = e!4e4,
e is the identity operator and (d/df)e!4h = Ae'h for every h € D(A); similarly for e!42); these
semigroups are moreover analytic (see [16, §2.5]), but strictly speaking we do not need such fact.
The generation of these semigroups is proved in [16, §7.2]. We use the semigroups to rewrite the
stochastic equation in the so-called mild form, essential for the proof of our main theorem. The
function To(t, x) = (e'40T)(x) solves the modified heat equation

aT Q(t, x) = div[(kl + ZAx, x) VTQ(t,x)], (1.4)

and thus, in view of the following result, we may call Q(x,x) the eddy diffusion coefficient.
We have denoted above by «Ap the first eigenvalue of —A; denote by 4px,q the first eigenvalue
of —Ag; a priori we only know that Apx,Q > KAb.-

Remark 1.1. Cg is a degenerate elliptic operator: since uj|ap =0 we have also Qlap =0.
Therefore, it is not clear a priori that Ag is more ‘elliptic’ than A. However, we shall prove that
