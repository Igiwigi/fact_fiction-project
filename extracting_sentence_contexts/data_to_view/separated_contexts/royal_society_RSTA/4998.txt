However, the analogy is
limited, because the crystallography of fatigue cracks requires that, in many cases, the crack front
must be fragmented into adjacent parallel segments at the crossing of GBs, as shown later. This
fragmentation phenomenon is even more important for cleavage fracture in body-centred cubic
(BCC) metals. This is largely due to the fact that in BCC materials the number of cleavage planes
is lower than the number of possible slip planes. This produces severe constraints for the crossing
of GBs by cleavage cracks and, in particular, the geometry requires that, during this crossing
process, some part of the fracture surface is intergranular. This interaction between trans- and
intergranular fracture has strong implications on the fracture toughness resistance of ferritic steels
when tested in the lower toughness regime or in the ductile-to-brittle transition (DBT) region, as
shown in the second part of this presentation.
