- In fig. 37 the continuous curve is constructed from these observations,* and the
dotted curve B is that derived from curve A, supposing that each ray had an original
luminosity of one amyl light at the distance of 1 foot.

It will be seen that the colour of the central portion of the spectrum is discernible
with much greater reduction of light than is that of the extremities. This accounts
for the fact that objects illuminated by moonlight appear of a greenish hue. The
light from the full moon, as is well known, is somewhere about half a million times
less bright than that of the sun, or about y}5 of an amyl lamp at 1 foot. The figure

when re-combined will be pale green, mixed, of course, with a fair proportion of
