The specimen taken from the bar used to obtain curves A of Diagram 5, that is,
the specimen of Lowmoor iron which had been annealed by heating to 750° C. for
only a few minutes, showed granules larger than in the virgin material, but, taking
the average, distinctly smaller than those shown with the material which had been
subjected to prolonged annealing. This is, of course, in accordance with ARNOLD’Ss
and Sreap’s results. It should be remembered, however, that the structures of
annealed specimens in particular were found to be by no means uniform, so that a
complete survey of the sections had to be made in order to get a just comparison of
the different granular structures.

To return to the elastic properties of the Lowmoor iron, attention may be called to
the fact that the permanent sets which occurred at the various yield-points are
marked in both series of curves in Diagram 5, and also at the yield-points in
Diagram 4. The total elongation of the specimen of Diagram 4, owing to the
position of the fracture, could not be exactly measured, but it was probably about
12 per cent. on a 4-inch length. The breaking load was 314 tons per sq. inch.

* This change in structure produced by annealing has been shown by ARNOLD, “On the Influence of
Carbon on Iron,” ‘ Proc. Inst. C.E.,’ 1895 ; and by Strap, “ The Crystalline Structure of Iron and Steel,”
‘Journ, Iron and Steel Inst.,’ 1898.
