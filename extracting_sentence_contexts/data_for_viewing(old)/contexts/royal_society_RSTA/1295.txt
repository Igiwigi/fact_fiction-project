literature to study the price formation process on intraday electricity markets. Hence, our dataset
allows for a more realistic model specification than proposed in previous research.

Second, we suggest the first econometric price model for 15-min contracts that incorporates
the slope of the merit order curve. This is a substantial improvement over [2] as electricity prices
react asymmetrically to renewable forecast changes depending on the merit-order-curve slope: if
the merit order is steep, electricity prices change more severely in the wake of renewable forecast
errors than if the merit order is flat. Moreover, our econometric model solely involves ex-ante
market knowledge.

Third, and to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work studying the influence of
neighbouring 15-min contracts on the price dynamics of a given contract. This is motivated by
the fact that adjacent contracts are driven by similar market information.

This paper is organized as follows: in ยง2, we lay out our dataset and perform an empirical
analysis of intraday transaction data of 15-min contracts. In ยง3, we present our econometric model


as well as the threshold regression. In ยง4, we calibrate our econometric model to market data and
discuss the estimation results. We offer our conclusions in ยง5.

2. Stylized facts

In this section, we lay out our dataset and empirically analyse transaction prices and trading
volumes of 15-min contracts.
