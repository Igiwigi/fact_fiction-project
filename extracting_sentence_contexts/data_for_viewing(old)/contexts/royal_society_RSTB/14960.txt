text segments in which Moynihan was provided as the
basis for the identification of nuclear species; in all these cases,
the information contained in the segments was insufficient
to evaluate appropriateness. We assigned the remaining
136 segments to three categories based on appropriateness:
1. Supports: Moynihan contains all the information attributed
to it; 2. Partially supports: Moynihan contains part of the infor-
mation attributed to it, or information attributed to Moynihan
is incomplete; 3. Does not support: Moynihan does not contain
any of the attributed information (electronic supplementary
material, table $3).

In the case of ‘fact about nature’ type of citations, assessing
the appropriateness of citations was complicated. On one hand,
given that Moynihan’s study was restricted to Panama, all ‘fact
about nature’ statements (43/149 statements; 29%) that reference
Moynihan in a universal fashion are, de facto, inaccurate. Never-
theless, we assessed citations of this type separately, in two
regards: 1. Does Moynihan provide any empirical evidence,
even if not universally true, that fits the attribution? 2. Does Moy-
nihan contain any ideas/hypotheses that fit the attribution? In
each of these cases, we classified the support that Moynihan pro-
vides using the same three-point scale used above, i.e. supports,
partially supports and does not support.
