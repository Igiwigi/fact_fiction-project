buffers of different pH. All ion content values are given as a percentage of the starting concentration, which was measured after 1 h incubation in 0.7% nitric acid

(1901 + 132 ppm calcium, 593 + 88 ppm magnesium).

pH values (figure 6c,d; ANOVA, p = 0.75 for calcium, p = 0.60
for magnesium), and the average amount of calcium or
magnesium removed in 1 h across all pH values was 96% +
6.5 for calcium, and 101% + 5.9 for magnesium. To investigate
this further, the amount of metal ions removed was measured
over shorter time increments. The time course was the same
at pH 2.9 and 7.4 (figure 6b; electronic supplementary
material, figure 2). In fact, at both extremes of pH tested,
more than half of the magnesium diffused out of the glue
in merely 5 min, and roughly 20 min for calcium.
