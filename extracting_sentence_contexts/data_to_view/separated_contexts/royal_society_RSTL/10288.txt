The number of plots on which ib contributed 5 per cent. and upwards of the
produce was 14 in 1862, only eight in 1867, and was reduced to three in 1872, and to
two in 1877. The plots on which it maintained this degree of prominence were all
nitrate plots. Tn fact, although at first extremely prominent on many plots it
strikingly declined wherever ammonia was applied, and almosb as strikingly retained
its position on the plot with the mineral manure and the larger amount of nitrate of
soda (14); yielding on it 22:48 per cent. of the total produce in 1862, 32*93 in 1867,
2476 in 1872, and 21:59, in 1877; whilst in 1874 it was estimated to form about
one-half of the total herbage of the plot. ON THE MIXED HERBAGE OF PERMANENT MEADOW. 1241

] This grass, in addition to its tufted stems, has numerous underground stolons, which

underground stems as well as from the stolons, are fibrous, intricately branched, not
penetrating very deeply, but forming a dense mab beneath the surface.
