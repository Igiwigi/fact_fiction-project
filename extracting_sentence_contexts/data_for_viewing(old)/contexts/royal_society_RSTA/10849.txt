to modify in any way the course of this current, but at Chateaubelair there are several
well-marked ridges between the village and Wallibu, and these certainly directed and
deflected the path of the blast. At the north side of Richmond Vale Estate there is a
spur, some 500 or 600 feet high, running down to the sea, and on the side of this ridge
next the crater the destruction of vegetation has been very great; on the south side,
a week or two after the eruption, everything was as green as before. It is in every
way probable that these ridges saved the village, and a careful examination of the
difference in the appearances presented by the country to the north and to the south
side of each of them convinced us that they had intercepted the violence of the blast,
and protected the region behind them. The moving mass of sand and gases was too
heavy to rise freely in the air when it passed over Richmond, but clung to the surface
of the ground, and lost much of its energy and dropped most of its solid matter before
it could surmount an obstruction. The blast was, in fact, only the lighter and upper
portion of the avalanche of dust.

The rampart of the Somma wall, which faces the crater on its northern side,
undoubtedly protected the country behind it, for the denser portion of the cloud was
too much loaded with dust to climb this ridge. Its main force poured over the lower
south lip of the crater with the avalanche of sand. On the north side the deposits
are comparatively thin, and it seems that most of the material that emerged from the
crater was deflected by the Somma and lodged in the valley of the Larikai, A
black cloud certainly descended on Grand Baleine, but in surmounting the intervening
summit ridge of the hill it had lost by far the greater part of its burden of ash and
therewith most of its violence.
