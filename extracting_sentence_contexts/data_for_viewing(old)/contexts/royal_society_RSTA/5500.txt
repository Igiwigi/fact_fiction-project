For this purpose, a data/information infrastructure has to be implemented. It allows all
technological equipment to be connected and interoperate. In this project, this infrastructure is
provided by the Industrial Internet-of-Things (IloT) platform Winnum [38].

As a matter of fact, this platform allows counting on monitoring data that is located in the
cyber space and is associated with specific models of equipment, processes and production plans
(schedules), which together serve as a basis for the digital twin of the described production
system. The IIoT platform allows the integration of third-party equipment, e.g. working with
CNC equipment provided by other manufacturers, given that this equipment has the adequate
process interface, special connectors that work e.g. with their web-interfaces.

A physical object to be manufactured in the cyber-physical platform is called here ‘smart
product/smart workpiece’. As a matter of fact, the smartness of the product consists in this
research project of the capability of the physical object to provide the operator of equipment,
the production supervisors, the maintenance technicians, the production managers, and all
components of the platform (on all three levels) with real-time (current) data and information
necessary for performing decision-making processes and their functionality, at the corresponding
phase of the product, production system and production process life cycles.

Such an object is first identified at the entry point into the ICPS. As a part of this operation,
the object receives a tag through which it acquires a digital identity. The tag contains a link to the
cyber space, where the data on a current state of the physical object (such as identification data,
location data, object statuses and state attributes) is stored and ready to be transmitted.

The HoT allows the digital identification and tracking of different types of physical
