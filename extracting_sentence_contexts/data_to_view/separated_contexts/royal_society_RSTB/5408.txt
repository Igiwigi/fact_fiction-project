There is a peculiarity in this case that the Ist arch of
the urostyle has a pair of transverse processes. RipEwoop (1896) is mistaken when
he says that in Xenopus the 2nd, 3rd and 4th vertebree have no diapophyses. As
a matter of fact, there are small diapophyses quite distinct from the ribs, and
even the suture for the articulation could be easily detected. Ripewoop could
not detect this simply because he did not cut sections but only had whole mounts
of the larval stages, and he himself has admitted that his enquiry makes no pretence
to completeness. Tn our paper on Urodela (1930) we stated that in this group the rib is formed as an
aggregation of cells in the septum dividing two myotomes, and subsequently grows
inwards, and joins a rib-bearer (diapophysis) developed from the side of the neural
arches.
