I shall now add a few remarks on the subject of the rota-
tion of the fixed stars on their axes. This motion has been
lately mentioned in a paper, where I could not have an oppor-
tunity to enter into the reasons why it ought to be admitted.*
The discovery of the period of « Herculis furnishes me with
an opportunity to say a ſew words upon the subject, as every
addition to the list of periodical stars increases our knowledge
of the construction of the celestial bodies. Not s0 much be-
cause now one $tar more is known to be subject to periodical
changes in its lustre; for this would indeed be of no great con-
sequence. But we ought not to be satisfied with merely in-
rolling this circumstance among the list of facts we are ac-
quainted with. The rotatory motion of stars upon their axes
is a capital feature in their resemblance to the sun. It appears
to me now, that we cannot refuse to admit such a motion, and
that indeed it may be as evidently proved as the diurnal mo-
tion of the earth.

Dark spots, or large portions of the surface, less luminous
than the rest, turned alternately in certain directions, either
towards or from us, will account for all the phenomena of
periodical changes in the lustre of the stars, so satisfactorily,
that we certainly need not look out for any other cause, Let
us, however, take a review of any objections that might be
