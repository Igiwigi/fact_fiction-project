Even in the case of the structures from
Iowa, where Goniatite nodules have not been recorded, Mr. GresLEy informs us that
he found many marine shells and Hnerinites close down upon the coal. ORIGIN OF THE CALCAREOUS CONCRETIONS KNOWN AS “COAL BALLS.” 195

Tn fact, we might almost use Brnnry’s words (’68, p. 14) and say: “So far as my
experience extends, the occurrence of nodules in the coal is always associated with
that of fossil shells in the roof.”

A case which is of considerable importance in this connection is that described on
p. 188, figs. 4and 5. Here we see, even more clearly than usual, the connection that
exists between the marine conditions succeeding the deposition of the coal (as
evidenced by the marine shells in the roof) and the formation of the calcareous
concretions containing plants in the seam. Here, in the Gannister Seam, which is
otherwise without “coal balls” in its coal or marine shells in its roof, we see the coal
balls appearing in a perfectly typical form, directly the Gannister comes near enough
to the Upper Foot Mine to be within the sphere of influence of the marine conditions
which prevailed while its roof was deposited.
