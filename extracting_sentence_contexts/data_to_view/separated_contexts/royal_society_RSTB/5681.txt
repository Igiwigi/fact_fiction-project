38 M. SNOW AND R. SNOW: EXPERIMENTS ON PHYLLOTAXIS.

at least one group of facts of which Van Irerson has not been able to offer any con-
vineing explanation (1907, p. 247 seq). But since it is intended presently to report
further experiments on phyllotaxis, discussion of these questions will be postponed. Here, however, it will just be pointed out that Van Irersonâ€™s theory suffices to
render intelligible the origin of Fibonacci phyllotaxis systems in seedlings.
