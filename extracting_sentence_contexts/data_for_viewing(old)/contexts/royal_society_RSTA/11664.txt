Repeated efforts were made to determine the F.P. of mixtures containing more
than 85 atomic percentages of lead, but the only stop in the cooling takes place at
327°°5, the F.P. of pure lead, or more strictly the F.P. of a eutectic mixture of
copper and lead. It will be seen that, at 60 atomic percentages of lead, the eutectic
point was 327°. In this series of experiments we did not attempt to make a minute
study of the eutectic alloy of copper and lead; but on a previous occasion, using a
sensitive mercury thermometer (‘Chem. Soc. Journ.,’ 1892, p. 906), we found that
copper lowered the F.P. of lead by 1°'17 C., and that the eutectic alloy contained
rather less than ‘2 atomic percentage of copper.

The difficulty of tracing the upper branch of the curve between 85 and 100 atomic
percentages of lead is not due to the insolubility of copper in lead, for, at a red heat,
copper dissolves freely ; but rather to the fact that, between these limits, the solu-
bility changes but little with change of temperature, so that at any given temperature
the amount of solid that separates is small. It is evident that the curve must
become almost vertical for dilute solutions.

At the end of each series, after removing the pyrometer and stirrer, the furnace
was closed as completely as possible, and the alloy allowed to cool slowly in a current
of reducing gas. When cold. the alloys were weighed. They were in the form of
cylinders, 3 centims. wide and from 4 to 7 centims. long. Each ingot was completely
covered with a thin layer of soft metal, which appeared to be almost pure lead, but,
on cutting a plane face from end to end along the cylinder, the character of the alloy
could be studied.
