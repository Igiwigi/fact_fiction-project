that “It is hardly necessary to state again that the fused sporangia of Marattia are
a sorus, and not, as they had sometimes been held to be, a plurilocular sporangium ;
this follows from the fact that each sporangium, as in Angiopteris, has its own
special archesporium.” We shall naturally accept the position that what is usuaily styled the sorus in
Marattia is a true sorus, comparable with that of Angiopteris, and of various other
ferns ; but the further point included in the above quotation from GorpEL does not
necessarily follow. Even if the fact were always as he states, that each sporangium
has its own special archesporium, this does not by any means prove that it was
separate by descent from its neighbours.
