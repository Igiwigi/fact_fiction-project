Tur various experiments which have hitherto been made
with a view to determine the question s0 long agitated, re-
lative to the weight which has been supposed to be gained, or
to be lost, by bodies upon their being heated, are of a nature
80 very delicate, and are liable to 80 many errors, not only on
account of the imperfections of the instruments made use of,
but also, of those, much more difficult to appreciate, arising from
the vertical currents in the atmosphere, caused by the hot or
the cold body which is placed in the balance, that it is not at
all surprising that opinions have been so much divided, relative
to a fact s0 very difficult to ascertain.

It is a considerable time since I first began to meditate on
this subject, and I have made many experiments with a view to
its investigation ; and in these experiments, I have taken all
those precautions to avoid errors, which a knowledge of the
various sources of them, and an earnest desire to determine a
fact which I conceived to be of importance to be known, could
inspire ; but, though all my researches tended to convince me
more and more, that a body acquires no additional weight upon
being heated, or rather, that heat has no effect whatever upon
the weights of bodies, I have been s0 sensible of the delicacy of
