QUOTIENTS APPERTAINING TO /THE EXPANSION OF E, 469

Art. (e.) Let D,,,,;..,, be used in general to denote the determinant

then the simplified ith Sturmian residue R; may be expressed under the form
Ds $VY an —D., 3, con f+1 a2 +D, 44. « (i+9) PI REDS n=i=1,...n7

which is easily identifiable with the known expression for such residue. Now obviously the necessary and sufficient conditions in order that the » roots
may consist of only repetitions of 4 distinct roots is, that R, shall be identically zero,
that is to 8ay, we must have

necessary and sufficient, they are but a selected s8ystem of equations of an infinite
number of similar equations whici subsist#, and taat, in fact, whatever be the value
of (1), we may take 7, 74...7; perfectly arbitrary and as great as we please, and the
equation
D

must exist by virtue of the existence of the n—z equations last above written.

Art. (4.) I now return to the question of expressing the successive quotients of 7!

as functions of the differences of the roots and factors: that they must be capable of
being 80 expressed is an obvious consequence of the fact, that the numerators and
denominators of the convergents have been p:t under that form, since if

Ns N;-, N;

D;-y Di-i D;
are any three consecutive convergents of the continued fraction

Q— Q- Q-
we must have
D;,.N;—N;_..D;=Q. It would not, however, be easy to perform the multiplications indicated in the above
equation, 80 as to obtain Q, under its reduced form as a linear fanction of xr. I pro-
ceed'therefore to ſind Q, constructively in the following manner.
