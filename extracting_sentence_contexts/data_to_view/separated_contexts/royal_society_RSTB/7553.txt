This accords
with the optomotor hypothesis of a preferred retinal velocity attainable at a height which
decreases with the wind speed. Higher fliers are less responsive to wind-speed changes in
accordance with the hypothesis of a maximum compensatory height above which no opto-
motor responses occur, this height increasing with the wind speed. The optomotor effect of
height is quite unconnected with the fact that wind speed generally increases with height,
a fact which in no way alters the hypothesis but which does complicate its detailed investiga-
tion and application. The optomotor effect is geometrical, varying directly with height,
whereas the wind speed does not change so fast with height. But since the wind speed does
increase somewhat with height, locusts climbing in moderate winds will tend to suffer
backward drift, compensated by reducing height, with the result that sustained flight in
