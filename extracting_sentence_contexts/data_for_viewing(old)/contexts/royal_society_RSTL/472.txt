to me last year by the President of the Royal Society, I observed,
that while the oxide of titanium was precipitated from the
muriatic acid in which it was dissolved, the excess of oxygen in
the oxide passed over to the muriatic acid and the potash,
already in the liquor, and that hyperoxygenized muriate of
potash was formed. I have attempted the same experiment with
black oxide of manganese, but could not succeed.

There is, however, a still more extraordinary formation of this
acid, in the distillation of nitro-muriatic acid upon platina. Oxy-
gen is absorbed by the metal ; yet, not only oxygenized, but also
hyperoxygenized muriatic acid is formed. I have repeated the
experiment several times; and am well convinced of the fact,
however contrary to theory it may appear. I have tried the
action of oxygenized muriatic acid upon nitric acid, in the hopes
of forming hyperoxygenized muriatic acid; but there was no
action to this effect among their elements.

The fact of the production of a peculiar gas, by the distilla-


upon oxygenized and hbyperoxygentzed muriatic Acid, &c. 165

tion of nitro-muriatic acid upon platina, has been observed by
Mr. Davy, in his Researches.* But, as hyperoxygenized muriatic
