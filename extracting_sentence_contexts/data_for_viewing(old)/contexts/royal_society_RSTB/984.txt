hile in captivity. Two large cages were put at my disposal in one of the Monkey
ses at the gardens, and an adult male with several females put in one cage, while

the other a pair of adult Monkeys were kept.
EMany of the females seemed quite prepared for copulation
gale to fertilize them, but without success.
ZT do not consider these observations at all conclusive towards establishing the fact
â€˜iat the animals in a wild state do not breed during these months ; S. entellus is a
Ypry shy animal, and the circumstances of captivity may well account for their non-

ing in the cages; at the same time, if the breeding season had begun before I

, it is highly probable I should have seen some evidence of the fact in one or more

Sf the numerous specimens I exammed.
4 With Macacus rhesus I was even less successful in obtaining material for work,
S Of several hundreds of these animals sent to me from the North-West Provinces
turing February and March, a very large proportion, probably not less than four-
fifths, bore advanced embryos in utero, or had lately borne young, or had recently
aborted the embryo.
In two specimens I found embryos of a stage probably similar to a six-weeks-old
human embryo, and these were the only specimens of breeding females I saw which
bore any but nearly full-grown embryos. The rest of the females were mostly young
ones, but about twenty-five were adults, not pregnant, and the uteri of these were
preserved for the investigation of menstrual phenomena.
