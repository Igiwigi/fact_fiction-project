biomimetic surfaces arrived surprisingly late with the introduction of the Velcro® principle in
1958. Superhydrophobicity plays a notable role only after 1997. The biomimetic technical potential
of biological surfaces was largely ignored over the last century, but it provided inspiration for
many exciting technical innovations in the last three decades. Ironically, the terms ‘bionic’ and
‘biomimetic’, as they are defined by the scientific community, are increasingly applied for purely
marketing reason to non-bionic (parabionic) products.

Biological evolution is a slow process spanning millions of years. It works by undirected
processes such as mutation and selection and thus tries all constructional possibilities—the vast
majority of mutations are detrimental and will disappear. But out of discussion are million
years of research and development for technical engineering: the material scientist has a goal
to fabricate a particular product in a limited time, using experimental trial-and-error approaches,
calculation and modelling. The crucial point is the fact that an engineer must have a particular
target of what he wants to reach. The unexpected, the unthinkable, cannot be in his thoughts: this
is the second crucial difference to biological evolution.

It may have taken a couple of decades to identify microscopic elastic egg-beaters with
nanoscopic wax crystals and hydrophilic pins for persistent air retention under water, but the
floating fern Salvinia had over 30 myr to perfect them by mutation and selection in its evolution.
We still have insufficient knowledge of the incredible spectrum of biological surface structures.
We do not even understand the structural base or function of the magnetic field like wax crystal
orientation on a leaf of the lily of the valley (figure 12) in our garden.


The current dramatic loss of biodiversity also means the loss of biological role models—the
