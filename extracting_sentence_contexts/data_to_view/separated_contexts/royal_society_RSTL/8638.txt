And is the tissue of the mucosa the same as that found in a follicle

of a Peye's patch? Tt is very important to be clear on this point, as it is certain that
fat-absorption cannot, be properly understood unless we perfectly understand the structure
of the villi, a fact which has been much lost sight of. The difference between the tissue
of the villus on the one hand and of a follicle of a PrysR's patch on the other, is not to
be found in the reticulum (which is identical or very similar), but in the cells contained
in that reticulum. In the lymphatic follicles, and in parts of the mucosa, the cells are entirely lymph-
corpuscles*, In the villi, though lymph-corpuscles are always present and may be
almost the chief constituent (as in the sheep), or an important constituent (as in the
rabbit), yet in s0me animals they are few in number (as in the dog and cat), or even
rare (as in the monkey), in this situation.
