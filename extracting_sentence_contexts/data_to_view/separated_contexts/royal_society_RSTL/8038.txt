Hence it is evident that the same invariant relation will eXxpress
for two conics on a quadric that the pole of the plane of each with respect to the qua-
dric lies on the plane of the other; and as circles s0 related cut orthogonally, we shall
extend the term as in art. 9, and say that two conics 80 related cut orthogonally. In
fact the relation 1-R=0 may be called (see art. 9) the harmonic invariant of the qua-
Arics or conics whose equations are connected by it. 67.
