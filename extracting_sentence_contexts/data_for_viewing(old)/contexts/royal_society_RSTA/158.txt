job environment and the main output files. Data generated by collaborators can
then be discovered from the metadata catalogue (figure 1, left and bottom
arrows; Tyer et al. 2007).

— By harvesting core output data as metadata in addition to the standard types of
data descriptions, we have shown that the metadata tools can provide a useful
interface to data, e.g. using our rcew tool researchers can collate output quantities
from many jobs run by their collaborators (figure 1, left and bottom arrows; Tyer
et al. 2007).

—Collaborators can communicate using video conferencing tools (such as the
Access Grip with application-sharing tools such as the eMinerals JMAST tool)
or instant messaging. In fact, our experience has found that instant messaging is
the most useful tool for immediate communication.

— Web 2.0 social networking tools (e.g. our SciSpace.net tool) enable collaborators
to share and document ideas, dialogues, images, dialogues and reports; we discuss
this in more detail next.

This set of tools enables researchers to easily share their data and information
with their collaborators, and similarly enable their collaborators to locate and
understand the information. They effectively bypass many of the time-consuming
