lead to infinities, or at all events, to discontinuities in the stress. In other words,
that, though we have chosen our constants so as to make (rr ).-« formally zero, yet
the limit of (77) as given by the series is not zero when 7 approaches a. This
would suggest that the series for rr, considered as a series of I-functions, behaves at
7 =a in much the same way as a discontinuous Fourier series whose general term
is sin nz behaves at z =z. In fact, if we differentiate rr in the usual way with
regard to v and then put 7 = a, we get a divergent series.

It is easily seen, beets | that no discontinuity really occurs except at the points
where the shear is applied discontinuously. The general term in rr is of the form
