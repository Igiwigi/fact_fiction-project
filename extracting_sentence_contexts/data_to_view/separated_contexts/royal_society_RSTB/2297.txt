This led us. to investigate the influence of a perforated diaphragm on the diffusion
of atmospheric CO, down a column of air in which the flow was at a maximum, that
is to say, only limited by the coefficient of diffusion of the gas. The interesting fact was then brought to light that as the end of the tube was
restricted the diffusive flow per unit area of aperture rapidly increased, and that
when the central hole had been diminished beyond a certain size relative to the cross-
section of the column, the amount of gas which passed became proportional to the
linear dimensions of the apertures. This is well shown in the following experiments :â€”

A series of similar flat-bottomed flasks was taken, having necks about 7 centims. long and about 23 millims. diameter at the mouth.
