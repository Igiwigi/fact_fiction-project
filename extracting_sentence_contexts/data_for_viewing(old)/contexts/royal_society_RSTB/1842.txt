that “It is hardly necessary to state again that the fused sporangia of Marattia are
a sorus, and not, as they had sometimes been held to be, a plurilocular sporangium ;
this follows from the fact that each sporangium, as in Angiopteris, has its own
special archesporium.”

We shall naturally accept the position that what is usuaily styled the sorus in
Marattia is a true sorus, comparable with that of Angiopteris, and of various other
ferns ; but the further point included in the above quotation from GorpEL does not
necessarily follow. Even if the fact were always as he states, that each sporangium
has its own special archesporium, this does not by any means prove that it was
separate by descent from its neighbours. And it has been shown above that, as a
matter of fact, occasionally in Maratiia, and much more frequently in Danea, each
sporangium has not always its own distinct archesporium. Moreover, while using
developmental evidence, little account has been taken by other writers of the structure
of the septa which separate the loculi; whereas their variable thickness and occasional
incompleteness are matters very material to the question before us. It will thus be
seen that the real nature of the sorus, and its mode of origin by descent, cannot be
settled simply by brief allusion to the usually separate archesporia ; as regards the
developmental evidence, the question must be considered as still an open one.

Srur, having in view chiefly the data derived from the study of fossils, has also
expressed his opinion as to the relative time of origin of the synangial condition in
certain Marattiacew.* Having summarised into a tablet those fossils of the Culm,
Coal Measures, and present periods, which he attributes to the Marattiacew, he argues
