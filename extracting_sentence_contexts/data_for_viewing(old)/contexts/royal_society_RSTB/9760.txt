Cys was used in studies of the ferrichrome-binding extracellu-
lar loop of FhuA [123], and epitope insertions were used to
study the topology of several OMPs in E. coli [124-127]. Inser-
tion of proteolytic sites was used to determine that surface-
exposed lipoproteins in Borrelia are anchored to the outer leaf-
let of OM [128]. These approaches are recommended only
when assays to test protein function and/or folding are avail-
able to demonstrate that epitope insertions do not interfere
with native protein topology. In our study of RcsF, we used
biotinylation, proteolysis and polyclonal RcsF antibodies to
show that RcsF is surface exposed [100]. However, FLAG epi-
tope walking across the entire protein sequence allowed us to
uncover the fact that ResF has an N-out C-in topology.

7. Concluding remarks

The lipoprotein biogenesis pathway, including lipoprotein
maturation and export to the OM by the Lol machine, has
been characterized in great molecular detail. Because lipopro-
tein insertion into the inner leaflet of OM is the last step in the
Lol pathway, the periplasmic paradigm for lipoproteins, in
which all lipoproteins are viewed as soluble periplasmic pro-
teins simply anchored to the inner leaflet of the OM by
N-terminal lipid moieties, was established. This assumption
delayed the discovery of many lipoproteins that interact
