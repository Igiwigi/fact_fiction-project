It has recently been discovered that the CS—US interval in
eyeblink conditioning is encoded by a cell-intrinsic mechanism
in the cerebellar Purkinje cell [56]. In the vast literature on the
neurobiology of memory, this is the only case in which
the engram for a specified quantitative experiential fact (the
duration of the CS—-US interval) has been localized—and it
has been localized to a sub-cellular level. In this case at least,
the numeron encoding the duration of an interval resides in a
cell-intrinsic medium, not in a plastic synapse.

These considerations—the metabolic and volumetric costs
and the fact that the CS—US interval is stored by a cell-intrin-
sic mechanism—lead me to seek answers at the cell-intrinsic
level, which is to say at the molecular level. At that level, it is
easier to find structures of the kind one would look for to
implement an efficient, versatile number-encoding scheme.

As mentioned in §1, it is easy to see how to encode numbers
into polynucleotide strings (DNA and RNA). These string-like
molecules are found in abundance inside every cell. Machinery
for constructing these strings is also present in every cell. Thus,
these strings are constructible as needed. Moreover, the com-
plementizing properties of these strings—the properties that
enable genes to make copies of themselves—are ready-made
