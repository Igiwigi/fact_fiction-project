It is s0mewhat remarkable that
the fallacy of this conelusion has never been observed, or at least pointed out. IN ELECTRO-MAGNETISM AND MAGNETO-ELECTRICITY. 315

He might as well have concluded that the conducting power was directly as
the square root of the area of the section, and inversely as the square root of
the length, or, in short, as the nth root of the area of the section, and inversely
as the nth root of the length. The fact is, M. BecquerEL has deduced the
values of two unknown quantities from one equation. Having shown that the laws of conduction, which we have examined, have
been deduced either by false processes of reasoning or by employing galvano-
meters founded on false principles, these laws must be equally fallacious.
