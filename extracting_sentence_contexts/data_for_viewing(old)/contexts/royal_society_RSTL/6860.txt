mediately takes place through the pores of the graphite. The
whole hydrogen will leave the tube in forty minutes or an hour, and is replaced by a much
8maller proportion of atmospheric air (about one-fourth), as is to be expected from the
law of the diffusion of gases. During the process, the mercury will rise in the tube, if

allowed, forming a column of several inches in height—a fact which illustrates strikingly
the intensity of the force with which the interpenetration of different gases is effected.
Native graphite is of a lamellar structure, and appears to have little or no porosity. It
cannot. be substituted ,for the artificial graphite as a diffusion-septum. Unglazed
earthenware comes next in value to graphite for that purpose.

The pores of artificial graphite appear to be really 80 minute, that a gas in mass
cannot penetrate the plate at all. It seems that molecules only can pass; and they may
be supposed to pass wholly unimpeded by friction, for the smallest pores than can be
imagined to exist in the graphite must be tunnels in magnitude to the ultimate atoms
of a gaseous body. 'The sole motive agency appears to be that intestine movement of
molecules which is now generally recognized as an essential property of the gaseous
condition of matter. :
