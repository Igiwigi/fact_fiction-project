HE and very small for but slightly ponderable media, would represent simply a change of
A Velocity due to slight unilateral change of effective elasticity somehow produced by
the motion through the quiescent medium of the vortices constituting the matter. 74. The notion of illustrating magnetic induction by the permeation of a fluid
through a porous medium containing obstacles to its motion has been shown by Lord
' Ketvryt to lead to a complete formal representation of the facts of diamagnetism ;
