The greatest motion of the pebbles being where they are exposed to the action of
the greatest number of waves, we must look to the lowerleyels of these flats to trace
the further course of the greater portion of the shingle. But even the slope of the
surface of the lower levels is s0 very gradual, that the undulating motion of the
water is proportionally diminished ; the action of the water then becomes greatest in
the direction of the land. While, then, we bear in mind the nature of the soil over
which it acts, we find an almost insurmountaþble impediment to the further progress
of the shingle, and are enabled to account for the rapid extension of the Sandwich
Flats towards the sea, which, in fact, is only the continuation of that process which
has been for ages in operation, and which has formed a large portion of those exten-
sive marshes between the Isle of Thanet and the main land of Kent. SECTION 6. Having described those chief principles which regulate the motion of the shingles
on this coast, and having traced their progress to a final destiny, I shall now proceed
with some further general remarks referring to the application of the foregoing ob-
servations.
