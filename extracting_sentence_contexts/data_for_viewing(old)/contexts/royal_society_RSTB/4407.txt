The idea of Pre-determination is very useful here. If the crop has been sown and
cultivated in a normal manner, and yet is, on the average, a “late” one, the fact
shows that the cause was most probably a deficient water supply during May, a time
to which less importance in this respect is commonly attributed than to June, since
it is in the latter month that the effects pre-determined by deficient water supply in
May are visible.

It is here that we obtain the first indication of a real major seasonal effect. Thus
far we have spoken of the water supply as if an actual deficiency of irrigation water
were involved, as it was in the curve G.’10, G. 11, and MK. ’13. But there may
very well be an effective shortage of water even when the irrigation supply is normal,
if the weather conditions are unusually stringent ; and in point of fact it is during
the months of May and early June that the abnormally hot days frequently
mentioned in this communication are likely to occur. The auto-toxic effects of such
days, whether caused directly by water-strain or by thermic effects, are mitigated or
even abolished if the soil is sufficiently wet, but it is difficult to ensure this in May,
when the plants are small, since the soil is not sufficiently shaded, and the roots have
not reached to any great depth.* On the whole, however, our analysis indicates that
the irrigation system of Egypt has perhaps been trading on rather too narrow a
margin in this matter of the early summer supply of water, because during the five
seasons covered by our data there is no sign of any delay in any of our sites under
normal cultivation, whereas for the country at large there were two very early
seasons and one late one within this period.
