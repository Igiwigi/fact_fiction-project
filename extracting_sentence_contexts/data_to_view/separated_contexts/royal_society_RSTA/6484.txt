It might, perhaps, be possible to detect some
effect of magnetisation on the temporary elongation produced by large loads when
the method of static extension is employed, but not with the arrangement used by
Werraemm. M. WertHerm seems to have taken no precautions to avoid the heating
effects of the magnetising solenoid, and the very fact that he was only able to detect
any change after the solenoid had been excited for some time points suspiciously to
heating as being the origin of what he observed. It is true that according to
Wenrruem the longitudinal elasticity of iron is increased by a small rise of tempera-
ture, but in this the author has ventured to differ from him.ยง

The Influence of an Electric Current on Longitudinal Elasticity. According to WERTHEIM|| the longitudinal elasticity of wires is diminished by the
passage of an electric current, independently of the alteration which would result

* The full arrangement for effecting this will be described in a future paper.
