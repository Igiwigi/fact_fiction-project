440 MR. E. A. SCHAFER ON THE MINUTE STRUCTURE OF

appearance on each ide of it is produced by a total reflection of the rays of light from
its surfaces—considering, from the fact of its similar behaviour under crossed Nicols,
the substance forming the clear stripe to be similar in nature to the rest of the muscle-
substance, with the exception of the Zwischensubstanz before mentioned. As a further
indication that the bright bands are due to such an optical effect as he described, HrrexeR
remarked that their position became altered according as the mirror was inclined or the
stage rotated.

Quite recently three important contributions to the study of the structure of striped
muscular fibre have appeared; those, namely, by FLoGeL*, MerKELF, and ENGELMANNY,
respectively. MERKEL, studying the fibres of the Arthropoda, principally by means of
alcohol preparations, finds the transverse line-of Knavss to be not simple, as believed by
the latter, but in reality to be made up of two lines representing juxtaposed membranes
(terminal disks or Zndscheiben), best seen when the fibre is stretched. He further
