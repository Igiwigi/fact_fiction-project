Thus, to calculate the time prior using fossil calibrations
and the birth—-death process, one must calculate: (i)
foo(te, telt1), Gi) fao(te|f1) and (iii) f(t.) x f(t). Calculating
(i) and (iii) is straightforward; however, it turns out that cal-
culating (ii) is in general very hard. In fact, here I show that
the procedure proposed by Yang & Rannala to obtain (ii)
leads to a misspecified density. Thus, Yang & Rannala’s
resulting conditional density for node ages without calibra-
tions, fgp(telte, 4), is also misspecified. The problem is
moderate, in the sense that the fossil calibration densities are
not affected, and estimated divergence times on the phylogeny
will be appropriately constrained by the fossil calibrations
specified by the user. However, the misspecified fgp(telt., t1)
density can look quite strange and sometimes can have mul-
tiple modes, and may thus lead to a multi-modal posterior
distribution for the ages of nodes without fossil calibrations.
Such misspecified densities may be biologically unrealistic.
