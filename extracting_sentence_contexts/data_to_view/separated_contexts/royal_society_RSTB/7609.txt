It has been pointed out (p. 243) that the
solid foundation to the Campden Tunnel Drift in the col between Dover’s and Ebrington
Hills has a level of somewhere between 400 and 414 ft. 0.p. according to Gavey’s section
(1853, p. 29). Consideration must therefore be given to the possibility that it too could
have functioned as an overflow, with water then getting away southward along the margin
of the ice which pressed against Dover’s Hill. The facts discussed on p. 243, which indicate
that Stretton sand with Welsh erratics was being deposited before Lake Harrison was
impounded, suggest that the Welsh ice was blocking the col with its own detritus before
there was any lake to escape, and raising the level of the gap to such a point that sub-
sequent overflow would be impossible. The subdrift contours of the Moreton gap cannot be drawn with precision, but it seems
impossible to make them sufficiently low for Lake Harrison to escape down the Evenlode. AREA BETWEEN COVENTRY, RUGBY AND LEAMINGTON 253

At a very late stage, however, when eastern ice was depositing the Moreton drift and the
Campden Tunnel gap was blocked with clays and gravels, there must have been a phase
when ponding occurred between Ebrington and Brailes Hills at a slightly higher level, with
the Moreton gap acting as overflow.
