indicate a use of the cave as a burial place in the transitional
period between Preboreal and early Boreal. This relatively
short time span and the fact that subadult individuals,
especially small children, are underrepresented, could indicate
that the cave was selectively used as a burial place by a larger
group or by several smaller groups over 100 or 200 years.

Similar radiocarbon dates have been found at two skulls
and a mandible from a sandpit at Greylake, Somerset, UK
(table 2). The human remains including postcranial fragments
representing a minimum of five individuals were excavated
in 1928, but dated only recently to the early Boreal. The
facts that skulls and long bones, together with some smaller
skeletal elements were preserved might indicate the presence
of complete burials at the site.

4. Conclusion

This review of the Late Upper Palaeolithic and early Meso-
lithic (Preboreal and early Boreal) European funerary record

may be incomplete, as several burials are still undated or
insecure and were, therefore, omitted from the study. In
various cases, new AMS radiocarbon dates have changed
previous attributions to the Late Upper Palaeolithic (LUP)
