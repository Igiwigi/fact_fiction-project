& On the fifth day the canal leading to the fourth left arch becomes fused with that

leading to the third, but the arch is still of undiminished size in its course dorsalwards.

The next series, figs. 27 to 30, show the arches of an embryo Chick about the begin-

gning of the sixth day. The fourth left arch is now reduced to a cord lying between
the carotid and pulmonary vessels, and it may be traced dorsalwards to the extremity

Sof the arches, where it probably joins the aortic root.

§ These facts account for the presence in some of the Raptores of a solid cord

Betretching from the innominate artery to the aorta. In most Birds this cannot be
sfound, and the fourth left arch has probably disappeared altogether. I am inclined to

athink, however, that in some cases the cord above described fuses with the coats of

‘gthe pulmonary arch immediately behind it, as I have found in certain instances
