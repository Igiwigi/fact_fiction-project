If the stomata are



MR. FRANCIS DARWIN ON STOMATA. 537

widely open, a reading can be obtained out of doors, but it cannot be an accurate one. SranL* points out that my hygroscopic index sinks to zero when the leaf on which
it rests is fanned ; he ingeniously makes use of the fact in his discussion on Desmodium
gyrans, in which he supposes the shaking of the terminal leaflets by the gyrating ones
renews the air on the surface and leads to increased transpiration. It will be seen,
therefore, that there is here a serious possibility of misinterpretation, since in a fanned
leaf the conditions of increased transpiration accompany a fall in the index. This
error is easily avoided if readings are not taken in a strong draught of air.
