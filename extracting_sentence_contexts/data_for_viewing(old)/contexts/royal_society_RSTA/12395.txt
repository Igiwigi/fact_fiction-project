hus we may say that all the cells set up by us after the last date of the Board of
drade circular agree among themselves and with our standard to about one part in
‘three thousand.

é § 22. Errors Arising at the Zine Pole. Effect of Amalgamation of the Zinc.
3 After a cell has been made, the paste, which, when poured into the test tube is
irly homogeneous, and of the consistency of cream, separates into two portions. The
-Bnore solid part, the mercurous sulphate, settles to the bottom, resting on the mercury,
and a clear liquid remains on the top. The zinc rods used varied somewhat in length ;
a some cells they were entirely in the clear liquid, in others they extended partly
into the more solid portion below. Various observations had shown us that this
Snight produce some difference in the behaviour of the cell.
q The differences appear to arise from the fact that when the zinc rod touches the
anercurous sulphate it becomes properly amalgamated. A small trace of iron in the
Zine, or in the zine sulphate solution, does not, then, produce any serious effect. the
owever, the zinc is only in the clear liquid, the amalgamation does not always take
lace. The zine, instead, frequently becomes covered with a grey deposit. This grey
Aleposit consists in the main of mercury in very fine globules, and when it is formed
all over the zinc the E.M.F. of the cell falls, and it becomes unsteady.

The experiments recorded in Table X. show the effects of this deposit and of the
method of treating it.

The cells in question were six, Nos. 42-47, constructed towards the end of April by
Mr. L, R. Witperrorce. The materials of the cells are indicated as above, by Greek
