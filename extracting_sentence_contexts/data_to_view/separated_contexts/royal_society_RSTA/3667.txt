loads for thin shells can be as low as 20% of the load for a perfect shell. These facts are well known
and there is a large experimental and theoretical literature going back almost 75 years addressing
the subject, especially for cylindrical shells under axial compression. Starting with the work of von Karman & Tsien [1] and Tsien [2], a major effort was made to
come to terms with the catastrophic nature and imperfection sensitivity of the buckling of elastic
spherical shells by studying the post-buckling behaviour of the perfect shell, with parallel efforts
on cylindrical shells under axial compression. Criteria involving load-carrying capacity and/or
energy in the post-buckling state were proposed to explain the low buckling loads measured in
tests and to serve as a guide for safe design.
