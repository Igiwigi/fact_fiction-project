Yet, the rapid SL observed in laboratory studies stands in
stark contrast to the slow unfolding of real-world language
acquisition where statistical knowledge emerges slowly in
children’s language. Robust perception of statistically reliable
phonological patterns in natural language does not emerge
until eight to 10 months of age, after children have had
many months of exposure to language [6-8]. For instance,
the perceptual reorganization documented by Werker &
Tees [6] is thought to reflect the influence of statistical knowl-
edge on phonetic categories in natural language [9]. Such
categories are thought to constrain infants’ ability to detect
non-native contrasts by eight to 10 months despite the fact
that infants show rapid SL of phonetic categories as early
as six months in a laboratory study [9].

How do we resolve the seeming inconsistency of rapid
extraction of statistics in the laboratory with the slow pace of
real-world language learning? For one, laboratory stimuli are
often highly focused on the pattern to be learned with high
density input, whereas real-life input may occur in spaced
intervals with exceptions to the most reliable patterns depend-
ing on the language. For another, learners must retain SL over
time. I focus on this latter issue, the retention of SL as the major
topic of this paper. To address the puzzle of rapid extraction of
