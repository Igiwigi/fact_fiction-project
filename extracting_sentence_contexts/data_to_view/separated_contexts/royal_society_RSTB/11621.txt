The most widespread
of the two herbivores, caribou, are also domesticated in many of these regions. We will here explore how this low species richness of large herbivores influences
the vulnerability of arctic ecosystems to climate change, especially warming. We
also discuss implications of the fact that only domesticated herbivores exist in
many parts of the Arctic. THE ROYAL SOCIETY
