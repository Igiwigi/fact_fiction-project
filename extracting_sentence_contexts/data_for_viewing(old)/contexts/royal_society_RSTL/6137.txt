Same line; in fact, taking arbitrarily a point out of each pair, the points 80 obtained
form a system which is homographic with the system formed with the other points of

the several pairs; and in this case the sibiconjugate points of the involution are also the
sibiconjugate points of the homography. Thus if A and A', B and B', C and C', D and

homographic point-systems ; and, as a particular case, (A, B, C, C') and (A', B', C', C)
