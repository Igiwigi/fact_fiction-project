This loss of charge was no doubt brought about by means of the ionization in the
air surrounding the conductor. The known behaviour of an ionized gas, however,
would have led one to expect a somewhat different result, especially in regard to the
effect obtained with short distances between the windows. When an insulated metal
conductor is placed in air ionized by Réntgen rays, ZELENY* has shown that, owing
to the greater velocity with which the negative ions diffuse, this conductor takes up a
small negative charge, while the gas itself is left with a positive one. If then the
ionizations in the two cases are of the same nature, one would have expected that in
Lenarp’s experiments the wire and electroseope would not, under any circumstances,
have been finally discharged completely, but would have been left with at least a small
negative charge. When, further, it is remembered that the impinging cathode rays
themselves carried a negative charge to the wire, this fact affords an additional reason
for expecting such a result.

‘Now the gold-leaf electroscope, as used by Lenarp (EXxNeEr’s type), was not
sensitive to small differences of potential, and it was consequently not a suitable
instrument for the detection and measurement of effects of this kind, As the
explanation of his results seemed, then, to be connected with this lack of sensibility
in the measuring instrument, his experiments were repeated, and a quadrant elec-
trometer was used in place of the electroscope.
