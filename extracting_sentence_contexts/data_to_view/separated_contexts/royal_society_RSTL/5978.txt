Further, we often find, in the central portions of a glacier, the structure feeble, or
where the glacier moves through a valley of tolerably uniform inclination, and where
no medial moraines occur to complicate the phenomenon. But if the veins mark the
the centre as at the sides; the fact, however, certainly is that we do not 80 find them. Let me here show the true significance of this fact. If a plastic substance, such as
lateral ones which are held back by friction. Now the flow may be 80 regulated that a
circle stamped upon the central portion of snch a mud-stream shall move downwards
stretched longitudinally ; for if the former, the circle would be squeezed to an ellipse
with its major axis transverse to the axis of the stream ; and if the latter, it would be
absence of longitudinal compression exists in many glaciers, and #7 84ch ice-streams there
is no transverse central structure developed.
