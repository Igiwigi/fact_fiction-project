11 TECTUM OPTICUM, figs, 2-6, 14-17, 20, T.O.

It is not the purpose of the present investigation to include a detailed description
of the histology of the optic tectum. For a histological analysis of the tectum the
reader is referred to the work of Fusart (1887), Krause (1898), Cayat (1899, 1911),
Kappers (1906, 1921), and Rapt (1915).

For modifications of the tectum in teleosts having defective vision there are accounts
by Ramsey (1901) and Cuaruron (1933).

An examination of the figures shows that the optic systems of Diaphus and Saurida
are fairly well developed but that that of Bathypterois is decidedly atrophic. In fact,
the optic nerves and optic tracts of Bathypterois are reduced to small fascicles of
poorly medullated fibres, figs. 12 and 13, as are also the oculomotor, the trochlear,

and the abducens nerves. Bathypterois is only found at great depths and always near
the ocean bottom ; hence the atrophied optic system is probably correlated with
the absence of light.
