He interpreted the
sulcus retrocalcarinus verticalis as a Y-shaped sulcus occipitalis superior (calcarinus
externus) with its stem detached and extending to the lateral surface. Having
done so, he proceeded to name the medial operculum as the inner portion of the
sulcus lunatus. He goes on to say :—

“That this is really the upper portion of the sulcus lunatus is evidenced by
the fact that the cortex immediately behind it is operculated, and shows a definite
streak of Vicq’ d’Azyr running nearly up to the edge of the fissure. The lower
portion of it which normally lies in front of the sulcus occipitalis superior is
apparently obliterated ”’. It is to be noted that FLasHMaN says obliterated and does not suggest displacement
dorso-medially.
