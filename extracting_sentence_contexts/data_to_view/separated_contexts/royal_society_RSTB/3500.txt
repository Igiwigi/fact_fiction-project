This is
explained by the fact that the upward movement brings them more quickly to the upper
surface, and that they form here, before cohesion has had time to take effect, a more
continuous layer than is possible in a deeper cell, where the upward movement is
more irregular, and cohesion begins to take effect before they have formed a homo-
geneous layer. As we have seen previously, the aggregation is never so regular or perfect in
a deep vessel as in a shallow one. In a deep cell the movements of the Euglenz are
not so regular, owing to the longer distances to be covered, and the fact that the
upward movement is nev√©r a perfectly upright one, but always along a more or less
spiral path, which varies according to the intensity with which the movements of the
organism are directed. Consequently, their accumulation into masses or layers, and
their subsequent production of cohesion figures is more irregular (Plate 35, figs. 35, 36). If the Euglenz are very few in number in a shallow cell, they may aggregate at
once into rather large groups without the intervention of a definite network (Plate 34,
figs. 25-28).
