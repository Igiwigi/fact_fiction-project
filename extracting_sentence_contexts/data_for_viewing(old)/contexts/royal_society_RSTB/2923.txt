blood is found to be clotted within, especially the portal veins, the pulmonary arteries
and the right side of the heart, as shown by Lamp (5). D. D. Cunniyenam (11),
however, showed some years ago that by repeated injections of slightly sub-minimal
lethal doses at intervals of 20 minutes or so, a slow form of poisoning without
convulsions, but with haemorrhages similar to those which occur in man, could be
produced. After death in such a case there will be no intravascular clotting found.
Again, Wau (3) pointed out years ago that if Daboia venom is heated for a short
time to 100 F. its action appears to be altered, the primary convulsions no longer
appearing, but a gradual failure of respiration occurs terminating in respiratory
convulsions of a secondary nature, much as in many cases of poisoning by the venom
of the Rattlesnake. The above references sutlice to show what different opinions
have been held as to the action of the Daboia venom, while the whole of the known
facts appear to be difficult to satisfactorily explain on any hypothesis yet put forward.
In order to try und throw some light on the question I have taken simultaneous
tracings of the respirations and blood pressure curves with interesting and
instructive results.

Blood Pressure and Respiratory Curves.

Experment I.â€”In the first experiment a sufficient dose was given intravenously to
produce rapid death with primary convulsions. A Cat, weighing 2 kg., was
chloroformed and 2 mg. (1 mg. per kilogramme) was injected into the external
jugular vein, the blood pressure of the carotid artery and the respirations, by
means of a tracheal tube connected with a Sanpsrr6m's recorder, being taken.
