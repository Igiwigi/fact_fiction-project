in this way sufficiently often to place the fact*beyond doubt;
I next began to consider its relations to other facts formerly
known. TI very soon: perceived, that the. immediate exciting
cause of these motions could ' not be derived from the action
of the metals upon the muscle and nerve, to which they
were applied ; otherwise it must have” been admitted, that
my body and a metal formed together a hetter' conductor
of the exciting influence than a metal alone, the contrary of
which I had known, from many experiments, to be the case.
The only source, therefore; to which it could possibly be re-
ferred, was the action. of the metals upon _my own body. It
then occurred to: me, that a proper opportunity now offered
itself of determining, whether animals contribute to the pro--
duction of this influence by means of any other property than
