Further, it is found that in every
case the same velocity constant is obtained after a time. It follows from this that
the combining chlorine and carbon monoxide when exposed to light of a certain
intensity and composition, always acquire after a certain time the same constant
properties, the same chemical affinity to one another. The fact that the same
constant was found in all curves of the same system, and that the investigation was
carried on as far as 80°66 per cent. (in Tables I. and II.) and 39°16 per cent. (in
Table IIL.) of the total amount of possible combination, shows that the above
equation (3), p. 377, which is a true expression of the law of mass action, truly
represents the fundamental law underlying chemical kinetics in light. At the same
time the last two columns of the above tables illustrate beyond any doubt that it is
no longer possible to assume that a law analogous to Farapay’s for electrolysis
governs the phenomena of chemical kinetics in light. Instead of getting a constant in the last columns, the values of da/dr-100 fall
from 25°2 to 4°1 (in Table II.), and from 40 to 18°6 (in Table IIT.), and the values of

4 ,A—® (in Table IL) fall from 50-9 to 9:9, and (in Table TIL) from 205
