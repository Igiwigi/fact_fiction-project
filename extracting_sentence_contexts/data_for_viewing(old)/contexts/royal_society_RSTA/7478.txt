negative results have proved to have in fact a quite marked de Haas-van Alphen effect.
From a purely empirical point of view this suggests that a further increase of field to, say,
30000 G might well show up the effect in some of the metals listed in table 10 as giving
negative results. According to the theory for an ideally free electron gas, an effect should
show up appreciably only at very much higher fields, of the order of 100000G, and the
period would then be of the order of 50 G, so very special experimental conditions would

be necessary to observe it. Since we should expect that this ‘ideal’ theory would apply at
least qualitatively to metals such as copper, in which the Fermi surface does not cross any
Brillouin zone boundaries, it would in fact be surprising from a theoretical point of view
if any appreciable de Haas-van Alphen effect were observed with such metals at fields much
less than 50000G.

The steady anisotropy

The steady anisotropy of most of the specimens was measured at room temperature (say
290° K), at 80 and at 4-2° K, and the data obtained are summarized in table 11 and com-
pared with some other determinations where they exist. Except for mercury, no correction
has been applied for any couple due to the empty mounting which is, of course, irrelevant
for the oscillating part of the anisotropy; this couple, probably due to ferromagnetic
contaminations, was usually appreciable but varied from one experiment to another, so
that neglect of it leads to an error which has not always the same magnitude. It is unlikely
