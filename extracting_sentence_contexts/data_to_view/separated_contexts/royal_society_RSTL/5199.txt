Plate V. figs. 6-8. A little consideration will show that the intestine drawn into this must become
bent towards the hamal side, as in fact it is in the embryos of all three groupsFÞ. Upon embryological grounds, then, we shonld establish two great primary modifi-
cations of the molluscous archetype; the one characterized by the development of an
abdomen, and a consequent neural flexure of the intestine ; the other marked by the
development of a post-abdomen, and the consequent hemal flexure of the intestine. But these modifications of anatomical structure exactly correspond with those
which T have already demonstrated, upon anatomical grounds, to occur in the Ptero-
poda and Heteropoda; and I trust I am not overstepping the bounds of legitimate
analogy, in assuming that the anatomical fact of a neural flexure indicates the em-
bryological development of an abdomen ; that of a hzmal flexure, the development
of a post-abdomen ; and that therefore the Pteropoda fall into the same category with
the Cephalopoda and Pulmonata ; the Heteropoda into that of the Pectinibranchiata,
Tectibranchiata and Nudibranchiata.
