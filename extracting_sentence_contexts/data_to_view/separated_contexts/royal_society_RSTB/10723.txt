Second, we analyse the temporal changes of ASR

and animal societies’. Keywords: in natural amphibian populations using data from the literature, and find
adult sex ratio, amphibians, climate change, that ASR shifted towards males in ZZ/ZW species over the past 60 years,
masculinization, sex-determination systems, but did not change significantly in XX/XY species. Our results highlight the
temperature-induced sex reversal fact that we need a better understanding of the interactions between genetic

and environmental sex-determining mechanisms to predict the responses of
ectotherms to climate change and the associated extinction risks. This article is part of the themed issue ‘Adult sex ratios and reproductive
