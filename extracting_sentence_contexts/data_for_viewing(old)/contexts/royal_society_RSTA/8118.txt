THE COMBUSTION OF COLLOIDAL PROPELLANTS. 397

the general expression (8). For example, if a mean value be taken for the terms in
the denominator the expression.

is immediately derived. Tf T be assumed constant, the equation takes approximately
the form

a form which numerically ean be closely fitted by a pressure-index law.* If allowance
be made for the fact that under closed vessel conditions the temperature at the start
is lower than the mean gas temperature during the explosion, the values so derived
can be made to conform to numerical values given by the expression

_p4f_
Da = A+ Bp,

where A is small. The quantity usually written @ in the first of these three approxi-
mations (the form in most general use) is in effect equal to

BT,
