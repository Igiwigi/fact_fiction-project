On raising the posterior border of the second plane of muscles, a large nerye, the infra-
orbital branch of the fifth pair, was seen emerging from the foramen in the superior
maxilla; it divided into three branches, which were traceable into the muscles and inte-
guments of the nares. As the blowholes are the only orifices through which the atmospheric air is allowed.
to pass during the act of respiration, we find accordingly that these outlets are amply
provided with the means of carrying on this important function. Their alz can be
divaricated by the simultaneous action of the superficial and deep muscular planes, and,
on the other hand, they could be brought together by the middle plane of fibres, which
from their fasiculi running in an elliptical direction on each side of the blowholes,
formed a regular sphincter and approximate the external lips of the orifices ; at the same
time the central portion of the muscle, from its deep-seated position, would press the ex-
ternal or alar cartilages against the septum, and 80 completely close these passages; the
Pressure of water from the outside may account for the fact that the muscles for opening
are much more powerful than those for closing these canals,

There are some points worthy of notice respecting the mechanism by which the func-
tions of respiration and deglutition are performed, in this and other Cetaceans, which we
think have not hitherto been clearly explained. As regards the first or respiratory function, it is obvious that when the animal ap-
proaches the surface of the ocean its first act will necessarily be that of expiration, in
order to expel from its lungs the deoxidized air contained therein after the preceding
inspiratory act ; expiration is accomplished in a great measure, as in other mammals,
by the contraction of the abdominal muscles drawing in the ribs, and propelling upwards

the musculo-tendinous diaphragm, and thus forcibly diminishing in every direction the
- capacity of the thorax; this action, from the great mobility of the ribs, their non-attach-
ment anteriorly, and the obliquity of their position, can in these animals he carried to an
. extent proportionally greater than in any other mammals. Whilst this is being accom-
- Plished the entire larynx is drawn forwards and elevated, and the posterior and internal
lips of the arytenoid bodies being at the same time brought into contact, form by being
overlapped and covered by the flexible margins of the epiglottis a protrusible tube; in
this state the upper opening of the glottis is extended into the pharyngeal orifice of the
nares.
