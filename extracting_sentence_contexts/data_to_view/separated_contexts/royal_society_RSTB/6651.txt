The age of these lavas has been fixed by interbedded lake deposits which
can be related by their altitude and contained fossils to beaches of known age within the
lake basin. North-west of Kulal Peak and north of Elmolo Bay is Borr Hill, a prominent cone of
aegirine-phonolite. It is in fact an outlier of the older rocks (Miocene?) which stretch
away to the north, where they form the rocky coastline of Longendoti as far as Alia
Bay. Ina journey from northern Horr to Alia Bay the east extension of the same lava
fields was encountered. It then became apparent that although overlain by younger
lavas in places, as at Galass Waterhole and again at Gaza, the main series of lavas was
older and had been faulted (and folded?) by forces acting in an east-west direction.
