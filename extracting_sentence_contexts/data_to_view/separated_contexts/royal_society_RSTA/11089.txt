Very slight variations, it is true, do
A occur, attributable most probably to the presence of impurities in the gelatine or in
the salts employed, or to slight heating by the current in spite of the constant
temperature bath. But such small deviations from perfect constancy need not be
considered at present. A third line of evidence is found in the fact that, while it is possible to greatly
vary the relative velocities of the same indicators by using different salt-jellies, it is
found that the relative rates of advance of the two boundaries remain the same with
different indicators and the same salt-jelly. The latter part of this statement has,
however, so far been tested only by the substitution of potassium ferrocyanide, and by
that of a tartrate solution, for the usual chromate in experiments with potassium
