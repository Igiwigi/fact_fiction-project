All of the ESS analysis so far has concerned a single pheno-
typic trait. However, the principle of invasion fitness can also
be applied to multiple coevolving traits [195-197]. When mul-
tiple traits coevolve, issues of pleiotropy and genetic constraint
immediately arise as mutations may not cause independent
effects along the different phenotypic dimensions. Thus,
even in the case of two coevolving traits, genetic constraints
owing to the underlying genetic architecture can have strong
effects on long-term evolution and the resulting ESSs. The
study of coevolving traits is nothing new to quantitative gen-
etics [198-200] where the importance of genetic constraints
has long been emphasized. In fact, recent work by Mullon &
Lehmann [197] ties together the quantitative genetic and inva-
sion fitness approaches for coevolving traits. By building from
an invasion fitness perspective that is comfortable with fitness
as a complex function of species ecology and behaviour, this
synthetic approach shows how pleiotropy, demography and
behaviour can interact to shape the coevolution of two syner-
gistic social traits [197].

Many conceptual divides in evolutionary theory have
been bridged in recent decades including divides surround-
ing ESS analysis and its role in genotypic and phenotypic
