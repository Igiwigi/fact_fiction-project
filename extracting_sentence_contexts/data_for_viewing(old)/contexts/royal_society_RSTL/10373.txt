cylinders increase steadily in diameter, in the number of their component vessels, and
in the dimensions of the cellular medulla which they enclose, until we reach the largest
axial bundles of the arborescent stems.* The fact that all the specimens hitherto
found below a certain diameter have the 80lid vascular bundle whilst all above that
* This increase seems to be partly explained by what I have said on p. 466 about fig. 20.

diameter have the hollow ones, inclines me to adhere to my. former opinion that
differences are merely due to age : a conelusion strengthened by the fact, that 8011;
axial bundles are equally absenb from every specimen of considerable 8ize that we
have as yeb obtained from any British locality. At the same time it is possible that
this opinion may some day require” modification,

The late Mr. Bixxgy held the view that the Zalonie were the roots, and not the
branches, of some Lepidodendroid plants. M. RexAvurz, in his recent © Cours de
Botanique Fossile,” advocates the view thab some alonie are what he terms
* Stigmarhizomes ” or semisubterranean creeping stems. Structural evidence compels
me to reject both these conclusions.* Mr. CarruUTHERs arrived at the same conclusion
as I had done from his study of some specimens which he described in 1873.4
Recently visiting the museum of the Leeds Philosophical Society, I found on their
shelves the magnificent and mos conclusive specimen of a branching Lepidodendron,
