ROTATING A DIELECTRIC IN A MAGNETIC FIELD. 127

The speed counter was supported on a steel rod, so that it could be slipped up and
down into position, and oil was supplied to the screw thread through a pipe leading
to the oil reservoir. The number registered by the revolution counter in about
2 minutes was usually taken when determining the speed. It was found that the
speed observed agreed very nearly with that deduced from the speed of the motor
and size of the pulleys, and also that the speed remained very constant for long
intervals of time. In fact, no appreciable variation of the speed ever occurred
during any of the experiments, the results of which are recorded in this paper.

The motor and solenoid were run from two different sets of cells, so that varying the
eurrent in the solenoid did not affect the voltage on the motor. This latter voltage
was always indicated by a Weston voltmeter, so that if any change in it occurred, it
was at once known that something was wrong. The current through the solenoid
was measured by a very good Weston ammeter, which read from 0 to 20 ampéres,
and it could be reversed by means of a mereury-cup commutator.

The motor and the apparatus described were screwed down to a large wooden
board, which was supported on a stone slab in the Cavendish Laboratory. Heavy
weights were placed on the board, and the apparatus was very steady, even when
