MEDIAL SPACES

1. In odd dimensional space [24 — 1] linear spaces [k—1] occupy a central position,
that of being self-dual. For this reason it is desirable to give them a special name, and
I propose to call them medial spaces or briefly medials. Thus a point is a medial on a
line, a line is a medial in a plane, and a plane in [5], and so on.

Two medials A and C, which have no point in common, form a basis, in the sense
that every point of space [2k—1] either belongs to A or C, or else is in line with a point
aofA and cof C. In fact the k-fold space containing A and any external point d intersects
the (k—1)-fold C in one point c: and the straight line cd, lying in the space Ac, must
meet A in a point a.

Analytically let te U te amaston es es Hin Yoseees Ved (1)

be the homogeneous co-ordinates of a point of [2k —1], referred to the medials A and C
as basis: that is to say, let any point of A be given by {x, 0}, and any point of C by {0, y}.
Here x is to be regarded as a column vector of k components, as also y, while {x, y}
denotes a column vector of all 2k components in the above order. We shall call {x,y}
the matrical co-ordinates of the point referred to the basis A, C.

This basis is one of ,,C, ways of dividing the simplex of reference into two equal sets
