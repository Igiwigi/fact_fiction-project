to be revealed (for example, the transition from woodland-
dominated to grassland-dominated faunas seen in the long
interglacial of MIS 11c), this is not the prime factor in govern-
ing species representation in Britain. Similarly, interglacials
characterised by enhanced summer warmth compared to the
present day (MIS 5e, MIS 9e) and dense deciduous-mixed
woodland produce very comparable suites of mammals but
are not the highest in species numbers. Instead, the highest
species diversity is found in relatively cool interglacials such
as MIS 7c-a, characterised by high insolation variability and
in association with predominantly dry, open grassland habi-
tats. This highlights the fact that the disappearance of the
permanent land bridge to the European continent during
MIS 12 did not cause a significant decline in numbers of
taxa reaching Britain in subsequent interglacials. This under-
lines the exceptional ability of mammals to disperse rapidly
into Britain from refugia during periods of climatic
amelioration.
