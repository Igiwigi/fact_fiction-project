On the other hand, one pathogen sometimes generates many strains with different
spreading features. Competitive multi-virus propagation shows very rich behaviour, beyond that
of single-virus propagation, hence a detailed investigation of multi-virus epidemic dynamics is
required [32-35]. In fact, this occurs not only in the process of epidemic spreading; information
transmission also shows competition with other information in the same population [36,37]. In [33], competing strains in heterogeneous networks were studied, and the existence of an
epidemic threshold in the presence of other strains in the susceptible-infected—susceptible (SIS)
model was confirmed by using the heterogeneous mean-field approach. In [38], the Miller—Volz
model [28-30] was used to study two competing products within the same market.
