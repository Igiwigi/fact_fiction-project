In many regions the linkage is so complicated that it seems impossible
to exhibit it in one map. Four maps are used to show the connections, a chain leaving
a map at one line and passing on to the same line on another map. Amongst such a
large number there must be many coincidences, and in fact the presence of some of
them is shown by cycles in which the links do not identically annul one another. There are also a few cases of chains which appear to pass on to other independent
linkages. It will be necessary, therefore, at first to make an attempt to clear up
these ambiguities.
