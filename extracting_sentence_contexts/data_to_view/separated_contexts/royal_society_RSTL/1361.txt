Here then I might rest with
regard to those conclusions ; however, I find it useful to add
the following explanations, in order to avoid further misun-
derstanding. F

1. Although, according to those results, there is no doubt,
that the atmosphere of Venus is as dense as that of our earth,
yet I do not see in fact, from my observations, how we can con-
found, against all analogy, a general density, with particular,
local and accidental, temporary modifications and condensa-
tions into clouds; and 50 positively deny all transparency to this
atmosphere, as to assert that in the sbining of the planet we see by

no means the light of its body, but merely that of its atmo-
s√æbere. Notwithstanding the density of this atmosphere, we must na-
turally consider it as generally clear and transparent, like our
own, and that of the moon, and as losing its transparency only
where its matter becomes really condensed ; which condensa-
tions, however, may be supposed not always to appear like dark-
er spots to an observer on our earth, but to remain often imper-
ceptible to him.
