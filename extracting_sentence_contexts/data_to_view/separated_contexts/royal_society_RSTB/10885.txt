However, in the DOM-system, in a small number had intermediate RRs. What if the optimal constant RR is
of cases, the CD-strategy failed even at intermediate asym- zero? Intuitively, one would expect that CD-strategies have
metries, despite the fact that the total proportion of outcomes no chance when selection rejects recombination. However,
with fixation of the modifier allele conferring OC-strategy in Gessler & Xu [43] and Hadany & Beker [44] showed that
the DOM-system was nearly four times lower than in the CD-strategies could be favoured in haploids, even in such situ-
NEQ-system (table 1). A similar pattern was observed when ations.
