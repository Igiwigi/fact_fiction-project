The numbers in these two groups are, to within the limits of the error of experiment,
constant. Accordingly we may assume that if v, v', and v” are the volumes at the same tem-
perature of quantities of the solutions, the volume of each of which at 0? C. is unity, the

v—v , 6 Y
value of ,,— is independent of the temperature, and is therefore, if the solutions to

which »' and v” refer are 8upposed to be always the same, a function of s (the specific
gravity of the third solution at 0* C.) only, s0 that

Secondly, noticing that the numbers in each of the above groups are approximately
-equal to each other and to unity, and bearing in mind the fact that the differences

between the specific gravities of the solutions employed, which are
004355, 003748, and -004160
respectively, differ in the fourth place of decimals, we are led to the conclusion that F(s)
is a linear function of s, and that differences in the fourth place of decimals in the value
of the specific gravities do not involve important changes in the law of thermal
expansion. From this it follows that equation (1), when written at length, is of the form

v=1l+bt+t +df+(0t+f+df) (p+gs), ©» - (2)
v=6(t)+W2/(3)*

As this expression is of no theoretical value, it is unnecessary to describe, step by step,

or

the arithmetical operations by which the constants were determined ; it is sufficient to
say that a larger number of equations than that required for the purpose may be obtained
by equating the coefficients of 7 in (2) to their values as determined for the solutions
submitted to experiment and given in Table XII., and that the numbers given by the
equations of condition 80 obtained have been in some cases slightly modified.
