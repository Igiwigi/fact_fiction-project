now supposed to contain three genera, may show such a distribution as the following :—

Of course, in actual fact, the dispersal will not be so simple. Even in one country,
the climate and other conditions will vary from place to place, so that the actual
distribution can very rarely be a circle or even an ellipse, unless just at the start in
such a flat country as Russia. As the forms spread, their dispersal will be altered by
geographical obstacles such as chains of mountains, arms of the sea, etc., and geological
changes will also affect it. But the underlying principle will remain the same.

Now, when one comes to examine the distribution of almost any order, one finds
that it may be very well explained on such principles. I have here taken the
Menispermaces, but the distributions already given of the Dilleniacewe and Podos-
temacew, etc., in other papers agree perfectly well with it, and, in fact, so do most
orders. The following rough map gives sufficient to show the general outline of the
dispersal of this family.
