© Rodriguez, in fact, consists of Doleritic layas that appear to haye been poured
out at a considerable number of yolcanic orifices at successive periods. It would be
difficult, without more minute description of the physical geography of the island
than is accessiþle, to assign any precise date or duration to these volcanic eruptions,
or to trace with any certainty the degree to which and the mode in which sabse-
quent denudation has helped in giving the island its present remarkable aspect. But the fact-of that denudation and the degree to which alteration has proceeded
in affecting the minerals composing rocks that by their position must have been
among the later of the out-poured lavas, would point to a remote date, possibly to
one contemporary with the tertiary period, as that of the volcanic activity of
Rodriguez. A central ridge, lofty for an island of only about 13 miles in length by 5 in
width, divides the north from the south, except that a break occurs at about two-
thirds of the distance from east to west. A succession of peaks on this ridge range
ſrom the Mount Quatre-vents, which forms the western bastion, 1,120 feet
high, of the central mass of the island, to the Grande Montagne, which is 1,140
feet in height, and looks into the steep valleys of the rivers Gr6vier, Palmiste,
de I'Est, and Bouteille, that lead down from it in a semicirele to the sea around the
eastern end of the island.
