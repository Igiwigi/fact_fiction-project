Another remark which is essential is that the evidence as to the zoological
relations of geographical areas afforded by different groups of the animal kingdom is
by no means the same. For the purpose of defining geographical subdivisions, it is
convenient to regard different orders and families as of equivalent importance, and
afterwards to consider the bearing of divergent evidence on the history of both the
animals and the region. But there are several facts which should not be forgotten,
Amongst certain divisions of the animal kingdom the species appear to arrange them-
selves naturally into genera and families, and no doubt can exist as to the limits of
such groups. They are, as a rule, I believe, more ancient types in which differentia-
tion has become well marked. In other divisions, it is extremely difficult to classify
either genera or families, the species, which are frequently just as liable to run into
each other as are the larger groups, being generally numerous, and without those
breaks, caused by the dying out of intermediate forms, which enable the larger
groups to be easily recognised.
