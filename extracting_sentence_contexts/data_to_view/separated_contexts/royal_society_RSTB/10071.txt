The
archetypes presented here are the latest progression in that
theoretical advancement, but the underlying characteristics
that allow those comparisons are the means to collect uniform
data on social conditions and compare them in ways that can
generate theory. The present authors would not presume that the arche-
types presented here for the Western USA can be directly
applied anywhere. In fact, it would be antithetical to our
argument that approaches for wildfire management must
be congruent with why people live in a given locale and
with the existing social organization in such a place. For
our region, the WUI typology is a step towards potentially
better wildfire management and planning that avoids the
problems of one-size-fits-all thinking. We would argue however, that the logic of understanding
local populations, and taking advantage of local knowledge
and social organization in thinking through approaches to
complex natural resource problems such as wildfire are
broadly applicable.
