(3) The functional conversion of scales into teeth is merely a primitive feature which
is likely to have been practised by the ancestors of all gnathostomes.

(4) The five branchial arches may be paralleled by the five which sometimes occur
in Acanthodes.

(5) The Selachian-like shoulder girdle is a definite point of resemblance. In some
Acanthodians, e.g. Diplacanthus and Cheiracanthus, there is evidence that in addition to
the dorsally directed scapula there was a downwardly and inwardly directed coracoid,
which might meet its fellow in a symphysis. In Climatius the scapula region is quite
like the corresponding structure in Macropetalichthys, and a coracoidal extension
certainly existed although it is not ossified. The primary shoulder girdle of Diplacanthus
is in fact like that of Macropetalichthys.

(6) The tribasal pectoral fin of Macropetalichthys with its short radials is directly
comparable, except for the absence of a spine, with that of Acanthodes or Ischnacanthus.
I have already shown that such a fin is not found in the earliest Elasmobranchs and
that its occurrence in a Lower Devonian fish is on the whole evidence against Elasmo-
branch affinities. The very remarkable pelvic fin of Macropetalichthys is of course
comparable with a primitive Elasmobranch like Cladoselache, but it is equally similar
to the primitive pelvic fins found in Sturgeons and in Saurichthys and Palaconiscids.

There remain only two of STENsIoâ€™s comparisons.
