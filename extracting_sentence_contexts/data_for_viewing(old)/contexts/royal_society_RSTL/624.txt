When kitchen utensils are used over a fire of sea-coal, or of
wood, there will be no necessity for blackening their bottoms,
for they will 800n be made black by the smoke; but, when
they are used over a clear fire made with charcoal, it will be
adviseable to blacken them; which may be done in a few mo-
ments, by holding them over a wood or coal fire, or over the
flame of a lamp, or candle.

Proposals have often been made for constructing the broad
and shallow vessels (flats) in which brewers cool their wort, of
metal; on a supposition that the process of cooling would go
on faster in a metallic vessel than in a wooden vessel; but this
would not be found to be the case in fact, a metallic surface
being ill calculated for expediting the emission of caloritic
Tays.

The great thickness of the timber of which brewers flats are
commonly made, is a circumstance very favourable to a speedy
cooling of the wort; for, when the flats are empty, this mass of
wet wood is much cooled, not only by the cold air which passes
over it, but also, and more especially, by evaporation ; and,
when the flat is again filled with hot wort, a great part of the
heat of that liquid is absorbed by the cold wood.

In all cases where metallic tubes filled with steam are used
