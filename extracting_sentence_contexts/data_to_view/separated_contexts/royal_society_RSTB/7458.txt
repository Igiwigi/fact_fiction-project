Many old pellets were found then (one
included a vole ring), but only four new pellets had been produced by February, none by
March, two by May and none thereafter during 1938-9. APPENDIX 2. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF DATA FROM MARKING AND RECAPTURE

The results of marking and retrapping cannot be interpreted without a careful use of
the facts in ยง 5 about the sampling procedure and characteristics of the animals. Results
on block E cannot be used because immigration and emigration may not have been
negligible, and old animals cannot be grouped with young because they had different
death-rates, both natural and induced. Hence the present analysis is restricted to the fate
of those young which were alive on block Q in August and September 1937 (table 12).
