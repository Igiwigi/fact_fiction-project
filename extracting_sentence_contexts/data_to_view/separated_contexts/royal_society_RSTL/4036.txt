conclusion, we must ever bear in mind the vast difference between natural and arti-
ficial mechanism, and however complicated a problem it may be to determine that
constitution of the yocal apparatus, by which the thyro-arytenoid ligaments may
simultaneously obey the laws of cords and tongues, yet to a physiologist who is ac-

* The formula of Grorpano Riccart is N=2D 28, where N is the number of vibrations, D the thick-

animal frame, the difficulty of finding a strictly mathematical solution is, in such a
case, no objection to its truth, when the facts, 80 far as they have been observed, are
decidedly favourable to its reality. Were the movements of the glottis independent of
any tube or column of air, the study of the functions of the vocal organs would be
much more simple, but we find it situated nearly in the centre of the vocal tube of
which the trachea and bronchi are the inferior, and the upper part of the larynx,
pharynx, nose and mouth, the superior porticn ; we have therefore to consider the
influence of this tube, and of its inclosed column of air in the production of voice. In order to investigate the mutual relations between a reed and a pipe, two methods
may be adopted : one of these is to vary the pitch of the reed while the length of
the pipe remains constant, and the other, to vary the length of the pipe with a reed
sounding one tone only, when detached from the tube.
