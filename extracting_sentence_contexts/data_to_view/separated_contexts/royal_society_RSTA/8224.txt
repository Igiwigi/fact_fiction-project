We have completed now the examination of all possible ®-surfaces, and we have
shown how to derive all the associated systems ® from certain associated systems of
curves A’ which we have obtained. This method carries with it a classification of all
the systems ® according to the type of their general ©-surface ; but it is not surprising
to find that such a classification, arising as it does from one particular method of genera-
tion of the systems ®, proves somewhat unsatisfactory from a more general point of view. In fact some of the transformations in the various classes are obviously limiting cases of
more general transformations in other classes. For example most of those ®-systems
in which the quadrics touch a plane along a given line are limiting cases of others in
which the quadrics all contain a given conic. We shall therefore have to bear the faults
of the classification in mind in deciding what transformations are the most general.
