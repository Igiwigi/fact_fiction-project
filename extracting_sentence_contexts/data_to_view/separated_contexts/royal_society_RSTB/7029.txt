With Cryptus a diet that is deficient in protein and has excess energy-producing
sugar induces the formation of eggs very few of which give rise to larvae which enter
diapause. Either of these effects would raise the level of physiological activity and metabolic
rate of the parent female. Senility, on the other hand, would be expected to slow down
physiological activity and decrease the metabolic rate of the female, and, in fact, oviposition
rate decreases with age. Correlated with this there is an increase in the proportion of the
eggs laid which produce progeny going into diapause. Certain apparently similar effects
have been shown by Schmieder (1933, 1939) but are seen on analysis to be due to different
