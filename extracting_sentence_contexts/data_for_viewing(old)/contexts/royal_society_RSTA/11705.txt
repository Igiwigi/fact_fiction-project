THE ELECTRIC AND LUMINIFEROUS MEDIUM. 209

On Material Models and Illustrations of the Aither and its associated
Electrons.

3. Although the GAussiAN aspect of the subject, which would simply assert that
the primary atoms of matter exert actions on each other which are transmitted in time
across space in accordance with MaXxweEL’s equations, is a formally sufficient basis
on which to construct physical theory, yet the question whether we can form a valid
conception of a medium which is the seat of this transmission is of fundamental
philosophical interest, quite independently of the fact that in default of the analogy
at any rate of such a medium this theory would be too difficult for development.
With a view to further assisting a judgment on this question, it is here proposed to
describe a process by which a dynamical model of this medium can be theoretically
built up out of ordinary matter,—not indeed a permanent model, but one which can
be made to continue to represent the «ther for any assignable finite time, though
it must ultimately decay. The ether is a perfect fluid endowed with rotational
elasticity ; so in the first place we have—and this is the most difficult part of our
undertaking—to construct a material model of a perfect fluid, which is a type of
medium nowhere existing in the material world. Its characteristics are continuity
of motion and absence of viscosity: on the other hand in an ordinary fluid,
continuity of motion is secured by diffusion of momentum by the moving molecules,
which is itself viscosity, so that it is only in motions such as vibrations and slight
