of the hammer falling in rapid succession upon different adjacent parts of the surface,
and partly to the lack of uniformity of support given by the other leaves above and
below in the packet. The view now stated receives confirmation from a point
strongly insisted upon by Mr. Hanna—the very intelligent superintendent of the

W. H. Kemp Company's workshops—namely, that for success in the gold-beating
process much depends on the condition of the animal membrane as to moisture or
dryness. If it be very dry the gold-leaf cracks or breaks, while if the membrane be
too moist the leaf sticks to it. ‘The membrane requires to be dried or dampened to
correct the opposite effects of change in the atmosphere. This accords with the idea
that a certain amount of elastic stretching of the membrane, from which this
recovers, is necessary for the permanent or inelastic extension of the gold. In fact,
as the area of the gold-leaf is permanently extended by the beating, while that of
the membrane is not, the one film manifestly must slide over the other. It is
scarcely conceivable that this sliding shall occur at the moment at which a blow
falls, when friction between the surfaces is at a maximum, If not, it must occur
just afterwards, as a result of the elastic resilience of the membrane, which leaves
behind it the plastie gold.

It is evident that the statements to be found in the books as to the actual thickness
of gold-leaf—based as they are upon weighing of measured areas—represent only
average thickness, and that, in view of the decidedly greater thickness of these
microscopic threads of gold running through the mass than of the intervening parts,
the thickness of these latter parts must be notably less than the average. The
