that when the stick-slips disappeared there was a corresponding reduction in the wear
between the surfaces. With the lower fatty acids extensive tearing was observed; a
photomicrograph of the track formed with propionic acid is shown in figure 3c. The

higher fatty acids, however, gave very little wear, and figure 3d shows a typical trace
obtained with caprylic acid as lubricant. A broad band (indicated by arrows) can be
seen marking the region over which the upper slider had passed. An occasional
scratch is visible within this band showing that some seizure of the surfaces had
occurred, but the wear is obviously much less than that shown for propionic acid.
(The comparatively great width of these tracks is due to the fact that a small flat was
initially present on the upper slider during these two runs.)

A marked corrosion of the surfaces occurred with the shortest fatty acids, but this
decreased in extent as the molecular weight increased. A little corrosion was observed
with caproic and heptylic acids and none at all with the acids of greater molecular
weight.

Primary alcohols

The friction of the homologous series of saturated primary alcohols was investigated.
It was found that, provided the lubricant was present on the surface in the liquid state,
the motion always proceeded by stick-slips, and there was no sign of any change-over
