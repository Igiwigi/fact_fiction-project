In this way a triangular structure is formed rather than a ring of muscle fibrils
(text-fig. 5, Â¢). In the metanauplius stages the coiled lumen in the distal cells develops considerably. It has apparently well-differentiated walls that are distinct from the surrounding cyto-
plasm, and, in fact, it may now be termed a distinct duct running through the two
distal cells. The cytoplasm of the latter has now become full of deeply staining rods
that radiate from a reservoir that has formed in between the nuclei of the two cells. This reservoir is thus almost completely surrounded by the coiled duct.
