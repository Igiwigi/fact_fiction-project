The known cases in which dynamical locality fails are: the free Klein—Gordon field with m= 0,
& =0 in dimensions n > 2, which may be traced to the rigid ¢ +> ¢ + const. gauge symmetry [21];
the free massless current in two dimensions allowing disconnected space-times [21]; and the
free Maxwell field in dimension n =4, in a ‘universal formulation’ [12]. The main difference
between the two Maxwell formulations is that the universal formulation allows for topological
electric and magnetic charges in spacetimes with non-trivial second de Rham cohomology,
whereas the reduced formulation does not. In fact, the topological charges also fail to satisfy the
injectivity property normally required of a locally covariant theory—this reflects their non-local
nature, of course (see [9,13] for more discussion of the injectivity issue in related models). The
emerging pattern is that dynamical locality can be expected to fail where a theory admits a broken
rigid gauge symmetry or has charges stabilized by topological or other constraints; otherwise, it
appears to be reasonable to expect dynamical locality to hold—it also seems that even trivial
‘interactions’ such as a mass or curvature coupling are sufficient to restore dynamical locality. With the exception of the example of the massless current in disconnected space-times, all known
failures of dynamical locality are related to the existence of elements that are invariant under
arbitrary relative Cauchy evolution; conceivably the treatment of the massless current might be
modified to restore dynamical locality.
