Figure 8. Characterization of the unicolour groups in the final silent state. The experimental and the model results are respectively plotted in black and red (the
model plots are slightly shifted to the right for better readability). Probability distribution function (PDF) of the size of the 3-groups in the final silent state are
shown for k= 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13. The vertical scale is adapted to focus on the probabilities to find a group of size strictly less than 11. Note that due to the
experimental noise in the positions of the subjects, a few groups of size 1 and 2 were experimentally found in some instances. The last panel on the bottom right
summarizes the results using a larger vertical scale to reveal the increase and the ultimate saturation of the fraction of groups of size 22/2 = 11.

logic puzzles (see https://en.wikipedia.org /wiki/Hat.puz-

therein) where a group is able to collectively find the solution
to a problem only after each individual is aware that the
others will share the same strategy as them.
