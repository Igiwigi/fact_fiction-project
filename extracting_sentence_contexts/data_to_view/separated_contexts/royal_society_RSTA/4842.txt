In turn, this requires that By) must be in the range
0.25-0.5B, which in turn gives nanoflare energies of a few 10*4 ergs. This has several important
consequences.

(1) Models relying on the reduced MHD approximation [61-63] cannot account for AR
heating as their fundamental assumption of By «Ba will be violated. In fact when
Dahlburg et al. [62] included equation (2.1), temperatures of order 1 MK were obtained.

(2) We noted in §4 that Ty needs to be of order 500-2000s rather than in excess of 104s to
account for the range of AR observations. Cargill [34] and Lopez Fuentes & Klimchuk [64]
have presented comparable but slightly different arguments as to how this can happen. If a stressed field relaxes by only a small amount, the Poynting flux into the loop is large,
due to its proportionality to By.
