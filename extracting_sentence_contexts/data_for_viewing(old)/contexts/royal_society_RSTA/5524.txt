— Autonomous decision capabilities, decision making, emergent meaning, complex
systems

— Self-replication capabilities, smart materials, cloning, instantiation

— Self-evolving capabilities, sentiment analyses, awareness recognition, intention recognition


With the two last items, self-replication and self-evolving capabilities seem to originate from
science fiction. Yet, they are now at the core of the creation of Al. Google Deepmind used self-
instantiation, e.g. embedded replication to learn and evolve, creating a Go master that was able
to defeat the world champion. Interestingly, and this goes to support the theses exposed, a few
masters rather than feeling superseded by the machine found that the machine intelligence was
different from their own and actually contributed to augmenting their intelligence by proposing
‘moves’ that increased their understanding of the game.

This is just an example but in general we, humans, are benefitting from a machine’s
augmentation. We will have better tools and with these very same tools augment ourselves.

These ‘mutualistic’ symbioses are finding and will find applications in most sectors, as
illustrated in figure 1:
