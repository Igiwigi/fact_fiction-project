Thus, if the outer layer
of a sphere increases in volume, the matter inside must be subjected to a tensile stress. The effect of overstrain on the density of metals is at present under investigation
at the Royal Aircraft Establishment. The work is not yet sufficiently complete for
detailed publication, but it may be mentioned here that the expected change in density
has been found, and that the results already obtained are such as to leave little room
for doubt that this change is in fact the cause of fatigue failure in metals. Thus, in
overstraining mild steel by means of a pure shearing stress, a decrease in average
density of as much as 0-25 per cent. has been observed. Some progress has also been made in the direction of estimating the internal stresses
set up as a result of the change in density, and it has been found that an average change
of the magnitude mentioned above could give rise to a hydrostatic tensile stress in the
cores of the crystals, of the order of 30,000 lbs. per sq. inch.
