In considering the bearing of the figures in table 4 on the question of the specificity
of histones, two types of this phenomenon must be distinguished: species specificity and
cell specificity. The former, when applied to homologous proteins, is a general pheno-
menon. It is exemplified in connexion with the basic proteins of cell nuclei by the pro-
tamins, salmine and clupeine, present respectively in the sperm heads of the salmon and
herring, and the histone present in the sperm heads of the cod. These three proteins are
clearly homologous proteins for they occur in the nuclei of similar cells and must therefore
possess identical functions. The two protamins resemble one another closely in composition
and were, in fact, at one time, thought to be identical. It is, however, now certain, as
will be shown on p. 592, that they possess different compositions despite the small differ-
ences between the analytical results recorded in table 5. That the homologous histone of
cod sperm is a different protein from the protamins has, owing to its marked difference
in chemical and physical properties, never been in doubt. Species specificity of the basic
proteins of cell nuclei is thus demonstrable in the sperm heads of these fishes, and there
can be little doubt that it extends to the histones of other cell nuclei. Nevertheless, if the
analyses for homologous histones in table 4 are compared, it is evident that they give
no indication of species specificity in this sense. As far as the analyses have extended, it
is impossible to distinguish between the histones from ox and salmon livers or between
those from lymphocytes (or thymocytes) from the ox, fowl and man. It would be similarly
impossible to distinguish between salmon and herring protamins on the basis of the small
differences in their arginine contents given in table 5 were it not that other differences
