Such is the general theory. But it is probable that it undergoes modifications in
each particular case; it certainly does 80 in the only case fully examined here, viz. that
of a quadric having four-pointic contact with U.

In fact, inasmuch as the equations, whereby the constants are ultimately determined,
are linear the s0lution is in eyery case unique. But four-pointic contact will subsist if we
consider the quadric to consist of the tangent plane taken twice; and as the solution is
unique, no other quadric can in general be drawn having four-pointic contact. Further,
since a tangent plane can in general be drawn at every point on U, the quadric of four-
pointic contact (viz. the tangent plane taken twice) exists generally ; and the condition
(viz, difference, conditions —constants=1) restricting it to a curye on U must be satisfied

identically. Similar remarks apply to contact of the degrees 6, 8, 10; but not appa-
rently to that of the degree 15.
