both women to admire the others separate but complementary achievements and abilities, can
be read as a lesson in self-presentation. Each emphasized what the other could do, insisting they
were envious of their prowess and inspired to study harder. Neither could be accused of ‘being
their own Trumpeter’, allowing Lalande to generously perform that task for them himself.

Caroline’s paper is an announcement of the existence of a previously unknown comet, so
simply within those terms it is as factually accurate today as it was when it was written. The
comet exists and had not been spotted before (unlike some of Caroline’s later comet discoveries).
Her paper makes no attempt to analyse the comet's orbit, or make predictions about its future
position or date of return. It does not consider the composition of the comet or where it originated.
While our knowledge of all these areas of comet study are much more developed now than when
Caroline wrote her paper, they go beyond what would reasonably have been expected at the time.

The field of comet studies has gone through several distinct phases since Caroline’s discovery.
The eighteenth century, in which all eight of Caroline’s comets were discovered, was a period
dominated by positional astronomy. Comets were identified and observed, their positions noted
and their orbits calculated. In 1705, Edmund Halley successfully predicted the return of the
comet that now bears his name using Isaac Newton’s new laws and historical records of comet
observations. As he suggested, the comet returned in 1758, showing that comets were part of
