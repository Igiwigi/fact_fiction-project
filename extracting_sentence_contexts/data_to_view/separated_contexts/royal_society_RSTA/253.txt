But we are dealing with a hugely complicated and nonlinear dynamical system,
and even three decades ago there were very significant uncertainties associated
with our quest for understanding. With computational power doubling every
eighteen months, things have greatly advanced since then, and the basic facts
are now unambiguous enough to be agreed (although there do remain significant
uncertainties about the speed of some processes—ice caps melting, or permafrost
thawing, or oceans becoming more acidic, and so on). The basic facts are now
clear enough that in 2005 the G8 science academies along with China, India
and Brazil asked that we ‘identify cost-effective steps that can be taken now
