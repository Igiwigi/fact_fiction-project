bijection from the edges of the original graph to the nodes of its line-graph.

Proof of proposition 4.1. We will show that there is an isomorphism g between (V",E") and
(V°,E°) as directed graphs without weights. Then we show ¢ preserves weights too. It is worth

noting at this point that, even if G were a multi-graph (i.e. with possibly more than one directed
edge from a node to another node), both G* and G* are merely graphs, and not multi-graphs (this
is a symptom of the fact that construction of both G" and G* involves taking a line-graph, and
not augmenting the set of edges after this action). So when showing our claimed isomorphism
is indeed an isomorphism we know there can be at most a single edge between any two nodes.

First, we find a bijection between E\B and V’, as follows. Upon aggregation of X in G the edges
that are eliminated are exactly the edges in X, that is, B. So there is a bijection A: E\B > Ex (A for
‘aggregation’). Upon taking the line-graph of Gx, we have a natural bijection (defined above)
L, : Ex — V", thus yielding the bijection g, = L; o A we sought.

Similarly, we construct a bijection between E\B and V°. Let L2(B) denote the collection of
nodes in G’ induced by edges B. There is a natural bijection Lz : E\B > V(G’)\L2(B). Then as
we eliminate exactly the set L7(B) of nodes in the line-graph to form G* there is trivially a
bijection E : V(G’)\L2(B) > V° (E for ‘elimination’) and thus we find a bijection g2 = E o Ly. Hence
