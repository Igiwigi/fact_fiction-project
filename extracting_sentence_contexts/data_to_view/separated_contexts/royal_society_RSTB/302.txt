Thus we see that whereas in combination with a lead-off from the mouth the only
unfavourable extremity is the right arm, this is the only favourable one in combination
with a lead-off from the rectum; likewise, any one of the three other extremities
constitutes a favourable combination with a lead-off from the mouth, and an unfavour-
able combination with a lead-off from the rectum. The reason is obvious: the mouth
is a point b, the rectum is a point a; the mouth and rectum series of combinations
with other points @ or b are consequently the counterparts of each other. The logical completeness of these experimental facts is further borne out by :â€”
