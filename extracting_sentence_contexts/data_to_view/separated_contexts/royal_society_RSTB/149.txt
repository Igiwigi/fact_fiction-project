134 DR, J. Y. MACKAY ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF

with branches of the dorsal carotid, and it is possible that, by virtue of this connec-
tion, the whole of the external branches of the dorsal vessel may have been
transferred to the ventral. In the Ground Hornbill (Bucorvus abyssinicus), where
the dorsal carotids are represented in the whole of their subvertebral course by solid
cords, the passage of blood to the head is maintained by an anastomotic vessel
occupying the position of the arteria collateralis colli of the Crocodile, which joins in
front one of the maxillary branches of the dorsal artery. In this case, therefore, by
a secondary change, shown to be so by the fact that the dorsal carotids are still
present as solid cords, the whole of the blood-supply of the head passes through the
neck by way of the ventral vessels—an arrangement similar to that which is expressed
in the explanation which RaTuxKs has put forward of the Mammalian development. Fig. 7.
