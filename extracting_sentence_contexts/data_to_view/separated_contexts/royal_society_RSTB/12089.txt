That
is the case for cardiomyocytes (CMs) which are the contract-
ing cells present in the myocardium and the main elements
responsible for cardiac activity [13]. When cultured in vitro, CMs can display a regular con-
tracting behaviour that is used as a relevant indicator
in toxicological studies. In fact, the mechanical and dynamic
properties of CMs are tightly connected. Contractility in CMs
is enabled by sarcomeres which are the supramolecular assem-
blies involving a combination of motor proteins such as myosin
with more structural/scaffolding proteins of which actin is a
notable example [14]. While sarcomeres primarily consist
o-actin molecules, most cells typically express f-actin, and to
a lesser extent also y-actin, that integrate the cytoskeleton
[15,16].
