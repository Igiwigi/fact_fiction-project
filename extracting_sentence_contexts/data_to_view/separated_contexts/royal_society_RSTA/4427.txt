By linking
together the data from the various experiments in the paradigm P with known and hypothesized
theory, the psychological scientist is able to draw conclusions about the subjects’ psychological
behaviour. P’s experimental outcome sets are pairwise disjoint. This is to reflect the fact that they appear
in different experiments. A main idea behind the treatments of paradigms presented in this
section is that experiments act like ‘contexts’, and thus are able to change the meaning of an
outcome to a subject by instructions, by other choices in its outcome set, etc. Of course, there are
situations where one wants to identify certain outcomes across experiments, and a mechanism
for doing this is presented later.
