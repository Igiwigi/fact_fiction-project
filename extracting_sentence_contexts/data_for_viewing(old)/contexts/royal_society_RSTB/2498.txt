difference from other Foxes, I examined him both with his brown summer coat and
in his white winter coat, but the appearance of the eye remained the same. It seems
as if animals with normal seasonal albinism have not the absence of pigmentation
which we find in true Albinos.

The domestic Dog, as in the case of all domestic animals, shows variations in every
individual ; but in no case have I found such an enormous differentiation in the
colour and the appearance of the fundus as in the Dogs, the difference being very
much more marked than in the domestic Cats or any of the domestic Ungulates.

I have examined a large number of different Dogs, and have come to the conclusion
that they will require a monograph to themselves. HArcKEL seems to be right in
deriving the domestic Dogs from the Wolves and Jackals. In fact, all the Dogs
which have come under my notice, with the sole exception of the Racoon-like Dog
(Canis procyonides), have the round pupils characteristic of the Wolves and Jackals in
distinction to the Foxes. The Chou-Chou Dog of the Chinese is remarkable in
having a brilliant orange-red fundus with a black peripheral zone covered with bluish
pigment patches, a fundus unlike any of the other Carnivora.

The fundus of the Cape Hunting Dog (Lycaon pictus) closely resembles that of the
Hyeenidee, and in this respect differs from all other Canide. FLower, in his work
on the Mammalia,* draws special attention to this resemblance on other grounds.
The Australian Dingo, on the other hand, seem to bear resemblance to the Wolves.
The Racoon-like Dog (C. procyonides) resembles both the Foxes and the Racoon in
having a vertically oval pupil, the fundus strikingly resembling that of the Racoon.
