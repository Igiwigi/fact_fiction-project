But, under conditions of culture, structural specialization (cilia, definite shape, etc.)
are lost, while their derivatives, as they grow around the implant, regain the properties
of mitotic division, movement of a sliding type, and the power of ingestion of foreign
bodies.

(v) Phagocytosis by Alveolar Epithelial Cells—With regard to the possibility of
phagocytosis by the alveolar epithelium i vivo, the question is still unsettled. That
the alveolar epithelium is phagocytic in vitro appears to me to be certain from these
experiments. But is it capable of ingesting foreign bodies (e.g., dust particles) in vivo ?
The presence, in cultures of adult lung, of both carmine particles—which had been
added to the culture—-and of minute carbon granules within cells obviously derived
from the alveolar epithelium suggests, at any rate, the possibility of phagocytosis
im vivo by these cells. And this view is strengthened by the fact that free carbon
granules could not be found in the control specimens of lung. But one fact stands
out: the alveolay epithelial cells in vitro are capable of swelling up and of detachment,
and, under the conditions of these experiments, were found to be actively phagocytic tor both
coal and carmine particles. The phenomenon often occurs on such a large scale that
it is difficult to suggest any other interpretation.

The controversy over the origin of the dust cells is beyond the scope of this paper,
