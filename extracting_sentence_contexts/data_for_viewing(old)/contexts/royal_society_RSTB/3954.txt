462 MR. W. E. AGAR: EXPERIMENTS ON INHERITANCE IN PARTHENOGENESIS.

The greatest opposition to modern views of genetics has come from those who
consider that they have taken away the philosophical basis of the theory of
evolution, and especially of the evolution of adaptation. For while mutation could
quickly bring about specific diversity, the evolution of complex adaptive structures
is undoubtedly most easily grasped when the inheritable variations presented to
natural selection are minute and abundant. This difficulty, though real, would
probably have assumed smaller proportions had it not been for the natural fact
that the earliest mutations studied were large morphological ones, and consequently
that these have become fixed in many minds as types of mutational change.
S. easpinosus shows us that very small mutations are more typical. The genetic
diversity in this species is expressed in the most minute external differences, so
that it is plain that the small differences required for adaptive evolution are there
in abundance, and the fittest biotypes could be isolated by selection. That
isolation once accomplished, however, further selection would have only non-
inheritable environmental modifications to work upon, and so would be powerless
until new genotypical differences were produced by mutation or crossing. These
differences apparently occur very rarely compared with the universality of
fluctuating variations, but this is to some extent compensated for by their constancy
