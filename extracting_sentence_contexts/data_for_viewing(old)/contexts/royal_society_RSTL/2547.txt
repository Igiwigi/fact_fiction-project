follow the sun's declination, owing to the interference of the monsoon.

My thermometrical observyations in Dukhun were made upon levels ranging from
1400 feet above the sea to 4500. At the latter height, however, they were very limit-
ed in number, and beyond the levels of 1600 and 2200 feet they may be considered
to have scarcely any sensible influence apon a mean temperature struck for tracts
traversed hetween 1900 and 2000 feet. For instance, the mean temperature of Ah-
mednuggur in 1828 (1900 feet), Dr. Waker determined to be 78* Fanr., and
my mean temperature for the country I traversed in that year was 77*-93. In 1827
it was 77'25 ; and in 1826, when my researches were a good deal confined to the
hilly tracts, the mean temperature was 7646; and in 1829 the mean temperature was
reduced to 74*8, three months' observations of the year having been taken at 3943
feet above the sea, and one month's observations at 2416 feet. One fact is very re-
markable; the observed mean temperature of places on the table land of India is
much higher than the calculated mean temperature of the same places agreeably to

Marer's formula. Ahmednuggur is 1900 feet above the sea with a mean temperature
of 78*: the calculated mean temperature is 72*27, Mhow in Malwa, at 2000 feet,
observed mean temperature 74* ; calculated 69*86. A spring in the hill fort of Hur-
reechundurghur I found to be 69*5 : the calculated mean temperature for the lati-
tude of that fort, at an elevation of 3900 feet, is 65*45. The calculated mean tempe-
rature of Poona is 72*78 ; the observed 777. But I purpose enlarging on this snh-
