From a gradually increased teinperature through the months of March and April,
the hive acquires its maximum amount, of temperature in the months of May and
June, the periods of the greatest activity, and when the largest proportion of young
bees is produced. Weare now aware of the circumstances connected with the great
amount of temperature in the hive at this season, and of the power which the
bees themselyes possess of increasing it at pleasure, or as the necessity for im parting
it to the young may demand. These facts will explain a circumstance connected
with the temperatare of the hive, which without a previous knowledge of them might
have been of difficult solation. It is the circumstance before alluded to of one part
of the hive being of a higher temperature than another. This is the case in the hive
even when the bees are not in a state of excitement.
