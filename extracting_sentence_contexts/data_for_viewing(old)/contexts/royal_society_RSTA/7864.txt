over the set 2 with centre of gravity_y and minimum “ real”? mass, on the one hand,
and distributions B of ordinary positive masses over the set x Cy with centre
» [Go] on the other. The correspondence being given by
da = 2— Me. ap.
— x — M,’

As corollary we have the explicit formula

N» (7) = Max Min 2— 4 for y « (M,,
x<m X—a
where a ranges through all complex numbers.

The proof follows at once from Theorems 15, 16, 13, 13’ and the fact that for a
circle © and_y « € the number Ng (7) is a function of the angle between the tangents
from _y to ©, which increases when this angle decreases.

Theorem 17’ represents the complete solution of the problem of the calculus of
variations corresponding to the definition of N*,, (7).

As corollary of Theorem 17 we have the following geometrical interpretation of
(My,

Theorem 17’’—If is bounded, (M)x, is the common part of all circles

which have the property that the circle
