elicit more activity than those perceived to continue through
the interrupting noise. This activity arises from AC and (in
humans) probably in the N1 latency range, and has been inter-
preted to reflect conscious perception of the silent gap present
in the stimulus of interest [106] or perceptual restoration of its
missing portion [79]. Involvement of other brain areas in per-
ceptual restoration remains to be identified (though see [162])
and likely depends on the nature of the stimuli used (e.g.
pure tones versus vowel stimuli, where the latter might be
expected to produce activity in speech-specific regions).

Finally, there exists an entire class of auditory illusions
and bistability phenomena related to the fact that pitch per-
ception has two dimensions—class and height—with the
class dimension being circular [163] (cf. §4d for further dis-
cussion of pitch) (see also [164]). These phenomena, many
of which have been well described by Deutsch [165], have
yet to be fully exploited or understood from a neural perspec-
tive [166] (but see [167-170]), and include infinitely rising/
falling pitches [163], the ‘tri-tone paradox’ (where successive


harmonic complex tones separated in pitch by six semi- visual integration and top-down control in AC on the superior | 9 |

tones—i.e. a tri-tone—can be perceived as either rising or temporal plane [191].
