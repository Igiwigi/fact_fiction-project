Such further dissections are figured in lower and upper views (Plate 39, figs. 1, 2),
with some of the investing bones, left for the most part in outline, to be useful as
landmarks.

The short, broad snout (al.n.) has its nostrils (e.n.) near the end, and rather under-
neath ; the 8nout narrows in front, broadens behind the nostrils, and then is some-
what pinched in,

From the middle of the floor, which erosses over the premaxillaries (pz.), the
recurrent, cartilages (70.c,) are given off, these grow round the opening of Jacops0N's
organs and then run along on their inner and under side as their proper, but imperfect,
capsule. These curious retral growths of the 8nont are twice as long in this species as
is normal, a fact the meaning of which I cannot explain, but which will be understood
when our knowledge of these parts is more advanced.

The inferior turbinals (7.th.) are very feeble, but the foremost coil of the middle
burbinal series (m.tb.) is very large indeedâ€”both in width and in length ; ib extends
forwards twice as far as usual : three other coils of this series are seen behind it.

Above (fig. 2), in this 8pecies, the olfactory labyrinth (al.e.) is seen to be short, and
nob very wide; this is partly due to age, and is partly a specifie distinetion. The
whole face being shorter and hroader in this embryo than can be accounted for by

difference of age ; the thick top of the septum (p.e.) does not end in a definite crista
galli. The top of the great septum (p.e.) is very oblique, it is narrow, and has a
