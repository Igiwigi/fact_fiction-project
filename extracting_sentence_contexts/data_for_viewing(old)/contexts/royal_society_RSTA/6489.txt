considering non-independence as a flux of information or a flux of energy, and that we are free to layer an informational
interpretation on top of an energetic distribution. Here see Granger [54].

1°}t was Benjamin D. Zablocki who brought this issue to my attention.


‘field’ in these two senses (that of classic field theory and that of a Markov Random Field), it might
help to imagine the sorts of interaction rituals that Collins discusses as specific social groups that
are technically cliques, and that the total social energy of some social order can be partitioned into
that associated with such different cliques in a Gibbs distribution that is correlative to a Markov
Random Field. Such an outrageously abstract claim might seem worse than useless, if it only
gives us the sense that we have precision where in fact we are completely at sea. But it might also
suggest the key issue for social research: to find something that in analogous to the ‘displacement
currents’ that Maxwell deduced—ways that a slightly compressible fluid might hold energy, even
if it involved electric currents existing in empty space. It might be that the equivalence between
energy and information could allow us to, vaguely and impressionistically at first, hopefully more
precisely with time, understand how human action shapes these sorts of configurations.
