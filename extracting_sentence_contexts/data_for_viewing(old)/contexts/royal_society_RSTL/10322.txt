amall vacuoles, or no vacuoles at all, than with large full-grown cells when large
vacuoles are present.

In the latter case there is every opportunity for contraction, and there is moreover
always a tendency to a dilution of the fixing fluid by the cell-sap. This being the
case, any 8uccessful results with full-grown cells may be regarded as very favourable
evidence for the efficacy of the reagent employed. In order to eliminate any doubt
as to whether the salt solution influenced the result, analogous experiments were made
with fresh tissue. The great drawback to the thorough efficiency of picric acid is that
it wets the tissue with some difficulty and ouly penetrates after zome time. This fact
becomes very apparent when large pieces of tissue are used at any time of difficult
permeability attendant on peculiar histological structure. A saturated s0lution of
picric acid in absolute alcohol to some extenb obviates this difficulty, but it is not
80 8uccessful as a saturated watery solution, although it appears to be a valuable
reagent for ordinary work.

With regard to other manipulative details, it is, as mentioned above, important to
cut up the material into 8mall pieces, and also to place it at once upon cutting in the
preservative medium. My usual plan, in fact, was to cub off the pulvini and allow
them to drop, then and there, into picric acid, in order to avoid any loss of water due to
evaporation, which as far as delicate investigations are concerned will s00n very gravely
affect the whole cell-equilibrium. After treatment with picric acid for about 24 hours
