very slight step from Zamia to the method of fertilization in all Conifers hitherto
described (except Gingko), where fertilization is completely siphonogamic, the pollen
tube making its way through the neck of the archegonium and carrying the
generative cells directly to the oosphere. Taking this into consideration, and also
the fact that the fertilization of Conifers has been worked out in detail in such a
small number of cases, it is quite possible that antherozoids will be discovered in a
number of other forms. Even if Gingko remains the only representative of the
group, with actually motile antherozoids, it seems not improbable—unless we are to
suppose that disappearance of cilia has taken place co-temporaneously with the attain-
