The equations are applicable only when the changes are reversible ; they are
invalid when there are hysteresis effects. This limitation, however, is unimportant
for the present purpose. The main difficulty arises from the fact that what is
required is the change in internal energy associated with a change in the intrinsic
magnetization ; the actual observed magnetization is the apparent magnetization. It is in this connexion that the study of the magneto-caloric effect is of value. The
value of (@E/Ã©c), associated with a change in direction, without change of magnitude,
of the intrinsic magnetization in limited domains is, in general, negligible compared
with that due to a change in magnitude of the intrinsic magnetization.
