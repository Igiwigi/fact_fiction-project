The charging due to the primary :
ion beam is essential for particle fragmentation. Ensuing positive TOF-SIMS mode matrix scans [=
did not visibly alter either particle morphology any further. This might be due to the fact that the :3
particles have been already fragmented during the prior negative mode TOF-SIMS matrix scans :
and no further fragmentation could be caused by the ensuing positive TOF-SIMS mode matrix DB
scans with the same primary ion beam settings. :

The short negative TOF-SIMS mode sequential spectra on particle Lou revealed that the first 14
visible alteration of the particle required between 3516 and 14069 primary ion beam shots or ae
the charge collected by the time of fracture being about 75-300 uC m~?, based on a 7nAcm~? [ae
primary ion beam current. After 250 000 shots a significant fragmentation is observed. The particle ee
fragmentation has occurred next to the tip of the particle.
