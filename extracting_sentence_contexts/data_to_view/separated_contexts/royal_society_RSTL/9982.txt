STRUCTURE AND DEVELOPMENT OF LEPIDOSTEUS. 407

1 examination of the ventral part of the caudal fin in various Ganoids, Teleostei,
Flasmobranehii appears to us to show that there can be but little doubt that, in
majority of the members of these groups at any rate, and we believe in all, the
a6 distinction between the ventral lobe of the caudal fin and the remaining unpaired
s is found as in Lepidosteus. Tn the case of most Elasmobranchii, a simple inspection of the caudal fin suffices to
ve this, and the anatomical features involved in this fact have usually been recog-
4; though, in the absence of embryological evidence, the legitimate conclusion has
; always been drawn from them.
ie difference between the ventral lobe of the caudal fin and the other fins in the
zode in which the fin-rays are supported is as obvious in Chondrostean Ganoids as it
in Elasmobranchii ; it would appear also to hold good for Amia. Polypterus we
ve had no opportunity of examining, but if, as there is no reason to doubt, the figure
F its 8keleton given by AGass1z (* Poissons Fossiles*) is correct, there can be no ques-
5n that the ventral lobe of the caudal fin is supported by the hazmal arches, and not
y interspinous bones. In Catamorethys, the tail of which we have had an opportunity
f dissecting through the kindness of Professor PARKER, the fin-rays of the ventral
Z lobe of the true caudal fin are undoubtedly supported by true hemal arches.
2 There is no unanimity of opinion as to the nature of the elements supporting the
'>Slin-rays of the caudal fin of Teleostei.
2 HuxLiey,* in his paper on the development of the caudal fin of the Stickleback,
= holds that these elements are of the nature of interhzmal bones.
