experiment proves that the latter is the true one.

If the clamp be placed in the auriculo-ventricular groove and be tightened 80 as
just to hold the tissue firmly, then both auricles and ventricle continue to beat with
perfect regularity for hours, each ventricular beat following in orderly 8equence upon
each auricular. In order to heat the parts of the heart on one side of the clamp
without heating those on the other side I have used a spiral of thin platinum or
copper wire which is placed round either the ventricle or the auricles and sinus and
is in connexion by means of a key with a battery of two or three Grove cells. When
the ventricle alone is to be heated it is placed in connexion with the upper lever and
the auricles with the lower ; if the heating is intended to affect only the sinus and
auricles then the arrangement is reversed. That this method works well is shown by
the fact that whereas a thermometer suspended within the spiral may show a rise up to
50* or 60? C. under the heating influence of three Grove cells, yeb a thermometer
placed againsb the tissue just below the clamp does not show any rise ab all, when the
spiral is in position round that part of the heart which is sitnated above the clamp.

Heating the sinus and anricles alone in this way causes a most marked increase in
the rate of rhythm both of the auricles and ventricle, with other phenomena which
will be mentioned presently (Plate 67, fig. 1}, showing that the method of heating is
effective. On the other hand, when the ventricle alone is heated no alteration in the
