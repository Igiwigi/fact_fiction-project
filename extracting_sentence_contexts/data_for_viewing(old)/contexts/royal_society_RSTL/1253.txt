The first idea of the apparatus which I contrived for raising
water from the bottom of the sea, occurred to me about ten
years ago, on accidentally seeing in an instrument maker's
shop, a machine, said to be the identical one which was used
for a similar purpose by Dr. Irvins, in Captain Paiees's
(since Lord MuLcRave) expedition. This consisted simply
in a cylindrical vessel having an opening at the top, and a si-
milar one at the bottom, each closed by a flap or valve opening
only upwards, and moving freely upon hinges. When this

sea water was less salt between the tropics than between the coasts of Spain and Tene-
riffe ; and his obseryations seem to lead to the inference, that there is a specific gravity
peculiar to the water of each zone; a conjecture, however, which the facts collected in
this paper do not appear to confirm,

* It may perbaps be worth while to mention a small improvement which was intro-
duced in the vessel used for weighing the waters. The apparatus consisted in a thin
phial, nearly spherical, containing between five and six hundred grains of distilled
water, and having a very light ground glass stopper. But as I had obseryed on former
occasions that such phials were apt to burst on the stopper being forced in, from the
compression of the liquid with which they were filled, I had the stopper made with a
very small longitudinal aperture through it, $0 as to allow a minute quantity of water
to ooze out; and this was very easily accomplished (by Mr. Newnan, of Lisle-street)
by forming the stopper of a portion of thermometer tube, the bore of which perfectly
answered the desired purpose. 7
