The presence of the X° strain of the virus has a slight dwarfing effect on the plant,
greater than that exerted by the X” strain, but far less than that induced by infections
with X4, XS or X.

In Datura. There are no local lesions. A very faint systemic mottle appears on the
younger leaves between the eighth and eleventh day, disposed in small areas as in
tobacco, and demarcated by the more pronounced green banding of the smaller veins
(fig. 5, Plate 18). Under favourable conditions this may be preceded by a brightening
of the finer veins ; such may be seen towards the base of the leaf in fig. 5. When this
strain of the virus is more or less invisible on tobacco, it is always possible to obtain
some reaction on Datura. Under glasshouse conditions this reaction may become very
faint, yet it has always proved adequate for the distinction between X° and X”, even
with aged plants, a fact which makes Datura in this respect a more serviceable test plant
than Nicotiana tabacum. Infection with the X¢ strain virus has only a slight inhibitory
effect on the growth of the plant.

In potatoes. The X®% strain does not readily pass by inoculation to the potato, but
such results as have been obtained are the same as those induced by grafting. Thus in
Arran Victory there usually occurs a very faint interveinal mottle which does not
always show in the young top growth. In other cases no symptoms develop, though
the presence of the virus can be demonstrated by inoculation back to Datura. In
