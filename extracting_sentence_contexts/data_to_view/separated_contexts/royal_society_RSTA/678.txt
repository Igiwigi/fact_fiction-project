Previous studies have demonstrated the
potential value of engaging citizen scientists in quantitative meteorological research, for example,
the UK Citizen Rainfall Network [8] and the Royal Meteorological Societies Big Urban Heat
Island project [9]. Temperature changes associated with urban heat islands are approximately
several kelvin [10], which is similar to eclipse-driven temperature changes. Therefore, the fact that
urban heat island temperature changes have been detected by a citizen science project [9] gives
us confidence that a similar approach can be used to detect eclipse-driven temperature changes. In ยง2, we describe the objectives, design and development of NEWEx. Section 3 describes
the data processing.
