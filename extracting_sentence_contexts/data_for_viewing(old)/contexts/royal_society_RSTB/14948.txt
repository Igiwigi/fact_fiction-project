(a) Sociability in the invasion context.

Sociability between non-native and native species occurs and In some cases, the aggregation process is reinforcing,
can be beneficial for non-natives, at least during some stages meaning large groups attract more individuals. We expect

non-native species and natives could lead the former to
advantages such as predator avoidance and improved fora-

where these associations might benefit invaders in their
reproduction. To test this, individual reproduction success
(e.g. copulations, number of offspring, etc.) could be com-
