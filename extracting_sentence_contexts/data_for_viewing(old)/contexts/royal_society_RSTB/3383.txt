animals (rabbit, guinea-pig, and mouse) over a very wide range of weight within
each species, a point appears to be reached when the individuals are very young and
light, where a slight periodical deviation commences, in exactly the same way as is
the case if the surface of the same individuals be calculated from the body weight
according to Mrnn’s formula (S = /W').

This deviation is in both cases due to the fact that the power is slightly too small.
If it be taken a little larger, the small periodic deviation disappears both from
Meren’s formula and from our own,
