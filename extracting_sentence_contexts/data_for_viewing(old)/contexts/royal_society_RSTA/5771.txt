building a bridge between dynamical systems, chaos and topology? Knots being one of the
components of helicity, together with twist and writhe, what is then the role of helicity (kinetic,
magnetic, cross, generalized) in the dynamics of fluid and (Hall)-MHD turbulence?

The first discussions of helical structures in turbulent flows were likely made in the context
of magnetic fields, which are ubiquitous in the universe; they are also often found to be
strong when compared with typical velocities, such as for example in the galaxy. This would
create an imbalance in the evolution equation—in the simplest case, the magnetohydrodynamic
formulation, were it not for the fact that the Lorentz force exerted by such fields can be rendered
weak through alignment of the magnetic induction and the current density. Such force-free
fields were thus postulated to exist many years ago, although their origin remained somewhat
mysterious. This led Woltjer [3] (see also [4]) to realize that magnetic helicity Hjy (definitions and
equations are given in §2) was an invariant of the MHD equations in the absence of forcing and
of dissipation, as was the cross helicity (or cross-correlation Hc) between the magnetic field and
the velocity.

It was only some years later that a similar conservation law was unraveled in the fluid case : =
for the kinetic helicity Hy [5-7]. Helicity corresponds to topological properties of the flows and : =
fields, through knots, links, twists and writhes [6,8,9], and their entanglement. Helicity is a pseudo :3
(axial) scalar, since it can change sign upon change of a reference frame from right-handed to left- : =
handed. This corresponds to the (similar) fact that, in a Serret—Frenet frame describing a string in 2k
