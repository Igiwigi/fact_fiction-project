40 w), human hair (diameter 70 yu), llama hair (diameter 110 ), hedgehog spine (dia-
meter 1 mm.), and porcupine quill (diameter 2 to 5 mm.). The Geelong, Australian,
and Cotswold wools, and also the human hair, were taken from the actual specimens
used by SpeaKMAN in his comprehensive researches on the load/extension curves of
these fibres, so that in what follows there can be no doubt as to the legitimacy of any
comparisons which may be drawn between X-ray effects and accompanying elastic
behaviour.

The photographs show that without doubt a considerable proportion of the structure
of hair* is crystalline or pseudo-crystalline, and that this constituent is common to all
the fibres examined, in the sense that substantially the same X-ray photograph is
always obtained, from the finest Merino wool to such large-scale structures as quills.
In fact, the interference figures given by human hair and the tip-end of a porcupine
quill, respectively, are practically indistinguishable. Presumably, we are dealing with
a photograph of crystalline keratin, or of one of the forms of keratin, if indeed there is
more than one fundamental keratin. It is immediately noteworthy that the dimensions
of the photograph are not such as would be expected from a substance of very high
molecular weight, of the order usually associated with proteins ; rather are we reminded
of the case of cellulose, in which it seems clear that a comparatively simple unit may be
repeated, ‘* via” primary valency bonds, an indefinite number of times.

The second important result of the present investigation has been to show that the
X-ray photograph of unstretched hair is quite different from that of stretched hair.
On stretching the hair, the «-photograph, as we shall call it, fades away and is gradually
replaced by the $-photograph, the interferences of which first become prominent at
