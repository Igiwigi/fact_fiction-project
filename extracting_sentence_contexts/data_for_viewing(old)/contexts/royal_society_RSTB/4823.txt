magna, but he satisfied himself that it was not, and that it did in reality end blindly,
forming an offshoot or kind of coiled reservoir attached to the stem of the anterior
carotid, and thus, it would seem, presenting a structure of a kind hitherto unknown in
the vascular system.

The posterior carotid shows little modification from the normal, except for the

development upon its orbital branch of a small convoluted tangle, and for the fact that
it, and not the anterior carotid, gives origin to the A. ophthalmica magna.

A further stage in the elaboration of the carotid circulation is presented by the Blue
Shark (Carcharias glaucus).

As previously mentioned, MiLLER and VircHow (17, 26) briefly notice the condition
of the carotids in this species and point out that the anterior carotid is greatly increased
in length and coiled together within the orbit.

From the dissection of two specimens of this fish (one a fragment, the other an
individual five feet in length) Iam able to confirm the above statement and add further
details (fig. 6).
