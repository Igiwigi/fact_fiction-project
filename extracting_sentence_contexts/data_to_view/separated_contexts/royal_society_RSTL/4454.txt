A further confirmation of this view is found in the decomposition by
water of the remarkable bodies discovered by FRrankLanDy, to which he has given
the names of zinc-methyl and zinc-ethyl. The theoretical analogy of these bodies to
the hydrogen compounds of the metal is perfect, and with water they give a precisely
similar reaction to that of the hydruret of copper with hydrochloric acid. Zinc-ethy],
for example, breaks up thus—

in which decomposition the hydrogen and the hydrocarbon (which is the analogue of

the change as the two equivalents of the hydrogen itself in the decompoxition of the
hydruret.

3, When a solution of bichromate of potash is poured into a strong and acid solu-
tion of the peroxide of barium in hydrochloric or nitric acid, a violent effervescence
and escape of oxygen takes place ; apart, these s0lutions are perfectly stable ; bring
them together, they are both decomposed ; the chromic acid passes into chloride of
chrome, the peroxide of hydrogen into water, and the oxygen formed is due to the
8imultaneous decomposition of both bodies, thus—
