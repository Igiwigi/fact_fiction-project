The clip was fixed on the foot when the animal's attention
was attracted away, for if it saw what was done, it would remove the clip from the
paralyzed side, although, generally speaking, it would not do so until some time had
elapsed ; and I was led to believe from this test that it did not feel so well on the
paralyzed side as on the healthy side. To make sure of the validity of this test the animals were anesthetized with ether,
and a clip fixed on each foot; when they came to they invariably removed the clip
from the non-paralyzed side, leaving the other hanging on. Another peculiar fact noticed in connection with this test was that, when the clip
was fixed on the paralyzed foot, the animal would draw up the sound one, examine
it and scratch it several times, then give it up. Tn one case this phenomenon was noticed under the following circumstances. The
animal having been anesthetized, a clip was fixed on the paralyzed footâ€”when it
recovered consciousness it lifted up the non-paralyzed foot, scratched and examined
the same part as that to which the clip was fixed on the other foot.
