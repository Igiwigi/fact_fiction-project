Reflecting on this, Kidston &
Lang [59] and later Bower [33] concluded that the absence of
evidence of gametophytes implied that they must have been
even simpler and less robust than the sporophytes. Others dis-
agreed. One influential alternative interpretation held that the
rhizomes were in fact gametophytes from which upright
aerial sporophytes developed [60]; however, key evidence for
the gametophytic status was disputed [61,62]. Although this
interpretation did not receive universal acceptance, it drew
attention to the possibility that the two phases of the life
cycle might have strongly resembled one another.
