In another and deeper part of the pit, the workmen on the same day turned out,
amongst the dug gravel, two more perfect specimens of flint-implements, from depths
respectively of 20 and 24 feet beneath the original surface. Portions of the white calca-
reous matrix still adhered to these implements, and they were partly stained ochreous,
like one portion of the gravel with which they were in contact. This part of the pit was,
like the other, perfectly undisturbed. The bed of sand over the gravel was, however,
more deyeloped and more argillaceous, and IT found in it, immediately above the place
where the flints were lying, many perfect specimens of the fragile Limneus, Succinea,
Planorbis, and Helix. The workmen brought us some ten or twelve more flint-imple-
ments recently discovered. They all affirmed these flints to be found low down in the
gravel and in unbroken ground (terrain vierge). When the pits are in full work, a day
rarely passes without some of these objects being met with. The number is in fact one

* This implement is rougher and more imperfect than the generality of the specimens; till it exhibits

evident traces of working, especially on one side and at the point. It is an unfinished implement,
resembling in that respect 8everal T have since seen.

+ Now commonly known to them by the name of * Haches.” The children sometimes call them *Langues
de Chat.” IT may observe that our visit, both at Abbeville and Amiens, was entirely unforeseen and unex-
pected, and very little yalue was then placed on either flint-implements or fossils.
