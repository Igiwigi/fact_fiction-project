DIFFRACTION FROM AN IRREGULAR SCREEN 589

with 7. We deduce that, in order to experience an important change in P(s) we must alter
§ by an amount sufficient to introduce, into the path difference between the ends of the slit,
an extra length of about half a wave-length. But this is also the change in s required to take
us from a maximum to a minimum in the diffraction pattern produced by the optical stop
itself when it is illuminated uniformly. We therefore conclude that when s is varied the
change in P(s) is related to the angular diffraction pattern of the optical stop which bounds
the original diffracting screen. In fact, we do not expect P(s) to change much until we have
moved through an angle equal to that which separates a maximum from the neighbouring
minimum in the angular spectrum of the stop.

We shall now deduce this same result more rigorously, and it will be convenient,
at the same time, to make the discussion more general. Up to now we have assumed
that the series of screens, in whose properties we are interested, are all illuminated by
a uniform beam of radiation limited by a straight-sided ‘stop’, so that the ‘system average’
of the intensity over the screens, given by | £,(x, 0) |?, is constant within the region of the
stop and zero outside. We now consider the general case where | E,(x, 0) |? is a known
function of any form. Since the averaging over systems has removed the random nature of
the screens the remaining variation, represented by | E,(x, 0) |*, is due either to a property
common to all the screens, or to a variation of the incident radiation across the screens.
