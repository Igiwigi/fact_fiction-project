a fact, however, which may be due to the amalgam not being really a compound of ammonium.



376 ON THE UNION OF AMMONIA NITRATE WITH AMMONIA /

When the positive electrode is formed of platinum, or iron, it is unacted upon during
the electrolysis; but when it is formed of 8#lver, mercury, lead, copper, zinc, or mag-
nesium, it is corroded, and no nitrogen is evolved. The silver, lead, and copper elec-
trodes readily dissolve as nitrates, the copper one s00n becoming coated with an azure-
blue deposit. Mercury dissolves only slightly, but its surface becomes covered with a
grey deposit. Zine and magnesium dissolve as nitrates, but somewhat more slowly
than the other metals mentioned, a fact probably to be accounted for by their tendency
to direct or local action upon the nitrate. , |
