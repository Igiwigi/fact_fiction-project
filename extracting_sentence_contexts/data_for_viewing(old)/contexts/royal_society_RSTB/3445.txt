macrospore itself occurs among the undifferentiated tissue of the apex. A bi-nucleate
sac is shown in fig. 1A. The more advanced stages are found at depths below the
apex more or less proportional to their ages. The oldest seen is represented in
fig. Le; save for its elongated form it is quite similar to the corresponding stage
in the ovule. It is hardly possible that a sae in such a position can ever be
functional.

The occurrence of macrospores and their germination among the sterile tissue of
the cone-axis is not the least puzzling of the many remarkable features presented by
the life-history of Welwitschia. The morphological nature of the ovule in general
is still in doubt and the evidence bearing upon the question inadequate and
conflicting.* The view, formerly prevalent, that it belongs to the category of the
caulome, is in fact a bud, has fallen into disrepute, and authorities are now for
the most part divided in supporting two alternate hypotheses, the one that the
ovule with its integuments is a structure swi generis, and the other that, whatever
its position, it is part of the sporophyll, .e. foliolar. For Welwitschia there is no
escape from the conclusion that it is a bud. It is impossible to suppose that in a
member of so highly organised a group as the Spermaphyta, spores can be produced
indifferently in the ovule and in a vegetative axis. Therefore the cone whose axis
contains spores can only be a modified ovule; the axis, a nucellus which has
undergone a process akin to proliferation. The nucellus is therefore an axial
structure and the ovule with its integuments is a bud. Its axial position and the
acropetal order in which its envelopes appear are in accord with this view, which has
been adopted by most authors for each of the three genera of the Gnetales.t
