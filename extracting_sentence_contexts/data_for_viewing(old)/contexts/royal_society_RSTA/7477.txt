It should be noticed that in going from the preliminary experimental conditions in which
fields of only 9500 G were available, to the better set-up with fields up to 15800G, several
metals (antimony, cadmium, indium, mercury, thallium) which appeared at first to give
negative results have proved to have in fact a quite marked de Haas-van Alphen effect.
From a purely empirical point of view this suggests that a further increase of field to, say,
30000 G might well show up the effect in some of the metals listed in table 10 as giving
negative results. According to the theory for an ideally free electron gas, an effect should
show up appreciably only at very much higher fields, of the order of 100000G, and the
period would then be of the order of 50 G, so very special experimental conditions would

be necessary to observe it. Since we should expect that this ‘ideal’ theory would apply at
least qualitatively to metals such as copper, in which the Fermi surface does not cross any
Brillouin zone boundaries, it would in fact be surprising from a theoretical point of view
