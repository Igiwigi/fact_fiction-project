The intersection of two consecutive tangent planes is a line meeting
the two curves, which line is the generating line of the Torse, and snch Torse is there-
fore the Torse (m, 3) in question. The foregoing investigation is not, very satisfactory, but I confirm it by considering
the case of two plane curves, orders 2 and 7, and classes p and y, respectively. The
tangents of the two curves can, it is clear, only meet on the line of intersection of the
planes of the curyes; and the construction of the Torse is in fact as follows: from any
point of the line of intersection draw a tangent to mz and a tangent to 72, then the line
Joining the points of contact of these tangents is a generating line of the Torse. The
order of the Torse is equal to the number of generating lines which meet an arbitrary
line; and taking for the arbitrary line the line of intersection of the two planes, it is
easy to see that the only generating lines which meet the line of intersection are those
for which one of the points of contact lies on the line of intersection ; that is, they are
