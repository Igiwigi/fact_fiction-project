The first thing to note is that, if £ in (5.1) is a non-local operator, then it is not unique
because, if o* and p* satisfy

divo*—sp*=0, xEQ (5.2)
and n-o*=0 on 0, then

| loge + ppv) dx=0 (6.3)
2

for all (e, v) derived from a displacement field u and hence

L Hl =(L+L") Hl , (5.4)

where the non-local operator £* has kernel

o*(x)
p(x)

If £* is not even required to be symmetric, then different row and column vectors could be used in
its definition. One way to define £ uniquely is to require that it would apply even in the presence
of a possibly incompatible ‘transformation strain’ 7 so that, in the presence of such transformation
strain, stress and total strain are related by

r=e("") (5.6)
Uv

It is possible to include such a transformation strain in the Hashin-Shtrikman formulation,
taking 7 to be sure. The estimate for £° survives, showing that it does in fact comply with this
uniqueness restriction. Willis [33] developed a more flexible definition for effective properties than that employed
so far, by introducing a weighting function w(x,a), normalized so that (w) =1, and defined a

LY(x,2!) = [o*(@’) p*@’))- (6.5)


weighted mean displacement
(u) w = (wu) (5.7)

and associated weighted mean velocity (v)w=s(u)w or (0/dt)(u)w and strain (e)w with ij
component ((e)w)ij = 31(u)w)i, + ((u)w);,i)- The new proposed effective relation was

(0) | _ pete | (bw
] =f lee 68)

No new average was introduced for o or p because it is important that the equation of motion
should still hold exactly. However, the body-force f in any realization was changed to w(x, @)f(x) =
w(x, a)(f)(x).
