where p, q, 7.. are any positive integers, the function 80 obtained is a covariant in-
volving the sets (z;, y:..), (24, Y2-.) &C.; and if after the differentiations we replace

these sets by the original et (x, y..), we have a covariant involving only the original

set (x, y..) and of course the coefficients of the quantic. It is in fact easy to show
that any such derivative is a covariant according to the definition given in this Me-
moir. But to do this some preliminary explanations are necessary.

11. I consider any two operations P, Q, involving each or either of them differen-
tiations in respect of variables contained in the other of them. It is required to
investigate the effect of the operation P.Q, where the operation Q is to be in the first
place performed upon some operand £Q, and the operation P is then to be performed
on the operand QN. Suppose that P involves the differentiations 9,, d,.. in respect
of variables a, b.. contained in Q and Q, we must as usual in the operation P replace
D,, 0,,.. by 9,+0,, 0,+0,, .. where the unaccentuated symbols operate only upon (2,
and the accentuated symbols operate only upon Q. Suppose that P is expanded in
ascending powers of the symbols ®/, d;.., viz. in the form P+P, +P,+ &c., we bave
