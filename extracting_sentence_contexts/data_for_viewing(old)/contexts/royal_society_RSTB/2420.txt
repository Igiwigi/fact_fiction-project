Hypoderris.

The genera Hypoderris and Woodsia have, on account of the basal indusium, and
rounded superficial sorus, been placed by Sir Witt1AM Hooker in the Dicksoniez,
sharing that position on the one hand with Onoclea, and on the other with Sphero-
pteris. We shall see that in an important character they differ from all the true
Cyathew, and from Eu-dicksonia.

Curist has placed Hypoderris and Woodsia together with Onoclea and Diacalpe
in the Aspidiaceze. This appears to be done chiefly on grounds of external habit,
quite irrespective of the internal arrangements of the sorus, and notwithstanding the
fact that the indusium is basal in the former, while it arises from the tip of the
receptacle in the latter.

Observations were made on the sorus of Hypoderris Brownii, J. Sm., and first it
may be noted that the outline of the sorus shows some variety, numerous cases of
fission being found. There is a thin basal indusium, and sporangia of various ages
are mixed together with no apparent order of succession, though the majority of the
young sporangia originate towards the centre. There is no regularity of orientation
of the sporangia ; they have long stalks, and after dehiscence the heads fall away,
while the stalks remain, forming a protection for those younger sporangia which
appear later. The receptacle is only very slightly convex, and does not become
elongated as in most Ferns with basipetal sori. The sporangia are slightly unequal
on the two sides, but the annulus is vertical, and stops short at the stalk, as in most
