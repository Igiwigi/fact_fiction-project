Table 1 summarizes these hypotheses and several
associated predictions. Paternity uncertainty represents the oldest and most
common explanation of matrilineal inheritance and coopera-
tive behaviour. Alexander [91] was the first evolutionary
anthropologist to describe what is, in fact, ‘one of the oldest
hypotheses in social science’ [71] in evolutionary terms. The
adage, ‘Mommy’s baby; Daddy’s, maybe’ captures the
source of a fundamental difference between male and
female reproduction in mammals: for mammalian females,
genetic parentage is virtually assured, whereas there is
nearly always room to doubt a male’s parentage. The pater-
nity uncertainty hypothesis posits that, if a male’s
parentage is very insecure, he may do better in terms of
inclusive fitness to invest in his sororal nieces and nephews,
to whom genetic relatedness is relatively secure [8,79,81—
84,91].
