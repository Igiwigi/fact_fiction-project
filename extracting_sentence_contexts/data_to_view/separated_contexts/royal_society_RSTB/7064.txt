This same difference is brought
about in the early stages of development of Spalangia eggs by the formation of the ova
within the ovarioles at different temperatures. Subsequent to laying all these eggs are
subject to the same environmental conditions. However, those eggs which have thus
started development with an increased metabolic rate proceed with growth at a somewhat
higher rate, a fact shown by the shorter developmental time of those individuals belonging
to this category that emerge without passing through a stage of diapause. Correlated with
this, fewer of this latter type of egg produce individuals going into diapause. To envisage this effect clearly we must consider the development of the insect from the
formation of the egg to the full-grown larval stage (where diapause may occur in these two
species) and even beyond.
