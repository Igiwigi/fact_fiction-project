When Pope Gregory XIII. reformed. the Julian
Solar Year, he likewiſe made a Correction as to the
ZTime of celebrating the Feaſt of Eaſter, by placing
=the Epacts (which he dirccted-to be made uſe of
Efor the future inſtead of the Golden Numbers), much
Enearer to the true Times of the New Moons than
=the Golden Numbers then ſtood in the old Calendar:
SI ſay, much nearer to the true Times; becauſe in
=fact the Epacts, as placed by him, were not prefixed

Limit or Full Moon to both: And the Sunday next
following that Limit or Full Moon, is by both

by the Fulian Account or the Old Style, which is till
in Uſe among us; and their Eccleſiaſtical New
Moons being three Days carlicr than.
