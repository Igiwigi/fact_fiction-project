ON “QUIET” DAYS DURING THE ELEVEN YEARS 1890 TO 1900, ETC. 423

§ 55. Considering first the Kew data in Table XLIL by themselves, we see that
the phenomena presented in D and H by ¢,—i.e., the 24-hour term—are ver ‘y similar
to those already described in the case of the ranges. Absolutely considered, b is
least in winter, and is, if anything, slightly greater at the equinoxes than at mid-
summer ; the value of b/a is conspicuously greatest in winter, and least in summer.
The value of b/a for cy is also largest in winter, but in the case of H the summer
value appears also in excess of the equinoctial. At Kew, the values of b/a for ey
are with one exception decidedly smaller than the corresponding value for ¢, ; in like
manner the values for cs are generally less than those for ¢,, and the values for ¢, less

x than those of ¢,. In fact, in summer we have negative values for b/a in ¢, for D, H
S and N. This may be accidental, as the numerical values appear very small, but we
§ may at least conclude that sun-spot frequency exerts but a trifling influence on the
& value of c, at Kew.
s The reduction in the value of b/a as we pass from cy to cs, and from ey to ¢,, is also
© % well shown at Wilhelmshaven, though not quite so prominently as at Kew. Where
g "z the Wilhelmshaven data differ most notably from those at Kew, is in giving a larger
Value of b/a for ce, than for c,, in both H and N.
5 The values of b/a found for ¢, at Kew appear decidedly larger than those found in
‘2 Table XLI. for the range, or even as a rule than those found for the sum of the
3 24 hourly differences.
5. Comparing the different elements at Kew, we see that in c, and ¢, the mean values
Bot b/a for the year are pretty much alike in H and N, and again in D and W, the
