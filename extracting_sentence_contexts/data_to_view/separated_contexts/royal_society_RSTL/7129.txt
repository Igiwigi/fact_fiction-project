Comparing the former set of determinations with these, it appears also that the diver-
gence in both is of the 8ame kind, and therefore presumably due to the same cause. In both the ratio of the descending series gradually diminishes. The true reason is
probably to be found in the fact that more than one gradual change takes place under
the circumstances of our experiments, and that we have only been able to measure the
total result. Our attempts to Separate these actions and investigate them singly have

been unsuccessful, and we have been compelled in consequence to leave the examina-
tion of this reaction, and seek for a simpler case of chemical change. We may, how-
ever, in concluding this part of our work, show, first, from independent experiments,
that we have probably been dealing with more than one reaction; and secondly, that
numbers agreeing with those of all the experimental series may be calculated from
equations expressing the hypothesis that three simultaneous changes take place.
