directly utilise the free nitrogen of the air, some of them, at any rate, may acquire
nitrogen brought into combination under the influence of lower organisms, the
development of which is, apparently, in some cases a coincident of the growth of the
higher plant whose nutrition they are to serve.

Such a conclusion is, however, of such fundamental, and of such far-reaching
importance, that further proof must yet be demanded, before it can be accepted as
beyond question. Should it be eventually fully established, it would certainly suffice


QUESTION OF THE SOURCES OF THE NITROGEN OF VEGETATION. 71

to explain facts hitherto not fully explained. On the other hand, should it not be
established, and a soil source of the whole of the nitrogen of the Leguminose be
conclusively proved, the facts of agricultural production would, it seems to us, be
equally well explained. To this point we shall refer again in our general concluding
observations.

7. The Experiments of Professor Emi, von Wo.rr.

It was also at the Berlin meeting in 1886, at which one of ourselves was present,
that Professor von Wotrr distributed a page of tabulated results of vegetation
experiments, made at Hohenheim, and gave some account of them. A preliminary
series had been made in 1883, and more careful series were conducted in 1884, 1885,
and 1886, Three sets of experiments, A., B., and C., were made, as follows :â€”
