For definiteness, we shall assume an
approximate spherical symmetry. Also, we shall ignore unimportant numerical factors. The fact that the object is self-sustained implies that there is a certain balance among N and @ at
the scale R. If a characteristic wavelength of the constituents is R, the self-sustainability condition
reads

No =1. (1.1)

At large N, this is the case for many field theoretic object such as black holes, solitons or baryons. In more general cases, there can exist several sorts of constituents with different couplings.
