Wave of contraction in spontaneous beat of Frog’s heart taken by double cardiograph. The move-
ment of the lever resting on the base precedes that of the lever resting on the apex. It is note-
worthy that in all cases the contraction at the base outlasts that at the apex.


ACTION OF THE EXCISED MAMMALIAN HEART. 22

organ occurred as a wave starting from the point of excitation. The lever nearest to
the excited point commenced to rise sooner than the more remote one, the difference
being sometimes so considerable as to be plainly visible without record.

This, which is the fundamental fact, was clear and unmistakable in ventricle and in
auricle, and we may anticipate upon a future section of our paper by adding that the
galvanometric indication ef the passage of a wave of negativity was equally clear and
unmistakable in the form of a diphasic variation.

We thus learned that the wave known to occur in the excited beat of the “ stanniused ”
Frog’s heart occurs wnder similar conditions in the Mammalian heart, 7.c., in the excised
quiescent organ. As may, however, be expected, the experimental shortcomings of the
Mammalian heart are more frequent than in the case of the cold-blooded organ ;
complete and typically illustrative results are not obtained without fail, and variations
are so great that a normal time-value of the wave cannot well be given.

But we have obtained records conclusively showing the existence of the wave in
