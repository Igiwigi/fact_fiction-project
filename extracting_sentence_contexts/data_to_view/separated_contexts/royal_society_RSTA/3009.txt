The present paper contains an account of a series of experiments in which
wires were heated for long periods in hydrogen, so that any gradual changes in the
effect of the hydrogen could be observed. It appears that continued heating in
hydrogen alters the character of the effects observed, so that the behaviour of an old
wire may be very different from that of a new one. In the previous paper I suggested that the effect of hydrogen was due to the
presence of hydrogen in the surface layer of the platinum, and this view appeared to
be supported by the facts. Professor O. W. Ricuarpson (‘ Phil. Trans.”
