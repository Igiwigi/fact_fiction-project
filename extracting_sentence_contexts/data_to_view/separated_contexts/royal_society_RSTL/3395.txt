1% #7 Ops INFLAMMABLE AIR

F have generally, , made inflammable_ air, in the
manner deſcribed by Mr, Cavendiſh, in the Philoſo-
phical Tranſactions; from iron, zinc, or tin; but
chiefly from the-two! former. metals, on account.of
the-proceks. being the leaſt troubleſome :/ but when,
lextracted it from vegetable.,or animal Aybſtances,
or from-icoals,.I put them, into/a, gun barrel, to! the.
orifice'of which I luted a- glaſs tube, or the tem of

- a'to-


_
« tobacco pipe, and to the end of this T'tied a flaccid
bladder, in order to' catch the generated air,
- There. is not, I believe, any vegetable 'or/ animal
ſubſtance whatever, [nor -any' mineral ſubſtance, that
is inflammable, but what will 'yield greatiplenty''of
inflammable air, when they are treated in'this'man-
ner, and urged with a ſtrong heat; but;/in order to
get the moſt air, the heat muſt be applied as ſuddenly,
and as vehemently, as poſſible. 'For, notwithſtanding
the fame care be taken in lating, and in'every other
reſpe&, fix" or even ten times more air may be got
by a ſudden heat than by a flow one, though the
heat that is laft applied be as intenſe as that which
was applied ſuddenly, 'A bit of dry oak, weighing
about twelve grains, will generally yield about "a
ſheep's bladder full of inflammable air with a briſk
heat, when it will only give aboat two or three'ounce
meaſures if the ſame heat” be applied” to' it"very
gradually. To what this difference is owing,” I'cans
not tell. ; bl
Inflammable air, when it is made by a quick pro-
ceſs, has a very ſtrong and offenſive ſmell, from
whatever ſubſtance it be generated ; but this ſmell is
of three different kinds; according as the air is ex-
tracted from mineral, vegetable, or animal ſubſtarices,
The laſts exceedingly fetid; andit makes no:differ«
ence, whether it be” extrated from a bone, or even
an old and dry tooth; or from ſoft muſcular fleſh; or
any other part of the animal. "'The'burning of any
ſubſtance occaſions the ſame ſmell: for the-grols
fume which ariſes from them, before: they flame,
is the inflimmable air they contain, which is-expelled
by heat, and then readily ignited, 'The-ſmell of:in-
