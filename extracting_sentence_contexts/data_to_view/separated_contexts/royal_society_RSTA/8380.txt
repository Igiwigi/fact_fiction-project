The positions of the nodes and loop depend on the distribution of depth, and in fact the
northern section proves to be a nodal line. The currents along and near the loop are
obtained by applying an extension of Atryâ€™s rule, to the effect that a quarter of a period
before high water at any place the currents there are directed towards the shoals. But
the complexity of the distribution of depth makes the application of this rule rather
uncertain.
