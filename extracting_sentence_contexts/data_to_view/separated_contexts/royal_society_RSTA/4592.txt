Experiments have been made for testing this point in

the case of light flint glass, showing that the capacity was the same for 1/20000
second and for ordinary durations of time (‘ Phil. Trans.,’ 1881, p. 356), doubtless

because {. ; wW(@) do is small compared with pam Vi(w)da. Now | w (w) dw, when ¢
1/20000

is indefinitely diminished, may be zero, have a finite value, or be infinite ; in fact it

has a finite value. The value of y(@) when @ is extremely small can hardly be
observed ; but [.¥(e) dw, when ¢ is small, can be observed. It is therefore con-
venient to treat that part of the expression separately, even though we may
conceive it to be quite coutinuous with the other parts of the expression.
