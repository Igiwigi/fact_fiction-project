Coox’s paper,t
the method of which is closely analogous with that adopted in the calculations of my
Nottingham paper.

2. Warerston’s Method. Warerston’s investigations take no account of the fact that the molecular
speeds of the molecules of the gas are distributed about a mean, according to such
an arrangement as the Borrzmann-MAXxweELt distribution. Hence in dealing with
planetary atmospheres it is assumed that at any point all the molecules are moving
with the same speed. On such an assumption the conditions for the existence of an
atmosphere are very simple, especially if no account is taken of axial rotation.
