No boundary derivative is
specified, so that this problem is not strictly within the scope of this paper, but it is men-
tioned here as belonging to the biharmonic type of problem, and as an introduction to the
next section. There are no difficulties as regards the relaxation of the finite-difference equations
resulting from (C.2). Both functions u and v are recorded, with their associated residuals,
at every mesh point, and the relaxation is in fact quite easy and much more convergent than
the corresponding treatment of equation (C.1). The method of Fox (1947a) for the treat-
ment of curved boundaries is still applicable, and the only new problem is presented by the
occurrence of the terms 0?u/dx dy, 0Â°v/0x dy in the differential equations. The usual approximation is given, with reference to figure 20, in the form
