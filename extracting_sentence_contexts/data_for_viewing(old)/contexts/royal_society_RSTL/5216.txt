Now Mr. Boyle having counterpoiſed a piece of ice

in a ſcale, hung itout in a froſty night, and found next |
morning that it had loſt conſiderably of its weight by /
evaporation. © Who (ſays he) would have thought
that ſo extremely hard and cold a body would eyapo-

fince that time others have obſerved the fame thing |
which fact ſeems to be an unanſwerable objefion to all
the accounts in which rarefaCtion by heat is made to be
the chief, if not the only cauſe of evaporation ; and,
therefore, we muſt have recourſe to ſome other

As the author of nature does not employ in his
works a greater variety of cauſes than is abſolutely
neceflary; it is the bufineſs of natural philoſophy to
reduce as many phznomena as may be to ſome ge-
neral well known cauſe; and this1s to be done by
comparing the phznomena together in their ſeveral
