from the ingenious labours of Mr. Davy, particularly the
discovery of the important fact, that catechu or terra japonica
consists principally of tannin. #

The united results of the experiments made by these and
other eminent chemists, appear therefore to have fully esta-
blished, that tannin is a peculiar substance or principle which
is naturally formed, and exists in a great number of vegetable
bodies, such as oak-bark, galls, sumach, catechu, &c. &c.
commonly accompanied by extract, gallic acid, and mucilage.

But no one has hitherto supposed that it could be produced
by art, unless a fact noticed by Mr. Cyexevix may be consi-
dered as some indication of it.

Mr. Cnentvix observed, that a decoction of coffee-berries
did not precipitate gelatine unless they had been previously
roasted ; $0 that tannin had in this case either been formed or
had been developed from the other vegetable principles by
the effects of heat. $

Some recent experiments have however convinced me, that
a substance possessing the chief characteristic properties of
tannin may be formed by very simple means, not only from
vegetable, but even from mineral and animal substances.
