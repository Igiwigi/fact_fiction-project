The prime [/, PQ] meets [/, c] in an E-plane ; so that l’ meets o’ in one point, but it
does not meet either o, orc,. Also [/, PQ] meets [P, ¢] in a plane which passes through
P and meets o in a line ; and to this plane there corresponds a line of intersection of o’
and o,. Similarly o’ meets o, in a line, but c, and o, meet only in a point of o’.

The reverse system ¥ consists therefore of cubic primals which have in common :—

(1) A double plane o’.
(2) Two other planes o1, 62, meeting o’ in lines.

(3) A base line I’ incident to c.

We have not so far mentioned one rather important fact, namely that each quadric
transformation given here can be made to yield several transformations for three
dimensions. In the present case, for example, any ®-quadric corresponds to a prime,
Il’ say, of © ; and if we project the quadric from any point of itself unto a [3], Il, then
it is easy to see that Il and II’ are in bi-rational correspondence. In fact to planes of Il
there will correspond cubic scrolls in 1’, which have a double line, two generators,
and two other points in common ; and the reverse transformation will be of a similar
nature.

{2, 8, 4}.

In this, the last quadric transformation in our list, quadrics of © have a plane o and
four other points P, Q, R, 8 in common. The associated net of the curves A’ consists of
