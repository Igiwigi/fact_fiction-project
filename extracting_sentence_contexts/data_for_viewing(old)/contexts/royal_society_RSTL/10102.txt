hemisphere we likewise observe medullated fibres which radiate outwards to the cortex
along its whole extent, and proceeding solely from the corpus callosum do not form
such dense aggregations, but light radiating fibres some distance apart. Tn the limbic
portion, however, the same fibres are present, plus a strong reinforcement from the
posterior extensions of the anterior commissure, 4.e., the central olfactory fasciculus.
Here then appears demonstrated an important fact, that the, cortex of the modified
olfactory type (Plate 49, fig. 1, T to W), receives medullated radiations 80 extremely
rich in fibres that it is mapped out to the naked eye from the neighbouring extra
limbic medulla by its notable white brilliant aspect, and that these fibres include the
terminal expansion of the central olfactory fasciculus.

Here again we meet with two mntra-cortical arciform stripes of medulla disposed as
in the modified upper limbic arc, viz. â€”

(a) A superficial streak ab the lowesb confines of the first layer.

(b) A deeper streak beneath the large swollen cells of second layer.*
