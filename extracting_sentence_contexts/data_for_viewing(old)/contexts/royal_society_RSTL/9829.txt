O. E. Megyes,t on the contrary, thinks that the canse of the discrepancy is to be
found in the fact that the expression © radius of molecular attraction ” (Wirkungssphiire)
is used in the theory of capillarity in a sense different from that in which it is employed
in the theory of gases. He believes that, if we possessed a kinetic theory of liquids,
the magnitude investigated by QUINckE and PLATEAU would be found to be that of
the free path of the molecules in the liquid, or would acquire some similar meaning.

PraTear's experiments consisted in measuring the pressure of the air confined in a
s0ap bubble by means of a water manometer. A decrease in that pressure might be
expected if the thickness of the film became less than twice the radius of molecular
attraction. His conclusion is based on the fact that no regular change was observed in
the case of a bubble which lasted for three days, and thinned to the pale yellow of the
first order of NewrToN's scale.

Lipres formed a liquid film at one end of a cylindrical tube, and, when it had
become thin, closed the other end by a newly formed film. A 8mall quantity of air
was then forced into the enclosed space through an orifice in the 8ide of the tube. The
films assumed the form of spherical segments, and it was found that that produced
by the thinner film was the less curved. The inference that the superficial tension
increased as the thickness of the film diminished, was supported by other experiments,
for an account of which we must refer to the original paper, We may, however,
remark that the large magnitude assigned to the radius of molecular attraction, and
the statement that the superticial tension is increased instead of diminished when the
