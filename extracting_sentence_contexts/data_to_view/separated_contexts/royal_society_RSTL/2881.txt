SwammerDan, Reaunur, and Huses
were all of opinion that the Hive Bee does not at all enter into a tate of hybernation,
but continues active during the winter, Hue states expressly*, that 80 far from
bees becoming torpid in winter, the temperature of a populous hive ranges from 86?
to 88? Fan. when the thermometer in the open air is several degrees below freezing. But these authors have been deceived with regard to the real fact. The Hive Bee
certainly does not become torpid, but if entirely undistarbed it passes into that con-
dition in which its temperature of body and quantity of respiration are very greatly
diminished ;—a $tate of deep sleep in the combs, but a sleep which, s0 far from being
continued at a very low atmospheric temperature, then becomes broken, and is only
continued at a moderate temperature. It is true that when the hive is disturbed in
the winter, and it becomes 80 very readily, its temperature is 800n raised to a great
height.
