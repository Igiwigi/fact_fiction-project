the plant-remains.

The fertile spikes and isolated sporangia of Zosterophyllum australianum add
nothing to our previous knowledge but clearly connect this flora with that of the
Centennial Beds from which the species was described. The discovery of character-
istic branch-systems which doubtless belong to this plant is of more interest.
They agree with branch-systems belonging to Z. myretonianum (LanG, 1927) that have
long been known from the Lower Devonian of Scotland and were originally figured
by Hucu Mixer (1857, fig. 123). A branch-system of this type from the Perry
Basin, Maine, which was described by Wurre (Smita and Wurre, 1905) under the
name Psilophyton alcicorne, was referred to the Upper Devonian. Srwarp (1931,
p. 124) suggested that it probably came from a lower horizon and that it might
well have been a piece of Zosterophyllum. The fact that the branched axes under
consideration here were found associated with fertile spikes of Z. australianum makes
it almost certain that they were the vegetative portion of that plant.

The evidence obtained as to the occurrence in this flora of fairly large stems
that bore simple leaves which must have been of considerable size, is of interest in
several respects. The specimens are most naturally compared with Baragwanathia
from the Monograptus Beds. In the imperfect condition in which the specimens are
preserved a comparison with Drepanophycus would also be possible, but the portions
of the leaves that persist are more suggestive of Baragwanathia. In any case the
occurrence of a plant of this type connects the flora with that of the Monograptus Beds.
The only addition to our knowledge made by the specimens from Mt. Pleasant is
the demonstration of the form of the epidermal cells.
