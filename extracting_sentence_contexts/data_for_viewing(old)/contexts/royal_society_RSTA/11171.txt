results had given almost identical values for the displacements of the zinc and
cadmium lines. There is here some contradiction which requires clearing up by
further experiments.

Bismuth (fig. 25, Plate 11) gave us most interesting results, as it possesses some
lines, such as y, which are curved so little that the velocities of the molecules giving
these lines is found to be larger than that observed in any other case except aluminium,
On the other hand, the line at 3793 (¢) indicates the smallest velocity measured.
There are some special difficulties standing in the way of the measurement of the
bismuth lines, which made us hesitate some time before definitely asserting the
different curvature of the lines, but we think that our best photographs, one of which
is reproduced in fig. 25, leave no doubt on the question. One of the difficulties lies in
the fact that bismuth and mercury are the only metals in which the lines are repeated,
owing to the oscillatory discharges. When six jars are in circuit, the appearance is
that of fig. 26, and the lines become mixed and difficult to measure. Another difficulty
lies in the great difference in the sharpness of the lines even on the stationary film,
the lines which show a small curvature being much sharper. There was a possibility
of an illusion due to this cause, similar to that explained in the case of the double
zine lines, but we cannot believe that the difference in curvature between the lines
marked (y) and (¢) in fig. 5 can be due to this cause.

[April 26.] We possess very few investigations on the spectrum of bismuth:
Lecog pE BorsBAupRAN, who is acknowledged to have purified his substances with
extreme care, gives the line 5209 («) as one of the characteristic lines of bismuth, and
he also gives 4302 (8) and 4260 (e) as belonging to bismuth. The relative intensities
