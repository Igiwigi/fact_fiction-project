Firstly, the ions were mass-selected and the experiments measured the recombination
products directly, practically eliminating impurities or mistakes in ion identification. Secondly,
the high-energy merged beams approach allowed for energy-resolved measurements with
unprecedented resolution. The final and possibly most significant advantage was the fact that
the ions were typically stored for several seconds before the actual recombination experiment
was initiated. During those initial seconds in many cases, all vibrational excitations—which were
known to impact the recombination rate—would decay completely and leave a coasting beam of
molecular ions in their vibrational ground state. With a few exceptions [9,10], the rotational state of the molecules was neglected in most of the
early measurements and has only come into focus for studies of a handful of important ions like
Hy [11-15], HDT [16] and D3O0* [17].
