N. and E. of Wheatley the formation suddenly terminates, or rather
continues to be represented only by the Ampthill Clay. Apparently the ordinary type
of Corallian was never deposited in this direction, although fossils indicate that the
equivalents of most of it are present. The fact that pelilithic sedimentation was here never interrupted indicates the preval-
ence of very different conditions. What where those conditions? The most satisfactory
answer is the stiller, deeper water of a landlocked sea, in which deposition proceeded more
gradually than in the open southern ocean.
