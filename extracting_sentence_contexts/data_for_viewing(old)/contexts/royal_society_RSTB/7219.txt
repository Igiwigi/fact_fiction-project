called the ‘journey time’. This naturally would depend on how far apart the sample units
are located, that is, on the density of the grids, but should be independent of the size of the
grids; and this has been fully corroborated by actual field records. Next comes the time

required for locating the grids, identifying the plots, examining the crops and making
necessary field records. This has been called the ‘enumeration time’; it should increase
with the size of the grids but should be independent of their density. This also has been
corroborated by experimental studies. In large-scale sample surveys the ‘journey time’ is
by no means negligible in comparison with the ‘enumeration time’. In fact, in the case of
the jute survey the ‘journey time’ is actually three times larger than “enumeration time’,
This is the special feature in large-scale work which makes necessary the approach adopted
in the present paper. Besides the ‘journey’ and the ‘enumeration’ time there is also the time
required for miscellaneous work which consumed practically a constant fraction of the day.
In the case of the statistical work also the total number of computer-hours could be split up
into different components. One portion of the work depended merely on the total area
covered and was independent of both size and density of grids. Certain items depended on
the size but not on the density of grids and certain items on both size and density of the sample
units. In the case of uni-stage sampling the general scheme has become fairly clear and has
been discussed in Part III. The cost function for multi-stage sampling naturally would be
more complicated, but may be developed on similar lines, both in the abstract as well as
in the concrete. No new principles are, however, involved and further consideration is
