One way of accounting for the fact that an electric field has no effect on the rain-
like condensation under consideration would be to suppose that the nuclei are
produced at the moment of expansion. They might, for example, be caused by the
motion of the piston or plunger through the water. The fact, however, that the
condensation is just as easily observed when the cloud-vessel is connected with the
rest of the apparatus by a bent tube of considerable length, as for example in the
apparatus shown in fig. 2, shows that this is not the source of the nuclei. The question whether the nuclei which exist in small numbers in moist air are

qgharged or not must, I think, be left an open one for the present.
