Sn 13°5. 22°5 per cent. by weight. This alloy is important, because it fixes the point / at which the amount of « formed
above the C temperature is just enough to re-act with the whole of the residual C
liquid in order to form B ; in fact, the re-action a, + liquide = 8; can complete itself
in this alloy. Sn 13°5. Sic. chall at 805°.
