The adult stands in the relation of having been
elaborated from its host and cannot be supposed to have had no experience of a host,
although it may be an experience on which little further can be said. It has been maintained by Thompson and Parker (1927) that the selection of hosts
by parasites is a typical example of an instinctive action on the part of the insect, the
hosts chosen being those which are suitable for the development of the progeny of the
parasite. Reference of this behaviour to an “‘instinct”’ is merely a description of the
observable fact that under natural conditions the reproductive activities of the female
parasites are so integrated that, among many suitable and unsuitable hosts recognized
by the observer in any given ecological station, the females usually find and parasitize
those from which their progeny are able to emerge. If this were not a general rule,
parasitic species would soon be non-existent. The behaviour is described as instinctive
because the female’s actions are such that they are preadapted to situations which are
