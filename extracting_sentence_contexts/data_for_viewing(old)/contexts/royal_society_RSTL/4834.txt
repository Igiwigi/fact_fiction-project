In conclusion, it may not be out of place to consider how far the preceding
researches affect the received views regarding the constitution of the ammonia-
salts. Without reproducing all the arguments bronght forward by the supporters of
the various theories, we may remember that, irrespectively of the impossibility of
isolating ammonium itself, the instability of its oxide has been adduced as one of the
most important objections against the assumption of the ammonium-theory as ori-
ginally snggested by Amets, and snbsequently elaborated by BerzeLivs. It deserves
to be noticed that Berzeivs expressly states that he considers the solution of am-
monia-gas in water as a Solution of the hydrated oxide of ammonium.

This idea, which is but a logical conclusion from the generalization of the facts, is
discountenanced to a certain extent by the chemical and physical character of this
Solution. Everybody knows that, even at the common temperature, this liquid splits
again into water and ammonia, while it still exhibits the character of the latter in 80
marked a manner, as almost to preclude the idea that it had undergone as essential
a change as the transformation into oxide of ammonium necessarily must be, Under
these circumstances, some interest is attached to the discovery of a series of com-
pound bases, corresponding in their composition to hydrated oxide of ammonium,

* A similar result is obtained by the action of iodide of ethyl upon conine and nicotine,
