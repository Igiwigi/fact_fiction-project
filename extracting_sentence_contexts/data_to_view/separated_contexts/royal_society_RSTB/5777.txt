flora, be considered as a complex population in which groups flourish locally and for
a period when the food supply or other conditions favour them. No outstanding

soil, water or air types; e.g. the organism from Beer stone (BS,), found almost pure
at a depth of 24 inches, is a slender motile rod agreeing in character with Pseudomonas
jluorescens. Assuming the origin of the stone flora to have been the soil, a certain
selective influence of the stone habitat is noticeable in the fewness of sporing organisms
and the complete absence of large sporers like Bacillus mycoides, B. megatherium, and
B. mesentericus.
