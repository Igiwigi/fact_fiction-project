It appears from these experiments that the © titre” of the electrized gas is precisely
the same after the passage of the gas over these metals as before the experiments, and
also that the volume of the gas is unaffected, the results being the same as though the
gas had been passed-through the solution of iodide of potassium alone.

When the electrized gas is passed through a solution of binoxide of sodium the ozone
is destroyed, and a certain portion of the binoxide of sodium also is decomposed. 'This
reaction is constantly referred to as an ascertained fact, but has never been really
investigated. It was of great importance, in relation to the theory of this reaction, to
ascertain by experiment the relation which exists between the two decompositions.

The points to be ascertained were :—the * titre” of the electrized gas, the oxygen lost
by the binoxide of sodium, and the ratio of this oxygen to the © titre,” also the expan-
sion undergone by the electrized gas, the difference, that is, of the volumes of the gas
after and before the experiment, and the ratio of this difference to the © titre” of the gas.

The oxygen lost by the binoxide of sodium was determined by titration of the solu-
tion of the binoxide of sodium before and after the experiment with a standard solution
of permanganate of potash, according to the method described by me in a former paper*.
From. the difference between these two titrations the amount of oxygen lost by the
