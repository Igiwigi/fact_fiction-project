The study of this specimen, and more especially of the scapulocoracoid arch and its
appendages, led to the identification of many other specimens of the anterior parts
which were not before supposed to have belonged to this genus. The facts brought to

light by these discoveries, and the more extended obseryations based thereupon, fully
corroborate the conclusion arrived at by Professor AGas81z, that this genus, although
differing generically from the Sturgeons of the present epoch, belonged, nevertheless, to
the same family. These facts I now proceed to particularize in detail, commencing
with a general description of the most perfect specimen, and proceeding step by step
through the anatomical characters displayed in the several UL OPEc ns 1 have examined,
8 far as their state of preservation will allow,

The most perfect specimen yet discovered (Plate LXVII. I) is contained in a nodule of
indurated lias. The rostral and caudal extremities are deficient, and it is otherwise much
injured by the attempts to relieve it from the matrix in which it is imbedded. Excluding
what remains of the head, and measuring from the articulation of the pectoral fin with
the scapulocoracoid arch to the hinder margin of the anal fin, the length of the trunk is
15 inches. The greatest vertical depth is immediately in front of the dorsal fin, where
it measures 6 inches. In a recent Sturgeon having the same longitudinal dimensions,
the greatest vertical depth is only 3 inches, or in proportion to the length as 1 to 5, the
