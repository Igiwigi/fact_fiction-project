§ 8. Method of Observation of the Strain in
Celluloid.

In view of the fact that the provisional theory of § 6
would not fit the observations we decided to observe
directly the actual strain in the celluloid, and an ex-
tensometer was devised to enable us to measure this.

The ends of the celluloid specimen were securely
fastened in two clamps A and B (fig. 8), the upper
one being suspended from a fixed support, while the
lower could be loaded by means of a lever and weights.
Through the jaws of the upper clamp passed a hori-
zontal spindle P, along the axis of which was mounted
a small mirror M. ‘The spindle was provided with a
weighted arm L, which rested on the end of a light
