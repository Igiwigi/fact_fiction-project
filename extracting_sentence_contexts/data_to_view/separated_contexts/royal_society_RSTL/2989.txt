He 'must, therefore, like many
other travellers, have noted down what he had -collected
from hearsay, in which, amidst much that was surmised,
there was something approaching to the truth. It is in
evidence that/the art was kept a profound mystery among
those who (professed 'it, 80 that the different modes of em-
balming described with -such orderly minuteness of details
by Heroportvs, could only have been conjectural. It is a
curious fact, that, with the exception of the lateral incision,
and immersion into a saline solution mentioned by that histo-
rian, we find no confirmatory evidence of the other steps of
the supposed processes of embalming detailed by him in any
of the various mummies that have hitherto been examined. And in the one now submitted to the inspection of the So-
ciety, by far the most perfect that has yet been publicly
described, we have none of the characteristic features of the
three several modes of embalming which we are told were fol-
lowed by the ancient Egyptians; while, on the other hand,
some of 'the lesser features of each process are strikingly
apparent. We have, in fact, the presence of that which
Heroporus asserted was invariably removed in the better


Egyptian mummies.
