the convergence of the probability integral requiring that the coefficient of x' should be
negative, and the five quantities a, p,, p., Ps, ~, being connected by a single relation,
representing the fact that the total probability is unity. Typically these curves are bimodal, and except in the neighbourhood of the normal
point are of a very different character from the Pearsonian curves. Near this point,
however, they may be shown to agree with the Pearsonian type ; for let
