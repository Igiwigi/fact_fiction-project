brown colour, and the same acid being neutralized by hydrate of lime, yields in small
quantities a salt exhibiting all the properties of nitrate of lime. The latter being
treated, for instance, with carbonate of ammonia, produces a salt which, when mixed
with some strong sulphuric acid and brucine, strikes a blood-red colour, disengages
fumes of hyponitric acid, &. From these facts it appears that nitric acid is present
in the phosphatic acid, the former being produced during the oxidation which phos-
phorus undergoes in moist atmospheric air.

I have further ascertained that hydrate of lime, being suspended in water and 8uf-
ficiently long treated with ozonized air, produces a salt exhibiting the properties of a
nitrate.

M. FseLLexnBERG has published* results which lead also to the conclusion, that
either nitrites or nitrates are formed in treating hydrate of lime with ozonized atmo-
spheric air, and the same chemist has made observations with the phosphatic acid
coinciding with the results I have obtained from my own experiments. The philo-
sopher of Lansanne is rather inclined to identify ozone with hyponitric acid. I think,
