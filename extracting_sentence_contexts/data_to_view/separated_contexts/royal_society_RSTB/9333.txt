The paper by Edmond et al. [60] offers, in my view, no
viable solution for this, because it takes a practice-wide
‘rate’ for a constructive piece of information in the individual
case. For example, the study by Ulery et al. [35] reported a
rate of false positive is 0.1%. I cannot foresee how the fact
finder will consider an average error rate when an expert tes-
tifies to an opinion of identification. If nothing in the case
indicates that the expert deviated from the standard practice,
his or her opinion will be simply trusted. It means that that
claim that the ‘probability of an error considered as so
small as to be dismissed’ will be simply admitted without
any further reference to the average value of 0.1%.
