When
z pressure is applied to the cerebral hemisphere, especially above and in front, we have
= = such displacement of the encephalon that in spite of the support given by the
2 tentorium (which it is to be remembered is bony for the most part in the Carnivora)
4 the cerebellum is driven through the foramen magnum. Consequently, the removal
gof the pressure effect is readily accomplished by trephining the occipital bone, and
Sraising the vermiform process so as to lift off the compression which it is effecting
= upon the medulla.

= Direct Mechanical Influence upon the Medulla.

& We are now brought to the final consideration of a very interesting question we
3 Braised on p. 206, viz., the possibility of the pressure effect being in part due to
§ excitation at the point of the brain chiefly pressed upon. From the facts which we

have related on p. 209, there was no reason to believe that such an excitatory effect
Q existed. But we now wish to mention a direct experiment which we made in connexion
with this subject, and that of mass displacement. The experiment consisted of
division of the mesencephalon, after which it was found that pressure was just as
active as before in calling forth the changes in the circulation and respiration.
