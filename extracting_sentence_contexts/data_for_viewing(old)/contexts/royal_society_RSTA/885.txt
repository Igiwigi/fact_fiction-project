The excitations in conventional superconductors,
Bogoliubov quasi-particles, are spin-4 fermions
but their charge is energy-dependent and, in fact,
zero at the gap edge. Therefore, in superconductors
Accepted: 16 April 2016 (unlike normal metals) spin and charge degrees of
freedom may be separated. In this article, we review
spin injection into conventional superconductors
