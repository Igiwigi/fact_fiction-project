feature which seems to be shown also by the repeating ring system proposed here for
the keratins. The diketo-ring is formed by the condensation of tivo amino-acids ;
and if it is true that the transformation from the «- to the $-form of hair is accompanied
by a destruction of the ring system (5-15 A.U.) to produce a longer, more reactive
system (6-64 A.U.), then certainly the stretched structure is characterised by a strong

X-ray reflection, not of spacing 6-64 A.U., but of spacing 3-32 A.U., a fact which suggests
that the elongated molecule is in some way of a two-fold nature, in the sense that it
consists of two similar parts attached end to end. In this connection it may be
mentioned that the ordinary peptide chain
