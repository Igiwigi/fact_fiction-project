for ¢—c which is (numerically) too small and a value of e/i which is too large (but note
that this value of e/i is very nearly the same as that for m = 0, which differs somewhat
from the observed value, owing to the fact mentioned already that Chapman took
the average of the results for several different harmonics in his calculations). The
result for ¢—c is improved by halving the value of 4, as in the next entry in the table,

but this makes ¢/i too large; this can be remedied by increasing g, which scarcely affects
et. The next result shows that g = 1 is too large; evidently a value about 0-98 would
be satisfactory.
