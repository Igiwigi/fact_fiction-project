Euclidean geometric framework — paralleling the proposed com-

putational role in mammals as an early developing Kantian-like

spatial scaffold that serves to organize perceptual experience...

(From Banino et al. [216].)

Non-Euclidean: By contrast, at our meeting and in [220], Ida
Momennejad argues that it’s the non-Euclidean aspects of
place and grid cells that need accounting for, such as the distor-
tions of grid cell firing fields by rewards, as well as the fact that

the majority of distance estimates in the hippocampus reflect
path distance (taking into account obstacles) rather than
direct Euclidean distance [221,222].

Reinforcement learning has been proposed as a way
of capturing these non-Euclidean properties of place and
grid cells. Gustafson & Daw [223] argue that an emphasis
on path rather than Euclidean distance reflects the fact that
place and grid cells ‘are well adapted to support reinforce-
ment learning’, since efficient reinforcement learning
requires that the inputs (place and grid cells) are already
