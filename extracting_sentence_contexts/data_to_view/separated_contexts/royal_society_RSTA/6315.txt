To understand why this is, we need to
look at the temperatures of each cohorts choices for each game. Each cohort represents a distinct but uniform population; each game must have the same
temperature for each cohort by the third law. The fact that they do not suggests that something is


skewing their choices at the quantum level. The students had temperatures of $2.0 and $0.23 for
games (i) and (ii), respectively. The traders had a similar pattern of $0.29, $0.12 and $0.23 for games
(i), (ii) and (iii), respectively, suggesting that they are less risk-averse than the students, while
retaining the ambiguity aversion [3], the preference for (i).A.
