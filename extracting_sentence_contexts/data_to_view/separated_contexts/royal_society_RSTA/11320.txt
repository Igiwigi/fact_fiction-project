An attempt to test this was
made by furnishing two out of the four vessels with gold sleeves suspended in the
entry tubes. A run of 92 hours at 30° C. gave 0°0018 gr., 0°0013 gr., 0°0004 gr., and
0°0010 gr. respectively, and the gold sleeves were not found to have altered in weight. Hitherto the vessels, while on the balance, had not been closed; in view of the fact
that the errors now seemed to be considerably less than heretofore, it was thought
better to have vessels made with their entry and exit tubes fitted with ground-
glass stoppers. These vessels were then tested as before. OSMOTIC PRESSURES OF AQUEOUS SOLUTIONS OF CALCIUM FERROCYANIDE. 187
