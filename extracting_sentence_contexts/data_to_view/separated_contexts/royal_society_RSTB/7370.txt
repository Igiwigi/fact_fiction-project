If the impurity indicated by the total nitrogen content to be
present in the arginine was non-nitrogenous, it is evident that, as Macpherson claims,

the recovery of arginine by the hydrolysis procedure, which in the above experiment
amounts to 97-7 %, is not complete. Estimations made on proteins would, in fact,
require correcting by the addition of 2:3 % to the determined values. We are, however,
loth to apply such a correction for the following reasons. Determination of the arginine
content of salmine gave an uncorrected value, expressed as the percentage of the total
nitrogen due to arginine, of 88-9.
