been several minutes. At last they were all utterly exhausted and could have held
out no longer; then they felt the air clearing, the heat diminished, though still very
great, and they clung to the boat for a few minutes before they were able to get into
it again.

One man was not so good a swimmer as the others, and his strength was soon
exhausted. He held on to the gunwale of the boat and took the risk of burning
rather than of drowning. He described to us the insufferable heat and the sulphurous
smell, and he was rapidly becoming unconscious when the air cleared. The sea around
was hissing, and it was so dark that two men hanging on to the boat, side by side, could
not see one another, even though they could touch. There was a continuous loud noise,
but a person speaking in an ordinary tone of voice could easily make himself heard.
This is a curious fact, for the report of this explosion was heard at Barbados. But
Mr. McDonatp confirms the statement. He noticed particularly that when he
gave orders to his men to launch the boat and leave the shore, he did not require
to exert himself in the least to make them hear him.

While this man remained clinging to the gunwale the hot sand rained upon
him. His woolly head was wet and the sand, was cooled by contact with it, but
it gathered above the lobes of his ears, and there the heat was sufficient to dry
his skin and produce painful burns. He told us that when the cloud had
passed there was enough sand on his scalp to fill his hat twice over (the hat was
an ordinary round straw with flat brim). It formed a layer 2 or 3 inches deep.
The ash fell dry, there was no rain and no scalding mud. When they got back
into the boat they found it nearly filled with fine ash and stones, and these were so
