CHRISTIE ON THE USE OF THE BAROMETRIC

to be added to the error of the first, observation, which becomes then —*091 ; and
the mean error derived from the two observations is —*099.

"The instrumental error thus diminishing appears to indicate that there is a point
on the scale where it becomes 0, and beyond which, as a correction, it must be ap-
plied in a negative form ; and this point can readily be determined on the principle
that the differences of the errors are proportional to the differences of the correspond-
ing boiling-points; for, calling B the point on the scale at which the error vanishes,
b. I, e and & two other points and their corresponding errors, we have the equation

b—B-0:£0),
b—U ee”
—2. 6.(0—0Þ)
whence B=b— =

and, substituting in this the values above found, viz.
b=208:967, V/=197-649,
e=— *589, e=— -099,
we find B=195:363. In order, by means of this result, to determine the correction to be applied as a
multiplier to the number of degrees above or below B, it remains to determine the
amount of error due to each degree, which, in fact, when its sign is changed, will be
the required factor; calling this correction C, we have

It may be remarked, that the principle on which the determination of this correc-
tion is founded remains unaffected by the supposition that the errors from which it
is derived are partly attributable to the diameter of the bore of the thermometer in-
creasing uniformly in descending ; this I have satisfied myself by the usnal means
to be the case, though to a comparatively trifling amount,

The observations recorded at the Geneva Observatory and those at the Great St,
Bernard afford an excellent means of applying my own to the determination of
the height of my several stations, since those places present the advantage of being,
the one my starting-point, and the other a position central to my series of stations. The readiest way of thus applying them appears to be, to reduce the height of the
barometric column as given in millimetres to the form of the corresponding tempe-
rature of boiling water, by means of Ds Luc's formula above given, and then, for
the determination of the difference of altitude between each station and Geneva, and
the Great St. Bernard, to employ the formula

H={548(6—Þ)+24D} {1 +(t—32)-00222},
where D is the difference in degrees between B(=195'4) and the observed boiling-
point; and the factor 24 is the product 548 X 0433 ; the sign + being used when
my own $tation is {owest and vice versd, because the instrumental error is always one
of defect.
