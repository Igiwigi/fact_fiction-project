that the existence of a true renal portal vein in Elasmobranchs is either ignored Â©
or expressly denied by the writers of all the more important zoological text-books
with the single exception of RoLLEsToON (24), STANNIUS (25), Ming Epwarps (14), |
on the authority of Hy, Huxrny (10), GecexBAUR (7), MacarlasreR (13), and
CLavs (4) all state explicitly that in Elasgmobranchs, as in Cyelostomes, the caudal
vein opens directly into the cardinals. MACALISTER certainly states that branches
from the cardinal veins enter the kidneys, forming a reno-portal capillary plexus,
and GEGENBAUR mentions the existence of similar ven@ renales advehentes as branches
of the caudal. But neither author gives a sufficiently detailed account to enable
the reader to understand what the exact relations of the renal portal system are
supposed to be.

As a matter of fact JourDarxs, following up the earlier researches of Jacops0N,
Ropin, STEENSTRA Tous8AINT, and others,* has clearly proved the existence of a
renal portal system in Raja, Squatina, Squalus, and Spinau, in all of which he
shows there to be no direct passage for blood between the caudal and the cardinal
veins in the adult. I have confirmed JourDaAin's results in Raju nasuta (21, 23),
and now find that they hold good also for Mustelus antarcticus.

The renal portal veins (Plate 34, figs. 1 and 3; Plate 37, figs. 22, 23, 24, Ren,
port. V.) formed, as stated above, by the bifurcation of the caudal vein, pass forwards
each along a groove on the dorsal aspect of the corresponding kidney, sending off
numerous afferent renal veins (venz renales advehentes) into the substance of the
gland, and gradually diminishing in calibre towards its anterior end (ec. figs. 24, 23,
and 22, Ren. port. V.).
