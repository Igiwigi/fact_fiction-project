When a dry mixture of carbonic oxide and hydrogen is exploded with 12 to 15
per cent. of oxygen, at a pressure greater than the critical pressure, and at a tom-
perature 8ufficiently high to prevent any condensation of steam, the coefficient a 18
found to be 4 when the hydrogen is equal to or greater than the carbonic oxide, but
3:7 when the carbonic oxide is three times the hydrogen. This difference I believe to
be due to the fact that carbonic oxide and oxygen, under the conditions of these experi-
ments, are incapable of direct combination, 80 that when the volume of hydrogen taken
is less than double the volume of the oxygen, there is present during a part of the
reaction an excess of oxygen chemically indifferent to the three other gases present—
steam, carbonic oxide, and carbonic acid.
