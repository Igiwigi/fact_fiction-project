Lamb waves are singled out where the structure of
interest is plate-like, and this has proved very powerful in the inspection of composite laminates
[5]. It is arguable that the prediction level is not critical for NDE as almost all inspection
methods involve taking the structure out of service for more detailed analysis or repair. In fact,
almost all applications will be offline. Some element of ‘prediction’ is accommodated in the
general philosophy of NDE, as code-based inspections ultimately relate the estimated damage
to estimated consequence, based on structural integrity calculations.! The important parts of the
identification hierarchy for NDE are thus:

(i) DETECTION: the method gives a qualitative indication that damage might be present in
the structure.
(ii) CLASSIFICATION: the method gives information about the type of damage.
(iii) ASSESSMENT: the method gives an estimate of the extent of the damage.
