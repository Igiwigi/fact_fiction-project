If the fame man-
ner of reaſoning be uſed, with reſpect to the bed of
marine bodies, mentioned above, which crofſes the
mountains, that ſeparate Provence from Picdmont,
we ſhall be obliged to preſume, that the time, when
thoſe mountains were under the waters of the ſea,
was at a very great diſtance from the preſent. Monſ. Donati concludes from theſe facts, and the
conſequences deduced from them, that the Mediter-
rancan ſea is a very ancient, and not a modern one,
as Monſ. de Buffon imagines,

Thoſe, who explain all the phanomena of marine
bodies found out of the ſea, by an univerſal deluge,
do not admit the conſequences drawn by Monf. Do-
nati from thoſe marine bodies: now under confidera-
tion. It is plain, that moſt of the naturaliſts, who
have obſerved a great number of theſe marine bodies,
are not of opinion, that all thoſe phaznomena can be

- explained by an univerſal duluge.
