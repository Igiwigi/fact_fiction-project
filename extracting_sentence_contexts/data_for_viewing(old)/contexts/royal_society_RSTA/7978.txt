nitrogen peroxide concentration actually occurred before the spark had passed, so
that it could hardly have been caused by flame. Further investigations will be needed
to settle definitely the source of the nitrogen peroxide ; for it is possible that the
proportion of NO in the exhaust gas is considerable, and that during the compression
stroke the residual NO becomes converted to NOg,, the detection of which, if SO,
is also present, may sometimes be interfered with. The quantity of NO, should
then be dependent mainly on the temperature of the flame during the explosion.

Whatever the source of the NOg, there is very little evidence that it has more than
a secondary effect on the phenomenon of “ knock ” except with hydrogen. Although
organic nitrites, etc., are ‘‘ pro-knocks,’’ NO, itself is not an active “ pro-knock”
of hydrocarbon fuels in the engine. Furthermore, some substances, such as cyclo-
hexane, which give rise to large amounts of NOg,, do not readily knock. The fact
that the amount of nitrogen peroxide formed increases with the intensity of ‘* knock,”
however, indicates that the same causes which produce the nitrogen peroxide also
produce the conditions necessary for ‘“‘knock”’ tooccur. There is, in fact, evidence that
the two processes are very closely interconnected, for the addition of acetyl peroxide
induces NO, formation at a very early stage in the stroke. If the NO, is formed by
catalysis at the surface of the valves, the experiments suggest that the amount also
depends on active products from other reactions which are taking place there, and
particularly those reactions connected with formation and decomposition of those
substances present when “ knock ”’ occurs.
