follow from these properties of the discharge are also manifested, and serve in their bu
to demonstrate the identity between discharges in high-vacuum and in Jow-vaeut
tubes. Thus very good unipolar and double unipolar effects can be obtained, w
festing, with certain modifications, the same peculiar phenomena which we
accustomed to 8ee in connexion with them in low-vacuum tubes. So easily are
effects attainable that (as will be seen later on) they afford to us the readiesb way!

And if we recollect how intimately the existence of unipolar and double unipolar d
charges in ordinary vacuum tubes is connected with the fact that the discharge ©
each terminal is independent of the action elsewhere than in its own neighbourho
we shall see that the existence of similar phenomena in high-yacuum tubes is strol

here are phenomena of the relief and special effects in tubes of high exhaust, which
