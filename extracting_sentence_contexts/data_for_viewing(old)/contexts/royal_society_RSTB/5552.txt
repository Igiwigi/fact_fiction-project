through a potassium hydroxide bubbler A to remove carbon dioxide, then through a
concentrated sulphuric acid bubbler B and a sterilized cotton-wool filter C. The gas
is further sterilized by bubbling through dilute mercuric chloride solution (1 : 1,000)
in D and finally through another sterilized cotton-wool filter E. The bubbler D serves
a double purpose. Since it contains mercuric chloride solution, it helps to sterilize
the gas in addition to maintaining saturation of the gas with moisture, thus avoiding
evaporation of the contents of flask F. The efficiency of the sterilization effected by
the above method is shown by the fact that, although relatively large volumes of air
are passed through the culture flask F during the course of an experiment, often lasting
several weeks, cases of infection have been extremely rare.

(2) Cultivation of the micro-organism—tThe culture being studied is grown on a
suitable culture medium in a 750 c.c. conical flask F, the neck of which is closed by a
sterile bung, carrying an inlet glass tube which reaches practically to the surface of the
culture medium, and an outlet tube, the end of which only just passes through the bung.
Each end of each tube is fitted with a cotton-wool plug, and the whole fitting—bung
and glass tubes—is sterilized in the autoclave immediately before use.

(3) Absorption and collection of the gaseous end-products—The gas stream, as it
emerges from the flask F, contains carbon in the form of carbon dioxide and traces of
