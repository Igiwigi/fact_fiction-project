of Frogs. Woop pointed out that whether applied in a liquid or concentrate
gaseous form a par alysant effect was produced. Brunron speaks of amyl nitrite a
a muscle poison in common with all other nitrites. Pick also noticed its paralysa
action. As we desired to employ a comparatively simple tissue in further contr
experiments upon the nitrites, and as Frog’s muscle seemed to fulfil this conditio
we instituted the following inquiry into the direct action of the vapours of nitri

| peo the muscles of Rana temporaria. The paralysant action of nitrite is seldom
well developed in instances in which the drug has been administered by injection, no
doubt from the fact that the heart’s activity is apt to be much depressed before there
has been sufficient access of nitrite blood to the muscular system to produce a marked
| effect upon its irritability. All the experiments in this series were made with the
triceps (extensor of the leg) and gastrocnemius of Rana temporaria. One of the
selected pair of muscles was introduced into a muscle chamber which, whilst being
absolutely air-tight, admitted of a connection between the muscle and lever for
gecording purposes. This chamber, which had a capacity of 50 cub. centims., was a
Guodification of the one described by one of us (C.) in vol. 184, ‘Phil. Trans. ;’ it was
Blosed hermetically above by an india-rubber stopper fitting perfectly air-tight ; whilst’
Bhe opening through which the thread passes to the lever was closed below by a little
Giercury. The thread works without friction. Stimulation is effected by passing a
gingle opening induction shock from the electrode in contact with the femur clamp, to
fhe tendo Achillis, by means of a fine wire attached to the hook inserted into the
