verticils, The Calamarian affinities suggested by these facts are further supported
by the Sphenophylloid structure of its vegetative axis described in my last Memoir.
We thus obtain from Bowmanites a fresh illustration of the fact that the old genus
Asterophyllites is a purely provisional one, comprehending several very different plants.
The plant has been obtained from the Caleareous nodules of Coals which have fur-
nished us with so rich a harvest of new forms. TI have received it from the Footmine
near Oldham, from the hard-bed at Cinder Hills near Halifax, and from Dulesgate.
