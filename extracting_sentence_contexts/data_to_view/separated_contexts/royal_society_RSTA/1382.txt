Thus the reverse system ¥ consists of quintic primals which have in common :—

(1) A triple plane a.

(2) Two double planes o,, o meeting o in lines. (3) 4 rational quartic ruled surface meeting o in two generators and meeting each of

locus V,**; and we see immediately that these are just the planes which meet I,‘
in conics ; for the points of a conic of F,* correspond to lines joining a point of | to the
points of cy.

Also the locus of planes corresponding to points of c, is of order four V,*; and since
one of the planes of K passes through any given point of c., every plane of V,* contains a
generator of F,*, and it is in fact the plane joining the generator to the fixed point O
which corresponds to the plane of c,. Hence V,° is the locus of planes which meet ¥*
in conics and V;! is the locus of planes joining O to the generators of F.*.
