It can be, therefore, argued that their
behaviour becomes to some extent habitual or automatized:
a cognitive state that contrasts dramatically with the declara-
tive and deliberative stance of description-based choices
taken by humans [113]. In addition to that, training in mon-
keys (and other animals) often involves simplified versions
of the task (often deterministic contingencies), which may
reinforce specific risk preferences. Although the role of
extended (several days, weeks) training and the resulting
behavioural automation (or habituation) in risk preferen-
ces is unclear, it may contribute to the fact that human
description-based biases are rarely observed in monkeys.

5. Conclusion and perspectives

Our review suggests that the rhesus monkey is a partial model
of human decision-making under uncertainty. Risk preferences
in monkeys are generally better explained as experience-based
processes.
