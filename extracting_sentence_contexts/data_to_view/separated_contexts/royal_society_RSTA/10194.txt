QUARTZ FIBRES AND ITS TEMPERATURE COEFFICIENT. 419

the observations for the absolute value of the modulus it had already been observed
that the period of torsional vibration diminished slightly as time went on, thus
indicating an increase in the rigidity of the fibre. This was also shown in some of
the observations at higher temperatures, but the effect was not nearly so marked as
in the case of metal wires. In fact, in some instances the rigidity apparently
diminished slightly on keeping the fibre for some time at a high temperature. In addition to the determination of the periods of vibration, observations of the
logarithmic decrements of the amplitudes of the oscillations were taken at each
temperature, in order to obtain the correction to apply to the periods for the damping
of the torsional oscillations. As an example of the observations taken I give below the figures obtained with
the first fibre experimented on over this range of temperature.
