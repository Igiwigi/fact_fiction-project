in the expanded function, we first of all find the complete coefficient of a* and then
operate upon it with the Hammond combination of operators

The result is an integer followed by the sum of an infinite series of symmetric
functions. The integer mentioned is the number we seek.

Art. 5. We now expand the generating function. On well-known principles we
can assert that the coefficient of a‘ in the expansion is the homogeneous product-sum
of order k of unity, and of the whole of the a, 8, y, ... products which occur in the
denominator factors of the generating function. The elements, of which we must
form homogeneous product sums are, in fact, ,

We can form these product-sums from the sums of the powers of these elements,
because we have before us the well-known symmetric function formula
