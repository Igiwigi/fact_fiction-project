Further evidence that resolution has little effect on extreme precipitation beyond what
is expected by figures 1 and 2 is provided by the normalized error metrics of the Taylor diagrams
(figure 5). The distance between points representing models of different resolution from the same
modelling groups is small and both normalized RMSE and Taylorâ€™s modified skill (table 1) exhibit
only minor improvements at high resolution. In fact, skill values of extreme 3h precipitation
accumulations over the CONUS region for the HighResMIP models are quite similar to global
land skill values for extreme daily precipitation accumulations for the CMIP5 and CMIP6 models
[23]. Indeed, as extreme daily precipitation errors are highly correlated to mean precipitation
errors [23], it is not surprising that sub-daily errors would be closely related to daily errors. There is no systematic error pattern across all modelling groups, for all but one pair of models
with an ancestral relationship.
