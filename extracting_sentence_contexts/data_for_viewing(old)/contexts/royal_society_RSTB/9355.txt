its discovery, the transmitter function of ATP took decades to become accepted
Gerhard Dahl in the scientific community. The signalling function of ATP was first postulated
e-mail: gdahl@med.miami.edu in 1929 [4] and reformulated in 1953 and 1954 [5,6]. Starting in 1970, the tena-
city of Burnstock et al. [7-9] finally led to the establishment of the field of
purinergic transmission. The field has now grown to such an extent that the
‘Purines 2014’ meeting was attended by approximately 550 researchers.

To act as a transmitter, ATP has to negotiate the plasma membrane of the
ATP releasing cell before it can act—sometimes after breakdown as ADP,
AMP or adenosine—on purinergic receptors (P1, P2X or P2Y) on a targeted
cell. Four pathways for ATP release need to be considered.

(A) Like many other transmitters, ATP can be released by exocytosis. In fact,
often ATP is co-packaged and co-released with classical transmitters, such as
acetylcholine or norepinephrine [10-13]. Further support for exocytotic/vesicu-
lar ATP release is the identification of vesicular ATP transport proteins [14,15].
Exocytosis allows for fast and targeted release of ATP onto receptors and is the
prominent if not exclusive ATP release mechanism at nerve terminals [16,17].

(B) Several observations indicate the existence of alternative ATP release
pathways. ATP is released from cells, such as erythrocytes [18], that do not con-
tain vesicles under physiological conditions. In many cell types, there is uptake
of extracellular tracer molecules correlated with ATP release [19,20]. Several
membrane channel blockers, including carbenoxolone, can attenuate or even
completely inhibit ATP release from cells and block tracer uptake [21]. These
