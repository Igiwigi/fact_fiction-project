sand” from Fox Bay proved, on microscopic examination, to be composed largely of
magnetite, with much hypersthene, some ilmenite, augite, and plagioclase feldspar,
and sparse fragments of dark brown hornblende and quartz. All these minerals are
derived from local agglomerates and tuffs.

Only one “foreign” pebble was seen on the local cobble beaches, especially charac-
teristic of the windward coasts. This was a pink foliated granite found by Mrs Jaggar
near O’Garra’s. It contains scraps of chloritized biotite and a little sphene.

(iv) Coastal cliffs. By far the greater part of the coast is fringed by cliffs of con-
siderable height. They characteristically truncate the spurs between the radial ghauts.
Hanging valleys have been locally produced between the truncated spurs (figs. 27, 28,
Plate 5). Davis drew attention to the fact that truncated spurs are characteristic of
most of the islands of the Lesser Antilles (Davis 1926). He thought they were formed
because coral reefs that had once protected the islands from wave erosion, were
destroyed during the Pleistocene Glacial Period. The writer regards the cliffs as due
to marginal submergence and marine erosion (p. 19).

The highest cliffs are those just north of Roche Bluff, which rise fairly steeply to
about 1000 ft. (fig. 24, Plate 4). There is another great cliff (possibly 450 ft.) at North- .
West Bluff in the north of the island.

It is worth noting, in connexion with the coasts of Montserrat, that there is practically
no rise and fall of the tide. This makes many of the cliff sections inaccessible. It is,
however, possible to scramble along the shore line all the way from O’Garra’s past
