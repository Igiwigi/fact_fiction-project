Then
they gradually left the shell and lived in the surrounding medium until the strong
contamination with bacteria made an end of them. These observations offer an example of how various flagellates might be mistaken
for microspores or microgametes. The possibility that some of the microspores described
were in fact parasites has been often discussed (GEITLER 1931 ; FRrTscH 1935). Where the
formation of microspores was preceded by nuclear divisions of the diatom cells (GRAN
1902, 1904; KARSTEN 1904, 1907; BERGON 1907; SCHILLER 1909; HorKER 1928) the
simple assumption of parasitic infection is clearly unsatisfactory.
