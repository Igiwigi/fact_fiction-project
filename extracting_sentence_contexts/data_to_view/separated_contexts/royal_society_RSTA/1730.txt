272 MAJOR A. E. OXLEY ON THE INFLUENCE OF MOLECULAR

“The former experiments showed a dissimilarity of action between magnetic and
diamagnetic crystals. In the present instances, both are’ magnetic, but still there is a
difference ; the axis of the one prism stands axial, the axis of the other equatorial,
With regard to the explanation of this, the following fact is significant. Scapolite
cleaves parallel to its axis, while beryl cleaves perpendicular to its axis ; the cleavages
in both cases, therefore, stand axial, thus agreeing with sulphate of nickel. The
cleavages hence appear to take up a determinate position regardless of outward form,
and they seem to exercise a ruling power over the deportment of the erystal.
