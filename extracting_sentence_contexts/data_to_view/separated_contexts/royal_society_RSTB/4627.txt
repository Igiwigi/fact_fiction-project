diversity of colouring noticed on the surface. In fact, the colours may be due to
several organic films, giving different surface colours, though what the nature of these
films may be it is difficult to say. The only thing like them that is known is a thick

when moistened, at whatever depth the surface is exposed. A slight modification
of this chitin might easily produce a red or a green colour instead of gold.
