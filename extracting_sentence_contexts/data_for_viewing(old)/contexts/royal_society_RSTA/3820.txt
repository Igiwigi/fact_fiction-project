the temperature of the working body, contacting with this source, should be constant. Moreover,
for the Newtonian kinetics, ratios of temperatures of the working body and the temperatures
of source should be constant. Therefore, the temperature of the working body needs to change
proportionally with the temperature of the source if the latter changes because of the finiteness of
the source’s capacity.

(a) Thermal machine

For sources of an infinite capacity and an arbitrary heat transfer kinetics, the optimal cycle of
a thermal machine with maximum power needs to be composed of two isotherms and two
adiabates. It has been shown that the efficiency corresponding to the maximum power and
Newtonian kinetics, nca, called the Novikov-Curzon—Ahlborn efficiency, is independent of
heat exchange coefficients a;. In fact, for an endoreversible system with Newtonian kinetics the
maximum power efficiency, 1nca, is only a function of Carnot efficiency

Mca =1— V1 ~n0. (8.2)

In this case, the maximum difference between nc and mca is achieved when the ratio of :
absolute temperatures of cold and hot sources equals 0.25, whereas nc = 0.75. For power yields :=
lower than the maximum possible yield, a maximum efficiency of the thermal machine working Ds
with infinite sources (reservoirs) can be described by the following equation: :3
