The length (or the time period) of the â€”1 portion of the
signal divided by the total length of the signal is the negative time fraction. Figure 1a shows
this time fraction for different Reynolds numbers (presented by different symbols) as a function
of the normalized wall distance yt /V5* =y/ /5(v/u;). The normalization (by \/6(v/u;), the
intermediate length scale) is to highlight the fact that in boundary layers the beginning of the
inertial region starts at ~3V5*. The averaged time fraction within the inertial region (ending
near 0.155) is presented in figure 1b for increasing 5*, where it is evident that the time fraction
approaches a constant ~1/ = 0.618... with increasing Reynolds number. Here, we note that
the start of the inertial layer may be different for boundary layers than in pipes and channels.
