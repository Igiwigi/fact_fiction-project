as when unloaded. Thus the temperature effect on the susceptibility is negligible.

We have so far considered only the large spheres, M, M; but it is evident that if
the small spheres, m, m, are quiteun magnetised, the susceptibility of M, M would be
immaterial. Separate tests were therefore made on the magnetism of m, m, and these

tests may be considered crucial. Curiously, it was found that though these were the
purest silver obtainable from Messrs. Johnson, Matthey and Co., they were both in
slight degree permanently magnetised. This is in itself an interesting fact. The
torsion system used here is, in this case, a most sensitive magnetometer and when a
N. pole of a bar magnet was brought outside the vacuum, slightly above one silver
sphere, it repelled it, the corresponding scale reading being 4 mm.; whereas when
the N. pole was below, there was a like attraction. This permanent magnetism was °
removed with some difficulty by the passage of a current through a coil round the
yacuum tube, until at last the scale reading was reduced to the small amount of
0°2 mm. for each sphere. Thus the permanent magnetism was reduced to 1/20th of
its former amount. Several days later the spheres, m, m, were again tested and were
found to remain demagnetised. Probably the permanent magnetism was originally
produced when the heating coils round the vacuum tube were excited during
production of the vacuum. (See § VI., paragraph 9.)
