Allowing for the thickness of the steel tape, the circumference is 48'485,

From the measurements made with the calipers and tape, the mean diameter of the
cylinder was 15370 and 15:433 centims, respectively, and the total mean 15:4015
centims.

It will be observed that the external diameter is nearly, but nob quite, uniform
throughout ; this no doubt arises from the fact that the paper was not quite uniform
in thickness. Inside, as far as could be judged by inserting a straight edge, the bore
of the cylinder was perfectly uniform throughout.

The inside diameter was determined by the calipers at the top and bottom, at eight
different places in all. Tt was also determined by gauging the thickness of the walls
of the cylinder at the top and bottom by means of a wire gauge, and subtracting
twice the thickness from the external diameter as measured by the tape. The
internal diameter, measured in the two different ways mentioned above, was exactly
the same for both, namely, 14872 centims. The mean of the internal and external
diameters is 151395 centims., and the mean radius 7:5698 centims.

The length of the paper cylinder was 60:80 centims., and the mass, allowing for
