the equation having in each case a positive root which is called 9. The properties of
the equation are the same in each case ; but for the sphere, the equation being a quadric
one, can be solyed. The equation in fact is

P-UC+—f)—&f*=0,

and the positive root is therefore

=HO+&f—FP + (O+2—f)Y +46 f*}-

Suppose e to gradually diminish and become =0; for an exterior point, z >f, the
value of the radical is =z*—f*, and we have =z*—f*; for an interior point, »<F, the
