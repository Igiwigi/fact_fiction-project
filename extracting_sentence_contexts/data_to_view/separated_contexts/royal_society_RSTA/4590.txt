The stable branch of equilibria in the lower right of the bifurcation diagram represents circular
trajectories of the aircraft with a very small radius. The aircraft actually becomes stationary at very
high steering angles, and (f) is an example. In this stopped position, a force impulse (e.g. a thrust
impulse or wind gust) causes the nose gear to start dragging across the ground if no braking is :
applied (the aircraft will in fact stay stationary if the brakes are applied). The aircraft accelerates =
in a straight line, as is shown by (g), until a velocity on the top branch (i) is reached. This stable 3
branch (h) of equilibria is somewhat counterintuitive in the sense that the radius of the circular
trajectory decreases as the steering angle is decreased.
