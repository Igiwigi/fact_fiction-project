in which Lo = gag (9+ +WH)—mo(F24+Ry . These equations are not of the canonical form, because R,, is not, the same for all the
planets. But it is easy to put them in the pseudo-canonical form (art. 74.), a process
which is not necessary, but saves trouble by bringing them under the operation of the
general rules of transformation established in former articles,

In fact, if we take ,

where the summation in the first term extends to all the planets, and in the s8econd
to all their binary combinations, and a horizontal line placed over any letter indicates
exemption from differentiation, we hall have

[The terms = &e. are only written for the 8ake of uniformity, being really =0,
since Q does not involve ug, vg, wy. ]

In these equations Z and Q are the same for the whole sy7stem, and the differentia-
tions of Z are total; but those of Q are restricted to the quantities not marked by the

position at any instant with respect to the original axes is defined, as in art. 72, by

the variable direction-cosines 3,, &c. Let Tg, Ya, * be the new coordinates, and

Ug, Þg, 9 the new variables conj ugate to them, The transformation will be effected,
as in art, 72, by taking for the modulus

(where Q is expressed in terms of the new variables, and @,, «,, », (the angular velo-
cities of the moving system of axes about the three moving axes themselves) are
marked with the horizontal line to show that these quantities are exempt from diffe-
rentiation in forming the following system of differential equations, though they may
be functions of the variables); then the system (91.) is transformed into
