. parted with the seven-eighths Arabian mare to Sir Got
OvsELEY, who has bred from her by a very fine black Ara-
bian horse, I yesterday morning examined the produce,
namely, a - two-years old filly, and a year-old colt. They
have the character of the Arabian breed as decidedly as can
be expected, where fifteen-sixteenths of the blood are Ara-
bian ; and they are fine specimens of that breed ; but both
in their colour, and in the hair of their manes, they have a
striking resemblance to the quagga. Their colour is bay,
marked more or less ke the quagga in a darker tint. Both

are distinguished by the dark line along the ridge of the
back, the dark stripes across the fore-hand, and the dark
bars across the back part of the legs. The stripes across
the fore-hand of the colt are confined to the withers, and to
the part of the neck next to them ; those on the filly cover
nearly the whole of the neck and the back, as far as the
flanks. The colour of her coat on'the neck adjoining to the
mane is pale, and approaching to dun, rendering the stripes
there more‚Äù conspicuous than those on" the colt. The same
pale tint appears in a less degree on the rump; and in this
circumstance of the dun tint also she resembles the quagga.
