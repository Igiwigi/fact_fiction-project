The oxide gradually
disappears and the metallic surface of the supporting strip is perceptibly
altered, probably owing to the action of the liberated calcium or oxygen ;

(3) When lime is heated so that no current goes through it there is no large
emission of electrons. The only one of these which appears to the writer to be conclusive is the
last. The first result follows from the fact that the emission from lime is much
greater than that from calcium,* and it is not necessary to attribute the emission to
the process of oxidation. The second result supports the view that electrolysis
takes place, but does not support the theory further than that; but from the third
result it appears that electrolysis is essential in order to obtain a large electronic
emission from lime.
