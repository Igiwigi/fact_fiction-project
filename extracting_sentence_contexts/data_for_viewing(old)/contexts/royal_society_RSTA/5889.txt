Here, ¢ is the solution of the transport equation (2.2) on Té with initial data ¢. For simplicity, and
without loss of generality, we will now assume j = 1.
Next, we let i: A; > R¢ be the pullback of U under ¢. That is, we define

i= (gy ')*(U) = (Dey "U) © 91.
Since ¢1 preserves the Lebesgue measure, and V . U =0 we must also have V - ii = 0. Now extend

it to be a C! divergence-free vector field supported in (—3,4)%, and let 6 be the solution to the
transport equation

a0 +i. VO =0,
in R¢ with initial data 6. By the construction of ii and the fact that 6= @ © g1 on 929, we must have
8(x,) = b(yi(x),#) for all x € 21,
where 2; is the image of 29 under the flow map of i after time t. Hence,
