than an actual movement in the subterranean expanse of molten rock : to speak only
for example sake, such as would result from a change in position of those inequali-
ties in the ellipticity of the earth's surface, which seem indicated by the measurements
of arcs of meridians. It may also be inferred, from the facts given in that paper, that
the fluidity of the nucleus must be tolerably perfect. In the yolcano, even the lava
which is propelled to the summit of a mountain, far beyond the subterranean isother-
mal line of melted rock, and poured out on the surface, is oftentimes s0 fluid, that it
runs into thin sheets like molten metal. Also at the junction of the plutonic with
the metamorphic formations, we see tortuous thread-like veins branching from the
former into the latter, which could only have been injected when quite liquid. Here
the rock has been melted at a great depth under an enormous pressure, and yet the
fluidity must bave been very perfect: snch plutonic rocks moreover form the beds
on which all others rest. Considering these latter facts, together with the inferences
deduced from the phenomena observed in South America, it may be granted as not
improbable in any high degree, that this part of Scotland when it was upraised rested

on matter possessed of considerable fluidity, which underwent a slow change of form.
If this be granted, there is no great difficulty in conceiving that the surface of the
interior molten matter might retain that degree of curyature proper to it, as the
resultant of the unknown force with that of gravity and the centrifugal impulse.
Moreover, as we must conclude from what we now see going on in South America
and in Scandinavia, that the area affected was large, the difference between the amount
