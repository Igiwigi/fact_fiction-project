air, ;- part only of the heat which it loses is acquired by the air;
for 957 is to 9597, as 1 to 27, very nearly. But I shall refrain
from enlarging farther on this subject at present.

One of the objects which I had in view, in the last experi-
ment, was, to find out whether the cooling of a hot body in air,
is or is not sensibly accelerated, or retarded, by the greater or
lesser distance at which the body is placed from other neigh-
bouring solid bodies, when these neighbouring bodies are at the
same temperature as the air; and, as a comparison of the result
of this experiment, with the results of the two preceding experi-
ments, 80 strongly indicated that the cooling of the conical
vessel, in the preceding experiments, had in fact been retarded
by the vicinity of the pewter platter over which it was suspended,
I was now-induced-to repeat these experiments with some
variations. Y b

These investigations appeared to- me to be: of the more im-
portance, as I conceived that the results of them might lead to
a discovery of one of the causes of the warmth of clothing.

Exper. No. g2. I now placed the pewter platters once more
in their former stations, perpendicularly under the bottoms of
the two conical vessels, but at the distance of g inches only ;
that which was under the vessel No. 5 being at the temperature
