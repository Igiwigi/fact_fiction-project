Thus in aged subjects aggregations of lacunal cells may
here and there be found with but few osteal cells and but little intercellular tissue,
while in a young subject osteal cells will preponderate. In all cases a direction may be given to the cells of a growing part, by their being
in relation with the insertion of a tendon. A consideration of the foregoing facts will, we think, lead to a conviction that the
two different forms in which bone is developed, are designed to meet the require-
ments of the animal at different periods of life, and that bone developed by means
of osteal and lacunal cells is the higher form of the tissue. In early embryonic life
a oft, cartilaginous skeleton is laid down, which is hard as compared with the sur-
rounding parts, and capable of affording them the required amount of mechanical
support. As the various tissues advance in development the cartilage increases in
density by the elaboration of its hyaline tissue, and after awhile those changes occur
which precede its conversion into bone.
