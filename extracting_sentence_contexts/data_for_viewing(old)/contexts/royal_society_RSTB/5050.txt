These tetraradiate spines bear a somewhat superficial resemblance to the spines of an
Asteroid, especially as regards the absence of a definite tubercle on the plates to which
they are atached. But the development of the spines of Asterina gibbosa, Lupwic
(1882), is in close agreement with that of the typical Echinoid spine for, although
apparently commencing as a small triradiate, the base becomes hexaradiate and a single
vertical process arises from the centre of the base.

The development of the spheeridium shows conclusively that it is really a reduced and
modified spine. The foundation of the globular portion consists of six (in some cases
five) prongs, similar to those of a typical spine but greatly reduced in length. The
irregularity exhibited by the base (fig. 10, a-e) is due either to the total loss of a varying
number of rays or to the fact that some of the rays remain abortive. The stalk of
the sphxridium, which corresponds to the expanded basal portion of a spine, shows the
same tendency to reduction. It always remains narrower than the upper portion,
and no branches are developed corresponding to y and y’ (compare figs. 6 and 7, with
10, f). TuiseL (1892) found that two spheridia are sometimes formed in a single
ambulacrum in the case of Echinocyamus, but that one of these is later subject to a
“retroactive developmental process.” In E. miliaris a second primordium sometimes

appears closed to the one which is destined to form a spheridium. ‘This granule appears
to undergo resorption.
