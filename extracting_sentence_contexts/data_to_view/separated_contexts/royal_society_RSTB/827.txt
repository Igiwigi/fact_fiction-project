We believe that a certain degree of laxity in the use
of this expression has crept in by the employment of the word “ associated.” The
= term association connotes physiological co-operation and arrangement in the nervous
~, system, i.c., motor representation when the term is applied to movements. With this
6 view the expression “bilaterally associated movement” has been frequently used to
= characterise the activity of the trunk muscles. We showed in our Internal Capsule
“2 paper that this was not justified by the facts, since the somatic or trunk muscles
8 are as unilaterally represented, with the exceptions denoted in Table I., as are the
EB limb muscles. This point has been treated of late by Saerrtncron,* who has since
°8 shown that even the sphincter ani is unilaterally represented. Whatever may be the
"s physical condition, 7.e., movements of different muscles for the performance of definite
£ acts, there does not seem to be any ground for assuming, as has been so frequently
@ done, that certain muscles, e.g., those of the trunk, act in association, or that they
= are, therefore, bilaterally represented.
— Apart from the special physiological interest attaching to this question of bilate-
+ yrality, it is impossible for neurologists to correctly appreciate the pathology of epilepsy
S or the restoration of function when certain districts of the cerebral hemisphere have
- been destroyed until this question has been settled.
