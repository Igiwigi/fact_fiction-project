absence of traces of foreign gases, in particular chemically inert gases such as nitrogen
or paraffin hydro-carbons which cannot readily be removed by chemical re-agents, the
most stringent precautions must be taken. In selecting a method for preparing a
gas it is less important to secure a high initial state of purity than to avoid the
introduction of substances that are afterwards difficult to separate; the presence of
a trace of nitrogen may be much more troublesome than a considerable quantity of
carbon dioxide. â€˜Treatment of gases by strongly heated solids is often unsatisfactory,
because, although a particular impurity may be eliminated, some other impurity may
be acquired.

In this investigation we have relied on physical rather than chemical methods for
the ultimate purification of the gases. The case of hydrogen is peculiar in that it
cannot conveniently be liquefied, but advantage may be taken of this very fact to
separate impurities that are more readily condensible.

We began this investigation in July, 1911, and completed the experimental work
in July, 1915. The apparatus was set up in an underground cellar below the
Schunck Laboratory, and this room was reserved exclusively for our use.

Preparation of Hydrogen.

The work of H. B. Baker has shown that very pure gas is obtained by the
electrolysis of an aqueous solution of barium hydroxide, and this is the method we
have adopted throughout for generating hydrogen. The electrolysis was carried. out
in a U-tube constructed of boro-silicate glass (fig. 1, A), fitted with electrodes of
