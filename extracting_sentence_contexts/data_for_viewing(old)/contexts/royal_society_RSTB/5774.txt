2. A thick cingulum is present.

3. A mesostyle is completely absent.

4. The parastyle is but little developed.

5. The third and fourth upper premolars are triangular with five conical tubercles.

6. The lower molars have four distinct cusps arranged in two rows, the internal
cusps are conical, and the external sub-crescentic. The third molar has a
strong bicuspid talonid.

Several of these points are incorrect as to fact, and appear to have arisen from a consi-
deration of Owenâ€™s figures rather than from a close examination of the actual specimens.
The cusps are certainly conical in shape, but not more so than can be seen in some
specimens of Hohippus. It has been shown above that there is at least the beginning
of a mesostyle in H. leporinum ; while the parastyle is quite as well developed as in
Eohippus or in Pachynolophus, its alleged absence being due to damage as has already
been described. Such differences, then, as have been observed to exist between the British
and American forms amount to no more than specific variations and in no instance
are of sufficient magnitude to enable them to be described as different genera.

It remains therefore to consider the relations of Hyracotherium to various European
genera. Pachynolophus (the genotype P. duvali), according to Depirert, differs from
Hyracotherium in that the external cusps are compressed, the intermediates (protoconule
