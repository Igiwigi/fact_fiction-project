are varied. The Dirac monopole is a consequence of the properties of the wave function hence
predicted by quantum mechanics. The existence of isolated magnetic poles is linked directly to
the quantization of electric charge in the theory. The t’Hooft-Polyakov monopole is motivated
by grand unified theories (GUTs) and is expected to be massive. There could no monopoles
within our observable Universe [7], the implication of that would be a futile search for a particle
that would be effectively impossible to detect. From an experimental perspective, the prospects
of searching for that signature are extremely daunting. The Cho-Maison monopole is a hybrid
between the Dirac and t’Hooft-Polyakov monopoles.

The theoretical motivation for such particles, including the link to the foundations of quantum
mechanics and GUTs makes searching for these particles compelling. Reverting to the Higgs
boson for a moment it is worth reflecting on the dual between application of quantum field theory
to condensed matter and particle physics that led to the prediction of that particle in 1964. The fact
that, in condensed matter, Dirac monopoles have been found to exist [8] is somewhat reassuring
that there might also be a particle physics analogue.

Ionizing particles passing through material will lose energy with a characteristic energy loss
as discussed in [9]. Those with electric charge obey the Beth—-Bloch energy loss relation
