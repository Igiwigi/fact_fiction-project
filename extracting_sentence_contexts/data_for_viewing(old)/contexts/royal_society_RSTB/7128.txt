The Bassy Mine of Lancashire was correlated by Wray (1929) with the Soft Bed of
Yorkshire, a conclusion which subsequent more detailed work has confirmed. Shells from
the corresponding fossiliferous series above the Soft Bed, from the second of two recent
boreholes at Bradford, Yorkshire (Hudson & Dunnington 1938, 1939), were examined by
Professor A. E. Trueman. A series of bands above the Soft Bed Coal were recorded in
detail by Hudson and Dunnington and the faunas of ten successive selected intervals
examined separately. All Wright’s species were identified with more or less certainty and
many of his illustrated variants strongly represented. While Wright’s norms, Carbonicola
fallax and C. protea together with C. recta Trueman, were the most abundant forms, C. fallax
and C. protea merged so completely that separation was almost impossible. Although the
variation at every level was very large, Professor Trueman noted that ‘there seems to be
a closer similarity in many of the specimens and a more limited range of variation than is
illustrated in Wright’s paper’. He pointed to differences in lithology and the fact that
the larger shells were mostly found in coarse grey micaceous shale while the smaller speci-
mens were found in the softer and darker shales.

The present paper is the first of a series of detailed studies on the Soft Bed-Bassy Mine
succession made by the writer under tht supervision of Professor Trueman. Their object
is to determine, by the study of thin bands and communities, to what extent and in what

* Professor Trueman and Dr Weir, in A Monograph of British Carboniferous Non-Marine Lamellibranchia,
Paleont. Soc., Part 1 (1946), p. xv, have pointed out that the genus Anthracomya, founded by Salter in 1861,
was already preoccupied, the name having been used by Rondani for a genus of Diptera in 1856. They
proposed therefore the name Anthraconaia for the lamellibranchs previously classed as Anthracomya. Anthraconaia
