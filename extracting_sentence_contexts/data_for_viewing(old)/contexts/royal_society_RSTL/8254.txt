a purely empirical one, based on experiments made within very limited ranges of
perature, within which it appears to agree more closely with the observed law
Newron's more simple formula. Nevertheless we can obviously feel no assurance
it is generally true, nor indeed can we employ it, like NewrToN's, to determine the
of the temperature of the hotter over that of the cooler body, without knowing one
other of the two temperatures.

1 feel that T should not conclude this paper without bearing testimony to the energy.
and perseverance with which my assistant, Dr. RaLyn CoPELAND, has conducted the
observations which form the subject of the greater part of it, as also to the great
care and the ability with which he has worked out the reductions. I had hoped
to have sent, in this paper before the close of last Session ; but the greater completeness
which is the result, of the delay, as well as the fact that the exceptionally unpropitious
state of the weather would have prevented our profiting, in a new series of observations
by any suggestions which might have come to us, have removed all cause for regretting
this. One thing I should have much wished to have added to this investigation had
there been any reasonable prospect of doing s0 without considerably more delay—namely,
a more satisfactory determination of the value of the scale, by means of a comparison of
the deviations due to solar with those due to lunar radiation, than that given in a former
communication based on observations made with an uncertain sky and of only two or
three hours” duration.
