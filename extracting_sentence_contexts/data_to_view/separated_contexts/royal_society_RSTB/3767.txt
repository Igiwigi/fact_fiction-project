With continued regular growth of prophylls and perianth-segments, differentiation of
six low rounded primordia takes place on the andreecial region, while a trace of a
collar-growth begins around the gyneecial papilla (fig. 15 : 6; bud, 0Â°53 mm. high). The six papillee indicating the stamen-primordia appear simultaneously, and are of
identical size and appearance in all early stages; but the two lateral members are
lower down than the other four. In fact McNas (1872) missed them altogether, as
Ss they would not be seen from above. There is no evidence that the lateral stamens are
5 in any way different from the others or arise earlier; if they represented a normal
rs outer whorl, they should be developed earlier and be always growing ata greater rate
