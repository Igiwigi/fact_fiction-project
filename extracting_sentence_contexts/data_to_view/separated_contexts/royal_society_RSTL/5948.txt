Adding all
together, we find the sum of the widths of the three branch glaciers to be 2597 yards. At Trelaporte these three branches are forced through a gorge 893 yards wide; and our
measurements show that it passes through with a velocity of nearly 20 inches a day ! Limiting our view to one of the glaciers thus compressed, the facts appear still more
astonishing. Previous to its junction with the Talefre, the Glacier de L6chaud has a
width of thirty-seven chains and a half. In passing through the jaws of the granite
vice at 'Trelaporte, this broad ice river is 8queezed to a driblet ess than four chains in
width!
