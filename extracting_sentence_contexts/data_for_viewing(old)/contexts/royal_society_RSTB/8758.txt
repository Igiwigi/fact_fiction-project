within an animal should be co-prime, which could theoretic-
ally allow representation over a very large range (up to the
product of the grid scales [8,9]). However, the effect of
noise in neural firing potentially undermines the theoretical
n=ll 45° ° A orienorion (°) * capacity of co-prime grid modules, because ambiguity
for dissimilar scale becomes possible between locations where the firing patterns
of different modules nearly align (figure 2). The effect of
noise is not irrecoverable in small environments [6], but
could be much more disruptive in larger environments.

The impact of noisy firing on the spatial range encoded
by grid cells and on the optimal organization of grid scales
has not been fully explored. Nonetheless, the fact that errors
caused by ambiguity will typically be extremely large (ie.
decoded locations will be far from the correct location), leads
to the suggestion that combining the grid cell system with a
slow-moving representation of location will prove optimal
[10]. Such a representation is potentially provided by place
cells in the hippocampus [11]. Each place cell typically fires
in only a single location [12] so that during normal locomotory
activity the overall pattern of activity does not change rapidly.
Thus, large errors in the grid cell representation of location
