which the rest of the Medusa presented cannot have been due to any variations in the
quality of the contact between the electrodes and this stationary seat of stimulation,

we are compelled to regard the facts of artificial rhythm as of a purely physiological
kind. The question, therefore, as to the explanation of these facts becomes one of the
highest interest, and the hypothesis which I have framed to answer it is as follows. Every time the tissne contracts ib must as a consequence suffer a certain amount of
exhaustion, and therefore must become slightly less sensitive to stimulation than it
was before. After a time, however, the exhaustion will pass away, and the original
degree of sensitiveness will thereupon return.
