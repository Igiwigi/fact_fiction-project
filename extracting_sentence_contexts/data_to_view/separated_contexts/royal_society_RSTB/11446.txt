The pathways to suicide are complex, with suicide being the end product
of an interplay of biological, clinical, psychological, social, cultural risk and
protective factors [2-4]. Although knowledge of risk factors for suicide has
grown markedly in recent decades [4], our ability to predict suicide is no better
now than it was 50 years ago [5]. There are many reasons why the field of suicide
research has not enhanced its predictive ability; key candidates include the low base
rate of suicidal behaviour, as well as the fact that risk factors are often assessed in
isolation and in a static rather than in a dynamic fashion [5]. In addition, until rela-
tively, recently, there was a paucity of comprehensive theoretical frameworks that
have attempted to understand the emergence of suicidal ideation and the transition
from thinking about suicide to attempting suicide/dying by suicide [6]. In the present paper, we focus on one such predominant framework, the
integrated motivational-volitional (IMV, [6]) model of suicidal behaviour; we
describe its theoretical origins, the key premises underpinning the model,
empirical tests of the model and future research directions.
