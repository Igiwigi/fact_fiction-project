Indeed, activation within the these networks during exposure
to desirable objects—specific food, addictive drugs, sex—is
often interpreted as evidence for this network being the Posi-
tive Affect system. However, this system is likely just part of a
global system of behavioural integration, and as a matter of
course is activated during exposure to an individual's priori-
ties, which should be part of their programme of actions. In
fact, damage to the NAc or VTA can produce a state of pro-
found torpor, not a loss of pleasure. In Parkinson's disease,
which affects DA projections in the basal ganglia, it is the
ability to prioritize but not to execute motor actions that is
compromised (named about 100 years ago as a ‘paralysis of
the will’ [156]). The basal ganglia are known for control of
both motor and motivational features of habits, learned
units of behaviour that cortical systems use as building
blocks for the integration of complex behavioural pro-
grammes.
