ation a role exclusively as inputs or outputs. Instead, we
propose to leave open to investigation the conditions under
which this assumption may be valid as a limiting case.

3. Arguments against the interactive brain
hypothesis (R.A.)

The other one of us (R.A.) disagrees with the above view
because it seems to disregard a natural partition to causal
interactions in the world. That is, there is a much more
direct and dense set of causal interactions internal to the
brain, than between brain and external environment. Dis-
regarding this fact leads to a concern that the IBH renders
unclear the specific role of social neuroscience (as opposed
to social psychology or sociology or behavioural studies of
crowd behaviour) in explaining social behaviour.

In order to understand cognition, we need to partition
cognitive systems. In particular, we need to partition them
into those parts that should be analysed as inputs to the
system, those that are the outputs from the system, and
those that are actually implementing the cognition. We do
the same thing with computers running programs: there is
a causal interaction with the world that can be treated as
input, there is processing internal to the computer, and
