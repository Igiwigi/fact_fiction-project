The peculiar organism, here provisionally described under the
name WNematothallus (?) radiata, but suggesting comparison with Spongarium, is only
known from one exposure in the Temeside Shales. Actinophyllum has only been
found in the Downton Sandstone of Perton quarry. Interesting as these fossils of
occasional occurrence are, the striking fact is the uniformity of the general assemblage
(Pachytheca, Cooksonia, Prototaxites, Nematothallus, walled spores) which always
accompanies them. This assemblage of plants occurs in numerous localities at the horizon of the
Bone-bed and the Downton Sandstone immediately above it. The plant-remains
have been collected and studied from the Saltwells inlier ; from Ludford Lane and
Downton Castle Bridge ; from Hagley Park; and from Perton, Tarrington, and
other exposures in the Woolhope inlier.
