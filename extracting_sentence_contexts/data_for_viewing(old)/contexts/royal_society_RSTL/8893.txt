to begin after the bell has received a number of shocks in snccession. I must also
state that it is almost certain to ensue upon slightly acidulating the water in which the
mutilated bell is suspended. 'The $hivering, if it begins under these circumstances,
will then continue for some time even after the bell is restored to normal sea-water.

$3. Chemical Stimulation.—Under this heading I have very little to say, for the
simple reason that the excitable tissxues of Medusz conform in every respect to the
rules which are followed by the neryo-muscular tissues of higher animals. Both the
severed locomotor centres and the mutilated swimming-organs, as well, I may add, as
8everal polypites and tentacles, resxpond to applications of various acids, solutions of
yarious metallic salts, alcohol, ether, glycerine, &c. It may here be stated that fresh
water is quickly fatal to Meduse, especially in the case of the naked-eyed group. This
latter fact has been previously observed by AGASSIZ.

$ 4. Thermal Stimulation.—For the present I reserve my observations relating to
this subject.

IV. SECTION,

$1. Amount of section which the contractile tissues of Medus@ will endure without
8ufering loss of their physiological continuity.—The extent to which the substance of
the swimming-organs of Meduse may be mutilated without undergoing destruction of
their physiological continuity is in the highest degree astonishing. Again taking Sars@
as a type of the naked-eyed division, I shall here Fig. 2.
describe two modes of section which are the most trying
