“spin ” in each of the two photographs, and both the forward velocity of the flame-
front and the helical velocity of the “ head ” of detonation were slightly
higher than the corresponding values observed with a moist 2GO + O, medium in
a tube of the same diameter under precisely the same conditions as the figures in
Table VII show. TasLe VII

Another point that should be mentioned, probably connected with the somewhat
faster forward speed of the flame, is that the “ spin” in a dry has proved to be more
stable than that in a moist 2CO + O, detonation, as will be shown later in dealing
with the influence of strong electric fields upon the phenomena. Taken asa whole, this section of our work proves that, contrary to what has been
thought hitherto, detonation in a moist 2CO + O, can be quickened and rendered
more stable by the total removal of moisture, a fact which constitutes another
weighty addition to the rapidly growing body of experimental evidence that
carbonic oxide is directly oxidized in flames, and that the presence of water vapour
(or the like) is not essential to its combustion. VIII—Errects or Successtve AppITIONs OF ELECTROLYTIC GAS UPON THE SPIN
