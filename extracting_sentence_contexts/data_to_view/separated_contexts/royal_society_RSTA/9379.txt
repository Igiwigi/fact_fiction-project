From the small diagrams in figs. 3 and 4, showing the paths
of the waves through the earth, it can be seen that the rays which strike the core leave
the focus at inclinations which are very nearly vertical. The times taken by these
waves differ from those of the corresponding rays of a normal earthquake, therefore,
by an amount which is practically constant at all the distances for which these phases
can be observed. The difference is, in fact, within one or two seconds of the time of
travel along the vertical path from the deep focus to the normal depth. By extra-
polating Knorrâ€™s table Professor TurNER} inferred that the times taken in travelling
vertically from a depth of 0:06 R to the normal depth are 46 sec. in the case of P
waves and 86 sec. in the case of S waves. To derive the times of the core waves
these values have been applied to the times for the corresponding waves of normal
earthquakes given by GurenserG.t The corrections are subtracted for direct
waves and added for those waves which undergo reflexion near the epicentre.
