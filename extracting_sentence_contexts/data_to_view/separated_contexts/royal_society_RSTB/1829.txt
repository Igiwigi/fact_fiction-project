The temperature chart below is that of corresponding readings each minute
of a thermometer in the oven. No marked effect occurs with a rise of at least 10°; with a rise to
38°—viz., of 20°--the response diminishes; with the subsequent fall of temperature the response
increases again. The record is given in illustration of the fact that the response of fresh nerve is not affected by slight
variations of temperature. The effects of considerable variations, as regards the character and sign

of the response, will be described and considered in connection with the detailed study of positive
and negative effects of excitation. N.B.—The actual magnitudes of excursions, e.g., in fig. 13, as compared with fig. 12, are of no account
as indicative of magnitudes of nerve-effects in terms of potential.
