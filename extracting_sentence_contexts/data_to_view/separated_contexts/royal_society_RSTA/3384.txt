The theory of the midparent for a considerable number of couplets approaches
closely that originally given by Francis Garon, except for extreme values of the
character, when the regression becomes rapidly smaller and ultimately vanishes. We thus see that a generalised theory of the pure gamete would be of very great
advantage if it could be accepted. It would lead to a system of inheritance in
randomly mating populations with non-differential fertility, which in its broad
features would be essentially the same as that which has been biometrically
developed not from theoretical hypotheses, but from the statistical description of
observed facts in populations. Unfortunately, however, when we come to the actual numerical values for the
coefticients of heredity deducible from such a theory of the pure gamete, they do not
accord with observation. They diverge in two ways:
