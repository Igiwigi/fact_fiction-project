The longitudinal, transverse and rectangular patterns may all be seen in the sky
in cloud formations. Photographs of these clouds have been published by WaLkur and
others. In these publications there has been no reference made to the fact that
the square pattern is at times placed diagonally to the shear. I have seen the
pattern in the sky associated closely with transverse rolls and disposed diagonally to
them, but unfortunately a photograph taken of the cloud was not very satisfactory. The square pattern is often seen in a lenticular cloud bank, as shown by CuarKE,*
arranged with the diagonals along the long axis of the bank.
