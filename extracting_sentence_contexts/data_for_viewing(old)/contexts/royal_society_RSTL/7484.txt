Fvrmation or in that of the superimaginary transformation can we have an imaginary
transformation leading to a real equation.

and this will be a real equation if some power &” of & (p not greater than n) be real,
and if the equation (a, . .z, y)"=0 contain only terms wherein the index of x (or that
of y) is a multiple of p. Assuming that it is the index of y which is a multiple, the
form of the equation is in fact a*(a?, y”)"=0, (n=mp+e), and the transformed equation
is X*(4A”X”, Y”)"=0, which is a real equation.

325. 1t is to be observed that if p be odd, then writing &”=K (K real) and taking ]
the real p-th root of K, then the very same transformed equation would be obtained
the real transformation & : y into #X : Y ; 80 that the equation obtained by the imagi
transformation, being also obtainable by a real transformation, has the 8ame cha
as the original equation. |

326. Similarly if p be even, if K be real and poxitive, the equation &”=K has a real root
