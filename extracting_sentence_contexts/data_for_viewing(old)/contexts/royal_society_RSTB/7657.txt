The carotid rete

In the species examined in this investigation the presence of a well-developed carotid
rete was associated with the non-persistence of an internal carotid artery or with a
degenerating internal carotid artery. In man and in the rabbit, where the internal
carotid artery is present in adult life, no carotid rete exists, but in the dog, which has
a relatively large internal carotid artery, a rudimentary rete can be identified. In the

goat, sheep and pig no trace of an internal carotid artery was found proximal to the rete,
notwithstanding the fact that the specimens included foetal (near-term) sheep and some
new-born pigs. The casts of the vessels of the cat showed in no case an internal carotid
artery, but a fibrous cord running from the common carotid artery to the tympanic bulla
was observed in dissected specimens. Davis & Story (1943) state that this degenerating
vessel has a lumen for only the first two weeks of post-natal life. The only specimen of Bos
taurus which we examined was a calf of about four months old and this showed a complete
internal carotid artery, but Tandler (1899) found that in adult life this vessel no longer
remained.

Although the carotid rete was found to be an essentially similar structure in the various
types of animal, namely, a compact plexus of intertwined arterial vessels, the retia of
different species showed certain differences in their characteristic features. One of the
most important of these was the different situation of the rete in the cat as compared with
