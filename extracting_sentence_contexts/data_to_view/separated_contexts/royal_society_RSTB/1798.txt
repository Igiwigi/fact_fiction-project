46, 47, cells marked Â«), the sorus thus beginning
to assume its characteristic form. It might already be concluded, from fig. 46, that
there is no strict regularity of segmentation of the cells on either side of the median
line, as seen in transverse section of the sorus; but this fact is still more apparent in
a tangential section of the pinnule (fig. 47), in which the young sorus is seen in ground
plan. In the stage there represented it is impossible to recognise with certainty which
cells will ultimately give rise to the essential part of the sporangia, and which will
form the sterile septa; all appear alike as regards contents, and equally indefinite as
regards their segmentation. Similar results are obtained from a section longitudinaliy
through the region where the sporangia will arise (fig.
