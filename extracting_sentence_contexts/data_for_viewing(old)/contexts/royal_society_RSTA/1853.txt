than focusing on individual elements, and how their orbitals are occupied, the differentiating
electron is an important feature. Consequently, there still seems to be a need to derive this rule
from first principles as first suggested by Lowdin, even if the significance of the rule appears to
have changed somewhat.

9. Group 3

Another topic which has attracted a good deal of attention and which concerns possible
improvements to the periodic table in a very direct way is the current debate over the composition
of group 3Â°. Whereas the majority of textbook and other periodic tables in the 18-column format
show the elements of this group as scandium, yttrium, lanthanum and actinium, a significant
number of more recent tables feature the last two elements as lutetium and lawrencium instead.
If one considers this question within the context of a 32-column representation, there are in fact
four options. These options are shown in figures 10-13 inclusive. In the tables shown in figures 10
and 11, group 3 is shown as containing either Sc, Y, La and Ac or Sc, Y, Lu and Lr.

The second option is clearly preferable since it is the only one of these two tables that maintains
an increasing order of atomic number across every single-period length. In fact the table shown
in figure 11 has not appeared in print, as far as this author is aware, presumably because of the
anomalies that it would imply regarding increasing atomic number.

This is another case for which thinking about a 32-column table if not actually adopting the
longer format can be useful. Part of the reason why group 3 has traditionally been regarded as
consisting of Sc, Y, La and Ac is due to the predominance, not to say virtual monopoly, that the
