HANKEL, in his posthumous paper,* proved the formula

in the notation of hypergeometric functions, when » is an integer. ‘This function can
be recognised at once as proportional to our function q, (c/a). In fact, the formula may
be written as

qn(£) = (yf e-"J,,,(ha)AdA, . . «es (14)

and is proved by direct expansion of the Bessel function, if c>a. The resulting
hypergeometric function is then a convergent series.
