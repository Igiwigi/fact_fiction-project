Baltic. Whatever doubts, therefore, may hang over the causes which brought the hut
into the extraordinary position in which it was discoyered, it is impossible to reflect
on this and the other facts brought to light during the excavation of the Sidertelje
canal, without being convinced that very important moyements have taken place in the
land and the bed of the sea since the Baltic was inhabited by the existing Testacea,
and even since the sea was navigated by vessels, and this country inhabited by man.

In regard to the shells, I may observe that the Mya arenaria is the only one found
by me in great abundance in any part of the Baltic which I did not see among the
fossi]s of any of the localities already mentioned, or those afterwards to be alluded
to, further to the north. But this shell does not, I believe, extend s0 far north in the
Gulf of Bothnia as S6dertelje; I could not find it eyen at Calmar, and further south,
at Solvitzborg, it was rare, and of very small size. The analogy, in fact, of the fossil
shells to those now living in the Bothnian Gulf is most complete : the shells are the
same $pecies, partly freshwater and partly marine, the species taken collectively be-
ing few in number, and the marine attaining a smaller average size than in the
ocean, where the water is more salt. 'The Tellina Baltica is everywhere in great
abundance. Hence we may conclude, that since the time when an inland sea of
brackish water, like the Baltic, existed in the North of Europe, considerable fluctua-
tions in the position of land and sea have taken place; a conelusion to which I
shall revert in the sequel,

'The elevated position of the marine shells around S6dertele prepares us to expect
Similar deposits scattered far and wide over the valleys bordering the yarious branches
of Lake Maeler. Accordingly, in examining the country about forty-five miles north-
