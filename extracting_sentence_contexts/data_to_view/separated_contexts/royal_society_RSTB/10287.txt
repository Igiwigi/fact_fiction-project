Because the signal is produced constitutively, its
environmental concentration approximately scales with the
density of producing cells [15,83]. While quorum sensing is

generally sufficient to ensure induction is coordinated among
cells of the same species, it would not allow finer coordination
within species. A possible solution to this problem lies in the
fact that B. subtilis and S. pneumoniae are polymorphic for the
peptide signals they produce (called pherotypes) [84,85], and
there is no apparent cross-talk between a given peptide and
non-cognate receptors [86]. In S. pneumoniae, several groups
have argued that this type of polymorphism could permit
transformation to occur preferentially among cells expressing
the same phenotype—much like bacterial mating types,
although current results on this issue are mixed [84,87]. By using ecological proximity and quorum-sensing
systems to estimate cell density, bacteria can regulate compe-
tence so that it is only turned on when cells are surrounded
by individuals of the same species.
