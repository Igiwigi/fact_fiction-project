The former phenomena have been considered
(1320. 1338.) ; it is the latter which have now to be revised, and used as a test of the
proposed theory of induction.

1345. The theory assumes, that the particles of the dielectric (now an electrolyte)
are in the first instance brought, by ordinary inductive action, into a polarized state,
and raised to a certain degree of tension or intensity before discharge commences ;
the inductive state being, in fact, a necessary preliminary to discharge. By taking
advantage of those circumstances which bear upon the point, it is not difficult to in-
crease the tension indicative of this state of induction, and 80 make the state itself
more evident. Thus, if distilled water be employed, and a long narrow portion of it
placed between the electrodes of a powerful voltaic battery, we have at once indica-
tions of the intensity which can be sustained at these electrodes by the inductive ac-
tion through the water as a dielectric, for parks may be obtained, gold leayes di-
verged, and Leyden bottles charged at their wires.
