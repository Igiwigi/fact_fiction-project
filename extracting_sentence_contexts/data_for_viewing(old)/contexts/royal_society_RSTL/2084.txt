48 DR. FARADAY'S EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCHES IN ELECTRICITY.

cessive discharges rather resemble those of a yoltaic arrangement, intermitting
in its action, than those of a Leyden apparatus, charged and discharged many
times in succession, In reality, however, there is no philosophical difference be-
tween these two cages.

360. The general conclusion which must, I think, be drawn from this col-
lection of facts is, that electricity, whatever may be its $0urce, is identical in its
nature. The phenomena in the five kinds or species quoted, differ not in their
character, but only in degree; and in that respect vary in proportion to the
variable circumstances of quantity and intensity * which can at pleasure be
made to change in almost any one of the kinds of electricity, as much as it
does between one kind and another.
