The amplitude does not, however, become infinite owing to the pro-
pagation of energy away from the source of the disturbance. c,, c, and c, show similar
resonance peaks when oh//, = 2-7, 4:1 and 6-3 respectively. There are also maxima in the
earlier parts of each curve. This might be expected from the fact that the group-velocity
curve has two stationary values (Press & Ewing 1948). These do not, however, coincide

exactly with the maxima in figure 2. We define W? to be the sum of the joer moduli of the terms in equation (183).
