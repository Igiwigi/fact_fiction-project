(See Plate 78, fig. 11.) Here each bundle must pass throi
internodes, instead of one, before joining on to the trace of another leaf. T
tangential sections, including those of Caleamopitus, similar variations oceurt

We may sum up the facts considered as follows :â€”The bundle-system of @
bears a general resemblance to that of Hquisetum. A single leaf-trace e
stem from each leaf, and passes vertically downwards to the next node. simplest cases the bundle here forks, its two branches attaching themselves tot
nating bundles which enter the stem at this node.
