The drift D of the spot in the time T is defined as
D = 4(4,—4s), (50)

ince the time between readings d, and d, is 2T.
In practice it is convenient to test the performance of the magnetometer in the first instance
y omitting altogether the signal, that is, in the case above, the movement of the specimen.

Then when n is large, the algebraic mean value ‘A of all the deflexions will be nearly zero,
Sand the arithmetic mean A of all the n deflexions in the absence of a signal will be used to
easure the accuracy ofa single reading. It is found in practice, as would be expected, that
gprovided the drift rate does not change too fast the calculated deflexions are independent
a f the drift; in fact, the possibility of obtaining a high sensitivity with the instrument
depends essentially on the fact that significant values of A can be obtained in the presence
Eof a drift D which may be many times greater than the average error A of a single reading.
It is found that the mean error A of a deflexion tends to be large (a) when magnetic

Bdisturbances, as measured by the fluxgate recorder, are large, (b) when there is a strong

wind, (c) when it is raining.
