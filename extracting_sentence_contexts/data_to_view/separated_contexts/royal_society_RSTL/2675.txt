What I have done is strikingly illustrated by the late investigations of Dr. Farapay. It is more than twenty years since I found that voltaic electricity is capable of all the
functions of the nervous influence; it now appears from the facts, on which he has
founded his doctrine of electro-chemical equivalents, that electricity is the agent in all
chemical processes*. According to the inferences of Dr. Faravar therefore, the ex-
periments, which prove that the nervous influence is the agent in the functions we
have been considering, all of which we have seen are chemical processes, are sufficient
to prove its electric nature; and we are now also, on the other hand, furnished with
direct proof that the brain is capable of collecting and applying, even according to
the dictates of the will, the electric power.
