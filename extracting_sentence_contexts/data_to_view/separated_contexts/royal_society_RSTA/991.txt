If we consider that, as demonstrated in previous works [31,32], in fibre-like suspensions the
particle-particle solid friction considerably hinders the relative movement of particles inside
bundle-like aggregates. In addition, as predicted in [30], when the particles are functionalized
with large molecules, imparting electro-steric repulsion between the particles, the viscosity values
reached in the shear-thickening region are considerably reduced. In fact, this decrease is evident
if we compare the maximum viscosities reached in the 7% and 10% SM suspensions (9.5 mPa s~!
and 10.7mPas™!, respectively) with those in SMA suspensions (6.9mPas~! and 9.6mPas~1,
respectively). The next question arises about the strength of the MR effect in SM and SMA suspensions
with 10% w/v concentration. For this purpose, the corresponding rheograms (see electronic
supplementary material, figure S3) were obtained in the range of low—moderate magnetic fields.
