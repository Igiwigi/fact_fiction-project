Thus we see it supervene in those who have been long exposed to the irri-
tations which attend the more serious and confirmed cases of indigestion or
long-continued canses of anxiety, particularly in gouty habits, in which there
is often a great tendency to debility in the vital organs; and we readily per-
ceive from what has been said, why apoplexy from such causes is s0 generally
fatal. The powers both of the neryous and circulating systems are undermined,
and with them the secreting and other assimilating processes which depend on
them. The powers which ought to respond to our remedies have failed. Our
efforts therefore are for the most part equally unavailing in restoring either the
sensibility or the powers of circulation, and both are necessary to recovery.

From a review of the whole of the facts which have been laid before the
Society, it appears,â€”

That in the brain and spinal marrow alone reside the active parts of the
neryous system.

That the law of excitement in the parts of these organs, which are associated
with the nerves of sensation and voluntary motion, is uniform excitement fol-
lowed by proportional exhaustion, which, when it takes place to such a degree
as to suspend their usual functions, constitutes sleep ; all degrees of exhaustion
which do not extend beyond them and the parts associated with them, being
consistent with health.
