systems. Indeed, acute hypotensive episodes are among the most critical events in these units,
and effective, prompt prediction is critical to prevent shock and its potential multi-organ
complications, including death. Advanced HRV measurements with high statistical power could
provide this critical additional information for accurate, individualized predictions of high-
risk states, and in an ideal world, allow for automated interventions to restore autonomic and
cardiovascular stability.

Continued advances in affordable wearable technology will also lead to enhancements in
the impact of HRV complexity studies. Due to the use of proxy techniques and the nature
of the devices themselves, HRV evaluation and validation will also require improvements in
signal processing analytics that can extract diagnostic information from the elevated levels of
noise present during ambulatory acquisition, allowing for the monitoring of interventions and
the prediction of clinical events, as demonstrated in figure 11. In fact, while current gold-
standard measures of HRV rely on the ECG to quantify heartbeat time intervals, some wearable
cardiovascular monitoring devices rely on optical measures (photoplethysmography or pulse
oximetry) of the mechanical blood pulse signal. To this end, large-scale data acquisition initiatives
have already begun for cardiovascular healthcare, e.g. the Apple Heart Study (https://med.
stanford.edu/appleheartstudy.html). Understanding how multi-faceted properties of disease are
reflected in data gathered from HRV complex measurements will lead to discernment of health
from disease and assessment of severity.

(b) Exploiting cardiovascular complexity at a brain—body level

To overcome the specificity issues noted above, future HRV research may need to redefine
and exploit complexity assessments at a brain—body level. To this end, multivariate complexity
