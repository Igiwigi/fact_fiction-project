If it were the direct cause it would
follow that a great increase would result from the administration of slightly larger
quantities, which is not the case ; the duration of subnormal pressure, though greater
when larger quantities of the nitrites are administered, falls very far short of being
proportionately greater. That the quantity of nitroxyl is not the only factor in the
permanence of this physiological effect is clear from the circumstance that, whilst
iso-primary amyl nitrite represents almost exactly the same amount of nitroxyl as
tertiary amy] nitrite, the latter is much the more powerful compound. The fact that
the most volatile and diffusible nitrites (methyl and ethyl nitrites) act for the longest

The nitrites of high molecular weight would less readily enter into combination, ar
being more unstable, would be more quickly decomposed ; and thus these effects wor
last for a shorter time than those of the more stable compounds of lower mole
weight. It is not possible in the present state of our knowledge to offer a complete chemic
explanation of the peculiarities in the behaviour of these nitrites in reducing blooi
pressure. There can, however, be no doubt that whilst the causes which lead
the acceleration of the pulse and the reduction of pressure are essentially the sam
those which control the duration of subnormal pressure are distinct ; the first-mentione
effects are associated with molecular instability, whilst the latter effect, in its intenses
form, is produced by the most stable compounds of the series.
