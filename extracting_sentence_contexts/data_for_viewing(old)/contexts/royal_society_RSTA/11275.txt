When the symbol was invariably = the enumerating function found was

wherein (s) denotes 1 — «’. If we place these factors at the successive points of the
line we obtain a diagrammatic exhibition of the generating function, viz. :—

a simple fact that the following investigation shows to be fundamental in idea,

Art. 82. I pass on to consider partitions into parts placed at the points of a two-
dimensional lattice.

For clearness take the elementary case of four parts placed at the points of a

square,
