It is to be observed that the intermediary integral or integrals thus obtained
cannot be regarded as intermediary integrals of the original equation in the ordinary
sense of the phrase, for each of them involves two arbitrary functions. But they
are intermediary for the respective compatible equations: each of them involves one
arbitrary function more than occurs in the compatible equation. The result mani-
festly does not imply that the original equation possesses any intermediary integral ;
in fact, the assumption throughout our investigations has been that no proper
intermediary integral exists.

25. A methodt has been given elsewhere for constructing the intermediary integral. In effect, it amounts to the use of the conditions which must be satisfied in order
that the derivatives

any + hin + Gy, + Ue = 0
hy + Dim + fitn + vy = 0
gia + film + ch + u. = 0

from the supposed integral
u (i,m, n, v, @, y, 2) = 0

shall cause the compatible equation
O(a... h, 1m, n, v, 2, y, z)=0
to be satisfied without regard to the values of the differential coefficients of v of

* The explanations will be seen to apply, mutatis mutandis, to other cases of the second order, and
indeed to cases of any order, when compatible equations are known.
