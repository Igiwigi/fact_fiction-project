It does seem strange that, having originally had
in his possession a complete slab like that of SrenzeL, ScuENK should have given away
to Lance the more important half, which included the stem. Had Scuenx figured
the entire slab, his sketch would have been so similar to Srenzev’s figure at the adjoining
fragment, that the relation of the two specimens with each other would not so long have
remained obscure. We need not go into details over the structural facts described by Scuunk and
SrenzeL. STENzEL’s fig. 38, Plate IV, is a remarkably good sketch of the upper face
of the slab (level 31 mm. in text-fig. 1); he correctly draws the outline of the leaf-
bearing stem with the decurrent leaf-bases, including the fragments of the stele marked
sg, sq’ in his figure. The leaf-traces in the cortex are merely shown as dots.+ In one of
the free petioles{t he shows a strand with a slight adaxial curvature ; this is an error,
for none of the leaf-strands ever show any curvature.
