of fluid, before the appearance in it of the permanent corpuscles, and before the deve-
lopment of the tracheal system, undergoes the process of atration in accordance with
the plan on which this great function is performed under the chylaqueous type. Less
complexly organized than the blood-proper, it demands no special apparatus for its
exposure to the aGrating medium. As it rolls in the general cavity of the body, it
undergoes adequately this vital change. These observations require very little to be
modified to render them true of all insect-larvee. Thus, then, there exists in the
Myriapod *a circulating fluid” anterior to the trae-blood, which the latter gradually
supersedes, and *a respiration' which precedes that which snbsequently devolves
upon the tracheal system*,

In the adult Myriapod the blood is colourless and richly corpusculated. The cor-
puscles are perfectly destitute of colour. This fact is true of the fluid systems of all
articulated animals without a single exception. Wherefore this universal absence in
the fluids of a pigment-producing faculty? The floating bodies of the blood in the
adult Myriapod are regularly and determinately organized. They are nearly the
same in the Tulidz as in the Scolopendrz, the highest and the Jowest orders. They
present under the microscope, in a fresh drop of blood, three leading varieties :—Ist, a
large pellacid nucleus surrounded by a few granules (Plate XXXII. fig. 38) ; 2nd, the
orbicular, in which the granules have grown in number, almost concealing the nucleus
(fig. 39); and 3rdly, the ovoid or oat-shaped, in which the nucleus has reappeared
(fig. 40). In none of these bodies is it possible under any mancenvre to detect the
presence of a cell-capsule. The molecules surrounding the nucleus seem rather to be
drawn to the latter by a mysterious centripetal power, than embraced by an invo-
lacrum. These bodies, when they burst in the field of the microscope, febrillate,
