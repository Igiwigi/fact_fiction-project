Roots of Lyginodendron with a tetrarch cylinder are, it is true, well

1294, 1915, 1915 A, 1915 G, and 1915 H.

own, but in these the primary wood is of small extent and has much less prominent
xylem angles (cf: Plate 20, photograph 14). Another distinction consists in the
fact that the primary wood in the roots of Zyginodendron, when of comparable extent
to that of the roots in question, contains a larger amount of conjunctive parenchyma. The difference in anatomical] “habit” between the roots which we are describing
and those of Zyginodendron is well marked, though easier to see than to describe
(cf. photographs and figures of Lyginodendron roots with fig. 27). The cambium and phloém are exquisitely preserved in this and other specimens,
The secondary thickening took place with remarkable regularity, the bands of
secondary wood being strictly limited to the regions opposite the phloém.
