the coalescence of the leaf cushions which stand vertically one above another.”
Also that “an indication of the separate leaf cushions which have united to form
the ribs is very often shown in the serpentine course of the furrows, which is due
to the circumstance that the cushions are broadest at the insertion of the leaves
and narrow downwards, so that every leaf-scar lies on a knot-like swelling of
the rib.”

RenAvuttt says “dans les Sigillaires cannelées, Favularia tessellata, Fav. Saulii,
les cdtes longitudinales dues 4 de vraies cannelures sont trés appréciables sur la
surface interne de la zone subéreuse.”

Scort,t in his “Studies,” concludes that “the ribs may be looked upon as
representing a series of fused leaf-bases, a view which is supported by the fact that
the ligular pit, which must clearly have belonged to the leaf-base, is placed on the rib
immediately above each leaf-scar.”

The structure of the ribs of a Sigillarian stem of the Rhytidolepis section with
distant leaf-scars, such as Sigillaria scutellata, Bronen., is fully illustrated by the
material described here. The leaf-bases, consisting of parenchymatous elements,
form, in the uncrushed condition, bracket-shaped projections from the surface of the
rib, the sloping shelf of the bracket bearing the leaf-scar and also the ligular pit
(see text-fig. on next page). Apart from the projecting leaf-bases the greater portion
of the thickness of the rib is formed by the phelloderm. External to the phelloderm,
both in the case of the ribs and the grooves between them, a thin layer of primary
cortical tissue persists. This forms the actual surface of the rib both above and
