ABSORPTION PRODUCED BY FLUORESCENCE. 103

If there is no change of absorption (#) ought to be of the same intensity as ()).
As a matter of fact, it was always found to be much denser in the negative. The
intensities of (b) and (d) were never exactly equal, but, on the contrary, (d) was
always darker than (b). Now, the width of the slit for (¢) was double that for (b),
but the exposure was half, which shows that if we double the intensity of the light
to which a photographie plate is exposed, the exposure must be less than half in
order that the same effect should be produced. In other words, the photographic
effect is not proportional to the intensity and to the time conjointly.

The actual width of the slits and the exposures in one particular instance were as
follows :—
