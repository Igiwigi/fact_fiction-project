They are also
useful, from projecting into the ventricular cavity, in reducing the blood to a state of
S quiescence during the diastole. During the systole they act as spiral lavers, and scoop
© the blood out of the interior of the ventricle by communicating to it a gliding spiral
= movement. S Situated between the musculi papillares, and, in fact, occupying the spiral interspaces
© or hollows occasioned by their projecting into the ventricular cavity, are the carnew
5 columnz. The carne column, like the musculi papillares, proceed in a spiral nearly
5 vertical direction from right to left upwards. They are more developed in some
Z instances than in others.
