The culture medium used was, as before,
the water from a heated tank containing living Lepidosiren paradowa fed daily with
Anodonta. The water in this tank, which is changed weekly, contains ‘a large
amount of organic matter and infusoria, and has proved “an excellent medium for
cultivating Cladocera of various species. A large jar of water was taken from this
tank on alternate days and strained through linen to avoid all chance of infection
with foreign strains of Simocephalus (though, as a matter of fact, none were ever
observed in the tank). The jar of tank-water was then brought into the room in
which the breeding tubes were kept, in order to bring it to the same temperature,
and on the day following it was used to renew the water in the breeding tubes. The
Simocephalus was picked out of the tube with a pipette, the water poured away, and
then the animal returned and fresh water added.
