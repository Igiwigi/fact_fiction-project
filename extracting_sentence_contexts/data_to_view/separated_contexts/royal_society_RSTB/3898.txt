Sparganum cortex is preserved both on the stem and on the leaf-base. The structure is manifestly of the Kalymma type, just as in the specimens described
by Grar zu Soums-Lausacu. The specimen in fact shows a Calamopitys stem in
connection with a Kalymma leaf-base and thus affords fresh evidence of the connection
of these fossils,

It is rather unfortunate that no bundles are seen, in this specimen, immediately
outside the wood, so that we cannot tell how long they retained their secondary wood. The best specimens of Kalymma in our material are detached from the stem and will
be considered separately. We may now sum up our results as to Calamopitys americana and briefly compare
it with other species.
