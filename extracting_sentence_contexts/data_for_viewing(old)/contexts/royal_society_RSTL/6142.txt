172. Returning to the linear equation and expressing the coefficients, the equation is

(5, 9, ZLz, y, 2)=0,

Er+1+{&=0;

and we say as a definition, that the coordinates (line-coordinates) of this line are (& n, T).

173. But the same equation, considering (x, y, 2) as constant coefficients, and (Ee)
as line-coordinates, is the equation of a point, viz. the point which is the locus (envelope)
of all those points the coordinates of which satisfy the equation in question ; and swch
point is precisely the point, the coordinates (point-coordinates) of which are (z, y, 2).
In fact, if (E, Â», L) are considered as variable parameters connected by the equation
wH1y +&=0, then taking (X, Y, Z) as current point-coordinates, the equation
$X+1Y+ZZ=0 is satisfied by writing (x, y, 2) for (X, Y, Z); or the several lines the
coordinates whereof are (E, 1, 7), all pass through the point (a, y, 2).

174, Hence recapitulating, the equation

(5, n, 2X, y, 2)=0,
or
E&r+ny+& =0,

2) as current point-coordinates,
