3. Destruction of the angular gyrus (Exps. 5 and 6).

4, Destruction of the pulvinar thalami (Exp. 7).

5, Extirpation of the frontal lobes along with destruction of the angular gyri
(Exp. 8).

It has not been considered necessary to give a detailed account of the symptoms
in all the experiments in which operations were performed upon the visual system.
In many cases they were merely corroborative of facts now well known, and which
do not require repetition.

But as, on some points, there is a want of harmony among the results obtained by
different experimenters, it has been deemed advisable to describe those which we
have obtained in this research, such, for instance, as the phenomena following
removal of the angular gyrus.

This convolution was destroyed in two cases. In both animals the removal was
complete; but in neither, as demonstrated by post-mortem examination, were the
subjacent optic radiations involved.

Tn both the convolution was destroyed upon the left side. In neither was there
