Assuming homology, for the sake of argument, in our adoption of new variants, or ignoring the fact that new variants,

case the communal display was eventually elaborated by arising from mutation, are initially always rare. A second point is that although evolution involves non-
adaptive mechanisms such as random mutation and drift, a
series of non-adaptive genetic changes leading to a complex
new phenotype is exceedingly improbable. To establish the
plausibility of a scenario for a trait shared by all humans, we
thus have to show that each new variant conveys a fitness
advantage both when it is rare in a population and when it
has already become quite common.
