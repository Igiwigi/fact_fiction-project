hyperbolic metric has constant negative sectional curvature (not just negative scalar curvature).
Nevertheless, the asymptotic solutions still lie in a small neighbourhood of the backgrounds (5.1)
and (5.2). This in other words implies a Lyapunov stability of the solutions described by (5.1)
and (5.2). This stability result seems to be unsatisfactory in view of the information provided
by the monotonic decay of the weak Lyapunov functional where one would expect an asymptotic
stability of these background solutions. However, we are not able to claim that the monotonically
decaying Lyapunov functional ever attains its infimum even asymptotically. This is indeed an
open problem of large data long time existence associated with the Einstein flow and closely
related to the Cosmic Censorship Conjecture. But if the Lyapunov functional ever did achieve its
infimum then the infimum would correspond to the background solution that is characterized by
the hyperbolic manifold as its spatial component. On the other hand, using the currently available
techniques, we can only establish a Lyapunov stability, which does not prove (or disprove) the
fact that these background solutions are asymptotically stable. These open issues require careful
investigation and should be addressed in future studies.

Appendix A. Negative Yamabe manifolds

In this section, we shall focus attention on the subset of these 3-manifolds of the so-called
negative Yamabe type. Even although the monotonicity and the asymptotic behaviour of the
