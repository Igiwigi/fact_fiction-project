A #iiany homogeneous equations ro be 86lved as' there are constants to be determined ;
accordingly, with the exception of one arbitrary factor which enters into the solution,
the problem'is definite; and if it be farther agreed that the quantities entering into
the'86lution/shall be of the Towest possible dimensions'in' respect of the coefficients of
F'and's, and also of the lowest nitmerical denomination, then the problem (save as to
the algebraical 8ign' of plus or minus) becomes absolutely determinate, and we can
as8ign the numbers of the dimensons' for the respective residues and 8yzygetic mul-
tipliers.” The residnes given by the method of successive division are easily seen not
