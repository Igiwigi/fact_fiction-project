Several exceptions to the rule, notably in the case of methyl nitrite, which occupies

a higher position as a pressure reducing agent than it does as a pulse accelerator.

634 PROFESSORS J. T. CASH AND W. R. DUNSTAN ON THE If correction is made for the difference in the densities of these liquids the positic
of some of the nitrites of small molecular weight would probably be lowered, and
nearer approximation obtained to an order corresponding with that of the homologe
series. It is, however, remarkable that in most cases an increase in the quantity of nitrit
administered does not lead to tke corresponding increase in the reduction of bl
pressure which we should expect, in fact the relatively powerful action of sm
quantities of these compounds is very extraordinary. The differences in the boiling-points of the liquids do not seem to exercise am
important influence on the extent to which they reduce blood-pressure. Those boilin
at lower temperatures do not act more rapidly.
