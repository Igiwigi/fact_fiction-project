Progress in synthetic organic chemistry has increased the range of possible explosives to
such an extent that some more scientific information on sensitiveness would be most useful
in orienting future developments. Various developments in the experimental knowledge
on the subject are discussed in the following sections. The mechanism of initiation of detonation

In discussing the initiation of detonation in a quiescent explosive it is desirable to keep
in view certain facts about the mechanism of propagation, once detonation has been started. The linear velocity of propagation in solids and liquids ranges from 3000 to 8000 m./sec.,
so that the front of the chemical reaction traverses a layer of quiescent molecules—say
3 Angstrom units—in not more than 10~'’sec. At ordinary temperatures, the frequency of
molecular collision in a liquid is only about 3x10!" per sec.
