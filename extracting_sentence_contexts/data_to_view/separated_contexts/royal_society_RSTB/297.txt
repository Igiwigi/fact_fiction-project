Under these circumstances, the auricular contraction
may influence the electrical reading, which must not therefore be attributed to the
ventricle alone; an electrometer reading in reality due to auricular followed by
ventricular negativity might be taken to represent basal followed by apical negativity
of the ventricle alone. If the auricles should be beating with a more rapid rhythm
than the ventricles (as commonly occurs in the moribund Mammulian heart), there will
obviously be no danger of confusing auricular with basal negativity ; but, if auricles
and ventricles should be beating in regular sequence, it is necessary to be on guard

against this possibility, which will be particularly misleading if the true basal phase
should happen to be weak or absent, but which may also confuse the reading of a
normal ventricular variation, An illustration of this point is given in the note to
ixperiment 1. The origin of the excitatory process can be experimentally determined.â€”-Apart from
the fact that true stimuli are capable of starting the excitatory process from any part
of the ventricle, I have found that it is possible by local alteration of temperature to
determine the origin of a series of contractions. An excised ventricle which has
become quiescent can be made to resume rhythmic contractions by raising its tem-
perature. Ifthis be done in such a way that the apex is more warmed than the base,
the diphasic variation at each contraction has directions denoting origin at apex; if in
such a way that the base is more warmed than the apex, the directions of the diphasic
variation indicate origin at base.
