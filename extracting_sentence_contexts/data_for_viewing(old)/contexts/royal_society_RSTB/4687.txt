relatively primitive stage of evolution is represented. As phylogenetic specialisation
proceeds, elaboration of structure progressively affects the younger ambulacral plates,
until in extreme cases it is impressed upon them at their very inception. The single
primary on the peristome margin of Salenocidaris is in no way antagonistic to this
view. It has retained its relatively primitive simplicity because it has been preserved
from crushing by the perignathic process (which is largely based upon it), and has
had no reason for combination owing to the absence of large tubercles on its outer

surface. The succeeding plates have been jammed against its immovable apicad
margin, and support the largest tubercles found in the ambulacrum. Such seems
equally to be the interpretation of the orad plates of Heterocentrotus described above.

As a result of the foregoing considerations, and of facts that will appear during

detailed description of the Holectypoid ambulacrum, I am inclined to doubt the
applicability of the “law of localized stages” to the separate plates of any but
* Perischoechinoid” or Cidaroid forms. Nevertheless, in respect of the composition of
compound plates in the Diademoida, the principle seems well established and plainly
illustrated. The number of plates in a compound is determined once for all when
all plates in the column (or part of a column) have become combined. No subsequent
development can detach components from one compound to add them to another ;
so that, unless the (clearly mistaken) view of A, AGassiz (1874, p. 642) is adopted,
