were all intact at the time of burial whilst all other tissues had been destroyed, so that
in dorso-ventrally flattened specimens the pharyngo-branchials rest directly on the
cerato-branchials, a disposition which adds greatly to the difficulties of interpretation.
The structures are, however, quite perfectly preserved, chiefly as moulds from which the
remaining fragments of bone can be removed by treatment with dilute hydrochloric acid.

Res in his elaborate description of Acanthodes gave an account of the neural cranium
based on such part of it as could be seen in complete heads. According to his descrip-
tion it was composed essentially of two bony elements, a large thin shield dorsally and
a remarkable T-shaped bone perforated by a large foramen lying on the ventral
surface in the orbital region; this he called the trabecular. I am fortunate in that a
single specimen, P. 495, shows the entire isolated neural cranium so far as it was
ossified. Owing to the fact that a great deal of the side wall remained as cartilage, the
ventral elements of this brain case sank down until they came into contact with its
dorsal bones, but they are not otherwise displaced. The individual elements all consist
of thin sheets of bone surrounding cavities which still exist as such and were in life
certainly occupied by cartilage. The account that I give of them pays no attention
to the cartilaginous hollow, the whole bone being described as though it were solid,
or as if the description applied to the cast.

The base of the skull is composed of a series of three bones, the anterior and posterior
of which are much more massive than that which lies between them, and are to be
