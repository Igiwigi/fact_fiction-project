If H, were the only admissible alternative to Hg, it is evident that we should choose
from w,, Wg, Ws and w, that region in which the chance of a sample point falling, if H,
were true, is greatest ; that is to say the region in the diagram containing the greatest
number of the small circles forming the cluster round A,. This would be the region
W2, because for example,

P, (we) > P, (w,) or P, (W — we) < P, (W — %). This we do since in accepting Hy when the sample point lies in (W — wz), we shall be
accepting it when H, is, in fact, true, less often than if we used w,. We need indeed to
pick out from all possible regions for which Po (w) = «, that region, wy, for which P, (wo)
is a maximum and P, (W — wo) consequently a minimum; this region (or regions if
more than one satisfy the condition) we shall term the Best Critical Region for Hy
with regard to H,. There will be a family of such regions, each member corresponding
to a different value of «.
