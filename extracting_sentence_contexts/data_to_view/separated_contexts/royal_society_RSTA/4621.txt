If there is no solution inside, then all orbits connect the unstable fixed point on the circle to the
stable one. If |A/25| = 1 then there are no orbits connecting the circle with the interior of the disc. In view of the fact that |1| = |w| (see (5.11)), the upshot is that in all the cases obeying (7.4),
when the unit circle attracts trajectories, it follows that lim sup,_, ,, || =1 where w is related to
(5.1) by (5.6). Consequently, there is unbounded growth of the inner ellipse. Indeed, from the
conservation of Aj and from (5.7) it follows that lim sup,_, ., |Wi| = 09, and that means, in view of
(3.3), that the sum of lengths of semi-axes of the inner ellipse diverges. a
