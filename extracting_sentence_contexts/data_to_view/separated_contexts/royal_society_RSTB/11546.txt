Why is it so compelling that this patient was conscious? Monti et al. suggest a natural answer, characterizing her
responses as ‘willful’ communication. On the face of it at
least, the fact that the responses corresponded to correct
answers can be explained only if they were intentional actions,
reflecting a decision made on the basis of the instructions and
questions. That is evidence that the patient was conscious,

insofar as decisions of this kind require consciousness of the
basis for action. The suggestion that decisions of this kind require conscious-
ness can be fleshed out using some ideas from the philosophical
literature.
