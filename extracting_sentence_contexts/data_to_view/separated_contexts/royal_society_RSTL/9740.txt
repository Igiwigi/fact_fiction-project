Fach ridge is inserted into the main body of the wing, like a nail into a plank, with
a conical insertion consisting only of the molecular layer. The granular-basal part of
the wings forms a conical projection between each pair of molecular layers, and the pia
mater passes down between these, forming a double membrane which at the summit of
this conical process of the basal part divides into two, one accompanying each molecular
layer to the extremity of its insertion where ib disappears. We have thus a series of ridges in alternately reversed positions, occurring in fact
S in pairs back to back. Where the wings are comparatively straight, the only contact
Â© that the ridges have with their basal portion is by the insertion at one edge ; but
S where curves and foldings occur the ridges become more or less distorted, and may be
= in contact with those parts by the sides as well as by the edges. With regard
S to the minute structure of these ridges and the remainder of the wings we will begin
D with a consideration of the molecular layers.
