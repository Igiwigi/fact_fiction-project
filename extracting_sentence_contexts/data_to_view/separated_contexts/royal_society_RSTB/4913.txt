The first point which arises in considering these structures concerns their identificatior
as sporocarps. External similarity is certainly strong, but on maceration Hate failed
to extract either micro- or megaspore-membranes. Experience shows that when spores
are present, even in a fairly young condition, they can generally be extracted by macera-
tion, and the fact that Prof. Hate did not find traces of any is a serious difficulty to our
regarding these structures as sporocarps. He did, however, find traces of an “ inner
membrane,” as well as obtaining the cuticle of the outer wall, and states that “ it is not
certain that this layer represents a real epidermis, as the cuticle—though of a considerable
thickness—is too disintegrated to give a clear idea of its structure.’ No figures of this
inner cuticle layer are given, and here, again, it is possible that it represents fragments of
one or more megaspore membranes.
