These two specimens therefore of a substance prepared in the same way, both of
which would, according to the definition of WoLFry and STRECKER, pass for purpurine,
possessed a composition, which in the one case corresponded to a mixture of 1 equiy.
of alizarine and 3 equirs. of verantine, in the other case to a mixture of 3 equivs. of
alizarine and 1 equiy, of verantine. A till more manifest proof of the fact of purpurine
not being a substance of uniform composition, is derived from an examination of the
liquid from which these specimens were deposited. To the bright red liquid from
which the last was deposited, I added after filtration muriatic acid and boiled. A
yellow precipitate was produced, which was collected on a filter and washed. A small
quantity of it being dissolved in alcohol, the alcohol left on evaporation crystals of
apparently pure alizarine. Its analysis also showed that it consisted of alizarine
almost in a state of purity.
