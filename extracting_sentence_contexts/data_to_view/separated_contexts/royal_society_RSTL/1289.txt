PEARSON 01 expectorated Matter. 343

saline impregnations, particularly of the muriate of s0da, and
neutralized potash 80 great, that the exsiccated expectorated
$ubstance tasted very salt, and presently grew moist, or eyen
partially deliquesced; /but.the opaque ropy,or puriform matter
afforded. a much larger proportion of exsiccated residue, which
Was but slightly salt, and, generally only became soft; on ex-
Ppoxure to the air... This, property of growing. moist depends
upon the potash,

6. Each of the human fluids, according to. my experiments,
contain neutralized potash ; at least, this is the fact of the blood,
.dropsy fluid, pus of abscesses, and pus secreted without breach
of surface;, the fluid effused by vesicating: with cantharides;
the urine ; /and._ in course in the very abundant, secretion from
the nose by a. catarrh. The alkali being united to, oxide, of
animal matter in these fluids, it is easily demonstrable,

7. Although I think I have discovered many properties by
which expectorated Secretion may. be distinguished from ex-
pectorated pus, I shall not speak of them, on this occasion,
further than ;just to, observe that the saline impregnation of
pus, particularly that of potash, and muriate of soda 4s in very
much \less proportion than in expectorated secretion ; and
hence it does not become moist after exsiccation, on-exposure
to the air,

8: It has been, I believe, uniformly asserted, that the circu-
lating and secreted fluids are impregnated with, soda ; that.it
is especially in the, matter _secreted. by, the bronchial mem-
brane.
