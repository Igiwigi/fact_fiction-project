Further,
comparison of the orientation and the GOS maps clearly indicates that martensitic transformation
has occurred in the grains with higher misorientation gradient. It is believed that residual stress
present within a grain plays a key role here. It is corroborated by the fact that the tensile and
compressive nature of stress assists the martensitic formation by increasing the Ms in steel [27,28]. GOS maps also demonstrate misorientation accumulation in the austenite phase around the
martensites, because of shape change and increase in volume due to martensite transformation. Frequencies of martensite /austenite and martensite/martensite boundaries in figure 9e show
that misorientation cluster angles for austenite /martensite interfaces of C55 alloy present a broad
spectrum (28째-47째) compared to that of C23 alloy (42째-47째).
