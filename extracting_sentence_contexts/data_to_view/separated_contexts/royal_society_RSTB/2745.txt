Neuropteris schlehani, Alethopteris seri, and
Calamocladus chareformis ave unknown from the Lower Coal Measures, while Sigillaviu
tessellata and Neuropteris obliqua ave markedly more abundant in the Middle than
the Lower Coal Measures. The common occurrence of Sigillaria, a genus which reaches
its maximum in the Middle Coal Measures, and which is neither frequent nor
represented by many species on the lower horizon, adds confirmatory support to this
conclusion. This flora is further distinguished from that of the Upper Transition Series and the
Upper Coal Measures by the entire absence of certain genera or species, especially
Pecopteris and its allies, which are characteristic of those horizons, as well as by the
fact that many of the species described here are either entirely unknown from, or of
very rare occurrence in the higher beds. The main conclusion of this paper is, therefore, that the coal-bearing horizon in the
Upper Culm Measures, developed in the Bideford district, is equivalent to the Middle
Coal Measures in other British coalfields. VIL.
