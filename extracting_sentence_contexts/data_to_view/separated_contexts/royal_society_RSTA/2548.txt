Quite amazingly, many proofs in the later books, including Euclidâ€™s
proof of the infinitude of primes, are proofs even for us.

e Actually, even at the university level people rarely seriously contemplate the proofs they
are telling to their students in the elementary courses. Thus, until very recently most of
the proofs in undergraduate Analysis courses suffered from systematic delusions related
to the incorrect use of infinity, that survived from the early twentieth century. A crucial fact, used to establish the equivalence of continuity in terms of sequences and in terms
of neighbourhoods, is that any infinite set contains a countable subset. Here is the usual proof,
to which generations of students were exposed. Let X be an infinite set.
