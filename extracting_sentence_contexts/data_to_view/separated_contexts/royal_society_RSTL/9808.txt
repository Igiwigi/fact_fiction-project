Specimens of thymus treated in this way will, in most cases, show double staining ;
the difference of colour, it is true, is not much marked, but still is quite sufficient to
clearly distinguish the cortical from the medullary part of the follicle (see Plate 83,
figs. 1, 2; and Plate 84, fig. 3), or to stain the granular cells of the thymus, and
the surrounding protoplasm, of two distinet colours (see Plate 85, fig. 8). The red hematoxylin stains the connective-tissne, and the protoplasm of the con-
nective-tissue-corpuscles and of the granular cells, and the walls of the vessels ; while
the blue deeply stains mucus, almosb all nuelei, the reticulum, and the lymphoid
corpuscles.*

As a rule, if only a single staining is used, the solutions which are of a purple colour
are much the best ; the red hzzmatoxylin solutions-do not stain deeply enough, though
specimens stained by them bear high powers well. The blue solutions leave the
protoplasm of the cells almost uncoloured ; and the dark colour of the nuclei, and of
the lymphoid cells, prevents the other Å¿eatures of the specimen from being well seen,
in fact s8uch specimens are very unsatisfactory. The difference in colour of the hematoxylin 80lations depends almosb entirely on
the alum which is used in making them. Tt is true that the different woods give a
slightly different extract, but the variation between the extracts, whether they are
made from Campeachy or Jamaica, Honduras or St.
