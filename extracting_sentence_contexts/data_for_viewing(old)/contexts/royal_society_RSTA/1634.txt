connection given by the SAP property.

Taking into account that the rotation number for a fixed point must be an integer, we conclude
the Rotr(z) =j. The same argument applies for the fixed points in W3,9. a

Remark 2.10. We observe that in terms of number of fixed points, theorem 2.9 gives exactly :
the same information as the Poincaré-Birkhoff fixed-point theorem. On the other hand, our result [=
allows to localize the fixed points (which are in the first and in the third quadrant) and, moreover, 3
we do not require conditions of area-preserving type so that theorem 2.9 can be applied to planar :
systems which are not necessarily Hamiltonian. areal

A result which is dual to theorem 2.9 can be obtained by assuming (TCO-) instead of (TC0*). : 3
We stress the fact that theorem 2.9, even if, apparently does not improve the Poincaré—Birkhoff 3
theorem, with respect to the number of fixed points, nevertheless, it contains some crucial : Ss
information about the dynamics of the map F. This is explained in the following result. [3

Corollary 2.11. Let YW: Ag > (Ap) C Ay be a continuous map which can be represented as in (2.6)
and satisfies
Rot(z) > 1, ¥||z|| =ro and Rot(z) < 3 V ||Zl| = Ro.
Let ®:R? > R? bea homeomorphism satisfying (2.11) and (I;);=1,..,4 and such that (2.12)-(2.15) hold

with respect to W; := Wj, = Alri, Ri] O Qj. Then the map F? induces chaotic dynamics on two symbols in
the set W,,9 and the set W3,9.

Proof. We observe that we can associate the following diagram to the map F :
