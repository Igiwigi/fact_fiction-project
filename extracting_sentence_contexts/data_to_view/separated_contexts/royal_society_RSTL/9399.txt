Nevertheless, as the facts which the hypotbesis is intended to
explain are facts of considerable importance in themselves, and as the hypothesis in
question will be shortly employed as tending to further the theory of ganglionic action
in general, it is desirable that I should state all the experiments by which I have
hitherto endeavoured to tesb it. The experiment which I am about to describe cannot be understood without a
preliminary account of certain properties of the contractile tissues of Aurelia, which
as yeb I have not described. The properties in question all appear to arise from the
following fact—namely, that the contractile tissue admits of great variations in the
vigour of its contractions. In my last paper, while treating of the summation of
stimuli, it was fully explained that the force of responsive contraction in Aurelia varies
