The proportion of carbon
= was slightly lowerin the R. LL. G, than in the pebble powder ; and this fact is in harmony
= with the proportion by weight which the total gaseons constituents bear to the solid
ie in the products obtained with the two powders, it being somewhat the highest, in
= most instances, in the case of the pebble powder. The proportion of carbonic oxide is
2 often rather higher in the gas obtained from the pebble powder than in that furnished
= by the R. L. G. powder; and this is in accordance with the fact that the proportion of
= carbon is somewhat higher, while that of the saltpetre is a little lower, in the former
= than in the latter. Excluding the results furnished by the experiments in which the
EY powder was exploded in the largest space (in which, therefore, the gases were deve-
i= loped at the lowest pressures) it will be observed that with the slowest-burning
EZ powder (the pebble) the proportion of carbonic oxide decreases steadily, while that of
5 the anhydride increases, in proportion to the pressure developed at the time of explosion. L
