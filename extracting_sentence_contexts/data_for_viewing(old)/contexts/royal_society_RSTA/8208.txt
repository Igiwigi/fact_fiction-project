is large; (10) is, in fact, an asymptotic expansion.

The values of I,/H, derived from observation (§ 2.4) indicate* that, if » = 1, 8 must
be about 8\/p, while if » > 1, « and % must be increased nearly in the ratio yw: 1.
Computations were made for the two harmonics P,! and P,*, and values of » from 1
to 100 were considered.t It was concluded that « and y cannot be separately inferred
from the periodic magnetic variations, but only their ratio «/y. This, however, did not
completely dispose of the possibility that some particular value of » might prove
somewhat more suitable than other values, if all the harmonics discussed in (3) were
considered, with more accurate determinations of I, and E,. The conclusion can be

confirmed, however, without extensive ican as follows: by (9) and (10),
