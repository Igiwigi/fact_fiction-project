Variation in human fertility. (a) Distribution of total fertility rates or mean completed family sizes in 70 natural-fertility populations (solid line) and
70 controlled-fertility populations (dashed line). Note that natural fertility populations are highly variable. In fact, the range in fertility rates observed in natural
fertility populations exceeds the difference between the mean fertility rates observed in natural versus controlled settings. Figure redrawn from [1, p. 48]. Populations known to have high prevalences of pathological sterility are excluded. (b) A schematic of the ‘Demographic Transition Model’, which describes the
typical demographic shifts observed as populations undergo development from a pre-industrial to industrialized economic system.
