Mention may be made, however, of two
observational experiences. (1) When it is desired to observe the balance without clamping the lever between
successive observations, it is necessary that the sextant arm should be moved slightly,
so as to reduce the twist of the fibre. This is necessitated by the fact that the lever. being habitually observed as close to the position of instabili

happens during a set of ordinary observations.
