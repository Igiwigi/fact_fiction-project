For example, when learning
words, infants are more likely to represent irrelevant infor-
mation such as indexical characteristics of the speaker in
addition to, or perhaps at the expense of, linguistically relevant
features such as phonemic identity (e.g. [66â€”68]). In part, this is
due to the fact that infants are not yet familiar with the struc-
ture of the environment; much like adult novices in a
domain, they lack the knowledge to focus on the relevant fea-
tures of the input (e.g. [69]). Additionally, some part of this
encoding of irrelevant features is due to the fact that infants
are less able to control the focus of their attention than are
older children and adults (e.g. [70]). This developmental
change has been linked to the development of the pre-frontal
cortex (e.g. [71]). The ability to selectively attend to an object
or element of the environment, and maintain attention on the
target, develops dramatically across the first 5 years of life,
and clearly shapes many forms of learning, including statistical
learning (e.g. [72,73]).
