A paradigm example is the replacement of Newtonian
physics with relativity and quantum mechanics. The concept
SPACE-TIME was added and ETHER jettisoned. The fact that the
process of concept construction is social does not, in fact,
imply that the category referred to by the concept must be
socially constructed (although that separation can be dis-
puted). Neither space-time nor the molecular gene
depends for their existence on minds or our classificatory
practice. But the social processes of science explain how it
is that we now have the concepts spACEâ€”TIME and MOLECULAR
GENE.
