postulate it (part I, p. 248).

An access of moisture in the air causes desiccated Dociostaurus to fly, to keep low and orient
into wind (Bodenheimer 1944). A change in the humidity can, therefore, reverse the course
and tracks of the insects relative to the wind, not by reversing the reaction to wind, but
simply by evoking a latent wind reaction or by changing the amount and height of flight.
Keyâ€™s data do not include the details necessary for deciding whether the different humidities
of the winds, or their different strengths, or some other differences, were the essential
rectifying element for Chortoicetes. But the form of rectification considered by him and
Williams, in assuming that elements like temperature and humidity effect trend reversals
by inducing the insect to reverse its reactions, places all the responsibility for the trend-
creation on the insect, an unnecessarily complicated hypothesis as to its behaviour. This
theory overlooks the fact that insect-wind relations already provide a basis for trend-creation
and trend-reversal, so that elements like temperature and humidity can have a positive but
indirect trend-creating influence.

EssAYs IN THE INTERPRETATION OF ACTUAL MIGRATION TRENDS

Until continuous observations on behaviour and weather have been made we shall not
know how far the various suggested rectifying processes are in fact responsible for the
migration trends revealed by cartographical methods. Meanwhile, some essays in the
interpretation of actual migration trends will serve to illustrate the suggestions made.
