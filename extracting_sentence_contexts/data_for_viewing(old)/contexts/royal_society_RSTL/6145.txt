The theories of ranges and pencils, considered irrespect-
are in fact a 8ingle theory, constituting the geometry of one dimen-

Sion. It has been een how in geometry of one dimension a range of points and a pencil '1
of lines, although considered (as they must, be considered) as existin

may nevertheless stand in certain relations to each other.
Sons, the range and pencil may of course coexist in one
