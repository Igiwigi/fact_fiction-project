than that to which it belongs in the animal body, there must exist a powerful canse
Soliciting it to some particular point. In a muscle of yoluntary motion there can
be no such cause. The nervous influence is not attracted to the muscle, it is sent
to it by an act of the sensorium, carried into effect by the powers of the nervous
organs, which are subjected to its influence; those organs which, on the one hand,
prepare that influence, and those which, on the other, convey it when duly prepared*,
The muscle is altogether passive till the influence is applied to it. But the case is
wholly different with respect to many of the organs which contribute to the functions
of the ganglionic system, We know from direct observation that in many of them,
there is a cause continually operating, which solicits the neryous influence to them.

In these organs the living blood and neryous influence cooperate in the functions
of secretion and assimilation ; and it is an acknowledged fact, that when a determi-
nation of blood to secreting organs takes place, there is in the same proportion
an increase of their secreted fluids, a result which cannot arrive without a corre-
sponding supply of nervous influence. Thus we know, as indeed we had reason
to expect, that the presence of the living blood in the secreting organs solicits a pro-
portionable supply of that influence ; and thus it was, that whereas, while I operated
on the nerves of voluntary motion, my attempts were wholly fruitless, the very first
attempt with the ganglionic nerves was crowned with snccess ; nor, since the repe-
tition of the experiments in London and Paris, has the fact been questioned.

If the facts I have stated be correct, we can have little doubt that the nervous in-
fluence is of a nature similar to the inanimate agent which was substituted for it ; for
to say nothing of the cireumstance of the neryous influence being capable of existing
