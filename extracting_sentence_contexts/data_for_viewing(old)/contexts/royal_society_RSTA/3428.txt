that most of these sophisticated analyses are unnecessary for explaining why, in spite of the
‘statistically rigorous arguments’ of Ferrie & Combes [19], the AAV amplification scheme was
useful in numerous experiments [42]. The explanation is that the assumptions in their statistical
analysis are irrelevant for many realistic experimental situations.


I found the main erroneous assumption which led Ferrie and Combes to their incorrect
conclusions thanks to my direct involvement in weak measurement experiments [12,43]. The
limiting factor in these and other experiments is not the number of pre-selected quantum
systems (photons) considered by Ferrie and Combes, but the number of detected, post-selected
photons. The saturation of the detectors generally happens much before the power limitation
of the laser source kicks in. Thus, the low probability of the post-seletction, the main negative
factor in experiments with anomalously large weak values, is not relevant. In fact, I also have
been involved in a weak value measurement experiment recycling photons which were not
post-selected [44], but the results only convinced me that it is an unnecessary complication of
the experiment.

The argument made in my comment [42] was recently developed by Harris, Boyd and
Lundeen in Physical Review Letters: ‘Weak value amplification can outperform conventional :
measurement in the presence of detector saturation’ [45]. Ironically, their letter includes the [=
statement ‘saturation alone does not confer an advantage to the WVA’ which is technically valid 23
due to their assumption of a specific saturation model and unrealistic ideal noiseless situation.
The main point of their letter was what I stated in my comment: Ferrie and Combes’ calculations, mea)
as well as a few other similar results, are not relevant for real experiments. :
