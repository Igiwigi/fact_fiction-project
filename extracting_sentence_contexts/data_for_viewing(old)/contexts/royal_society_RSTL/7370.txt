justify their being separated from them.

To the elements just mentioned chlorine must be associated from the close agreement of
the corresponding chlorine, bromine, and iodine compounds ( d 84), and of the compounds
K C1O,, 24-8, and K As Â©,, 25:3 (4 88). To the atomic heats of these latter compounds
those of individual salts K N O, approximate closely ; the latter gave (4 88) 21:8-24-4,
mean 23:0, which on the whole agrees sufficiently closely with those found for the
metallic oxides, R, O, (<4 85). I count nitrogen also among the elements whose atomic
heat may be assumed at 6:4, like that of most other elements; without, however, con-
8idering the determination of the atomic heat of this element as very trustworthy. To
deduce the atomic heat of this element with certainty, compounds are wanting which
contain, besides nitrogen, elements whose atomic heat has been directly determined.
The fact that the atomic heat of the nitrates, Ry N, Og, was found ($ 88) in the mean
to be 38:1, a third of which, 12:7, is somewhat less than the average atomic heat
found for the oxides of heavy metals of the formula R O,, might be a reason for assign-
ing to nitrogen a smaller atomic heat; while, on the other hand, the atomic heats of
other nitrogen compounds, in which it is true other elements enter whose atomic heat is
only indirectly determined, do not favour this view.

In the class of elements with the atomic heat about 6:4, barium, calcium, and
srontium may be placed from the agreement in the atomic heats of their compounds
with the atomic heats of corresponding compounds of such elements as have been
found by the direct determination of their specific heat in the free solid state to belong
to that class (compare the atomic heats of the compounds KR Cl, in $ 84, R GC O, in
$ 86, RSO, in F 87, and RN, O, in $ 88); further, rubidium (compare the atomic
