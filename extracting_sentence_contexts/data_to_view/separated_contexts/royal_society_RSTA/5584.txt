In the training process, we restricted the norm of w to be unity so that
only the bifurcation type is identified. To evaluate the identified centre manifold and coordinate transformations using the trained
networks, we take the trained N2; block and set its input to [y1,y2 =0,8 =0] and analyse the
network output for a range of input y; values (figure 3). In fact, we are enforcing the dynamics
to remain on the centre manifold in the latent space, and aim to identify its geometry in the
original coordinates. Figure 3 shows the identified centre manifold compared with the reference
