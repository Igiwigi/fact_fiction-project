theory would make for various specified measurements
on the unitarily evolved quantum state. This makes it
relatively easy to illustrate its implications in toy models.
The proposal relies on the existence of particles, or wave
packets, or field perturbations, that travel at light speed.
In this sense, it is intrinsically relativistic. It is motivated
by the fact that quantum electrodynamics suggests it
is sensible—albeit not rigorously justifiable—in some
circumstances to think of photons as individual particles
that do indeed travel at essentially light speed in the
vacuum. Most approaches to unifying quantum theory
and gravity suggest similar intuitions about gravitons,
although of course the direct evidence for quantum
gravity is thin.

In a certain sense, these light-speed particles (packets,
field perturbations) play the role of an environment, in
that we infer the actual state of a physical system in a
