overproduction of new red corpuscles of, so far as can be judged, normal character.*
We obtained, however, definite evidence in one case that the change in the percentage
values was initiated by a concentration of the blood owing to a loss of plasma, and it
is probable that the same held good in two other cases. So soon as the new
formation of red cells was well under way, the volume of the blood apparently
commenced to increase. We say “apparently” because we have not taken into
account in this connection a possible increase in the amount of hemoglobin in the
muscles; if there had been such an increase the real volume of the blood would have
been less than the apparent, and might, in fact, had the increase of muscle hemoglobin
been very great, have been the same as under normal circumstances at sea-level.
We have, however, no direct information bearing on this question, and in the light of
our observations at the beginning and just after the end of our stay on the Peak, a
change of blood volume is rendered more probable. Such an increase of blood volume
might have two explanations. It might be merely a reaction to the increased
viscosity of the blood as the concentration of red corpuscles rises,+ for one method of
compensation for increased viscosity would be to increase generally the calibre of the
blood-vessels. Such a vaso-dilatation would necessitate an increase in the volume of
blood occupying those vessels. The increase of blood volume might on the other hand ~
be due merely to the operation of a function normally in existence, which is directed
to maintaining the volume of the plasma constant—a function which perhaps does
not owe its existence only to changes in a physical factor such as viscosity. That is
