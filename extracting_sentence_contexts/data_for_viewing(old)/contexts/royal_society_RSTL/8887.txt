ether, movement takes place in an opposite direction, and the arms rotate normally.
On stopping this efflux of heat by covering the instrument with a hot shade (163), I
changed the direction of movement by causing the surfaces to absorb instead of emit
heat.

An irregular emission or absorption of heat (164) stops the movement altogether,
for the reasons given in pars. 155 to 158.

175. T have made an apparatus by means of Fig. 10.
which I hoped to put the above theory to accurate
test. The results are not s0 definite as they ought
to be in order to settle the question ; but they are
worth giving in detail, as some novel facts have been
elicited by them. .

Fig. 10 shows the instrument: @ is the bulb of
a radiometer of the nsual construction, having pith
disks blacked on one 8ide. 6 is a tube sealed into
one ide of the bulb, and having two stout plati-
num wires passing along it, sealed their whole Â«
length in glass to prevent leakage of air into the 5
interior of the apparatus. At the ends c of the
wires, a spiral of fine platinum wire is fastened, =
