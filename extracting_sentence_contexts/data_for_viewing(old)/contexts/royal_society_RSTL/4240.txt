Both the melting-point and the analysis perfectly agree with the melting-point and
analysis of cerotic acid, which have been already given, and with its formula.

It is certainly a strange fact that the presence of this body in the wax should s0
long have escaped the notice of chemists. The wax however is a complex substance,
and the cerotic acid to be obtained in purity has to be separated from many other
bodies which disguise its nature and reactions.

Should any chemist be induced to verify the results which I have given, I must
beg him als rigidly to observe the methods I have laid down for the preparation and
purification of the substances, for errors which are slight in the analysis of the sub-
Stance and which neither the analysis nor melting-point detect, become of great im-
portance when the transformations of the substance are investigated, and its atomic
weight is to be determined.

The alcoholic extract, out of which the cerotic acid has crystallized, contains,
