This elimination yields the relations

for Maxwell molecules,

for hard spheres. Of course, this trivially gives us the decay of velocity u for increasing p:

Ho du _ A 0

for Maxwell molecules. The computation for hard spheres is easier to do via the chain rule

du du/dy 7 3\ (A -

Thus in both the cases of Maxwell molecules and hard spheres, we see u is decreasing for [=
increasing r consistent with the video. 8
The reader may ask what if we had used Maxwell’s formula for the shear stress which, in fact,
is quite similar to the one obtained from the Burnett truncation. This shear stress does possess a aoa)
capillarity-like term, but the constant A given by Maxwell is negative and hence the gas would fo
move in the wrong direction. This again reinforces the failure of the Burnett truncation. a]
