The usual diencephalic commissures are identified as commissura transversa,
commissura minor, commissura horizontalis, commissura habenularis, commissura
posterior. One of the most unusual findings, especially in the Diaphus and
Bathypterois brains, is the exceedingly large transverse commissure. The hypertrophy
of this finds its explanation in the fact that it is a commissural system between the
highly developed tori semicirculares, which in turn are large because of the large
tuberculum acusticum and the large system of connecting fibres, the lateral
longitudinal fasciculus. The brains of Diaphus and Bathypterois clearly show that
the transverse commissure is a commissural system for the torus semicircularis, and
not an optic commissure. In the Saurida brain, on the other hand, where the optic
tectum is fairly large and the torus small, the transverse commissure is equally small.
