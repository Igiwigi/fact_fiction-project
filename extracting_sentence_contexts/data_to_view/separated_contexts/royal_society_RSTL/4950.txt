roots are articulated, and when they separate leave a clean fracture ; the condition of
the root-scar is, such as I have just described it, in all parts; that of the leaf-scars
exhibits the open end of air-canals of large size, which traverse the petiole longitudi-
nally; these are continued into the cortical part of the stem for a short distance, and
then terminate abruptly in blind ends before reaching the central substance of the
stem, The terminal portions of some of the vascular bundles supplying the leaves
ramify very beautifully over these blind pouches forming the internal terminations of
the air-canals of the petioles. Midway between the rows of two snccessive $piral series of leaves are found rows,
also spiral, of the scars of flower-stalks (Plate XIX. fig. 1 c), distinguished from those of
the leaves by the absence of the root-scars beneath them, by their round section, their
smaller size, the different arrangement of their air-canals, and, moreover, by the fact
that they are not supported by a firm internal process, derived from the central 8ub-
stance of the stem. These are the principal points seen on the ontside of the stem ;
it may be added, that the habit of growth is just what the arrangement of its struc-
tures would lead us to suppose ; it grows by the continuous development of a terminal
bud alone, which, like that of a Palm, throws out leaf after leaf in a spiral course,
each leaf being furnished with a branch-like process of the central vascular s8ub-
stance, which remains as a projection, marked by the scar of the leaf and its bundle
of roots after these have fallen off. The scars of the flower-stalks are remarkable for
being 80 far distant from the axils of the leaves, which must be supposed to subtend
them, and it appears to me that the flower-buds do not become developed until the
leaves of the series above them, as well as of that below them, have been perfected.
