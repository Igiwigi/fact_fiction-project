On the other hand, it is shown (I, §5) that if the
stress components (¢,,,4,,,...) are specified, the hydrostatic pressure p can be determined
in terms of them by means ofa cubic equation, which may yield one or three real values for ,
depending on the magnitudes of the stress components and of the physical constant EF. It is shown, however, (I,§6) that only one of these values of /—the least—leads to real
values of the strain components (¢;,,¢,,,---)- It is thus apparent that if a cube of incom-
pressible, neo-Hookean material is subjected to a pure, homogeneous deformation and the
stress components in the deformed state are specified, the state of strain of the deformed cube
is uniquely determined. This fact can be used to prove the further theorem that if, in an
element of an incompressible, neo-Hookean material, which has the form of a cube in its
undeformed state, the total forces, acting normally over each pair of parallel faces, are
specified, then the components of strain are uniquely determined provided that one or more
of the forces acting is negative, or, if they are all positive, their geometric mean is less than
}E (§2). Ifall the forces are positive and their geometric mean is greater than }F, then the
possibility of more than one equilibrium state exists. These equilibrium states are of eight
different types.
