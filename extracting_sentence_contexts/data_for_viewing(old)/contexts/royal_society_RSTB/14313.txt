deleted, the X becomes upregulated in males. This frans-
factor did not contribute to DC evolution in nature, maybe
because it is deleterious to globally overexpress the X
chromosome for genes that still retain Y expression.

The maternal X chromosome upregulation found in
S. latifolia males and females [59] brings a new light to inter-
pret early cytological results. The hypermethylated X in
females could be the paternal X (expressed at ancestral
levels), while the hypomethylated X could be the upregulated
maternal X in males and females. Hypermethylation could be
the ancestral epigenetic state of the X chromosome, as
suggested by the fact that the paternal X is expressed at
ancestral levels. Epigenetic studies in other Silene species
without sex chromosomes could help clarifying this point.

A recent study corroborated this hypothesis using various
antibodies against active and repressive histone marks and
DNA methylation. Immunostaining of root meristematic
tissue in S. latifolia females showed that the active histone
marks H3K4me2 and H3K9ac were enriched on one of the
two Xs (named XI, electronic supplementary material,
figure S1), while DNA methylation was enriched on the
other X (named X2) [55]. Interestingly, X1 has a two- to three-
fold stronger active histone mark signal than X2 or the
