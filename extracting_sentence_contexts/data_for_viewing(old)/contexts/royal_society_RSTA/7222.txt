A further check can be based on the relative probability of initiation of P.E.T.N. and
cyclonite, as obtained from the experimental data (table 32), at low impact heights; this is
also in reasonable agreement. Calculations would take too much space to give in detail,
but it can be shown that 1220° K > 7> 590° K, on the basis of reasonable physico-chemical

assumptions about the extent of decomposition required for self-heating, sufficient to lead
to detonation.

(2) Experiments with skins of low melting metals on the anvil

The temperature of grit hot spots has an upper limit which is determined by the melting
point of the metal surface, on which the grit impinges. This fact makes it possible to control
the maximum temperature of grit hot spots by using metal foil to confine the explosive in
the Rotter impact test. The following table describes experiments on the grit sensitization
of cyclonite using 0-2 % of carborundum grit, the explosive being confined between disks
of aluminium or of tinfoil 0-001 in. thick.

An unexpected result discovered in these experiments is that metals such as aluminium,
and especially tin, greatly increase the ordinary impact sensitiveness of cyclonite in the
absence of grit. The implications of this observation for the mechanism of impact sensitive-
ness are being followed up.

For the purpose of this report, the essential point to note is that added grit fails to lead to
an increase in the percentage initiation when tin is used for confining the explosive.
