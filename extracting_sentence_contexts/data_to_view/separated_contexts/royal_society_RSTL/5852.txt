Arenicola, the generative products
in both sexes are early introduced into the general cavity, in the fluid of which they
rapidly become deyeloped. In concluding his remarks upon the Terebellide, the author is anxious to recapitulate
one or two points. That the lateral pouches are the real reproductive organs is certain

from these facts :â€”
S At a particular season they are crowded with ova (in the female) and sperm-cells (in
he male). These products respectively are less developed than those contained in the
neral cavity; but as to their being one and the same bodies in the two places, there is
EM doubt. Next, there is the negative evidence of the absence of any other organ in
Jhe body entitled to be called a genital apparatus.
