experiments on August 30, is given double weight in calculating the mean value of 8.

The determinations of the specific heat made with bottles which were full at the
commencement of the runs do not show sufficiently definite deviations from those
made with bottles which were nearly empty to warrant grouping them separately ;
it is interesting to observe, however, that the effect of the presence of air can
occasionally be detected in the observations, for example, in the case of the experi-
ments performed on August 21, the observations for Experiment 1 were taken after
the bottle had been running for 40 minutes, while those for Experiment 2 were taken
after it had been running about 20 minutes longer. If the values of CE/8@ are
calculated, it will be seen that in Experiment 2 the value of CE/80 has increased
while that of Q has decreased, indicating that as the CO, became purer, the specific
heat increased ; the fact that the value of S calculated from 1 and 4 does not come
out less than the value calculated from 2 and 3 may be due to the bottle 2 in
Experiment 4 containing CO,, which was less pure than that contained by bottle 1
in Experiment 1,

(29) Variation of the Specific Heat at Constant Pressure with Pressure.—From
the equation on p. 230 it can be shown the (és/dp), = 2(n+1)c¢/@. Prof. CaLtenDaR
has shown that* for CO,, 1 = 2, ¢ = 4°56. Hence at 20°C, (3/dp). = 0°0811, or if
S be expressed in calories per gr. degree C., and 1 em. of Hg be taken as the unit of
pressure (0s/0))) = 0°000026, corresponding to a change of 0°01 per cent. in the
