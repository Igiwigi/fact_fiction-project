]. Introduction

Chemical plumes resulting from natural or anthropogenic emissions in the atmosphere can be
unexpected and toxic. The detection and classification of such plumes in an efficient way would
reduce the risk of harmful exposures [1,2].

Recent advances in technology have provided hardware capability to easily measure the
reflection energy from a large region and to generate hyperspectral images that can be used

to spot and classify chemical plumes. A hyperspectral image is, in fact, a picture taken over a 3
large number of frequencies by means of special sensors. The data produced are a hypercube : 5
whose layers are two-dimensional images each corresponding to a different frequency. Hence : 5
each pixel of the hypercube contains a spectral signature of the corresponding physical region 1p
[3]. Given a hyperspectral image of an area where a chemical plume might be present, the plume : <
detection problem can be divided into three subproblems. Namely, observing the presence of a : 3
plume, recognizing the chemical or chemicals contained in it and classifying the pixels of the :B
hyperspectral image. 78

Solving entirely and accurately the whole plume detection problem is not an easy task. For : s
this reason, at the end of 2012, Dimitris Manolaski and his research group at the Massachusetts 1A

Institute of Technology Lincoln Laboratory, Cambridge, MA, USA, launched the Chemical-
