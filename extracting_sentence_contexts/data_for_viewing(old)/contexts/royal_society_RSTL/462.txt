part readily-crumbled, on being rubbed with a hard body ; and,
on being broken, a quantity of it attached itself to the magnet,
but more particularly the outside coat or crust, which appeared
almost wholly attractable by it.

As two of the more perfect stones which I had obtained, as
well as parts of some others, have been examined by several
gentlemen well versed in mineralogy and chemistry, I shall
not attempt any further description of their constituent parts :
nor $hall I offer any conjecture respecting the formation of such
singular productions, or even record those which I have heard
of others, but leave the world to draw their own inferences from
the facts above related. I shall only observe, that it is well
known there are no volcanos on the continent of India; and.
as far as I can learn, no stones have been met with in the
earth, in that part of the world, which bear the smallest resem-
blance to those above described.

It remains for me to speak of a substance mentioned in the
Lithophylacium Bornianum, Part I. page 125, described thus :
* Ferrum retractorium, granulis nitentibus, matrice virescenti
immixtis, ( Ferrum virens LINN.) cujus fragmenta, ab unius
ad vigenti usque librarum pondus, cortice nigro scoriaceo
« circumdata, ad Plann, prope Tabor, circuli Bechinensis Bohe-
** mize, passim reperiuntur,”
