Becqusrer, © On the
magnetic actions excited in all bodies by the influence of very energetic magnets,” read to the Academy of
Sciences on the 27th of September 1827, and published in the Annales de Chimie, xxxvi. p. 337. It relates
to the action of the magnet on a magnetic needle, on soft iron, on the deutoxide and tritoxide of iron, on the
tritoxide alone, and on a needle of wood. The author observed, and quotes CouLons as having also observed,
that a needle of wood, under certain conditions, pointed across the magnetic curves ; and he also states the
striking fact that he had found a needle of wood place itself parallel to the wires of a galvanometer. These
effects, however, he refers to a degree of magnetism less than that of the tritoxide of iron, but the same in
character, for the bodies take the same position. The polarity of steel and iron is stated to be in the direction
of the length of the substance, but that of tritoxide of iron, wood and gum-lac, most frequently in the direction
ofthe width, and always when one magnetic pole is employed. * This difference of effect, which establishes a
line of demarcation between these two species of phenomena, is due to this, that the magnetism being very
feeble in the tritoxide of iron, wood, &c., we may neglect the reaction of the body on itself, and therefore the
direct action of the bar ought to overrule it.”

As the paper does not refer the phenomena of wood and gum-lac to an elementary repulsive action, nor show
that they are common to an immense class of bodies, nor distinguish this class, which I have called diamagnetic,
from the magnetic class; and, as it makes all magnetic action of one kind, whereas I show that there are two
kinds of such action, as distinct from each other as positive and negative electric action are in their way, 80 I
do not think I need alter a word or the date of that which I have written ; but am most glad here to acknow-
