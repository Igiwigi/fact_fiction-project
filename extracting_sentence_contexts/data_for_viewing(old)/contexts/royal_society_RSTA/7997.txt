8 for less than 1/10,000 second, the very great pressure rise corresponds to an
@ exceptionally high local temperature occasioned by a sudden release of energy in a
& small portion of the gas. The reason why the region of gas which is touched off
© burns differently from the rest of the mixture and indeed provides a mode of
] combustion very akin in character to a gaseous detonation, in spite of the mixture
+, being far removed from one which can give rise to true detonation}, will be dealt
6 with further on. Tosum up this discussion to this point, ‘ knock” is due to a peculiar
® type of combustion in a small portion of the gas.
é  Intricacies of the kinetics of combustion of hydrogen and oxygen have proved
3 difficult enough partly to understand, but with complicated hydrocarbon molecules
5 satisfactory knowledge of the kinetics of the combustion process must prove still
-3 more troublesome to achieve. It is not intended to discuss in this paper the nature
2 of hydrocarbon combustion but only to consider some of those facts which bear on
S the particular mode of combustion that gives rise to “ knock.”
& Since “ knock” has been identified with a special process of ignition, it might be
&, expected that “knock” and ignition should exhibit close relationship. This in general
-< is so, but there are many points of difference.
—£ The type of ignition that occurs in knocking is similar to that which is produced
S by the adiabatic compression method except that in the former the gas is “ pre-
3 sensitized”; this fact explains why anti-knocks have very little effect on the ignition
© point determined by the latter method but a great effect on ‘‘ knock.”
i Comparisons of behaviour on ignition with “ knock” behaviour are often made,
Q using an ignition apparatus in which the fuel is dropped into a heated vessel through
which a stream of air is passed. Such a method enhances the effects of surface on
some of the reactions while the pressure conditions are quite different. Quali-
