Below we show this for the GS95 model by reproducing
the arguments in LV99. Magnetic reconnection is required for free mixing of magnetic field lines,
which is a part of the GS95 picture of turbulence. In fact, the critical balance that is the cornerstone
of the GS95 model can be derived from the equality of times for mixing of magnetic field lines
perpendicular to the local direction of magnetic field and the period of the Alfvén wave that this

Figure 11. (a) Turbulent splitting of a magnetic field line. An initial magnetic field line in black is decorated with plasma
elements, which are allowed to move with the fluid velocity. The magnetic field lines that thread these plasma elements at
the later time are drastically different, effectively ‘splitting’ the original line. (b) Reconnection event within three-dimensional-
driven turbulence.
