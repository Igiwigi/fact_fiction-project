A frame-by-frame processing speed of 175 fps
for 512 x 512 pixel frames was recorded on the workstation that incorporated a gaming GPU card. When processing in a batch mode at a batch size of 280 frames, an effective frame rate of 239 fps is


achieved generating over 34 fps of super-resolved images at 512 x 512 pixel resolution. Combined 1s |
with the fewer frames required by hexSIM, the fact that near isotropic lateral resolution can be

achieved with just 3 fixed-position illumination beams makes the whole system promising for the 3
realization of subdiffraction resolution in a light-sheet geometry on a microfluidic chip. It should oS
also be straightforward to adapt hexSIM to most existing 2D-SIM systems, as it requires no change : gS
in hardware but the display of a different set of patterns on the SLM. Moreover, we believe that 12

our hexSIM concept is compatible with the on-chip TIRF-SIM system proposed by Helle et al. [46]
and may simplify their chip design by reducing the number of waveguides needed.
