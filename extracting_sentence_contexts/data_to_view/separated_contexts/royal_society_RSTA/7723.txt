each factor being a coefficient of the form, and the two suffices of the coefficient
are its second and third weights. For gradient types we name the coefficients further, say, with a prefix, to define
which of the 5 quantics has supplied the particular coefficients. For a single
quantic, this fact is substitutionally expressed by the operator {,A ,A ... ;A}, the
suffices not being here expressed as the prefixes alone are permuted. Tor binary
forms, where there is only one suffix, the fact is equally well and more conveniently
expressed by a permutation of the suffices. In ternary forms where there are two
suffixes the permutation (,A ,A) is expressed by the compound permutation (p, p,) (4, q,)
of the suffixes.
