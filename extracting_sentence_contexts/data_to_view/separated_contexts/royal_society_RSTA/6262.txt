Looking from a more holistic perspective, it is important to realize that
materials and processes have an intrinsic life cycle. This concept has been nicely documented
in catalysis research and referred as the ‘birth, life and death’ of a catalytic solid [26,27]. Birth
refers to the fact that a freshly prepared catalyst material first needs to be activated when


loaded in the chemical reactor. During this activation phase, the material structurally changes
to a point where it enters the active period of its life cycle. Even in the active period, catalytic
solids show a heterogeneous spatio-temporal behaviour.
