Evidently, this is due to the fact
that the monoclinicity is small. The bent configuration is quite stable when the field is removed. This can be understood from
the fact that, due to the + invariance, fine arrays of 180° magnetic domains can be introduced into
each triangle, with 1/2 volume fraction + and 1/2 — so as to reduce the magnetostatic energy to
a low level when no applied field is present.

3. Austenite/martensite circle

As we now explain, the elementary construction given above is a special case of a much more
general method of constructing curved zero-energy microstructures. From formula (2.12), one
can realize that it is produced by a particular action of two discrete groups of isometries, the
group of rotations of multiples of angle 6 about a point (circle group) and the one-dimensional
translation group.
