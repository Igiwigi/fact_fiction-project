The Skeleton of the Arms.â€”That the ambulacral ossicles are paired and opposite
is well known, and it has been asserted by Stirz, whose statement is confirmed by
Dr. Grecory, that they are fused in the median line. As this is a matter of some
importance, it may be considered first. The notion of a union of the ambulacral
ossicles is not suggested by an examination of either the actinal or abactinal surfaces

of the arm; a deep groove separates the adjacent ossicles on each face, and was
doubtless occupied by a radial water vascular canal on the ventral side. The
existence of these grooves does not prove conclusively that the ossicles were separate ;
the fact, however, that in some specimens a displacement of the ossicles has occurred,
so that the members of a pair cease to be opposite, and become alternate in position
is suggestive, and proves that, if any connection originally existed, it must have been
of the slightest kind.

A few of the Leintwardine specimens are preserved, not as casts, but as solid
caleareous residues, and these provided the material from which the models were
made. In the case of transverse sections, the relations of the parts were fairly well
shown, though their form had been greatly distorted by earth pressure. No evidence
was obtained of any intimate union between the ambulacral' ossicles. A welcome
confirmation of the statement that upper and under arm-plates are absent in these
Ophiurids was met with: the lateral arm-plates were seen bearing spines, and
articulated with the ambulacral ossicles, but no trace of any other structures was
