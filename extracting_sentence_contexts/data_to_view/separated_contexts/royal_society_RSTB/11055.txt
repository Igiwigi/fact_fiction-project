Intri-
guingly, the ventral-to-dorsal striatal transition has also been
demonstrated in a behavioural addiction—internet gaming
disorder. Those with the disorder showed higher CS-induced
activations than healthy controls in both ventral and dorsal
striatum. But, activity in the left ventral striatum was, in fact,
negatively correlated with CS-elicited craving, which was
instead positively correlated with activations in the right
dorsal striatum (putamen) and left caudate nucleus [93]. These data indicate that the intrastriatal transitions we have
demonstrated in rats seeking cocaine and recently heroin
(R Hodebourg, JE Murray, M Fouyssac, M Puaud, BJ Everitt,
D Belin 2017, unpublished), and seen in humans addicted to
drugs, may not be restricted to drug-induced plasticity in this
circuitry. In human subjects engaged in learning a virtual
maze task that revealed individual differences in spatial
versus stimulus—response navigational strategies, response
learners who had greater use of abused substances than spatial
learners (double the lifetime alcohol consumption, a greater
number of cigarettes smoked and a greater lifetime use of can-
nabis) also showed increased dorsal striatal grey matter
volume and activity measured using fMRI, while spatial lear-
ners had increased hippocampal grey matter and activity
[94].
