any corresponding variation in oxygen consumption, or necessary alteration in the
character of the metabolic processes in the tissues.

Two factors at least which might be responsible for the latter effect suggest them-
selves at once, namely, (a) shortage of oxygen arising from the increased oxygen
requirements of the body, and (b) general rise of body temperature due to the
muscular exertion.

In recent years the phenomena of deficiency of oxygen which may arise during
muscular work have been ascribed, at least during severe exertion, to the action of
lactic acid liberated in the active muscles in consequence of the metabolism of these
muscles out-running the available oxygen supply that can be furnished by the blood
stream,* and Ryrret has, in fact, shown the presence of lactic acid in blood and urine
as a result of hard muscular work.t

Lactic acid arising in this way will give rise to several effects. It will lower the
alkalinity of the blood, and, since the activity of the respiratory centre is dependent
on the hydrogen ion concentration in the blood, thus aid carbonic acid to excite the
respiratory centre, a lower partial pressure of CO, being required to stimulate the
centre to a given degree than would be the case in the absence of lactic acid. As
lactic acid which has reached the blood stream is extremely slowly eliminated or
destroyed (see Ryffelâ€™s data), it will tend to accumulate, and the hyperpncea will,
consequently, become much greater than one would expect from the CO, stimulus
alone. If the excessive hyperpncea caused in this way is sufficiently great, the
alveolar CO, pressure may actually be reduced below the normal resting threshold
