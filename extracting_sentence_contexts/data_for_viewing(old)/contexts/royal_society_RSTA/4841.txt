is self-adjoint if and only if c=0, in which case it coincides with the classic momentum operator
po of quantum mechanics, acting on Ho =L?(R) and with spectrum o (po) = R; e.g. [80,107,110].


Similarly, if we let —Ac = (pc)? = —(dc)* denote the free c-Hamiltonian, then the group {e~!"**}

is unitary if and only if c=0.

We can next proceed to rigorously define the spectral operator a= ac by the expression ac :=
(dc) or, more concisely, a:= ¢(d), in the sense of the functional calculus for unbounded normal
operators (e.g. [104]). Of course, we are using here the fact that (according to theorem 4.1 above),
d¢ is an unbounded normal operator. Note that, by definition, the domain of a is given by D(a) =
{f € H.: af € H,}. In the sequel, cé(E) denotes the closure of E ¢ C in C.

Theorem 4.4 ([8]). For every cE R, the spectral operator a=a, is a (possibly unbounded) normal
operator on He, with spectrum o(a) given by (ac) =cl({é(s) : Re(s) =c, s € C}). (When c =1, the pole of
¢, we must exclude s = 1 on the right-hand side of the above expression for o (ac).)

In words, theorem 4.4 states that the spectrum of a coincides with the closure (i.e. the set of limit
points) of the range of ¢ along the vertical line {Re(s) =c}. This result follows from theorem 4.1
combined with a suitable version of the spectral theorem for unbounded normal operators (see
[8, appendix E]) according to which (since d does not have any eigenvalue and ¢ is continuous for
c#1 (resp., meromorphic for c = 1) in an open connected neighbourhood of o(@) = {Re(s) = c}),
