the first term whereof, substituting for (a, b, c, f, g., h, 1, m, n, p) their values, is in fact
equal to the discriminant «'f*+ &c. of the quintic (@, 6, c, d, e, FAX, YY. There is no
loss of generality in putting all but two of the quantities (2,4, », e, s, 7) equal to zero;
in fact this leaves in the formulee a single arbitrary quantity, which is the right number,
since the ratios B : C : D : E have to satisfy only the two conditions C=0, D=0.

I take the opportunity of remarking, with reference to my memoir * On a New
Auxiliary Equation in the Theory of Equations of the Fifth Order®,” that I recently
discovered that the auxiliary equation there considered is in fact due to JacoBi, who, in
his paper, © Observatiunculz ad theoriam zquationum pertinentes f,” under the heading
* Observatio de zquatione sexti gradus ad quam wzquationes quinti gradus reyocari pos-
sunt,” gives the theory, and observes that the equation is of the form

$+ap'+4,9%+a;=324/ Os,
and mentions that the value of @, is easily found to be (I adapt his notation to the
denumerate form (a, Þ, c, d, e, fv, 1'=0)
=40a0—166d4+6&
(this ought, however, to be divided by —2), but that the values of a,, ag © paullo am-
pliores calculos poscunt.”

The value of the coefficient in question is correctly obtained (page 270 of my memoir)
