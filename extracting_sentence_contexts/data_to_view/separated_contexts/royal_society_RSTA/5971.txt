In this scenario of low variance, extreme value distributions of buckling loads can be
approximated by a normal distribution. As a result, in preliminary work we have determined that
Monte Carlo simulations of optimized high reliability designs are generally well approximated by
a normal distribution. The second simplification, the use of a static set of imperfections, negates
the fact that different layups have different imperfection signatures due to the curing and layup
processes. However, without manufacturing simulations of each layup, it is impossible to account
for the characteristic imperfection signatures that are present in each cylinder. Furthermore, a
comparison between the Fourier coefficients of the mean imperfection used within the present
FOSM analysis [35] and previously manufactured RTS and SF cylinders [18] indicates that the
Fourier coefficients used are representative of real, manufactured structures.
