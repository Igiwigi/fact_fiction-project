These groupings make the process of colour neutralization somewhat more difficult; but
they clearly do not prevent it altogether, or a white object would be seen as though it were
mottled. It seems likely that a process of colour adaptation takes place locally. In fact,
adaptation as known at present may be nothing more than a demonstration of the presence
of this phenomenon. Evidence has been advanced in Part XI, in support of the polychromatic theory, and in
Part IX for clusters of sense organs of similar property. It is possible that as many as seven
or eight different kinds of receptors are to be found in the human fovea.
