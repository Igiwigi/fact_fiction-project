The striking and interesting fact, that the growth (and removal from the land) of a
highly nitrogenized Leguminous Crop, and fallow, have each the effect of increasing the
amount of produce, and with it the yield of Nitrogen per acre, of a sncceeding Cereal
crop, is briefly illustrated by the summary of direct experimental results given in the
following Table :—
