At 60?, 100 parts water dissolye 19:6 crystallized subphosphate of soda, and
the crystals melt at 170%. Hence, although more fusible, they are less soluble
than the crystals of subarseniate. It is a fact of extraordinary interest, that the acid of this subphosphate is not
convertible into pyrophosphoric acid by the action of heat upon the salt, like the
acid of the common phosphate of soda. Indeed, when the pyrophosphate of soda
itself is calcined with an excess of carbonate of soda, carbonic acid is expelled,
and the former salt passes entirely into subphosphate of soda, which crystallizes
in the usnal form, and contains not pyrophosphoric but phosphoric acid. This
change takes place equally well although both the carbonate and pyrophos-
phate be made anhydrous before being calcined ; and we can obtain conse-
quently an anhydrous subphosphate of soda.
