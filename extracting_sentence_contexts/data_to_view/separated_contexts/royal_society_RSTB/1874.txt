21 a number of deeply staining straight (kinoplasmic) fibres are to be seen
scattered about in the substance of both the male and female nuclei; these threads
resemble in their staining reaction those of the earlier stage (fig. 20), and areâ€”
evidently of the sume nature. In this latter stage, however, the threads are much
more numerous, and the granular substance in which they are embedded has
correspondingly decreased. We must suppose, in fact, that new threads have been
formed at the expense of the granular substance. Both male and female nuclei are seen in the stage just described to be already
preparing for the first segmentation division. In fact no resting fertilized nucleus is
ever formed.
