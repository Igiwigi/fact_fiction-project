with appropriate constants A’, B’ that depend upon A, B in (4.6) and (4.7) and functions G, n and
d. For full details, see [18]. Care must be taken to optimize these constants to obtain the tightest
bound, since the scaling assumptions are valid over only a finite range of Re. Further optimizing
with respect to the length scales h and ¢ yields optimal values ¢, =h, and

hy = CH Re“V04), (4.9)
for some constant cx, yielding our final upper bound
gf <C’ Rew (rtn)/A+n), (4.10)

If f( ~CRe-? over the range 10° < Re < 10° and if the constant C’ is not much greater than
C, then we can rigorously infer from (4.10) that (m+ 1)/(1 +1) <p. In particular, if m=n, then
n<p/(2—p), which gives n <1/7 for p=1/4. If, in fact, m=n and p=2n/(1+n), then since
f «(ur/U), it follows that Re; :=u;H/v = C Re!/(+) and thus (4.9) is equivalent to
cy

he= i! (4.11)
for some constant c’,, or hf =c’, in standard ‘wall units’ (denoted by + superscript) where all
quantities are non-dimensionalized with v and u,;. This should not be surprising, since our
mathematical optimization corresponds to balancing the contributions from the Reynolds stress
and the viscous stress in the inertial drag force (4.4) and this is the standard definition of the
‘buffer layer’, which occurs conventionally around h* ~ 12 [17].
