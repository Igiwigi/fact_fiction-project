Perhaps the most striking feature of the graph is the fact that it should be possible to
construct at all a single curve which violates none of the evidence except two indices at
Ingoldmells: one is the Roman level already referred to, and the other is the Triglochin
clay (7c) which is too high by 10 or 15 ft. Possibly local tidal conditions suffice to
explain this. The consistency of the data is a strong support for the general validity of
the curve, and it will be of very great interest to see how far future discoveries in the
Fenland are capable of fitting it.
