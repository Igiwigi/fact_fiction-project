this latter being in fact

3Li'+3MX%y+3Na%*+3Pxy*+3Qy*. The remark is not without some interest, that in fact the Bezoutiant, which is capable
(as has been shown already) of being mechanically constructed, gives the best and
readiest means of calculating the Jacobian; for in s1mming the sinister bands trans-
verse to the axis of symmetry the only. numerical operation to be performed is that
of addition of positive integers, whereas the direct method inyolves the necessity of
numerical subtractions as well as additions, inasmuch as the same terms will be
repeated with different signs. "Thus if
