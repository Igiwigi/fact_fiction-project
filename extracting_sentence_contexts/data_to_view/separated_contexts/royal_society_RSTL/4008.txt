Received May 20,â€”Read June 10, 1847. THE present memoir is not a mere description of a certain number of facts lately
discovered on the electricity of electric fishes; besides this, and more than this, it
contains the laws and theory of these phenomena. Consequently the order of expo-
sition of the facts in this memoir will be the same as that which a scientific arrange-
ment of the snbject would dictate. It is needless to remind the reader that the discharge of the electric fishes is 8ub-
ject to the will of the animal.
