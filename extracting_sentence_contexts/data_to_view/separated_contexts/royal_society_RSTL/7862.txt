He also attempts, but
with less success, to find expressions for the deflections corresponding to the bending-
moments, in order to estimate the amount of hogging. Next he shows that the longi-
tudinal fluid pressure has a considerable bending-effect on a ship afloat, following, no
doubt unconsciously, in the path of EvuLzr, but not falling into the error which Evizr
had made in supposing that this pressure tended to reduce the hogging caused by the
vertical forces. The great merit of Dr. YouxG's paper consists in the fact that,
throughout the investigations of the strains of ships, quantitative results based upon an
actual ship are given. No preceding writer, to whom I have referred, followed this
course, although BouGuer and Dox Juan took hypothetical cases to illustrate their
methods. Dr. YouxG also takes a much more complete review of the principal causes
of straining than any of his predecessors.
