differences are visible between the Cr complexes after 1s of reaction, hence just the 1s spectrum
is displayed and discussed here (figure 5, green dashed line). The frozen Cr intermediate
is determined to be a four-coordinate Cr(II)(SNS)Cl complex, based on EXAFS analysis and
advanced XANES simulations using the FEFF9 program [21,22]. Simulations show that a step-
wise methylation of the complex would lead to an upward shift of the absorption edge energy
as expected [23], whereas a downward shift as observed for the frozen reaction intermediate
can be explained by the change in geometry from a six-coordinate to a four-coordinate square
planar species, with the retention of one chlorine. The Cr(II) intermediate and corresponding
bond lengths suggest the Crâ€”-N is deprotonated in the process.

Again, as for the Mo systems, for this Cr system, at the high Al:Cr ratios measured, no
evidence for directly bonded Cr-Cr or halide-bridged dimers is obtained. The Cr(II) intermediate
as proposed here is in fact similar to an isolated species [Cr(CI-AIEtCl)){R-SN(H)S}]AIEtCls 5 as
reported in the literature [17]. However, this is the first time that the activated Cr species has been
measured in situ, at the relevant time scales, at the relevant Cr: Al ratios, and supports a Cr(II)-led
reaction mechanism. Further experiments, to provide further insights into the high trimerization
selectivity as displayed by this catalyst, including ethene, are now underway.

(d) Conclusions: oligomerization and time-resolved X-ray absorption spectroscopy

The different stopped-flow procedures, i.e. time-resolved and freeze-quench, have been shown
to provide unprecedented insights in the formation of activated catalytic intermediates at real
conditions and time scales and thereby new insights into their mechanisms. The limited activity
and fast deactivation of the Mo systems were confirmed by the structural analysis of the
