The tracing is a continuous one ; for exis
Notice the preliminary fall of blood-pressure, followed | "
and then a gradual ascent to 220 mm. Hg), the preliminary shrinkage of the kidn xy, followed by
prolonged expansion, and the very rapid flow of urine, commencing 31 minutes after the injection of
the extract. In this animal no urine was being secreted prior to the administration of the extract.

ON THE ACTION OF PITUITARY EXTRACTS UPON THE KIDNEY. 19

One of the most interesting facts in connection with the action of pituitary extract
is the prolonged period of latency which sometimes—especially in the dog and rabbit,
less often in the cat—intervenes between the intravenous injection and the effect
upon the secretion of urine. This is most marked where there has previously been
a suppression of urine, in which case several minutes may elapse before the effect on
the urine shows itself, although the effects upon blood-pressure and kidney volume
are at once manifested. Figs. 17, 18, and 19 show such a result, but with blood-
pressure and urine flow alone registered.
