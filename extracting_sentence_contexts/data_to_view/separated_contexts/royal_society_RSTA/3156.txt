In neither case could any change in the rest-point be detected. Experiments
were also made by bringing masses of iron in proximity to the balance when the
suspended coils were carrying their normal current. â€˜The effects of these masses were
much smaller than expected ; in fact, the iron had to be placed very near a current-
carrying coil to produce any observable change on the rest-point. It may, therefore,
be concluded that there can be no appreciable error in the balance due to magnetism
or diamagnetism of the phosphor-bronze support. Magnetic tests on marble were made at the Central Technical College in 1897,
using the large marble cylinder employed in the Lorenz apparatus constructed by
Messrs. Natper Bros. & Co. for the McGill University, Montreal.
