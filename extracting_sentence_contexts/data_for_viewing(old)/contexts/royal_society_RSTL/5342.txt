of the spermatozoa, the fecundatory force of the agent is of shorter duration, and
corresponds to its more early cessation of motion,

13. PENETRATION BY THE SPERMATOZOON IN EFFECTING FECUNDATION.

The penetration of the spermatozoon into the substance of the egg, or even into
its envelopes, has been s0 much disputed, and $0 repeatedly denied, that it is only on
what may perhaps be regarded as indisputable evidence, that any one ought to re-
assert it. Up to a very recent period I could not, myself, admit it as probable ;
because, throughout my investigations, I had not been able to detect any appearance
in the fecundated egg or its envelopes, either of the Frog or Newt, which rendered it
likely that the spermatozoon penetrates into or through them. Yet the fact of pene-
tration was stated by the older naturalists, not s0 much, perhaps, from any decided
proof of its occurrence, as from a confidence that it was only in this way that the
function of the spermatozoon could then be understood. LEEUWENHOEK, and those of
his day, not only believed that the spermatozoon penetrates bodily into the substance
of the egg, but also that it becomes the future embryo. In later times, M. Prtvosr

but the foundation of the nervous system of the embryo. Since then, Dr. Marmix
