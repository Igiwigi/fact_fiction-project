As8uming the common estimations of the specific gravity
of ammonia, of hydrogene, and nitrogene, the conclusions
which I have advanced in the Bakerian lecture for 1807,
would be supported by these new. experiments, but as the

* Philosophical 'Transactions 1809, page 459. M. BzaTHoLLET, Jun. in the
second yolume of the Memoirs of Arcueil, has given a paper on the decomposition of
ammonia, and he enters into an examination of my idea of the oxygene, separated in
the electrical decomposition of ammonia, which he suppozes I rate at 2o per cent. and
at the same time he confutes some experiments which he is pleased to attribute tome, of
the combustion of charcoal and iron in ammonia. His arguments and his facts upon
these points, appear to me perfectly conclusive ; but as I never formed such an
opinion, as that 20 of oxygene were separated in the experiment, and never imagined
Such results as the combustion of iron and charcoal in ammonia, and never published
any thing which could receive such an interpretation, I shall not enter into any cri-
ticism on this part of his paper. The experiments of this ingenious chemist on the
direct decomposition of ammonia, scem to have been conducted with much care, except
as to the circumstance of his not boiling the quicksilver ; which I conceive has occa-
sioned him to over-rate the increase of yolume. At all events a loss of weight is tnore
to be expected than an increase of weight, in all very refined experiments of this kind,
1t is possible that the volume may be exactly doubled, and that the nitrogene may be
to the hydrogene as one to three ; but, neither the numerous experiments of Dr,
Hsney, nor those that I have tried, establish this; it is one of the hypothetical
