The leads from the jars were hooked to loops formed by the wires attached to the
poles, the sharp ends of all wires being protected by means of small spheres of
sealing-wax. We used in the experiments a standard distance of 1 centim. between
the electrodes. The electrodes having been fixed to the plates, their distance was
adjusted and the plates secured to the glass rods by means of sealing-wax.

A few words should be said about the optical arrangements, It was for our
purpose most important to have a good image of the spark in coincidence with the
slit. As we confined our investigation principally to that part of the spectrum
which, with glass prisms and lenses, is photographically most intense, the lenses were
specially made for us by Messrs. Zetss at Jena, the chromatic and spherical aberrations
being corrected for the region F to H of the solar spectrum. When it is required to
form a spark image on the slit, sufficient attention is not always given to the fact
that lenses are generally constructed to be used with a parallel beam of light. The
aberrations introduced when objects at small distances are to be focussed, are some-
times considerable, and had to be avoided in our experiments. We asked Messrs,
Zeiss therefore to make a lens of 4 centims. aperture and 25 centims. focus, which
when placed at a distance equal to twice its focal length from the spark, should give
an image equal in size to the object within the required limits of the spectrum,
free from chromatic and spherical aberrations. The lens sent to us answered all
our requirements perfectly. Both collimator and camera lenses had apertures of
4 centims., and focal lengths of 46°3 and 39-9 centims. respectively. The prism used
was made of old flint glass by Sremuett, having a refracting angle of 59° 28’ and a
refractive index of 1°6227 for sodium light. The extent of the spectrum between
F and H on the revolving dise was about 1°5 centim.
