mic repeats) Cas (CRISPR-associated system of proteins) system [11,12], which
allows bacterial lineages to develop memory about encountered pathogens and
protect future generations.

The CRISPR-Cas mechanism consists of a machinery of enzymes that inte-
grates 20-50 base pair (bp) unique viral DNA or RNA fragments, also called
spacers, into the CRISPR loci of the bacterial genome (figure 1a). Upon
expression, these spacer RNAs serve as a guide to identify viral genomic
material and target it for degradation. Through its ability to constantly integrate
new genetic material, CRISPR-Cas provides bacteria with adaptive immunity,
which is heritable by offspring thanks to its integration into the host genome
[11,12]. Additionally to acquisition of new spacers, spacers can also be lost.
In fact, the distribution of diversity and abundance of individual spacers in
virally challenged bacterial populations is highly variable [13-17]. Acquired
spacers in type I and II systems, which are the focus of this paper, are not uni-
