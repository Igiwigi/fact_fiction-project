The second law of thermodynamics and the requirement that
the structure of the physical laws should not change under changes in observers impose
a priori theoretical restrictions on the possible constitutive choices. The decision to adopt
these constraints is philosophical and requires some concepts to be specified. We need,
in fact, to clarify what kind of expression of the second law we consider. We also find it
necessary to define the nature of the observers (and the one of observable quantities) and
the classes of their changes. In classical mechanics, an observer is a frame in the ambient physical space and a time
scale.
