a weak contraction could be felt in the 'cheek*. ?

These facts close the evidence of the fifth nerve being a double nerve; not
only the nerve of sensibility to the head and face, but a muscular nerve to the
muscles of the jaws, active in mastication, and otherwise useful in all animals

* How often a question has occurred as to this motion in the cheeks, may be seen on referring to
cases, p. 1238, Exposition, &c. and p, 57, Appendix, 1st edition.

whose jaws are prehensile and used as hands. This curious fact, originally
drawn from the anatomy and now confirmed by it, had nearly been obscured
by experiment ; since the external branches of the fifth nerve, those most ex-
posed to the experimenter, are not muscular.

I am bound to acknowledge here the correction by M. Macxnp1E, in regard
to the office of the suborbital division-of this nerve, since it has given occasion
to the revisal of the anatomy#*.

We were: inyolyed in great confusion by the discovery of new branches of
nerves and of ganglions, through which we had no guide, until we formed a
correct arrangement of the whole system. It. is satisfactory to find that the
ideas first suggested by a comparison between the roots of the nerves and their
