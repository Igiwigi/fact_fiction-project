The Structure of the Ovule and Embryo,

Our knowledge of the female gametophyte and of the embryogeny of the Araucariez
is far from complete, and through lack of material we are at present unable to add
very much to facts already known. Since the publication of SrraspurGER’s great
work* on the Conifersee and Gnetacez little has been done towards a complete
investigation of the megaspore of the Araucariez. The chief facts recorded are—
(i) the extension of the nucellus as a stigma-like beak into the micropyle,t (ii) the
sunken position of the archegonia at the base of funnel-shaped depressions in the
prothallus, and (iii) the occurrence of a fan-shaped group of covering cells at the
apex of the proembryo. The more recent investigations of GoroscHANKIN} and
Arnotpr§ have supplied further information as to the archegonia and prothallus
of Agathis and Araucaria. Our own material of Araucaria imbricata was the
most complete, and the following description is based on that species :—

The longitudinal section of the cone-scale, represented diagrammatically in fig. 26, B,
illustrates the long and narrow form of the shrunken prothallus and megaspore in
a young ovule; at a later stage the megaspore occupies a large proportion of the
nucellus, and the latter persists as a partially disorganised apical covering in which
remains of pollen-sacs are occasionally seen.
