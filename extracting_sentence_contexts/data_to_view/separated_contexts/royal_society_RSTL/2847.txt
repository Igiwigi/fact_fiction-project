DANIELL ON VOLTAIC COMBINATIONS. 155

we see at once that a current is established, which, setting out from the iron, passes
through the electrolyte to the copper, and completes its circuit through the galvano-
meter in the direction 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. In fig. 6. the connection with the iron
remaining the same, the battery cell is connected by its zinc rod with the zinc cup
of the galyanometer, and we have a powerful reversed current, which we must sup-
pose to set out from the zinc, and to pass through a portion of the electrolyte to the
copper, and from the copper through another portion of electrolyte to the iron, and
to complete its course in the direction 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. In fig. 7. the main
battery circuit is likewise completed, and the primary current will flow in the direc-
tion I., II., TTI., IV.; while the extra circuit, although apparently connected, as in
fig. 6, with the zinc, is in fact connected with the copper, as in fig. 5, by means of the
main battery connection, and will convey the extra current from the iron through the
electrolyte to the copper, and from the copper through the galvanometer back again
to the iron in the direction 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. It will be seen that the two currents coincide in their direction in that part of their
circuits which is common to both, viz. III., IV., and 3, 4.
