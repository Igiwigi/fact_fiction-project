undone) during nerve-tetanisation, has, I think, been proved by the series of experi-
ments described in Chapter III.; and towards the determination of what that
something may be, I have also brought evidence, if not proof, that one at least of its
terminal products is carbon dioxide.

+ Atthe last Physiological Congress (Berne, 1895) records were exhibited of the retinal currents of
action provoked by illumination at regular intervals, and demonstrating that the retina resembles
nerve with respect to its inexhaustibility. The interpretation given above for nerye—viz., apparent
inexhaustibility as being in reality rapid disintegration effaced by rapid reintegration—applies with
even greater probability to retinal phenomena, where, chiefly by reason of Hertna’s arguments, we have
already been familiarized with the dual aspect of metabolism. The fact that the retina exhibits no sign
of fatigue is indeed, in some degree, a collateral item of evidence in the direction of the conclusion re
nerve. “It may scarcely be doubted that the retina excited by light suffers chemical change, and it may
be demonstrated that the retina submitted to a practically interminable series of flashes exhibits no
signs of expenditure of matter, the strict conclusion is, therefore, that disintegration is effaced by
reintegration.

February 5, 1895.—Portion of a prolonged series of retinal deflections caused by stimulation of the
frog’s eyeball at intervals of one minute. Each stimulation consists in the light of a standard
candle at a dislance of two feet acting for a period af 7} seconds. The electromotive value of each
deflection is about 0:0001 volt.
