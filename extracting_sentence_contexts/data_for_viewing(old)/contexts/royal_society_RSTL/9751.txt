with the fact that the presence of the conductor renders negative discharge easier fro
the part of the tube nearest to it, and that the streams of molecules, in consequence of
their inertia, persist in maintaining a nearly diametral path although the direetic
from which comes the demand for the negative discharge which is inclined ab an ang
to this.*
We will now return to the excepted case in which the positive luminosity is made
to pass in a zigzag direction through the tube (Plate 29, fig. 27). As we have 8aid,
the places where it appears to impinge on the side of the tube are marked by patches
of phosphorescence. These patches are as a rule exceptionally brilliant. Tf an objecb
within the tube be situated 80 that the column of laminosity comes into contact vith
it on thus crossing the tube, it will be found that it casts a shadow in the direction I
which the column strikes itâ€”thab is to say, in the direction of the course of tl
column as we proceed towards the positive terminal. In fact, in guch cages
shadow is much as it would be if the column were threaded throughout its who
length by molecular streams coming from the negative terminal and procee
towards the positive terminal. +
Now before we proceed further we must call attention to the fact that it 1s only

* Tf the conductor be brought towards the other side of the tube exactly opposite to whero 4
laminosity and its attendant phosphorescence is situated it often splits the line of phosphorescence
two, one situated on each ide of the thin column of positive luminosity.
