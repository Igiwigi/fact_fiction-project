Psilotaceze is still homologous throughout, while, as above concluded, it
homologous with the sporangium of other Lycopodinee.

The presence of the two leaf-lobes, in the fertile leaves of these two ge
doubtless one of their most peculiar features, as well as most difficult to harm
with the condition of the leaf in allied plants. The Lycopodinex are so st
characterized by the simple form of their leaves, that these parts of the Psil

te in form than foliage leaves of the same plant. It must not be forgotten
