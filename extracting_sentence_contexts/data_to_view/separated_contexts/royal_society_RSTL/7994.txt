Consequently the transformed equation of J (corresponding to the choice of the double
signs) is simply
=+(7+y+27+0)=S.
(47+ +2+v')*=(aa/+by/+2+dv')*+(@# +0 +027 +w')?
+(d'a W Wy +&z +d'v} +(a"a on Wy ++ dw. This can be written in a more convenient manner by the following substitution, and by

suppressing accents as being no longer necessary,
Let us denote the result of substituting the coordinates of the pole of

and we $hall have the equation of J, in the following form:

Hence

+2(1—L)jz+2(1—M)zz+2(1—N)ay (26)
+2(1—P)aw+2(1—Q)yw+2(1—R):zw=0.
15. The equation 9, is the locus of all the double points of the quadric

A(8—A)+p(S—B)+o(S'—0)+e($—D),

In fact this is equivalent to the equation
(a+Þ«+1+2)S—(aA+pB+0+gDY,

the discriminant of which is easily found to be

(aÞp+r+g=(adl+ph+e+ed)+(ad +pb +10 +24)
+ (+1841 o+£"Y (002 + pl" +10" +40";

and A, {, », e being replaced by «, y. 2, w, we haye the equation of J,—Q.E.D. It is instructive to compare the modes of investigation employed in this article and
