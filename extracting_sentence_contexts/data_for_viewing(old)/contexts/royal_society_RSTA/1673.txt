Other designs, e.g. Ziedler et al. [6], have explored the use of inflated plastic modules for short-
term lunar use. Such a module was attached to the International Space Station. A limitation with
inflatable structures beyond low Earth orbit is that they offer no protection from cosmic rays.
A stable, sheltered habitat will be needed on the Moon for long-term use. For the lunar south
pole, Vogler [2] has proposed a habitat of inflated modules protected from radiation by a 100m
diameter dome of concrete, made using inflatable technology and covered with a 3m thick layer
of regolith.

2. Alunar habitat made from local materials

Here, we explore the potential for making a habitat from regolith or rock both to provide
protection from cosmic rays and to withstand atmospheric pressure. In fact, the largest enclosed
structures on Earth until a few hundred years ago were made using locally sourced blocks of stone
in compression. We can learn from them. Figure 1a,b shows the Treasury of Atreus in Mycenae
[7]. It is 13.5m high and 14.5m in diameter, and it has stood for about 3000 years. Its conical
structure of corbelled blocks of stone, with no mortar between, is protected by a covering of earth
averaging 4m in thickness. Figure 1c shows the Pantheon, 43 m in diameter, built in AD 120 with
a hemispherical dome of concrete blocks [8]. Light enters from above through the 9m diameter
oculus.

We envisage the same type of structure on the Moon, made from regolith cast into well-fitting
blocks, and with regolith or rock piled on top to the depth needed to keep the structure always
in compression, despite the outward pressure of the internal atmosphere. This structure will
be stable in either the pressurized or non-pressurized state. The only tension carrying material
