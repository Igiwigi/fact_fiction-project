which is not included in the table. In Experiment 36, there were present 39,
larvee per litre, and these larvee are 4°8 per cent. smaller than the normal. As
Experiment 35, where 27,600 larvae were present, there was no decrease in their si
we may conclude that it is only when more than about 30,000 per litre are devel
ing together, a deleterious effect is brought about.

A few observations were made which may be considered to come under the h
of the effects of nutrition. In these the amount of spermatozoa added to the ova
impregnation was varied. In Experiment 37 about twenty times as much spe
was added as in the normal fertilisation, and in Experiment 60 about ten times
much. In these two cases the larvae were respectively 8°0 and 12°8 per cent. a |
than the normal, but in each case the water went putrid about the second or thi
day of development, and remained so for two or three days. This fact is quit
sufficient to account for the diminished size of the larve. On the other hand, ii
Experiment 90, where four times as much sperma was added, and in Experiments 15}
and 177, where five times as much was added, and where there was no trace 0
putridity at any time during the course of the development, the larvae vary respe¢
tively by + 6:0, + 51, and — 3°5 per cent., or on an average by + 2°5 per cent,
from those developed under normal conditions, Within certain limits, therefore, th
presence of additional sperma in the water containing the developing larvee has pro
bably a slightly beneficial effect upon their growth. The addition of only a ver,
small quantity of sperma to the ova at the time of impregnation seems to have littl
or no harmful effect. In Experiments 59 and 177 only a tenth as much sperma wa
added as to the normal fertilisation. The larvae were found to vary respectively by
— ‘6 and + °5 per cent. from the normal.
