182 Count RuMFoRD's Inquiry concerning

4107,86 grains,) and it requiring now 7; parts of a grain,
added to the opposite arm of the balance, to counterbalance it. Having had occasion just at this time to write to my friend,
Sir CHARLES BLAGDEN, upon another subject, I added a post-
script to my letter, giving him. a short account of this experi-
ment, and telling him how © very contrary to my expectation”
the result of it had turned out; but I soon after found that I
had been too hasty in my communication. Sir CHARLEs, in
his answer to my letter, expressed doubts respecting the fact ;
but, before his letter had reached me, I had learned from my
own experience, how very dangerous it is, in philosophical
investigations, to draw conclusions from single experiments,

Having removed the balance, with the two bottles attached
to it, from the cold into. the warm room, (which still remained
at the temperature of 61*), the ice in the bottle A gradually
thawed; and, being at length totally reduced to water, and this
water having acquired the temperature of the surrounding air,
the two bottles, after being wiped perfectly clean and dry, were
found to weigh as at the beginning of the experiment, before
the water was frozen. This experiment being repeated, gave nearly the same result,
the water appearing, when frozen, to be heavier than in its fluid
state; but, some irregularity in the manner in which the water
lost the additional weight which it had appeared to acquire
upon being frozen, when it was afterwards thawed, as also a
sensIble difference in the quantities of weight apparently ac-
quired in the different experiments, led me to suspect, that the
experiment could not be depended on for deciding the fact in
question ; I therefore set about to repeat it, with some varia-
tions and improvements ; but, before I give an account of my

further investigations relative to this subject, it may not be amiss
to mention the method I pursued for discovering whether the
appearances mentioned in the foregoing experiments might not
arise from the imperfections of my balance; and it may likewise
be proper to give an account, in this place, of an intermediate
experiment which I made, with a view to discover, by a shorter
route, and in a manner less exceptionable than that above
mentioned, whether bodies actually lose, or acquire, any weight,
upon acquiring an additional quantity of latent heat. My suspicions respecting the accuracy of the balance arose
from a knowledge,—which I acquired from the maker of it, —
of the manner in which it was constructed.
