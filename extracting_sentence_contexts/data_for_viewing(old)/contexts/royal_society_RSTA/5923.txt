with ¢ =op, L>0 and C,C; €L'(0, 7). Uniform boundedness of the family {u”},~9 in L?(0, T; Bg’ (T")) is equivalent to the
condition that coefficients Co(t), Ci(!) independent of v > 0 exist so that the bounds (1.8) are satisfied for a.e. t € [0, T].

?However, weak Euler solutions with less regularity u < C!/>~([0,T] x T@) and which do not conserve energy have been
constructed [29] after a long series of works [30-32] and they can be made strictly (globally) dissipative [33]. See [34] for
a very nice recent review of the subject. In a sense, these solutions exhibit exact K41-type behaviour, although they are not
known to arise as physical limits of Leray solutions of Navier-Stokes as required to make contact with real-world high-Re
flows.

3In fact, there is a rigorous connection between these two irregularities: Isett proved [41] that if ¢, > p/3 for some p > 3, then
the dissipation would have to take place on a full measure set. As experiments indicate that the dissipation takes place on
measure zero set of (spatial) fractal dimension ~ 2.87 [42], this is consistent with velocity intermittency ¢) < p/3 for all p > 3.
On the other hand, velocity irregularity is not enough to sustain anomalous dissipation: Shvydkoy [43] proved that ‘ordered
singularities’ with ¢) = 1 for p > 1 such as tangential velocity discontinuities across smooth co-dimension one hypersurfaces
(regular vortex sheets) conserve energy.
