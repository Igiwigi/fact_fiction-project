A case parallel to the last-mentioned, where a fixed obstacle cleaves'a
S descending stream and leaves its trace in the fan-shaped tail, is well seen in several
& glaciers, as in that at Ferpccle, and the Glacier de Lys on the south side of Monte
i= Rosa, particularly the last, where the yeined structure follows the law just mentioned,
= And1I desire here to record that the views just presented as to the origin of the
E veined structure of ice, were confirmed, but were not suggested, by the experiments
S onviscous flaids just mentioned. The necessity of the tearing up of a solid mass, if it
S moved at all in a bed presenting insurmountable resistances on all sides, in direc-
s tions such as the veined structure presents, was foreseen by me whilst dwelling

Sg ment, The following extract from my Third Letter to Professor JamEs0N, written in
EZ 1842 from the remote village of Zermatt, contains the substance of all that I baye
E since developed and illustrated at greater length and in different ways rather to meet
E the difficulties of others, than to confirm what was plainly fixed in my own mind,

2] «The glacier struggles between a condition of fluidity and rigidity. It cannot
S obey the law of semi-fluid progression (maximum velocity at the centre, which is no
5 hypothesis in the case of glaciers, but a fact), without a solution of continuity per-
Aa pendicular to its sides. If two persons hold a sheet of paper $0 as to be tense, by
the four corners, and one move two adjacent corners, whilst the other two remain at
rest or move less fast, the tendency will be to tear the paper into sbreds parallel
to the motion; in the glacier the fissures thus formed are filled with percolated
water, which is then frozen. It accords with this view,—lst, that the glacier moves
fastest in the centre, and that the loop of the curve described coincides (by observa-
tion) with the line of swiftest motion. 2nd.
