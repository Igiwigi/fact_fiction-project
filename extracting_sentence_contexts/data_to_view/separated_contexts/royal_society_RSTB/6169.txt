If the position
of the cionid gut is primitive, the absence of budding is also a primitive feature. If the position in the adult is secondary, then it is quite possible that abdominal
budding once occurred. The position of the gut, however, is the same in the
newly functional individual as it is in the adult, and the fact that this is the position
typical of very young diazonids before the gut-loop descends into the stalk in those
forms seems to confirm its primitive nature. Thus no feature of the development or adult anatomy of Ciona can with certainty
be said to be specialized, while there is some evidence that every such feature is a
primitive character. From this standpoint the remainder of the ascidians will be discussed.
