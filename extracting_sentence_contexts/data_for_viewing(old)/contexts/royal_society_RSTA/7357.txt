We shall consider here, in an approximate manner, the case of stalling incidence
on the assumption that the stalling is not artificially delayed by such devices as slots,
etc., so that in the standard stalled condition y is only a moderate angle, say 15°. It is
therefore possible to make a very rough first approximation in which sin y is considered
small, even if it is as much as }. This is, of course, not very satisfactory, but at the present
stage of our general study of aeroplane motion, this represents, at any rate, a first attack
on a difficult subject.

If now we take sin y, a number like }, to represent first-order smallness, then 7, is of
order —1, and, using the small machine discussed by Jones, we take rs’ to be some-
what less than unity. We shall use the equations (18-17) with yas independent variable.
It is, in fact, quite convenient to use @ if we desire to do so, but it seems more reasonable
to use y in the case of a spin in which once again a feature is the increase of y always
in the same sense.

At stalling incidence, k, is a number like 0-6 for conventional machines. Further,
Xq> Yp> ¥, ave always negligible, while z, is practically zero at the stall. Also, at stalling
