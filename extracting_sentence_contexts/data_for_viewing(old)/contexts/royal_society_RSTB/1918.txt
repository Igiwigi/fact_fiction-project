anterior extremity, which is prolonged towards the hippocampal fissure.

This operation was followed by a well-marked degeneration through the optic
radiations. Reaching the retrolenticular part of the internal capsule, these
degenerated fibres passed in a series of large well-defined bundles partly into and
partly through the pulvinar, whence many were traced into the outer portion of the
anterior quadrigeminal region, A few were traced onwards from this into the
so-called “middle zone” of white matter (Plate 2, fig. 5), some of which crossed
the middle line into the corresponding body of the opposite side. In the upper
parts of this region, some of the fibres coming from the pulvinar were also observed
in the posterior commissure, by which means a connection was effected with the
opposite side. That the cortical origin of these fibres was limited to the occipital:
lobe was apparent from the fact that uo such strand of degeneration was observed
after removal of the angular gyrus.

In addition to these large degenerated bundles of fibres, the external geniculate
body and the posterior part of the optic thalamus showed an extensive amount of
diffuse scattered degeneration. That this was of the nature of an ascending rather
than a Wallerian degeneration might be inferred from the absence of large bull of
broken-up myeline, the cut surface of these structures being covered with numerous
fine black dots. :
