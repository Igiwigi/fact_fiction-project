The fact that it is AW4, in which x in Mg,Co3_,Og is only 0.01, which
shows the largest increase in site-time yield with temperature raises the interesting prospect that
the improved high-temperature performance is due to Mg incorporated into the alumina phase. Looking at the selectivity of the samples (figure 6d), there is a consistent correlation between
selectivity for all products and conversion among all samples at all temperatures, strongly
suggesting that Mg in any form is not having a detectable influence on the selectivity or on the
relative rates of possible competing reactions such as water gas shift.

4. Conclusion

The fact that magnesium is incorporated into the cobalt oxide spinel phase as well as the alumina
phase despite the high-temperature treatment before impregnation has important implications for
the use of structural promoters. We have shown that, while incorporation into the alumina phase
may have beneficial effects on the high-temperature performance, incorporation into the cobalt
phase has severely deleterious effects on the site-time yield, which may hold for other structural
promoters. We have also shown that the impregnation solution has leaching effects greater than
its pH implies, and also that the solution is potentially capable of dissolving measurable amounts
of aluminium from the support, which presumably is also incorporated into the cobalt spinel
phase, with unknown effects.
