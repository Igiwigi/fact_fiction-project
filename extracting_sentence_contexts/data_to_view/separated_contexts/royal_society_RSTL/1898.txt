Introduction. True higher departments of eyery science are doubtless its general principles
and its laws. These have a claim to our consideration beyond that of insulated
facts or mere details. Impressed with this truth, I have hitherto devoted my
attention chiefly to the laws and principles of physiology. In a former memoir*,
I gave the outline of one of the most general of the laws of this science,â€”that
of the inverse ratio of the respiration and of the irritability. - In the present
memoir, I propose to give an account of a principle of action in the animal
economy, which has not hitherto, I think, been distinguished with sufficient
precision from the other vital and animal functions.
