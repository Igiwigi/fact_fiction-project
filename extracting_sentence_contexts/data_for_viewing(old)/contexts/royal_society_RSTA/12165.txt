same across all sections of the wire, and that the energy relations are expressed
in the same manner as before in terms of the total current.
| The electrodynamic forces between linear current-systems are thus fully involved
| in the kinetic-energy function of the ethereal medium. The only point into which
we cannot at present penetrate is the precise nature of the surface-action by which
the energy is transferred (just as in ยง 45) from the electric medium to the matter of
the perfect conductor ; all the forces of the field are in fact derived from their appro-
priate energy-functions, so that it is not necessary, though it is desirable, to know
the details of the interaction between xether and matter, at the surface of a con-
ductor.
