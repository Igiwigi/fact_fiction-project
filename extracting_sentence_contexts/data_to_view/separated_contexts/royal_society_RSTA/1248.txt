In addition
to radiometric calibration, polarimetric demodulation and cross-talk minimization between the
Stokes parameters was included in the calibration process. This dataset was also studied in
Stangalini et al. [60], Murabito et al. [61], Houston et al. [62], Murabito et al. [63]

In order to ensure the reliability of the results, here we restrict our attention to the intensity and
CP fluctuations only. This choice is also motivated by the fact that since the Ca II 854.2 nm spectral
line often goes into emission, the estimation of the Doppler velocity may lead to inconsistencies
[64]. Inversion techniques may provide a solid context for the reliable estimation of the Doppler
velocity even in these conditions, but such a technique will be addressed and explored in future
work on the subject. The focal point of our investigation is the wavelet analysis of the CP and
