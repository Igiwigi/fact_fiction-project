satisfies V(Q4+4, 2_) > 0, and its derivative is given by,

dv

—— =—(2 — q)(23 + 22). 4.7
Ge = My + 22) (4.7)
Hence, it is negative everywhere inside the oscillating domain except at 2 = 0 where it vanishes.
This result means that V is a Lyapunov function for the synchronization dynamical equations
(4.2) and (4.3), and therefore the state 2 = 0 is globally asymptotically stable.


We conclude that the two oscillation points A and B must synchronize under the assumption
(4.1). In fact, using equation (4.7), we find that

dV AV, (4.8)
dr’ ,

and so we arrive at an exponentially fast decay for V:
V<Voe*, (4.9)

where Vo is a constant. Therefore, all trajectories Q(t) flow downhill toward the state 2 =0
exponentially fast, and synchronization is stable asymptotically.
