Employing in like manner three equidistant microscopes, the
angle is obtained by readings upon twelve different parts of the circle. The second original microscope was not removed, and this afforded an
opportunity of comparing the angles obtained by two opposite microscopes,
with those deduced by means of five. In the course of this work I remarked a curious fact, new to me, and for
which I was at a loss to account. In hazy weather when the staff was 80 faint
as to be only just visible, it disappeared upon bringing it to the intersection of
the cross wires, 80 that the angle could not be obseryed. A remedy for this inconvenience was suggested and put in practice by Mr.
