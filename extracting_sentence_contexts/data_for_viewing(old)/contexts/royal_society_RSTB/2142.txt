have been shown to be prolongations of the plasm of the ameloblast cells, whereas no
such relation can be established in the case of these bodies seen in the Gadidse, as
they are not seen prior to the disappearance of these cells.

Two facts are perfectly clear: the first, that the enamel of these fishes is certainly
not an excretion from the end of the ameloblasts, for they have disappeared long
before calcification takes place; the other that the calcification does take place
in the form of a conversion of or a deposition in a pre-existent stroma of definite
arrangement.

My preparations of Sargus and of Labrus, though less perfect, amply suffice to prove
that in these fishes there is a bulky enamel stroma of similar character to that here
described ; in fact, that the process is in all essentials the same as in the Gadide,

And, as has already been mentioned, all these fish have enamels which possess a
character not met with in mammalian enamels, namely, a distinct striation which
starts inwards from the free surface, and is lost before it reaches the dentine surface,
and in all it remains somewhat doubtful whether these striz are tubes or merely very
distinctly marked-out solid prisms which serve to make this peculiar and characteristic
pattern. I have never been successful in getting coloured fluids to enter the strie of
these enamels, but this does not quite disprove their being tubes, for their orifices
may have become blocked up during the use of the tooth, or they may be occupied
by the dried remains of uncalcified material (1 and 12, p. 36).
