In 1994, before
ACL2 was released outside of CLI, Kaufmann and Moore wrote ‘Design Goals for ACL2’ [5],
the abstract for which best describes the situation. ACL2 is a theorem proving system under development at Computational Logic, Inc., by the
authors of the Boyer-Moore system Nqthm, and its interactive enhancement, Pc-Nqthm,
based on our perceptions of some of the inadequacies of Nqthm when used in large-
scale verification projects. Foremost among those inadequacies is the fact that Nqthm’s
logic is an inefficient programming language. We now recognize that the efficiency of
the logic as a programming language is of great importance because the models of
microprocessors, operating systems and languages typically constructed in verification

projects must be executed to corroborate them against the realities they model. Simulation : 2
of such large-scale systems stresses the logic in ways not imagined when Nqthm was =
designed.
