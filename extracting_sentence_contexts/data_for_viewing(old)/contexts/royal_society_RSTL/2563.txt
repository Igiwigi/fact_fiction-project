tion, especially, as from the readiness with which nascent hydrogen enters into com-
bination with azote, it might be imagined, that the ammonia was somehow or other
generated in the open air, owing to a disengagement of hydrogen from the lava.

I trust, that the having traced it to the vapour directly issuing from the mass effec-
tually dispels such a suspicion, and will serve as an additional argument in support of
an opinion I have long entertained, that atmospheric air and water both find their way
to the seat of volcanic operations, and are alike deprived of their oxygen by certain
principles there existing ; whilst the residuary nitrogen and hydrogen are evolved, in
in 8ome cases separately, in others united, in the form of ammonia.

* I might likewise refer to the existence of carburetted hydrogen in a condensed state in cavities of rock-
salt at Wielitzka, and that of al ammoniac in that of the Tyrol, as facts of the same description. The latter

might lead to some speculations with regard to the origin of sea-salt, to which I may perhaps on some future
occasion recur.
