The fact that the chameleonâ€™s new colour correlates to its environment does not alter its spontaneously casual character
here; however, it might otherwise differ from what is found in quantum mechanical phenomena. Incidentally, it has recently
been demonstrated that the presence of photonic crystals are responsible for colour change in chameleons (cf. [40]).
