W. HEAPE ON THE MENSTRUATION

mucosa is somewhat thicker than it is in S. entellus, and that the protoplasmic
network of the stroma is more granular and is denser, and the glands more numerous
and more branched than are these structures in the latter animal. In M. rhesus as in S. entellus, there is an absence of any connective tissue frame-
