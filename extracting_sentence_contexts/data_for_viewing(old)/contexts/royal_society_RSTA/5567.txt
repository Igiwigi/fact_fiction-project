For a comprehensive characterization, the cardiovascular system should then be considered
nonlinear, meaning that, due to the many interaction of multiple sub-components (figures 4 and
8 represent only a fraction of these), the system as a whole demonstrates properties in different
domains that the individual sub-components acting alone cannot [29,35,71-74].

The cardiovascular system should also be considered complex. To understand the significance
of a complex cardiovascular oscillation, it is worthwhile recalling the history and definition of
complex systems. Prior to the late 1800s, complex dynamics were associated with a purely
stochastic or random behaviour without a proper mathematical foundation. However, in the
late 1900s, Poincaré’s research on the three-body problem [75] led to the description of chaotic
determinism and chaos theory. These advances led to the concept that complex systems
are in fact dynamical systems that are governed by deterministic equations. As one might
