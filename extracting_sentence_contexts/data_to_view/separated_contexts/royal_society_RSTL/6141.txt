7. The foregoing equation shows that & is a seminyariantive function of the roots. In

fact

fo, =a,—7,+ o(a,;—7T,) +&(2,—0;,)+of(@,—7;),
is seminvariantive, and fe?, fe, fo*, being in like manner seminyariantive, the product
0 =fwfe*fo*fe*) is also seminvariantive ; ac—0? and & are seminvariants, and therefore @
1s a seminvariantive function. 8.
