In discs of brass there is often, from the same- cause, a very thin plane of porous
metal running through the centre ; and where this occurs in the plate: of an air-pump,
a bouching is inserted to cut. off the communication: betweew: the external air and the
central aperture. Keeping these facts in view, it would be naturally expected that by
employing very open sand, as damp as possible, for the lower surface of the- mould, and
dry sand for the remainder, the best results would be obtained: and such was the case;
and where other means are not at hand, specula of 10 or 12 inches diameter can thus
be easily obtained, provided they are of considerable thickness.. This device, however,
was not snccessful when we endeayoured to procure thin plates to face the compound
speculum described in the ©'Transactions” for 1840 ; the solidification of the upper and
lower surface was too nearly simultaneous, and therefore there was irregular contraction :
consequently a metallic surface was employed, from which the plate was remoyed the
moment it was solid. There is yet another method of procuring excellent specula of moderate dimensions,
which was dismissed, perhaps, in too 8ummary a manner in the account of experiments
in the © Transactions * for 1840.
