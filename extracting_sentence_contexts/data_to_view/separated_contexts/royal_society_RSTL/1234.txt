186 Dr. Marcet on the specific gravity and temperature

in which the experiments were made, could not be relied upon
as to perfect accuracy.*

It is obvious that these defects in the methods employed,
though affecting the precision of the results, and rather tending
to render them less striking, could not in the least degree in-
validate the general conclusion, that in Davis's Straits, and
in Baffin's Bay, the sea, at great depths, is considerably colder
than at the surface ; while to the east of Greenland, and in
rather higher latitudes, the temperature of the ocean follows
precisely the opposite law. These various facts having an obvious-and immediate con-
nexion with the density of water under different temperatures,
my attention was naturally directed to that circumstance in
respect to sea water, which had not yet, I believe, been the
subject of direct investigation. It had been long suspected,
but was first established by DeLvue, and afterwards correctly
ascertained by Sir CHARLES BLAGDEN, that water, in cooling
towards the freezing point, ceases to contract when its tem-
perature reaches about the goth degree ; but that, on the con-

* Captain Ross, who generally used a register-thermometer, might easily have de-
tected, by a comparative observation, any material error made in ascertaining the tem-
perature of the mud which he brought up by his apparatus ; and as he appears. to
have occasionally availed himself of that mode of checking his observations, we may
presume that his results were free from any considerable error. Lieut, FraxxLIN,
on the other hand, when he could not reach the bottom, and was therefore unable
to make use of my machine, employed that used by Dr.
