The neap tide in this case would be 7 above
mean water, and therefore 24 above spring tide low water. Hence the difference of
springs and neaps would be to the height of neaps above low water springs as 10 to
24, a ratio constant for all places. But in fact, this ratio of the excess of springs to the total height of neaps above
low water springs is different at different places: and the observations now under
consideration show in some measure the law of this difference. The ratio is smaller
when the tide is smaller. 'This appears from the observations at different places, as
arranged by Mr. Ross in the annexed Table A.
