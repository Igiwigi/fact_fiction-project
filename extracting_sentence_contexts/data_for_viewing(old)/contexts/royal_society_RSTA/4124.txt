4. Discussion

(a) Representativeness of the model

The assumptions based on CFRP laminates may be too simple to represent real composites
containing voids. However, the derived model (figure 2) could also be found at a cutaway view
of CFRP, published in a separate paper [8]. Particularly, for third-generation prepreg systems the
formation of voids partly takes place within resin-rich areas [25]. Thus, the absolutely reduced
model (focusing on area III, figure 3) is also reasonable. In this case, one has to think about the
assumption seriously that fibres are adapted to void geometry as a sinusoidal curve, as shown
in other publications [4,26]. Owing to the fact that interlaminar voids hardly affect the fibre
orientation, an estimation of the compressive strength based on fibre orientation alone would
be inappropriate.

In general, the specimens were manufactured by using glass fibres and rovings, respectively.
This allows the investigation of stress-strain conditions in the matrix around a unique void by
using optical evaluation methods such as light transmission microscopy, photoelasticity and DIC.
These investigations also show that the analytical approach should be extended by implementing
nonlinear material behaviour of the matrix if the compressive strength could be predicted.

(b) Compressive failure in the presence of voids

Assuming there are two types of voids (intralaminar and interlaminar) most of them occur
