case in front of the disc. In the expression for the number of the electrons which get
back to the dise there will be a factor «/2z7. This is roughly ‘1 for this apparatus.
The other factor is less than 1, otherwise it would mean complete reflection of
electrons. The ratio of AB to AO is therefore much bigger than can be accounted

for by reflection of electrons. The earth’s magnetic field is more likely to account for
this effect. It will be noticed that the maximum velocity is apparently reduced by
the magnetic field. This is due to the fact that the paths of the electrons are so
curved that none of them strike the case normally. As long asa few electrons impinge
on the case normally the correct maximum velocity will be given. This was shown
in the following experiment. Two coils were arranged on opposite sides of the
apparatus to assist or to oppose the earth’s field. Light of wave-length \ 2537 caused
the plate to charge up to ‘70 volt. This remained the same for all magnetic fields
from 0 to 2 gauss. With greater fields the maximum velocity began to diminish
slightly. This shows that, for velocities of ‘7 volt (and above), the effect of the
earth’s magnetic field (‘5 gauss) can be ignored.

Column IV. shows that the presence of enough air to allow the majority of the
electrons to collide with air molecules modifies the velocity distribution curves and
reduces the maximum velocity from 1'93 volts to 1°86 volts. On opening communica-
