According to Broca, it lies on the intersection of the median
line of the skull and a transverse line drawn from the most closely approximated
points of the temporal ridges. Toprinarp, however, proposes to identify it with the
inter-supraciliary point, which is determined by the intersection of the median line
and the shortest superficial curve tangential to the posterior margin of the brow
ridges. In our Australian skull the ophryon and the inter-supraciliary point are,
as a matter of fact, coincident, lying 30 millims. from the nasion, as measured in a
direct line, and 96 millims. from the bregma; the glabellar index is, therefore,
31-25 (30 x 100/96 = 81Â°25).
