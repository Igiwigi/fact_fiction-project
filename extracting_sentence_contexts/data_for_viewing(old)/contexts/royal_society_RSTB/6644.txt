therefore I consider it to be an adventitious structure. The lower “‘dy,’’ (W1Lson and
Hinv’s “‘dy,”) is now formed as a small nodule closely related to the postero-lateral
cusp; it was only indicated as a darker area in the stellate reticulum in H.P. and H.Q,

The two nodules “dx,”’ and “dx,” are found as before; the latter has become strongly
keratinized and its centre has degenerated to form a core, so that its structure is very
similar to that of “dx,” of H.Q. The upper ‘‘dy,’’ has increased in size and has a few
small accessory epithelial bodies lying close to it on its medial side.

Immediately posterior to “dy,” lies the undoubted dentinal nodule which Witson
and Hix designated “‘dy,”. This nodule is so unlike any of the other epithelial bodies,
that, to say that it is in series with them, as Witson and Hix claimed, is only justifiable
from the point of view of its position. Even its position is in fact different in that it
is embedded in the external surface of the enamel organ and is recessed into it from
outside, whereas all the epithelial nodules are, from their earliest appearance, inside
the enamel organ. In structure this nodule shows all the characters of a complete
enamel organ; there is not only the ring of dentine and the pulp, but a fully developed
ameloblast layer of cells surrounded by a stellate reticulum. Such a structure is not
approached by any of the epithelial bodies at any stage of their development. Witson
and Hit stated that on the opposite side this nodule was represented by a “typical
concentric epithelial nodule’; with this I disagree, as the only structure I can find
which occupies approximately the same position on the other side of the jaw is a split
off piece from the deep aspect of the mouth epithelium and it lies wholly separated
from the enamel organ, close to the epithelium lining the mouth cavity. It is not
comparable in position or structure with a typical nodule; it is far more like the
