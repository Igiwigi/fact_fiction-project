crust is not the primary mechanism for argon degassing from the mantle. For comparison, the

present-day rate of oceanic crust production is approximately 7 x 10?2kg Gyrâ„¢! [102], which is 3
several times higher than the rate of continental crust production according to the model of : a
Rosas & Korenaga [37] (figure 5a), so mid-ocean-ridge magmatism is expected to have contributed : <
predominantly to the evolution of atmospheric argon. Also, the degassing modelling of Pujol : a
et al. [101] does not acknowledge the uncertainty of potassium budget in the Earth [95,103] nor :&
the debate over the thermal evolution of the Earth [104-107], so their modelling result suffers {2

from far greater uncertainties than claimed.
Thus, in terms of reliability, the models in this third category are not comparable with those

in other two categories. In fact, it would not be appropriate to expect that even those with 72
some quantitative constraints (e.g. [25,101]) could supersede mantle-based models, because the Dos
connection between such constraints and net crustal growth is rather remote. At the same time, : =
the secular evolution of upper crustal composition or atmospheric composition does provide : a
additional insights into the evolution of continental crust, and any successful holistic model of 73
crustal evolution must be able to satisfy such observations. Crustal growth is a complex process, aes
which involves not only the continental crust but also other major components of the Earth 22
systems such as the mantle, the oceanic crust, the oceans and the atmosphere. To build a scientific [4
framework that can assimilate diverse observations in a coherent manner, it will be essential to : >
clarify what data constrains which aspect of crustal growth and to quantify how well it does so. : =
