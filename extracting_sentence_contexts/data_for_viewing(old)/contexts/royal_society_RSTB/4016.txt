Many low plants, such as the bacteria and yeasts, have been made the subjects
of extensive investigations of this kind. Their rapidity of growth and multiplication
and the ease with which experiments on them can be controlled make them favour-
able material for work of this nature. It has been shown by PrinesuEt (74) that
many of the adaptations shown by micro-organisms to abnormal temperature
conditions become fixed, and are apparently transmissible through many generations

both sexually and by means of spores.


ON THE EXPERIMENTAL HYBRIDIZATION OF ECHINOIDS. 329

The facts recorded in the foregoing paragraphs justify us therefore in suggesting
that the temperature conditions of the sea-water, acting on the germ cells of our
Echinoids during their period of growth, may have played a part in changing the
type of inheritance in 1912. It is obviously useless, until we have more data at our
disposal, to discuss this question at greater length.

15. CHARACTERS OF THE Hysrip SeA-uRCHINS AT THE Enp or THE First YEAR
OF THEIR EXISTENCE.

Th this section we are greatly indebted to Dr. Mortensen for the descriptions he has
furnished us of our larger hybrid sea-urchins. He has described, from the living
specimen, individuals from all our crosses that have survived the first year of their
existence. To render this account more intelligible, descriptions of the pure parent
