482 DR. W. T. BLANFORD ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF

Owing to the want of batrachia in the dry Punjab area, this is misleading. If
they are omitted, the mean percentage of Punjab mammals and reptiles wanting in
the Indian Peninsula becomes 35, and the mean percentage of the same classes in the
Cisgangetic subregion wanting in the Punjab area is 58.

The mammalian genera of the Tibetan area within Indian limits are 25 in number,
bats excluded ; of these, 11 or 44 per cent. are not found in the Indo-Malay region
Reptiles and batrachians are too few in Tibet to be of any importance.

In this summary merely numerical results are given. It is not suggested that
genera, even in the same class, are of equivalent value; for instance, the fact that
Eurylemi are found in the Transgangetic area and not in the Cisgangetic area, and
that bustards and sand grouse inhabit the latter subregion and not the former,
although only a few genera are affected, is much more important than the presence or
absence of a far larger number of genera amongst ordinary passerine birds. But the
generic relationships of diflerent areas, at all events amongst mammals, reptiles, and
batrachians, provided all are fairly represented, do afford a good idea of the affinity
existing between the faunas, although, like all other statistics, such numerical results
are likely to mislead at times.
