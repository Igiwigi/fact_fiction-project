In one test, equation (4.1) was integrated setting I and k; equal to values corresponding 28
to our apparatus, £7 equal to As (the values generated by our source mass) and the remaining oS
torque components set to zero. The difference Aw? between w* found with + and —f2s should 18
agree extremely well with that calculated using only our first-order solution to equation (4.1), Reg
because second-order corrections to w, proportional to (8/k)*, cancel in forming Aw. In fact, Aw* a
with our simulation differed from the first-order prediction only by a fractional amount 3 x 10710. cal
That difference divided by w? was of the order of 10~!°. Having established the reliability of 2
our integration simulation technique with this and other tests, we then applied the technique to 8
determine the corrections required for the many extra small torque terms in the full equation of txt
motion. Results of this work are presented in §5d(ii). =

(c) Multipole expansion of the gravitational torque acting on the pendulum :2

We discuss here the vertical component of the torque on a pendulum of density Ppendulum(, 4, ¢) a]
in a potential field (r,0,) generated by external masses with density psource(",0,¢), Where the
polar coordinates r, 6 and @ are centred on the pendulum’s centre of mass with the polar axis : =
vertical.
