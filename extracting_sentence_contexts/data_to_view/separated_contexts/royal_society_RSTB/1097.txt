In the single case in which the 6th left
a % lumbar anterior root was divided and its central end connected with the galvanometer
Selectrodes, the difference (Cat) was found to be only ‘0045 Daniell, whereas the 6th
S lumbar posterior root of the same side, when examined, showed a ditference of
= 012 Daniell.

5 D. Sprnau Corp. The fact that the cord exhibits, like the nerve, both a persistent difference between

8 its longitudinal surface and its cross section and a true excitatory effect, was dis-
E covered by pu Bois-Reymonp, and has been since confirmed by other observers, notably
8 Serscuenow. The general features of the same were described by us in our preliminary
communication made to the Royal Society, but a systematic analysis of a number of
observations has never, that we are aware, been made, nor has the amount of the
persistent difference been determined. In the course of our investigations we have
noted the amount and characteristics of the resting difference in the spinal cords of
sixty-three Cats and fourteen Monkeys, and the results arranged in groups are given
in Appendix B.
