value)), the expected value of contact motivates approach and
contact; when low (e.g. pathogen cues are present), it
motivates avoidance and our subjective sense of disgust.

Genetic relatedness, as mentioned above, is one factor that
modulates the contact avoidance response. Given interactions
involving a high degree of relatedness, cues to pathogen pres-
ence, such as a running nose, diarrhea and vomit, do not
decrease the expected value of contact as they would in the
absence of relatedness. Kinship suspends or at least dampens
contact disgustâ€”and only contact disgust.

The fact that kinship has a very different effect in the sexual
domain, where it intensifies disgust, suggests there is a separate
system governing sexual contact. That is, disgust, as a response
designed to guard against the communication of pathogens via
contact, does not automatically buy you sexual avoidance. It
would seem that the same variable, an estimate of genetic relat-
edness, is taken as input by another system, one governing
mate choice, the third system to which disgust is linked.

4. With whom to mate: expected sexual value

The last internal regulatory variable linked to disgust is
expected sexual value, an index that guides decisions regarding
