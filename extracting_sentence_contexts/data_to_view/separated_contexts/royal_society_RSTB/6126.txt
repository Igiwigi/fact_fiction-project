Nitzschia did not seem to be a suitable food organism, and many larvae were reared
equally well without adding this diatom to the water. Occasionally the addition
of Nitzschia was actually harmful, as too large a quantity would cause the larvae to
become enmeshed in tangled masses of the diatom. Taking these facts into con-
sideration, it would seem that the factor limiting the rearing of these larvae is that of
food. The use of sea-water which had not been filtered was tried in an attempt
to provide the natural food, but the appearance of small crustacea and other harmful
intruders invariably followed. Another method adopted was that of placing the
larvae in a breffet jar covered with bolting silk (fine silk net) and placing the jar in
