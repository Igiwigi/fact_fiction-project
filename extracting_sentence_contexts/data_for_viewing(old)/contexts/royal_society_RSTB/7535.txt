’ One of the striking facts of phyllotaxis is that in most spiral systems the mean divergence
along the genetic spiral approximates closely to the Fibonacci angle; in other words, the
series of leaves obtained by selecting, for instance, every thirteenth along the genetic spiral
(where thirteen is a particular number taken from the higher terms of the Fibonacci series)

will approach, though not in general precisely realize, the condition described as ortho-
stichous, i.e. the fourteenth leaf will be nearly superposed longitudinally over the first.
Plantefol stresses not only that the genetic spiral is an abstraction, a conclusion with which
few would now disagree, but, much more debatably, accords it no part in practical dis-
cussions of phyllotaxis. Even if his theory be accepted, however, the simple facts of diver-
gence, with the accompanying approximate leaf superpositions, cannot be disregarded
altogether. In terms of this theory consideration of ‘divergence’ along the foliar helices
should therefore replace that of divergence along the genetic spiral. Thus, where three
foliar helices are recognized, in the large majority of spiral systems (cf. Plantefol 1948,
figure 5) the selection of every seventh leaf along each helix will give a line which is nearly
orthostichous, i.e. the mean ‘divergence’ along any one helix is about 52 to 53°; but where
there are only two helices (cf. Plantefol 1948, figure 25) it is no longer every seventh, but
every fourth or every seventeenth leaf which usually falls on a line nearly parallel with the
axis, and there is a mean ‘divergence’ along each helix of roughly 85°. And so on with
other numbers of foliar helices; the introduction of each new curve into an apical system
radically alters the ‘divergence’ along those already in existence, although the divergence
proper along the genetic spiral remains substantially unchanged. The concept of diver-
