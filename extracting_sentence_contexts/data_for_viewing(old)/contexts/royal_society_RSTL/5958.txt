one, the ingoing limb, is connected a dense tuft of looped vessels (F+ 9. e)- The interior

124 DR. T. WILLIAMS'S RESEARCHES ON THE STRUCTURE AND HOMOLOGY

In every species of Sabella and Serpula Mg by the author, the sexes have been
seated on separate individuals. In the majority of apocies the abs (4) have a bright pink
colour. The female, by this mark, may be readily distinguished from the male, the
colour of which is brownish or greenish*. From these statements it follows that the
segmental organ in Sabella and Serpula are permanent VISOO, and not temporary forma-
tions, as affirmed by DE QUATREFAGES. In fact, it is a mistake to suppose that the Pro-
cess of ova- and sperm-development, in any Annelid, is limited to a month or two in the
year. Ova in an immature state are found in the bodies of the youngest as of the
oldest. This fact proves that the structures by which the ova are generated must be
permanently present.

The preceding account of the segmental organs of the Sabellidee and Serpulidz has
been drawn from an examination of the following species:—S. alveolata, S. vesiculosa,
Leucodore cliatus (very favourable for this purpose), Amphitrite auricoma, Sabella @
sang vert, Sabella hospita (mihi). Of the Serpulide the author has only studied with
care the following species :—5S. triguetra, S. contortuplicata, S. lactea. Tn all the Sabel-
lide and Serpulidze the segmental organ is present in every ring of the body, except the
thorax and the caudal appendage.
