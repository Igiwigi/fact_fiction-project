Taking the specific heat of mercury to be 0°033, and that of glass 0°19, we calculate
that the water-equivalent up to the point marked 12° was 2:05. An experiment made
to determine directly. the equivalent of the thermometer, showed that we could trust
the figures given by the maker, the value found being identical with that calculated
from his data. We may add 2°05 permanently to the water-equivalents, and in the
separate experiments correct for the additional length of the stem immersed, which
was slightly different on different occasions. The correction is determined by the fact
that the water-equivalent corresponding to a length of 1° of the stem is 0°34. We
may take, therefore, as the equivalents which were the same in all experiments :—
