In the imago there is a slight indication of this asymmetry (figs. 7
and 16). The fasciolar spines, however, project at right angles to the test, and possess
a symmetrical, but poorly developed, base (fig. 26, f). ‘They remain short, and each of
the six prongs is elaborated at the tip, so that the distal end of the spine becomes
“tufted ” (fig 26, f). Examination of a number of fasciolar spines from the same test
reveals the fact that the “ tufted ” extremity is subject to considerable variation. Many of these spines also bear rather long thorny processes along one side, while in
others the thorns are about equally developed on both sides. When the latter is the case,
the thorns are never so prominent as those shown in fig. 26, f.
