identities had generally been checked by computer methods and were resistant to any intuitive
interpretation. Momentum twistors revealed just such an intuitive interpretation.

The amplitudes can be regarded as volumes of polytopes. The different expressions for them arise
through different ways of triangulating the polytopes into simplicial cells. Spurious poles arise
from triangulations which introduce extra vertices. Using this insight, it became possible for the
first time to see this highly non-trivial NMHV amplitude as a single geometric object. (However,
it should be borne in mind that this polytope corresponds to one colour-stripped component of
the amplitude. The momentum twistors encode momentum conservation very neatly, but the
price paid for this elegance is that, in the total amplitude, each of the partial amplitudes requires
different momentum-twistor coordinates for its expression.)

The polytopes associated with NMHV amplitudes are in fact four-dimensional, living in a
CP*. An extra dimension is added to twistor space to take care of the range of possible helicity
allocations. This CP* geometry was sketched by Hodges [21] and further developed by Mason &
Skinner [22] and Arkani-Hamed et al. [23]. This work also showed that the new momentum-
twistor picture is entirely consistent with the Grassmannian picture as developed in the original
twistor space.

Naturally, the emergence of these concepts did not take place in isolation from other major
developments. The influence of super-string theory, without which the application of twistor
geometry to amplitudes would not have made progress, has already been noted. Another parallel
development is the reformulation of twistor Lagrangians, or action principles. Penrose [5] had
in fact derived the early twistor diagrams from a consideration of twistor Hamiltonians. The
Witten twistor-string model stimulated a revival of this approach, notably by Lionel Mason
