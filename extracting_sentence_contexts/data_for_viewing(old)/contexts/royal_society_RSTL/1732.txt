ship, he has complied with my request, and enabled me to
bring forward the following observations on this subject.

It is a curious circumstance that two animals, so different
in size, should have feet so similar in their use. In the
fly, the parts require being magnified one hundred times
to render this structure distinctly visible ; and in the walrus,
the parts are s0 large as to require being reduced four
diameters to bring them within the size of a quarto page.


5ome curious facts respecting the walrus and seal, &c. 235

As a knowledge of the structure of the fly's foot, led to
the detection of the use of the hind flipper of the walrus ; so,
on the other hand, an examination of the toes of the walrus
Has enabled me to make out the use of a part of the foot of
the fly which I did not sufficiently understand â€” I mean the
two points ; Mr. Apams called them pickers, from supposing
that they entered certain small holes in the surface, on which
progressive motion was carried on. This opinion I did not
deem worthy of consideration, but was unable to make out
their real use ; on comparing them, however, with the outer
toes of the walrus, they are evidently intended to surround
