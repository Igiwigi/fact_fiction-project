Boiling-point. Boiling-point.
198? 1590. If we consider the great difficulty of obtaining the radicals absolutely pure, we cannot
be surprised at the fact that these numbers do not exactly accord. It is not unworthy of note, that the great difference in the boiling-points of propyle and
butyle from Boghead naphtha, which might have been urged as evidence against the view
I have taken of their constitution, is, in fact, strong proof of the correctness of it, for
the amount of that difference is 53* or 26? for C? H?, which happens to be the number
occurring most frequently with the simple and compound radicals, and, moreover, it
causes the Boghead propyle to have almost exactly the boiling-point of its isomer,
ethylbutyle.
