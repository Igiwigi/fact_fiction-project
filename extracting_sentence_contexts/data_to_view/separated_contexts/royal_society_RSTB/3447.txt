Owing to the practical impossibility of separating the blastoderm from the shell
without injuring the former, our operations in the way of examination and
photography of the object as a whole were confined to the intravesicular surface
of the blastoderm. This technical disability greatly restricted the possibilities of
our recognition of the precise surface-diflerentiation of the embryonic region. A
tolerably adequate conception of its organisation was only, in fact, obtained after
correlation of the superficially recognisable features with those.of the serial transverse
sections made from the specimen later on. The accompanying text-fig. 8 was drawn after a schematic plane-reconstruction
from these serial sections, and this has served as a guide in the interpretation of some
of the surface-features which appear in our photographs. It may therefore prove
advantageous to begin our account of the anatomy of Specimen P with an explanation
of this figure.
