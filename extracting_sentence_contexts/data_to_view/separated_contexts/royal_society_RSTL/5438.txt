SJoints at oo are, I think, triple points, and the other two points of intersection with the

S reduction 54 accounted for in the class of the curye, but the curve is, in fact, as will be
Shown i in the sequel, of the class 6 ; there is consequently-a reduction 72 to be accounted

We may consequently in tracing the caustic confine our attention to the case in which
the index of refraction is greater than unity.
