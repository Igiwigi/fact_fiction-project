3. Effective potential in curved space 3

The calculation for the quantum corrected effective potential at the ultraviolet limit is surprisingly
simple when compared with what one usually encounters when deriving an effective potential
on a curved background. The reason for this is that at the ultraviolet limit all well-behaved field
theories must have universal behaviour, which translates as the fact that the divergences that are
generated are independent of the state in which they are calculated. Hence, at very high momenta
even with a background with large curvature the effective potential resembles very much the
well-known flat space results. Another way of understanding the simplification arising at short
wavelength modes is realizing that any smooth surface when magnified enough will approach
flat space.
