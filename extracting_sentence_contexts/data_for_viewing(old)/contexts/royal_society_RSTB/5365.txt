abundance of Cidaris florigemma, Littorina muricata and Lima zonata with Chlamys
qualicosta would be a strong argument in favour of these limestones being of the age of
the Osmington Oolite rag.

Obviously this quarry is most valuable in throwing light on the age and origin of
the Wheatley Limestones, the conclusions arrived at from a study of the Oxford district
being entirely vindicated. It is rather remarkable, therefore, that Messrs, BLAKE
and Hupixston not only failed to appreciate this point, but obtained an absolutely
erroneous impression of the age of the rocks, correlating them with the Berkshire Oolites
of Highworth [6, p. 295]. Their only grounds for this correlation appear to have been
the presence of Pseudomonotis ovalis, which at that time had not been found so high
as the Pusey Flags. It is impossible, however, to disregard (i) the lithological resemblance
to the Wheatley Limestones, (ii) the fact that in the Berkshire Oolites the shells are
whole and perfect, while in these rocks they are ground up, and (iii) the strong negative
evidence of the absence of all the Berkshire Oolite Perisphinctids, Cardiocerates,
Aspidocerates and characteristic Lamellibranchs.

A somewhat similar section at Dogridge, west of Purton, shows 5 ft. of Coral Rag
overlying 14 ft. of Wheatley Limestones. he latter are here on the whole softer, being
fit only for lime-burning, and are much less fossiliferous, though of the same minute
composition. Exogyra nana is abundant at some horizons, but the only other fossils
appear to be Cidaris florigemma, Nucleolites scutatus and Chlamys nattheimensis.

Exposures of both these types of rock are duplicated in neighbouring road-cuttings.
Six feet of the limestones were exposed in 1924 beside the main road in the middle of
