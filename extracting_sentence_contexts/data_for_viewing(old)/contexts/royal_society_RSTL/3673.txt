certain proportions between B and D, while C will do the same in the inverse ratio,
the said proportions being determined not solely by the differences of energy in the
affinities, but also by the differences of the quantities of the bodies. Again, sup-
posing the latter view to be correct, another question will ariseâ€”Does the amount of
AD or CB produced increase in a gradual manner with the relative increase of AB,
or do sudden transitions take place under these circumstances, such as BuxszgN and
Desus observed in their experiments ?

It was to the elucidation of these questions that I applied myself. In the majority
of instances it is impoxssible to ascertain what has taken place when a mixture of the
kind alluded to has been made; but the physical properties of salts will s0metimes
give an indication. Colour seemed to offer the best means of solving the problem ;
yet even here a difficulty arose from the fact that many bases, such as nickel, give the
same coloured solution when combined with different acids, and vice vers4. Sesqui-
oxide of iron, however, appeared to promise good results, since many of its salts are
intensely coloured, while others are almost colourless. The formation of the sulpho-
cyanide was first 8ubmitted to a full investigation ; after which other ferric salts were
more cursorily examined ; and after them a number of other binary compounds in
order to extend the range of observation.
