tions of the brain furrows. The significance of the furrows has been abundantly
discussed, and BropMANN holds that they are very secondary productions. But a
number of anatomists from Baruiarcer to Arriins Kaprrrs have fully demonstrated
the importance of their study, Fissure and sulci indicate the regions where the cortex
has been first developed, both phylogenetically and ontogenetically, and where the
projection fibres are first organised, and thereby the fissures and sulci retain their
depth. The progressive concealment of gyri within the sulci and fissures thus formed
constitutes a most interesting problem.

The study of hereditary resemblances in the brain should not be limited to the
sulci only, but with every work a beginning is needed, and the future may augment
the material, as well as the opportunity of further detailed anatomical investigation.
Thus a parallel examination of the architectonic fields might be undertaken ; in fact
Epcar Scuuster has already examined the extension of the striation of the occipital
pole. The measurements of the gyri are also indispensable for the determination of the
furrows. As a rule the supplementary sulci or differences in their direction appear as
a result of a greater development of the neighbouring convolutions.

The brain A was smaller than the brain B. The larger size of B exists in every
lobe of the brain. It is clearly apparent in the frontal, the parietal and the occipital
lobes, less in the central convolutions. ‘This gives the different lobes of B a fuller»
