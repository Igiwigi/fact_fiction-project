In three cases of extensive or complete destruction of the Rolandic
area, we have observed, in addition to the motor palsy of the limbs, temporary
hemianopsia and hemianmsthesia on the side opposite the lesion, without direct
implication of the optic radiations or gyrus fornicatus as determined post-mortem, . The temporary presence of these symptoms, which Hrrzia (39) has also observed,
may therefore be explained by a dynamic influence exerted by the magnitude of the
lesion on the sensory centres or tracts which were not organically injured. This explanation receives support from the fact that in smaller cerebral lesious—

for example, after removal of the so-called “leg area” alone—no such symptoms
occurred,
