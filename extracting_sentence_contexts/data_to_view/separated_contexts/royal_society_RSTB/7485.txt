A right M%, without roots, with an anterior loop,
three closed triangles and a long crescentic posterior loop, presenting three outer and
four inner salient angles, may also be referred to this genus. i

Microtus arvalis/agrestis groups. Series II, no. 1, contains two (one right, one left) first
lower molars, M,, both unfortunately too damaged to be figured; close study shows that
these teeth have the pattern characteristic of voles allied to M. arvalis and M. agrestis. The less damaged left tooth is mutilated at both ends; but enough remains to show six
closed triangles in front of the posterior loop and also the outer wall of the anterior loop;
the pattern of the tooth closely resembles that of the M, in M. orcadensis, a fact which
suggests that the tooth is really referable to M. corneri Hinton, described from the fissure
deposits of Ightham, Kent, which is the Late Pleistocene mainland forerunner of M. orca-
densis and related island forms. Microtus anglicus Hinton. This species is represented by two examples of the character-
istic M,.
