The most important and interesting feature of Table XVI is that R,, (75°) and
R,in steadily decrease as y increases. The regularity in this respect is in striking
contrast with the irregularity in the values of z,;,, and of R, (90°). But R,,,
does not depend only on }, because different distributions having the same value
of » give different values of R,,,3 i.e., for_y = 0-5, the Table gives two values of
Ryviny 0-71 and 0-66; likewise, for _» = 3-5, the values 0-13 and 0-09 for Ryn.
The differences in R,,;, exist in spite of the fact that for these particular pairs of
distributions R, (90°) has the same value. In both pairs, however, the smaller
value of R,,;, corresponds to the larger value of
