of air from 0* to 100” under constant pressure equal to 0-36706 of its volume at 0*....The
difference between the mercurial and air-thermometers amounts to about 0:2. Hence
the expansion of air between 0? and 50*2 is 0:18353 of its volume at 0*; or between 0®
and 50? the ratio of the density of air at 0? to its density at # is 14+0-003656 x 2.”

In the present state of science it seems quite wrong that such a want of accordance
should exist in our normal instruments, considering that otherwise the errors that exist
between the instruments do not amount to 0*:1 when properly made. I have had several
normal thermometers made for my experiments by Messrs. NEGRETTI and ZAMBRA, and
in every case, when compared with my Kew Standard, the agreement between them
has been almost perfect.

It would be decidedly a step in the right direction if in future the fact that mercury
does not expand regularly between 0* and 100* were taken into account in the con-
struction of all normal thermometers; and if s0me comparisons between the Kew
Standard and the air-thermometer were made, then the readings of thermometers which
have been compared with the Kew Standard might be easily corrected.

JoLLy®, in his research into the expansion of water, corrected his thermometers by
comparing them with an air-thermometer ; unfortunately, however, he does not give a
table containing these comparisons; 80 that his results are obviously not comparable with
those obtained with the mercury-thermometer, and therefore at present I am unable to
compare his results with those obtained on the same snbject by myself. In conclusion,
my thanks are due to Dr. M. BrenrexD for carrying out the determinations for the
Series 1, 2, 13, 20, 21, 24 to 27 and 34, to Mr. BasseTT, who aided me in carrying out
