Finally, we note that the dissipation of the bubbles may be arrested by covalently cross-linking
the interfacial BslA layer using glutaraldehyde. As can be seen in figure 4a,b, the bubbles remain
in their typical elongated morphology. Owing to the cross-linking process, however, aggregation
of the bubbles frequently occurs (figure 4b). The fact that these bubbles no longer disappear lends
further credence to the notion that structural defects in the interfacial film could be the underlying
cause of this effect. Substantially cross-linking the surface layer can effectively ‘patch over’ any
structural defects locking the structure in place.

An overall question remains: why are elongated air bubbles coated in BslA unstable while oil
in water emulsions are stable? The answer probably lies in both the kinetic and thermodynamic
properties of BslA interfacial adsorption. We have previously shown [30] that BslA has to
overcome an energy barrier in order to adsorb to an interface. Combined with the fact that an
air—water interface is less hydrophobic than an oil—-water one, there may not be a sufficient kinetic
window for BslA to adsorb and form a robust and well-organized interfacial layer on the surface
of an air bubble.

To reinforce this point, we monitored the relaxation of a BslA film formed on a pendant drop
after compression at an oil—water interface as a function of equilibration time. We observe that
there is a clear dependence between the equilibration time and the robustness of the film (figure 5).
Taken together, we propose that the dissipation of air bubbles arises from non-optimal packing of
BslA units at the poles owing to higher curvature in these regions, in conjunction with the slow
kinetics of formation of the cohesive, elastic surface layer.
