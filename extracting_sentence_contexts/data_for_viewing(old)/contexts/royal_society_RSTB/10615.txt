[60]. Importantly, however, even though navigation can be
thought of as a high-level behavioural goal, it can be argued
that the brain might still make use of low-level information
for this task. For example, localized information in scenes is cru-
cial to identify paths in the scene and to navigate around
obstacles (figure 1, top right). Surface reflection and texture
may be useful for identifying the accessibility of regions to be
navigated, e.g. whether they are rough or slippery, while the
spatial layout and three-dimensional surfaces may be important
for identifying spatial boundaries that restrict movement.

These arguments suggest that low- or mid-level level fea-
tures may in fact play a pervasive and potentially useful role
in scene perception. In ยง5 we shall review neural evidence
supporting this view in both the spatial and temporal
domains as obtained with fMRI and magneto- and electro-
encephalography (MEG/EEG), respectively. We will show
that despite earlier claims of position invariance, scene-
selective areas contain plentiful information about position,
evidenced by retinotopic biases towards specific parts of
the visual field. Then we review recent EEG and MEG evi-
dence of sensitivity to low- and mid-level information
representation across multiple stages of processing in scene
perception.
