two of larger size than the rest, and which I have imagined to be the remains of the
germinal spot, and possibly the origin of the future embryo vesicle of the impregnated
ovyum, an opinion, however, which I have not had the means of verifying, and I must
further state that I have failed to recognize these larger cells in ova that were free in
the cavity of the abdomen. Each of the three species of Newt, as well as the Frog,
have presented similar appearances in the germinal vesicle and oyum under similar
circumstances.

Thus it is quite certain that the germinal vesicle disappears in the Amphibia before
the oyum enters the oviduct. I believe it does $0 in the interior of the yelk, not in
the centre, but nearer to the dorsal than to the future ventral or white surface ; and
not, as has been 8upposed, on the dorsal or dark sarface, between the vitellus and the
vitelline membrane. "This view is supported by the fact, that that portion of the yelk
which incloses the vesicle in an advanced stage of the oyum in the Frog is of a more
or less intense black colour, while the vesicle is perfectly white ; and that at a further
advanced stage, after the vesicle has disappeared, and its place is occupied by a col-
lection of white cells, the dark portion of the yelk till preserves its intense black
colour, except at the point that corresponds to the central cana}, which then has a
leaden hue. PrevosT and Dumas®, and also RuscoxntÞF, have mentioned that there
is a yellow spot at a corresponding part of the dark surface of the egg of the species
they have examined after impregnation, Rana esculenta ?, but these appearances must
