(v) Analysis of the dynamic (oscillatory) state rheology of suspensions of iron particles in alginate solutions
in the presence of an applied magnetic field

Finally, we analysed the effect of an applied magnetic field on the response of samples to
oscillatory shear strains of fixed frequency (1 Hz) and stepwise increasing amplitude (figure 8).
As observed, the application of a magnetic field had a strong impact on the response of the
suspensions. First, under a magnetic field, at low shear strain amplitude, the storage modulus
is higher than the loss modulus, which is characteristic of a viscoelastic solid. The reason is
the aggregation of the particles into chain-like structures under the application of a magnetic
field, which gives to the samples a gel-like microstructure. Note that, for samples based on LVSA
polymer, in the absence of an applied magnetic field, a viscoelastic liquid behaviour (G” > G’) was
obtained. Another remarkable feature of figure 8 is the fact that, as the magnetic field increases,
the magnitudes of both G’ and G” increase, as a consequence of the MR effect. Finally, we observe
the appearance of a maximum in G” under a field in the range 10-100% of strain. These maxima
represent yielding points, for which the magnetic field-induced particle structures are broken by
the applied shear.

We also analysed the behaviour of the samples under oscillatory shear strains of constant
amplitude (within the LVR) and increasing frequency. Results are illustrated for sample 5Fe-
8MVSA as an example in figure 9. As observed, for all the values of the applied magnetic field
under study, both G’ and G” increased with frequency, which is typical of viscoelastic materials.
It is also observed that both G’ and G” increased with the intensity of the applied magnetic field.

Finally, and in order to better analyse the effect of the applied magnetic field, we obtained
