In figure 9a,b, we show the local energy
dissipation ¢(z) = (v/2)((duj/dxj + duj/Axi)*), normalized by u3/H in the permeable-wall case
fU=155. In the bulk region, the local dissipation decreases relatively with respect to U°/H as
Ra increases. The low dissipation should be due to the fact that in two-dimensional flow, there is
no vorticity stretching and thus no small-scale dissipative structure (figure 7). The local energy
dissipation is much higher in the near-wall region, increasing relatively with respect to U°/H
with increasing Ra. This is the reason why the total dissipation ¢ can scale with U°/H in spite of
decreasing ¢/' (U3 /H) with increasing Ra in the bulk region.
