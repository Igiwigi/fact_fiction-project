Here we can, of course, find the explicit solutions. The figs. 3 show the cross-
sections for the cases m/M = 1, 1/1-1 and 1/3.
The values of the two middle frequencies (oF | which will be used later, are given
by
w, = (20 + 2y'/m)! |

: (3.9)
Wa = (2a + 2y'/M)' |}

A very interesting fact is the asymmetry which is apparent in fig. 3c, i. The
extreme points of the middle curves are not given by (3.9) as we might have
expected, but lie on opposite sides of the (05) frequencies. For all practical appli-
cations this shift is, however, so small that (3.9) may be used.

The second set of cross-sections, which we shall use, is given by (41 42) = (5 *)-

These are defined by the equations
X? Y,2 — 422 cos? xX, Y, — 4y’? (Xi? + Yi?) sin? x + 16y"4 sin’ x = 0

where
X, = — mw* + 2a + 2y’, |
