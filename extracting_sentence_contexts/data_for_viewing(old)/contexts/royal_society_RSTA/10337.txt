atmosphere, bringing with it its charge of emanation.

All the facts of the above analysis receive a very simple explanation by this
theory if one extends it to include the fact that, as the emanation is a gas contained
in the soil, it must constantly diffuse into the atmosphere above quite independently
of the state of the barometer. Assuming this constant diffusion, we at once see that
everything which tends to reduce the atmospheric circulation, 1.e., to keep the air
stagnant, tends also to increase the quantity of emanation in the lower layers of the
atmosphere.

Looking now at each of the tables in order, we see that the temperature does not
have a direct, but an indirect influence on the radio-activity. This is explained by
the fact that the low temperature of the winter produces a nearly permanent
temperature inversion, as mentioned above, which entirely prevents ascending
currents of air. Thus the emanation on leaving the ground in cold weather cannot
rise, but collects in the lower atmosphere, causing the high winter values of the radio-
activity.

The reason why the radio-activity is high with high relative humidity is easily
found when one considers that each evening, as the temperature rapidly falls, two
things happen: first there is a rapid rise in the relative humidity and secondly
ascending currents of air are cut off. The latter fact gives rise to the high radio-
activity. Also a mist or fog is always a sign of stagnant air.

A high wind is naturally accompanied by low activity, for it acts as a stirrer, and
