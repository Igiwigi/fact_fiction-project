cannot refrain from pointing out the enormous absolute quantity of electricity
which the animal must put in circulation at each effort. It is doubtful whe-
ther any common electrical machine has as yet been able to supply electricity
sufficient in a reasonable time to cause true electro-chemical decomposition of
water (330. 339.), yet the current from the torpedo has done it. The same
high proportion is shown by the magnetic effects (296. 371.). These circum-
stances indicate that the torpedo has power (in the way probably that Cavex.
prsx describes,) to continue the evolution for a sensi√æble time, s0 that its suc-

cessive discharges rather resemble those of a yoltaic arrangement, intermitting
in its action, than those of a Leyden apparatus, charged and discharged many
times in succession, In reality, however, there is no philosophical difference be-
tween these two cages.

360. The general conclusion which must, I think, be drawn from this col-
lection of facts is, that electricity, whatever may be its $0urce, is identical in its
nature. The phenomena in the five kinds or species quoted, differ not in their
