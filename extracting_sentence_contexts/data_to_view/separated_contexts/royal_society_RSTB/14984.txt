Why
do viewers admire certain objects in museums that they ignore or even abhor in
everyday life? These are only some of the many questions surrounding the
puzzle of aesthetic judgement. In fact, the very concept of ‘aesthetic judgement’ is a puzzle. After all,
interacting with a work of art involves an arch of mutually dependent perceptual,
cognitive and affective processes that generate aesthetic experience [1,2]. Still,
viewers do eventually express their judgements, and researchers in aesthetics
do ask participants for their ratings.
