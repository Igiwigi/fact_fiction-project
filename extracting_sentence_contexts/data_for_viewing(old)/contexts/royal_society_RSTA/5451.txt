In fact, there does seem to operate some sort of complementarity (in the
spirit of Niels Bohr) that makes it difficult to combine physical intuition with
mathematical rigour. The mathematical proofs of conjectures often proceed
not by making the physical intuition more precise, but by taking completely
alternative routes, familiar to mathematicians but foreign to physicists.

Recent ideas from quantum gravity and string theory challenge the
fundamental concepts of geometry at an even deeper level. Physical intuition
ells us that the traditional pseudo-Riemannian geometry of space-time cannot
9e a definite description of physical reality. Quantum corrections in the theory of
gravity will change this picture at distances of the order of the Planck scale.
Familiar fundamental properties such as locality only appear at much larger
scales. In fact, there is now much evidence within string theory—usually referred
o as ‘holography’—that in the end geometry itself is an emergent quantity. The
classical laws of gravity only appear in the limit where the number of degrees
of freedom of the underlying quantum theory is taken to infinity, very similar to
he emergence of the macroscopic laws of thermodynamics out of the microscopic
description of statistical mechanics. The definite mathematical formulation of
such a concept of ‘quantum geometry’ is however still far away.

One could also question whether there exists a single overarching mathematical
structure that captures all these aspects of quantum theory, or whether one
is simply dealing with a combination of different complementary points of
view, like the charts and maps of a manifold. As a whole, the study of
quantum geometry takes on the form of a rich mathematical programme, very
