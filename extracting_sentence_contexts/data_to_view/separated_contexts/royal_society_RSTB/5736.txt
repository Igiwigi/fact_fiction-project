Both sexes of the grey squirrel show diminished general activity during the winter
months and, while there is no true hibernation, squirrels probably sleep during severe
weather (MrppieTon, 1930). In Part IV, Deanesty and Parxss show that sexual
activity in the female is limited to the spring and summer, the reproductive organs
being quiescent throughout the rest of the year. In view of these facts it seemed
probable that the male squirrel would also show seasonal reproductive activity. The
present paper deals with an investigation into this question and also with a study of the
correlation between the size of the testes and that of the accessory reproductive organs. VOL.
