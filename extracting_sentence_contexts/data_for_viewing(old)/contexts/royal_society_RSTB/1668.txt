I have seen and handled all I possibly could of fossil Amphibia and Reptilia,
chiefly through the courtesy of Mr. Anprews and his chief, of the Geological
Department of the Natural History Museum.

Professor K. v. Zrrret had the kindness to lend me the original specimens of
Archegosaurus, described by v. Mryer. Professor A. Gaupry, in reply to some
questions, wrote me a letter which was nothing less than an explanatory discourse.

In the course of this research it became more necessary than ever to learn the
range or amplitude of the modifications of the various elements which enter into the
composition of vertebrae. The extreme variations are not necessarily the exceptions,
more or less abnormal, and therefore to be passed over in silence. On the contrary,
this procedure in the gathering of facts, often revealed as truly normal and important
what had hitherto been considered as insignificant detail. This applies, in the
selection as types, to the individual specimens, and still more forcibly to the larger
groups, as Â¢.g., families from and for which we select the representatives.

The frog is the most glaring example. It possesses scarcely anything typical,
which is also applicable to any other group of vertebrata.

IT have abstained as much as possible from discussing and arguing out some of the
many contentious questions at issue in this paper, but I have tried to show how
certain errors have arisen.

For the rest, for the correctness of the views taken in this essay, the facts
