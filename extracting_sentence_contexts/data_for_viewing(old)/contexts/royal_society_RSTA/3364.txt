(b) Direct deoxygenation on Ti02

The HDO mechanism of phenol is a relevant step in the treatment of biomass to generate
biofuels [11-13]. It can occur according to two main pathways: (i) HYD followed by dehydration;
and (ii) direct deoxygenation (DDO). Our scope is to compare the reactivity of phenol adsorbed
on Rujo clusters deposited on stoichiometric and reduced anatase TiO2(101) surfaces. We have
restricted our analysis to the DDO reaction and we concentrate on the interface region between the
oxide and the metal particle. In particular, we have studied the DDO of phenol via breaking of the
C-OH bond and oxygen removal. The assumption is that Ru nanoparticles of size below 1-2 nm
are present on the surface. In fact, the surface of large Ru particles is very active and leads to C-
OH bond scission with similar and even lower energy barriers [12]. In this case, it is assumed that,
in the presence of hydrogen, the reaction proceeds towards full HYD. In analogy with the study
of ZrO; in the ketonization process, see above, three different forms of anatase TiO? have been
considered: (i) the ideal stoichiometric (101) surface; (ii) the same surface reduced by H addition
and formation of Ti*+ radical ions; and (iii) the surface with one O vacancy and two Ti5+ centres.

We found that on the surface reduced by hydrogen addition (Ti3* ions), the phenol molecular
and dissociative adsorptions (CgHs5+OH fragments) become isoenergetic, and the barrier to
dissociate the C-OH bond is 1.19 eV, indicating a possible channel for deoxygenation of phenol,

On the surface reduced by O vacancies, the dissociative adsorption is 0.22 eV more stable than
