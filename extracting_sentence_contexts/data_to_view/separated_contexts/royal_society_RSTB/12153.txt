Support is also of little con-
cern, as we find ourselves buoyant in the water, although swimming is
energetically expensive compared to walking or running on land. Rather, our
main concern is respiration, which we perceive as getting enough oxygen. Note, however, that our modes of obtaining oxygen underwater, whether via a
snorkel (of limited length) or an oxygen tank, also reflect the fact that our mode
of lung ventilation by expanding our rib cage also does not work well under
the pressure of a column of water. THE ROYAL SOCIETY
