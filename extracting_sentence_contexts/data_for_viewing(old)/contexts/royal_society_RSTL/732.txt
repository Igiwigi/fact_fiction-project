from a great" variety of experiments, very great ; but it will
be very difficult to discover any method by which the extent
of its operation'can be-accurately ascertained. For the vessels
which convey /and impel*' the true sap, or fluid from which
the new wood appears to be generated, pass immediately from
the leaf-stalk' towards the root; and though the motion of this
fluid may be impeded by gravitation, and it be even again
returned into the leaf, no portion of it, unless it had been ex-
travasated, could have descended to the part from which the
bark was taken off in the experiment I have described. I am
not sensible that in the. different Papers which I have had the
honour to address to you, I have drawn any other inference
which the facts, on repetition of the experiments, do not appear
capable of s1pporting.

I am, &c,
