empirically the statistical properties of the sub-gridscale processes and how they
relate to the large-scale, resolved state of the atmosphere (or ocean). Traditionally,
a deterministic approach has been taken to define these bulk formulae and their
closure parameters, despite the fact that considerable uncertainty exists and
observations suggest a significant range of possible formulations and values. Therefore, it is clear that uncertainty in the model itself, and systematic biases
in the modelâ€™s simulation lead to restricted sampling of the forecast phase space
and under-dispersion in the ensemble. Early studies investigated the role of model
uncertainty and used random perturbations to the increments from the physical
parametrizations, time step by time step [7], while other approaches used random
variations to the closure parameters in the physical parametrizations.
