The publication on The purity of sacred lotus [11] was rejected for publication by five renowned
journals; the reviewers were not ready for a change in paradigms in surface technologies. In
2016, the lotus effect (Barthlott and Neinhuis [11]) had gained almost 4000 citations according
to Google Scholar (compare figure 7). Indian and Chinese co-workers and students drew
our attention to the fact that the remarkable properties of the lotus were mentioned in the
ancient texts of the Bhagavad-Gita and in Chinese writings. The properties of the lotus were
traditional knowledge in Hinduism and Buddhism; in contrast, there was a complete omission
the general western knowledge at the time. The usage of the term ‘lotus effect’, closely followed
by ‘superhydrophobic’, shows the remarkable increase (figure 7) starting in 1990, based on the
data supplied by the Institute of Scientific Information (ISI).
