The Baron de Born has mentioned a grey cupreous pyrites,
which, he says, contains go per cent. of copper. I have ana-
lyzed a similar one from Cornwall, (grey vitreous copper ore,
page 203.) which I found to contain 86 of the. same metal,
But, if we reflect, not s0 much on the quantity as upon the
extreme purity of this copper, and the wonderful facility with
which this useful metal may be extracted, it will be found much
superior to every copper ore hitherto discovered. It would be
well worth the attention of miners, to keep a constant look out
for this substance, which, I am informed, is not rare in Corn-
wall. It contains no iron, and no sulphur; the absence of which
latter is a peculiar advantage. It is a fact not generally known,
I believe, that there is hardly such a thing in commerce, as cop-
per which does not contain a little sulphur ; at least I have rarely
met with any such; and it requires but a very minute portion
of sulphur, to increase the fusibility of copper. "The advantage
of obtaining copper free from sulphur, is too obvious to require
to be pointed out; and that advantage does this ore possess,

To work it separately, if ever it should be found in sufficient
quantity, would well repay the labour it would cost; and a very
