In the
result it appeared that the value of log 7! could be more and more nearly calculated by

adding on successive terms of a series proceeding by powers of = The error is of the
a

order of magnitude of the term of the series next after the one at which we stop. And, most important fact of all, the series is divergent. If n! be replaced by T(x + 1), a similar result can be obtained, which holds for all
real positive values of 7. Finally, there comes the enquiry as to what meaning, if any, can be attached to the
equality in the case in which 7 is any complex quantity.
