moderate altitude. The constants given above refer to light making an angle not
exceeding 35° with the normal to the surface. The following figures} show the cor-
rection factor f by which the reading of a horizontal photometer should be multi-
plied for light of altitude «°.

Integration of the effect of a uniform sky shows that for such the factor should be
1-06, i.e., the same as that for sunlight of altitude 30°. For many daylight measure-
ments, therefore, it is sufficiently accurate to multiply the constant of the cell, as
found for illumination at normal incidence, by 1-06. This has, in fact, been our
usual practice, except in a few cases in which we have been especially interested in
comparing sunlight and sky light, for each of which we have then used the appropriate
factor.

SENSITIVITY OF THE CELL SURFACES

In order to get an idea of the intrinsic sensitivity of the surfaces of the various
cells, tests were made, using definite areas or apertures, upon the bare cells. As
sources the lamp at 2360° K (new scale) was used, both alone and as modified to
give “‘ mean noon sunlight.”
