The muscle which is called by Kravss
the basio-humeralis, presents, I believe, strong grounds for referring its homology to the
cleido-mastoid of human anatomy. First, its lower attachment to the clavicle and its
participation in the formation of the levator humers is upon this supposition at once
explained, Tts deep poxition in relation to the muscles marked « and c, viz. the sterng-
mastoid and cleido-occipital, is also more in accordance with this supposition: Its origin
from the basilar process takes place close to the suture between it and the mastoid bone,
some of its fibres even arising from the latter. Its deep displacement may in fact be

= referred to the great development of the tympanic element necessary to support the
NY enormous ears of the animal, at the expense of the occipital and mastoid development,
E which are small and compressed. A comparison of the relative position of the three
= muscles marked a, 6, and & in the figures of the Rabbit, with those of the Hedgehog
= (Plate XI. fig. 22), and especially with those of its congeners, the Squirrel (Plate X,
Sd fig. 18), and the Norway Rat (fig. 19 and fig. 26, Plate XL.), will render the resemblance
S of the muscles herein treated as homologous, more plain than any description, and will
5 tend to remove the confusion into which, by want of precision, the names of these mus-
= cles haye been plunged. The relation of the musele to the true Tevator clavicule (6) is
Z thus one of juxtaposition merely, and not one of derivation.
