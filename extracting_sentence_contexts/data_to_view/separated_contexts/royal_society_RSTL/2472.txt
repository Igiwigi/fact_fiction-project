This I take to be the true nature of the disengagement of the organs of motion in
the Annulosa; but if we regard this to take place in Zoea, we hall necessarily have
two conditions totally at variance with the principles of ecdysis, viz. that an exist-
ing organ in a state of incomplete development incloses only a single organ, —thus,
the wings of the Grasshopper are not inclosed within the legs of its larva; and that
an organ disengaged by the shedding of its envelope is always larger than such en-

the hardness of their outer covering preventing their growth, except by the shedding
of such covering. Secondly, We may imagine that the five pairs of minute rudimental legs of the
future Crab are not transformed from the two pairs of natatory limbs, but are totally
