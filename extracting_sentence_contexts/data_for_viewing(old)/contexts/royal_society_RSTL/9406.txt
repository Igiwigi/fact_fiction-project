solution represents a nutation the amplitude of which increases with the time.

The critical point where the above integration stops is given by 2008 4, and this

2
critical point by =1 +47 ; it follows therefore that 2 is little larger in the second

cage than in the first. Therefore this critical point has not been already reached where
the integration stops, but will occur shortly afterwards.

It is obvious that the amplitude of the nutation cannot increase for an indefinite
time, because the critical relationship is only exactly satisfied for a single instant.
In fact, the problem is one of far greater complexity than that of ordinary disturbed
rotation. The sysbem is disturbed periodically, but the periodic time of the disturb-
ance slowly increases, passing through a phase of equality to the free periodic time ;
the problem is to find the amplitude of the oscillations when they are at their maximum,
and to find the mean configuration of the system some time before and some time
after the maximum, when the oscillations are small. This problem does not seem to
be soluble, unless we take into account the slow variation of the argument in the
periodic disturbing term ; and when the argument varies, the disturbing term is not
strietly a simple time harmonic.

In the cage of the viscous spheroid, the question would be further complicated by
the fact that when the nutation becomes large, a new 8eries of bodily tides is 8et up
by the effects of inertia.
