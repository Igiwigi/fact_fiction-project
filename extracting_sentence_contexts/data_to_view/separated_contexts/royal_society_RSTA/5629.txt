The picture from Ref.
[6] leads to an interpretation of this as confirmation that transitioning to a non-abelian quantum
field theory preserves the normal expectation from a classical analogy. Formally, the longitudinally polarized gluons simply get absorbed into the Wilson line
operators of separate parton densities, where they appear to play the purely formalistic role of
ensuring gauge invariance for parton densities. The Wilson lines are rather abstract objects, but
they essentially just account for the fact that a colliding parton must pass through a background
field on its way in or out of a hard collision, similar to the description in figure 5. The phases
accumulated along those paths need to be accounted for to preserve formal gauge invariance in
parton densities. But at least in the simplest and most highly inclusive cases, they do not impact
the general overall partonic picture.
