In seismic codes, uncertainties involved in the seismic assessment of existing structures are
generally treated by simply introducing discrete knowledge levels and associating with each of
them a value of the so-called confidence factor. The latter is a reduction factor to be applied to
material strength and stiffness, and is supposed to account for all sources of uncertainty involved
in the assessment. Despite the simplicity of this approach, several drawbacks are associated with
it [6], one of which being the fact that it is unable to correctly account for the additional knowledge
that can be acquired by means of the new experimental data [7]. In recent decades, the Bayesian approach has been proven to be an effective theoretical
framework for dealing with different sources of uncertainty. The Bayes theorem is commonly
employed to derive a posterior probability distribution of a set of uncertain parameters according
to both their prior probability distribution (i.e. an initial knowledge about their possible range
of values) and the likelihood of the observed data.
