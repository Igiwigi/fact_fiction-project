two lightest degrees attained among the normal ones ; but when, on the other hand,
the head was in gilt surroundings the pupze never reach the two darkest degrees of
the normal pup. But such conclusions are quite upset by the further comparison
with the far more trustworthy results of the pupee which were covered for the whole
of Stage III. Here also the pupz in tubes with the gilt chamber below are rather
lighter, but the others, although not equally light, are lighter than the free pups. It
has been suggested above that the free pups are about normal, and I think that
this suggestion is confirmed by a comparison with the pups: found on the food-plant
and in the cylinders in which the stock was kept (see below, D.) The influence of
a colour—black or gold-—felt by a larva must be immensely different according as the
latter is inside a tube or outside it, and it may well be that the effects in the last case
are so slight as to be often inappreciable when the stimulus has been applied during
Stage IIL. only. Certainly in the above-described experiments the facts of one set of
free pupse seeming to indicate a slight influence are compensated by those of the next,
in which the results are highly irregular. I believe, however, that the effects were
real in a few instances, although very slight, but there is insufficient evidence for the
belief in these experiments alone.

Assuming, then, that the free pupz are not far from normal, we see that the pupe
in tubes for the whole of Stage III. are lighter, whatever be the position of the gilt
chamber; the gold has a more powerful influence than the black with either system of
relative position, But such results are quite inconsistent with the theory that the
larval ocelli are influenced by the colour, for it is seen that the gold produces effects
when it is shut off from the anterior part of the body together with the head. The
