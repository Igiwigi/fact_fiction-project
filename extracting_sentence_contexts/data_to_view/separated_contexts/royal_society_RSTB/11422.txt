Clini-
cians and educators recognize the value of these books both
in promoting children’s understanding of the realities of
death and in stimulating communication between children
and their parents [59]. In the USA, a now-famous episode of
the children’s television show Mister Rogers’ neighbourhood
focused on the death of a goldfish [60,61]. This episode ‘dealt
with death in a low-anxiety situation’ [60, p. 183] and was
explicit in providing factual information about the death
sub-concepts of irreversibility, universality and cessation. The
producers received numerous letters from parents and children
expressing thanks for the programme and providing examples
of how the programme helped them deal with the realities of
death [60]. The programme was repeated several times over
the next few years.
