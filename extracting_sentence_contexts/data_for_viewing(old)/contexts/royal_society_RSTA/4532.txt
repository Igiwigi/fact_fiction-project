outcome-uncertain condition than in the time-uncertain condition. One might therefore argue
that the effect of the experimental manipulation can be explained by differences in the amount of
information that the projections contained. However, this explanation seems unlikely given that
increasing the amount of information should strengthen rather than weaker people’s responses
to the projections.

Second, many of the projections in the outcome uncertain condition were presented in
both metric and imperial terms (temperature rise in degrees Celsius and Fahrenheit, sea-
level rise in centimetres and inches, and Arctic ice reduction in square kilometres and square
miles). It is therefore possible that the outcome-uncertain projections were more difficult for
respondents to comprehend. Lack of comprehension may therefore be an alternative explanation
for respondents having weaker responses to outcome-uncertain projections. However, differences
in comprehension between the two conditions should be limited by the fact that the graphs
presented to respondents were identical across conditions (except for the blue line expressing the
uncertainty). Furthermore, all respondents successfully completed comprehension items prior to
starting the survey.

As this study is the first to have demonstrated a beneficial effect of time-uncertain presentation
(to our knowledge), and in the light of the limitations addressed above, future work should seek


to replicate the finding. Moreover, in this study, participants’ responses were operationalized in
the form of self-report measures. It would be useful to examine whether the findings translate
into differences in observable behaviour. These findings have implications for practical efforts
aimed at educating non-scientific audiences on the anticipated consequences of climate change.
