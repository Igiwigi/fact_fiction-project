The synchronously vibrating material molecules would not in any case give rise to further absorption
by sending out energy in regular secondary waves: their uniformity in distribution and phase prevent
this, just as they prevent the separate elements of the continuous wther from acting in the same way.
The dust particles which give rise to the blue sky are irregularly distributed, and the individual
secondary waves thence originating have irregular and independent phase-differences with reference to


THE ELECTRIC AND LUMINIFEROUS MEDIUM. 247

Prismatic Deviation by Opaque Media.

34, The fact that light preserves its period shows (Part I., § 90) that the cireum-
stances of its propagation across opaque media are determined simply by a complex
index of refraction, of which the imaginary part represents the absorption. Measures
of deviation by opaque prisms, such as those made by Kunvt, yield directly the value
of this complex index, by simple consideration of the geometrical continuity of the
traces of the waves along the interfaces, without the necessity of the intervention of
any dynamical theory whatever and therefore free of all ambiguity of interpretation.
The thickness of the portion of the prism that is traversed does not affect the devia-
tion of the light ; so it may be taken as null, and we have only to consider refraction
into the prism, and then out of it at a plane inclined at an angle differing by «, the
angle of the prism, without changing the point of incidence. Let the axis of « be in
the first face of the prism, towards the edge, that of y normal to it and that of z
parallel to the edge. Then for the incident, reflected, and refracted waves, of period
