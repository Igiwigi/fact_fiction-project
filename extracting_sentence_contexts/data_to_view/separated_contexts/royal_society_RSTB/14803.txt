Consequently, as a person becomes fatter (and also
of FFM and FM, and the state of energy balance (positive, accrues FFM) they will display a stronger drive to eat

negative or in balance). accompanied by a weakening inhibition, i.e. a reduction in


the strength of the signals that suppress eating. Therefore,
people living with obesity do not receive any help from
their increasing amounts of stored energy (as fat) to constrain
their appetite. In fact the opposite is true; appetite self-control
becomes more difficult. There is another social implication of
the physiological determinants of the drive to eat. It is clearly
observed that people with a high BMI (living with obesity)
consume more energy than lean people.
