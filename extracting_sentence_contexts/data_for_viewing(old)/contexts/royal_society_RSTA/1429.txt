However, load imbalances per process may occur due to irregular domains and corresponding
decompositions. In particular, the computational load varies significantly, for example, between
cloudy and cloud-free areas. In this case, it makes sense to model

tcomput(1) — fimbalance(1)

fcomput(N) N + timbalance(N)

with temporal evolution timbalance(N) for the imbalanced compute part. The latter is, however,
very complex to deduce analytically, due to the aforementioned state-dependency argument on
cloudy areas and the fact that simulation models comprise up to millions of lines-of-code.
