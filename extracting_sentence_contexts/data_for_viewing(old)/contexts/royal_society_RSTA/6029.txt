simulation. It is evident (figures 4-7) that the relaxed micromorphic model gives excellent results
for a wide range of frequencies (broadband) and for more than just the angles used to fit the
parameters (anisotropy), and this for both pressure and shear waves.

(c) Exploring larger structures via the relaxed micromorphic material

In this subsection, we explore the meta-structure’s scattering behaviours for increasingly
bigger metamaterial samples. This study would not have been possible via detailed numerical
simulations of real structures due to the non-linearly increasing computational time. For the
sake of brevity, we only present results for pressure incident waves, since the ones for the shear
waves are completely analogous. It is possible to infer from figures 8 and 9 that the scattered field
changes radically while changing the size of the shield. This fact is of great importance to optimize
shielding devices in terms of the scattered field: while it is quite simple to design a metamaterial
shield, it is not possible nowadays to optimize the reflected wave, but here, a calibration of the
size of the shield gives the possibility of exploring the reflected energy and/or to focus energy
on the metamaterial’s boundary or in the near surrounding of the shield. This, in turn, makes it
possible to focus energy in specific points for eventual subsequent re-use.

Localization effects on the metamaterial’s boundaries can be observed in both figures 8 and 9,
indicating that the size of the considered sample has a great influence in this respect. It is not the
object of the present paper to attempt an optimization of this effect in view of energy harvesting.
This will be the object of subsequent works.
