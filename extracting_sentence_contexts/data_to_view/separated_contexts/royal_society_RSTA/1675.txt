and became heavy at about the time when the record ceased. The effect of the rain is shown by the downward slope of the latter portion of the
trace, which indicates a flow of positive electricity from the earth through the
capillary electrometer to the test-plate. How much of this positive charge went to
increase the induced positive charge on the test-plate (on account of increasing
negative potential gradient) and how much to neutralise a negative charge carried
down to the test-plate by rain drops, or by ions travelling under the influence of the
negative potential gradient, remains undetermined owing to the fact that the cover
was not replaced until after the record was completed. Fig. 5 (June 17, 1917, 20h. 28m, 23s.
