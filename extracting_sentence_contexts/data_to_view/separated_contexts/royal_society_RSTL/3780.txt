The finking
of the water in the neck of the matraſs ſeems to be
a general phznomenon attending the ſolution of all
falts ; the quantity of the deſcent is various from 7;
to * of the whole elevation in thoſe falts which I
have tried. In forming the table, | repeated many
of the experiments, but found no variation which
could affe& the general concluſion; with particular
attention I repeated the ſolution of vitriolated tartar,
for I thought it a very. remarkable citcumſtance that
one of the hardeſt ſalts ſhould be more diminiſhed
in proportion to its whole bulk than any other, but
the numbers in the table 22 and 11 accurately ex-
prefled the height before and after ſolution upon the
repetition of the experiment, ſo that it may be relied
upon as aicertain fact that a cubic inch of vitriolated
tartar js by ſolution in water reduced to half a-cubic
inch, though the water cannot, as appeared from an
experiment I made, abſorb th part, nor, as I
believe, any part, of that ſalt without being augment-
ed in magnitude. It is evident from the table that
fal gemme, blue vitriol, corroſive ſublimate, calcined
vitriol, and in general thoſe falts which retain the leaſt
water in their compoſition and. conftitute the hardeſt
maſſes, fink more in proportion to their reſpective
bulks than any other.
