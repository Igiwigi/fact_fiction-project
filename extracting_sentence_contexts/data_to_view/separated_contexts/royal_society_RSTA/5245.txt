Marine observation technology is developing at an
extraordinary rate, with the advent of increasingly complex autonomous surface and subsurface
vehicles from which increasingly complex sensors are being deployed. The technology to deploy
cabled observatories is now also very well developed. Nor is there a lack of willingness to
deploy this new technology; in fact the rush to deploy all these ‘new toys’ makes the need for
a coordinated network all the more urgent. However, one barrier is the potential for a lack of agreed priorities and responsibility among
the multiple stakeholders. Figure 6 [28] attempts to brigade the stakeholders into four broad
categories of user: policy, science, voluntary and industry.
