cone is also faced with platinum. The neck of B is furnished with a cork, P, through
which passes the vertical tube Q, open at both ends. This portion of the apparatus
must be scrupulously air-tight. The lower end of Q dips into a wide vyessel of coloured

642 FREDERICK GUTHRIE ON THE THERMAL RESISTANCE OF LIQUIDS:

The lower cone and tube form in fact an air-thermometer, the liquid in the stem of
which may be adjusted to any height.

$ 23. The platinum surfaces of the cone bases are ground optically flat and polished *.
When breathed npon and brought into contact, they fit one another 80 exactly that the
one may be almost lifted by the other, owing to their adhesion. Before being used,
they are washed in succession with hot caustic 80da, nitric acid, alcohol, and water.

Q 24. It is clear that if the micrometer-screw is read when the cones are in actual
contact, and again when they have been removed to some considerable distance (sï¬†y 10
millims.), we know how much the screw must be turned to give a motion of 1 millim.
In my apparatus 1-06 turn of the screw corresponds to 1 millim., and as the screw-head
is divided into 100 parts, it is easy to adjust the distance of the platinum faces from one
