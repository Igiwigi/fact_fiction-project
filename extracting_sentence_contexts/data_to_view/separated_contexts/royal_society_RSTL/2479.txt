At first sight, in addition to and immediately succeeding the two pairs
of maxillze, there appear only two pairs of large locomotive bipartite organs. These
therefore, on the supposition that the Zoe is the young of a Decapod animal, must
either be legs, or outer foot-jaws greatly developed ; and from their bipartite struc-
ture, the latter may be partly assumed ; but upon carefully dissecting the animal, a
series of organs were found, which not only fully proved this to be the case, but also
led at once to the discovery of the real nature of these animals, and gave a clue for
the correction of Mr. TnomesoN's ideas upon the supposed disengagement of the tho-
racic limbs. Immediately succeeding the outer pair of the natatory organs, and, in
fact, lying between them when at rest, was discovered a pair of slender minute
organs, composed apparently of two joints, one long and one $hort, and furnished at
the base with a still more minute lateral appendage. Beyond these, in succession,
were found the five pairs of organs precisely similar to Mr. TaowmesoNn's © limbs of
the future Crab disengaged from heneath the clypeus.” Moreoyer, a number (unde-
termined) of minute fleshy elongated masses were found near and attached to the
base of these limbs.
