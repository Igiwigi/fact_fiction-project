and the period, supposing « constant, would be about 25,000 years, i. e. in one fourth
of that period the part of solar nutation dependent on the term we are discussing would
pass from zero to about 1000 seconds. If, however, we suppose the s0lid shell of our
spheroid to increase in thickness at the same rate as the crust of the earth, the dif-
ference between @ and @' would possibly not remain within the yalue just mentioned
for nearly 80 long as 6000 years ; in which case, supposing the inequality to be zero
when « — «' should equal about 130 feet, it could never afterwards amount to nearly
1000 seconds ; nor could it haye been previously 80 great, because its previous values
must have corresponded to values of a — @' less than the above value. Our investi-
gation, however, does not tell us whether 120 or 130 feet would be near the value of
a — @ the last time the secular inequality should yanish before a became = «', and
consequently we cannot say with certainty that 1000 seconds would be the extreme
limit to which the inequality would attain. In fact, the exact determination of this
limit would require the very accurate determination of a as a function of Z, which
cannot be known in the case of the earth's crust without an accurate knowledge of
the conductive power of the matter which constitutes it. From the small yalue, how-
ever, of a — «' and great length of the period corresponding to the maximum of 1000”
for the inequality we have been considering, it may perhaps be deemed extremely
improbable that it should ever exceed that yalue in the case of the earth. The dura-
tion of time for which the effect of the cause we are discussing on solar nutation
would be sensible to obseryation would be, that necessary for the thickening of the
earth's crust s0 to increase that a — «' should pass from + (6 or 8 miles) to — (6 or
8 miles), and might therefore be approximately determined if the quantity denoted
by » in this article were known.
