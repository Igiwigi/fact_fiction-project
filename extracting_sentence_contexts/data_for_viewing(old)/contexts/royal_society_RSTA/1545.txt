(a) Verification, validation, reproducibility and replication

Verification and validation of computational models—often abbreviated V&V and viewed in
concert—have developed into a mature subject with more than two decades of organized efforts
to standardize it, dedicated conferences, and a journal. The American Society of Mechanical
Engineers (ASME), a standards-developing organization, formed its first Verification and
Validation committee (known as V&V 10) in 2001, with the charter: ‘To develop standards for
assessing the correctness and credibility of modelling and simulation in computational solid
mechanics’. It approved its first document in 2006: The Guide for Verification and Validation in
Computational Solid Mechanics (known as V&V 10-2006). The fact that this guide was 5 years in
the making illustrates just how complex the subject matter, and building consensus about it, can
be. Since that first effort, six additional standards sub-committees have tackled V&V in a variety
of contexts. V&V 70 is the latest, focused on machine-learning models. The key principles laid out
in the first V&V standard persevere through the many subsequent efforts that have operated to
this day. They are:

— Verification must precede validation.
— Needs for validation experiments and associated accuracy requirements for
computational model predictions are based on the intended use of the model.


— Validation of a complex system should be pursued in a hierarchical fashion from the 3 |
