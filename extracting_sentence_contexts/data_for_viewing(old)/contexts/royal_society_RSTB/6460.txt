with the flat serous epithelium of the pedicle. x 78.

Fic. 9—M.M. 22. Similar to fig. 8, but from a Guinea baboon, Papio papio. x 50.

Fic. 10—O.M. 20. Hydatid of Type III from a mature rhesus monkey, M. mulatta. x 40.
Fic. 11—O.M. 35, Hydatid of Type IV from a green monkey, Cercopithecus aethiops sabaeus.
The hydatid is attached to the testis and has a central duct that opens into the sac of the tunica
vaginalis. x 70.

Fic. 12—O.M. 144, Hydatid of Type III from a rhesus monkey that had been injected with
oestrone. Note the large number of tubular invaginations of the surface columnar epithelium.
The folds they produce are to be distinguished from the more prominent ones shown in fig. 10,
and which give the hydatid a fimbriated appearance. Note also the fact that the stroma is
more densely packed than it is in normal specimens. x 75.
