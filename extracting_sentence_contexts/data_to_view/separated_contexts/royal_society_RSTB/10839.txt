The idea of an RNA world goes back to the
late 1960s [5-7] and pleasingly solves the chicken-and-egg problem of which
came first, DNA (which is mostly inert and cannot copy itself) or protein
(which is catalytic, but has properties that are specified by DNA). Because
RNA is capable of both catalysis and replication, it could theoretically have
been central to the origins of heredity, and so life itself [5-7]. The fact that
RNA remains the crucial intermediary between DNA and proteins reinforces
this view. Plainly RNA was central to early evolution and the origin of the
genetic code. But there are some practical difficulties with the RNA-world hypothesis in
its strongest form—the idea that ribozymes ‘invented’ metabolism as well as the
genetic code.
