Again, t
Graminaceous crop, requiring for full produce snch direct supply of available Ni \!
within the s0il, is very much increased, beyond what it would be if it 8ueceeded a crop j
of the same description, when it follows a Leguminous crop, in which has been F
off 80 much Nitrogen. ,
Experiments such as those now specially under. consideration can obviously bear
upon a few only of the cireumstances with which may be connected the causes of this
aifference between the Graminaceous and the Leguminous crops. Without, therefore,
pretending adequately to discuss this wide subject, we will consider it only s0 far as our
facts appear to bear upon it; they seem to limit us to the consideration of
f

immediate
the following cases :â€”

1. The difference may be due to the decomposition of nitrogenous compounds during
the growth of the Graminaceous plants, and to the evolution of free Nitrogen. b

2.
