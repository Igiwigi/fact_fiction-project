(i) IT — A)“ || = O01 /M~(f) as t > 00;
(ii) iR C p(A) and ||R(is, A)|| =O(M(\s|)) as |s| > oo.

Note that, as the analysis of multiplication semigroups in [87, Section 5.1] reveals, the class
of functions of positive increase is the largest possible class for which the resolvent estimate
|R(is, A)|| < M(|sl), s € R, implies the decay rate ||T(t)A~*|| = O(1/M~1(f)) as t + 00; see also [93].

It sometimes happens in applications that a resolvent estimate on iR is known only
along a subsequence. To clarify this situation and complement Theorem 3.4, observe that
if M:R,— (0,00) is a continuous increasing function such that M(s)— oo as s— oo and
lim sup jg), 50 M(\s|)7}| R(is, A)|| > 0, then there exists c > 0 such that lim sup,_, 5 M71 (ct) || T((L -
A)71|| >0, and if M has positive increase then the latter inequality holds for all c > 0; see [95,
Proposition 5.4]. In fact, the same applies more generally to bounded Co-semigroups on Banach
spaces.

Exponential and semi-uniform stability with polynomial rates can also be approached by
means of Fourier multiplier techniques. We are unable to discuss this approach in our short
survey, and we instead refer to the interesting recent paper [96] (and the references therein) for
details. In particular, the paper contains versions of Theorem 3.5 for unbounded semigroups; see
e.g. [96, Section 4].

4. Applications to second-order Cauchy problems

Since this survey emphasizes abstract aspects we found it instructive, in passing to descriptions
of illustrative applications of our techniques, to begin with a discussion of an abstract model and
