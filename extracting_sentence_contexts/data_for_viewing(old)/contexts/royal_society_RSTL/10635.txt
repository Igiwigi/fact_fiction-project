i" 25-31.
S Fig. 25, through the upper portion of the lesion, shows the temporo-sphenoidal con-
Folution destroyed with the exception of a narrow strip immediately posterior to the
"—_ of SYLvIUs. Fig. 26, at a lower level, shows the medullary fibres completely
Hevered. Figs. 27, 28, and 29 present similar appearances, showing the sinus made by
She cautery, hollowing out and almost completely severing the medullary fibres of the
Euperior temporo-sphenoidal convolution ; while in figs. 30 and 31 the sinus only
 —— the posterior half of this convolation.

LY Remarks. —This case shows that bilateral destruction of the superior temporo-

henoidal convolution causes loss of hearing without any other defect either in the
omain of motion or sensation. The fact of deaſness in this animal was admittedly

Axtabliched before the Physiological section of the International Medical Congress
in 1881.

The position of the lesion is proved by the photographs and sections to be in the
cortex and medullary fibres of the superior temporo-sphenoidal convolutions, where it
was stated to be. On the left side the destruction was most complete ; on the right
the destruction was not quite complete at the lower half, But the destruction was
Sufficient to cause s8uch loss of hearing that no evidence could be obtained free from
doubt that this continued even in a slight degree.
