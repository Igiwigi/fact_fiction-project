included in the order Stegocephala of Corr.

The Mierosmria are characterized by somewhat narrow crania, 8mooth cranial
bones, simple or non-plicated teeth, well-developed limb bones and ribs, elongated
hiconcave vertebrae, bony plates and scales on the thorax and abdomen, *_ horny
scales on the back and sides.

Though probably to be included in the group Stegocephala, as defined, and
predominantly Batrachian in their affinities, they presented in form, clothing, and
probably in habits of life, a close approximation to the lacertians. Their predomi-
nating terrestrial habits are evidenced by the cireumstance thab in nearly all the |
species the length of the femur coincides very nearly with that of the mandible, while
their lacertian form is indicated by the fact that in death their crania and skeletons
lie on one side and nob on the back or front.
