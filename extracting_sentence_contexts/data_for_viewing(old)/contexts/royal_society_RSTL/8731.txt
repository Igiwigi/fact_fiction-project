They were either isolated or in couples, and exhibited only slight oscillatory moye-
ment. The most characteristic features, however, were the following :—

(a) Tawmps of a pale transparent swbstance containing very irregularly distributed
smaller and larger granules, the smaller granules being pale and indefinite, the larger
ones very bright and highly refractive.

(5) Spheres generally considerably larger than the spheres above mentioned, at least
twice as large. They were arranged in small groups, chiefly composed of couples or of
necklace-like chains.

These spheres were different from the above-mentioned ones, not only in their being
larger, but chiefly by the fact that they were bordered by a sharp line as if by a mem-
brane, whereas their contents appeared perfectly transparent. 'They correspond to the
spheres figured by SaxDeRs0N, and to the spheres (transparent) in Conx's figure, only
that they are generally larger than the dark solid granules, and not of equal size as
represented in ConN's figure.

(c) Groups consisting of the highly refractive mall spheres above named and the
granules mentioned under (4). They are also represented in Conx's figure in Vircmow's
« Archiv,” with the difference that the transparent spheres are always larger than the
solid highly refractive ones. On careful examination of these groups of mixed spheres,
it is found that there are all transitional forms between the two kinds of spheres which
