halla series. While the possibility is entertained by some geologists that these beds
might be Lower Devonian, the Geological Survey of Victoria regards the whole Walhalla
series and the underlying Jordan River Series as constituting the Upper Silurian (Yer-
ingian).

2. The chief plant-remains are: Hostimella sp., smooth branched axes, without and
with axillary “ buds,” occasionally with a branch in this position; vascular strands,
composed of annular tracheides ; Zosterophyllum australianum, n. sp.; Sporogonites
Chapmani, n. sp. ; remains of uncertain nature, including a reticulate incrustation and
spore-like bodies.

3. The various plant-remains mentioned under (2) are fully described and figured. In
the case of Zoslerophyllum additional facts required for comparison are recorded for the
British species (Z. myretonianum).

4. These fossil plants are comparable with some known from the Early Devonian
(Middle and Lower Devonian) of Europe. They clearly indicate such an age for the
Centennial beds, and since two forms can be placed in Lower Devonian genera this
age appears the more probable. While this conclusion at present applies only to the
horizon of the Centennial beds in the Walhalla series, it indicates the need of caution in
