E letters containing valuable hints and suggestions bearing on the interpretation of the
A results.

The boxes used were each capable of holding thirty 6-ounce bottles, the bottom of
the box being lined with felt, and the bottles kept in position by perforated frames,
also lined with felt. The tops of the corks in the bottles were exactly level with the
top of the box, so as to be in contact with the lid when closed, preventing all
possibility of movement, and yet avoiding all need for special packing. The efficacy
of the arrangement is apparent from the fact that not one of the 4100 samples was
lost through a breakage in transit.

The bottles were made of ordinary blue glass, and were supplied by Messrs. Barrp
and TaTLock.
