E The lines which evolution took in producing the large number of genera of
z Primnoacee, Gorgonacee, &e., are much more difficult to make ont, but the following
represents perhaps as near an approximate to them as our present knowledge permits. 2 Taking Siphonogorgic as a form intermediate between the ancestral type and the
3 true Gorgonide, we find that the chief diversion lies in the fact that the colony has
ES, assumed an arborescent shape, and a support for ib is produced by a more copious
& development of spicules in the axial portions of the colony. The body-cavities of the
8. polyps, however, remain long, as they were in the ancestral form.
