Gentlemen,

Read Nov. 9, HE. ſubject of converſation of late

i bp having often turn'd upon that in-

different lengths, in different ſeaſons of the year, by
the effects of heat and cold ; and it having been often
aſked, who was the inventor of it, I have therefore
"thought proper to draw up the following hiſtorical
account of it : And as this account contains nothing

inequalities in their motion ; which were imagined
to arife from the pendulum, in its vibrations, de-
ſcribing an are of a circle ; and, conſequently, that
the larger vibrations mult be flower than the ſhorter
