characteristic polynomial of a qua element of A is ¢?"(x) ... 62¢ (x) mod p. Since a is primitive
for A, it is seen that the ¢,(x) are mutually incongruent mod p, and that

It follows that ¢ = ¢; with a suitable arrangement of the suffixes, the ¢;(x) may be identified
with the respective g,(x), and the A; equated to the /;, Because the ¢,(x) are mutually in,
congruent mod p, ¢{1(2).A; = A; when j+1; that is to say, gj(#).A; = A; when j+-1; anc
of course g'(a) annihilates A,. Hence

a relation which is equivalent to G.(p, gt(a)) = (pS),,-
The rest of the theorem, except for the equation p; = n;/,, is included in (9.5) and Theorem 20

The fact that p; = n,/; is an immediate consequence of Theorem 8.
The following result is a partial converse of Theorem 12:

(7.4) If p is maximal, and R/p has characteristic zero, and if the exponent of (pS)q is
equal to its depth for all i = 1,...,¢, then G/pG has a primitive element over R/p.

In that case the exponent and depth are finite, by (4.12). The theorems of § 9 are therefore
