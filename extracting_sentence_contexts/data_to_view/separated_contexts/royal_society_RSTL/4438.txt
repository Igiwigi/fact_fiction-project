All oxide was thus conyerted into chloride, The fluid
was now filtered from the residue and the hydrochloric acid washed out, the bulk of the
solid substance being till kept in the flask in which the experiment was made. From
this residue, consisting of chloride of silver and metallic silver, the silver was extracted
by boiling with nitric acid, the substance on the filter being added to the rest and
the filter also treated with acid. The solution was diluted and the silver dissolved,
which was in fact the silver reduced, estimated as chloride. It is plain, that whether
the oxide were reduced to metal or to a lower degree of oxidation, this silver must
ï¬†ill be a correct measure of the oxygen lost. This method of determining the loss of
oxygen I followed in all the experiments with silver compounds.
