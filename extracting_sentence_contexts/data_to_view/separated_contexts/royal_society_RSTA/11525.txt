If we take A equal to zero, ReGNautt’s experiments give
0°248 for the specific heat. If we take for A the mean between the two extreme
values, zero and ReGNautt’s value, the specific heat works out to 0°242, which is in
close agreement with my own value, 0°2422. The above criticism applies not only to
the work of RreGNnautt, but also to most of the more recent measurements of the
specific heats of gases at constant pressure, and it is possibly owing to this fact that
these measurements give values for the specific heats which are so much lower than
my own values and the theoretical values.

(24) The Specific Heat of Carbon Diowide.—The carbon dioxide was supplied by
the manufacturers in iron bottles, each bottle containing about 20 Ib. of liquid CO,. A preliminary test showed that the gas contained about 0°5 to 0°7 per cent. of air and
about 0°5 to 0°7 per cent. of water vapour. It was consequently necessary to pass it
through the drying apparatus used in the experiments on_air, the KOH tower was,
however, replaced by a tower containing crystals of cale. spar, which served to collect
any acid fumes from the sulphuric acid rocker, without introducing any gas other
than carbon dioxide.
