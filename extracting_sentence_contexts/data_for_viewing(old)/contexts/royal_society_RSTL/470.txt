Z mist desires us to boil the acid with the mercury, after they have ceased to act upon

It now remains to speak of the real hyperoxygenized muriate
of mercury. I passed a current of oxygenized muriatic acid
gas through some water, in which there was red oxide of mer-
cury.* After a short time, the oxide became of a very dark
