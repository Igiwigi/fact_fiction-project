The same truth comes out on examining the specimens with regard to the presence
or absence of young hymenia, the waxy yellow humps showing up distinctly on
several of the richer growths on sap-wood of oak especially ; whereas no traces of
incipient hymenia were visible on the poorer growths on the heart-wood.

That light is not necessary to the development of the fungus, or of the hymenia,
comes out clearly from the above. But, side by side with the series referred to, I had
prepared in July an exactly corresponding series, 7.¢., three tubes each of heart- and
sap-wood of oak, willow, 4sculus, and pine, infected at the same time and kept side
by side at 15°-18° C, in the light.

The same facts came out on examining the three months’ cultures in October. In
all cases the growth was luxuriant on the sap-wood, and in some cases had proceeded
so far that incipient hymenia were visible ; whereas on the heart-wood the mycelium
was much more feebly developed, and no hymenial beginnings were perceptible.

It is, perhaps, premature to speculate on the causes of these differences, since they
may reside in difference of food-materials in the walls of heart- and sap-wood respec-
tively, in the existence of antiseptic bodies, in differences of mechanical obstruction
to the entry of the hyphe, or in other factors; but taking all observations together,
I suspect that aération—ventilation—is at the bottom of the whole question, and I
am now carrying on experiments which will, I hope, settle the matter.

In this connection it may be interesting to compare the normal structure of the
