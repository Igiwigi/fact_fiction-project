Unfortunately, the way in which research is
presented in the media is not always unbiased, and research
can be manipulated or misinterpreted by persons or groups
that may have a pre-determined agenda. We emphasize the
challenges of such debate through the discussion of recent
case studies [17,18,99], some of which were highly publicized
within the UK media. Through these case studies, we high-
light how the scientific position can become skewed both
within scientific publications themselves, and in their
subsequent representation within the media.

(b) Representation of fire in scientific publications

The context set by Yallop et al. [99] is a relatively balanced dis-
cussion of benefits and costs of managed fire, except for the fact
that for some research areas they consider the evidence base to
support their assertions was rather limited. This was (and still
is) particularly true for the effects of fire on C sequestration. Yallop et al. [99] cite one paper where managed burning was
shown to reduce C sequestration in peat bogs [65].
