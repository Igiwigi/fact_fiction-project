It is an exceedingly interesting question to judge if the original erythrine of
Heeren $hould be looked upon as a determinate and independent substance, or
whether it should be considered as having been, under an impure form, any of the
substances which I have found. The accuracy and detail with which Hzeren ope-
rated upon the snbstances he describes, should certainly be considered as rendering
it highly improbable that he could have examined his erythrine in such a variety of
ways, without detecting it to be a mixture, if it really was 80; and more, he assigns
to erythrine two characters which certainly do not belong to either of the bodies
which I have now described ; 1st, that it is insoluble in ether ; and 2nd, that when
heated it is in part volatilized. On the other hand, if be had obtained the erythrine
in a pure condition, it is not likely that he would have sent his pseudo-erythrine to
Lien for analysis, without sending also the substance, which was the far more im-
portant of the two, his erythrine ; this point is strengthened also by the fact that he
found the active principle of the Lecanora Tartarea to be by no means identical with,
although strongly resembling erythrine. The conversion of his erythrine also into
psendo-erythrine by boiling with alcohol, indicates either the identity of erythry-
line with his erythrine, which can scarcely be supposed, or that his erythrine was
a mixture of true erythrine with some other snbstances more sparingly soluble in
alcohol and scarcely soluble in ether, which I consider to have been most probably
