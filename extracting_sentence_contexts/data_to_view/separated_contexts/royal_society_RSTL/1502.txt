Read December 1g, 1821. Tur discovery of a new species of any of the larger animals,
now that our globe has been so extensively explored, is an
object of interest to the naturalist, and might afford sufficient
reason for laying this new fact before the Society ; but this
interest will be much increased, when there is a striking re-
semblance between the form and appearance of the skull of
this animal, now in being, and the skull of one of the same
tribe, only met with in a fossil state. It has been hitherto asserted, as one of the most curious
circumstances in the history of the earth, that all the bones
that are found in a fossil state, differ from those belonging to
animals now in existence ; and I believe that this is generally
admitted, and that there is no fact upon record, by which it
has been absolutely contradicted ; but the observations I am
about to state respecting this rhinoceros, illustrated by the
drawings that accompany them, will go a great way to stagger
our belief upon this subject. The skull of the animal belonging to this new species of
rhinoceros, now living in Africa, was brought to this country
by Mr. CAMPBELL, one of the Missionaries sent there from
