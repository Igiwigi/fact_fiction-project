Without this capacity, we would
be unable to coordinate with in-group members or avoid out-group
members. Past research in social psychology and cognitive neuroscience
Accepted: 17 November 2020 examining social categorization has suggested that one way to identify
in-group members may be to directly compute the similarity between
oneself and the target (dyadic similarity). This model, however, does not
account for the fact that the group membership brought to bear is context-
political brain: neurocognitive and dependent. This review argues that a more comprehensive understanding
computational mechanismsâ€™. of how we build representations of social categories (and the subsequent
impact on our behaviours) must first expand our conceptualization of
social categorization beyond simple dyadic similarity. Furthermore, a gener-
alizable account of social categorization must also provide domain-general,

understanding political behaviour.
