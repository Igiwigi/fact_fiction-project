These effects are such as would be produced, at
S least partially, by polarisation of the electrodes, and that this is s0 can be shown in
& the u8nal way by leaving the electrodes only connected with the galvanometer, either
Z in direct, contact with one another, or with the body intervening. Current is indicated
Z in either case, greater of course in the former. We observe another fact indicating a
5 fallacy to which the estimation of after-effects is especially liable, viz.: that after a
'5 given duration of current, with a given deflection of the needle, a given interval is
2 followed by a greater deflection which rapidly subsides to the original deflectionâ€”a
2 phenomenon which may repeat itself several times in guccession, and obtains whether
RS the electrodes are kept in broken or in closed circuit during the interval. Without
S committing ourselves to any positive statement, we may remark that our observations
led us to suppose that during the passage of the galvanic current, an opposed electro-
S motive force is developed within the body which rapidly subsides.
