This must,
of course, be due, either to expansions and contractions of the plate, caused by the

may be 80 called) leaving the incandescent surface with a higher temperature and of
greater volume than they possessed when approaching it. The foregoing experiments obyiously admit of many variations, which it is un-
necessary to mention here,

A remarkable fact is that the vibrations seb up in « jeb by sound seem to be inde-
pendent of the direction of the sound, and copy: only its form, Tb is quite true that
powerful impulses, such as those produced by a vibrating tuning-fork held close to the
orifice, will cause the jet to divide or branch, and the direction of this branching will
depend on the position of the tuning fork. But, 80 tar as I have observed, 8mall
disturbances of the gas ab the orifice exert the same influence, from whatever direc-
tion they may arrive. Such disturbances may be other than of a mechanical nature.
