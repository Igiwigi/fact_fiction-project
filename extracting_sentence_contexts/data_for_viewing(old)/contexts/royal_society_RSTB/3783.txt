numerous, and we have, therefore, disposed of the difficulties presented by an assumed
conjugation of entire chromosomes ; in the present state of our knowledge speculation
as to the manner in which this union is effected must prove abortive, but we have
reasons for believing that chromosomes can be resolved into component granules of a
like diameter, and conjugation of such smaller units is the only explanation that
appears possible.

Moreover, if evolution is continuous and development accompanied by further
increase in chromosome lengths, a stage must occur when rods of the greater
diameter have reached limits imposed by physical conditions; a second increase in
thread-width then becomes necessary, and we must accordingly anticipate recur-
rence of such increase at regular periods as evolution proceeds. This supposition is
supported by actual facts, for reference to the animal kingdom shows that transition
to a double thread-width again occurs as we pass from Nemertinea to Nemathel-
minthia, and, since all phyla including and above the latter possess chromosomes of

this increased diameter, we must assume that rod-lengths have not yet reached the
stage that necessitates further doubling of the thread.

Now, if increased diameter is the result of conjugation of pre-existing bodies,
