Gran be described roughly as a nearly spherical ellipsoid of revolution, with one half
slightly flattened at the middle, and the other slightly tapered in the antipodal
direction. The figure was described as “ pear-shaped,” the “pear” having a blunt
end, a sharper end, and a waist. The waters of the ocean would presumably collect

in the hollow of the waist, and JEANS pointed out that there is some resemblance of
the shape of the Earth to this figure, although the “stalk” end of the “pear” was
difficult to discover.

In the same year a paper was published by W. J. Soruas,* in which it was

concluded from a discussion of the geographical facts that the shape of the Earth

resembles that of a “pear”; but Sotas’ and Jeans’ “ pears” have little in common
beyond the name. Juans’ ideal distribution would consist of a hemisphere which is
nearly all land, and an antipodal hemisphere which is nearly all ocean, with a central
island in the middle of this ocean. Soxtas’ account of the actual distribution is that
in one hemisphere there is a central continent (Africa) nearly surrounded by a belt of
