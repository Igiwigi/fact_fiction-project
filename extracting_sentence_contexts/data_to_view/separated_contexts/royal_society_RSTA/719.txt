The fact that there are such large changes in the
distribution of amplitude among the different stations suggests both that the foci of
individual earthquakes are regions of limited extent and that they are in many
instances close to the surface of the earth compared with the distance between stations,
i.e. within 1 or 2 km. of the surface. Otherwise, if the foci were all deep seated, we
should expect to find the amplitude for all stations nearly equal for all shocks. These
conclusions are strengthened by the fact that in estimating the position of the foci it
has been necessary in some instances to assume that the distribution in amplitude is
affected markedly by certain surface features (cf. ยง 9). In some volcanic regions, notably in Hawaii, earthquakes occur most frequently
when magma is falling in the volcanic crater.
