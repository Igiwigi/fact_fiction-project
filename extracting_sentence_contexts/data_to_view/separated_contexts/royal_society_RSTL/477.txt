be confounded together, the
separation of geometry‚Äù from algebra will thereby be equally
urged as the separation of algebra from geometry. And it can-
not be said with greater truth, that the simplicity of geometry
is vitiated with algebraic equations, than that the simplicity of
analysis is vitiated with geometrical forms and expressions. In
fact, each science ought to be kept distinct; and be made to
derive its riches from its proper sources. XXV. It will not demand much meditation to be assured of
this truth, that, in any mathematical investigation, the geome-
trical method, properly so called, is not essentially or absolutely
necessary.
