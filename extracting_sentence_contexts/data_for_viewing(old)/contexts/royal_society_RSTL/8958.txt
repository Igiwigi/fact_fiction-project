and a Cryptohelia, and the similar facts observed by Sas in the genus Allopora, strengthen
the facts brought forward by PourraLts, with regard to the coralla, in a very potent
manner. I hope to make a elose study of the structure of Stylaster. 'The apparent
absence of mesenteries is most remarkable, and a similar condition appears to occur
also in Millepora. The number of tentacles and septa in the Stylasteride seems hardly
to follow the usual hexameral law. In the species of Stylaster examined by me there
are invariably twenty-two septa and twenty-two tentacles. In Stylaster erubescens,
PovRTALEs describes the septa as being in number from nine to twelve, most frequently
eleven. In Allopora miniata the septa are from seyen to ten, generally eight. Cryp-
tohelia has commonly sixteen.

With regard to the affinities of the Milleporide, no certain conclusion can be arrived
at from the few facts yet ascertained. I hope to obtain specimens at Hawaii in sexually
mature condition}.

* PoveraLis has remarked that the genus Endohelia of M,-Epwanns and Hanm appears indistinguishable
from the genus Oryptohelia of the same authors. Fndohelia is founded on a Japanese 8species. The <Challenger*
dredged a coral certainly not generically distinguishable from Cryptohelia off the coast of Japan.
