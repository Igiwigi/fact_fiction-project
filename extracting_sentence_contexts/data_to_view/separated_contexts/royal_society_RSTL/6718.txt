1, 3,
4, 20, & 27, which are taken from fully formed or old cells, the different proportion of
* germinal matter” to the © formed material” at different ages will be observed ; and it is
to be noticed that the youngest cells (fig. 9) consist almost entirely of germinal matter,
while in the fully formed cell there is at least from ten to twenty times as much * formed
material” as there is of © germinal matter” (tig. 1). In the fully formed cell the germinal matter (nucleus) exhibits a line around it, but
there is no cell-wall or other structure between it and the granular material which
surrounds it. In fact, by the use of high powers, an actual continuity of structure
may usually be demonstrated, The smaller centres (nucleoli) also seem to be distinet
from the germinal matter in which they lie. Even in these s0-called * nucleoli ” still
smaller spherical bodies, to the number of three or four (nucleoluli), are sometimes to
be seen distinctly (figs. 26 & 27). These centres are evidently formed one within the
other.
