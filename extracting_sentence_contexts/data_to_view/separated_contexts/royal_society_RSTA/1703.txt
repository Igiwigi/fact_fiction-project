As Iy is an admissible feedback,
then t+> v(t,-) is the state of the closed loop-system associated with (Q, B,C). This means that
equation (4.12) is equivalent to

i(t,)=Q"v(t,), v0,)=9, #20,
where

Q1=Q14+BCa, DQ") = (ye D(Ca):(Q-1 + BCa) y € Ep},

which generates a strongly continuous semigroup on Ep. By using a similar proof as in [27,
Thm. 4.1], lemma 4.4, and the fact that e, are eigenvalues of Qm, one can see that the operator


Q" coincides with
Qke =Qme, D(Qk) = {¢ € D(Qm) : 9(0) = Kg}. The semigroup generated by Qx is given by: for any t > 0, g € Ey and t <0,

In the rest of this section, we deal with neutral equations with non-autonomous past. To this
end, we consider the equation

where A: D(A) C X > X generates a strongly continuous semigroup on X, f+ 2; in the history
function defined in definition 4.3, the operator K is given by (4.7), and L: W!?(R-,X) > X is the
operator defined by
