To complete this memoir, it only remains for me to show how the different pheno-
mena, produced by the passage of the electric current through the nerye, may be
arranged in groups founded upon the two principles quoted and deduced immediately
from experiment. In this manner I hope to redeem my pledge of giving a theory of
the physiological action of the electric current. It is only in this manner that the
advance of the physical sciences can be promoted, by deducing, that is to say, the
greatest number of facts possible from the smallest number of elementary facts. I
do not indeed pretend to affirm that the two principles upon which I take my stand,
and which are immediately deduced from experiment, are the simplest and most
elementary facts in s0 yast a field as that of the connection between the electric and
nervous phenomena; but it is certain that a great number of electro-physiological
facts, which existed without any mutual relation, are now brought under the de-
pendence of two fundamental facts. The manner in which a mixed nerye, subjected
to the passage of the electric current, presents different phenomena according to the
degree of its excitability, is this.
