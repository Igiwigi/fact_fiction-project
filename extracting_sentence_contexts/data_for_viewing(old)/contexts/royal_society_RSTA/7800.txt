we easily find that

E, (i) =

(2n + 1) = Fy,1 (kr) — F,. (kr),

and

(2n + 1) F’, (kr) = — [(n + 1) Fyus (kr) + Fy (Ar)]. « . . (4.62)

The following special cases of these formulae may be noticed ; they depend upon
the fact that K_, (z) = K, (z):

Pu) Se 7 re (4.63)

We see that the formulae for F, are of the same form as those for F,, except that
when n is zero, F,_, becomes F).

With the help of the above formulae for the F,’s and the P,”’s, we readily obtain
the following results :
