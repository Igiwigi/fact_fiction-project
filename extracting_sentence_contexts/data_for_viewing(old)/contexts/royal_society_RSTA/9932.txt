to build up the alkali series. Whether this has any real significance, however, must
be at present an open question.

Further Discussion.

From the foregoing discussion a few points stand out for further consideration.
The most important is the doubt as to the form for the 8 series.

The dissatisfaction with the form in a/m for the S series arises from the fact that
VS (1) does not give P (0), and that in some cases the value of S (2) calculated by it
from constants determined from § (3.4.5) is considerably outside the limits of obser-
vation, certainly in the case of K, and probably also for Rb and Cs. This second
failure, however, clearly is a consequence of the first, and will probably be corrected
if the first is. In addition, the ~—5 of the S is so close to the value of the atomic
volume term in P as to point to a real equality if the true form be obtained, whilst
the value of « in S is always considerably less than that in P. It has been shown
that the VS(1) cannot be made = P() without introducing a term in B/m’, and
that in the two numerical examples given for Na and K, the « and B come about
equal—in other words, a denominator = m+p—am~'(1+m7') would satisfy all the
conditions, Also the ~—‘d is brought nearer to the atomic volume term, but «
becomes about one-half that in the P series. Before considering this clue further,
