Early electronic-structure calculations from the 1980s by Chantal Daniel accordingly : S$
indicated the importance of accounting for spin barriers resulting from different multiplicities in the D8
electronically excited states of the complex [38]. In this respect the photodissociation of Fe(CO)s5 has always [3S
been a prototypical example for understanding how the reactivity in organometallic photoreactions and : &

the dynamics of charge and spin densities are correlated. In fact iron pentacarbonyl made its way into
modern text books such as into the one by Albright et al. entitled Orbital Interactions in Chemistry
[39]. Various time-resolved methods were then used to probe the short-lived intermediates involved in
the photochemistry of iron pentacarbonyl and the paper by Poliakoff and Turner from 2001 summarized
the widely accepted state-of-the-art [40]. One of the main and maybe one of the most obvious questions,
however, remained open, namely, how does the iron-carbonmonoxide bonding actually change in the course
of the photochemical reaction?
