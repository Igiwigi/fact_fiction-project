Thexe are the colours which dried skins exhibit, but they are not found in any species
of Prion when alive. Tt is, therefore, most probaþle that Latham's desecription was
taken from an actual skin, as in 1824 he reproduces it almost yerbatim in his

from the paintings and drawings made by Forster, Parkinson, and Ellis, for Sir J.
Banks, but, when he has done this, he generally states the fact in his latest work.
We may therefore conclude that the type of his © Brown-banded Petrel” existed
as a skin in Sir J. Banks' collection, probably as late as 1824, but it is nob now in
the British Museum. Ellis' drawing is unmistakeable, and was perhaps taken
from the actual type-specimen when in the flesh ; it was from access to this drawing
that the late Mr. Gray was enabled to make out that P. desolatus was a Prion, and
the collection of specimens by the recent expeditions has led to the re-discoyery of
an interesting species. On looking over the series of Prion skins in the Museum,
T have ſound a specimen from Chris:mas Harbour, Kerguelen Island, collected during
the Antarctic Expedition, and IT have carefully compared it with the other birds in
the Museum collection. It is of the species usually called by naturalists Prion
turtur, and is, T believe, the true P. turiur of Kuhl. At first T was inclined to
consider this a different species, as it has such a distinet yellow nail at the end of the
