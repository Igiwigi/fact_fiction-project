the former has therefore some increased interest and importance.

With regard to the body of the uterus, I have only here to record the fact that the

mucosa is somewhat thicker than it is in S. entellus, and that the protoplasmic
network of the stroma is more granular and is denser, and the glands more numerous
and more branched than are these structures in the latter animal.

In M. rhesus as in S. entellus, there is an absence of any connective tissue frame-
work in the stroma ; we have, in fact, here, an essentially primitive tissue capable of
extensive and rapid growth, and of transformation into other and more specialised
tissues. The uterine and glandular epithelium, the glands devoid of a definite sheath,
and the arrangement of the musculature, are all the same as are seen in S. entellus.

A. Period of Rest. Stage I—The nuclei of the stroma at this stage are more
densely packed in the lower portion of the mucosa than they are in the superficial
part; in the latter situation a loose tissue exists, held together by a network of
delicate protoplasmic processes.

I have observed no fibrils in the stroma of M. rhesus. A

B. Period of Growth. Stage 1—Vhere is a great increase in the number of the
