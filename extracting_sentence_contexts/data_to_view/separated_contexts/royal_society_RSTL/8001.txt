The & stern” of this barge-shaped skull keeps its ** deck” now to the end; it becomes
extremely wide, having the ear-capsules impacted in its sides. In the sectional view
(Plate VIL. fig. 10) the thin cartilaginous roof, cut through where the supraoccipital region
passes into the © pterotic,” is seen to pass directly into the ear-capsule, close above the
arch of the posterior canal (p.s.c.). The apparent want of continuity in the rest of the
section arises from the fact that it has been made through the © fenestra ovalis” (f5.0.)
and the * meatus internus” (7%). The basitemporal wings of the parasphenoid (pa.s.)
underlie most of the width of the broad basicranial floor in which the notochord (7.0.)
lies imbedded; it is here free above, and, below, lies on a cartilaginous commissure. Part of the stapedial plate (ﬆ.) has been left to this section, which also shows the
posterior half of the horizontal canal (þ.s.c.), the yestibule (v.0.), and the huge © medulla
oblongata (m.06):” large as this is, it does not fill the cranial cavity.
