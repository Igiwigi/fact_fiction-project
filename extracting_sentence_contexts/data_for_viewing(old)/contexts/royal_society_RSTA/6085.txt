pattern that started on the palm, crossed the volar side of the index finger and ended on the
fingertip of the index finger. The plot indicates that the six sensors responded to the shear tests
and that the sliding direction could be easily inferred from the sequence of sensor activations.
Interestingly, the sensor response pattern is in this case more complex; the press and release peaks
are still visible, but they are not as sharp as in figure 5a,b. This reflects a different sensor response
to the different type of mechanical interaction (shear forces). The sliding movement provoked
more gradual activation and deactivation of the sensors compared to previous indentation tests.
A number of interesting patterns are shown in figure 5d. They can actually reveal how shear
information on the surface of the skin is translated into normal stress that is measured by
the piezoelectric polymer sensors working in thickness mode. While in such a configuration
PVDF polymer sensors only measure the normal T33 stress component [77], we have previously
proven [78] that shear information on the skin surface can also be detected by the sensors. As
a matter of fact, shear forces tend to unbalance the normal stress distribution on the substrate
(where sensors are integrated) by producing a kind of wake in the direction of their resultant.
Ahead of the wake, the compression is increased while at the rear a tensile region appears.
However, this previous study has been made for static contacts, not dynamic ones. The current
protective layer will also ultimately affect stress transmission to the piezoelectric polymer sensors.
Pursuing the goal of thoroughly coding these patterns is not a minor undertaking and requires
a new experimental study with a well-controlled setup. This will be the topic of a forthcoming
publication.
