minimum shows several water molecules in the third shell whereas this is absent for the cluster
from [65].


The high coordination of Ca?+ for most of the clusters with n > 8 (exceptions in the studied
range are only n=9 and 10, with seven water molecules coordinated) is a consequence of the
strong ion-solvent interaction, which is highly competitive with the formation of the hydrogen
bond network (especially for n > 15, at which molecules begin to arise in the third solvation shell);
there is, however, some disparity among different experimental and theoretical estimates for the
coordination number of these clusters (e.g. [75] and references therein), and this certainly deserves
further investigation. Even though the cation prefers to stay inside the cluster (in agreement with
MD simulations [27]), thus working as a structure-breaking species, the formation of clathrates
with the lowest energy are not observed up to n = 27. In fact, it was shown [65] that the formation
of a clathrate for Ca2+ -(H2O) 9 is unfavourable, because the water-ion energy contribution rather
stabilizes the GM.

Concerning the solvation of Cat by methanol, we have studied clusters only for n < 10,

because the global optimization is more computationally demanding due to the large : =
dimensionality of the system (which complicates the calculation of the potential function), as well : a
as the great number of local minima in a small energy window. The results show (see electronic 73
supplementary material, figure S3) that, up to n=6, the GM clusters grow by the addition of aes
one methanol molecule to the first solvation shell. For 1 =7, the coordination number retains a : _
value of six (as for n = 6), while one methanol molecule goes to the second solvation shell and : 4
establishes two hydrogen bonds. The 1 = 8 cluster has seven molecules in the first solvation shell : S
