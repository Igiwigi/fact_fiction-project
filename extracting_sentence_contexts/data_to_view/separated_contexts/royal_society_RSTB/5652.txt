It can hardly be seen with the naked eye and the statement therefore
that a double talonid cusp is a generic character of Hyracotherium is not correct. As
for the rest of the tooth it is only necessary to state that the anterior crest of the hypo-
conid runs down to a point midway between the protoconid and mesoconid as in TEIL-
HARDâ€™S figure of Propachynolophus, which the present specimen resembles more than it
does his figure of Hyracotherium. A comparison of the two lower molars in fact helps
to show that there is very little, if any, difference between these two genera. The
molars of H. cuniculus which are described later are a little different. Hyracotherium vulpiceps. (Figs. 4, 5, Plate 51.)
