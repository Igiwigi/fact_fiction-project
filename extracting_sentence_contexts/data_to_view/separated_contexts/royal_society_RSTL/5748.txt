yhich shows that a matrix compounded with the transposed matrix gives rise to a 8ym-

1etrical matrix. It does not however follow, nor is it the fact, that the matrix and

transposed matrix are convertible. And also

(acY ab Y ac )=( f+bd+A +), O+abd+(&+@) ) [s, a||c,q I 6b, d| | Pracd+(&+@), P+abe+d(P+6) |

which is a remarkably symmetrical.
