approximation relies on the fact that the UCM velocity profiles are in good agreement with the
velocity profiles experimentally observed at small forcing amplitudes, except at resonances [27].
Following this reasoning, we have found that above a critical value of the forcing amplitude
normal radial stresses diverge in a finite time, and so do all other stress components. Normal

radial stresses are perpendicular to the flow direction and can bend the streamlines, giving rise : =
to the secondary flow observed experimentally [21]. Repeating this scheme systematically, in the : a
whole range of forcing frequencies experimentally accessible, we have found remarkably good 73
agreement with the threshold determined experimentally, as shown in figure 4, with no adjustable iL
parameters other than material properties and system dimensions. =

Since the present scheme relies on maximum shear stresses 1,z in the UCM base flow, it is not [4

shear rate exhibits a maximum (at shear rates near the inverse of the fluid relaxation time) and 18
