A branch-system of this type from the Perry
Basin, Maine, which was described by Wurre (Smita and Wurre, 1905) under the
name Psilophyton alcicorne, was referred to the Upper Devonian. Srwarp (1931,
p. 124) suggested that it probably came from a lower horizon and that it might
well have been a piece of Zosterophyllum. The fact that the branched axes under
consideration here were found associated with fertile spikes of Z. australianum makes
it almost certain that they were the vegetative portion of that plant. The evidence obtained as to the occurrence in this flora of fairly large stems
that bore simple leaves which must have been of considerable size, is of interest in
several respects. The specimens are most naturally compared with Baragwanathia
from the Monograptus Beds.
