That fluid is permeable to radiating heat as well as the atmosphere. The
application of the thermometer, in the hands of Dr. WeLLs, instructed us regarding
the cooling of the surface of the ground; but the water of a river, placed under the
very game condition of a clear sky, fluid above and freezing below, is a great natural
thermometer, teaching us that a corresponding cooling is going on on the surface of
the solid opake substances of the bottom. In fact, if we may $0 speak, the pheno-
menon of the ground-gru is the result of an experiment in the water, entirely similar
to that of Dr. WerLs on the land, performed by nature on a large scale, and pre-
sented to us for our interpretation and instruction. And when we look back to the
observations made in the month of January, we find the results of the modifications
of this great natural experiment corresponding with those of similar modifications of
the experiment on the dry land. The cooling of the surface of the ground by radiation, discovered by Dr. Werrs,
takes place only under a clear sky.
