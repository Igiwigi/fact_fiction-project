In higher worms the
development of fibres is almost constantly perfect in all parts of the body. KEFERSTEIN

and other obseryers have called the external tisxwe of the Planarians they have
examined a basement, membrane, and have therefore described longitudinal muscles as
being external in that animal—which no doubt is correct from one point of view, since
it is probably impossible to detect any muscular fibres in the external tissue of the
body; but still it is apt to lead to an erroneous conclusion. The great fact to be borne
in mind is that, whatever this external tunic may be called, it is the homologue of the
external circular muscular coat, of higher worms and Bipalium, and that therefore the
distinction between the arrangements of the muscular system in the two groups is of
very little importance. M-IxTosn (oc. cit. p. 310) lays great stress on the fact that in
Ommatoplea alba the circular muscles are external and the longitudinal internal, whilst
in Borlasia the reverse is the case; and accordingly he regards these two worms as
belonging to very different types indeed. Now it would be difficult to overestimate the
wide gulf which would exist between these two forms if there were really any inversion
of the muscular coats here; but the external circular coat of Ommatoplea is evidently
the homologue of the thick external tunic of Borlasia, called by M*IvTosn the base-
ment membrane, since in Ommatoplea there is said to be no basement membrane, and
the external circular muscular coat lies immediately beneath the epidermis, as does the
80-called basement membrane of Borlasia.
