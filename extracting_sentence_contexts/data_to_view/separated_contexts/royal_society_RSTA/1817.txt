At the input of
the fibre the pulse is tens of nanometres in bandwidth but after a very short time of propagation
this increases to many hundreds of nanometres and begins to overlap with the wavelength of the
resonant radiation. This mode overlap or coupling between the pulse and the resonant radiation
gives a huge boost to the efficiency, and this method has been used to demonstrate large energy
conversion efficiencies of up to 40% from an infrared pulse to the visible [29-31]. This is only
possible in the resonant radiation case due to the fact that the pulse self-stimulates the resonant
conversion, and this same trick can not help us boost the conversion efficiency from the external
probe in the Hawking process case.

(c) Efficiency

The pulse compression effect depends finely on the input parameters of the pulse, particularly the
power, the wavelength and the chirp. In our laboratory we made an experiment to see just how
efficient this process could become. We sent short 50 fs pulses through dispersion compensation
and power control into a photonic crystal fibre (NLPM760, NKT Photonics) with zero-dispersion
wavelength 760nm, nonlinear coefficient 0.1W~! m=! and core size 1.6 1m.
