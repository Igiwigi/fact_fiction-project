of objects capable of acting upon the mind, and particularly
by removing all straight lines and angles, and all unnecessary
varieties of lights and shades, the attention might be concen-
trated and fixed in such a manner as 'to render the sense of
Sight peculiarly acute in distinguishing any difference in the
simple objects presented to the eye. But however plausible
this reasoning may appear, I own the experiment did not an-
swer my expectation. It is true, the apparent densities of two
equal hemispheres of shade, in contact with each other, may
be compared with great facility, and when no discernible dif-
ference is to be perceived between them, it is more than pro-
bable that they are in fact very nearly equal; but still I have
found by experience, that two equal parallelograms of shade in
contact with each other may be compared with the same ease,
and, I have reason to think, with equal certainty, and that
even when these unite! shadows are bounded on three sides by
a perfectly white surface, illuminated by the direct rays of two
strong lights ; that is to say, when the screen with the qua-
drangular opening or field is made use of. In describing the cylinders by which the shadows are pro-
jected, I said they were fixed in the bottom of the box; but as
the diameters of the shadows of the cylinders vary in some
small degree, in proportion as the lights are broader or nar-
rower, and as they are brought nearer to or removed farther
from the photometer, in order to be able in all cases to bring
these shadows to be of the same diameter, which I have found
by experience to be adyantageous, in order to judge with greater
facility and certainty when the shadows are of the same density,
I have rendered the cylinders moveable about their axes, and
have added to each a vertical wing Â£5 of an inch wide, 77; of

an inch thick, and of equal height with the cylinder itself,
and firmly fixed to it from the top to the bottom. This wing
commonly lies in the middle of the shadow of the cylinder,
and as long as it remains in that situation it has no effect
whatever ; but when it is necessary that the diameter of one
of the shadows be increased, the corresponding cylinder is
moved about its axis, till the wing just described emerging out
da of the shadow, and intercepting a portion of light, brings the
a shadow projected upon the field of the instrument to be of the
E width or diameter required.
