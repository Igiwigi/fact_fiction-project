The bands at 690 and 620cm~!
we have noted hitherto in degraded human skin, where they have been assigned to CS stretching
modes from degraded CSSC cross-linked protein strands occurring at cysteine residues, where the
formation of cysteic acid had occurred through biological degradation. The presence of a weak
feature at 1729cm7! is indicative confirmation of a carboxylic acid which could possibly arise
from this source.

Although the specific band assignments are necessarily rather tentative in what must be : 8
viewed as a complex specimen, it is nevertheless reasonable to propose that the Raman 8
spectroscopic data support the assertion that the specimen is in fact human brain, although this : Ss
has been degraded somewhat in the burial environment. The surprising outcome of this study is : S

that the brain has survived at all over some 160 years; there is now a growing body of support
in the literature from archaeological excavations for the survival of brain tissue with associated
skeletal remains, particularly in wet, anoxic environments such as that noted here. In the case of
the Iron Age brain from Heslington, the presence of cyanobacterial biosignatures were evident
in the Raman spectrum both of the brain itself and in the black sludge occupying the cavity
between the brain and the cranium [30].
