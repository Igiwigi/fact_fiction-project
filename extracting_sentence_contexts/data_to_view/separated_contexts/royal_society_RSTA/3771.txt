In atomic force microscopy, [3
the object of interest is chemically or physically bound to a substrate [4,5]. In convex lens-induced : =
confinement (CLIC), the object is confined vertically in a thin chamber [6]. 8
Feedback traps have been applied to the study of single molecules [7-14] and to explore eri
fundamental questions in the non-equilibrium statistical mechanics of small systems [8,15-23]. : a
For the latter applications, we have developed an improved anti-Brownian electrokinetic trap : S
(ABEL) trap that can create virtual potentials for the particle of interest. Reflecting this more general : s

application and the fact that the trapping forces need not be electrokinetic—any available force
will do—we adopt the more generic name of feedback trap. The feedback trap periodically measures the position of an object and then calculates and
applies a force to keep the particle in the field of view. The action of the feedback loop creates
a virtual potential that can confine a particle or force it to perform more complicated motion.
