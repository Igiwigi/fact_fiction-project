hour if the modulus of decay is as long as 20 years.

The most crucial test to which we can subject the theory of ocean currents here
put forward will consist in the evaluation of the moduli of decay for the types ot
motion concerned. â€˜This I have endeavoured to do, but as the work involves
analytical considerations of a somewhat different character from those which occur
in the present work, I have deemed it advisable to present the results in a separate
paper.* These results, so far as they are applicable, seem to point to a modulus of
decay far in excess of the 20 years here required, but the mathematical difficulties
have compelled me, in dealing with friction, to leave the rotation entirely out of
account. It appears that in the simpler system so treated, the types of free current
motion are far more arbitrary in character than those at which we have arrived by
including the rotation, This arises from the fact that our rotating system will be
capable of a large number of free oscillatory motions besides those which we have
examined in which the periods of oscillation always bear a finite ratio to the period
of rotation. As the period of rotation is lengthened, the period of each of these
types of oscillation is prolonged, and the possible forms of steady motion where
there is no rotation must include the limiting forms of each of these types of
oscillatory motion.

The moduli of decay of the free current motions when there is rotation may
therefore be very different in value from those obtained in the paper referred to, but
it does not seem to me that they could be much less in order of magnitude than the
moduli of decay of the principal types of free oscillation. If this prove to be the case,
the estimate of 20 years, which we have taken for the modulus of decay, will not be
