If it be power-
fully attracted by the magnet, it is good for the purpose ; if not, it should be
rejected. Having made two lifters, one of them of the best iron I could pro-
cure and the other of the worst, I found that a horse-shoe magnet with the
first would carry only fourteen pounds ; with the second it carried no less
than twenty-seven pounds. These facts will enable us to obtain the most powerful electric state by the
induction of magnets. A lifter made of the iron T have described will give a
much larger spark than one made of good iron. Another cireumstance to be
attended to in obtaining a large spark, is to use a $hort lifter, with a magnet
having its poles near one another.
