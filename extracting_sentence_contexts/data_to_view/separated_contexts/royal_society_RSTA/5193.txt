Tt is noticeable that the area of the curve increases at first and finally decreases as
the frequency is increased. In other words, with a given maximum of magnetizing
current the work expended in reversals is a maximum, per cycle, for some one
frequency. This, of course, results from the fact that at higher frequencies the
magnetization fails to penetrate sufficiently into the interior of the bar. In steel these phenomena are much less apparent than in soft iron, but they take
Place to some extent. Fig.
