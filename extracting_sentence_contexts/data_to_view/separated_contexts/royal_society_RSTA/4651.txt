As we have already mentioned, very small amounts of copper produce the Raouur
effect in lead, lowering the freezing point of this metal by the normal amount
corresponding to a monatomic molecule of copper (loc. cit.). On the flat at the
lower part of the figure a eutectic point at 60 atoms will be seen. The fact that alloys of lead and copper liquate has long been known, and the
general character of the freezing-point curve of such a system could have been
predicted from the work of ALEXEJEFF and Konovatorr, but, so far as we are
aware, this is the first case that has been traced experimentally. The bismuth-copper curve has not been carried beyond 9 atoms of bismuth, but,
from an inspection of the solid alloy, we think that it will turn out to be like the
lead-copper curve. The Copper-Tin Curve.
