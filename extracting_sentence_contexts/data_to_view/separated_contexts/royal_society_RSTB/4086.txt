CLAPAREDE and LACHMANN in 1858 established the fact that Lieberkuehnia Wageneri was affected by
a transition from darkness into light (C. and L. 1858, E.I.R., p. 465). * At the same time I do not lose sight of the possibility that, the spot of light having attracted swarms
of monads (as it always does), perhaps the Gromia crawled into the circle in pursuit of them. * Regard being had to the insistence in this paper upon the highly functional “behaviour” of
Foraminiferal protoplasm, it is perhaps desirable at once to point to the fact that no suggestion of any
specialised sensory constituent is here put forward. In unicellular organisms there is little room for
doubt that all parts of the protoplasm are sensitive to stimuli, without development of any sensory
constituent. (Cf. D. 1912, E.B., p. 188.)
