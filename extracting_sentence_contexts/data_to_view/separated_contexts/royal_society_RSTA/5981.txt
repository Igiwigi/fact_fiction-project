Therefore, we can obtain again the existence of a

semigroup of contractions, and the existence and uniqueness of solutions is guaranteed whenever 3
the initial data belongs to the domain of the operator. 1S

It seems difficult to obtain estimates for the decay of the solutions. However, we can guarantee : gS
that the point spectrum is on the left-hand side of the imaginary axis whenever b + nn? #0 for 12

every 1 €N. This fact suggests the decay of the solutions. However, a careful proof would need a
further study. If we follow an argument similar to the previous sections, we find that

My =Jp, Mz =Jp?E, Mg = Jo (kon! + bn? + €), My =J03E 1b + nn?
