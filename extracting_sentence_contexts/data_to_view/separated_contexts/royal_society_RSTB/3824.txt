We shall have to discuss in some detail,
at a later stage, the relationships of these two districts. As we shall see from the historical sketch, which forms the next section of this
paper, the geology of the Wyre Forest is very complicated, and at present very
little understood. This is largely due to the fact that the Forest, regarded from
a coal-winning standpoint, is only a minor coalfield, and consequently but little
attention has been devoted to the elucidation of its structure. It has not been
my intention to investigate this area from a purely geological point of view,
nor indeed has the time necessary for such a gigantic task, if undertaken single-
handed, been at my disposal. My object has, however, been to ascertain what light
the study of the fossil floras of the productive measures of the Wyre Forest throws
on its geology, and especially on the question of its relationship to the Midland and
Pennine coalfields.
