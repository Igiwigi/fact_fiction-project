relatively favourable position in the struggle. With reference to this point, observations
made on the plots have shown that occasionally when Dactylis has suffered from early
frost, then the other grasses have come to the front. The usually great prevalence of
Dactylis on plot 13 seems, therefore, to be reasonably attributable, at any rate in 80me
degree, to protection in the early stages of its growth. Assuming this to be 80, and

that the result was the establichment of a Å¿ew freer-growing, and the retardation of
more meagrely-developing species, we have obviously, in the fact of the predominance
of plants of greater feeding and growing capacities, conditions 8uited to the gathering
up of more food, even with the same supplies ; whilst, this being the case, the compara-
tively small increased 8upply would not be without its influence. In other words, the
increased produce on the plot, and the increased accumulation of nitrogen, silica, and
mineral constituents generally, is nob to be referred exclusively to the increased gupply
of constituents from without, but largely to the special conditions favouring the develop-
ment of species having a greater power of food collection, and therefore a greater power

of growth.
