And if, in addition to these, we
may be allowed to regard the more recent limestone and chalk
Strata as having been principally or partly formed from the
detritus of animal exuvie, we shall possess a complete series
of gradations, commencing with animal substances analogous in
properties to those which are recent, and terminating in bodies
decidedly mineral, in which all vestiges of organization have
been completely destroyed. The vegetable kingdom has likewise produced many instances
not less remarkable; and it is worthy of notice, that animal
petrifactions are commonly of a calcareous nature, while, on the
contrary, the vegetable petrifactions are generally siliceous ;*

It is not, however, my intention here to enter into a minute
discussion concerning the formation of these extraneous fossils ;
T hall therefore proceed to consider other equally or perhaps
more important changes, which organized bodies, especially
vegetables, appear to have suffered, (after the extinction of the
principle of life,) by being long buried in earthy strata, and by
being thus exposed to the effects of mineral agents.

* Pyrites, ochraceous iron orc, and fablertz, are also occasionally found in the forms
of vegetable bodies.


of some of the Principles of Vegetables into Bitumen, &c. 987

$ Il,

The principal object I have in view, is to adduce some addi-
tional proofs, that the bituminous substances are derived from
the organized kingdoms of nature, and especially from vegetable
bodies; for, although many circumstances seem to lead to the
opinion, that the animal kingdom has in some measure contri-
buted to the partial formation of bitumen, yet the proofs are by
no means 80 numerous, nor $0 positive, as those which indicate
the vegetable kingdom to have been the grand source from
which the bitumens have been derived. But this opinion,
(founded upon very strong presumptive evidence,) although
generally adopted, is however questioned by some persons ; and
I shall therefore bring forward a few additional facts, which
will, I flatter myself, contribute to demonstrate, that bitumen
has been, and is actually and immediately formed, from the
resin, and perhaps from some of the other juices of vegetables,

The chemical characters of the pure or unmixed bitumens,
Such as naptha, petroleum, mineral tar, and asphaltum, are, in
certain respects, s0 different from those of the resins and other
inspissated juices of recent vegetables, that, had the former never
occurred but in a separate and unmixed tate, no positive in-
ference could have been drawn from their properties, in proof of
their vegetable origin. Fortunately, however, they have been
'more frequently found under circumstances which have strongly
indicated the source from whence they have been derived; and
much information has been acquired {rom observations made

on the varieties of turf, bituminous wood, and pit coal, on the
-nature of their surrounding strata, on the vestiges of animal
and vegetable bodies which accompany them, and on various
other local facts; all of which tend considerably to elucidate the
history of their formation, and to throw light upon this interest-
ing part of geology.
