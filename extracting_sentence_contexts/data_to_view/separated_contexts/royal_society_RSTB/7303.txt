Moreover, just as Van Fleet (1948) has shown that apparently similar
parenchymatous cells of the cortex may have very different physiological reactions, so, too,
it may be assumed, as a working hypothesis, that the equidimensional meristematic cells
in different regions of the tunica are not identical in their physiological properties. In this
view the superficial cells at the summit of the dicotyledonous shoot would be regarded as
having distinctive properties, as in the ferns. To this may be added the fact that some

investigators have rejected the tunica-corpus theory as not affording an adequate account
of particular apices (Reeve 1948). It may, indeed, be said that until the tunica-corpus
concept has been elaborated and explored by the methods of physiology and experimental
morphology, it must be regarded as being still somewhat formal in character. The distinctive arrangement of cells in the apical meristem and adjacent regions is
determined by the genetical, physiological and physical factors which are at work there,
due attention being also paid to the changing geometrical relationships in any enlarging
