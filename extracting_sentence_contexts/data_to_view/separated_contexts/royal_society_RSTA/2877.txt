Their ML system was trained to ‘predict’
case law of the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), based on a selection of relevant
judgments. The researchers restricted the training data to published judgments, the assumption
being ‘that text extracted from published judgments bears a sufficient number of similarities
with, and can, therefore, stand as a (crude) proxy for, applications lodged with the Court, as

well as for briefs submitted by parties in pending cases’ ([25]: 2/19). This is an example of
opting for ‘low hanging fruit’ (easy to obtain training data), which raises some issues, as it
implies that the system draws its conclusions based on the Court’s articulation of the facts
of the case. As the authors note, the Court probably formulates the facts in a way that is
conducive to fit the conclusion ([25]: 5/19). This entails that no conclusions can be drawn about
correlations between the facts of the case and the outcome, and although the authors seem to
be aware of this, they nevertheless do conclude that the facts of the case have high predictive
value.
