inversely as the diameter. I have obtained them easily from a body one-quarter or
one-third of an inch in diameter, but they must be received at a considerable distance
from the body. Thirdly, and this is very material as to interference at all affecting
iy experiments, although certainly the internal fringes vanish when the rays are
stopped coming from the opposite side of the object, the external fringes are not in
the smallest degree affected, unless you stop the light coming on their own side;
stopping the opposite rays has no effect whatever. Thus, stopping the light on the
side @ (fig. 19), the fringes ff vanish, but not the external fringes c. This at once
proves there is no interference in forming the external ones. Lastly. I may observe,
that the law of disposition and polarization in some sort, though with modification,
affects the internal fringes as well as the external.

It is a curious fact connected with polarization by inflexion, and which indeed is
only to be accounted for by that affection of light, that nothing else prevents the rays
from circulating round bodies exposed to them, at least bodies of moderate diameter.
If the snccessive particles of the surface inflected, one particle acting after the other,
the rays must necessarily come round to the very point of the first flexion. We
$hould thus see a candle placed at A (fig. 22) when the eye was placed at B, because
the rays would be inflected all round; and even in parts of the earth where the sea
: is 8mooth, nothing but the small curvature of the surface could prevent us from
seeing the sun many hours after light had begun by placing the eye close to the
ground. 'This, however, in bodies of a small diameter, must inevitably happen. The
polarization of the rays alone prevents it, by making it impossi√æble they should be
more than once inflected on their side which was next the bending body, therefore
they go on straight to C. But for polarity they must move round the body.
