MR. J, H. JEANS ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF MOLECULAR ENERGY, 407

These equations are not independent ; when they are added together the resulting
equation vanishes identically in virtue of the fact that the mean total energy is,
under all circumstances, unchanged by collisions. Hence the equations can all be satisfied when the variables E,, E,... K are ina
definite ratio.
