The attribution of the spores is purely a matter of conjecture. Being of three sizes
they may either belong to different species or, possibly, they may be heterospores,
a feature not so far observed in the Zygopterides ; they may even be ‘‘ homospores ”
of variable size.* ‘There is no proof that any of the spores belong to the Clepsydropsis,
although the frequent occurrence of one kind in masses may indicate that they do ;
moreover, it would be easier for such relatively heavy spores to fall on to the stem-apex

* Considerable variation in the size of spores has been observed in other vascular plants in which true
heterospory has not been proved. Prof. Bower (1923, p. 264) records it in Notholena affinis) and J, M‘L,
Tompson (1917, p. 161, figs. 12-14) figures in Platyzoma microphyllum spores of three different sizes. As

Prof. Bower (loc. cit.) states, “ These facts suggest initial heterospory, but they have not yet been tested by
cultivation of the prothalli.”

from leaves held above it, than for them to be blown over to that height from a
different plant, unless the latter was also a tree-fern. On the other hand, we have to
keep in view the possibility that some of the spores may belong to a vascular cryptogam
growing as an epiphyte upon the Clepsydropsis, a view suggested by certain facts
presently to be described.
