Faravay, I conceive, would be; we cannot
at present, whatever we may do hereafter, make the electricity employed in effecting
this combination evident to any of our tests ; but I consider its presence as a necessary
inference, because I have adduced facts which prove, either that electricity is the
agent in such combinations, or that nature here deviates from the simplicity observed
in all her other works. Either electricity is the agent in the combination in question,
or there are two kinds of chemical affinity. Under such circumstances can any other reply avail except either disproving the
facts or pointing out the fallacy of the inference ? What I have done is strikingly illustrated by the late investigations of Dr. Farapay.
