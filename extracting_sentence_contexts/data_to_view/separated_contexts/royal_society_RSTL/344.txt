He

was put into a warm bed, and his heat, when examined under
MDCCXC11. Ee


the tongue, was 877, at the axilla 89*. Frictions were used,
and brandy mixed with water administered ; but I found on
this, as on all future occasions, that the best mode of counter-
acting the cold, was to apply a bladder, with hot water, to the.
pit of the stomach (the scrobiculus cordis), a fact which I
think important : this being done, his shiverings, which be-
fore were severe, s00n ceased, and he became more comfort=-
able. Three hours afterwards, however, he had not entirely
recovered his former heat ; but by eight at night, he was in
all respects as usual. I have been very minute in detailing the circumstances un-
der which this experiment was made ; some of the particulars
which, at the time, I thought of little consequence, I found
afterwards of importance.
