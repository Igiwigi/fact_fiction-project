and xiv., by Professor GRANT, that a correct
notion was entertained by naturalists of the inhalant and exhalant powers of those bodies. These details by the learned Professor are 80 full and complete as to leave but little
room for the improvement of our knowledge of this portion of their natural history. And the facts of the imbibition of the surrounding water by the pores in the dermal
membrane, its circulation through the internal cavities of the sponge, and its final ejection
through the oscula, have been firmly established and acknowledged by all naturalists
who have studied these animals closely in a living state. Dr. GRANT has, in truth, proved
himself to have been, in regard to the aqueous circulation in the sponge, what Harvey
was to that of the blood of the higher classes of animal life, the first to discover and to
publish the true mode of the circulation of the water in the animal. This learned and accurate observer says, * I first placed a thin layer from the surface
of the S. papillaris in a watch-glass with sea-water under the microscope, and on looking
at its pores I perceived the floating particles driven with impetnosity through these
openings; they floated with a gentle motion to the margin of the pores, rushed through
with a greatly increased velocity, often striking on the gelatinous networks, and again
relented their course when they had passed through the openings.
