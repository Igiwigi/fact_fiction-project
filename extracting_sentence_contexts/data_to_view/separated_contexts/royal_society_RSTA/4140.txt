when the depth of the
keyway is as great as ‘6 (semi-major axis), falls only about 1 per cent. when this depth
is 12 (semi-major axis). Possibly this may throw some light on the fact that the effect of cutting such slits
into the material does not always give in practice the reduction in the torsional
rigidity which should have been expected from Saint-VENANT's results for the circle. Clearly the depth of the keyway is a factor of the very first importance, and keyways
of moderate depth will produce a comparatively small effect on the torsional rigidity. It is also shown that the effect of cutting two equal and opposite slits is practically
equal, in the two cases which I have calculated (namely, «= 7/6 and «= 7/2), to twice
the effect of a single slit.
