development exhibited by it in every lineage; the peculiarities of each lineage will
then be seen to be grafted on to this general scheme. Before doing this, it is helpful
to ask what is the evolutionary aim unifying all the modifications of structure. And
if it is objected that this consideration is too theoretical, it may be answered that the
facts are confined to the diagnoses and descriptions of the specimens and to the records
of the localities and horizons at which they occur; and, therefore, to describe each
form and give it a trivial name is as far as we can go without theory; but to give a
form even a specific name is to assume theoretical relationships (since this involves
referring a species to a genus), and therefore to accept a doctrine of evolution by
descent. We are, therefore, driven to the use of theory in order to present our facts
in an intelligible order. When we talk, then, of seeking the evolutionary aim of a
group, we are only attempting by further theory to make our facts more intelligible.
Now, generally speaking, in the Cretaceous Cheilostomes, the facts are as follows.
The skeletal (presumably originally caleareous) parts of the organisms with which
we are dealing can be arranged in numerous lines (lineages) diverging from com-
paratively fewer forms. These radical forms are simpler, that is, there is less skeletal
matter and less elaboration of structure, and they are connected, more or less
gradually, by intermediate stages along the lineages with the ultimate forms that
have more skeletal matter and more elaboration of structure. On the whole, this
