If we formally put Cy = 0,
expressions (2.19) transform to the corresponding solutions for one-component systems [12]. Note
that the growth rate V(t) of crystals in binary melts is less than the rate of their growth in single-
component systems (m > 0, k < 1). An important feature of expressions (2.19) is the fact that they
do not depend on the radius R, of the equivalent sphere. Considering the intermediate stage of
crystal growth in a metastable liquid when all particles do not interact with their neighbouring
crystals, we note that T(1,0) and C(1,0) correspond to the mean temperature T) and concentration
C; of a metastable binary system.
