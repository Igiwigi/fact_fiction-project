Note'on Construction of Model 9 80. 6 ese, 881

The anatomy. of the Palsozoic Ophiuroidea has been far from exhaustively studied,
though they possess features of great interest. The nature of the available
material and the impossibility of obtaining conclusive evidence by the older methods
of study are sufficient reasons for our imperfect knowledge of these primitive
organisms.

In the following paper an account is given of the structure of the Silurian
Ophiurid Lapworthura miltoni (Salter), based upon a study of the fine series of this
fossil in the Oxford Museum and of models made by the method described by one of
us in 1901 (23), 1903 (24); other Paleeozoic Ophiuroidea are described and compared
with Lapworthura, and the bearing of the facts upon the interpretation of the
structure of modern types is considered.

It will be seen that in all essential points Lapworthura conforms to the type of
structure discovered by JAnKeEL in Eophiura, Paleura, and Bohemura (11), though it
has reached a more advanced stage of evolution. And indeed there is evidence to
show that all the Silurian and Devonian Ophiurids possess a fundamentally similar
structure. It is not possible to give exact detailed descriptions of all the named
genera, but it is not difficult, in the light of the knowledge gained from the study of
Lapworthura, to recognise in them a natural group differing in important respects
from existing forms. It follows from this that a revision of the classification of
Ophiuroidea is necessary.
