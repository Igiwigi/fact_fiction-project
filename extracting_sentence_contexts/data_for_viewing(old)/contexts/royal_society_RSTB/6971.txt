POST-GLACIAL HISTORY OF BRITISH VEGETATION 301

began, but it was certainly continuing in the early part of the Roman period. On the
salt-marsh landscape, heavily marked with the wriggling courses of tidal creeks, the
Roman period agriculturalists established themselves in great numbers, so that for the
first time the fens took on an orderly and artificial appearance like that of to-day. This
effect was, however, restricted to the seaward “‘marshes’’. Further inland Romano-
British agriculture spread its fields along the silt banks of the river channels, but
behind these banks lay the waterlogged sedge fens, cut off from drainage to the rivers,
and quite unused by man. We have yet to learn the extent of the drainage works under-
taken in this period: there are many indications that they were extensive, and there is
some evidence that they were carried out during the last stages of the marine invasion
itself. It is a striking fact that the silts of this marine invasion reflect marine conditions
more strongly marked than those of the fen clay invasion, and it is clear that strong
tides must have flowed far up the fen rivers during their deposition.

From this time onwards the fen strata yield less and less evidence of former conditions,
and we pass progressively into the territory of the geographical historian. We need only
recall that throughout the dark ages the fenlands remained virtually untenanted. Not
only do the wet peatlands yield no trace of human occupation, but even the fertile silt
lands exploited in the Roman period were abandoned. The cause of this change is
unknown. Peat was formed over the silt banks of the Roman river system, and reached
a height of about 12 ft. O.D. round the fen margin. At the time of Domesday the chief
wealth of the fenland lay in wild fowl and fish, which were abundant in the rivers and
