If the two sets correspond, i.c., the d sequent and the F (c) for this set are the same,
the D group must belong not to 20551 but to a parallel D group in which the limit
is 812°73—269°39 = 43°34 behind the normal D(). Now this is the separation of
20556 behind 20600. In fact the separation of 20556 and 20869 is 312'66. This
further indicates that 20556 is a D, line in the position shown in the above table, in
which the corresponding D, line is too weak to have been seen. This also gives another
F separation—85—with 20642.
