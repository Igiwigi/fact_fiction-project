Grorravss is inclined to believe that the elements of water, when
about to separate at the poles, combine with the electricities, and 80 become
gases. M. ps 14 Rive's view is the exact reverse of this: whilst passing
through the fluid, they are, according to him, compounds with the electricities;
when evolved at the poles, they are de-electrified.

516. I have sought amongst the various experiments quoted in support of
these views, or connected with electro-chemical decompoxsitions or electric cur-
rents, for any which might be considered as sustaining the theory of two elec-
tricities rather than that of one, but have not been able to perceive a single
fact which could be brought forward for such a purpose: or, admitting the
hypothesis of two electricities, much less have I been able to perceive the
slightest grounds for believing that one electricity in a current can be more
powerful than the other, or that it can be present without the other, or that one
can be varied, or in the slightest degree affected, without a corresponding va-
riation in the other. If, upon the supposition of two electricities, a current of
one can be obtained without the other, or the current of one be exalted or di-
minished more than the other, we might surely expect some variation either of
the chemical or magnetical effects, or of both; but no snch variations have been
obseryed. If a current be s0 directed that it may act chemically in one part
of its course, and magnetically in another, the two actions are always found to
take place together.
