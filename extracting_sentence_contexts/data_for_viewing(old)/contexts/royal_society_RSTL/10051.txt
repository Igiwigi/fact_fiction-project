Garnx (5) aid that the organ has attained its greates 8ize in newly born animals,
and diminishes after birth.

This view, that ib decreases very rapidly after birth, seems to have been held from
this time until the latter half of the seventeenth century ; although M6oprus (6)
noticed a thymus in the post-mortem examination of a man thirty years old.

G11880N (7), 1671, found that it is large in children.

MaxGervs (8), 1717, said that the gland is very large in newly born children, but

& decreases during childhood.
GA VERHEYEN (9), 1726, was the firs who definitely presented the fact that the
iz thymus grows after birth. He aid that it is larger in children some years old, than
in those newly born.
S Hewsox (10), 1777, said that the gland enlarges to the end of the firs year ; and
3 since his time it has been generally accepted, that the growth of the gland is not
= terminated by the duration of fcetal life.
S Tt was in the end of the seventeenth century that two anatomical statements were
= put forward, both of which delayed for a long time a more extended knowledge of
z this organ. One statement was as fruitful a source of physiological error as the other
was of anatomical misconception.
2 Tn 1670, Verscn (11), in the Alpine Marmot, confounded the fat glands and the
S thymus. This confusion between fat glands and thymus, which was a very natural
S one, was continued by HARDER (12), SCHEUCHZER (13), PALLAs (14), MecKkEL (15),
