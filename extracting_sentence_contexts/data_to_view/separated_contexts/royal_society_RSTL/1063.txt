When the ass, on which the respiratory nerve of the
face had been cut, was killed, which was done by bleeding,
an unexpected opportunity was offered of ascertaining its
influence, by the negation of its powers on the side of the
face where it was cut across. 414 Mr. BeLr's experiments on the $tructure

When an animal becomes insensible from loss of blood,
the impression at the heart extends its influence in violent
convulsions over all the muscles of respiration; not only is the
air drawn into the chest with sudden and powerful effort, but
at the same instant the muscles of the mouth, nostrils, and
eyelids, and all the side of the face, are in a violent state of
spasm. In the ass, where the respiratory nerve of the face
had been cut, the most remarkable contrast was exhibited
in the two sides- of its face ; for whilst the one side was in
universal and powerful contraction,: the other, where the
nerve was divided, remained quite placid

From these facts we are entitled to conclude, that the portio
dura of the 'seventh, is the respiratory-nerve of the face;
that the motions of the lips, the nostrils, and the velum
palati are governed by its influence, when the muscles of
these parts are in associated action with the other organs of
respiration. These passages to the lungs are membranous
tubes, moved by muscles, which serve to:expand and widen
them, 80 that the air may freely enter into the lungs. It is ob-
vious that to produce this, these muscles must have a consent
with the other muscles of respiration, and move simultane-
ously with them ; and this is effected through the respiratory
nerve of the face.
