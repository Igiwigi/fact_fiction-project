long wavelengths [54,55], and the mice thus may experience
red light as less intense and therefore evade the red-coloured
light to a lesser extent than green and white. At present, it is
unclear whether the reduction in activity is caused by a direct
behavioural response to light, or whether there is a density
effect, with a reduced abundance underneath the lampposts.

(e) Summary

In summary, we do observe direct effects on a number of
species, and see emerging long-term effects. These vary
with different speciesâ€”the response of wood mice may be
