The
determinant of M can be written in the form

where each p; is a polynomial in its arguments and (cio =(0,A7}+4,-A-1 +4,a71 - A,
—A71 —d). For large values of k, exp(k¢1) is the dominant term and thus, p; must vanish in order
for the determinant to vanish in that limit. This polynomial—which has total degree 34—-vanishes
whenever 4 is equal to either a particular root of the equation

The root in question is not present in the case 6 = 1 (this is in fact the classical Biot instability
of an elastic half space as the two layers can no longer be distinguished), but, when it exists, it

Figure 2. The maxima of the dispersion curves of det(M) = 0 in the A-k plane provide the first critical values of A at which :
oscillatory solutions can be obtained. For instance, the critical compression A, and wavenumber K,, are indicated for the top a
curve.
