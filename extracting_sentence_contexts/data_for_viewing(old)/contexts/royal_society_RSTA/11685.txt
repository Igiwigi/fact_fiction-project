causes the instant reversal of the direction of movement of the bands.

On attaching one of the shafts to the endless screw and to the large control-wheel,
the traverse of the microscope and of g; can be equally and much more conveniently
and delicately effected and controlled, in the manner already fully described in the
last section. The calculated number of bands, namely 15 for red hydrogen light, pass
most accurately for each revolution of the wheel, and the steadiness and “dead beat”
nature of the motion is very pleasing.

Indeed, the most satisfactory thing about the whole interference method is that the
slightest fault, productive of inaccuracy of measurement, is at once visibly indicated
by irregular movement, twisting, alteration of width, or complete disappearance of the
bands. The fact that during the operation of measuring the difference of length
between two bars—involving the traverse of the microscope through the length
corresponding to this difference—the bands move with the precision which has just
been stated, is the final proof of the success of the method and of the instrument now
described.

The author desires to record his appreciation of the most kind help and
encouragement invariably received from the Deputy Warden of the Standards,
Major P. A. MacManon, F.R.S., to whose initiative the whole of this advance in fine
measurement at the Standards Department is due. Further, to express his deep
indebtedness to Mr. F. Srantey Reap of the Standards Department, and to
Mr. J. SkrNNER of Messrs. Troughton & Simms, for untiring aid and many excellent
suggestions during the design and construction of the apparatus. The author's thanks
