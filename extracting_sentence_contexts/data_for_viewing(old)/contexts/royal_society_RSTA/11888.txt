broken away in cutting down into the sulphur round the plates in order to increase
the surface resistance. We may call the area 190 sq. centims. The micrometer screws
were adjusted so as to leave a film space of ‘05 centim. This was therefore the
thickness of the film. So much difficulty was experienced in screwing the screws back
that it was determined for the future to use some other method of separating the
gilded plates. During the attempts that were made to get a value of the resistance
of the film, several facts came to light on which our subsequent practice was founded.

The first was with respect to the necessity for insulating every part of the appa-
ratus. Our connecting keys proving unfit for such high resistance work, new ones
were made out of rods of ebonite about 20 centims. long, and were so arranged that it
was easy to get at the ebonite in every part for the purpose of scraping it with bits
of broken glass—a very effective way of cleaning it. It was also found that there
was a considerable amount of surface conductivity over the sulphur, and we finally
were obliged to use phosphorus pentoxide as a drying agent, anything less active fail-
ing to give satisfactory results. The battery of test-tube sterage cells was reinforced
by a water battery* consisting of zinc and copper plates, as described by Professor
Row anp (‘ Phil. Mag.’ [5], vol. 23, p. 303).
