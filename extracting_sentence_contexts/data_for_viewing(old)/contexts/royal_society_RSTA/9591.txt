molecule and of such modification of that structure as is produced by the mutual
actions between the molecules.

Thus stated, the diamagnetic property of a substance depends upon the molecule
asa whole. The above hypothesis postulates no definite structure of the atom or
molecule beyond that it is capable of assuming a slightly distorted configuration due
to the influence of neighbouring atoms or molecules.

The interpretation of the experimental facts (described in Part I. of this communi-
cation) by means of the electron theory of magnetism will be withheld until the
results have been discussed from the molecular standpoint.

The magnetic potential energy of a body placed in a magnetic field may be written
W = â€”3,MH?

where x is the specific susceptibility of the substance, M the mass of the body, and H
the intensity of the magnetic field. For a small displacement of the body,
