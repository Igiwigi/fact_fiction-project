The loudes sounds are
heard when P is placed in the axis of the jet at a certain distance from the orifice ;
and the reproduction grows fainter as the electrode P is moved from this poxition,
either towards the orifice or laterally. The telephonic effects are feeble, but such as they are they cannot be attributed to
the interposition of varying liquid resistances between the conductors. Under these conditions, in fact, a liquid jet becomes comparable to a jet of air. MR. C.
