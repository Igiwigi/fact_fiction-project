There is
never any trace of more than two, and as the sections cut the laminz at all angles,
indications of others must have been met with if a larger number had been present. The elongated form of the lamina also points to its being bisporangiate. The fact
that laminze showing two sporangia appear both in transverse and longitudinal
sections, might have led to the inference that there were four in all, as in
Cheirostrobus or Calamostachys, if they appeared at all constantly in both planes. This, however, is not the case; it is rather the exception, in each plane of section,
for the two sporangia to appear, while narrow sections of lamin showing only one
sporangium, if any, are frequent. Thus all indications point to the conclusion that
the sporangiophores each bore two sporangia, and no more, as in the Bowmanites
RÃ©imeri of Count Solms-Laubach.
