98 Sir GrorGE SHUCKBURGH's Account

From inspection of the preceding table of observations it
will readily appear, that I was much mistaken in my ex-
pectation of an eccentricity of 8 or 10”, for that, in truth,
there seemed to be no fixed cause of error ; and that therefore
the error of the centre had little to do in occasioning those
differences in the opposite microscopes, which only once
amounted to 4, and this in fact was double the error of
the centre added to the sum of the errors in the two op-
posite divisions, together- with the error of twice reading
off; and that the simple error never exceeded, and but once
amounted to 1”,6. This being the case, I think it fair to
conclude, that the eccentricity never amounted to any sen-
Sible or measurable quantity, viz. never exceeded 1”,* and
that consequently all the variety we see, in the west or oppo-
site microscope, arose from the error of the divisions, ine-
quality of the points, imperfection in reading off, or a little
play in the screw of the micrometer.
