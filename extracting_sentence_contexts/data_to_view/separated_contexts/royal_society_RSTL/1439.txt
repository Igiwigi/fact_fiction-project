If the mass of the sun be considered as 330.000 times that
of the earth, the distance at which his force is equal to gra-

vity will be +/339.000, or about 575 times the earth's radius;
and if his radius be 111,5 times that of the earth, then this

. distance will be £5

5 OT 5-15 times the sun's radius; and

15' 49x 5,15 =1* 21' 29”, will be the apparent distance from
the sun's centre on the 2gd of May, when the following ob-
servatiuns were made, :

What deduction should be allowed for the effect of heat,

* Such an atmosphere would, in fact, be of greater density on account of the far
greater extent of the medium affected by the solar attraction, although of extreme
rarity ; but the addition derived from this source, may be disregarded in the present
estimate, without prejudice to the argument, which will not be found to turn upon
any minute difference. finite extent of the atmosphere. 93

It may be time to consider when we have learned the amount
of apparent refraction at some given distance; and we may
then begin to conjecture, whether heat can counteract the
increase of density that would occur in the approach of only
2; of a second towards his centre.
