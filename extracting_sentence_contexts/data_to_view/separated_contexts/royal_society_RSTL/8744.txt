Doubtless even this assumption represents a state of

to regard the hypothetical plexus as presenting the high degree of integration charac-

undue length, discuss this subject.

(c) The strongest evidence of definite lines of discharge being present, however, is
yet to be adduced; and this consists in the following invariable fact :! â€”At whatever point
in a strip that is being progressively elongated by 8ection the contractile wave becomes
blocked, the blocking is ure to take place completely and exclusively at that point. Whereas
up to the time that the incision reached quite up to that point the contractile waves
showed no signs of meeting with any resistance in their passage from the severed strip
to the rest of the gonocalyx, immediately after the incision is carried through that point
the blocking of the contractile waves is total.
