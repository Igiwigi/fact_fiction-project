In the case of thin plates, this light is transmitted in other
rings: we Should therefore be led to think that in the case of
the light passing by bodies, it should be at one distance in-
flected, and at another deflected: and in fact the phanomena
agree with this, for fringes are formed by inflexion within the
Shadows of bodies; they are separated by dark intervals ; the
fringes and the intervals without the $shadow decrease in breadth
according to the same law; s0 that the fringes and intervals
within the shadow correspond with the intervals and fringes
without, respectively. Nor will this explanation at all affect
the theory formerly laid down; it will only (if found consistent
with farther induction) change the definite spheres of inflexion
and deflexion into alternate spheres. At any rate, the facts here
being the same with those described by NewTox, but in diffe-
rent circumstances, teach us: to reconcile the difference, which

we have attempted to do; as far as is consistent with strictness;
and what we have seen not only entitles us to conclude that
. the cause is the same, but also inclines us to look for farther
light concerning that cause's general operation: and I trust
some experiments which 1 have planned, with an instrument
contrived for the purpose of investigating the ratio of the bend-
ing power to the distances at which it acts, will finally settle
this point.

1. Another conclusion follows from the experiments now
related, viz. that we see the great importance of having spe-
cula for reflectors delicately polished; not only because the more
dark imperfections there are on the surface, the more light is
lost, and the more colours are produced by flexion (these co-
lours would be mostly mixed and form white in the focus), but
also because the smallest scratches or hairs, being polished,
produce colours by reflexion, and these diverging irregularly
from the point of incidence are never collected into a focus, but
tend to confuse the image. Indeed it is wonderful that re-
flectors do not suffer more from this cause, considering the
almost impossibility of avoiding the hairs we speak of: how-
ever, that they do actually suffer is proved by experience.
