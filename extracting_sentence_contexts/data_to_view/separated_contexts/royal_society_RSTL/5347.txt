The greatest and least, roots of [q, q2---4,] X [qu+1-+-4qz| evidently satisfy the-con-
dition to which L and A are subject, and may. be taken in place of L and A
respectively. They will accordingly be superior and inferior limits to the cumulant

but so that this sign changes in passing from one series to another, it is easily seen,
by the same reasoning as in the preceding case,. that the two positiye and two nega-
tive products on the right-hand side of the equation all give the same sign to the co-
efficient of the highest power of x, and consequently that if L and A be superior and

it follows, returning to the theorem to be. demonstrated,, that the greatest and least
