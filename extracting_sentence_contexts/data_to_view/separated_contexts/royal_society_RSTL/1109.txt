The more diminutive inequalities scattered over the whole
surface of our area, and always produced by interruptions of
the strata, would still more easily admit the appplication of
the ame reasoning, from the contiguity of their -abrupted
parts ; but the detail would be tedious; those who wish- to
pursue the subject ſarther must come to the scene-them-

selves. Materials completely carried off. A circumstance perhaps till more extraordinary, is the
complete removal of all the materials that once filled up the
intervals between the abrupted parts of these strata ; I have
$tated in my gth fact, that the materials that had formerly

composed the projecting parts of our northern fagades, and
precipices, had totally disappeared. The removed parts of the limestone stratum on the west
Side of our” area have Shared the same fate, for where the
chain of mountains extending from Mag!//;gan Rock to Bien-
braddock, is interrupted by vallies at Stradreagh, Drumrommer,
and Ballyness, it is'6bvious that the limestone stratum was
once continuous to the high points where-it shews itself on
Keady, andthe mountains 'on each side ; its thickness too,
wherever we can try it, is very great; yet this stratum, which
in its entire: state must have spread like a roof far above the
present surface of these valleys (which are now sunk deep
into the schistose substratum) has not left a particle of its
debris behind, nor is a single lump of white limestone to be
found, until we come to the quarries, that is, to the edge of the
Solid, untouched stratum. Conclusions.
