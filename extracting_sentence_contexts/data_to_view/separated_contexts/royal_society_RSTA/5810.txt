where we denote by Q,(x) the cube of side-length r > 0 centred at x € 4, and we set [8

D={xeR!: lim A,(x) =f(x)}. :g

By the Lebesgue differentiation theorem, we have |R4 \ D|=0. The assumption that / is not a
constant function translates into f #0, which in turn guarantees the existence of 5 > 0 and of a
bounded set D c D, with |D| > 0, such that

This means that, for every x € D, there exists 7; > 0 with the property

We can therefore iteratively pick a monotonic sequence {A} satisfying
O<An<e™", dn 10, (3.4)

and choose the centres x; € D of the cubes in such a way that the cubes Q7,,, (x) are disjoint and,
setting Q; = Q),,(%n), we have

Mn>Cat?, vn. (3.5)

The existence of the sequences {x;} and {A,} as above is guaranteed by the fact that we can
inductively choose x; and 4, > 0 (small enough) to have

P\Uent >0, Yn.

The fact that D has been chosen to be bounded guarantees that {x;,} can be chosen to be a
convergent sequence and {Q7;,,(%n)} to be contained in a bounded set. We conclude that {Qn}
is our desired sequence of cubes. Step 3.
