structure theory. We then ran 160000 NVE trajectories on a large slab of diamond, and the
results are in reasonable agreement with experiment: they suggest that energy dissipation from
surface hotspots is complete within a few hundred femtoseconds, but that a small fraction
of CH3 does in fact undergo dissociation prior to the onset of thermal equilibrium. Second,
we developed and tested a general procedure to formulate and solve the energy-grained
master equation (EGME) for surface chemistry problems. The procedure we outline splits the
diamond slab into system and bath components, and then evaluates microcanonical transition-
state theory rate coefficients in the configuration space of the system atoms. Energy transfer
from the system to the bath is estimated using linear response theory from a single long
MD trajectory, and used to parametrize an energy transfer function which can be input into
the EGME. Despite the number of approximations involved, the surface EGME results are in
reasonable agreement with the NVE MD simulations, but considerably cheaper. The results a]
are encouraging, because they offer a computationally tractable strategy for investigating :
non-equilibrium reaction dynamics at surfaces for a broader range of systems. :§
