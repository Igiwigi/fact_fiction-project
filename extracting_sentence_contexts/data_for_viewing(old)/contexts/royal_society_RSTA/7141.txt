group containing subgroups G,, such that any two different such subgroups intersect in
a fixed group H, then we can choose systems S,, of left coset representatives of the G, modulo
H and define normal words as before. If the element pe P belongs to the subgroup of P
generated by all the G,—and only then—it can be written in the form

with each g, lying in a group G,, and no two successive ones in the same. The process
described above then assigns to / a well-defined normal word (of length n, ifn >1; of length

which represents /. If P is not generated by the G,, then there will be elements of P which
are not represented by any normal word; and if P is not the generalized free product of the
G,, then there may be elements represented by more than one normal word. In fact we can
prove a converse of theorem (2-4) :

TueoreM. Let the group P have subgroups G,(ae A) which intersect pairwise in a common
subgroup H. ;
i G,.Gy=H (a,feA, a+f).

If every element p« P is represented by at least one normal word (as defined above) and if normal words
of different lengths represent different elements of P, then P is the generalized free product of the G,,
and thus in particular every element is represented by a unique} normal word. (3-3)
Proof. The subgroups G, generate P, as every element of P is assumed to be represented
by a normal word. As generators of G, we choose all its elements; the defining relations can
be taken, one for every ordered pair of elements of G,, to state which element of G, is their
