The Theory of Interpoints and the Theory of Dimensions give two
separate answers to this question. The points in the linear concepts, being only
classes of objective reals, are capable of disintegration. In fact, when motion is
considered, it will be found that the points of one instant are, in general, different
from the points of another instant, not in the sense of Concept III. that they are the
same entities with different relations, but in the sense that they are different entities,
More difficulty will probably be felt in conceiving anything analogous to a line as a
simple unity. Here it is to be observed that a linear objective real does not replace
a line of points of ordinary geometry.
