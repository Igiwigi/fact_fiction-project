In his objections Macxus, for the most part, dealt with true canses, but he erred as
to their scope of action. I never denied the existence of the dangers which he empha-

of my experiments. These, as I have 80 frequently stated, were conducted with pla

rocksalt is hygroscopic, I demur to its application.

A similar remark applies to the lasb solution offered by Macxus of the differen
between us. In 1867, he showed that vapours were condensed by surface attra
to a greater extent than had previously been supposed. Blowing vapour-laden ai
into a metal tube, he found that heat was generated. He inferred, and right]
inferred, that this heat was produced by the condensation which occurred on the
interior surface. This condensation he found to depend on the condition of
surface, being greater when it was tarnished or coated than when it was polish
He saturated air with moisture at a temperature of 16* C., and then raised both i
and his pile to a temperature of 38%, When such air was blown against the dry face
of the pile heat was generated. Condensation therefore occurred upon a snrfacs
