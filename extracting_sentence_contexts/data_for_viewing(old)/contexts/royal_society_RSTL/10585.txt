superphosphate in addition, there were 12 that came into this category. The
result, was a somewhab more mixed herbage 80 far as the gramineous components were
concerned, due, however, it is to be supposed, rather to more of maturing tendency,
and therefore of consolidation, giving weight, than to increased luxuriance of the
species which came the more into prominence.

Among the five Miscellanees coming into the foremost lis, Rumex Acetosa was, as
in other cases, by far the most prominent ; next in order coming Achillea Millefolium,
Conopodium denudatum, Centaurea nigra, and various species of Ranunculus. But
of these, Rumen declined from more than 13 to only 3 per cent.; the species of
Ranumeulus almost disappeared ; Conopodium denudatum and Achillea Millefolium also
declined, although in the second cuttings the Achillea has, in the later years, 8ghown
even more prominence than the /tumez, owing probably to the fact that it is Jess in-
jured by cutting, and more particularly to the cireumstance that the Rumez is more
adyanced in development at the time of the firs cutting, and is therefore more
exhausted by the profusion of seed that is formed, and is less ready to produce
shoots in the aftermath. The only miscellaneous species that showed any tendeney
to increase, though occurring in comparatively small actual quantity, was Centaurea
nigra. Upon the whole, however, the percentage of the Miscellanez diminished very
greatly in the later years, as that of the Graminez increased.

Compared with the produce without manure, the ammonia-salts and superphosphate
of lime gave a very large, and greatly increasing, actual amount of Festuea oving and
Agrostis vulgaris. This mixture also gave more of each of the Poas, more also, but in
a rapidly decreasing ratio, of Alopecurus pratensis and Holcus lanatus, and slightly
