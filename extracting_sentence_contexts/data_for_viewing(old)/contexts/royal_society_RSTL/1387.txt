from which, and. the little. agreement that .can. be found be-
tween the elements of. the orbits of all the. comets that have
been observed, it appears clearly that they may be directed to
carry their salutary influence to any part of the heavens.

My hypothesis, however, as before observed, does: not. lay
me-under any obligation to explain how the sun can-sustain
the waste of 'light, nor'to shew_ that it will sustain [it for ever ;
and I should also remark that, as inthe analogy of generating
clouds I merely-allude-to their production -as owing to.a'de-
composition-of some of the elastic. fluids of our atmosphere,
that analogy, which firmly rests upon; the fact, will not/be less
to my purpose to whatever cause these clouds may owe their
origin. It is the-same with the lucid clouds, if I may-s0-call
them, of the sun. They plainly exist, because we see them 5
the manner of their being generated may,remain an hypothe-
sis; and mine, till a better can be proposed, may stand-good ;
but whether. it, does or not, the consequences I am-going to
draw from what has been aid will not be affected by it.

Before I proceed, I shall only. point out, that according to
the aboye theory, a dark-spot in the sun is a place in-its atmo-
