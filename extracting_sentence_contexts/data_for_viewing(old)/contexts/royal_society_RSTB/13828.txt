(b) Key ideas in evolutionary theories of music
Evolutionary theories of music are often linked to those
of language. There are at least two main aspects that can be
discussed separately: (i) the link between animal precursors
and human music and language channels, and (ii) the evol-
ution of human acoustic communication (including music
and language).

(i) Animal precursors

Non-human acoustic communication has been compared to
both language and music. In fact, vocalizations from many
species are often called songs, because of their complexity
and because they are learned [6]. However, except for gibbons,
tarsiers, indri and perhaps also marmosets, tamarins and titi
monkeys (see e.g. [86,87]), these complex song-like vocaliza-
tions occur only in birds and non-primate mammals such as
cetaceans, suggesting that they do not share a common evol-
utionary path with music, or any other learned, complex
human acoustic signals like language (but see e.g. [88]).
There are, however, certain similarities and potential instances
of convergent evolution that can provide models for the evol-
ution of human acoustic communication (see [6,89]). Vocal
learning, for example, seems to work in an analogous way in
