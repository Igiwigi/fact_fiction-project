Evolution experiments allow researchers to observe how the community complexity.

is ideal for studying the repeatability of evolution driven
by intrinsic factors, although controlled disturbances or
migration can also be added [106,107]. Furthermore, the
fact that all replicates are observed by the experimentalist—
rather than a possibly biased subset of them—avoids the

denominator problem and makes it possible to quantify the the problem of repeatability faces a major challenge. What
