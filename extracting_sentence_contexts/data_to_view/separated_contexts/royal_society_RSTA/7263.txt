The measurements obtained from stations 1 and 3 do not
allow the calculation of this limiting velocity with an accuracy as great as that obtainable
from station 2. The second assumption which has been made is that the velocity in the
layer lying above that with velocity 20400 ft./s (6-22 km/s) on station 3 is the same as that
of the analogous layer of station 2, namely, 16200 ft./s (4:94 km/s). In view of the fact
that a layer of similar velocity was also found under station 1 this assumption is the most
plausible. It results, however, in the conclusion that the thickness of layer 1 is considerably less
than at the other two stations. With the positions of the observations as obtained by the
shipâ€™s navigating officers this conclusion is geologically difficult to interpret.
