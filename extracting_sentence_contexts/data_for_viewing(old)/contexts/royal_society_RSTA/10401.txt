in one hemisphere there is a central continent (Africa) nearly surrounded by a belt of
seas, while in the antipodal hemisphere there is a central ocean (the Pacific) nearly
surrounded by a ring of land, the belt and ring being broken at three places, which
are distributed nearly symmetrically around the centres of the two hemispheres.
This description suggests very strongly a mathematical account expressed in terms of
surface harmonies of the third degree.

If we neglect the rotation of the planet, and regard it as at rest under no external
forces, we can reach no other result than that reached by JEANS, viz., that, if the
modulus of compression was once so small that a spherically symmetrical state of
aggregation would have been unstable, the state of the planet would have been one
of lateral disturbance with a hemispherical distribution of density. We should not
be in a position to account at all for the geographical facts as presented by Sonnas.

46. The Earth is a rotating globe, and it is now generally believed to be the
larger of two fragments into which a single body has been broken up; the other
fragment is the Moon. In the early history of the Earth-Moon system the two
fragments rotated, nearly as a single rigid body; the period of revolution of the
Moon was nearly the same as the period of rotation of the Earth. We wish to trace
the consequences of supposing that the average elasticity of the material was once
much smaller than it is at presentâ€”that the average modulus of compression was
more of the order of that of mercury, or even water, than of that of glass or steel,
and the average rigidity was smaller in comparison with the modulus of compression
than it is to-day. We have the problem of determining the distribution of density
within the planet, and the consequent shape of its surface. The problem cannot be
