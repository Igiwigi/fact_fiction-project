be accomplished, to ascertain the lower part of the British
series of strata, thus only exposed to view, in local and uncon-
nected tracts, or basins, which are in part often concealed by
gravel (frequently s0, near their borders), and towards which
investigation, little has yet been done. It seems to me, that
there are three distinct series of coal-measures, if not more,
Separated by thick strata of red earths, or marles, not easily
distinguished from the upper one above the coal series, or
that which underlays the lias strata, as abovementioned, and
by thick strata of limestones ; each of which red earths, pro-
bably, produce anomalous and local strata, or crystallized
mountain masses, in different places, where they form the
surface, and the fact of such containing no organic remains,
may not have arisen from their having been formed before
organized beings existed, as those contend who call them
primitive rocks, but because the circumstances proper to crys-
tallization, were unfitted to the propagation and life of either
animals, or vegetables; and may it not be doubted, whether
crystallized masses, great or small, are ever the seats of re-
liquia ?

The northern part of Derbyshire, and the adjoining parts
of the surrounding counties, present a denudated tract, and
partake of this uncertainty, as to what place in the lower part
of the British series of strata, its strata should be referred :
