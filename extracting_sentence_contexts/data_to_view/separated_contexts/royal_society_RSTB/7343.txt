ULLYETT ON COMPETITION FOR FOOD AND

are certainly not desirable in the present instance. There is no evidence that larvae of Lucilia
and C. chloropyga compete for food in this sense. The simple fact is that there is often
insufficient food to go round, and this arises solely through the improvident manner in
which parent flies distribute their eggs. An analogous case is seen among the slum dwellers of our great cities where the very poor
produce large families in spite of the fact that food is normally scarce among such communi-
ties. It can hardly be said that children in these families ‘compete’ for the available food.
