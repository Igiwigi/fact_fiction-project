(where y, = y= ¥, = 0) and C at C,g, and is a ruled surface. The 0! directrix curves
meeting Ay, are conics except for a unique straight line y', the generating line ayc, of 2

in fact.

Incidentally the above geometrical process throws light on the somewhat obscure
algebraical fact that in reducing a matrix pencil to canonical form it is the minimal
index of lowest value which first presents itself.
When D has a single minimal index , and therefore a single curve .1°, of order 7),
the canonical form of the corresponding space Y/ is explicable as follows: This curve

meets two strata A and C in single points a, and ¢; say. The osculating systems of these

points interlock and at once give rise to chains @, dy ..., ¢{¢3 ... of index n,, where the set

c, is the set ¢,¢c, ... in reversed order. This process fixes the frame of reference which leads
to the canonical form of ¥. It may be verified by the methods of § 15.

For example, if.1 is a twisted cubic and 2, = 8, then ¥ is the containing [3]: a, is
