or what is the 8ame thing, for n writing its value Zap,

y= 0,00, + 4310 mpe— {En — Emo — En + 198

where in the first 8um 1, 8 have each of them the values 1, 2,...k, subject to the
condition 8>7; in each of the other 8nms n, m, and þ are considered as having the
suffix 7, which has the values 1,2,...k.

Tt is a leading result in RIEMANN's theory of the Abelian integrals that y is the
deficiency (Geschlecht) of the curve represented by the equation x(z, y)=0 : and it
must consequently be demonstrable @ posteriort that the foregoing expression for y is
in fact, = deficiency of curve x(z, y)=0. I propose to verify this by means of the
formule given in my paper © On the Higher Singularities of a Plane Curve,” Quart.
