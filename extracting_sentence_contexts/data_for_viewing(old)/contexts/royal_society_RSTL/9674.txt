himself, :

There follows an addition from Professor CAYLEY, wherein it is shown that the
expression found in art, 20 for the least value of the number of conditions connecting
the variables of the integrals we sum is equal to the deficiency (Geschlecht) of the curve
represented by the equation y(z, y)=0. That this least value is equal to the deficiency
is a leading result in Riaxx's theory of the Abelian integrals ; the assumptions
made in the text as to the form of the roots of the equation x(z, y)=0 considered
as an equation for the determination of y are equivalent to the assumption that the
curve x(z, )=0 has certain singularities ; and i is in the addition shown that the
resulting value of the deficiency, as calculated by the formule in Professor CavLey' 8
paper *On the Higher Singularities of a Plane Curve,” Quart. Math. Journ., vol. vii.
(1866), pp. 212-222, has in fact the foregoing value, ;

1. The general question to which an answer is sought in what is called the Theory
of the Comparison of Transcendants may be stated thus :—

1s it always possible to establish, between the values for different variables of the
integral of an algebraic function however complex, algebraic relations: the variables
