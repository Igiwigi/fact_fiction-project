The differentiation of principal filaments may possibly be connected in some obscure
way with the fact that these alone contain the afferent branchial blood channels, the
arterialised blood finding its way back to the auricle from the ordinary filaments.
This direction of the blood stream is a matter upon which Bonnet,f Sturrer and
Haren-Norman are agreed; but I am not in a position to express an opinion upon
it since, the whole of the material available being preserved in alcohol, I have not
injected any specimens. M4&ntaaux, it should be noted, regards the blood as passing
down one principal filament and back by the next, the principal filaments of each
lamella being thus alternately afferent and efferent (62, p. 175. Solen and some
other forms), and Jonnstone (40, fig. 26) in his investigations of Cardiuwm has
arrived at the same conclusion.

What it is important to note in this connection is the fact that principal filamentsâ€™
are ontogenetically a secondary differentiation. No genus could be better adapted
for an investigation of this point than Pecten, since in this genus there is a remark-
ably strong contrast in size between the principal and ordinary filaments. In
*Pecten irradians Jackson has described (38, p. 836) a stage in which the filaments
are fully reflected, and yet the interlamellar septa which, he remarks, occur on every
eleventh to fifteenth filament of the adult gill, are not developed; and (judging by
his figure, Plate 28, fig. 1) the filaments are all alike in size and shape.

* Jt is worthy of note that he regards the simplicity of the flat forms as secondary, and derived by
retrogression from the plicate condition.

T In Pecten jacobeus, however, BONNET considers the principal filament to be carrying arterial blood.
