whilst it has already been mentioned that kp is falling as & increases but less rapidly
than 1/k.

7. Comparison of Calculated and Observed Resistances,

It is not possible to make an accurate comparison with experiment for the reason
that observation has not been extended to cover two-dimensional flow. Experiments
were made by Froupg on the resistance of boards towed through water, but the greatest
dimension was in the direction of motion, whilst the dimension across the stream was
much smaller. In air ZauM made similar experiments, and Stanton has shown that
both sets are in general agreement. The resistance coefficient does in fact fall continu-
ously with increase in k. The values of & are much greater than the 10,000 used in
our present calculations.

For the purposes of comparison, use will be made of a special experiment by StanTon.*
The plate was thin, 18 ins. long in the direction of the stream and 3 ins. across it, so
that two-dimensional flow cannot be assumed to a high degree of approximation. The
surface was ground flat, and the leading and back edges were bevelled off to a knife-edge
on one side, so that the eddy-making at these edges should be a minimum. Attempts
were made to determine the intensity of the skin friction, for which part of the method
seems particularly suitable, but the flow was found to be unsymmetrical on the two
sides of the plate and further experiment was deferred. There is evidence of the
