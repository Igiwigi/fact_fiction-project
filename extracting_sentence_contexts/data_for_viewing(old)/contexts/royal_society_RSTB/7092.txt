and the improved opportunity which this would afford for trees with powers of rapid
colonization and high light requirements. The data here given allow this hypothesis to be
tested.

Since early agriculture and stratigraphy have been shown to be correlated, and we now
see forest history and stratigraphy correlated, agriculture and forest history must evidently
also be correlated, but it remains to consider whether the agricultural clearance or climatic
change is responsible for the pronounced modification of the tree-pollen curves.

1. Many reasons support the view that the control was climatic. The fall in Alnus is too
big and too sudden for an anthropogenous effect: it might be conceived that this tree
suffered selective felling, for the wood is easy to work and is often found in Late Bronze Age
utensils, but in fact Alnus increased in amount after agriculture had begun (120 to 110 cm.),
and moreover there is so large a proportion of Alnus in the diagram that the amount of
disforestation needed to produce the observed drop in the Alnus pollen curve cannot be
envisaged. It might be suggested that Alnus was largely growing on the valley floors and
margins and that rise of the flood-waters killed it out, but although this may have been
true in part the proportion in which Alnus occurs at the base of the series makes it most
probable that this tree was a normal constituent of the forest, and that what we are here
concerned with was a shift in upland forest composition.

2. Alnus is only slightly repressed, if at all, at the second flooding phase, although the
agricultural intensity is much greater than before.

3. The drop in Tilia is most unlikely to have been due to selective felling, for there
