Neither will the
death-rate, which is higher for coloured females than it is for males, account for the
excess of coloured females, while the birth-rate is almost exactly equal as regards
sex. And yet, as is the case for whites, the native born coloured women are in excess. The fact that females are now in excess, both among white and coloured native
born, leads me to suggest that the war is responsible for this result. I can find no
evidence of any other cause which will explain it, and feel confident it cannot be
attributed to any of the causes which Ganron found sufficient to account for the
excess of females in the West Indies.
