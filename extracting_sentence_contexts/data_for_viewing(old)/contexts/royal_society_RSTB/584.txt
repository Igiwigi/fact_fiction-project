should work out, from his own subject alone, what he conceived to be the most
natural divisions of the earth’s surface, and that these might ultimately be combined
so as to arrive at a correct solution of the problem. Mr. ScLarer appears to have
meant that each enquirer should use his own system of geography of reference. It is
evident that the combination of results contemplated by ScraTeR would be hardly
possible if the enquirers used different systems, but could be done by a clerk if all the
enquirers worked on one framework. The large tabulations done by ENGLER and
others, the complex maps of geographic botany published, the innumerable systems of
regions proposed as the most natural (down to the last I have seen, that of Professor
Morpstus, in ‘Nature, for 8rd December, 1891, p. 104), utterly defy all attempts at
general combination. To collect even general conclusions from these huge labours in
the form in which they have been published, demands not only great toil, but the
separating out the facts and retabulating them on one system before the results can
be added together, in other words the doing of the work over again.

Mr. WALLACE foresaw and unavailingly deprecated the course which his successors
would pursue in the matter of biologic regions. He foresaw that, as his regions were
constructed to represent the existing distribution of Mammalia (so far as then known)
only, the distribution of other vertebrates being only brought in to settle doubtful
points, and geologic evidence being excluded, other enquirers would use regions
representing more accurately the distribution of their own groups, with complex
maps. In this way, his earnest wish to establish one set of regions as “ typical,” d.e.,
one map of reference areas, has been completely defeated.

The object of the present paper is to show that what is wanted is to separate
