If
we pull on the pelvic fins or lower prong of the hook, the urohyal rotates, lowering
the anterior upper end; the hyoids are thus retracted downwards, then the intero-
percula open and these, through their connection with the articular, open the lower
jaw sufficiently for the geniohyoid muscle to continue the process. Other changes are found in this ventral region, in the hyoid and branchial arches,
as well as in the pharyngeal muscles; the membrane connecting the urohyal with the
cleithra may even be separated from one of the cleithra, the interbranchial septum
may be ruptured (Lepidorhombus, etc., fig. 27); but these need not be dealt with
here. The significant fact is, that important changes have occurred in the ventral
mechanism which has to’do with the opening of the mouth, just as in the dorsal
mechanism closing the mouth. As mentioned, however, the ventral mechanism remains simple and primitive in
Psettodes and the third group. On comparing these with the common Flat-fishes, we
find that the shape of the mouth is different; the mandibular rami have a more
horizontal slope, as in the normal Teleost, so that the line of action of the geniohyoid
muscle passes below the articulation of the lower jaw with the quadrate (fig. 95) ;
in the common Flat-fishes the mouth is more vertical than horizontal (fig. 75),
