donable if I digress for a moment, and remark, that the foregoing
researches ought to lead us on to others. May not the chemical
properties of the prismatic colours be as different as those which
relate to light and heat? Adequate methods for an investigation

of them may easily be found; and we cannot too minutely
enter into an analysis of light, which is the most subtle of all
the active principles that are concerned in the mechanism of
the operations of nature. A better acquaintance with it may
enable us to account for various facts that fall under our daily
observation, but which have hitherto remained unexplained. If
the power of heating, as we now see, be chiefly lodged in the
red-making rays, it accounts for the comfortable warmth that
is thrown out from a fire, when it is in the state of a red glow ;
and for the heat which is given by charcoal, coke, and balls of
small-coal mixed up with clay, used in hot-houses ; all which,
it is well known, throw out red light. It also explains the
reason why the yellow, green, blue, and purple flames of burn-
ing spirits mixed with salt, occasion $0 little heat that a hand
is not materially injured, when passed through their corusca-
tions. If the chemical properties of colours also, when ascer-
tained, should be such that an acid principle, for instance, which
