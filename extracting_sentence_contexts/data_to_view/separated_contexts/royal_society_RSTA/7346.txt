The above analysis expresses all the two-electron integrals required for atoms
in terms of integrals of the radial factors of the single-electron functions and in terms of the
Q coefficients. The Q coefficients are defined in terms of other quantities, but since only
comparatively few are required, these will be tabulated and used as numerical data. The
wisdom of this is illustrated by the fact that for extensive calculations on atomic states, up
to those of 3p shell, only fifty such coefficients have been used. No general formula for the
radial integrals can be given, since these might involve very different types of functions in
different applications. However, for the case of the polynomial exponential functions
which are used in the accompanying numerical investigations general formulas can be
obtained and have been given in part II.
