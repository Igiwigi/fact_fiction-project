This is confirmed by the analyses of BuckNER, Martin, and Perer (1925),
who obtained an average figure of 0-44°%, CaO in the isthmus and 0-24% CaO
in the uterus of the “ heavy laying hen.’’ Unfortunately their figures do not include
the calcium content of the uterus, when it contains a partly calcified shell, in com-
parison with material not in full secretory activity, though their analyses indicate
a reduction to 0- 18%, in the resting, partly atrophied organ. With these facts in mind, the special granules in the apical ciliated cells, revealed
in incinerated and stained preparations, fig. 25, Plate 18, and gu, figs. 28 and 29, Plate
19, cannot conclusively be regarded as the pro-secretion phases of calcium secretion
in the uterus.
