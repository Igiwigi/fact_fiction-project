The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 summarizes the experimental
and simulation behaviour seen when seeking optimal controls in the domain of quantum
phenomena, chemistry and material science, and natural evolution. Importantly, this evidence
stands as a body of empirical facts on the favourable structure of landscapes that demands an
explanation, which we claim has a common foundation. Section 3 focuses on that explanation


in quantum control, wherein detailed and exacting mathematical models exist. Section 4 starts
with a brief summary of the situation in chemistry and material science, as well as evolution,
and the reader will be referred to the literature for specific details of these analyses.
