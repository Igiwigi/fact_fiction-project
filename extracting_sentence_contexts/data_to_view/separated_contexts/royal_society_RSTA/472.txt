E,, according to our thermochemical measurements, should be rather more than 90 kcal. In consequence, if the suggested pyrolysis mechanism is correct, the apparent activation
energy should be about 60 kcal., which is not in good agreement with experiment. However, the reaction mechanism is not completely clear, and that it may need modifica-
tion is also suggested by two other facts. First, the addition of hydrogen decreases the
rate of pyrolysis and also decreases the apparent activation energy, the opposite effects to
those expected. Secondly, in several of the experiments, the ratio of methane formed to
aluminium trimethyl consumed was found to be considerably greater than that theoretically
possible on the basis of a dimeric vapour.
