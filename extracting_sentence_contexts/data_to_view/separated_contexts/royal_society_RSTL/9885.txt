ASSOCIATION UNIT OF RESISTANCE IN ABSOLUTE MEASURE. 687

The same method of measurement was applied at the beginning of the third set, and
a watch was kept by means of the measuring rods already spoken of (p. 667). Slight
movements were in fact observed, principally of the nature of a recovery of the
telescope stand from the rather violent treatment to which it had been 8ubjected as a
test. Minute corrections are accordingly introduced into the tabular statement
(p. 693), 80 as to make the rezults of different days comparable. At the close of the
spinnings the direct measurement was repeated, when there appeared a slight dis-
crepancy between the results obtained by Mrs. Srpawick and myself.
