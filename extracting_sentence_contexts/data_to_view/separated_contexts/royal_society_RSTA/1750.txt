Figure 6 shows the fractional laser absorption. It is clear that the simulated absorption is
typically just outside of the error of the experimental absorption, giving a slightly lower value. This could be improved by increasing the value of the CBET multiplier, but given the reasonable
agreement between the two (and the fact that high accuracy is not expected or required from this
1D code) it was decided that this constituted an acceptable level of agreement. Figure 7 shows
the simulated DT and TT yields, normalized to the experimental data, for each of the 10 shots. The normalized DT yield has a mean of 1.14 and varies between approximately 0.7 and 1.7, while
the normalized TT yield has a mean of 0.76 and varies between approximately 0.4 and 1.2.
