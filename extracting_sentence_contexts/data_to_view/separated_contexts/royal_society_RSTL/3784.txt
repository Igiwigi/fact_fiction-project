But (it may be contended) this arrangement, which is comprehensible for the gland,
is not equally s0 for the gill ; why should this organ, which, in regard of structure at
least, is clearly branchial, derive its 8upply of blood from a stream no longer requiring
aGration ? It cannot assist the respiratory process, which is already accomplished for
the blood arriving there : it cannot do more than maintain the previous oxygenisation
of the fluid which traverses it. I can conceive no other theory for the supplemental
gill, in agreement with the preceding facts, than one which interprets it as a diver-
ticular appendage to the first branchial vein, and contemplates its uses in reference
to the parts supplied by that vessel. Such then is the organ which,—obtaining the same nutritive supply as the thyroid
gland, and occupying a correspondent position,—found only where that gland is
absent, absent only where i is found, —may fitly be considered as its partial and
rudimentary representative*. The general results of the preceding inquiry are as follows; viz.
