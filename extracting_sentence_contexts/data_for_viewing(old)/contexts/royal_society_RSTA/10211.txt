which might be expected to obtain between m(7+72) and 7 for dilute solutions, does
in fact approximately persist up to normal solutions.

(b) References to Previous Theories.—The results obtained in the last section
suggest considerations which may tend to a great simplification of our ideas in
reference to the internal friction of fluids. Hitherto, very diverse theories have been
advanced in order to account for the apparent anomalies in the viscosity of liquids,
and various general formule have been proposed in order to express the experimental

facts. ARRHENIUS proposed a formula of the form » = 0” (‘ Zeit. f. Phys. Chem.,’ 1,
285, 1887) to express the viscosity of a solution in terms of the concentration. For
a mixture he proposed » = O,"C,"C,”..... This formula in the case of KCl, where the
constants for the two ions could be taken as approximately equal, reduced to the form
7 =C,™C,™. In this form Euuer (‘Zeit. f. Phys. Chem.,’ 25, 536, 1898) further
investigated the matter. Neither of these formule turned out to be of general
validity.

Grinersen* (‘Wiss Abh. der Phys.-Tech. Reichsanstalt,’ 4, 239, 1905) has
elaborated a very accurate formula which takes the form

7h = Aat+B(1—a) +Cm,
