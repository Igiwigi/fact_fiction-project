It was found
that heterogeneous HF stimuli may be a more useful driving strategy in weak signal detection
and transmission through layers. More precisely, distributed amplitudes of HF signal within the
population result in energetically efficient successful communication between neuronal layers
due to enabling correlated firing activity of interacting neurons. In another work, considering the fact that spike transmission between neuronal units is
actually unreliable due to the stochastic release of neurotransmitters [84], Xue et al. examined
the effects of unreliable synapses on signal propagation in the network and VR performance [85]. It was shown that successful spike transmission probability and excitatory coupling strength are
two critical factors effecting signal transmission, and that fine-tuning of these parameters can
provide higher VR performance for FFN via a stable signal propagation. It was also demonstrated
that the unreliable synaptic coupling scenario based on probabilistic neurotransmitter release is
