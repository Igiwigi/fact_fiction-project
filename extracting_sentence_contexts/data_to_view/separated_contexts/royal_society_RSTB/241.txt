So singular is
its relation to the bones behind that it is more like a post-cranial ossification than a
constituent element of the base of the skull, abutting against the concave surface of
the bones behind by a well-marked suture, which is posterior in position to the hinder
limit of the skull, while it overlaps those bones laterally and inferiorly, where it is
limited by a deep and characteristic infra-condylar depression. There is a doubtful
indication of a vertical suture or groove dividing the bones against which the basi-
occipital abuts. The fact that the superior margins of these bones appear to rise and
form the lateral boundaries of the foramen magnum leads me to identify them as the
ex-occipital bones. There is nothing unusual in the inferior median union of the

ex-occipital bones in South African Reptiles. The tripartite condition of the occipital
condyle’is seen in many Dicynodont skulls in the British Museum ; as well as in the
skulls of Chelonians.* But in the Dicynodonts the basi-occipital has already been
received between the ex-occipital bones, so that they take part in forming the condyle,
though their extension downward to the base of the skull is not less marked than in
Pareiasaurus.
