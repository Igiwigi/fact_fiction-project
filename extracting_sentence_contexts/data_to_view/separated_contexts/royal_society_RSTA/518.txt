Further research is required to understand the relationship between
different possible decompositions.

(c) Future of heterotic computing

All of our examples in §4 consist of a substrate with interesting computational potential combined
with a classical control layer provided by a conventional digital computer. One potential
exception is in quantum computing with ancilla-mediated quantum gates (§7), although there
are classical controls of one form or another required for most versions of this model. In fact, it is
not clear that quantum computing without any classical component is possible if ‘whole system’
analysis is performed. Stepney et al. [38] have proposed a heterotic system combining optical, bacterial and chemical
computing as a proof-of-concept exploration of the very different time scales in these systems,
but with direct interfaces that do not require a classical computer to mediate. As we have sought to demonstrate with our examples and discussion, most of our current
computing is in fact heterotic.
