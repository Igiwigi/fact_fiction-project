with J, and is not very different from it, so that a slight variation of 0W/0, with J, might very
easily be interpreted, within the accuracy of the experiments, as a variation with J,. Again,
in the experiments on simple compression, the range of variation of J, is so much greater
than that of J, that any variation of 2W/dJ, with J, may be masked.

In principle, the experiments on large pure homogeneous deformations (§§2 to 4) are not
open to this ambiguity. In practice, however, the values of 9W/dJ, and dW/dJ, obtained from
them are so inaccurate, particularly at the lower values of J, and J,, that this theoretical
advantage is largely lost. However, even though this possible ambiguity in the form for
W must be admitted, it remains true that the various load-deformation relations considered
can be interpreted, within experimental error, in terms of a single form for W.

The fact that this form for Wis such that 0W/d1, is not zero represents a departure from the
prediction of the kinetic theory of rubber-like elasticity which leads (Treloar 1943) to the

expression w- Cll, —3), (19-2)

in which C is a constant. This raises the question of the molecular mechanism which gives
rise to the departure—a problem which will not be pursued here.

Much of the discussion of the individual experiments has been concentrated on the finer
details of the experimental results, with the effect that certain broad features may have been
obscured. For each type of deformation considered, the deforming forces are expressed in
terms of the amount of deformation by expressions which consist of the product of two factors.
