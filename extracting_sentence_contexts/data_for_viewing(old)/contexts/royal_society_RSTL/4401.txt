On this subject an important fact was ascertained during the large deflections
which occurred in September and October, namely, that spontaneous deflections of

precisely the same character as those described in the foregoing part of this paper,
were found to take place on the short telegraph from the Electric Telegraph office in
the Strand to the Nine Elms Station, the wires of which are laid underground in
tubes throughout their length.

Taking this fact in connection with those before mentioned, viz. that no deflection
is produced in a wire suspended throughout its length in the air, that no deflection
is produced with a wire having only one earth connection, but that in every case
deflections are exhibited in a wire having two earth connections, and that the direc-
tion of the current in the wire at any given time is dependent on the relative positions
of the earth connections, the most probable explanation appears to be that the cur-
rents are terrestrial, of which a portion is conveyed along the wire, and rendered
visible by the multiplying action of the coil of the galyanometer.
