Owing to its low solubility and high mobility, the effects of hydrogen in solution on the
mechanical behaviour of titanium and zirconium alloys have been less studied. Nevertheless,
some points are now well established. Tensile tests performed on zirconium alloys in the range of
250—-400°C highlight the fact that the hydrogen content leads to a stress softening that depends
strongly on the oxygen content (figure 1). Additionally, an increase in creep velocities has
also been observed [14,44,45]. Using the relaxation tests for the same alloys, it was found that
hydrogen increases the activation volume for moderate oxygen content (0.31% in equivalent
oxygen content Oeq).
