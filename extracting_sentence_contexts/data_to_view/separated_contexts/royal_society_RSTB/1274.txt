This
is true of the older parts of the colony where active growth has ceased. Since the publication of Mosetxy’s paper the mesodermie, or, as I should prefy
call it, the mesogleal nature of the skeleton, has not been called into questi
excepting by G. von Kocn, who, in the introductory chapter to his work on {
Gorgonide (8) suggests, with his usual acumen, that the skeleton of Heliopora
probably be ectodermic. I have succeeded in proving that this is, in fact, the ¢

taken from the growing tip of a frond, is represented diagrammatically in fig,
and a portion of the same section, more highly magnified, is given in fig. 4 (Plate 10
Many of the histological features have already been accurately described by Moseum
but as he appears to have overlooked the origin and significance of the calicob
it will be necessary for me to recapitulate.
