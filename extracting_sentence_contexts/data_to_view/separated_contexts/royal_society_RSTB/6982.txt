The existence of the scutal valve
and the arrangements of its flap, show conclusively that blood must pass into the lateral
vessel. If blood passes into a vessel, except in the case of erectile tissue (see later, p. 125),
it is obvious that it must also have a way out. Now, since the lateral vessel divides up and
appears to end blindly among the gut parenchyma cells it follows that this parenchyma
must be in fact permeable to the blood. How the blood actually passes through the parenchyma it is impossible to say. One
thing that is certain is that there is no capillary system joining the ends of the branches of
the subintestinal vessel with the small vessels that open into the epineural sinus (see p. 116).
