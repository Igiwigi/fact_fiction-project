experimental conditions as in nature, and (ii) that the reduction of the interstitial
tissue may occur without any change in the germ cells.

In experiments Operations Nos. 22, 28, 29 and 30, the fish were subjected to a rising
temperature after the operation, rising at a rate of 5° C. per week to 27°C. After two
months, the testis remaining in the fish showed marked differences from that removed
by the operation. In addition to a well-developed interstitial tissue, which was accom-
panied by the appearance of the secondary sexual characters, the tubules showed a
fresh spermatogenesis, which had resulted in the distention of the anterior tubules
particularly. So great was this distention that in some cases the normal limits of the
testis had been burst through and small outpushings occurred. The fresh spermato-
genesis was interesting in that the tubules had, as a result, the appearance of a permanent
germinal epithelium ; in fact, that had the appearance which is found in animals with
a continuous spermatogenesis, such as mammals (Plate 22, fig. 17).

By comparison with Experiment VIII (p. 245), there can be little doubt that this
fresh spermatogenesis, which occurred while the tubules were already distended by
pre-existing spermatozoa, resulted from the exposure to high temperatures.

The occurrence of spermatogenesis in these fish was accompanied by the well-developed
interstitial tissue and the secondary sexual modifications. It is clear therefore that
the growth phase of the spermatocyte may be independent of the reduction of the
