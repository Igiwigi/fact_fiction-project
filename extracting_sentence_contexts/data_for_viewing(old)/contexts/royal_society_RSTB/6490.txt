The form of the faeces recalls that of the faecal mass of Patella described by GRAHAM
(1932), where the faecal particles are welded into a central consistent rod surrounded
by peripheral layers of cement. The similarity is correlated with a similar need on the
part of both animals.

In Patella, which remains attached to rocks for long periods, it is important that no
disintegration of faeces occurs in the vicinity of the anus, resulting in fouling of the
mantle cavity (GRAHAM 1932).

In Jorunna, where the anus lies within the circlet of branchiae, it is equally essential
that no disintegration of faeces occurs.

The fact that the mechanism for the preparation of faeces in Jorunna has not the
complexity of that of Patella, where the whole of the elaborate midgut appears to be
largely concerned with preparation of faeces, is possibly correlated with a different
mode of life. Jorunna is comparatively active, and slight disintegration of the faeces
would be of no consequence, since the naked gills are continually bathed by currents
of clean water; and the movement of the animal will tend to shake off any loose
faecal masses that may remain clinging to the gills. Patella, on the other hand, remains
in one situation for considerable periods, and thus the chances of fouling of the
mantle are considerably greater, hence the more elaborate mechanism for preparation
of the faeces.
