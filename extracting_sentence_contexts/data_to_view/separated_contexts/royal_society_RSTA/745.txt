The demands required by the larger environmental impact-reduction measures however did tend
to confirm the somewhat apologetic title, and a range of difficult questions about material demand
went under- or unexplored (including rebound effects of financial savings, or complexities of
environmental impacts of reuse [32,33]). The long-running (since 1999) Channel 4 home-building series Grand Designs was also offered
by several media decision-makers as an example of sustainability thinking, again set within the
idiom of aspirational lifestyle television. However, this aspirational specialist factual programme
carries more content about consuming ‘well’ than less. Perhaps in acknowledgement of this, the
on-screen talent Kevin McCloud has also presented series and one-off shows devised around or
linked to material demand reduction, including Kevin McCloud’s Man Made Home (Channel 4,
2012 and 2013) and Kevin's Supersized Salvage (Channel 4, 2014) that several interviewees offered
as examples of taking sustainability into the heart of mainstream television schedules. There is also evidence of the importance of entrepreneurship by programme makers and their
presenters and advisors, in other words of taking financial or creative risks in order to present
important but ‘difficult’, ‘invisible’ or abstract issues in new ways.
