Das 11 ;- Dec. 1305-1 122

An examination of this Table will show that nearly half of the great changes began
when the Sth meridian after the zero had passed, while five began near the 12th after,
and five near the zero itself. The two greatest changes of magnetic force in 1844
happened near the + 8 meridian, and the two greatest in 1845 at the 0 meridian *.

* Knurr, who obtained 80 many interesting results, has noticed the fact that great disturbances occurred
frequently on the same, or nearly the same, day of 'snccessive years. © Thus the greatest disturbances which
took place in the year 1836 were on the 22nd and 23rd April and on the 18th October, and both these were
repeated on the same days in 1837,” In 1838 geveral disturbances occurred within a few days of the same dates
of 1837, a list of which he gives. Ho also draws attention to the fact of © the symmetrical urrangement of these
disturbances in the same year, many of them being nearly six months apart” (Phil. Mag. 1840, vol. xvi. p. 246). It has been pointed out that 14 solar rotations are performed in 364 days, or within one day of the year ; there
are also 7 rotations in 8ix months.
