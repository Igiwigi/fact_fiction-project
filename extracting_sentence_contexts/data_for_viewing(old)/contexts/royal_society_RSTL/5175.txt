in the phosphatic acid, the former being produced during the oxidation which phos-
phorus undergoes in moist atmospheric air.

I have further ascertained that hydrate of lime, being suspended in water and 8uf-
ficiently long treated with ozonized air, produces a salt exhibiting the properties of a
nitrate.

M. FseLLexnBERG has published* results which lead also to the conclusion, that
either nitrites or nitrates are formed in treating hydrate of lime with ozonized atmo-
spheric air, and the same chemist has made observations with the phosphatic acid
coinciding with the results I have obtained from my own experiments. The philo-
sopher of Lansanne is rather inclined to identify ozone with hyponitric acid. I think,
however, that such an opinion cannot be upheld, and is contrary to facts, of which I
gave an account in Poc@enDoRFF's Annals some time ago. According to my expe-
riments, 0zone destroys instantaneously hyponitric acid, hydrate of nitric acid being
formed. Phosphorus does not shine in atmospheric air containing the smallest
quantity of hyponitric acid, whilst phosphorus exhibits a very lively disengagement
of light when placed in atmospheric air, being ever s0 strongly charged with ozone.
Blue litmus paper being suspended in air of the latter description is not in the least
reddened, but simply and rapidly bleached ; whilst the same paper placed in atmo-
spheric air, which is only slightly charged with hyponitric acid, assumes a perceptibly
red colour. Ozonized air being charged with yapour of ammonia or carbonate of
ammonia 80 strongly as to bring back instantly the blue colour of reddened litmus
paper, enjoys the property of decomposing iodide of potassium (i. e. colouring blue
the parts of starch mixed with that iodide), transforming the yellow prussiate into
