Now suppose the charge exploded in the chamber to be increased. In this case, not
only is the density of the permanent gases increased on account of a larger quantity being
generated, but the density is still further added to, from the gases being confined in a
smaller space; the liquid residue CD H G being increased in a like proportion with the

- haye of course assumed that the temperature, whatever be the value of 3, is the same.
= In onr experiments the charges exploded have yaried in quantity from that necessary
3 to fill entirely the chamber to a 8mall fraction of that quantity; but whatever the charge
5 it is obvious that if the yessel be considered imperyious to heat (and we have already
2 pointed out that only with the lower charges is there a material error due to this hypo-
Z thesis), the temperature at the moment of explosion would be the same ; for, as in the
=) case of Jovn's celebrated experiment, any heat converted into work by the expansion
