to serve valuable ecological processes, the details of how a
given community can adapt itself to achieve and maintain
such a condition will vary widely depending on the charac-
teristics of the community itself (including their relationship
to the landscape). While this is being increasingly recognized,
it is not well articulated in terms of the strategies for achiev-
ing FACs or potential outcomes that guide that goal. That is,
the science of wildfire has spent comparably less time
attempting to understand the factors that will allow for flex-
ible application of wildfire mitigation policies, programmes
and planning for a variety of communities [36,37].

Given our above argument, one critical place to make pro-
gress on the ‘fire problem’ is at the community level—yet
WUI or peri-urban communities are diverse and complex.
Thus, it follows that a systematic understanding of the key
characteristics that differentially influence community adap-
tation to fire risk is needed [36,37]. The documentation of
these key characteristics across communities can help pro-
