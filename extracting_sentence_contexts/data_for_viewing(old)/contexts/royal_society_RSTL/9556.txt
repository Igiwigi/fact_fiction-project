a layer of small pyramidal elements immediately above the ganglionic group.

Transition realms.â€”-Every intermediate state is clearly discernible betwixt these two
types of lamination in neighbourhoods where they approach each other and blend. Thus,
in studying the passage of a five- into a six-laminated region, we meet with territories
where the five-laminated cortex presents us with very small ganglionic cells still arranged
in nests, and forming but pigmy representatives of those larger groups believed to be

characteristic of motor areas. Again, we come upon regions where a nested arrange-
ment of small ganglionic cells is associated with a gix-laminated cortex. In fact, the
nested arrangement and size of the individual cells appear to be invariably in inverse
ratio to the depth of the small angular formation superimposed, 80 that, as we approach
motor realms, the latter thins out and gradually disappears, whilst the nests become
more and more perfect and embrace larger and still larger cells. On the other hand,
as we recede from motor regions the nests thin ont, become less perfect as groups,
include cells of small dimensions, become more widely separated from each other, whilst
the superimposed stratum gains in depth and increases in density by the close aggre-
gation of its angular and pyramidal elements. In studying the arrangement of the
layers of the cortex the above points appear to me to demand careful attention, and
the eye should become perfectly familiarised with the varied appearances presented
by transition zones of the cerebrum.
