It was, however, necessary to ascertain whether the mere fact of exposure to
such a low temperature produced any change in the micro-structure of the alloys, and
to test this point duplicate specimens of the alloys were immersed in liquid air for a
similar length of time, but the immersion in this case only took place after the
temperature of transformation had been passed ; specimens of pure lead and of pure
tin were included in this experiment. A third set of similar specimens was then
allowed to cool very slowly in the electric oven itself, and the micro-structure of the
three sets was subsequently compared. In the case of pure tin, the experiment was
tried in view of the fact that tin is known to exist at low temperatures in the allo-
tropic form of a grey powder, and it was supposed that some sign of this phase might
be detected in the specimen cooled in liquid air; this was not the case, however, and

the conclusion is justified that the duration of the exposure to liquid air was not long
enough to allow this transformation to occur. The comparison of the micro-structure of the specimens quenched from a tempe-
rature just below the recalescence in question with that of very slowly-cooled
specimens also shows only very slight differences, so that the conclusion is justified
that the differences observed between the structure of specimens quenched above the
recalescence temperature and those which have been allowed to undergo the change
unhindered are due entirely to the partial suppression of the transformation associated
with these evolutions of heat. The alloys chosen for close study in this respect were those containing 16 to 18 per
cent.
