N->o of the corresponding finite system of 3N equations in which the series (8), (9)
and (10) terminate at n= N—1, and the boundary conditions (3) and (4) are
satisfied only for N arbitrary values of the angular variable @ instead of for all values from
zero to 47.


PART III. COLLAPSE OF FLUID COLUMNS 295

We have already explained in § 2 that if the radius vector to the interface R is expanded
in terms of only the even harmonics, then for any finite expansion, the interface must meet
the ground vertically. On the other hand, it is not necessary in the numerical work to
expand R only in even harmonics, and then the interface will not in general be vertical at
the point where it meets the ground. Arguments can in fact be advanced to show that the
interface must ultimately make an angle of }7 with the ground. We are indebted to Professor
Harold Jeffreys for demonstrating this result and for permission to quote his argument.
A similar proof has already been given independently by von Karman (1940) in connexion
with ‘gravity currents’. Both Jeffreys’s and Karman’s proofs are reminiscent of Stokes’s
proof (1880) that the crest of the highest progressive finite plane gravity wave of permanent
form on deep water is a cusp of semi-angle 47. Professor Jeffreys’s proof is as follows.

ey Ficure 3. Steady-state motion at the base of the column. The point at which the column
touches the bottom is kept at rest by a mass motion of the whole system.
