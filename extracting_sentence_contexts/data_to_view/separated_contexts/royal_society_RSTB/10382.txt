To test
the boundary case of infants only having access to the MSP
(though they may have some limited use of the TSP), we ran
additional simulations with the TSP lesioned. We found that
learning and representations were essentially unchanged (elec-
tronic supplementary material, figure S2). In fact, pairmate
retrieval was slightly better without versus with the TSP (at
the end of training, mean A — B retrieval: 0.98 versus 0.94,
respectively, toog = 6.66, p < 0.001; mean B — A retrieval: 0.90
versus 0.87, toog = 2.49, p = 0.01). This stands in contrast to
the very detrimental effects of an MSP lesion (electronic sup-
plementary material, figure S1b), revealing that the MSP is
necessary and sufficient for statistical learning and providing
a possible explanation for intact rapid statistical learning in
infants despite protracted hippocampal development.

(b) Higher level learning

The structure of the sequences considered so far was simple—it
could be learned by tracking the strength of transition probabil-
ities between adjacent items or the joint frequencies of pairs. To examine how the MSP handles higher level, more complex
statistics, we simulated learning of a ‘community structure’
sequence that cannot be parsed based on transition probability
or joint frequency [5,19].
