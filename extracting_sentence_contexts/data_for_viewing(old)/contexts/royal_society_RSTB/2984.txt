Plate 4, phots. 1 and 4 and Plate 10, fig. 34), At this stage the cupule far overtopped
the seed, and no doubt completely enclosed it. In the youngest specimen (fig. 34) a
lobe of the cupule even extends to double the height of the ovule, but here some dis-
placement may have occurred. At maturity the enclosure of the seed was no doubt
less complete. The transverse section W. 1915, M. (Plate 7, fig. 1) shows that even
in the mature condition the cupule still reached to near the apex, but at this stage it

was in all probability open at the top, as shown by the fact that most of the seeds
found had freed themselves from it altogether.

The seed was borne terminally on a pedicel, as seen in the longitudinal section 8, 558
(Plate 5, phot. 15 and Plate 10, fig. 33), the only case in which the connection is shown
ina mature specimen; the seed, though cut tangentially, measures 4°5 millims. in
length by 2°8 millims. in maximum width. The pedicel is shown for a length of
about 2 millims., but as it is incomplete below, no idea of its real length can be
formed. It is about *5 millim. in diameter. The cupule springs from the pedicel
at its upper end, immediately below the base of the seed, which it closely invests.
Tn cases where the investment is loose this may be due to accident or to the arrested
growth of the seed (Plate 4, phot. 1, from,W. 1931, A.). The cupule in its lower
