Figs. 2 & 3 give a graphical representation of these relations of chemical intensity as
ordinates to the sun's altitude as abscisse. The unbroken curye in fig. 2 shows the
Catania observations, the dotted curve those made at Tisbon. In fig. 3 the observations
of direct chemical intensity are represented by the broad lines, those made at Catania
being distinguished by the unbroken curve. In all cases the positions of the experi-
mentally determined points are given to show how closely they lie to the curves. In
both ecases it is evident that the relation between the solar altitude and the total chemical
intensity is represented by a straight line, although the Catania observations slightly
exceed by a constant difference those made at Moita, in conformity with the slight
difference in latitude, and with the fact that the former determinations were made at
a greater elevation above the sea-leyel.

The Catania observations further confirm the fact which we then announced, that for
altitudes below 50 the amount of chemical action effected by diffused daylight on a sur-
face placed in the plane of the horizon is greater than that exerted by direct radiation,
and also that at low altitudes (9* or 10?) direct sunlight is almost completely robbed of
its chemically active rays.
