The lateral
margin is free, but is connected with the lower end of the lateral part of the anterior
lateral by an area of skin containing a few large stellate tubercles. This ends abruptly
at an embayed edge, best shown in Brom! (19304, pl. III, fig. 1), apparently marking
a depression for the anterior corner of the pectoral fin, which is shown (P. 501) by the
fact that it can be displaced to have been free. It is evident that a space separated the
ventral border of the anterior lateral from the hinder part of the lateral border of
the interlateral, and allowed the fin skeleton and musculature to pass from the
primary shoulder girdle (of which no trace is preserved) to the fin itself. Comparison
of this description, and fig. 25 illustrating it, with the shoulder girdle of a Ptyctodont
will show that in principle and indeed in many details the two agree.
