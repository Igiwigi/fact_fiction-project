In the first place, we may state that we were most serupulonsly careful about the
cleanliness of the apparatus, It was always taken to pieces as 800n as the experi-
ments were over, and the glass box, rings, tubes, linen bands, &ec., were all washed in
distilled water. The bands were left to soak all night, and when required were wrung
out and dried with blotting paper. The films were always flooded before an experi-
ment began, 80 that the cups and bands were well washed down with the solution.
We found also that snecessive films, when thus treated, behaved in a much more
uniform way than if the flooding was omitted, We have at times replaced the metal L
rings by the glass ones, and been most careful that the liquid shonld touch nothing
but glass and linen, but the phenomenon above described was as marked as before.
Lastly, if one of the films was thickened by the electric current it contracted just as
i would do if thickened by flooding. The fact thab the thicker film displayed the
greater surface tension cannot, therefore, be due to any peculiarity: of the apparatus
or mode of thickening adopted.

Experiment TIT.

As a crucial test as to whether the weight of the thicker film had anything to do
with the phenomenon, we placed the larger rings on the upper and the smaller rings
on the lower supports. We thus obtained two unduloidal films, which may be
described as approximately cones with the smaller ends below. It is evident that if
one of these films were heavier than the other the pressure exerted on the enclosed air
would thereby be diminished, and the heavier film would bulge. Experiment proved
that, on the contrary, it contracted, thus indicating that the pressure was increased,
