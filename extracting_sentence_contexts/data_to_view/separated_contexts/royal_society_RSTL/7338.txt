When viewed
from that distance, the light was a very magnificent object to behold, the rays proceeding
from the reflector having all the rich effulgence of sunshine.

80. A piece of the ordinary sensitized paper, such as is used for photographic printing,
when exposed to the action of the light for twenty seconds, at a distance of 2 feet from
the reflector, was darkened to the same degree as was a piece of the same sheet of paper
when exposed for a period of one minute to the direct rays of the sun, at noon, on a very
clear day in the month of March.

81. The extraordinary calorific and illuminating powers of the 10-inch machine are
all the more remarkable from the fact that they have their origin in six small perma-
nent magnets, weighing only 11b. each (12), and only capable, at most, of sustaining
collectively a weight of 60 Ibs. ; while the electricity from the magneto-electric machine
which was employed in exciting the electro-magnet was, of itself, incapable of heating
to redness the shortest length of iron wire of the smallest size manufactured.

82. The production of s0 large an amount of electricity was only obtained (as might
have been anticipated by the physicist) by a correspondingly large expenditure of mecha-
nical force, as the machine when in full action absorbed, as nearly as could be estimated,
from eight to ten horse-power. When the 24-inch magneto-electric machine (58) was
substituted- for the 18-inch machine, in the combination before described (76), the
magnetism deyeloped in the electro-magnet of the 10-inch machine was exalted to such
a degree that, although the strong leather belt from the main shaft, used for driving the
: countershaft, was 6 inches in width and acted upon a pulley 10 inches in diameter, it was
scarcely able to drive the machine.
