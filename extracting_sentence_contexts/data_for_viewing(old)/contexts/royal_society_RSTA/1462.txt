to the machine-learning community, these problems are typically swept under the carpet by the
most ardent BD aficionados.

5. The two distant sisters: correlation and causation

The fact that correlation does not imply causation is such a well-known topic that we only
mention it for completeness.

It is indeed well recognized that even if two signals manage to register a very high correlation
coefficient C (close to 1), this does not necessarily imply that they are mechanistically related.
They may be false correlations (FC), as opposed to true correlations (TC), the latter signalling a


true causal connection. The matter lends itself to hilarious observations: the rate of drowning by
falling in a pool appears tightly correlated with Nicolas Cage’s movies: unless one assumes that
Cage’s movies are so badly received as to induce some to drown themselves, there is little question
that this is an FC. This case is trivial, but the general problem is not: distinguishing between TC’s
and FC’s is an art, as the problem is both hard and important.
