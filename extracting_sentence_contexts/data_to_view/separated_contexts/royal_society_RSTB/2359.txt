This section corresponds very
nearly with one through the proximal region of Z. Lomawi, cut a little further out

features as the corresponding sections of L. Lomasi. A series of four sections from one “seed,” cut in parallel, nearly horizontal* planes,
is of interest, especially as this aspect has not been illustrated in the former species. Three of the sections are represented in figs.
