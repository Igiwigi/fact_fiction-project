On a submarine Forest, on the east Coast of England. By
Joseph Correa de Serra, LL.D. F.R.S. and A.S.

Read February 28, 1799. Is geology, more perhaps than in any other branch of natural
history, there exists a necessity of strictly separating the facts
observed from the ideas which, in order to explain them, may
occur to the mind of the observer. In the present state of this
science, every well ascertained fact increases our still narrow
stock of real knowledge; when, on the contrary, the reasonings
weare enabled to make, are at best but ingenious guesses, which
too often bias and mislead the judgment. I shall therefore en-
deayour, in this Paper, to give, first, a mere description of the
object, unmixed with any-systematical ideas, and shall after-
wards-offer such conjectures on its cause as seem to me to be
fairly grounded on observation.
