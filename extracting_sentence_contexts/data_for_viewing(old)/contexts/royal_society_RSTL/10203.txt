We now proceed to the study of the second, and much more important, of the two

- 8tatements made in our previous paper relating to the electromotive properties of the
resting leaf. The fact that the external surface of the lobe is positive to the internal
gurface opposite to it, we propose to designate by the term * eross difference,” which
sufficiently expresses its own meaning. It will be remembered that the existence of
any 8uch difference is denied by Professxor MUNK, who holds that the opposite
surfaces of the lobe are isoelectrical.

In a preliminary series of observations made in the Laboratory of the Royal Gardens
at the same time with those already referred to no exceptions were met with. No
importance, however, could be attached to the bare fact of the negativity of the
internal surface unless it could be shown to be physiological in its nature—that is, not
a result, of the merely chemical or physical differences of the two opposite surfaces of
contact. The method which is employed for determining whether a phenomenon is
physiological or not, must always be the same. Tt consists in observing whether its
development is 80 associated with the functions of the living part or organism in which
it has its 8eat as to indicate that it is dependent upon it or forms part of it. It, was
therefore the first step towards determining the physiological meaning of the cross
difference, to ascertain whether it is modified by changes in the vital activity of the
leaf, and particularly whether it is the same in unexcited and in excited leaves, and
