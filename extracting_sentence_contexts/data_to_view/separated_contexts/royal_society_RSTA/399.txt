Direct
imaging observations also suffer from the lack of knowledge of the planetary radius and
sometimes mass. When the mass and the radius are not known, model estimates need to
be invoked, increasing the source of degeneracy.

. Accurate linelists are an essential element of radiative transfer models, and this fact is not
always appreciated. As a result, the abundances for molecular species are often derived
with linelists that are incomplete or extrapolated from measurements/calculations at
low temperatures. This issue—especially together with point 3—may introduce large
errors.
