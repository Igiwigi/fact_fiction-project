during the initial emerging phase of an AR, emerging flux alone has the necessary energy to : 2

(a) Observational examples

An observational survey of eruptions [24] reported that for most of the eruptions studied there : S
was new flux emerging at the close neighbourhood of a filament. They found that flux emergence : =
started a few days before the ejective eruption of the filament, which indicates that the interaction : a
between the emerging field and the pre-existing magnetic field of (or enveloping) the filament : =
triggered the eruption. In fact, it was reported that the orientation between the two interacting : =
magnetic flux systems was such that efficient reconnection between them occurred, leading to the [3
onset of a CME. Moreover, it was found that eruptions were not observed in most of the cases : =
where flux emergence did not occur nearby the filament. The authors stated that these results are 8
indicative but not conclusive of whether flux emergence is a necessary condition for the onset of : o
eruptions. is

Another observational study [26] presented a statistical survey, comprising newly emerging : =
and well-developed ARs and CME-source regions, towards understanding the relationship : 3
between surface magnetic field variation and CME initiation. By measuring the total magnetic oS

flux and the flux variation rate, it was found that magnetic flux increases (decreases) before the
CME initiation in 60 (40)% of the CME-source regions. Also, small-scale magnetic flux emergence
