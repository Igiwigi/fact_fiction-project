But, in recent years there has been an unprecedented surge in the range of tools available to measure activity in
the brain. These techniques range from the invasive, with their incumbent problems, to the entirely non-invasive,
which can be used on human volunteers. The multitude of different techniques reflects the fact that each have their
own particular advantages. All methods also have their limitations, be they of convenience, expense, invasivene
accuracy, sensitivity, and spatial and temporal resolution. Brain imaging methods, which simultaneously localize multiple signal sources, have perhaps the highest profile of
all the techniques which are used to measure brain activity.
