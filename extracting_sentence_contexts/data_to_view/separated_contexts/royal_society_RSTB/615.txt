“This experiment is one of the two made by GALEN ; but he seems not to have looked
at all at the condition of sensibility, and he simply states that there is a paralysis on
the side of the section, and no paralysis on the opposite side. “Sir Astiey Cooper, under the suggestion of Dr. YELLOwLy, has made a similar
experiment, except that the section was higher; the state of sensibility is not men-
tioned, and, as regards movement, there was paralysis on the side operated upon. “‘Scnorps, VAN Deen, and STituine have observed that sensibility is not lost in the
limb or limbs behind, and on the side of the section of the lateral half of the spinal
cord; but they have not remarked the most important fact, that on the opposite side
there is anesthesia. They also do not mention this curious result of this experiment,
the existence of hyperesthesia on the side of the injury. [May not this have been because these observers did not find any facts to warrant
the inference of hypereesthesia on the same side, and anesthesia of the opposite ?—

“ FopERA was very near discovering that there is a decussation of the sensitive fibres
in the spinal cord.
