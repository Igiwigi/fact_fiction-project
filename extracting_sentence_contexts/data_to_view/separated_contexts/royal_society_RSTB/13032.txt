According to the influential ‘dual memories’ theory, novel
memories are first acquired by the hippocampus (whose con-
nectivity affords rapid, one-shot learning) and successively
transferred to and consolidated in the cortex (where learning
is slower)—with SWR sequences possibly playing a key role
in such memory consolidation process [134]. The general idea
is that (episodic) hippocampal memories are ‘replayed’ mul-
tiple times, especially overnight, and the replays essentially
‘train’ the cortex to form its (semantic) memories. Supporting
this view is the fact that interrupting replays interferes with
memory consolidation [135,136]. Note that similar ‘experience
replay’ and ‘generative replay’ methods are widely used
in machine learning to improve the robustness of neural
networks during training [122,137,138]. Recent studies are
increasingly showing that the interplay between hippocampal
and cortical networks may be more sophisticated and
bidirectional than previously believed, hence permitting the
reciprocal shaping of episodic and semantic memories
during consolidation [113,139].
