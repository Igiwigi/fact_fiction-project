Tu locality of this mineral, and the singularity of its ex-
ternal characters, having excited my curiosity, I. took adyan-
tage of the facilities furnished by the liberality of the Royal
Society of Dublin, of which I have, the. honour of. being. one
of the Vice Presidents, to. make the subjoined analysis in their
laboratory.

Doctor FiTToy, in an.excellent paper inserted in the first
volume of the Transactions,'of the. Geological Society, has
given a minute description of the site. and external characters
of the Newry pitch-stone. I shall transcribe. it, previous to
laying before the,-Royal Society. my. own. observations. I do
s0 with, more. satisfaction,-as we, in, general agree; in fact,
scarcely two. specimens are. exactly the same, although con-
tiguous to. each other in the vein ; some being compact, some
thin\slaty, some olive, and some leek-green ; some $0: disin-
tegrated, particularly when exposed to the air, as to be friable
between the fingers, while others retain, their gloss, consis=-
tency, and colour, with much tenacity, although they all fall
at length into rhomboidal fragments. I may add also, that
while some are quite porphyritic, others have but a few specks
of felspar on their surface,
