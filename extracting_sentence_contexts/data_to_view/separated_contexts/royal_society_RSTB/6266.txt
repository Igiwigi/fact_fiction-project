9—The Golgi Apparatus and other Cytoplasmic Phenomena in the Ciliated Oviducal Epithelium

An examination of silver and osmium impregnations of the uterine epithelium,
in particular, has been made in view of BRAMBELL’s contention (1925) that secretory
processes in the columnar cells possibly involve the extrusion of Golgi material from
the apical cell cytoplasm, followed by its reformation in the basal cells. It has been
impossible to confirm this phenomenon in the present material, which includes a
large series of preparations, representing the entire secretory cycle in the uterus and
isthmus. Bowen (1926) in his discussion on the Golgi apparatus in gland tissues,
refers, in a footnote, to the lack of thorough and critical evidence supporting the
origin of the Golgi apparatus de novo, and points out that BRAMBELL’s observations
are at variance with well-established facts in other secretory cells. VOL. CCXXV.—B 2A

In the first place, BRAMBELL assumes that all the epithelial cells are ciliated and
similar in type throughout the uterine secretory cycle.
