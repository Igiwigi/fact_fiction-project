have expected there to be clear ‘over and out’ signals of the
kind used on two-way radios—instead, the ends of turns are
judged by a complex and distributed set of features [11]. Or,
given the multimodal nature of that niche, one might have
expected an elaborate syntax that could freely embed non-
vocal signals sequentially along with vocal ones. This occurs
only to a limited extent, as in ‘The two cars went [claps
