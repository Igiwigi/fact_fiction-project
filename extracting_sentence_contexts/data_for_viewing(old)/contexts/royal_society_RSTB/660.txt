paper. All the facts that have been recently accumulated seem to me to point to
R. radiata being one of the most primitive members of the Skate group. If this is
established, it will support the view that the electric organ of Skates does not belong
to vestigial structures. In discussing the place of R. radiata in the phylogeny of its
group, various questions require consideration. From what we know of the ancestral
history of Mammals, Birds, and Reptiles, it seems probable that the smaller (dwarfed
and degraded forms excepted) rather than the larger species of any given genus are
most likely to present ancestral characters. In the case of the Skate genus, the pro-
bability is that the smaller species (¢.g., R. radiata or R. circularis) found in our
waters more closely resemble the ancestral forms than the large FR. batis or R. alba.
In other words, it is more likely that the Skates have sprung from small generalized
Selachians than from extinct forms as large, e.g., as Lemargus, which implies that
R. batis, and other still larger species, do not owe their great size to the fact that
they are large Sharks flattened out, but rather that they are Skate whose ancestors
have continued to produce large varieties, which have best succeeded in the struggle
for existence. If this is the case, if the ancestors of the Skates were comparatively
small forms, it will, it appears to me, be impossible to account for the existence of the
electric organ by looking upon it as a vestige of a large useful ancestral structure—a
view which neither seems to be warranted by the developmental history nor the
behaviour after development. From an embryological standpoint, P. radiata appears »
to be in various aspects more Shark-like than either 2. batis or R. clavata.t Further,
according to the observations of Howes, recently communicated to the Zoological
Society,} A. radiata is, in structural points, more primitive than other Skate. It
appears that there is a continual increase in the mesopterygeal area of the skeleton of
the pectoral fin as one passes from the Rhinobatide through the Raiade to the
