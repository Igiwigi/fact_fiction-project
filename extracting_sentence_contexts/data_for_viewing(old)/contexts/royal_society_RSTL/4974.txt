much the most frequent occurrence when the ova are placed in dense fluid before
contact with the spermatozoa, as in the experiments with carmine. Lastly, when the
ova are only partially impregnated 'they are usually, and perhaps always unpro-
ductive.

These facts lead us to inquire, whether impregnation takes place through any cata-
Iytic influence of the spermatozoa as suggested by BiscnorFe®, while in a state of
activity, and at the instant they are brought into contact with the ovum, or whether
impregnation results from a difluence of the spermatozoa thus brought into contact
with the surface, the substance into which they may be dissolved being carried by
endosmosis with the water imbibed through the tissues ; or whether it is the result

X of the conjoint influence of both these conditions ;—the first action induced being
8 instantaneous and catalytic, and possibly dependent on the persistence of organic
5 vitality in the spermatozoa, while the completion of the impregnation may depend on
- the imbibition of some material influence or substance derived from the impregnating

Hfrom the surface of the ovum, both in the Frog and Newt, seems to favour; as we
