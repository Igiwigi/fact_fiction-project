It will be seen that for the ascents of May 8rd, August 2nd, and August 4th,
when the wind force was about 3, the values of $(##d) are 8°4 x 10°, 2°5 x 10°, 2°6 x 10*

and 3°4x 10°; and that for July 17th and July 29th, when the wind force was
about 2, the values were very much lower, being 0°57 x 10* and 1°3 x 10* respectively. The fact that these figures are so consistent, although ¢ varies from 11 hours to
7 days and z from 140 metres to 770 metres, seems to indicate that the eddy motion
does not diminish to any great extent in the first 770 metres above the surface. Vertical Change of Velocity due to Eddy Motion. In the first part of this paper the vertical transference of heat by means of eddies
has been discussed.
