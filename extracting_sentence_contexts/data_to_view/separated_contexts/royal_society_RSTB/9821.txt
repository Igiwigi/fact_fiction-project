Likewise, Basten et al. [5]
state that: ‘Fertility forecasting has been dominated by the para-
digm of the demographic transition. Fertility was thought to
fall from a high comparatively stable level to a low compara-
tively stable level. This transition was considered to be
irreversible, so once a low enough level of fertility was achieved
it would never increase.’ Furthermore, Lutz [6] states that:
‘In fact, the social sciences as a whole have yet to come up
with a useful theory to predict the future fertility level of
post-demographic transition societies. Forecasters can only
try to define a likely range of uncertainty. As the fertility tran-
sition is irreversible, we are quite sure that the fertility rate will
not go back to pre-transitional high levels. . .’.
