(3) Deep explanations: ‘the system answers the question by using the knowledge base of the

user, and not just that of the system [...] the explainer must base the explanation on its : S
understanding of what the explainee fails to understand’ [28, p. 73]. : =

This distinction, presumed to be mutually exclusive, originates in the development of software for : =
medical expert systems (whence it was retrieved by Douglas Walton, and applied to mathematics : =
by Michel Dufour, [29, p. 6]). Researchers found it useful to distinguish three types of knowledge 1B
required for ‘understanding physicians’ explanations of their reasoning, as well as being a :2
foundation for re-representing the knowledge’ [30, p. 221]. These three kinds, structural, strategic 8
and support knowledge, are distinct from the domain knowledge, such as facts about medicine. if
Structural knowledge indexes the domain knowledge into rules; strategic knowledge imposes a : x
plan of how to apply these rules, in pursuit of which goals, and in which order; and support : =
knowledge comprises the broader background which provides the justification for structural :3

and strategic knowledge. Hence, a request for an explanation could be construed as a request
for one of these three sorts of knowledge, which the system may meet by outputting a trace,
strategic or deep explanation, respectively [31, p. 174]. That is, each of the three comprises a
different contextual constraint on the relevance relation. By limiting that relation to independently
motivated instances, Kitcher & Salmon’s trivialization may be headed off. Indeed, van Fraassen’s
own discussion of relevance already draws distinctions that echo the trace/strategic/deep
distinction. For example, ‘asking for a sort of reason that at least includes events-leading-up-to’
is naturally construed as a request for a trace explanation, whereas asking for a ‘motive’ would
