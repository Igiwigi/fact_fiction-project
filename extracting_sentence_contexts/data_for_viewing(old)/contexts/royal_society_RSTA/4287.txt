qz,e(t) =95) for te [(j—1)t, jt. with j=1,...,J. and qre(T) = qj (2.3)

For ¢ = 0, one asks for existence of true minimizers, which in the present, non-relaxed case is not
to be expected in general.

The major task is now the characterization of all possible limits, ie. accumulation points, of
qz,< for (t, €) — (0,0) and to derive a suitable evolutionary model (e.g. in the sense of Mielke [27])
having these limits as solutions. In general, this task is still much too difficult; however, we will
see in §5 that it is solvable for the two-phase model (i.e. N = 2) with C; = Cp.

The main achievement in [7,8] was the observation of the general fact that all possible limits of
the above approximate incremental minimization problem lead to so-called energetic solutions for
rate-independent systems.

Definition 2.1 (Energetic solutions). A function q: [0,T]— Q is called an energetic solution of
the ERIS (9, €,D) if tr d;€(t, q(t) lies in L1((0, T]) and if for all t € [0, T] the stability (S) and the
energy balance (E) hold:

(S) E(t,q(t)) < E(t, 9) + D(q,q) for all ge Q,
t (2.4)

and (E) E(t,q(t)) + Diss (q, [0, #]) = E(0, q(0)) + I, d;E(s, q(s)) ds,
