There is no doubt that the ‘big data/machine learning /artificial intelligence’ (BD/ML/AI)
approach has plenty of scope to play a constructive and important role in addressing major
scientific problems. Among the applications, pattern recognition is particularly powerful in

detecting patterns which might otherwise remain hidden indefinitely (modulo the problem of
false positives mentioned earlier). Possibly the most important role is likely to be in establishing
patterns which then demand further explanation, where scientific theories are required to make
sense of what is discovered. We have written elsewhere [7] of the fact that rapid ‘successes’ of BD
approaches take far longer to turn into sources of scientific insight.

In passing, however, we cannot refrain from commenting on the resurgence of use of the term
‘artificial intelligence’ in this context, more than forty years after Marvin Minsky’s unfortunate
claim that computers were just a few years away from emulating human intelligence. That
wild claim led to a decades-long ‘AI winter’ from which one observes not only a thaw but the
extravagant hype accompanying any claimed successes of the BD approach. We do not propose
to digress into a discussion of AI, other than to point out that the concept has been subjected to
penetrating analysis among others by Roger Penrose [16], who argues cogently that no digital
computer will ever be capable of matching the human brain in terms of its ability to resolve
problems such as those that reside in the class of the Gédelian undecidable. It matters not one
iota that a so-called ‘AI machine’ has the capability of assimilating the contents of staggeringly
