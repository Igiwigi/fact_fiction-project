119. Solution of a cubic equation.
The question is to find a linear factor of the cubic

(a, b, e, dXa, yY
and this can be at once effected by means of the relation

Þ— OU%=—4p


"

- Hetween the covariants. The equation in fact shows that each of the expres8ions
4(Þ+ uUV/D), 4(Þ—U\/a)

is a perfect cube, and consequently that the cube root of each of these eXPresSIONs Is a
linear function of (a, y). The expression

VAÞ+UVa)—ViO-u/Sa)

is consequently a linear function of &, y, and it vanishes when U=0, that 1s, the expres-
3ion is a linear factor of the cubic.
