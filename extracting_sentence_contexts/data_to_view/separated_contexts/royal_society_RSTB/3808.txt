To this structure the term “integument” may still be applied (Hooker,
1864) : no evidence is so far forthcoming that it can be regarded as an “ ovary-wall”
(Srraspurcer, 1872; Lienrer and Trson, 1911), The most reliable evidence
concerning these structures should be obtained from developmental stages ; and these
are readily obtained without any difficulty from the axils of the uppermost scales of
a functional cone. Stages of development have been more or less illustrated by Hooker (1864) and
McN zs (1872) and others, but the main facts are still somewhat confused. Drawings
of early stages are given (figs. 5-8) for sectional elevations of transparent buds
seen from the anterior side ; while sections of the cone-apex give median elevations for
stages numbered in agreement with the tangential ones (fig. 5).
