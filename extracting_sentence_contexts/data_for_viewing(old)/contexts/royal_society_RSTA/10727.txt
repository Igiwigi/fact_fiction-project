We, of course, for both series selected experiments in which the personal error
would be large,* and accordingly could be easily dealt with. But the division of
scale lengths by the eye and the estimated position of a bright line are fundamental
in many types of physical observation. Further, large errors are for theoretical
purposes quite as good as, for practical purposes much better than, small, when we
wish to obtain an answer to the question: Are the fluctuations in personal equation
merely the result of random sampling, or are they due to the influence of immediate
atmosphere ?

So important is it to realise that these fluctuations are not due to random sampling,

* Asa matter of fact only at a maximum ,}, in dividing a line and 4}, in determining the position
of a bright line between two scale marks.

that I have worked out all the constants for the second series, for the whole set
of experiments, and for its first and second moiety.
They are given in the accompanying table.
