DEVELOPMENT OF CHICK AND DUCK EMBRYOS. 217

the graft tissues consist of a large mass of mesoderm. Above this the host ectoderm
is thickened to a greater extent than in cases like 610a, and has also formed a groove,
so that the general appearance is as though a primitive streak or very early neural
plate had been induced. There are also cases like 554, in which a posterior third has
apparently not developed any neural tissue, but, lying near the host neural plate,
has caused the latter to spread beyond its normal limits.

Thus, there is as yet no absolutely satisfactory case in which a graft, which has itself
not given any neural tissue, has induced a good medullary plate. But the tendency
towards inductions by such grafts, and the fact that induced plates frequently lie above
the mesodermal parts of grafts which also include neural material, suggests strongly
that the axial mesoderm is capable of induction in the absence of graft neural material.

Attempts have been begun to demonstrate the inducing capacity of mesoderm by
making grafts of notochord from older embryos into younger blastoderms. Three
grafts have been made from a 50-hour embryo into a 20-hour blastoderm, but, although
the notochord lived and probably developed normally, no induction occurred, The
number of experiments is, of course, insufficient to prove a negative, and even if further
work gives the same result, that negative will apply in the first instance only to a later
stage than that of the grafts of primitive streak. |

If it is granted that the induction obtained with pieces of primitive streak is, at
