SZ The results agreed very closely with those tabulated in Tables IL. and II, and

proved conclusively that the level error which I feel sure never amounted to as much

2” could not account for the difference between theory and experiment.

& The sme is fairly clear from the formulee, for in Table Il. we could reconcile theory
and experiment by supposing that at high angles of incidence Þ is somewhat greater
than 63? 44' 30”, and tha it decreases continually as the angle of incidence increases,
but this assumption would just tend to increase the differences given in Table IL.

Thus a small variable error in the value of Þ will not account for the observed
facts.
One point, however, needs further investigation. An error has been confessedly

- committed in the value of Þ. Can we assign a limit to its value ?

| The fact that the four poles P, Q, R4, R, are nearly bub not quite in the game zone

| renders it impossible to determine accurately the position of P and Q. The prism

was levelled by placing a mark across the slit, which when viewed directly appeared
