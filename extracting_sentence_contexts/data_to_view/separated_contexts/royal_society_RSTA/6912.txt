This is confirmed —
by gravimeter observations in south-west England. The scatter in the submarine measure- —
ments in the shallow parts of the area therefore seems quite normal. The fact that almost
twice as great a scatter should be found over the oceanic part is surprising, particularly
when it is remembered that these observations are made at a height of some 5 km. above the
sea bed. One must conclude that the earth’s crust under this part of the Atlantic Ocean is
even less homogeneous than below the mouth of the English Channel. These changes in gravity occur within distances which are certainly not greater than
100 km. and probably considerably less.
