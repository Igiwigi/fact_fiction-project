Such an
approach was taken by, for example, by Bodart & Larson [1], who disregarded convective
terms in the governing equations and considered integral quantities in the wall-normal
direction. Over all, this general approach has provided successful wall models that performed
well in specific parameter regimes, but failed to demonstrate adequate robustness for an
application in complex configurations at very high Reynolds numbers. This lack of robustness
is thought to be attributable to the fact that common wall-models rely on compensating for
the missing flow physics of the coarse-grid solution without addressing the errors due to
the SGS model or the numerical scheme. These errors, however, are not known a priori; for
this reason, wall-models borrowing features from optimal control theory have been proposed
and promoted. A first attempt to design a control-based near-wall model was undertaken by Nicoud et al. [2]:
a optimal-control framework was employed to best estimate the mean velocity profile from the
available stress components.
