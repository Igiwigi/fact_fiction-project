25'4 millims.; the minimum thickness near the edge is 9 millims. in the one case
and 10°6 millims. in the other.

In the Australian skull, No. 998, the maximum distance from the frontal crest
to the surface of the glabella amounts to 16 millims., and from the base of the
crest to 18 millims. Closely approximate measurements were obtained from two
other Australian skulls which have been bisected. Tortnarp cites measurements{
by Manovuverier which gave 15 millims. as the thickness of the frontal bone behind
the glabella in the case of 14 male skulls, and 8 millims. in eight female skulls, and
by WotkorF on 73 male skulls, which gave a mean of 12-13 millims. and a maximum
of 24-25 millims. No information is given as to the races represented by these
skulls, but in the maximum found by Woxkorr we have another illustration of the
fact that primitive characters which were at one time characteristic of the species
now only survive in exceptional individuals.

Since the external length is identical in the Gibraltar skull and the Australian,
No. 998, and the occipital bone is of about the same thickness in each, it follows
that the internal length must be more than 10 millims. less in the former, and
