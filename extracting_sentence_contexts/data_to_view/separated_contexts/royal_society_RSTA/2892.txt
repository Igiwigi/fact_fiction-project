Figure 7d-f shows the stability maps at the frequency that is higher than previous one. It
exceeds 2p by 50% and is shown in figure 6 by the blue dashed line. One can see that the
instability domains in figure 7a,b have been changed weakly, while they in fact disappear in
figure 7c. It can be understood from this viewpoint that the oscillations corresponding to branch
(4.15) (iii) cannot excite another mode since their amplitudes are small themselves (figure 6). In order to illustrate intermodal interactions, we performed numerical integration of the
original system (2.1) for chains with 20 massive elements.
