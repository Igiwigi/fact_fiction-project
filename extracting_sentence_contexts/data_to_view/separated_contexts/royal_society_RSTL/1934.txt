years ago in making some experiments on the effects
produced on the needle by unpolarized iron, I discovered that a peculiar polarity
was imparted to the iron by simply making it reyolve about‚Äù an axis; and this
naturally suggested the question to me, whether the magnetism of the earth, and
consequently, that of the other planets and the sun, might not be owing to their
rotation? From the effects which I have observed to be produced on iron by its
rotation, it appears probable, if the magnetism of these bodies be not caused by
their rotation, that at least the effects will be modified by, and, to a certain extent,
dependent on such rotation. Since first observing the fact, that simple rotation
will cause a peculiar polarity, if I may be allowed the expression, in iron, I have
made a great variety of experiments on the subject, which haye enabled me to trace
the laws according to which this polarity in the iron affects a magnetic needle,
independently of the effect ,produced by the mass. It would lead me to too great
a length here to state the several effects that are produced by the rotation of iron,
or the laws which govern them ; but I will briefly mention one. Let us imagine a
plane to pass through the centre of an horizontal needle, at right angles to the
meridian, and making an angle with the horizon equal to the dip ; then, if the
plane of a circular plate of iron coincide with this plane, and the plate be fixed on

an axis passing through its centre at right angles to its plane, s0 that it can be
made to reyolye in its own plane, the direction of the needle will be different,

according as the several points of the plate are brought into any particular position

by making it revolye in one direction or the opposite, excepting in four positions
of the centre of the plate, If the centre of the plate be successively placed to the
eat or west of the centre of the needle in the same horizontal line, and over the

needle in the plane of its meridian, then the deviation of the needle due to the

rotation of the plate will be in contrary directions in the two cases, the plate

revolving in the same direction in both.
