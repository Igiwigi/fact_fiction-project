fall significantly in the future in scenario 1. Under such a scenario, solar power plants might be
installed at the consumers’ location, leaving conventional generation and network assets stranded
(at least partially). On the other hand, if future investment costs remain at today’s levels, as
modelled in scenario 4, wind power generation (which is assumed to be significantly less costly
at present) is likely to be installed. Given that the location of candidate wind power generation
is far from the load centre, investment in this technology would also require further transmission
investment that needs to be planned significantly ahead of actual commissioning. In fact, we
assume that while the transmission line features a lag of 1 epoch (e.g. 5 years), the remaining
