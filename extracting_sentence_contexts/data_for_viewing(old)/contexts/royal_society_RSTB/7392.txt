Armeria

The calyces of Armeria have often been recognized in subfossil state, and some rather
inconclusive attempts at specific identification have been based upon their characters.
In 1940 Erdtman drew attention to the condition of floral dimorphism in Statice armeria L.
in which some plants bore ‘cob-like’ stigmas and coarsely reticulate spinous pollen grains
(type A), whilst others bore ‘papillate’ stigmas and more finely reticulate pollen (type B).
In the same year Iversen (1940) drew attention to the fact that the very homogeneous genus
Armeria can be separated into two groups very distinctly different, in that one (of European-
Mediterranean distribution) is dimorphic and parasterile, whilst the other, which includes
the holarctic form of northern America and Asia, has only monomorphic self-sterile species
in it. A. vulgaris Willd. is shown to be dimorphic and to include the Atlantic and maritime
var. maritima and the mountain var. alpina. On the other hand, the nearest holarctic

Armeria, A. labradorica, which now exists in northern Greenland, is monomorphic. In view
of these facts it is of particular interest to note not only that Armeria pollen occurs in these
late-Glacial Cornish deposits, but that since both A and B types of pollen occur, the
