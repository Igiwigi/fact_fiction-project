fibres repulsive electrostatic interactions and confirms the attribution of this peak to an intra-fibre
long-range order.

The viscoelastic properties presented below are studied at T=20°C on a series of samples
freshly prepared in water using the pH jump approach. Each sample has been systematically
vortexed to remove its shear history, before loading it in a plate-plate geometry. The
frequency-sweep experiments recorded in the linear viscoelatic regime (LVR) are performed
after 30min from loading. Frequency-sweep experiments are followed by strain sweep
(electronic supplementary material, figure S7) and step-strain experiments (figure 6; electronic
supplementary material, figure S8). The latter is employed to evaluate the recovery potential of
SLC16:0 hydrogels after applying shear stress with an amplitude out of the LVR. Studying the
theological behaviour of the gels after 30min from loading has the advantage of limiting the
dehydration, although its main drawback consists of the fact that the mechanical properties could
still evolve in time. If our choice may impact the absolute values of G’, it does not influence the
general trends and relative comparison among the samples at a given time.

Figure 5b shows the typical frequency-sweep experiments recorded in the LVR (y =0.1%;
electronic supplementary material, figure S7) for a set of samples at 2.5wt% and pH between
3 and 6, while figure 5c reports the concentration-dependent G’ values recorded at pH 5. G’
and G” curves are parallel with G’ > G’’ in the entire frequency range, thus demonstrating the
