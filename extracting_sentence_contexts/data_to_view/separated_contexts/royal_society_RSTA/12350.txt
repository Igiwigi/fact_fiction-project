In taking astronomical observations of the same kind with the same instrument,
g it has lately been discovered that two individuals differ sensibly from each other. This has led to the suspicion that in all observations there is a personal error due to
some obscure physiological cause that allows a small interval of time between
sensation and perception, or volition. If this were the same for the sense of hearing
as for vision, it could not affect the results of experiments on sound ; but it is quite
possible that it may be different, and the very fact that such personal errors do
exist, may justify a suspicion that such an effect might interfere and prevent a
perfect degree of accuracy from being obtained. We have made no hypothesis of the nature of the impinging surfaces of the
molecules. May the discrepancy arise from something omitted in this ?
