Many of the observations appear to

Ge of the highest interest, but no mention is made of the important fact of the
gpxistence of dimorphism. Polystomella crispa (Luxn.) is described as usually having
Fe or four nuclei, but is said to become many-nucleated during reproduction ; a form
a reproduction is also described in which the whole of the protoplasm leaves the shell
Bod divides up into numbers of young individuals which assume the characteristic
Fhape of the species. ScHAUDINN has, however, apparently failed to recognise what

Shicrospheric and possesses nuclei of a quite different character from that of the
Bregalospheri ic form. 4
