In the absence of an internal length scale, this competition
leads to the formation of an infinite number of infinitesimal cracks. The discreteness of the
problem supplies the length scale responsible for the finite scale of the microstructures. The striking structural stability of the commensurate microstructures in this model is
manifested by the fact that, even in the continuum limit, the infinitesimal parameter variation
does not affect their robust topological structure. Such locking was observed in experiments on
self-assembly of micropillars in drying systems [4] but has not been previously rationalized at
the conceptual level [14]. Robustness of this type can play an important role in stress-induced
developmental morphogenesis, ensuring, for instance, that the number of fingers or vertebra is
largely independent of the variation of external parameters [9].
