It does not even reach the lateral border of the cerebellum, for there it is limited by
the junction of the fissura prima with the fissura parafloccularis.

The cortex of the cerebellum contains the usual molecular, Purkinje and granular
layers. There are two cerebellar nuclei, medial and lateral. The lateral gives
origin to the brachium conjunctivum and probably corresponds to the combined
nuclei dentatus and globosus of higher mammals. The medial nucleus is much
smaller and appears to represent the nuclei emboliformis and fastigii. Fibres enter
the cerebellum in the corpus restiforme and the pons. Both convey numerous
trigeminal contributions. In addition, fibres pass directly to the cerebellum from
the entering trigeminal root, fig. 13, while others reach it via the brachium
conjunctivum. The trigeminal nerve thus enters very largely into the formation
of the cerebellumâ€”a fact which Hines has noted for Ornithorhynchus. Ventral
spino-cerebellar fibres reach the cerebellum along the brachium conjunctivum, and
tecto-cerebellar fibres from the superior and inferior colliculi through the anterior
medullary velum.

The outstanding features of the cerebellum of Echidna are the enormous hyper-
trophy of the lobus anterius and the paraflocculi, and the small size of the lobus
medius. In marsupials and most other primitive mammals the lobus anterius is so
small that it is often completely hidden from dorsal view by the large hood-like lobus
medius. Thus the cerebellum in the Monotremes is the complete antithesis of
that in all other primitive mammals. In higher mammals the increase in cortical
connections has evoked a progressive expansion of the lobus medius which, in the
higher Primates and Man, forms the major part of the total bulk of the cerebellum.
