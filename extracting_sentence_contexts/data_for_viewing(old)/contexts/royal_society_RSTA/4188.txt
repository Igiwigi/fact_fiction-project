Appendix A. Vaxj6 interpretation

This interpretation was born in attempt to combine consistently the views of Einstein and Bohr
[7]: realism and contextuality. This is the (ensemble) statistical interpretation. It was born from
the observation that, in fact, Bohr’s contextuality does not imply non-realism. Thus, a theory can
(but need not) be both contextual and realistic. Contextuality has to be treated statistically as
contextuality of probabilities, their dependence on experimental contexts.

Such contextuality means that each (experimental) context C determines its own Kolmogorov
probability space,!! Pc =(2¢,Fc,pc). Compatibility of a family of contexts C = (Cy) means that

We call it the ‘inverse Born problem’. Born solved the problem of the probabilistic interpretation of the quantum
measurement scheme. He presented the explicit formula transferring quantum entities into probabilities. Now, we want
to construct quantum entities from probabilities.

1 As was pointed out in Introduction, this viewpoint on contextuality is more general than the one used in the quantum.
