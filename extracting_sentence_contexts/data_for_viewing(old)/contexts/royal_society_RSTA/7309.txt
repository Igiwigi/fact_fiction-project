geometric mean formula (38) with explicit reference only to ground-to-ground field-
strengths, but it is evidently likewise applicable to the complete field (including phase) at

are the fields pertaining to homogeneous earths composed of the above-

all equal heights of the transmitter and receiver up to a maximum determined by the media
in question; and, incidentally, the hypothesis of transmission normal to the boundary may
be waived.

The fact that a linear differential equation leads to a solution expressed as the geometric
mean of two other solutions may appear startling at first sight, but it should be borne in mind
that the different fields are all (approximately) proportional to the same inverse power of
d, which is the only variable involved, so that (38) is simply a relation between the constants
of proportionality.

Millingtonâ€™s recognition of the geometric mean formula plays a considerable part in the
development of his technique. In appropriate cases it fixes the mixed-path curve at
sufficiently great distances beyond the boundary, and together with the further reasonable
assumption that, to a first order, the curve for points up to the boundary coincides with the
corresponding curve appropriate to a homogeneous earth, gives some indication of the field-
strength variation. The point we wish to make here, however, is that use of equation (38) is
only justifiable in special circumstances. The present analysis suggests a criterion for its
