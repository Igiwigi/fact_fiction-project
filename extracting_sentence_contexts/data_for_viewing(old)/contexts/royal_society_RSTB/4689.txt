cordatum. The Echinon√©idee, with evenly distributed podia, employ the tube-feet in
such feeble expressions of adhesion as the retention of small rock-particles as a
protective covering for the test (with subordinate locomotor function), while Conulus
shows some slight tendency towards phyllodal specialisation. Probably the exercise
of a respiratory function was the chief use of the Holectypoid podia, although the
absence of special petaloid development shows that it was only adopted incidentally.
The Jurassic types had greater powers of adhesion than the Cretaceous forms, while
the only living type has adopted the burrowing habits associated (in the Spatangide)
with an almost complete loss of adhesive power in the podia.

In this, the concluding section of the paper, the facts, principles and hypotheses
that have been described and enunciated in the foregoing pages are combined in an
endeavour to determine the morphogenetic relations existing between the ambulacra
of the Holectypoida and those of other orders. In arguments of this nature it is
inevitable that a high proportion of the personal element should be introduced, but pains

have been taken to restrain it. Principles of evolution that have an application over
far wider fields than that of ambulacral morphogeny are involved. Further, it is
practically impossible to exclude occasional phylogenetic arguments, although these
are subordinated to morphogenetic considerations. The various trends of evolution
