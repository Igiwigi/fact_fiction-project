In No. 32 we have (without alteration) 0=16; but in the application (Nos. 40 and
41) to the surface FP*+ GR*Q*=0 we have 9=0, and there are «=fpq off-points, F=0,
P=0, Q=0, and ,=gpq close-points, G=0, P=0, Q=0. The new equations involving
@ are thus satisfied.

7. I have ascertained that the value of Þ' obtained, Nos. 51 to 64 of the memoir, is
inconsistent with that obtained in the © Addition” by consideration of the deficiency,
and that it is in fact incorrect. The reason is that, although, as stated No. 583, the
values of two of the coefficients D, E may be as8umed at pleasure, they cannot, in con-
junction with a given system of values of A, B, C, be thus assumed at pleasure; viz. A,
B, C being =110, 272, 44 respectively, the values of D, E are really determinate.
