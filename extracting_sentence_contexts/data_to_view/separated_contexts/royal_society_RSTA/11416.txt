in fact, Sk may, by the rule of the modal third be determined from the median and the
mean—and, thence, e,; and e, by the above formule, make this a very convenient,
as well as scientifically accurate, method of appreciating the range and the skewness
of the variability at any station. Our discussion has now led us to the following general conclusions :—

(1.) The mode, the standard deviation, and the skewness fully define barometric
frequency. These three constants depend, in the first place, on geographical position,
and appear to be constant along certain lines—the generalised isobars.

(2.) A knowledge of these three constants enables us, by means of very simple
formule, to describe the chief physical features of the barometric frequency at any
station.

(3.) By aid of the twenty stations dealt with in this paper, a fair appreciation
can be obtained of the barometric frequency at any place whatever in the British
Isles by means of interpolation.
