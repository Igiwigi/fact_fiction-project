transversus the outer limb of the sulcus occipitalis transversus is joined by what
appears to be the upper end of the sulcus lunatus. This connexion is superficial,
for the two sulci are separated by a submerged gyrus. This sulcus, lying anterior
to the outer limb of the sulcus occipitalis transversus, can be traced without
interruption as far as the gyrus translunatus and is equally deep throughout its
extent. If we are to regard it as the pars dorsalis sulci lunati, the opercular sulcus
lunatus lies anterior to the sulcus occipitalis transversusâ€”a condition which I have
not previously encountered in the examination of a large number of brains.

There is a sulcus immediately lateral to the outer end of the sulcus occipitalis
transversus which passes backwards from the main sulcus. This might be regarded
as the upper end of the pars dorsalis sulci lunati ; but this is rendered doubtful by
the fact that is it a shallower sulcus than the main sulcus and does not cut it very
deeply. Since the extent of the area striata could not be determined it seems
desirable to leave the exact interpretation somewhat indefinite ; being satisfied
with the fact that the pars ventralis is clearly defined. Posterior to the large obliquely
placed sulcus five sulci are seen crossing the occipital regon. The most inferior of
them passes forwards under the lower end of the pars ventralis and is the sulcus
occipitalis inferior. The innermost from its topographical relations is the sulcus
paramedialis (22), the remainder are presumably intrastriate, although the extent
of the area striata was not determined.
