on physics on contemporary research is a more complex question that cannot be discussed here
for lack of space. Still, it is relevant to quote here an account of Hilbert’s ideas as described by
the physicist on whom Hilbert’s influence became most evident, Max Born. On the occasion of
Hilbert’s sixtieth birthday, at a time when he was deeply involved together with Bernays in the
technical difficulties raised by the finitist programme, Born wrote the following words:

The physicist set outs to explore how things are in nature; experiment and theory are
thus for him only a means to attain an aim. Conscious of the infinite complexities of
the phenomena with which he is confronted in every experiment, he resists the idea
of considering a theory as something definitive. He therefore abhors the word ‘Axiom’,
which in its usual usage evokes the idea of definitive truth. The physicist is thus acting
in accordance with his healthy instinct, that dogmatism is the worst enemy of natural
science. The mathematician, on the contrary, has no business with factual phenomena, but
rather with logic interrelations. In Hilbert’s language the axiomatic treatment of a discipline
implies in no sense a definitive formulation of specific axioms as eternal truths, but rather


the following methodological demand: specify the assumptions at the beginning of your
deliberation, stop for a moment and investigate whether or not these assumptions are partly
superfluous or contradict each other. [34]

The development of physics from the beginning of the century, and especially after 1905,
brought many surprises that Hilbert could not have envisaged in 1900 or even when he lectured
at Gottingen on the axioms of physics in 1905; yet, Hilbert was indeed able to accommodate these
new developments to the larger picture of physics afforded by his programme for axiomatization.
