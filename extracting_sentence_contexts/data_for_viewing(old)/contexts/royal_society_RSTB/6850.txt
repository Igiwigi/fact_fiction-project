the recent shocks were mostly of shallow local origin, the majority of the foci being
below the island.

Both series of earthquakes are therefore clearly ‘‘volcanic”’; that is to say they are
intimately connected with the local soufriére activity, and with general magmatic
conditions along the Caribbean volcanic arc.

(ii) Records of activity in the Caribbean volcanic arc. Prediction in regard to future
events in Montserrat and the Lesser Antilles is made very difficult by the almost
complete lack of continuous scientific records of past soufriére activity and local earth-
quake shocks, and by the vagueness of many of the accounts of isolated disturbances.
We even lack such elementary data as the number and location of active and extinct
soufriéres. Seismo-volcanic phenomena were in fact largely ignored until 1902. To a
large extent they are still disregarded unless attention is called to them by alarming
events.

From the facts at our disposal, however, there are important conclusions to be
drawn. We know (fig. 2) that since 1692 the longest period that has elapsed without
the occurrence of a volcanic disturbance somewhere in the arc, is forty-seven years;
that since 1766 the longest period of tranquillity has been twenty-eight years; and
that on seven occasions the interval between eruptions or minor volcanic activity has
been seven years or less. There is thus every reason to believe that eruptions or earth-
quakes will be renewed in the volcanic arc at no very distant date, and probably more
than once in the lifetime of the present generation.
