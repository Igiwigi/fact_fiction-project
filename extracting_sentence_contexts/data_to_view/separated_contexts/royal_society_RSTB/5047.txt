After metamorphosis, ambulacral plates
are added rapidly, while tube-feet make their appearance very, very slowly (figs. 17,
19, 20, 9, 11, 12 and 13). Since the plates precede the tube-feet the pores must be formed
in a different way from those of Echinus. They are, in fact—with the exception of those
belonging to the first five tube-feet—formed by resorption of part of the test from within
to accommodate the developing tube-feet. The ambulacral plates are, in young
specimens, considerably thinner in the parts where the pores will later be formed than
elsewhere. The pores of the petaloid portions and of the modified “ petal ” also appear
to be formed in the same way, although the tube-feet appear soon after the ambulacral
plates have been laid down and while the plates are still small.
