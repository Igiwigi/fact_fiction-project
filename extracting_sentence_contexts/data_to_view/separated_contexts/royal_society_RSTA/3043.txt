Again \, should be a constant for the glass, and therefore the same for tension and

@ressure, if the stress-optical coefficient be independent of the nature and magnitude

Bf the load applied. & Now Table ILI. shows clearly that, although the values of /W, differ in sign, they

Bie only very roughly of the same order of magnitude.

% Possibly this might be accounted for by the fact that in different experiments the

Bight did not pass through the same parts of the glass, so that the value of the

‘gesidual stress might have been different. 5 The divergences in \, are considerable; , appears systematically larger for

“Pressure than for tension,*
