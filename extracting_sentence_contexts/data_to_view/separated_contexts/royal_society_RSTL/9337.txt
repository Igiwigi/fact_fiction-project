k=«,_, in the equations, «g, @, Oy, . . . &.z are alternately positive and negative and
each is less than 45 of the one after it ; we have, in fact,

and since when k=k«,_;, p,4,=—%z, 4, will also be negative. But, in the same
manner, when we substitute k=x, or-any greater quantity, the series a 0, . . . &, are
alternately positive and negative, and remain 80 as k changes from «, to +>.
