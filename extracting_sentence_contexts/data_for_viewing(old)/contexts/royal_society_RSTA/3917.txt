Importantly for our discussion, the duty of the service provider is not just an expression of a : &
contractual bond between the provider and the affected data subject, duties between individual :s
right owners. Rather, the duty is (also) owed to the wider public, protecting the collective interest :S
in privacy as a common good.

Importantly, as we saw the Directive also entails an active duty by the provider to establish
‘the whole truth’ of the breach. The hacked service providers are not just passive reporters of
information that they have obtained. This establishes a rather unusual form of legal duty—a duty
of a victim of a crime not only to report the event, but also, to a degree, to investigate it. We will
return to this issue below.

Finally, the Directive adds a number of reporting obligations for providers, who will have
to maintain an inventory of data breaches. This inventory has to note all the relevant facts that
the provider was able to establish, the effects of the breach and any remedial action that was
taken. Regulators will use the information gained from these registers to evaluate the efficiency
of existing legislation and guidelines, and to develop best practice. We noted above that the
European approach extends the scope of notification duties beyond customers to third parties
whose data were held. Here, we see this idea extended further—the beneficiaries of this aspect
of the notification duty are not just those individuals who suffered harm, but through improved
efficiency of the legal system, everybody.

We can now extend our environmental analogy. As we saw above, in stewardship models
of land ownership a collective responsibility arises to ‘be concerned about’ and ‘look after’ the
environment, something that can best be done if information about problems is spread widely.
A duty to report oil spills, e.g., will give an incentive to companies to invest in security equipment,
