Without entering into detailed discussion, we may say that this
observation suggests strongly that the full x — 8 transformation of hair is accom-
panied by an elongation of the keratin complex of approximately 100 per cent., and that
some relation on this basis must exist between the respective dimensions and features
of the « and 8 X-ray photographs. If now we assume that the two strong meridian
reflections, 5.15 A.U. and 3.32 A.U., that characterise the reversible transformation,
are linked by the relation
5.15 < (3 X 3.32)

we have at once a quantitative explanation of the maximum extension and also the clue
to the nature of the keratin chain. According to this scheme the transformation may be
represented as follows :—

The complete passage from the ¢-form to the $-form must take place in three stages,
corresponding to the fact that hair in cold water may be stretched twice as far, and hair
in steam three times as far, as hair which is perfectly dry. It is possible that these three
stages are an expression of the three obvious ways in which the «-chain may be written
down, but in any case it seems clear that the constituent involved in the middle stage,
from about 30 per cent. extension to about 70 per cent. extension, is that part of the hair
substance which is sufficiently crystalline to give rise to the X-ray photographs. It is
proposed to deal with this, and all the other many points bearing on the complex elastic
properties of hair, in the next communication of this series —W.
