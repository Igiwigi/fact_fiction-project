Isobutylaldoxime acts upon the tortoise vessels in the same way as propylaldoxime,
the only difference being that equal effects are produced by weaker solutions. Much weaker solutions of cenanthaldoxime suffice, apparently, to produce complete
dilatation of the vessels of the tortoise, since the same maximal flow is attained both
before and after destroying the spinal cord. In very dilute solutions, however, cenanthaldoxime differs from both propyl- and
from isobutylaldoxime by the fact that a greater relative degree of vaso-dilatation is
produced after than before pithing the spinal cord. In this the cenanth- agrees with
the ethyl- compound, and in both cases the explanation is found in the action of the
drug on the spinal centres. Heart.—In their action on the heart all these aldoximes agree in producing an
accelerated rhythm. ‘The primary tonic influence seen to be possessed hy ethyl-
aldoxime is exerted to a less extent by propylaldoxime.
