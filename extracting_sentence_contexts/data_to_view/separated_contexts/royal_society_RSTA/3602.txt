This is, of course, in accordance with ARNOLD’Ss
and Sreap’s results. It should be remembered, however, that the structures of
annealed specimens in particular were found to be by no means uniform, so that a
complete survey of the sections had to be made in order to get a just comparison of
the different granular structures. To return to the elastic properties of the Lowmoor iron, attention may be called to
the fact that the permanent sets which occurred at the various yield-points are
marked in both series of curves in Diagram 5, and also at the yield-points in
Diagram 4. The total elongation of the specimen of Diagram 4, owing to the
position of the fracture, could not be exactly measured, but it was probably about
12 per cent. on a 4-inch length.
