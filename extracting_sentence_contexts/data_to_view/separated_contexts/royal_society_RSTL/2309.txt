It is hence extremely doubtful, whether a general distri-
bution of electricity in mere space would eyer occur, supposing the electrified sub-
stance to be the only existing body in the universe : directly, however, that we assume
the existence of another body, then in a space deyoid of resistance, the resulting in-
duction would generate an attractive force, which, however small, would cause an
electrical current to flow through a distance, howeyer great.

75. In accordance with this deduction, it may be shown, that an electrified sphere
having an extremely perfect insulation, and projecting within the centre of a yery
large receiver, retains its electricity more completely under a diminished pressure,
than in the atmosphere ; especially under ordinary conditions of aerial currents, im-
perfect insulation arising from extraneous bodies, and the like. This fact seems to
have hitherto escaped detection, and therefore, the notice it merits ; and I am inclined
to believe, that we may eventually find it requisite to modify, to some extent, our views
of the cause of electrical dissipation. The following experiment is of singular interest
as bearing upon this point. (w.)
