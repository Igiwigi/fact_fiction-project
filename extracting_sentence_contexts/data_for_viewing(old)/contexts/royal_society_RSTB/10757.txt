Here we argue that the efforts to identify the correct expla-
nations for brain size evolution have foundered on four major
issues. The first, and undoubtedly most pervasive, has been a
failure to distinguish between different levels of explanation
(sensu [2]): authors often implicitly suppose that evidence for
one hypothesis undermines all the other explanations even
though the hypotheses under test may in fact be complemen-
tary and equally necessary. A second problem has been that
too many studies still only provide evidence for a single
hypothesis, and fail to test adequately between alternatives
(see also [3]). A third issue has been a failure to specify exactly
how brain size impacts on cognition (e.g. exactly what aspects
of primate behaviour are so cognitively demanding) and how
this relates to the underlying neurobiology [3,4]. The fourth
issue has been a tendency to favour hypotheses that only
apply to a subset of species, even within the primates. Expla-
nations that apply only to special cases may be true, but they
cannot be general explanations.
