gradient are making it harder to satisfy the Wolfe conditions, and more line searches are needed.
This behaviour also starts to show in the later iterations of the other cases. Figure 11b depicts
the relative improvement in the cost function within an optimization window in terms of the
amount of iterations. It can be seen that, after 60 iterations, the improvement rate of the cost
function significantly diminishes. Therefore, in order to limit computational expenses, in practice
we stop all optimizations after Nit = 60. Figure 11c shows the cost functional as a function of PDE
evaluations. The circle markers indicate the data points for which Nit = 60. Figure 11c shows that
all cases achieve reasonable convergence for the chosen iteration limit, ie. further improvements
of the cost functional are minimal.

Figure 12 shows the sensitivity of convergence rate of C3t0 to m, i.e. the amount of retained
correction pairs used in the update for the Hessian approximation in the L-BFGS-B algorithm. It
can be seen from Figure 12 that m = 3 converges more slowly than m = 5,7 or 9. The fact that using
more Hessian correction pairs, i.e. 1 =9 over m=7, does not always lead to an improvement in
convergence rate can be attributed to the irrelevance of gradient information from many iterations
earlier. In the remainder of this work, we choose m = 5, as this proved to be an adequate parameter
