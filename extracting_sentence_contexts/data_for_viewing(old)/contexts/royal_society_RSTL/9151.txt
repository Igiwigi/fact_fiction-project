previous paper, there is a general tendency for the smaller segments of an Aurelia divided I
in this way to contract less frequently than the larger segments; and more careful
observation this year has not resulted in establishing any more precise a relationship.

1t would be tedious and unnecessary to quote my obseryations in this connexion ; but -
as these observations brought out very clearly a fact which T had prevyiously suspected,
I may detail one experiment to illustrate this point. The fact in question is, that the
potency of the lithocysts in any given segment of a divided Awrelia has more to do with
the frequency of its pulsations than has the size of the segment. As mentioned in my
other paper, one or more lithocysts may often be obseryed to be permanently prepotent
over the others; and I may here observe that the segmentation experiments just described
have shown the converse to be true, viz. that one or more lithocysts are often perma-
nently feebler than the others. Well, if a specimen of Aurelia exhibiting decided
prepotency in one or more of its lithocysts be watched for a considerable length of time,
s0 as to be snre that the prepotency is not of a merely temporary character, and if
the animal be then divided into segments in such a way that the prepotent lithocysts
shall occupy the smaller segments, it may be observed, provided time be left for
the tissues to recover shock, that the segments containing the prepotent lithocysts,
