Ficures 26 to 28, Longitudinal serial sections from the margin to the centre of a young leaf primor-
dium (stippled), showing the prism-shaped cells of which the primordium is composed: one of
these cells ae near the centre is enlarging and will become the apical cell of the primordium.
The underlying cells are in a state of active division. A, direction of apical cell of shoot; la,

Ficure 29, Young leaf primordium in transverse section. ‘The clear cells are the outgrowing cells of
the primordium which have been cut through; the stippled region consists of the outer walls of
the adjacent m matic cells, At this stage a single apical cell is not in evidence. ‘The arrow
indicates the direction of the shoot apex. (x 170.)

From an examination of comparable leaf primordia in transverse sections, confirmation
was obtained of the fact that the very young primordium consists, not of a single enlarged
cell, but of a group of prism-shaped cells (figure 29). These cells rise above the general
level of the adjacent cells of the meristem and in thin, basipetal, serial sections are the first
to be cut. In figure 29 the stippling indicates the outer walls of cells of the apical meristem,
the clear cells being those of the outgrowing primordium which, at the same level, have
been cut through, ‘This point is illustrated by the photomicrographs in figures 76, 77,
plate 29, A later stage, as seen in transverse section, is illustrated in figure 78, plate 29.

There are thus no essential differences between the early stages of leaf formation in
ferns and flowering plants. In each, the young primordium arises as an outgrowth of the
