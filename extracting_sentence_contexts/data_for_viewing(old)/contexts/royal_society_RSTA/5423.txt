upper-second class honours degree. Beyond that, other factors, such as enthusiasm, hard work,
diligence, perseverance and creativity, become equally or even more important.

In his book Contrary Imaginations: A Psychological Study of the English Schoolboy, Liam Hudson
[2, p. 108] says about this matter:

Originality in most spheres would seem to depend, among other qualities, on persistence:
on the pursuit of a given train of thought far beyond the limits that the ordinary citizen can
countenance.

Later he continues [2, p. 124]:

The relation of IQ to intellectual distinction seems, in fact, highly complex. As far as one
can tell, the relation at lower levels of IQ holds quite well. Higher up, however, it dwindles;
and above a certain point, a high IQ is of little advantage.

An earlier researcher, quoted by Hudson [2, p. 128], puts it in another way:

High but not the highest intelligence, combined with the greatest degree of persistence,
will achieve greater eminence than the highest degree of intelligence with somewhat less
persistence.

Well, after these various remarks about the makings of a good researcher, my recommendation to
you is ‘give it a try!’
