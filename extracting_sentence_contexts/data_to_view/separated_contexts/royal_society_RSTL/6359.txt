S exceeding 13 ounce. Mr. M*CULLaGn seems also to have noticed the same facts; and,
Eindeed, it is not likely they could haye been unnoticed by any one who had been engaged
Emuch in speculum-casting ; but the obvious fact that any considerable mass of an
Zalloy with such large expansions and contractious as speculum-metal, and s0 brittle,
= must fall to pieces if cooled rapidly, would have forbidden the attempt to mannfacture
Slarge telescopes with such a material. DS In all our carlier experiments the castings were made in damp sand, precisely as in
S the common process of casting iron or brass. Where the founder, however, aims at the
Sbest results, especially in brass-casting, he dries the mould : he thus escapes the mischief
Whontimes arising from the evolution of hydrogen, which, unlike steam, makes its way
E through the sand with difficulty.
