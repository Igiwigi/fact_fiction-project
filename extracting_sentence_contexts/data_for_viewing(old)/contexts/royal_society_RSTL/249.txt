but there was no recurrence of them after the wound was com-
pletely healed.

This is a very important fact; as it proves: that inflammation
on the cut end of a nerve, while in an irritable state, is capable
of producing exactly the same symptoms as the original disease.
This effect of inflammation upon the end of a nerve, explains
the startings of the limb which occur too frequently after ampu-

bf tation.

&1 These most commonly are met. with when the- limb is taken
E off above the knee, and the nerves and-vessels have; been pre-
S viously inflamed higher than the part | at which they were
E divided; and where the nerve is confined by the thickened
SI state of the surrounding parts.
