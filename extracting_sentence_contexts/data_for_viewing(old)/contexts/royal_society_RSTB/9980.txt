during the first wave was often a concern with ultimate expla- =

study of proximate explanations in one particular area: the
role of energetic status in physiologically determining fertility.
For example, Blurton-Jones’s [29] model described above
assumes that energetic status influenced by backload is the
proximate determinant of birth spacing. Many evolutionary
demographers make the assumption that throughout most of
human history physiological mechanisms would probably
have been of paramount importance in determining fertility
(rather than any behavioural manipulation of fertility). In
fact, the new sub-discipline of reproductive ecology emerged
in the 1990s. This is an evolutionary discipline which has
explored relationships between energetic status and repro-
ductive physiology, particularly via hormonal mechanisms
[38-40]. Reproductive ecologists have now clearly demon-
strated that reproductive physiology responds to energetic
flux—not just the availability of energy but also energetic
expenditure—and have proposed that these are adaptive
responses that calibrate reproduction to the local environment.
Under conditions of energetic stress, reproduction should be
downregulated to avoid attempting a reproductive bout
which is likely to end in costly failure. In contrast, conventional
demography has paid less attention to the purely physiological
