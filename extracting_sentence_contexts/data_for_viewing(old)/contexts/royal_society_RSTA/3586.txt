(a) The importance of understanding mechanisms

Adrian Sutton Before I open up the discussion to the floor, I’d like to ask the question
of whether we actually care what the mechanism is. There are people
working very hard on trying to design alloys with suitable traps so that
the problem is completely circumvented. Now, that’s a good engineering
solution to the problem—why do we want to know the mechanisms?
Does anybody want to have a go at that? Why are the mechanisms

important?
Reiner Kirchheim Because it’s related to the sixty million dollar question, and I would like DoS
to answer that despite the fact that I won’t get the money. :=

We have to ask how a dislocation moves, and it moves by kink pair 13
formation. You can show in an extended Gibbsian treatment that you : =

If kink pair generation is a rate-controlling process, then you enhance eri

There are two things to consider. First, can you prove that in terms of : Ss
thermodynamics? It has been shown by DFT [density functional theory] 8
