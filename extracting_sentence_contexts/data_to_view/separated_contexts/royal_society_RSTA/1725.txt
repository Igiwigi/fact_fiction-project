The semigroup S satisfies the assumptions of Theorem 7.1 for the function u = 1; indeed, the first
assumption follows from the fact that S(t) maps 17(0,1) into the form domain H1(0,1) for each
time t, and the second assumption can be shown by explicitly computing the resolvent of A at the
point 0 and by using a relation between the resolvent behaviour and the eigenfunction; we refer
to [56, Theorem 6.11] and [51, Theorem 4.2] for details. Hence, we have S(t) > 0 for all sufficiently large times t. The fact that the semigroup in the above example is not positive was first observed by
Khalid Akhlil (K. Akhlil, private communication, 2013); he also gave a detailed treatment of
the semigroup in [63, Section 3]. The semigroup appeared as an example of individual eventual
positivity in [56, Theorem 6.11] and of uniform eventual positivity in [51, Theorem 4.2].

(b) Schrodinger systems

Plenty of further examples for eventual positivity can be found in [50, Section 6], [56, Section 6]
and [64, ch. 11].
