Starting from the
assumption of simple cubic autocatalytic nonlinearity, we seem to have found there are two
broad cases: Schnakenberg-like, where there is a unique homogeneous equilibrium; and Gray-
Scott-like, where there is bistability between competing high- and low-intensity states. However,
it seems that any universality is not just due to the particularly simple functional form. In fact, the
Schnakenberg-like universality was first identified in [12] for a generalization of a wave-pinning
model of cell polarity [31,32] and a model for crime-wave hotspots [33]. We have also found
similar structures in models of similar bifurcations of predatory-prey systems [24,25]. Similar
structures have also been observed in models of desertification [34,35].
