respiration, the left ventricle ceased to beat, the right yentricle retaining its
function ; on renewing the respiration, the left yentricle resumed its beat, It
appears from this experiment, that from want of a degree of irritability equal
to that of the right ventricle, and its own proper stimulus of arterial blood,
the left yentricle ceased its contractions. The function of the right yentricle
must 800n cease in consequence, from want of a supply of blood.

These facts prove that arterial blood is the necessary stimulus of the left
side of the heart, its irritability being low ; but that yenous blood is a sufficient
stimulus of the right, from its higher irritability : the phenomena plainly flow
from the law, that the quantity of respiration and the degree of irritability,
observe an inverse ratio to each other, and from the facts on which that law is
founded. In this double sense, besides that of distinct cavities, the mammalia
have, therefore, two hearts ; and as the highly aerated blood of the left is the
peculiar property of birds and the mammalia,s0 the highly irritable fibre of the
right may be compared to that of the heart of reptiles and the fishes.

Except for the objection to new terms, the left side of the heart might be
termed arterio-contractile, and the right veno-contractile ; the first being stimu-
lated by arterial, the second by venous hlood.

It is quite obvious that the heart will bear a suspended respiration better,
the more nearly its irritability approaches to that which may be designated
veno-contractile. The power of bearing a suspended respiration thus becomes
