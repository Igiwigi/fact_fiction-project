of that vertebra in Auchenia or Camelus. In the sixth cervical the bases of the pleur-

which makes a step toward the Cameline modification. The diapophyses are imperfo-
rate in the seventh cervical of Palauchenia: in that vertebra of the Dromedary's skeleton
in the British Museum (673 @) the vertebral artery traverses lengthwise the base of each
diapophysis; but in a specimen in the College of Surgeons' Museum (No. 3455) the
vertebral arteries do not perforate any part of the vertebra. In both, as in the skeletons
of the Camels, Dromedaries, and Lamas at the Jardin des Plantes, where first (in 1831)
observyed the fact, the vertebral arteries enter the neural canal of the sixth cervical and
perforate the neurapophyses, emerging forward at the inner side of the base of each
prezygapophysis. In the seventh cervical vertebra of a Lama's skeleton in the British
Museum, as in the corresponding one of that in the Surgeons' Museum (Catalogue of
the Oxteology, 4to, 1853, p. 578, No. 3487), the right diapophysis is perforated by the
vertebral artery, the left one not.

In 8ize and general shape the cervical vertebree of Palauchenta recall those of Macrau-
chenia, but detailed comparison brings out greater differences than any of those above
noted in Auchenia and Camelus.

The vertebra dentata of Palauchenia differs from that of MacraucheniaÂ® in being more
Slender, in having a lower neural spine, in the shorter diapophyses, and in the non-bifur-
