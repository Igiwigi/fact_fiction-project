experiments being 1°40, and the blood volume expressed as a percentage of body
weight 5°27 per cent. Comparing this with ABDERHALDEN’s constant (1°59) and
blood percentage {4°64 per cent.), it is seen that they find about 13 per cent. more
blood than either ABDERHALDEN or ourselves, and that this is the case whether the
blood volume be calculated as a function of the surface or as a percentage of the body
weight.

It is further to be seen from ABDERHALDEN’S experiments that there is no definite
difference in the blood volume of males and females, the average blood constant being
practically the same in both sexes. This is in agreement with the results (already
published) of our own experiments, pregnant animals being, of course, excluded.

Tn our last paper we drew attention to the fact that the power % in our formula
for the blood volume was only approximately correct. This is shown by the fact that
if the animals be grouped ‘together the constant shows a tendency towards a slight
inerease in the light-weight groups compared with its size in the heavy-weight
groups when the weights of the animals cover a sufliciently large range. At the
same time we pointed out that if the body surface be calculated from the body
weight according to Mern’s formula (S = k. W') the power § in this case is only

approximately correct also, as here, too, the constant & in this formula shows
a tendency to be slightly smaller in the lighter animals than in the heavier ones.
