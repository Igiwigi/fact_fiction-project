components in the model, the drive to eat will depend on ble increment in the drive to eat. At the same time, it can be
the balance between the positive and inhibitory effects of deduced that the increase in FM will lead to a decrease in
FFM and FM. These effects will vary with the sex and age inhibition of appetite owing to the onset of leptin and insulin
of the individual, the degree of obesity, the relative amounts resistance. Consequently, as a person becomes fatter (and also
of FFM and FM, and the state of energy balance (positive, accrues FFM) they will display a stronger drive to eat

negative or in balance). accompanied by a weakening inhibition, i.e. a reduction in


the strength of the signals that suppress eating. Therefore,
people living with obesity do not receive any help from
their increasing amounts of stored energy (as fat) to constrain
their appetite. In fact the opposite is true; appetite self-control
becomes more difficult. There is another social implication of
the physiological determinants of the drive to eat. It is clearly
observed that people with a high BMI (living with obesity)
consume more energy than lean people. This is often
explained by a lack of self-control, absence of will power or
a failure of self-discipline. While the initial causes of overcon-
sumption and weight gain are probably rooted in a range of
biological, psychological, social, and environmental pressures,
the increases in FFM and FM seen with initial weight gain
may exacerbate the progressive escalation of body weight
owing to an increase in the tonic drive to eat (increased FFM)
and reduced inhibition (increased FM), especially when
