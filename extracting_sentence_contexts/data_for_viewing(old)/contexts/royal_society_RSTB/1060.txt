in the same plane as I. (fig. 54), or into an anterior and posterior cell. In other cases
II. may first divide into two daughter-cells placed side by side (figs. 55, 56, 57),
while III. appears immediately beneath these, or close to the posterior pole of the
embryo (figs. 55, 56); IV. then emerges beneath I. or elsewhere, I. having in the
meantime divided into a more anterior and a more posterior cell (fig. 58).

Sometimes the two daughter-cells of II. divide by a longitudinal constriction each
into two cells placed side by side (fig. 57). In many cases a merocyte may be seen
to divide before emerging from the yolk (figs. 53, 57, 63). Stages in the origin of the
second blastomere from the yolk have evidently been observed by Lana, who regarded,
however, the emerging merocyte as indicating the point of completion of the blasto-

derm ; that this is not so is evident from the fact that it does not coincide in position
with the point of completion of the blastoderm in this form or any other examined.

Fig. 69 shows the blastopore which becomes, later, closed by an emerging merocyte
(figs. 68, 71). Fig. 127 is a section passing through the blastopore at this stage.

Balanus balanoides.

The process of formation of the blastoderm in this species (see Hork (30)) are
probably quite similar to that described in Lepas anatifera, Chthamalus stellatus,
Balanus perforatus, &c. The second polar body was seen by Hokx, but supposed by
WEIsMANN and IsnrKawa to be the first. The basal plane is described and figured
