These are equations (5), (6) and (7) of Emmons & Brainerd (1942) in different notation,
the relation between the notations being as follows: Here Hit; pile 2n* u* v¥ Qw

the second of these relationships following from the fact that is constant in Emmons &
Brainerd (1942) so that 7/7, = p,/p. A further change of independent variable simplifies considerably the numerical or
mechanical integration both of the set of equations (6-8) for zero pressure gradient and, at
least for constant ¢, that of the more general equations (6-7). This is the use of
