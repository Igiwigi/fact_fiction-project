It would seem to harmonise with the thalamic
corticipetal fibres, which Fiecusic has recently described as the first, second, and
third “sensory” systems, ascending respectively to the Rolandic area, the falciform
lobe, the frontal region, and gyrus fornicatus, myelinating at different periods. Many of the fibres of the tegmentum appear to pass through the optic thalamus
without ending in it, while others terminate in this ganglion. This is shown by the
fact that destruction of the lateral and ventral parts of the optic thalamus led to a

more extensive degeneration than that following destruction of the tegmentum alone,
