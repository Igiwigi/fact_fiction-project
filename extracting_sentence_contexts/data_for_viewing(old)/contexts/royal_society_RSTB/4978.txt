of the circulating blood is shown in the same way. From the blood volume curve it
will appear—even taking the blood volume before the experiment at the highest
point which is consistent with all the determinations, namely, 6°4 litres, and that
just before leaving the chamber on the 25th at the lowest, namely, 7‘1 litres—there is
an increase of 700 cc. of blood. Similarly, the oxygen capacity would appear
before the experiment to have been not more than 1020 e.c., and at the close of the
experiment not less than 1130 c.c., a rise of about 10 per cent.

The comparison of the various curves in fig. 2 is instructive. During the night
of the 23rd to the 24th there was a considerable rise in blood volume. This initial
rise was accompanied by a considerable fall in the heemoglobinometric reading,
suggesting that the increased blood volume was caused mainly by dilution. This
suggestion is borne out by the fact that there was no appreciable change in the total
oxygen capacity. Between the morning and evening determinations on the 24th a
considerable amount of exercise was taken in the warm chamber on the bicycle
ergometer. There was a marked rise in the hemoglobinometer reading; this rise
was reflected in the measurement of total oxygen capacity. It would appear,
therefore, that from some store or stores within the body enough corpuscles could
be produced in a few hours to make an appreciable rise in the total oxygen capacity
of the circulating blood. It will be noted that there was no increase in the
reticulated cell-count on the 24th. On the night of the 25th—-26th there was a
dilution of the blood similar to that of the previous night, followed in the day by a
restoration of the hemoglobin value. On the evening of this day the number of
reticulated cells in the circulation was very considerably increased. This was the
first indication of a fresh production of red blood corpuscles.
