At first
hydrogen fluoride comes over; and at this point of the process the flow of the hydrogen
requires a little attention. At about 132‚Äù C., with the silicates described in this memoir,
the silica first becomes visible in fine flocks in the ammonia solution, and in another minute
the whole is cloudy. In from five to ten minutes the temperature has risen to 142%145?,
and 80 much of the fluoride has come over that the contents of the tube are of a semi-
solid consistency, and nearly the whole of it has in fact passed over. The temperature
is allowed to increase to 150?, and the retort then permitted to cool. The process is
repeated by introducing a fresh charge of hydrogen fluoride into the retort and of
ammonia into the test-tube, and again heating in the paraffin bath.
