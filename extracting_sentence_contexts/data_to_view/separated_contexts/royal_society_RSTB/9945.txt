The median per cent Cy values from C39 acids and C3; alkanes
are in good agreement with each other (63% and 68%, respect-
ively). Although vegetation structure changes throughout this
interval, mixed C3â€”C4 and C4-dominated landscapes are most
common, particularly after 1.9 Maa. In fact, there are only three
samples that indicate C3-dominated landscapes, all around
2.25 Ma. The data from 2.3 to 1.9 Ma are rather sparse, but
can be characterized as highly variable as they span nearly
the full range of vegetation. After 1.9 Ma, plant wax data
show continued variability, but fall mostly between 39 and
97% C4 vegetation (figure 3).
