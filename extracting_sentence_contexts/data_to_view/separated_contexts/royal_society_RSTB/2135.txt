Indeed, in a subsequent paper published
in the ‘ Philosophical Transactions’ for 1885, I showed that unicellular alge are not
present. However, Herr FrENzEL does not seem to have seen that paper. I shall
have occasion further on to refer to FRENzet's observations, so I need not now give
further quotations from his papers, except to call attention to the fact that he does
not think the colouring matter found in the glandular epithelium is related to
chlorophyll. However, he has not used the spectroscope in his work, and is not,
therefore, in a position either to confirm or deny the truth of my statements. He
acknowledges, however, that there is no difference between the pigment colouring the
contents of the ferment and the fat-holding cell of Crustacea, and that colouring the
contents of the ferment cell and the granular cell of the Mollusca.
