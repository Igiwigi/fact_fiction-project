A similar dispersion, due
Sapparently to the same cause, was observed in the case of one of the common reddish
gbrown German wine bottles. The sensibility of these glasses appears to be due to
Zan alkaline sulphuret. A bead purposely coloured in this manner was in fact found
Ea disperse a red light like the glasses. Moreover, in the confused masses obtained
=Ã¾v fusing sulphate of soda and sulphate of potash on charcoal before the blowpipe,
Scertain portions were found which dispersed a red light, and that pretty copiously
for an inorganic substance. A similar dispersion was observed among the products
obtained by fusing together sulphur and carbonate of potash, while other parts of the
Fronfued mass exhibited dispersion of a different kind.
