The overlapping of the Paleozoic
families upon Mesozoic families has been admitted by several authorities. Take, for
example, Professor NicHoxson’s treatment of the Turbinolida (‘ Manual,’ Joc. cit.,
p- 266) :—“The Recent genera Guynia and Haplophyllia, again, are remarkable in
the fact that the symmetry of the corallum is tetrameral, and they thus serve to lead
us to such ancient types as the Cyathaxonide of the Carboniferous rocks. . , . The
Silurian corals which have been included in the genus Cyathaaxonia belong, however,
to the genus Lindstramia, which may also be referable to this division (Turbinolide)
of the Madreporaria, though it will be here provisionally placed among the Rugosa.”
