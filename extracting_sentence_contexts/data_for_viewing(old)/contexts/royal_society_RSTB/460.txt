160 PROFESSOR A. M. PATERSON ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF

white Rami arise from the second and third (and in man fourth (2) ) sacral nerves
which pass over without joining the ganglia ; becoming connected with the hypo-
gastric plexus, they are distributed as the Nervi erigentes (vaso-inhibitory fibres).
They are possibly also viscero-inhibitory.

The only spinal nerves which come into direct communication with the sympathetic
ganglia are the vasomotor fibres. In fact, so convinced is GASKELL of this that he
maintains that “this chain might, therefore, be most appropriately called the chain
of vasomotor ganglia, instead of the present meaningless title of main sympathetic
chain.” GaskELL shows, moreover, that these vasomotor fibres are conducted along
the sympathetic chain from their source to their distribution. In the anterior
thoracic region they pass forwards along the chain to be distributed to the carotid
and vertebral arteries, to the arm, and to the heart. In the posterior part of the
thorax they pass backwards to the aorta, abdominal vessels, and lower limbs.

The functions of the gangliated cord of the sympathetic thus appear to be :—
1. To nourish the vasomotor fibres after converting them into non-medullated fibres ;
and 2. To act as “a guiding rod” to direet the course of the stream of vasomotor
tibres emerging from the cerebro-spinal axis.
