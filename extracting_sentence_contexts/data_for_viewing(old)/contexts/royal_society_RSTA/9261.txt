eye. From this point of view there can be no question of standardising data; no
question of defining any set of experimental results as “true,” or as representing the
performance of the average eye. Every new group of observed facts must be put in
its proper relationship to those already known in order to build a structure of knowledge
concerning the phenomena of vision which becomes more comprehensive in scope and
more secure in its foundations with every accession of properly accredited facts. The
experimental results given in the present paper are presented, and their relations to
others discussed, simply as a contribution to the growing structure, to be verified,
modified or superseded as and when other information becomes available.

There is, however, a utilitarian aspect of such determinations which makes it desirable
to standardise certain data for use in technical and industrial work. The international
photometric scale which governs the output of large industries concerned with the
production of illuminants, necessitates the elevation of some particular set of visibility
data to the dignity of a standard, to be used universally in all computations carried
out for technical purposes. Such standards do not necessarily stand for all time, but
remain fixed until such time as they may be altered by the decision of properly repre-
sentative bodies in the light of such new information as may have accrued since the
