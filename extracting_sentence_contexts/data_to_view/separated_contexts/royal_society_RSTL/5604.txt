a And to him is due the important theorem, that the Bezoutiant is an invariant of the
two quantics of the order m and of the adjoint quantic (., v, . .Xy, —2)"?, being in
fact a linear function with mere numerical coefficients, of the invariants called Cobe-
zoutiants, and in like manner that the Bezoutoid is an invariant of the single quantic
of the order 12 and of the adjoint quantic (#. v, . .Xy, —&)”>?, being a linear function
with mere numerical coefficients of the invariants called Cobezoutoids. The modes of generation of a covariant are infinite in number, and it is to be antici-
pated that, as new theories arise, there will be frequent occasion to consider new Ppro-
cesses of derivation, and to single out and to define and give names to new covariants.
