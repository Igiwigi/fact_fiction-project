Plants on land watered two days previously were plentifully
covered with dew, but I could walk through two or three fields ere my clothes were
fully saturated. Wheat irrigated three or four days previously, and bordering the
fields above noticed, had dew on it, but not sufficient to wet me through. Such rela-
tive states of moisture in adjoining fields seem to establish the fact of the local charac-
ter of dews. Aqueous vapour would appear to have been taken up by the action of
the sun during the day, suspended over the spot, and deposited at night as dew on
the land in proportion to the supply yielded by day, or the different lands radiated
their heat in a different manner. My tents were within 200 yards of the fields where
I observyed these phenomena ; but from the 11th to the 30th of January there was not
any deposition of dew abont them, excepting on the 13th of January only, and the
dewing-point was but once within 45 of the point of saturation.
