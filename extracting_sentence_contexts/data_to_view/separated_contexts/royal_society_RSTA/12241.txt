Here the curl of B is represented by the interfacial discontinuity in the tangential
induction, or

Also the tangential component of Ry is mz/4mp,7°. Therefore the repulsion is

as before, equation (203). This method (207) is analogous to (204).

§37, There are several other ways of representing the attraction, employing fictitious
matter and current ; but now let us change the method, and observe how the attrac-
tion between the magnetic pole and the iron mass is accounted for by a stress dis-
tribution, and its space-variation. The best stress is the third, equation (188), § 31. Applying this, we have simply a tension of magnitude 4y,R,? = T, in the first medium

and 4y,R,’=T, in the second, parallel to R, and R, respectively, each combined
with an equal lateral pressure, so that the tensor of the stress vector is constant.
