Several interesting points may be noted in Table VI. The type of growth produced
is independent of the branching of the fragment ; the number of fragments producing
DH, was considerably greater than the number producing DH,; a mixed growth
of DH, and DH, occurred on three occasions, including once from an unbranched
hyphal tip which possibly indicates the presence of a mixture of DH, and DH, characters
at one point in the same hypha; a considerable number of fragments failed to grow.
There is some indication that the mortality is greatest among fragments with one or
no branch and least among the much-branched ones.

A selection of the drawings showing the position in the hyphe of the fragments
developing into DH, and DH, is given in fig. 3.

Fig. 3 reveals the remarkable facts that DH, and DHy may develop from different
minor branches of the same hypha or even from contiguous fragments of one hypha.
It may also be seen that those fragments which developed into DH, usually included
the extreme tip of a hypha, but there was no very marked consistency in the position
of fragments giving one strain or the other, since DH, also grew from the tip of a hypha
and DH, on a few occasions from the region behind the tip.

A slightly modified method was adopted in a further series of experiments. The
culture of DH, was prepared on a slide as before and the hyphal tip was cut off. Instead
of removing the severed tip, however, this was left to grow on the slide, while the whole
of the rest of the mycelium was transferred to a plate of standard medium as a control.
Tt was thus possible accurately to sketch the severed tip under a high magnification
by means of a camera lucida, and to measure it from time to time, while avoiding any
