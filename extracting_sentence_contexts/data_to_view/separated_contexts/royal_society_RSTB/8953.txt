Introduction

Action control is essential to the daily routines of life, being an integral part of
everyday activities from getting dressed to making pancakes. Yet, in our effort
George Kachergis to distill cognitive processes in the laboratory, our controlled experiments often
e-mail: george.kachergis@gmail.com remove many of the interesting aspects of voluntary action. Although arbitrary
stimulus—response experiments have in fact granted many insights into basic cog-
nitive mechanisms of perception, learning and decision-making, as engineers
endeavour to build humanoid robots to accomplish everyday cooking and clean-
ing tasks [1], the field of cognitive psychology seemingly has embarrassingly little
advice to offer (for a review, see [2]). Despite early interest in how an action pre-
cipitates from thinking of its to-be-achieved effects, or goal [3], the more
mainstream sensorimotor paradigm investigates the reverse: stimuli-driven per-
ception resulting in action. From the sensorimotor perspective [4,5], the
stimulus is seen as the driving force behind the subsequent selection, preparation,
planning and execution of an action.
