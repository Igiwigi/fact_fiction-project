(b) Effect of EDF order

As shown in previous sections, in practice and on standard first-order stencils, only the addition
of off-diagonal components of the third-order Hermite coefficients affects the NS-level dynamics.
The addition of fourth-order components of the EDF, however, while not affecting the NS-level
terms can improve the stability domain of the scheme [50,62]. To that end, the linear stability
domains of the SRT collision operator with different orders of the EDF were evaluated. The results
(maximum achievable non-dimensional velocities and Mach numbers) are shown in figure 2. As
expected from the LB development and continuum error analysis, at 6* = 1, the solver exhibits
a much wider usability domain (in terms of non-dimensional viscosity). It is also interesting
to note that the maximum achievable Mach number/non-dimensional velocity is reached at
0.65 < 0 < 0.85. This can in part be justified by the fact that for @* <1, temperature deviation
affects the behaviour of the numerical solver in the form of hyperviscosity, while 6* > 1 results
