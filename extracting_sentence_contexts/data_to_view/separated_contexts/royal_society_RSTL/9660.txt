20, in which the vessels composing the

bundle have increased to 38 in number, the last formed ones, a', being much smaller in
8ize than those which immediately preceded them. The first formed ones, Â«, have, in
this instance, become accidentally detached from the inner bark cylinder, which is a
rather unusnal occurrence. The illustrations I have given will, I think, demonstrate the fact that we have in each
of these rootlets a single vascular bundle that commences its development eccentrically
in relation to the centre of the rootlet to which it belongs, and that, proceeding from
this one pole, it is developed centripetally, the extent of that development, including
the number of its constituent vessels, bearing a general relation to the age of the

rootlet 80 far as is indicated by its 8ize. Excepting in the magnitude of its liber-cells,
the rezemblance to the corresponding organs in the Selaginellee is complete. Seeing
that this peculiar structure only exists in the recent Lycopods and Ophioglossee, and
that no other resemblance exists between the fossil Lepidodendra and Sigillarie and
the Ophioglossec, we must fall back upon the Lycopods as the plants with which this
form of rootlet indicates true affinities On forwarding characteristic specimens of
these rootlets to M. Vax TreGne he at once replied, expressing his conviction that
they belonged to a Lycopodiaceons plant.
