Figure 18. Output versus input duty cycle of the perceptron with and without compensation. (Online version in colour.)

The observed reduction of operational range and loss of linearity in the voltage to PWM :8
converter are caused by the fact that the voltage DCsum powers the voltage to PWM converter. ae
When the input duty cycle is above 70%, DCsum is below 30% of Vag. For Vaq = 2.5V this is below : &
the threshold voltage. And in this case the NMOS transistors of the ring oscillator are always off, : ~
and the output stops oscillating. In other words, there is a mismatch between the voltage ranges 7
of the two parts of the perceptron. The output voltage range of the PWM weighted addition VAC ae
is from 0 V to 2.5 V (figure 5); and the input voltage range of the voltage to PWM converter is from [3
0.7 V to 2.3V (figure 16). :s

We may limit the range of the output voltage of the PWM weighted addition VAC. This can :
be done by adding a small glue logic between the two blocks of the perceptron. This may consist
of no more than a compensation PMOS transistor, whose gate and drain are connected to the
capacitor as shown in figure 10. In this case, when the voltage on the capacitor goes below the
threshold, the PMOS starts charging this capacitor, and when the voltage is above the threshold,
