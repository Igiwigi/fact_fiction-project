Present results add to evidence by Gobel et al. [41] to
suggest that exposure to picture books is one factor that can
provide the kind of experience that induces the early start of
spatial biases [8,26,31]. It is noteworthy that, in the present

from a very early age [35], showing them the pictures, pointing
