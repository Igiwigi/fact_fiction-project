A further extension was discovered by Hess (1876, p. 15), who allowed for faces of several
kinds and for the possibility of an ‘overhanging’ edge, where the dihedral angle does not
enclose the centre of the polyhedron. Of the two faces meeting at an overhanging edge, it
is natural to regard the outer one as being ‘retrograde’, so that its penetration counts for

-1 in the computation of d. In fact, the appropriate generalization is

La —Xb+ Ue = 2d, (6-1)

where a is the density of the vertex figure (which can be zero if it does not enclose the
circumcentre), » (for each edge) is 1 or 0 according as the edge is ordinary or overhanging,
cis the density of a face (with a minus sign if the face is retrograde), and d is the total density
(counting as many as three intersections for penetration of the innermost core of an
octagram {3} or a decagram {/3'}) (Briickner 1g00, p. 165). Since we are dealing only with
polyhedra whose vertices are all alike, the first term La can always be replaced by aN). The foregoing conventions ensure that the total density d is the same as the ‘area’ d of the
basic Schwarz triangle, in nearly every case (but see the remarks in § 9 and the end of § 10).

For instance, the *quasi-rhombicuboctahedron’ r te derived from the Schwarz triangle
(2 3 4), has 24 vertices, 24 ordinary edges, 24 overhanging edges, 18 squares, 8 retrograde
triangles, and satisfies the formula as follows:

7. ‘THE REGULAR AND QUASI-REGULAR POLYHEDRA /|qr

Let us define a quasi-regular polyhedron as consisting of regular polygons of two kinds, say
{g}’s and {7}’s, each entirely surrounded by specimens of the other kind (Coxeter & Whitrow
1950, p. 422).
