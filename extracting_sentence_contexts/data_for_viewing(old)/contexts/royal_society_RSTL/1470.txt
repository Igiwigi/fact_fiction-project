Dr. Hosack's Observalions on Vision. 215

observes, of the sight becoming gradually better for several
months after the operation.

When we have been long out of the habit of combining our
muscles in almost any one action of life, as walking, dan-
cing, or playing upon a musical instrument, we in a great
measure lose the combination, and find a difficulty in recover-
ing it, in proportion to the length of time we had been de-
prived of it; but the individual action of each muscle remains
as before. Thus, probably, with the muscles of the eye. A
variety of facts of a similar nature must present themselves to
every person conversant in the science of optics, which may
admit of a similar explanation.

I have thus endeavoured, first, to point out the limited action
of the iris, and of consequence the insufficiency of this action
for explaining vision. Secondly, to prove that the lens
possesses no power of changing its form to the different dis-
tances of objects. Thirdly, that to see objects at different
distances, corresponding changes of distance should be pro-
duced between the retina and the anterior part of the eye, as
also in the refracting powers of the media through which. the
rays of light are to pass. And, fourthly, that the combined
