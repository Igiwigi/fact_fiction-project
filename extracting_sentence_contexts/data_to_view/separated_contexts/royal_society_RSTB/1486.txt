The decussation of the pyramid is thus not confined to the upper cervical region, but,
as one would expect, is gradually taking place during the descent of the pyramid
through the bulbar segments. As has already been seen, the majority of the fibres
decussate ; a few, however, and this is notably the case in the quadrigeminal region,
appear to remain on the same side. This again accords with the fact that there are
also direct and crossed paths to the motor centres of the cord.
