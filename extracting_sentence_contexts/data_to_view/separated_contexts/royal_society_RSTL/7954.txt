CLELAND ON THE VARIATIONS OF THE HUMAN SKULL. 125

and in two to 5'3; in the remainder it varies from 4-9 to 5'2, while we have already
seen that in the child ten years old it reaches 5:1. It appears from this that the addi-
tional growth by which the base-line in the male comes to exceed that found in the
female takes place after the age mentioned. Tt might therefore be naturally supposed,
as occurred to the writer, that the facts which have now been detailed are mere results
of greater development of the frontal sinus in the adult male than in the female and
child, and in the savage than in civilized races ; but this is not the case; for we shall
find that though development of the frontal sinus does add to the base-line, growth of
the base of the 8kull from the front of the foramen magnum forwards to the level of the
foramina optica plays a much greater part in the addition which takes place. Regions of the base.—According to the system of measurement pursned in the present
inquiry, the base of the skull is represented by three lines, the middle one of which, the
foramino-optic line, corresponds pretty nearly with the * basicranial axis* of HuxLey ;
while the hindmost displays the length of the foramen magnum, and the foremost the
length of the orbit ; the length of the base-line varying according to the length of these
distances, and the angles at which they are placed one to another. Foramen magnum (General Table, column 25),—This is the region of the base which
presents least characteristic variation in length.
