At any rate, I never find them
elsewhere. It is a well-known and very popular view that the Leguminose enrich the soil in
nitrogenous substances. There is no doubt that the plants of this natural order
contain abundance of nitrogenous substances, and it is a fact that the roots of our
ordinary field and garden Papilionacese go deep, and thus bring up nitrogenous
compounds from below to enrich the surface soil when the plants are turned into
it by the spade or plough. It is also unquestionable that the root-tubercles which
have been described above are extraordinarily rich in nitrogenous substauces. Apart
from the evidence already given, analyses of the tubercles of the Lupin show an
enormous excess of proteids as compared with the other parts of the roots,* and, since
these tubercles are aptt to be on the upper portions of the root, it is not improbable
that these circumstances have contributed to the views so favourable among agricul-
turists.
