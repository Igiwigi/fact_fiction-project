APPENDIX 2. ANALOGIES FOR THE HODOGRAPH THEORY

The key facts of this paper are (i) that the transformation (2-1) has a branch locus which
is characteristic for the hodograph equation, and (i1) that the function ©, defined in (4-19)
has an analytic continuation which is single valued for 0<q<1 and all real ¢. Neither of
these properties is a priori at all evident, so it will be of interest to indicate briefly the con-
siderations leading to the choice of the formulae (2-1) and (4-19) as starting-points.

The leading idea is that the attack on the hodograph equation should be guided by the
prior study of simpler but analogous equations. One such equation is obtained from the
hodograph equation (1-1) by putting

2aq=t (A1)
and letting « become infinite, with ¢ held fixed. This gives
