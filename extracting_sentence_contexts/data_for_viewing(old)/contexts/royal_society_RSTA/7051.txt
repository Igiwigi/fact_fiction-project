make brief comments on an iterative method, for use with Volterra’s equation, analogous
to that described in § 6 and employed on Fredholm’s equation.

18. A CLASSICAL ITERATIVE METHOD

For the solution of the integral equation (56) Friedlander used an iterative method, given
by the relations

He evaluated f(x) analytically, and computed f, f® and f by numerical integration,
taking f(x) as an acceptable solution of the integral equation. In fact, his errors in the

fourth decimal, at x = 1, 2, 3 and 4, are 4, 5, 13 and 25 units respectively. The labour of
this method is somewhat excessive, and it is clear that the order of iterate necessary to give
accurate results is likely to increase with x. This process is therefore less satisfactory than in
the case of Fredholm’s equation, though again the Aitken extrapolation method and the
Euler transformation can be used to accelerate convergence. For example, using an interval
h = 4, we find at x = 1-0 the following values of the first four iterates: 0-11111, 0-05849,
