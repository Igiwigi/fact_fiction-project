3. Whoever reads the passages here quoted, and knows
not what was done on the subject before Mr. LanDex handled
it, will undoubtedly conceive that he was the first person who
solved the problem of computing the difference between the length
of the infinite arch of an hyperbola and its asymptote. Yet the
fact is not 80. That difference may be computed, im many
cases, by the first series given by Mr. MacLavkin in Art. 808
of his Treatise of Fluzions, which series admits of an easy
transformation into another form, by which the aforesaid dif-
ference may be computed in all cases; or the fluent may be

taken in a series which will always converge ; and both he
and Mr. SimesoN have actually produced such a series, the
one in the place before referred to, and the other in Art. 435
of his Doctrine of Fluzions. And although this series, when
