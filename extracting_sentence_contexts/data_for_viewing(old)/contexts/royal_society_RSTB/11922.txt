ment (e.g. investing in college tuition versus providing treats)
or to potential competing recipients, however. Our hypothesis
highlights the critical need for more data that address invest-
ment decisions being made by men in a given context to
define (i) the level, nature and timing of investment (e.g. trivial
investments such as giving treats); (ii) the effects of given
investments on children; and (iii) interests conflicting with
investment in a particular child. Indeed, the life cycle of a
male, regardless of society, must also shift the costs and
benefits of investing in different categories of kin as a man
moves through phases of adolescence, marriage, and father-
hood (e.g. [70,164]). Recasting paternal investment decisions
as the ‘matrilineal puzzle’ obscures the fact that similar
decisions are simply being made in different contexts. Thus,
the ‘matrilineal puzzle’ may be resolved if researchers investi-
gated investment patterns in more detail in individual
societies—rather than assuming ‘matriliny’ always entails a
certain set of behaviours.

We have intentionally disregarded the complexity of
decisions that males and females make in relation to each
other across different socio-ecologies [69] and have thereby
presented what is undoubtedly an overly simplistic character-
ization of men as ‘expendable’ where there efforts are limited,
inconsistent, unnecessary, substitutable, or applied to mating
