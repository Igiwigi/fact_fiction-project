the central hypoglossal and peripheral facial, and in the other, end to side, the
peripheral facial being stitched into the gap made by dividing the hypoglossal.

Thus there are two points here for comparison, on the one hand between
a spino-facial and a hypoglosso-facial anastomosis, and on the other hand between
an end to end and an end to side.

a. Results in Spino-facial and Hypoglosso-facial Anastomoses compared.—In the
first place, to take the question of spinal accessory or hypoglossal. The first sign of
returning voluntary or reflex power in the face was in 105 and 90 days respectively
in the two spino-facial experiments, and in 84 and 45 days in the two hypoglosso-
facial, or an average of 97 and 64 days respectively. In one of the spino-facial
dogs the nerve was found to be regenerated, as shown by the fact that the galvanic
current evoked contractions in the muscles when the electrode was placed over the
spino-facial junction and the nerve stimulated through the skin, this being at 60 days,
but there were no voluntary movements. Somewhat earlier, namely, 47 days, the
hypoglosso-facial corresponding dog, 7.¢., the end to side, was found to be regenerated
and movements were evoked in the orbicularis by the faradic current applied at
the junction and the nerve likewise stimulated through the skin. Two days before
that examination the movements seen were judged to be voluntary or reflex, but the
electrical reaction was not tested, but the evidence of the faradic current two days
later confirmed the opinion that these contractions were really the first evidence of
restoration of movements actually caused by regeneration.

It is thus seen that the hypoglossal gave an earlier start, which worked out
