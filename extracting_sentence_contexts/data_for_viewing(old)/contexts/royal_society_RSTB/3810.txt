fossil Abietinean forms, too, they are not abundant, and have only been recorded in old
wood. The ray tracheid is a structure which is considered by Jerrrey to have made
the pines the dominant group of the Conifers to-day,* one which if ever acquired would
certainly seem to be too advantageous to be readily lost. If the Araucarines are
derived from the Abietinez, the absence of ray tracheids can be accounted for by
either of two views; that they came off from the Abietinese before these had
acquired ray tracheids, or that they once had them in their ancestry and have lost
them. Their absence may thus be either palingenetic or cenogenetic. The oldest form
with ray tracheids is from the Cretaceous, and since the first Araucarian appeared
long before this, the absence of ray tracheids in the Araucarinere must be
palingenetic. When the thin and unpitted character of the walls of the ray cells
is also taken into account, it is evident that the ray cells are of primitive type.
In fact they are identical with the Cordaitean and much more primitive than those
of the Abietinez.

7. Bast anp PERIDERM.

The bast in Agathis and Araucaria, according to SrraspurGER (1891, IIT), has no
albuminous cells associated with the rays. These he considers as the counterparts in
the bast of the ray tracheids in the wood, and finds that in exceptional cases only are
they not continuous with ray tracheids. Some of these cases have been explained by
the fact that the ray tracheids which were ancestrally present have been lost.f The
absence of the marginal medullary ray cells from the bast of the Araucarinew (and
Taxiner), STRASBURGER (1891, III, pp. 92-93) considers evidence of their primitive
structure. It is certainly almost in the nature of a demonstration that these forms
