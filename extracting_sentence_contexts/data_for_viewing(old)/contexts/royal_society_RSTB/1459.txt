8 according to the experiments of Lupwie and ALEXANDER Scumipt (ALEX. SCHMIDT,
& ‘Ber. ttber die Verhandl. der Siichs. Ges, der Wissensch. zu Leipzig, Math. phys.
§ Classe,’ vol. 19, p. 99, 1867), the blood of animals, which have died of suffocation,
contains only traces of oxygen or none at all, whilst it contains reducing substances in
large quantities. Aranasstew (N, Aranasstew, ‘ Ber. der Siichs. Ges. der Wissen-
- sch.,’ vol. 24, p. 253, 1872) showed later that these reducing substances could only be
found in the corpuscles and none at all in the serum.

It would appear that these reducing substances are normally seized by the blood
corpuscles, and by them immediately oxidised, but failure to supply oxygen caused
them to be stored up in the bodies of the corpuscles,

: The inability of the blood to oxidise substances is again argued from the fact that
certain easily oxidisable substances pass through the blood and are excreted in the
urine unchanged. It is quite possible that such substances are amongst those not
