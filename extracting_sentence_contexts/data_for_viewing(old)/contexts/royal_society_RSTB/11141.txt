Nevertheless, numerosity discrimination has been demon-
strated in vertebrates that lack the mammalian neocortex (see
Agrillo & Bisazza [4]). In fact, it seems highly unlikely that
the architectural plan of the vertebrate brain is necessary for
basic numerical cognition; cuttlefish, for example, have
recently been claimed to discriminate prey items on the basis
of numerosity [5]

Contrary to the notion that numerical cognition is a com-
plex, higher cortical function, theoretical studies indicate that
numerical discrimination requires no more than a classifier
and a threshold mechanism [6], which can be implemented
by known neural circuits ([7]; see also Rose [8]). The extent to
which such mechanisms can explain numerical cognition
