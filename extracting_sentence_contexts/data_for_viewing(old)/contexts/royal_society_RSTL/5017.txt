frequent intervals and intimately, the intestine to the integument, and consequently
limiting, almost obliterating the peritoneal cavity. This cavity however does exist,
and contains a viscid colourless fluid, bearing spherical, nucleated and granular
cells (fig. 22), intermingled with pellucid cellules, which appear only to represent
the immature phase of the former. These corpuscles seem to me to be the bodies
which Mr, Wnarron Joxss has mistaken for those supposed to exist in the blood-
proper#*. The fluid of the peritoneal cavity is of almost momentary importance to life
in the Earth-worm. Kept in a perfectly dry atmosphere even for an hour it dies.
It cannot be revived; and is covered by a slimy fluid which appears as if it were
that of the peritoneal cavity exuded. In the adult state in this worm the system of
the blood-proper js highly developed ; a circumstance which explains the diminished
proportion of the chylaqueous fluid. That the basis of this latter fluid consists of
water, I infer from the immediate importance of moisture to life, The fact of its
exixtence, and next that of its physiological importance, are quite proved by the

resu]ts of observation on the young Earth-worm (fig. 23). In the early stage of
development the peritoneal fluid in this worm is, relatively, considerable in quantity.
In the infancy of this Annelid it fulfils those functions which during adalt life are
discharged by the true-blood. The peritoneal fluid in the young abounds in spindle-
