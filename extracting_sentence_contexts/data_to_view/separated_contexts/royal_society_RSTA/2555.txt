Even more amazing is his 1821 paper on Padé =

Cauchy’s claim clamorously fails already in the first non-trivial case m = 1, n = 2.

e It seems that the record is set by the failed attempts to prove Fermat's last theorem. There were thousands of such wrong or defective proofs, many of them published. A
person of no smaller status than von Lindemann has between 1901 and 1909 published
three fallacious proofs of Fermat's last theorem [11].
