21. The type specimens of this species are fragments of the anterior parts of the upper
and lower jaws of a young individual, were originally described as the milk teeth of
Paraceratherium bugtiense (Forster-Coorrer, 1924). Apart from the fact that the
milk dentition of this species is now fully known, the specimens appear not to be milk,
but permanent, teeth. The anterior tooth in the lower jaw, although fully out of the
gum, is absolutely untouched by wear, and is therefore unlikely to be the first premolar,
fig. 21, A. There is a small depressed area just in front of the leading tooth which may
have held the first premolar, but no trace of sockets is visible, and whether or not this
tooth was ever present is doubtful.
