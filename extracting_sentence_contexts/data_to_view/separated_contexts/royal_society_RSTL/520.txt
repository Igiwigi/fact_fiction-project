Thad at that
time no expectation that I could myself pursue this subject
farther to any useful purpose, having little prospect of residing
for a sufficient length of time in view of the sea, and seeing no
other method by which the same end might be accomplished. I have, however, since that time, found means to satisfy myself,
by observations'over the'surface of the Thames, that although

_ the quantity of refraction varies in general with any change of

the thermometer or hygrometer, yet the law of these variations
is not altogether $0 simple as I had hoped it might be found. I shall, on the present occasion, first relate the facts on which
this opinion is founded, and which are in themselves sufficiently
remarkable, on account of the unexpected quantity of refraction
observable over a short extent of water; I shall, in the next
place, shew that the exact determination of the concurrent
changes of the atmosphere are of less value; and their irregu-
larities of less consequence, than I had conceived, as there is a
very easy method whereby the quantity of dip at sea may be at
any time correctly measured; and therefore the end which I
sought by indirect means, may be at once directly attained. The first instance that occurred to me, of observable refraction
over the surface of the Thames, was wholly accidental. I was
sitting in a boat near Chelsea, in such a position that my eye
was elevated about half a yard from the surface of the water,
and had a view over its surface, that probably somewhat ex-
ceeded a mile in length, when I remarked that the oars of
several barges at a distance, that were then coming up with the
tide, appeared bent in various degrees, according to their dis-
tance from me.
