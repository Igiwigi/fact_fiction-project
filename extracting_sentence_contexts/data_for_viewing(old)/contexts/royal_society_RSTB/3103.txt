In most cases these indirect divisions were curious forms which may be regarded
as transitional between mitosis and amitosis (figs. 25, 0 and p, 26, 0, p, and q).

The most usual type of direct division seems to be that the nucleus divides
directly, for nuclei with two nucleoli are very abundant, the nucleoli being either
close together (as if they had just separated from one another), or at varying
distances apart and of the same or different sizes. Usually each is surrounded by
a clear zone. There is apparently no connection between the shape of the nucleus
and the number of nucleoli. The nucleoplasm becomes constricted in the middle,
and the two halves thus formed gradually move away from one another, sometimes
sliding over one another (26,7). The resulting nuclei may be of the same or different
sizes, and they may have a definite membrane or, more usually, no definite outline,
but extend into processes resembling pseudo-podia (25, 2, 1, 26, a, b). In fact, the
nuclei very often closely resemble amoeboid organisms. In many cases the nuclei of
the two daughter cells begin to divide again before any cell division takes place, so
that in one cell there may be (as in fig. 25, m) one nucleus with two nucleoli
while the other has partly or completely divided into two grand-daughter nuclei.

In some cases a nucleus with four nucleoli may divide into two halves, each with
a couple of nucleoli of the same or different sizes (26, h, /, ). Other cases occur in
which there are three or more nucleoli, up to as many as six or eight or even more,
but the higher numbers are comparatively infrequent (26, m). When a number of
nucleoli are arranged along the middle of an elongated nucleus (as in fig. 25, 0, Â»)
the appearance suggests the spindle of a nucleus which is dividing karyokinetically.
