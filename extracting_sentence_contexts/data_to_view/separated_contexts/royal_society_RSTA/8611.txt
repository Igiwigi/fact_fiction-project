FUNDAMENTAL FORMULATIONS OF ELECTRODYNAMICS. 225

This last remark points to the possibility of obtaining an elementary deduction of
the expression

for the complete electromotive forcive simply by calculating »the rate of change of
intrinsic energy of a moving bi-pole, and the calculation has in fact been carried out
by Larmor,* taking however a parallel plate condenser with equal and oppositely
charged plates, moving in a uniform magnetic field. An’analogous argument in the magnetic case will give a deduction of the magneto-

9. We have stated that the magnetic energy expressions just obtained are
effectively equivalent to those usually derived, whereas as a matter of fact this is true
only of the final result ; the various formule employed in the derivation of this result
are not in their usual form but it has been shown elsewhere? that they are consistent
with the complete dynamical theory, the more usual formule and the various
modifications of them which have from time to time been suggested being all
inadmissible on this score. A complete discussion of the justification for this last
statement is necessarily beyond the scope of the present paper, but it may perhaps
serve a useful purpose if a brief outline of some of the more important reasons is
given, especially as they have some bearing on points raised elsewhere in the present
discussion. In the first place there is probably little or no dittculty in seeing the fallacy in the
usual and simplest form of the theory wherein the expression «H?/87 for the magnetic
energy density is derived in the statical theory as potential energy and in the
dynamical theory as kinetic energy: we need only enquire as to the type of energy
represented by the same expression when the field is due in part to rigid magnets
and in part to steady currents.
