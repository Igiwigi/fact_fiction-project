For the sake of brevity, we consider in the following unbiased
and frequency-dependent selection only. The first step of the inference framework is the develop-
ment of the generative model. To make use of all available
archaeological information, we used a simulation approach
that accounted for the fact that the observed frequencies
describe a sample and not the population of pottery types. Starting from observed data, the absolute frequencies
D(t)) = [1,..., 1] of k different variant types in the sample
of size n(t;) at the beginning of the phase, t;, we generated a
population of cultural variants P(f;) = [R1,..., Rk, Reyi] from
which the sample could have been drawn at random using
the Dirichlet distribution approach [71]. The variables R; rep-
resent the absolute frequency of variant type i in the
population.
