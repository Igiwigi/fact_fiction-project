material, namely, 3-4g./c.c. of silver bromide and 0-54Â¢./c.c. of gelatin. In calculating

these curves, the range-velocity relations for light recoils were taken from the data of Knipp

& Teller (1941), and the following figures were adopted for the mean mass, charge, and
initial energy of the fission fragments:

M=120, z=45, E=80MeV.

In general, the theoretical curves lie above the experimental values, in accordance with the

fact that the theory does not take into account screening effects. The existence of maxima

in the graphs is due to the lower limit of acceptance of particle ranges; as is well known, if

this limit is reduced to zero, the formulae for the collision cross-sections become divergent.

The total abundance of recoils of the two types was also determined. In 2400 fission tracks

~ observed, 83 heavy recoils were found, corresponding to an abundance of 1 in (29+3)

S tracks. Forty-three light recoils were found, corresponding to an abundance of | in (56+5)

g tracks. Similar observations were carried out in a plate which was fully sensitive to a-particles
