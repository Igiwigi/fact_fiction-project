some intermediate reaction, such as
K + Cl, —> KCl + Cl

or thelike. Insuch a case the value of the heat available may be quite different from that
given by the end products. It is impossible to make any precise statements where
the data are so indefinite, but I feel that when all these factors are taken into account
the value of T given by the experiments on chlorine is a reasonable one.

This position is strongly supported when the value given by COCI, is compared with
that given by Cl,. It is most likely that the mechanism of the reaction is much the
same in both cases, any difference arising mainly from the fact that the Cl, is now
loaded up with the CO group. This would have two effects. It would reduce the
total amount of energy available by the difference of the heats of formation of CO and
COCI,, i.e., by 18 x 10° gm. cals. for each gramme molecule of COCI,, and it would

increase by two the number of atoms among which the energy is divisible. Let us
consider a supposititious case in order to see what the effect of these differences will be.
If we assume 6 as a reasonable number of atoms, including electrons as a special kind
of atom, to be concerned in the reaction which emits an electron in the case of chlorine,
there will be two more, or eight, in the case of COCI,. Six atoms in the case of Cl,
