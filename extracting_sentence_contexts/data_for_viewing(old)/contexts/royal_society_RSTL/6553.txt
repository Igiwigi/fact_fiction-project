which the instrument was started) being the origin.

In like manner, it is equally easy to find the point of the curve corresponding to any
given time.

The accuracy of this process depends, however, it will be seen, on the assumption that
the time-scale is constant for the different portions of a curve; and the following is a
proof that this is strictly true.

It will be noticed shortly that this system of measurement has brought out a remark-
able correspondence between the peaks and hollows of the horizontal force and those
of the vertical force, which may be aid to have failed in no one instance. This may be
received as sufficient evidence, not only of the physical fact brought to light, but also of
the constancy of the time-scale, in absence of which no such phenomenon could haye
been observyed.

11. The following Table exhibits the results derived from comparing together the
peaks and hollows of the declination, with those occurring at the same instant of time
in the horizontal force.

When peak and peak occur together, or hollow and hollow, this is termed a corre-
spondence, the reverse a non-correspondence.
