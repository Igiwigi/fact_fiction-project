equations of motion of the molecules. In the case commonly considered the only
known integral is the energy, and hence F, and F, are taken to be functions of the
energies E, and E,.

Condition (ii.), combined with the fact that the sum of the energies is unaltered by
an encounter, then leads us to the well-known forms

But if the field is symmetrical about the axis of z, and T,, 1, are the angular
momenta of the molecules about this axis, we also know that—

(a) In the absence of an encounter I’, and T, are constant ;

(b) The total angular momentum is unaltered by encounters, so that the values
before and after an encounter satisfy the relation T, +1, = T+ Ty’.
