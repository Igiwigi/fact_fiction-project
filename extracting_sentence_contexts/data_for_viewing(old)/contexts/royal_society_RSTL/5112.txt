But the operations are different in general; for i?=—1 always, but (Da.)?, as has been shown above, is not
equiyalent to —1, except when performed on lines at right angles to a.

There is one difficulty, I confess, I cannot get over in Sir W. HamrLTon's Theory, no doubt from some
misconception on my part, or from taking too narrow a view of the meaning of the sign /=1. The difficulty
I allude to consists in this. Sir W, HantLrox assumes 4, 7, k not only to be particular values of /=1, but
also absolute directions (i, e. units of direction) : in short he uses 3, j, k in the zame 8ense as a, Þ, y above, and in
the same sense also as (Da.), (DP.), (Dy.). Now my difficulty arises from my not being able to see how
particular values of /—T can denote anything (geometrically) but change of direction, or to perceive, that
they can be used with propriety as symbols of those rectangular units of direction.

However this may be, it is important to explain the fact, that, in the results to which I have been led by
the conception of translation, there are no general relations corresponding to

#=—1l, P=—1l, R=—1.
In my method, «, Þ, y are simple units of direction and nothing more; and instead of the relations just put
down, I have been led, by the conception of translation, to the following, viz.—
a.a=0, Þ.Þ=0, y.y=0
«xazl, Bxb=1, yxy=1;
though, as regards the last three relations, all that I have a right to assert as a matter of necessity is, that
axa=zſxS=yxy.

(Da.)?=—1, (DB.»)=—1, (Dy.Y==1,
but only when performed on lines at right angles to @, Þ, y respectively.
