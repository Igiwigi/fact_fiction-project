Indeed, given also that we are unaware of

even a single study specifically aimed at examining the existence
of ape ritual (which we encourage all readers to perform), a
minimal definition like ours is arguably the kind of liberal
approach that is most useful to start any investigation into a
new phenomenon. Once ape ritual is found using this minimal
definition, further distinctions may then be introduced, but
until then, we surmise that a minimal definition serves its pur-
pose, if only to guide the research itself. Of course, our minimal
definition may instead also still prove too demanding (but, in
fact, we will relax our definition even more below, introducing
what we call proto-rituals).

3. Do apes have the necessary abilities for
spontaneous ritual? The goal of our paper is to examine whether apes have ritualâ€”
as a phylogenetic proxy for the LCA.
