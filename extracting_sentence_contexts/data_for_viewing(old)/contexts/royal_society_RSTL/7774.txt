62. I remark howeyer that the cubic scroll XXII or XXIII gives
0=54—(330—272)—2(a+x),

that is, A+3=—2, instead of a+x'=—8, The investigation is in fact really inappli-
cable to a scroll, for every point of a -scroll has the property of a flecnode; whence if
U=0 be the equation of the scroll, that of the fleenodal surface is M . U=0, containing
U as a factor, and there isnot any definite curve of intersection constituting the fleenodal
curye; but I am nevertheless surprised at the numerical contradiction.
