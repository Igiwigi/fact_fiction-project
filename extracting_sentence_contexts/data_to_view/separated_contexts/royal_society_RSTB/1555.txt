As previously
ataied, the inver or mesial portion of the anterior wall of each sac is attached by its
dorsal edge not only to the radial nodule, but also to the ventral surface of the tripus,
that is to say, to the root of its crescentie process, althongh tie latier has no traes of
the ventral ridge which usually marks the ingertion of these fibres in the normal
Siluridie. From this point outwards the fibres of the imiar stratum of the tunica
externa (fig, 81, ist.) in the anterior, antero-literal, und lateral or onter walls,
converge inthe dorsal wall towards the tripus, and eventually are inserted into the
miter quargin of the ereseentic process from its root to the pointed extremity of its
heel-like process. The fibres of the outer stratum of the tunica externa have au
almost exactly similar distribution and relation to the tripis, but pursue the usual
curvilinear course in passing from their insertion into tlhe crescenti¢ process to the
autero-lateral and lateral regions of the air-sac, The straight posterior margiv of the
cresventie protess appears to be free trom any special fibrous connection with the
wills of the sac, ab any rate it is certain that it dots not receive the insertion of any
of the converging fibres of the dorsal wall, and to this respect: the tripus of Cleras ts
suroswhat singniar, ‘Rhe reason for this mney possibly le in the fact that the
posterior margin of the process is almost coincident with the skeletal attachment of
the dorsal edge of the postertor wall of the aix-sae to the dorsal larsina. With regard to the ramaining Weberian ossicles we could detect no trace of an


id

jntercularinm, and the interossicular ligament was so short that the anterior
extremity of the tripus appeared to be almost in direct contact with the outer surface
of the spatulate process of the scaphium, The latter ossicle has the usual spatulate
and condylar processes, but no ascending process. We could find no trace of claustra,

As far as the grosser features in the structure of the auditory organ are concerned
we could detect no indication of retrogressive modification, A transverse ductus
endolymphaticus and a sinus endolymphaticus are present, and the latter structure
lms the usual relations to the cavum sinus imparis and the atrial cavities, The
closure of the external atrial aperture is effected in the usual manner by the spatulate
process of the scaphium.
