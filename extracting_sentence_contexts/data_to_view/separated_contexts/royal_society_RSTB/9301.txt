But, as been observed, forensic science is not simply rel-
evant to a trial; it is highly relevant to public confidence in
safety and in abating the fear of crime and crime reduction.

ing the accuracy or reliability of those results;

(d) the extent to which any material upon which the expert’s
opinion is based has been reviewed by others with rel-
evant expertise (for instance, in peer-reviewed
publications), and the views of those others on that
material;

(e) the extent to which the expert’s opinion is based
on material falling outside the expert’s own field of
expertise;

(f) the completeness of the information which was available
to the expert, and whether the expert took account of all
relevant information in arriving at the opinion (including
information as to the context of any facts to which the
opinion relates);

(g) if there is a range of expert opinion on the matter in ques-
tion, where in the range the expert’s own opinion lies and
whether the expert’s preference has been properly
explained; and

(h) whether the expert’s methods followed established prac-
tice in the field and, if they did not, whether the reason
for the divergence has been properly explained. In addition, in considering reliability, and especially the
reliability of expert scientific opinion, the court should be
astute to identify potential flaws which detract from its
reliability, such as:'°

(a) being based on a hypothesis which has not been subjec-
ted to sufficient scrutiny (including, where appropriate,
experimental or other testing), or which has failed to
stand up to scrutiny;

(b) being based on unjustifiable assumptions;

(c) being based on flawed data;

(d) relying on an examination, technique, method or process
which was not properly carried out or applied, or was
not appropriate for use in the particular case; or

(e) relying on an inference or conclusion which has not been
properly reached. Although there now appears to be common ground on
the basic principles between the scientific and legal commu-
nities, they are not always easy to apply in practice.
