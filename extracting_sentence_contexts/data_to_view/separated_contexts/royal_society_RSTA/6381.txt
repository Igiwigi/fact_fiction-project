We can see the influence of Lotka,
Odum and Pinkerton in this work, as well as the work that will come in the future. Many
contemporary scientists acknowledge this influence [24,27].

Although the MPP helps us understand the relation between energy and fitness in the
evolutionary process, an important criticism has been raised about it: Hall writes that ‘Odum
never really tested it, and, in fact, he said on occasion that, like natural selection, it was extremely
difficult if not impossible to test it directly’ [29]. Some scientists that followed Odum have
attempted to address this challenge. Nancy Harris, Charles Hall and Ariel Lugo, for example, did empirical surveys along an
elevational gradient in the Luquillo forest in Puerto Rico to test the MPP [30].
