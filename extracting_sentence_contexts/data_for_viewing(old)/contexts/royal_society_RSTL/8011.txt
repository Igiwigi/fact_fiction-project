refer to the principal points of difference; for the present it will suffice to say that in the
latter the greatest bending-moment falls nearly amidships, instead of in the after body as
before, notwithstanding the fact that at 80me parts of the middle body there is an excess of
weight. The amount of the greatest bending-moment when the ship is light is also
somewhat greater than that when he is fully laden ; and the curve MM in fig. 11 approx-
imates more nearly in form to that of the similarly marked curve for the © Minotaur”
(fig. 8) than it does in fig. 10, although striking points of difference still exist. Another
illustration of the variation in bending-moments which variation in the amount of the
weights on board a ship may produce is afforded by comparing figs. 10 & 12 (Plate XVII.);
and here we see also how, by reducing the excess of weight between the stations R' R* and
R* R*, we have rendered the curve MM in fig. 12 more nearly continuous in its concavity:
towards the axis than is the similar curve in fig. 11. The differences between these last
two curves have a special interest, on account of the fact that they are entirely due to
alterations in the s0wage of the weights on board, the total amount of weight carried
being the same in both cases. The greatest bending-moment in tig. 12 is found at the
station c &, and amounts to 13,800 foot-tons, or about one-eighth more than it is at the
corresponding station in fig. 11, this increase being due to the transposition of weights
to the extremities.

It may be well here to revert briefly to the fact that no ship having an excess of weight
over buoyancy at the extremities (as all, or nearly all, ships have) can sag throughout
her length when afloat in still water, although she may hog and not 82g. The cases of
the © Minotaur,” © Bellerophon,” and © Audacious” prove the possibility of the latter con-
dition, and no more need be said respecting it. That sagging alone cannot take place
