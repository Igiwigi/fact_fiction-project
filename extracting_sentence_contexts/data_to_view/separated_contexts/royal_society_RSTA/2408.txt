This luckily brought him to me in late 1980 when I had joined Daresbury as a staff scientist. I was
aware of the controversy and had learnt of the difficulties of anyone looking at the data in the
USA, for fear of harming their career. In fact, an Englishman who had done his PhD at Stanford
was at the EMBL in Hamburg at the time; he could have analysed the data but decided not to, as
he did not wish to rule out the possibility of working in the USA. Over the next nine months, I rigorously analysed the data using the most accurate curved
wave implementation of EXAFS theory where it took overnight computation on the best IBM
computer available at Daresbury (Daresbury was one of the major national computer centres at
the time) to complete a single iteration for a fraction of the XAFS data range. In May 1981,
had the result, which confirmed the original EXAFS structural parameters.
