growth rings characterise the Paleozoic forms. Even in the Triassic GorHan (1910,
p. 8) says that clearly defined growth rings are only exceptionally present.

In Cordaites the indications of growth rings that I have observed are of the same
type as the indeterminate ones of the Araucarinee. The most clearly marked that I
found was in a root (fig. 56, Plate 6) from the British Coal Measures. In an

~ Araucarioxylon species from the Cretaceous I have also found some poorly marked
growth rings (fig. 57, Plate 6) which seem to be of very irregular occurrence. In the
sporadic character of the growth ring in the Araucarinez there is thus a combination
of the features of the ancient forms and of the present day Conifers.* That the
growth rings in the Araucarinew are in the process of acquirement seems to be
the natural inference from the observed facts.

The occurrence of tangential pitting on the summer wood of the annual ring is
stated by SrRAsBuRGER to characterise all Conifers which lack ray tracheids in their
medullary rays. The inverse statement has exceptions, in certain hard pines, where
STRASBURGER considers that the ray tracheids are so well developed that they have
replaced it functionally. That the tangential pitting has originated in the
Araucarinez in connection with the development of the growth rings is indicated by
some preliminary work that I have done, but further work is needed to establish this
