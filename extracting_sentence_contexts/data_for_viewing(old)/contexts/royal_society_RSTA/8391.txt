The value of & is much more likely to be near 3 than 4, so that in general the
assumption of a linear law of burning leads to an under calculation of maximum pressure.
To determine the effect on the calculated muzzle-velocity of adopting a mean linear

rate of burning is impossible without reference to a specific gun, but calculations for a
series of guns show that muzzle velocities, corresponding to the linear law, are found
to be considerably lower than those determined using an index law. These facts
illustrate the great importance of determining the burning law as accurately as possible
if correct ballistic predictions are to be made.

As regards propellants of other than constant burning surface shape, little can be done
to determine generally the effect on ballistics of variations in «, because of the complexity
of the formule, but particular calculations show that the above remarks hold good also
in this case.

The propellant characteristics are f the “force” and «, @, the constants in the rate of
