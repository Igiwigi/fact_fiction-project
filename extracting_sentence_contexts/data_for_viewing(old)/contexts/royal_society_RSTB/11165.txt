in our mind as an intellectual image of the set. Mental and
intellectual entities are more puzzling to us than physical
entities but less so than abstract entities. At least, we might
have cognitive access to mental or intellectual entities by
inner awareness and reflection.

The big problem for any version of mentalism is that only
finitely many brain states have actually been (or could be)
realized; hence, there are only finitely many mental represen-
tations or intellectual constructions. So the idea that numbers
are mental entities conflicts with the fact that for any finite
number, there is a yet greater number. Here is one way
in which we can know this fact: any cardinal number n is the
number of preceding numbers, as we start with zero; so
the number of numbers up to and including n is greater than n
by one.

(d) The set-size view

This is the view that cardinal numbers are sizes of sets. Set size
is a discrete magnitude; in other respects, it is much like length,
duration and weight (which we tend to think of as dense
and continuous magnitudes). The set-size view takes our pre-
theoretical thought and talk literally: ‘class size’ in normal
parlance refers to the number of pupils in a class, and ‘family
