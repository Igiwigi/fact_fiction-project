23. The results, â€”The values of log B, show a considerable amount of regularity,
and prove, I think conclusively, not only the existence of a critical velocity at which
eddies come in, but that it is proportional to the viscosity and inversely proportional
to the diameter of the tube.

The fact, however, that this relation has only been obtained by the utmost care to
reduce the internal disturbances in the water to a minimum must not be lost
8ight of.

The fact that the steady motion breaks down suddenly shows that the fluid is in a
state of instability for disturbances of the magnitude which cause it to break down.
But the fact that in some conditions ib will break down for a large disturbance, while
it is 8table for a smaller disturbance shows that there is a certain residual stability 80
long as the disturbances do not exceed a given amount.

The only idea that I had formed before commencing the experiments was that at
8ome critical velocity the motion must become unstable, 80 that any disburbance from
perfectly s8teady motion would result in eddies,

T had not been able to form any idea as to any particular form of disturbance heing
necezsary, But experience having shown the impossibility of obtaining absolutely
steady motion, T had not doubted but that appearance of eddies would be almost
simultaneous with the condition of instability. I had not, therefore, considered the
disturbances except to try and diminish them as much as possible. I had expected to
