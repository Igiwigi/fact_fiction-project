But the arrangement above described has been found to
work very well for comparing the mean specific heat from 70° C. to 100° C. with the
mean specific heat from 30° C. to 60° C., and will sufficiently illustrate the general
nature of the method. With a flow of 10 c.c. per second the heat-exchange amounts to about 300 calories
per second, and the external heat-loss with the arrangement above described can be
reduced to less than a tenth of a calorie per second, or about 1 in 3,000 of the total
quantity measured. Owing to the relatively small thermal capacity of the exchanger,
and to the fact that the distribution of temperature is nearly independent of the
flow, the conditions become steady to 0°°002 C. in a few minutes when the flow is
changed. The accuracy attainable depends chiefly on the limit of accuracy in reading
the thermometers. The Platinum Thermometers.
