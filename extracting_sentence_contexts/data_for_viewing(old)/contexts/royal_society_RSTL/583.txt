arrangement of bodies passing from a vitreous to a stony state,
which might have remained unobserved, if the desired homo-
geneity of the result had been obtained. Lshall now endeavour
to describe the various products of this operation; and I shall
also submit to your consideration, some remarks which appear
to me to arise naturally from the phenomena I have observed;
premising that, except where my opinions are supported by the
unequivocal demonstration of facts, I offer them with the utmost
deference to the decision of more experienced and judicious
mineralogists and geologists.

It may be proper to give a concise description of rowley rag
itself, before I consider the products which it yields by igneous
fusion. This species of basalt is fine-grained, of a confused
crystallized texture; its fracture uneven in small pieces, con-
choidal in large pieces. Its hardness superior to- common glass,
but inferior to feldspar. Its tenacity considerable. Its action on
the magnetic needle. strong, but without signs of polarity. - Its
specific. gravity, according to my trials, 2.868. Its general
colour iron gray, approaching to black. It is opaque; and it
