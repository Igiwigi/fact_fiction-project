It is to be added that the discriminatrix is in the pregent

case the plane y=0, or, if we attend only to the plane figure, it is the line y=0; 0 that

in the plane figure the separation into regions is effected by means of the Bicorn and

the line y=0.

277. Reverting to the equation of the Bicorn, and considering first the form at infi-
nity, the intersections of the curve by the line infinity are given by the equation
4(24—z)=0, viz. there is a threefold intersection y*=0, and a simple intersection
24—ax=0; the equation y*=0 indicates that the intersection in question is a point of
inflexion, the tangent at the inflexion (or stationary tangent) being of course the line
infinity ; the visible effect is, however, only that the direction of the branch is ultimately
parallel to the axis of ». The equation 2y—a=0 indicates an asymptote parallel to
this line, and the equation of the asymptote is easily found to be 2y—ax+5=0.

278. 'The discussion of the equation would show that the curve has an ordinary cusp;
and a cusp of the second kind, or node-cusp, equivalent to a cusp and node; the curve
is therefore a unicursal curve, or the coordinates are expressible rationally in terms of a
parameter ©; we in fact have

a==(0+2(8—#+2p—4)

(6+2)*(p—3)
P(p+1) ;

4 =I0(p+2).

279. The curve may be traced from these equations (se Plate, fig 2, where the bicorn
is delineated along with a cubic curve afterwards referred to): as $ extends from an
indefinitely small positive value « through infinity to —1—s, we have the upper branch
of the curve, viz. P=8, gives &==, y=—c, point at infinity, the tangent being horizontal.

p=o, gives z=—1, y=>+, the node-cusp, tangent parallel to axis of y.
