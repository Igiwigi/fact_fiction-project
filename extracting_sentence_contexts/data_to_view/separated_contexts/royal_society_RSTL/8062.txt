I do not see how this Gymnospermous theory
can be entertained any longer; but to make the facts upon which it was based accord
with our systems we must alter the latter. In the discussion which followed the reading of my memoir on Calamites before the
Royal Society in January 1871, Dr. CaretxTER threw out a snggestion which accords
with my own conclusions on the question. One great distinction between the Exogens
and Endogens is to be found in the fact that, when a formation of yessels is made in the
woody zone of the former type, the clusters of vessels are left uninclosed, and conse-
quently capable of receiving any amount of addition to their number without inter-
ference with the continuity of the series. On the other hand, the opposite is the case
with the Endogens. Here each cluster of yessels is incased in a dense cylinder of woody
prosenchyma, which latter always interferes to interrupt all continuous additions to the
former tissues.
