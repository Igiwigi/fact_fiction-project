In the later stages of the reaction between stretched hair and sodium sulphide
it would seem that the molecular chains, themselves, are also ruptured, with the

consequence that some of the §-phase, relieved of tension, reverts once more to the
a-phase ; but because there has been such a destruction of protein in the body of the
fibre, the original alignment of the erystallites is lost.

The Keratin Chain.—The combined evidence of chemical and X-ray analysis, when
brought to bear on the problem of fibre structure in both organic and inorganic fields, is
undoubtedly leading to a relatively simple generalisation, in fact, to a conclusion no more
profound than that fibres are what they are because their inner molecular structure is
also of a fibrous nature. In only a few years the literature of the subject has grown too
great to permit detailed reference here, and the reader should consult the writings of
Marx, Meyer, Herzoc, Sponster, Hess, Hawortu, Staupinerr, and many others,
if a thorough account is required of the work that has been carried out on the structure
of cellulose, fibroin, chitin, ete. The properties of hair and the type of the X-ray photo-
graphs which have been described above do not offer us any sufficient reason to doubt
that the animal fibres so far examined must possess certain fundamental features
analogous to those of the vegetable fibres discussed elsewhere. Whatever may be the
constitution of the keratins as a class, we are justified by the experimental results now
before us in assuming as a sound working hypothesis that keratin fibres, like cellulose
fibres, owe many of their properties to the repetition along the fibre of comparatively
