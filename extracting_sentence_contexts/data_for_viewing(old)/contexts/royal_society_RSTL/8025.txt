First, as to the modification of strain that may result from the heaving or vertical
motion of a ship floating among waves. It is obvious that such motion must produce

Sphanges of strain ; for when a vessel in moving downwards receives a check, the effect is

So increase the straining-forces acting upon her; and when, in moving upwards, she
eaches her highest position, and is for the moment partially abandoned by the water

=upport, the strains upon the hull will be diminished. If the abandonment were total
that is, in the hypothetical case when the ship is left up in the air), all bending- and

Zhearing-strains would, in fact, disappear ; for then every particle in the ship would, for

Yhe moment, have impressed upon it the accelerating force of gravity, acting equally
And in parallel directions throughout her.

= Mr. W. Frovpe and Professor RANKINE have both referred to this 8ubject when dealing

Svith the strains of ships at sea ; and the latter gentleman has attempted to fix the limit-

4g maximum increase of strain produced by vertical motion. This he considers to be
