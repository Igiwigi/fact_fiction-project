and our task is to establish the mathematical abstraction which they represent. The successful
elucidation of a theory of universal biology from the examples of biology around us would
answer the question of why it is that the phenomenon of life could exist, i.e. is a logically allowed
possibility. Furthermore, universal biology would immediately shed light on the question of the
ubiquity and inevitability of life, if it turned out that life is an inevitable consequence of the
laws of physics, to be expected in any sufficiently complicated environment that is sufficiently far
from equilibrium to enable multiple layers of hierarchical organization to exist, with numerous
feedbacks between them. Our prejudice is that this is the case: life is one of the processes that
allows planets to come to equilibrium.

If life is, in fact, a means to dissipate free energy, one would expect that the mechanisms
behind all its universal properties involve free energy-driven non-equilibrium processes. One
of these universal features of life is homochiralityâ€”the fact that all the chiral amino acids used
by terrestrial biology are left handed (the sugars are right handed). The fact that this effect is
not a mere enantiomeric excess is surprising and requires a detailed explanation. Our recent
work [5] shows that homochirality emerges as a consequence of a rather general characteristic
of life: autocatalysis/self-replication driven by an external source of energy. The consequence of
the chiral symmetry breaking of biopolymers is that it is possible for them to make higher order
structures, such as the supercoiling and packing of DNA, something that would be very difficult
for racemic molecules.

This is not enough to define life in our opinion because one needs the dynamics associated
with evolvability. A purely chemical process differs from a living system in that it does not store
