In figure 7, we plot Â£ as a function of the parameter w for a =0.2,1 and 5.5 and for only those
speeds v where the bridge crack propagation is admissible according to (2.4). We note that 6 is a
continuous function of @ but not injective in some regions of the curves shown.

As f approaches unity in figure 7, we see that w also increases. Consequently, we can conclude
that increasing the speed of the bridge crack brings increasing stresses to the entire region located
behind the crack front.

In addition, the magnitude of w is much smaller than that of 6. This is expected on physical
grounds, as the horizontal links respond to the linear vertical deformation of the transverse links,
which have a small contrast in length dictated by A. A small vertical deformation therefore
does not produce a large extension in the horizontal links. Also, as the anisotropy parameter
a increases, figure 7 shows that the magnitude of @ increases. This result is due to the fact that
increasing a corresponds to a softening of the lateral links in the medium, enabling the horizontal
links to undergo greater axial deformations.

It can also be clearly seen from figure 7 that for all admissible speeds of bridge crack failure the
parameter a is less than 1. As a consequence, if the horizontal links inside the chain are assumed
to have the same strength as the vertical links, all admissible bridge crack regimes are realizable
in the structures considered.

Here, our conclusions are based on the fact that all links in the structure possess the same
strength. The results leading to these evaluations use the solution from [36], which gives
the profile of the chain during steady bridge failure regimes. These profiles are obtained
independently of any information on the behaviour of vertical odd-numbered links and
