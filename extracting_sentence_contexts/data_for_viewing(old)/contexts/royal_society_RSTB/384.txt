external surface, as far as it could be seen from such a point of view, was always of
the same colour as the lower compartment, but I do not think that the larvee ever
stretched so far ; in fact, the tubes were of such a length that it would have been very
difficult for them to doso, All the dimensions were adopted after careful measurement
of larvee in Stage III. The upper compartment was illuminated through the upper
aperture, and the lower by the open end of the tube, and also partially through the

space between the larva and the perforation in the lower disc, but this was largely
blocked by the larval bristles. The different sizes of the openings through which the
compartments were illuminated corresponded to the fact that the light which came
down from the window into the upper compartment was far stronger than that which
was veflected up into the lower chamber (the glass sheet with the tubes adhering
being placed a short distance above an ordinary plain deal table), In order to apply
the tubes, the larvae were induced to suspend themselves from sheets of glass. A
number of strips of glass were cut of various lengths, and equal, but narrow, widths
(about 4 centimetres), and these were placed together so as to form a number of
separate rectangular frames, the angles being secured with gummed paper, a sheet of
glass being placed as a roof over the top of each. In this way a number of glass boxes
were obtained, having very low sides (4 centimetres), and very large covers. As soon
as the larvee in the stock quitted the food-plant they were turned into these boxes,
and, the low sides offering little impediment, they soon mounted to the roof, and
prepared for suspension. Some of the boxes were compartmented by another glass
