We have traced in temporary cartilage those changes which occur preparatory to
its conversion into bone: it now remains for the authors to describe the results of
their researches on the mode in which that conversion is effected, and concerning
which there hitherto has been a great diversity of opinion.

Preceding ossific , deposit, the intercolumnar tissue, which may not only be seen
between the columns of cells, but also passing more or less perfectly between the
individual cells, becomes in some cases slightly fibrous in appearance, and of a light
brown colour; this condition speedily gives way to a highly granular state ; in fact it
has become bone, and encloses, in osseous cavities or crypts, the cartilage cells. For
reasons which will hereafter be sufficiently obvious, we $hall in future call these
lacunal cells. If thin sections be made with a very sharp knife through ossifying
cartilage, and placed in water or albumen under the quarter or eighth object-glass,
we $ball occasionally find lacunal cells which have escaped from their osseous crypts,
floating loose in the fluid, and offering a favourable opportunity for the examination
of their characters. It may then be seen that the thick pellucid outer investment
has become granular, and that the enclosed granular cell has lost its regular outline,
and become angular or ragged, while the nucleus has become obscured by the changes
in the more external parts of the cell, an early stage of which is seen in Plate VIII.
fig. 19 and 22 a. Such are the appearances presented in some of the detached
lacunal cells, but they may be seen in both earlier and later stages of development
