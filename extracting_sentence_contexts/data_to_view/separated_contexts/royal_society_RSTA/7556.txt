Neglecting the curvature of the earth and any sedimentary deposits near the surface,
a two-layer system provides a convenient model for such a comparison and accordingly

we take
PalP: = & | (5-2)

with Poisson’s condition, AL /% (5-3)

Jeffreys (1935) uses (5-2), and experiments have shown Poisson’s condition to be reasonably
true for rocks not too far below the surface (see Birch & Law 1935). It will be seen later
how little our main results depend on exact values of constants. With the above ratios we have

Returning now to the integrals (3-40), (3-41), (4-4) to (4-6) it is seen on closer inspection
that ¢,, y, are even in A,,,* so that regarding ¢ as a complex variable the arc A(A,,) = 0is not
in fact a branch line of the integrand; this is not so of the arcs A(A,,), B(Ay.)s R(Ag,) = 0,
and in any distortion of the ¢-path of integration these arcs and any poles of the integrands
are to be avoided. The pair ¢,, y, are even in A,, only, and it is the cuts R(g,), Baa) s
R(Ap,) = 0 together with any poles which must be avoided. Further, we see that each of the
integrals in the ¢-plane, for a given complex a, is of one of the two forms

m= [- O(©) cos tx de, (5°6)

xo = | CG(C) sin Grae, (5-7)

where G(¢) is even in ¢ and contains a factor vanishing exponentially on any arc of the
circle at infinity, except possibly in the neighbourhood of the negative imaginary axis
where G(¢) is O(1/|¢|).
