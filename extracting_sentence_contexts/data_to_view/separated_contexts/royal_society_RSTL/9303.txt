@ constant factors, and observing that « is replaced by a”, we have
S D(u, 1)+D( q)=[6=1,== ]=[p+v,=0]
i= =exp (45), =exp (41? log q). Z 65. We have equations of this form for the four functions, but with a proper
S constant multiplier in each equation : the equations, in fact, are

E A(u, r)={A(0, 1)+A(0, 9)} exp (4u* log gals, 4)

It is to be observed that r is the 8ame function of 7 that q is of k: this would at

once follow from Jacopr's equation log q= EE,

where if the identity of the two values of k or of the two values of & were proved
independently (as might doubtless be done), the required theorem (7 the same function
of K that q is of k) would follow conversely: and thence the other equations of the
system.
