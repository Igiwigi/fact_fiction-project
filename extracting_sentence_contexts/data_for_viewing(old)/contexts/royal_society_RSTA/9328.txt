THE STRUCTURE OF HAIR, WOOL, AND RELATED FIBRES. 83

in photographs of stretched hairs the small-angle scattering appears to be much increased
(compare Plate 2, fig. 5c).

Whereas the most prominent layer-line in the «-photograph corresponds to a trans-
lation of 5-15 A.U., the strongest layer-line in the 8-photograph gives a translation of
6-64 A.U., an increase of about 29 per cent. This hyperbola is the one which shows
clearly in Plate 2, fig. 5c. The equatoris marked by three spots, the (001) mentioned above,
a very strong new spot of spacing 4-65 A.U. which we have called (200), and a very
weak (400). On the first hyperbola there is a fairly strong (210), a weaker (111), and
avery weak (410). There is no sign of (010), but there is a clear, sharp are in the position
of (020) on the second hyperbola. The fact that this are never closes up into a sharp
spot suggests that it is perhaps in reality composite, for instance, (020) flanked by (120)
or (021). On the same hyperbola there is also a faint spot near the position of (220).
On the third hyperbola there are weak ares corresponding to (230), and underneath
them a still weaker reflection (030).

All these reflections may be referred to an orthogonal cell of dimensions, a = 9-3 A.U.,
b = 6-64 A.U., ande=9-8A.U. Table TI shows the observed and calculated spacings
from a review of the whole of the available data.
