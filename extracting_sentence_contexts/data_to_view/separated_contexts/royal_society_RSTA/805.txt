It is assumed that classical nucleation theory can be applied and that neither adjacent clusters
nor steps interact. There is a critical undercooling at which the critical 2D nucleus radius size
is of the same order of magnitude as the terrace length. In fact, evaluating Lstep = Vstep/Vi1i
with equation (4.3) and the critical nucleus radius as R35, = ((Vstep/h)/(AH¢ AT))Tm shows that
R3p/Lstep © 0.15-0.25 at AT ~ 25-40 K. Upon increasing the undercooling, several nuclei may
initiate on the same terrace and their steps interact more and more during lateral growth. If
not rough at equilibrium, the steps themselves become increasingly jagged with higher kink
concentration and larger growth site density.
