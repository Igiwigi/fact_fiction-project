I last year took the liberty to request you to lay before the
Royal Society, I offered a conjecture, that the vessels of the bark,
which pass from the leaves to the extremities of the roots, were,
in their organization, better calculated to carry the fluids they
contain towards the roots than in the opposite direction. I had
not, however, at that time, any experiment directly to support
this supposition ; but I thought the forms generally assumed by
trees in their growth, evinced the compound and contending
actions of gravitation, and of an intrinsic power in the vessels
of the bark, to give motion to the fluid passing through them.
In the account of the experiments which I have now the honour
to address to you, I trust I shall be able to adduce some interest-
ing facts, in support of that inference.

Having elected, in the spring of 1802, four strong shoots of
the vine, growing along the horizontal trellis of my vinery, I
depressed a part of each shoot, whilst it was soft and succulent,
about three inches deep, into the mould of a pot placed beneath
it for that purpose ; but without making any wound, or incision,
in the young shoots thus employed as layers.
