fig. 1) of the Life-Table, in the most direct way; and these equations may be deduced
from the determined rate of mortality at certain intervals of age.

The relative numbers living at two ages, 20 and 21, can evidently be found from an
equation which expresses the relation of the average numbers living and dying between
those ages during a given time. This can be determined very nearly ; for although the
ages of the living are not ascertained with exact precision at the census, Still by taking
all the numbers living at the ages 15, 16, 17 years up to 24 and under 25, iron;
the aggregate represents very nearly the numbers living in that decenniad of life, The
deaths at the same ages are obtained with at least equal accuracy from the registers of

deaths. By this process, and by extending the observations over tive or more years, a
number of facts is obtained sufficiently great to yield average results; and it may be


assumed that the ratio of the living at the ages 15—25* to the dying in a year at the
same ages 15—25 represents the annual rate of mortality at the exact age 20. So also
the mortality rate at the ages 30, 40, 50 and other ages may be determined. As obserya-
tions grow more exact, and the facts are multiplied, the intervals of age may be dimi-
nished to 5 years, and ultimately to 1 year.

In determining the rate of mortality, a given number of persons living a year is
considered equivalent to twice that number living half a year, or to half the number
