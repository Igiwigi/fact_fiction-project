The movement of the appendage which resulted from stimulation of the posterior
nerve I regarded as being due to reflex action, and to settle this point the following
experiment was made :—

(3.) The posterior ventral nerve was cut and its peripheral end stimulated. No
movement of the appendage resulted, but, on applying the electrodes to the central
end, results occurred similar to those described under (2).

(4.). With respect to the posterior ventral nerves, MarsHat* states that on
stimulating the peripheral end of one of them (in the Lobster) no effect was produced.
Hence he concluded that “the anterior nerve would seem to be mixed, but the
posterior nerve purely sensory.” This result was due to the fact that, in his experi-
ments, the animal was fixed in such a position that it was impossible to observe any
contraction of the extensor muscles. If, however, the animal be placed in such a
position that the extensor muscles can be observed while the posterior nerve is being
stimulated near the ganglion, and therefore on the ventral aspect of the body, a
marked tetanus of the extensor muscles is found to follow stimulation.

(5.) The posterior dorsal nerves in the case of Astacus are so delicate and deep
lying, and their unbranched free portion is so extremely short, that it is impossible to
directly stimulate them without escape of the current into the muscles. The experi-
ment was therefore carried out in the following manner :—The anterior and posterior
ventral nerves were cut on both sides and in each segment of the abdomen. Thus
only the posterior dorsal nerves were left intact. The nerve cord was then cut in the
