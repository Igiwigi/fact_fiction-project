This initiative echoes several recent, ambitious
restoration programmes that aim to plant trillions of trees and
restore millions of hectares [1]. Many of these initiatives, includ-
ing the 350-million hectare Bonn Challenge, adopt ‘forest and
landscape restoration’ (FLR), an approach based on the expan-
sion of tree cover through multiple tree-planting and
reforestation schemes, including commercial plantations of
exotic species [4]. In fact, 45% of the restoration area committed
to the Bonn Challenge consists of large-scale commercial mono-
cultures of questionable environmental benefits [5]. Exotic species may play important roles in FLR due to
their rapid recovery of fuelwood and timber, financial
benefits to farmers and potential to foster or, at least, not
harm forest regeneration [6,7]. Yet some exotics can become
invasive alien trees [7-9].
