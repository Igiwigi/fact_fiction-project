micrometre-sized spherulites consisting of individual nanoparticles that are 50-60nm in size :
(15 min). In a subsequent stage, these vaterite spherulites transform to calcite, via a slower (hours) [4
dissolution and re-precipitation mechanism [85]. An alternative pathway that leads to the direct DN
conversion of ACC to calcite with no vaterite intermediate can occur through doping of the initial 1B
ACC with Mg [86] (figure 5f). Recent studies [87,88] have extended this work (using XAS on :@
beamline 118 and high-resolution XRD on beamline I11) to show that the presence of organic .
molecules is key to controlling the ACC crystallization pathway and to describing the high
temperature/pressure transformation of ACC to vaterite in systems equivalent to extraterrestrial
environments [89,90].

Iron minerals and their formation and inter-transformations in terrestrial, atmospheric or
marine settings control many other element cycles. This is due to their often nanoparticulate
nature and thus high surface area and reactivity but also due to the fact that they are most
often involved in multiple redox reactions both in solution and solid phases. For example, iron
sulfides (mackinawite, greigite and pyrite) play a fundamental role in sedimentary environments,
ore deposits and heavy metal immobilization. However, their solution-based formation and
transformation has only in the last decade been addressed using synchrotron-based in situ
and time-resolved diffraction [91,92]. These studies have shown that following solution-based
reactions in highly anoxic systems is feasible and that the crystallization of pre-formed,
poorly ordered mackinawite (an Fe+ only containing phase, nominal FeS) can, depending on
redox conditions and additives, follow various pathways. Under highly reducing conditions,
mackinawite often transforms first to a highly magnetic and Fe** /Fe>+ bearing intermediate,
greigite (Fe3S4) [92]. This ultimately recrystallizes and leads to the formation of the geologically
stable pyrite (FeS2).
