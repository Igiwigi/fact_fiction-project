The chylaqueons fluid must however be regarded as in itself a manufactory ;
1Ts corpuscles execute an office by which the mineral substances and proximate prin-
ciples are vitally assimilated. In the Annelida (and therefore in the Entozoa and
Echinoderms) the corpuscles do in Tas FLUID, as already explained, what in the
higher Invertebrata and Vertebrata is accomplished by corpuscles, somewhat more
definitively organized, floating in the true-blood. From these facts the physiologist
may state, that under all circumstances, how simple soever the fluid may be, the agency
of cells, either in the solids through which the fluids pass, or floating in the fluids
themselves, is more or less essential to the vitalization of the liquid medium of nutri-
tion. In the Annelida the true-blood is incorpusculated, because the cell ageney is
performed in the fluid, lower in grade than itself, which oscillates in the peritoneal
cavity. If this fluid did not exist, then the corpuscles, solid cells, would probably
have been present in the true-blood, there to enact their destined functions.
