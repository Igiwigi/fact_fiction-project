H. FLOWER ON THE DEVELOPMENT AND

them®, they are both (if all recent researches into their early development can be trusted)
formed side by side from independent portions of the primitive dental groove, and may
rather be compared to twin brothers, one of which, destined for early functional activity,
proceeds rapidly in its development, while the other makes little progress until the time
approaches when it is called upon to take the place of its more precocious locum tenens. Many facts appear to point to the milk-teeth as being the less constant and important
of the two sets developed in diphyodont dentition. Among these the most striking is
the frequent occurrence of this set in a rudimentary and functionless, or, as it were,
partially developed state. The milk-premolars of some Rodents (as the Guinea-pig), hed
while the animal is in wtero, the simple structure and evanescent nature of the milk-
teeth of the Bats, Insectivores, and Seals, the diminutive first incisors of the Dugongs
and Elephants, all appear to be cases in point.
