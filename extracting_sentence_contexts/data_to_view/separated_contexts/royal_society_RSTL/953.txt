has a bit of sponge inserted in a small aperture at the bottom
of it. When a light is wanted, it is only necessary to shake
the bottle s0 as to moisten the sponge with the alcohol, take
out the stopper, and put the smallest particle of the powder on
the moistened sponge ; it instantly becomes red hot, and will
readily kindle one of the matches. This mode of igniting a
metal] seems to be quite a new fact in the history of chemistry ;
but the means of keeping it in a state of ignition, is only
another illustration of the facts previously pointed out by
Sir H. Davy, in his late valuable researches, which have
thrown so much light on the philosophy of flame, and led to
such very interesting, important, and unexpected results. 5. On.
