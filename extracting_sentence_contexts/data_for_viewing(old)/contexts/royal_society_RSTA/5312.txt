10m. Furthermore, the time scales of the semiconductor laser dynamics and CS formation are on
the nanosecond scale, which allows for fast and accurate gathering of data. Finally, VCSEL physics
and dynamics are quite well understood [90-92]. Therefore, many theoretical and experimental
studies on CS formation in VCSELs have been carried out [93-106]. CSs have successfully been
demonstrated in broad-area VCSELs both below [93,95] and above [96] the lasing threshold
when injecting a holding beam of appropriate frequency. Spatially, LSs have also been found in
medium-size VCSELs but only by using their particular polarization properties [97]. CS lasers in
a VCSEL system without a holding beam have been demonstrated both experimentally [98] and
theoretically [99] in VCSELs subject to frequency selective optical feedback and in face-to-face
coupled VCSELs [100,101]. In these systems, the VCSELs are placed in self-imaging optical
systems with either an external grating or another VCSEL biased below lasing threshold, so that
the system becomes bistable. Lasing spots spontaneously appear in these systems and can be
switched on and off by another laser beam. As a matter of fact, broad area laser with saturable
absorber was the first system in which CSs were predicted and studied theoretically [102-104].
CSs in a monolithic optically pumped VCSEL with a saturable absorber have been demonstrated
in [105] and their switching dynamics studied in [106]. Several applications of CSs in VCSELs have
been demonstrated: optical memory [107], optical delay line [108] and optical microscopy [109].

excitonsâ€”polaritons

High-speed switching, i.e. processing speed in optical systems combined with the possibility of
parallel processing in broad area systems gives a clear advantage to optical systems with respect
to electronic circuits. However, the optical systems have also a serious disadvantage with respect
