It was laid down on
an undulating surface of clay which had by no means grown up to lake level over the old
valley near Leicester, nor south of Coventry, but which south of Charnwood Forest was
nearly up to the waterâ€™s surface. By this stage the ice must have advanced at least as far
south as Croft, because of the boulders from there in the Lower Wolston clays, yet the
later Wolston sand (and gravels of the same age around Hinckley), obviously water
deposited, extend back to the Leicester area. This means a glacial retreat, and the very
fact that clay gives place to sand and gravel is further evidence of much increased summer
melting. This first advance presumably halted some way north of the southern limit of the
Wolston sand (figure 8). Yet an auger traverse on Radford Semele hill (M.R. 351643 and
just south of the edge of figure 9) showed two layers of typical Chalky Boulder Clay
interbedded with stoneless plastic clays (see figure 10).
