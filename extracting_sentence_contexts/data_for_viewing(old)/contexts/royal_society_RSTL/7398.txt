The only Nematoids I have seen in actu coitus were specimens of Cephalobus pers:
the male was coiled around, at right angles to the female, in the same fashion as w.
observed by Ducks with specimens of Anguillula acets, and as others have noticed W:

There s8eems to be no fixed period of the year which may more especially be io
as the breeding-season of these animals; in spring, summer, autumn, and mid-win
alike I have found amongst the free species females containing impregnated ova. In
the majority of these animals, too, the ova are very large in proportion to the size of
the body, and few in numberâ€”in both respects presenting a striking contrast to what
usually met with amongst the parasitic forms. The two divisions of this order agrey
however, in the fact that, whilst the majority of the species are oviparous, the remaind}
are viviparous, bringing forth active young, presenting in a miniature form the extern
characters of the adult animals,

DEVELOPMENT.

Under this head IT have nothing new to say concerning the early development of the
ovarian cells and spermatozoa, or the actual process of fecundation in the Nematoidk
This has been treated of most fully with reference to the parasitic species by NELS0N%
Biscnopy, LevorART, Mnrssxes, and ALLEN THOMPSON, and as it occurs amongst the free
Nematoids by Davains and CartER; and for the results of their investigations I musb
refer to the various periodicals in which these observations were recorded. To have
gone over this ground, and to have endeavoured to reconcile discrepancies at presenb
