a base of 40 mm.

Lacrymal Secretion and Tears.—In the Saurians and Crocodiles the lacrymal gland is
quite small in comparison with the size of the globe. As RarHxe first pointed out,*
the Crocodilia possess three sets of lacrymal glands, the most important being the
Harderian glands, but as he also discovered, the secretion passes straight into the
lacrymal duct behind the conjunctiva, so that it entirely avoids the eyeball. Now
[ find that the other two sets, viz., the conjunctival glands and also the lacrymal
glands, play a very insignificant réle as far as the lubrication of the eye is concerned.
My experiments entirely confirm the statements of RarHKe that the function of all
these glands seems to be to lubricate the food, rather than to wash away foreign matter
from the eyes. In fact the water which is their chief element performs this quite
effectively. I made the experiment of squeezing the juice of an onion mixed with
common salt into the eyes of four species in order to ascertain whether this irritating
solution would excite any flow of tears, but it had no effect in increasing the moisture
beyond the slight normal secretion. To my mind this is conclusive that the popular
