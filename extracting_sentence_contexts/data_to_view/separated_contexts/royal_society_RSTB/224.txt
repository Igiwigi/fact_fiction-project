Proportionately we thus see that the elbow is very generally though feebly primarily
represented (cf: the Wrist).
(ii) Character of Movement. (a.) Absolute.—Of the 50 movements,

26 were extension,
23 ,, flexion,
1 was confusion,

These opposed movements were grouped thus: extension alone was obtained at 6
(12 times), 6’ (5 times), and 81 ; whereas flexion alone was obtained at

82
83, ae 87,

At centres 11, 79, and 80, viz., the neutral ground between the two extremes just
detailed, both flexion and extension were nearly equally represented, with, however
slight predominance of the former.

(b.) Primary.—Of the 50 total or absolute movements of the elbow, only 9 were
primary, this notably illustrating its subordinate importance. Of these, 6 were
extension and 3 were flexion. The distribution of these primary movements was the
same as that of the absolute movements,

REPRESENTATION OF THE MovVEMENTS OF THE SuounpER, (See Plate 42, fig. 20.)

(i.) Total or Absolute Representation.—Altogether 62 movements of the joint were
observed, occurring at the following centres, in order of diminishing frequency :—

The important fact here exhibited, namely, that the shoulder is not represented at
centres 85 and 87, will not escape notice (vide March, infra), On the other hand,
of 14 total primary movements at centre 79, the shoulder claims no less than 13; and
for centre 11, out of a total of 14, it claims 12. Thus, the localisation of the
shoulder, like that of the thumb, is very perfectly defined.

(ii.) Primary Representation —The shoulder, like the thumb, being an important
joint in the initiation of movements, moved primarily 34 times at the following
centres, in the order of diminishing intensity :—
