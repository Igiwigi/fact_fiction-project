The curve, the ordinate of which re-
presents the time of high water (reckoned from the moon's transit), is not symme-
trical with regard to its maximum ordinates. The curye, the ordinate of which
represents the height of high water, is not symmetrical with regard to its mean line
of abscissas. Yet in both these cases the theoretical and obseryed curve agree within
a minute and an inch during their whole course, It is impossible to doubt, under
these cireumstances, that the theoretical formula truly represents the obseryed facts. 4. But this agreement belongs to the mean of all the obseryations ; and we have
further to seek for the alteration in the formula, which is requisite in order to repre-
sent the effect of changes in the parallax and declination of the sun and moon.
