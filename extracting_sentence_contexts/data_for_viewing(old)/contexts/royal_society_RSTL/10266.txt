was als perfectly definite and sharp. The fringes visible in the bright portion of the
field (corresponding to the black seen by reflected light) were for the greatest part of
their length vertical, bub at first they often displayed a very considerable curvature at
their lower extremities. In such cases they crossed the boundary at a very small
angle and were lost in the dark band. The direction of the curvature was different
on different occasions. The accompanying figure is a reproduction of a sketch on an

enlarged scale made at a time when the phenomenon was very marked. The cause of
the curvature was evidently an increasing difference of thickness between the films
in the two tubes in the neighbourhood of the limits of their black portions.
As all did not thin at precisely the same rate, this limit was in different films at
different vertical elevations, and it might at first 8ight seem probable that the curva-
ture was due to the fact that the boundaries between the white and black were in
the one tube lower than in the other. The interfering rays in a given horizontal
Plane would thus, in the one case, traverse black films only, while in the other they
would also pass through ome white ones, and, as the number of these would increase
rapidly as the vertical elevation of the plane diminished, a distortion of the fringes
similar to that observed might have been produced.
: If this had been the true explanation, we should have expected either that the
intensity of the illumination would have increased gradually on passing from the
dark to the bright transmitted bands, or that a marked discontinuity would have
been observed in the curved fringes at the points where the number of the white
films traversed increazed. Neither of these phenomena were observed. The dark
part of the field was very intense close to the boundary and the curves were
unbroken. :
