E., the
deflections produced are in the contrary direction to those of the Birmingham wire. I do not consider that this fact in itself proves that the currents are generated in
the earth, for they might arise from other causes, and yet exhibit the same result. I only mention the fact in this place to facilitate the consideration of the direction
in which the currents alternate, and to indicate that when the direction of the cur-
rent between any two places is described, it is not meant that the wire is laid in a
direct line between the two points, but that the earth connections are $0 placed. Referring the direction of deflection in every case to those produced by the
Birmingham wire, and denoting those which accord with it by the sign +, and those
which exhibit a contrary deflection —, the results of the experiments on direction
were as follows :;—

Derby to Willington, bearing . . . . SW. +
Derby to Birmingham, bearing. . . . $8.28?
