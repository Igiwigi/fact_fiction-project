Again. Is there not something as extraordinary in the
pigeon, which can, in a few hours, find out its home, though
taken away in a box and totally excluded from the light, to
the distance of two hundred miles, as in that bird which quits
one shore to seek another, whatever may be the extent of
intervening seas? The fact seems to be, that we, the /ittle
lords of the creation, are too- prone to. measure the sentient
principle in animals by the scale of our own ideas, and thus,
unwillingly, allow them to possess faculties which may. sur-
pass our own, though peculiarly appropriate to their respec-
tive natures ; but a little reflection must compel us to confess,
that they are endowed with discriminating powers totally
unknown to, and for ever unattainable by man. I have no
objection to admit the possibility that birds may be overtaken
by the cold of winter, and thus be thrown into the: situation
of other animals-which remain torpid at that season ; though
I must own I never witnessed the fact, nor could I ever 9b-
tain evidence on the subject that was to-me satisfactory : but
as it has been often asserted, may I be allowed to suppose,
that some deception might have been practised with the de-
sign of misleading those to whom it might seem to have
appeared obvious ? For far be it from me to insinuate that
the subject has been wilfully misrepresented by those natu-
ralists, who have stated it as a fact.
