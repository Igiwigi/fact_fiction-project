tot hitherto been noticed in inheritance tables. The existence of this changing
variability would not affect in any way the general theory of linear regression applied
to heredity in populations. It would, however, lead to an immediate extension of
that theory consisting in the tabling of the standard deviations of the arrays.
Should the standard deviations of these arrays show no bias towards a linear
distribution, but only the fluctuation to be expected from random sampling about
the mean value o ,/(1 — 7°), we should have a strong argument against the present
general theory of alternative inheritance. We seem here, therefore, to have a crucial
test of the validity of the theory, which may be quite as easy to apply as the previous
test of the numerical value of the parental correlation.

Of course the results now reached are not consistent theoretically with normal
correlation surfaces with their elliptic contour lines. The fact that Mr. Ganron came
to his elliptic contours in the first instance on the basis of his observations, and not
from any theory,* shows that they must in the case he was dealing with be approxi-
mately correct. Further, there is no doubt that in other statistics for characters in
man there is within the limits of random sampling a close approximation to normal
distribution. It might be hard to consider that such a deviation as would arise with
a continuously increasing variability of the arrays from one side to the other of the
table could exist and escape notice, had we not in physics had evidence that theory
has often led to the discovery of an obvious relation which time after time must have
been overlooked by previous observers unprovided with the theoretical hint of what
to seek for. Hence while we may say that the parental correlation given by the
theory is too rigid for the facts, we must leave this second test until more careful
examination ad hoc has been made of the ample existing data,
