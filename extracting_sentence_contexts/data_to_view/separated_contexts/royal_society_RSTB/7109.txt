As the three
species of Indian rat-fleas were described for the first time in the beginning of the present
century, our knowledge is comparatively recent; but owing to the discovery of their
connexion with plague, a number of papers on their biology have been published. The
earlier ones are by the Advisory Committee (1908, 1912) and Bacot (1914). Complications
in interpreting their data arise from the fact that these workers presumed that all fleas
found on the Indian rats were Xenopsylla cheopis; but they were really dealing with a
mixture of X. cheopis and X. astia, and perhaps of X. brasiliensis also. In consequence, their
observations on the bionomics cannot be considered applicable to X. cheopis alone. More-
over, both temperature and humidity fluctuated considerably during their experiments,
and their methods of measurement and control of these factors were ‘not so precise as those
which are used nowadays’ (Buxton 1938, p. 525).
