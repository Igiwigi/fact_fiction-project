a primitive form of electric furnace was constructed which could raise the temperature
of the enclosed space to 270° C. in about an hour, and could attain 300° C, with

difficulty in two hours. The tubes, which were about 37 centims. long, were placed
in the axis of the furnace, which projected about 10 centims. beyond each end.

The next difficulty which threatened to be serious was that due to the shimmering
produced by currents of unequally heated air. The distance between the two mirrors
of the refractometer cannot be indefinitely increased ; and the gradient of temperature
between the furnace and the air outside must necessarily be steep. In fact, the
whole fall of temperature occurred in a distance of about six inches. It appeared
probable that the mirage effects would make it impossible to read the bands. _ This
danger was, however, completely met by a device previously used by M. Le Roux.
In each end of the furnace three diaphragms of ordinary plate glass were inserted,
separated by distances of about an inch, and the internal cylinder of the furnace was
prolonged by a paper tube four inches long, which deflected the air currents. By this
means all flicker was avoided, and, during an experiment, the bands appeared to pass
perfectly steadily, even when the temperature was at its highest point. So far as
this cause of error was concerned, there was no difficulty in reading the bands
to 35 of their breadth.

Having determined the form of the apparatus, the next point for consideration was
