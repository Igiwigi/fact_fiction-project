As to its recognition there can be no difficulty, but what is not so easy, on first
studying the subject, is to determine which is the abactinal and which is the actinal
aspect of the organism. The distribution of the integumentary remains of the disc is
a criterion which at once suggests itself, but one tedious in application and more
useful for confirmation than discovery. A much readier guidance is furnished by the
arrangement of the plates of the buccal armature. Slight inspection suffices to
arrange a collection of Lapworthura in two series, one in which the jaws originate
within the arms, continuing the direction of the vertebral ossicles, and the other in which
the oral framework prolongs the direction of the lateral plates; an examination of any
modern Ophiurid will suffice to show that a similar difference in the relations of the
oral armature is presented, according as the dissected dise is viewed from the abactinal
or actinal aspect: and the actinal surface is that on which the lateral buccal shields
are exposed as a prolongation of the series of lateral arm-plates. This fact teaches
that the second of the series into which we have supposed our collection of
Lapworthura to be divided consists of specimens presenting the actinal aspect to view ;
now it is on these and these only that the madreporite is found to occur. The
madreporite is consequently actinal in position, a conclusion which the examination of
the integumentary remains fully confirms.

It may further be added that the position of the madreporite is as nearly as
possible that which it still occupies in most existing Brittlestars ; in almost all cases
it lies side by side with the second or third adambulacral plate, sometimes in contact
with the base of the first adambulacral, which enters into the oral framework.
There are no oral plates in Lapworthura, but in the modern Brittlestars these scales
cover precisely that part of the inter-radial area which corresponds to the angle in
