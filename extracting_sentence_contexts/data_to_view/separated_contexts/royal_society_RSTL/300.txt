In this
case each portion of potash, from which dry nitric acid is
separated, will displace the water from two equivalent quan-
tities of sulphuric acid, and each portion of nitric acid weigh-
ing 67,54 will be found combined with 22,64,of water. Hence
90,18 of liquid nitric acid 80 obtained -should dissolve -the
equiyalent 6g of carbonate of lime. And in fact, by an expe-
riment carefully conducted on a large scale by Mr, PuLLies,*
it appears that 6814 of such acid did dissolve 476 of marble,
which is in the proportion of 9go,18 to 62,96, corresponding
with the estimate within 4575 part, a degree of coincidence
rarely to be found even in the repetition of the same experi-
ment by the most skilful analyst. The specific gravity of this acid was found to be 1,50. * Experimental Examination of the Pharm.
