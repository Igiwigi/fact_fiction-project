The differences between the calculated and observed figures in this table are
probably rather outside experimental errors. Especially is this the case as regards
the 5-inch and 6-inch pieces. The impact seems to last appreciably longer than it
ought.

The Effect of the Rigidity of the Bullet.

In the simple theory it is assumed that the bullet is absolutely fluid. In fact, it
possesses a certain rigidity, partly because of the nickel casing and partly because of
the viscosity of the lead the effects of which may be quite appreciable at such high
speeds of deformation. The general effect of rigidity may be represented by saying
that any section of the bullet requires to be subjected to an end-pressure P before it
begins to deform at all, and this pressure must act across the section CC (fig. 4) where
deformation is just beginning and where, if the bullet were really fluid, there would be
no pressure. â€˜To a first approximation, P will be proportional to the area of the cross-
section of the bullet which is undergoing deformation, that is to \ the mass per unit
length in the plane CC. The pressure P is added to that due to the destruction ot
momentum, making a total pressure P+)v* where A is the mass per foot of the section
of the bullet in the plane CC, v the velocity of that section. Further, the part of the
bullet behind CC is being continually retarded by the pressure P, with the result that
