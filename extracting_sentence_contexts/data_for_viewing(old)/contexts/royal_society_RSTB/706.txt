in the figure, which is enlarged 10 diameters. The parts contained within the
prosenchymatous boundary, which latter has followed the slopes of the contracting
conical tubercle, also incline inwards as they ascend towards the apex of that organ.

I must call attention to yet one more section of one of these tubercular vascular
bundles (C. N. 645 B). Fig. 404 represents a longitudinal section through the bundle
of another Ulodendroid tubercle, for which I am again indebted to my invaluable
coadjutor, Mr. Wixp. It is enlarged 18 diameters. Its tracheal bundle, b, consists
of the ordinary type of barred vessels, but in its centre, a, we find three or four distinct
columns of parenchymatous cells, of the same type as those common in the interior
of Ferns, DE Bary’s medullary cells. The periphery d consists of cortical cells.
This development of medullary cells in the interior of a large Halonial or Ulodendroid
bundle is a notable fact, which we shall shortly find to have some special significance.
That the bundle is a true tubercular one is beyond question.

There still remain for consideration some additional observations respecting true
Lepidodendroid strobili. Bronentart pointed out the necessity for the temporary
retention of the name Lepidostrobus, only because, in his time, no clue whatever
had been obtained for the identification of any one of these objects with any individual
species of Lepidodendron, and no subsequent attempt of importance has been made
to classify them. Many of the small fragments enclosed in nodules of clay iron-
stone, so often found at various localities, are not Lepidostrobi. ‘Too frequently they
are merely terminal portions of ordinary Lepidodendroid branches ; besides these,
true Lepidostrobi are not rare in such nodules, but the majority even of these are
nothing more than casts, from which all structure has disappeared.
