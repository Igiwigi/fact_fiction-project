of sulphocyanide of ethyl (146?, according to Canorss) and of sulphocyanide of allyl
(143?, according to Duwas and PrLouze; 1482, according to WILL; 151?, according to

Kore).

If, on comparing the parallel terms of different series of compounds, we do not quite

generally meet with the same difference in the boiling-points corresponding to the same

difference.in compoxsition, this fact arises from the cireumstance that the ame difference
in the formule by no means involves the same difference of boiling-point in all series of
homologous substances. For the series of the monatomic alcohols with two equivalents
of oxygen, of the monobasic acids with four equivalents of oxygen, of the ethers to which
both classes give rise, as well as for a few other series of homologous substances (see
Table VIIL.), the elementary difference x C, H, seems to involve a difference of boil-
ing-point 2x 19‚Äù; but there are other series of homologous bodies in which the same
elementary difference is positively attended by another, greater or smaller, difference of
boiling-point.

This difference is greater, for example, in the series of hydrocarbons CG, H,_; in which
it amounts to about 249.
