If t(VwC(w)) — T, then Vwr(C(w))  T follows. Hence, + tC(w)  T, which | 16 |
by induction hypothesis implies that C(w) 4+ ¥xA —> C(w). Thus,

o(VwC(w)) AE Vivo C() AF Wio(VXA(X) > C(w)) AE VXA(X) > VoC(). 1g
If H r(¥wC(w)) <> L, then the fact that t is a substitution implies that + r(WwC(w)) + Vwr(C(w)), : S
and that it is a ground substitution that k tC(w) 1 for some w. By the observation made in : 2

the first paragraph of the proof, rC(w) is equivalent to tC(s) for any sequence of terms s. Thus,
a C(w) 4+ VxA A C(w) by the induction hypothesis, which implies

a (WivC(i)) JE VeO(VEA(X) A C(®)) AE VEA(R) A VOC(@).
