sponding frequency. The product 2zan, representing the maximum velocity, is itself
an appropriate measure of the importance of the component, as the relative energies
for different components are proportional to (an)’.

In the present experiments the determination of the frequencies of the components
has been effected with all the accuracy desired, but as it has not yet been found possible
to avoid selective action due to resonance of diaphragms, the amplitudes of the com-
ponents are not faithfully represented. No attempt has been made to deduce the
absolute amplitudes of motion of the original vibration.

When the components of a vibration have strictly commensurable frequencies, as
in a harmonic series, the phase relations of the components are quite definite, and the
determination of the relative phases might be of value—in fact it would be necessary

if it were required to reconstruct the wave-form of the vibration. It would not be
difficult to adapt the method of analysis by interruption for the determination of phase-
difference, but no experiments in this direction have yet been made. Hence at present

‘the method is incomplete in that it fails to take account of wave-form. If the wave-
form were required it would appear simpler to deal with it directly by means of an
oscillograph method than to build it up from a complete analysis.
