reconstructed time series provide a larger test case database on which extreme or low-probability
occurrences can be detected.

Figure 9 shows total duration of free spans and durations of free spans over selected length
thresholds for the water depth 35m obtained with the reconstructed time series and compared
with the results obtained with the hindcasted ones. It can be noted that, even if the results with
the hindcasted series are close to the average values obtained by the reconstruction, the range
of variability of the reconstruction is much wider and provides a statistically more significant
sample.

Differently from permanent free spans caused by sea bottom unevenness, the evaluation of
the fatigue accumulated by an evolving free span should be calculated considering the actual
environment causing its development. In fact, as can be seen in figure 8, the main part of the
fatigue is accumulated during the last part of its life when its length is maximum and caused
