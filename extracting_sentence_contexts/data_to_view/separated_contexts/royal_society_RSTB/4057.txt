All the figures given in this paper go to show that in all reasonable probability
there is little to choose between species in their degree of adaptation to local
conditions. This comes out especially clearly in Table VI, where the whole of the
endemics, taken in groups of not less than 14, show rarity greater than the average
of the whole flora, and yet agree wonderfully closely among themselves in the degree
of rarity, which only ranges from 3-9 to 4°9. When one remembers that the figures
are not taken directly from facts, but from estimates, of observation, this regularity

is wonderful, and the regular order and progression of the figures goes to show that it
cannot be accidental. From these and other facts one may reasonably, it seems to me, conclude that in
the peopling of Ceylon with flowering plants the first species to appear, whether coming
from elsewhere or developed for the first time within the island—then probably still
attached to Southern India, if not also to Africa—were those which are now of wider
distribution than Ceylon or Ceylon and South India, They would find the island
presumably more or less covered with cryptogamic vegetation—just as Krakatoa was
at a certain period after the eruption—but they would begin to spread, and probably,
as their demands for food would, on the whole, be slightly different, they would
gradually cover large areas, and in time a great number of them would reach the
stage of commonness now represented by the expression VC, while those of them,
which from lack of adaptation, late arrival, or ill chance, only reached the stage then
represented by VR, would perhaps be at the stage of commonness now represented by
