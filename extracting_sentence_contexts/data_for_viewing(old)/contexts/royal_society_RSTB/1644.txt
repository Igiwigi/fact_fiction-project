the remarkelile structural modifications invelved in the forward dislocation of tle

anterior vertebrae and the associated portions of the Weheriun mechanism into the
cranial cavity, wd in the combination of » partially ossitied air-hladder with external
osseotts capsules, Wypophthahwus is mnique anong all S. abnormales which lave se
far buen deseribed, aud represents the extreme of a series of modifications of which
Toricarix wod its allies exhibit the initial stages.”

Tom the facts above-mentioned it may he voveluded: (1) That the Hyposton-
line and Hypophthalmime exlibil the most extreme modifications which the air
Walder, Weberian mechanism and the correlated skeletal elements undergo in the

ASiliride. (2) That, the modifications in question haye to some extent taken place
“in the same direction, so that the two groups possess certain features in common, aud,
Snotably, the firm sutural union, or even partial anchylosis of the anterior vertebra:
ariel the skull, and also, with one exception (cleduthievs), in the wode in which the
Husseous capsules for the air-bladder are formed; in the partial or complete atrophy
Sot the bony roof of the cayum sinus imparis; and in certain other features which
She two groups share with the less aberrant Siluride abnormales. (3) That the
Basceptional features so characteristic of certain gener, yid., the formation of complete
Bony capsules for the air-bladder by the actual ossification of its own walls in
