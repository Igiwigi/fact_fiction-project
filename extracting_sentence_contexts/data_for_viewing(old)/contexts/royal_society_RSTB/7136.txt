In all the cores examined the detritus silt is overlain by 2 to 5 cm. of grey clay containing
plant remains which forms the topmost deposit of Zone II. Plant remains, like the pollen,
are sparser in this clay than in the detritus silt, but the leaves of Polytrichum alpinum are
common, and the fruit and perianth segments of Oxyria digyna were found at the base of
this clay in one core (figure 12). Fruits of Carex and Scirpus spp. are also common. Oxyria

digyna is recorded by Jessen (1938) from Zone III at Ballybetagh; its present distribution
is markedly Arctic-Alpine. Its appearance here at the top of Zone II, accompanied by
Polytrichum alpinum, a mountain and moorland species, together with the fact that here the
N.T.P./T.P. ratio again becomes high, suggests that this 2 to 5 cm. of grey clay was deposited
under conditions colder than the preceding, when the climate was again becoming severe.
The grey clay is everywhere overlain by horizontally bedded laminated clay (Zone III),
showing that there were again glaciers in the drainage basin.

Correlation of this late-glacial detritus silt with the Allerad layer of north-western Europe which has
been recognized in Ireland. All the evidence from Windermere, from stratigraphy, pollen
analysis and macroscopic plant remains, supports the view that this detritus silt represents
a temporary period of relative warmth during the retreat of the ice-sheet. That this period
was not of interglacial magnitude is shown by the relative narrowness of its deposits
(maximum 50 cm.) and by the fact that it is overlain only by a comparatively thin deposit
of laminated (and therefore presumably waterlain) clay. This shows that there was no
