that of an PS microscope without interferometric detection. As such, we expect that six-beam
structured illumination provided by two opposing high-numerical-aperture objectives will be the
future method of choice for extended-resolution imaging when isotropic resolution is key.


16. Can light sheet microscopy and SIM, with multiple pattern orientations,
be properly combined?

As noted in §8, light sheet and SIM appear to be a perfect match: light sheet microscopy is limited
in resolution due to the relatively low numerical aperture objectives used, but generates very little
out-of-focus light—the bane of SIM. However, traditional light sheet SIM (LSFM-SIM) suffers
from the relatively coarse illumination pattern that can be provided by the excitation objective
in LSFM systems and the fact that only one orientation of the pattern is present. As such, while
improvements in axial resolution can be made, very little useful enhancement of lateral resolution
is possible.

In an attempt to counter these issues, Manton & Rees proposed an LSFM-SIM system featuring
three mutually orthogonal objectives [103]. However, the use of 0.8 NA objectives, necessary
for reasons of steric hindrance, meant that the maximum possible lateral resolution would still
only be around 230nm (i.e. approximately the theoretical resolution of a 1.1 NA water-dipping :
objective as used in some other light sheet microscope designs). While they also suggested the :=
use of interferometric excitation through two objectives to improve the resolution to 120nm, the :5
experimental complexity of such a system means that it is unlikely to ever be realized in practice. P
