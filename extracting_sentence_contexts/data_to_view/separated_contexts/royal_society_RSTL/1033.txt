These experiments were made by my directions under the
immediate care of Mr. RE1cHENBACH, commandant of the corps
of artificers in the Elector's military service, and of Count
Sexer?, first lieutenant in the regiment of artillery. Though I was prevented by ill health from being actually
present at all these experiments, yet being at hand, and having
every day, and almost every hour, regular reports of the pro-
gress that was made in them, and of every thing extraordinary
that happened, the experiments may be said with great truth
to have been made under my immediate direction; and as the
two gentlemen by whom I was assisted, were not only every
way qualified for such an undertaking, but had been present,
and had assisted me in a number of similar experiments which
I had myself made, they had acquired all that readiness and
dexterity in the various manipulations which are $0 useful and

necessary in experimental inquiries ; and I think I can safely 3
venture to say that the experiments may be depended upon,
It would have afforded me great satisfaction to have been able {

to say that the experiments were all made by myself; and I :
had resolved to repeat them before I made them public, parti-
cularly as there appear to have been some very extraordinary
and quite unaccountable differences in the results of those
made in different seasons of the year ; but having hitherto been
prevented by ill health, and by other avocations, from engag-


the Force of fired Gunpowder. 261

ing again in these laborious researches, I have thought it right
not to delay any longer the publication of facts, which appear
to me to be both new and interesting, as their publication
may perhaps excite others to engage in their farther inves-
tigation. 8

The principal objects I had in view in the following set of
experiments were, first, to determine the expansive force of
the elastic vapour generated in the combustion of gunpowder
in its various states of condensation, and to ascertain the ratio
of its elasticity to its density : and secondly, to measure, by
one decisive experiment, the utmost force of this fluid in its
most dense state; that is to say, when the powder completely
fills the space in which it is fired, and in which the generated
fAluid is confined. As these experiments were very numerous,
and as it will be more satisfactory to be able to sce all their
results at one cursory view, I have brought them into the form
of a general table.
