(d) Solution of the advection—diffusion problem in the fracture for At = 0(1)
andy > 1

For the moments of time of the order At=O(1) and y — 1, applying formula (3.17), equation
(3.12) can be converted to the following form:

ac + ac 1 CC
dt | aX Pe ax2

‘ ( + oF ) (3.29)
Owing to the fact that At=O(1), it is reasonable to introduce a new temporal variable T = At
in equation (3.29). For the values t= T/A, when T = O(1), the concentration front will move to a
distance greater than | along the fracture. Therefore, a new characteristic scale Xo for the variable
should be introduced. This scale can be found from comparison of the coefficients of the leading

terms at the considered moments of time. As a result, Xp =1/(A +6 A”). After the substitutions

xa*%, raat (3.30)
Xp ,

equation (3.29) will take the following form:
