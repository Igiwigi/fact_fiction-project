Jon Saltmarsh A lot of people are going to do that. The starting point is there has been a
lot of public engagement over the last 5 or 10 years. Taking the public
on a journey about climate change. If you go back 10-15 years people
didn’t actually accept that climate change was happening; there was a
huge debate about that and that engagement has been driven not just by
the government, but by the press, by pressure groups, and it has gradually
built up a ground swell of opinion. Now it’s much easier for people to
accept that something has got to be done, but generally people don’t
like that something to involve them changing the way they do things. So
you're absolutely right it’s going to be a huge challenge asking people to
switch to any new form of heating. Gas central heating has been a very
well optimized technology that works really well in the British climate
with British homes. The fact that 22 and a half million people are using
that is probably testament to the fact it works. Telling people that they
need to change the way they operate is going to be a huge problem. What
needs to be done is convincing people that this is the right way to travel,
and if people are finding heat pumps and a switch to hydrogen are a better
and more cost effective way of doing things perhaps that’s the way to
get people to move down that route. It stands at the moment as a very
difficult sell. It’s a long journey. Again, 2050 is the blink of an eye as
Dan [Sadler] pointed out on Monday. It’s going to be a challenge to move
people that far and that fast. The reason I think hydrogen is so interesting
is it allows people to continue using gas for heating and cooking. So in
terms of impact on the consumer having people coming in and saying
‘Right we have to change your appliances today but then you can go on
