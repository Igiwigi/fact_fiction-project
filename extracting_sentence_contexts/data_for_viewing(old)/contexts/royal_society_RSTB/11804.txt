In the case of our empirical analysis, there is phylogenetic
uncertainty associated with each of the three branch-length
metrics. For the cladogram, a primary concern is missing
taxaâ€”while our phylogeny represents almost every
described native plant species in California, it includes only
California species, and many terminals represent multiple
species. Both aspects will cause underestimation of
cladogram PD, which could be biased if missing taxa are
non-randomly distributed in space or on the phylogeny.
Assuming phylogenetic clustering at broad spatial scales
due to niche conservatism or dispersal limitation, the largest
bias from excluding non-California species would be
expected near the state borders; the fact that most areas
with high diversification relative to survival time occurred
near the state border runs counter to this expectation and
suggests this issue may not be unduly influencing the results.
Uncertainty in cladogram PD will decline as the extent and
resolution of phylogenies continue to rapidly improve in
future studies.

For the phylogram, a relatively small number of lineages
have notably long branches indicating rapid molecular
change. While there is inevitable uncertainty in inferred mol-
ecular branch lengths and their connection to functional
traits, the qualitative observation that the lineages with the
