If a colder and consolidated crust possesses a greater density and a smaller coefficient
of contraction than the liquid or solid but hotter matter beneath, by accretion and
solidification from which the crust is gradually thickened, it is easy to see that such a
relation may subsist between these quantities that the distance of the centre of gyration
of the globe from its centre of figure may remain constant, either always or for very long
Q periods, although the diameter of the earth as a whole may have diminished by con-
traction ; and thus, since the moment of momentum must have remained unchanged, the
5 angular velocity, upon which the length of the day depends, may have remained constant
& (or 50 nearly $0 that its variation may have been absolutely insensible) for 2000 years,
5 or perhaps for a much longer period, notwithstanding that the world, as a whole, may
> have been losing heat all the time at a very sensible rate per annum, as s8eems to be the
S undeniable fact.

5 46. Let us take up the train of phenomena of refrigeration from the period when we
Z may suppose the whole globe a liquid spheroid in fusion, rotating upon an axis inclined to
Z its orbit as now, losing heat by radiation, and receiving that of the sun. Whatever the
Srate of refrigeration generally, it must have been greatest towards the poles; s0 that any
'Z solidified crust must have first formed about the poles and spread thence in two hemi-
Z spherical sheets, getting thinner as they neared the equator, where they ultimately

S effects of our highest temperatures on metals and on the materials that we must pre-
Zsume constitute the mass of our globe, it is certain that, at temperatures exceeding their
= fusing-points, they become more and more liquid up to some not yet known limit, and
S that at points a good deal above those of fusion they are all reduced to mobile liquids
