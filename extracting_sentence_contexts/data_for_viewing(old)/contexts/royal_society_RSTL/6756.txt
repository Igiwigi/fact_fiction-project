gen of the decomposing nitrogenous body. Or, if it did act upon the latter in p
to the former, there would either be no free Nitrogen finally evolved, or, in case of
trogen being lost in the free state, it would be obvious that there had been less n;
Nitrogen converted into ammonia than had been liberated from its combinations,
hence that, as a resultant, there would be a loss and not a gain of combined Ny
due to the decomposition.

'The fact that, in our experiments upon the gas evolved by vegetable matters in a
of decompoxition, both free Nitrogen and free hydrogen were given off, bears
upon this question. The Nitrogen evolved has been. in most intimate contact, with
hydrogen given off. It has, indeed, been in the identical cells by the decompoxition Â©
the walls or contents of which the hydrogen was set free; yet both appear as gas. 7

From the above considerations it would appear that we need be under little appre
hension of error in the results of our experiments on the question of the assimilation
of free Nitrogen by plants, arising from an unaccounted supply of ammonia formed under |
the influence of nascent hydrogen, given off in any decompoxsition of the organic matter
involved in the experiment. ;
