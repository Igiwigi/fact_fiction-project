Table 1. An analysis of psychological strategies for responding to the prospects of severe climate
change (after [26]).

types strategies brief description
denial active denial resolves cognitive dissonance by actively rejecting
strategies scientific claims
casual denial avoiding exposure to and dismissing uncomfortable

facts with the assistance of narratives about

scientific uncertainty or errors

maladaptive reinterpreting the threat by making its scale seem smaller or its timeframe
coping distant, people ‘de-problematize’ the threat
strategies diversionary strategies appropriate thoughts and actions are displaced by
positive but trivial actions (such as installing
low-energy light bulbs) or by pleasure-seeking
blame-shifting responsibility is disavowed by blaming others for the
problem. For example, China has become a popular
scapegoat for global warming
indifference strategies deliberate apathy can reduce short-term pressures but
may exact a heavy psychological toll
‘benign fictions’ lead us to predict what we would
optimism/wishful prefer to see. Such unrealistic optimism becomes
thinking maladaptive when healthy illusions refuse to
respond to external evidence and become delusions

unrealist:

adaptive expressing and feelings of anger, despair and hopelessness are natural
coping controlling emotions in the circumstances. Emotion-focused coping
strategies requires that we express these feelings but do not
become ‘stuck’ in them
problem-solving finding out more about a threat may alleviate anxicty.
