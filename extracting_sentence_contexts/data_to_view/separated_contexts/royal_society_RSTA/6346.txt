It is necessary to stress that the effect of a CO2 on leaf stomatal conductance is still
affected by strong uncertainties and influenced by other factors, including the radiative
effects of CO, [61]. Moreover, ESMs show substantial overestimation of this effect [102] that
could bias drought estimations based on metrics that include ET or soil moisture, but also
metrics based on AED and precipitation could be affected by land-atmosphere feedbacks. Thus, ET limitation by increased a CO contradicts observations since ET has increased in
the last few decades [103], a period characterized by a high increase in a COz; there are
also studies supporting the fact that ET has been primarily driven by climate trends, with
only a minor role played by a CO [104]. Moreover, climate warming may have an impact
on plant processes that are not included in ESMs, such as water loss from leaf cuticule
[105,106], which is independent of stomatal responses to a CO). Finally, land use and vegetation
changes severely affect land transpiration, and these are either highly uncertain in current
ESMs (e.g. the leaf area index [107]) or not included [108].
