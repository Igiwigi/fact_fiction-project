A possible exception to this general statement is the human molar tooth found in

Erserince, Junr., Curator of the Australian Museum (16), has collected certain data.
which point to the fact that this tooth was “taken from the solid breccia of
Wellington Cave,” and, further, that other parts of a human skeleton were found
under similar circumstances by Krerrr. The evidence of this tooth, should it be
accepted, is clear proof of the existence of Man in Australia in Pleistocene times, and
there is no question as to the authenticity of the document upon which the validity
of this statement now rests.

However, in addition to the tooth from Wellington Caves and the Talgai
fossil, other evidence of a very important character has been submitted by
Mr. ErneripGe (17). He has demonstrated beyond all doubt, from an examination
of the Post-Tertiary deposits of the same cave in New South Wales, that the Dog
(probably Canis dingo) existed on this continent, contemporaneous with the extinct
Pleistocene Thylacine and Diprotodon, and has confirmed the results of earlier
