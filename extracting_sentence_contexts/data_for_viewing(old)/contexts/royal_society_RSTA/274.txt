as can be seen by eye (figure 4a; the variance tends to rise and then fall on
orogressing through the dataset).

These trends in variance in palaeodata can potentially be linked to trends
in noise level. The rise in variance in the GISP2 data might be attributable to
deglaciation causing pulses of freshwater forcing that in turn drove increased
fluctuations in the Atlantic thermohaline circulation and hence Greenland
climate. Increased likelihood of a noise-induced transition can come with
increased fluctuations, consistent with the hypothesis that the BA was basically
noise-induced [13]. In contrast, the decline in variance during the Younger Dryas
in the Cariaco basin data could reflect declining fluctuations in freshwater forcing
of the Atlantic as Northern Hemisphere ice sheets re-stabilized during this cold
interval. The fact that an abrupt transition still occurred at the end of the
Younger Dryas, despite declining noise level, may strengthen the case for an
underlying bifurcation. However, the effect of noise on the likelihood of transitions
depends on whether noise is multiplied by, or added to, the state variable of a
system [37].

Overall, the DFA method appears to give the least ambiguous results (table 1).
However, this may simply reflect the fact that only the sliding window length
is varied in the DFA method, whereas for the ACF method and the variance
calculation, filtering bandwidth is also varied, and this tends to cause greater
variation in the sign of the Kendall trend statistic.
