A five-item scale (adapted from [61]; see electronic supplemen-
tary material) was used to validate group assignment (e.g. ‘I
am politically more in line with the Democratic Party than the
Republican Party’—‘Strongly disagree, 0’ to ‘Strongly agree, 6’).

(c) Procedure

The study was administered using Qualtrics software (Qualtrics,
Provo, UT, USA). Participants were presented with an ethically
approved information sheet, before completing demographics
and being presented with the scenario, with each statement pre-
sented separately for a predetermined time (set at approx. 150 ms
per word). Participants were not made aware of the fictional
nature of the report (nor was it explicitly labelled as real), but
were simply asked to read it carefully. After a 1 min distractor
task (a word puzzle), the test questionnaire was administered,
before participants completed the party-preference scale. Finally,
participants were asked if they had put ina reasonable effort or if
their data should be discarded, and were then debriefed; this
included a clarification that the report was fictitious.
