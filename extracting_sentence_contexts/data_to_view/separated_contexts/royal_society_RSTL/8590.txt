No change of this kind occurs at 100?, although the experi-
ments were carried to 224 atmospheres. The explanation of this change in the value
of p, after a certain pressure has been reached, I have already anticipated when referring
to a similar change in the coefficient of expansion by heat at high pressures, as 8hown
in Table VIII. At the temperature of 64, and under a pressure of 223 atmospheres,
carbonic acid has in fact approached the liquid volume, while passing through those
intermediate conditions of matter which, in a former Bakerian Lecture, I have described
as establishing an unbroken continuity between the ordinary gaseous and ordinary liquid
states. At 100* carbonic acid under the same external pressure has not reached this
stage of the process; but if the experiment had been carried to higher pressures, a like
change in the value of Ã¾ would no doubt have occurred. 'These remarks will be fully
confirmed when 1 give the values of p for the gaseous and liquid states at the same tem-
perature, as calculated from my former experiments*. The true import of the values
of p at a constant temperature will be considered hereafter.
