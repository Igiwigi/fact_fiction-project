Figure 25. (T;, ¢’) curves for the records of figures 22a and 226,
T,, = period of the groups which are dominant at time ?’.

The values of ¢’ included in the (f,?’) curve of figure 23 range between ¢’ = 230 usec.
and ¢’ = 330 psec. For vibrations of the first mode, the duration, at x = 115 cm., of a
disturbance originating in an infinitely thin pulse at the pressure end of the bar is about
1-64 x 230 = 378 ysec., whilst the duration of the impact of the bullet is about 35 psec. ; the
duration of the disturbance, allowing for the finite time of impact of the bullet, is thus about
413 usec. The curve of figure 23 would therefore have to extend to ¢’ = 643 ysec. in order to
include the whole of the disturbance, and, as figure 25 shows, the actual record in fact covers

only the main pulse and the initial stages of the tail, as far as vibrations in the first mode are
concerned. The (77, ¢’) curve (1st mode) will show two or more values of T;, for each value of ¢’

q when ¢' > 1-735 x 230>399 ysec., so that the record stops short even of this point. It follows

that if the vibrations excited by the bullet impact belong to the first mode, then the whole of

the tail appearing in figure 23 should be composed of simple harmonic vibrations gradually
