of the air has been ascertained, that the height of the liquid in Q is noted, that the
barometric pressure has been observyed, and that the height of the column of water
above the surface in the reservoir has been also measured. If now a current of hot
water of known temperature is led through the tube C, the lower surface of A at once
assumes and is continually maintained at a known temperature. The heat gradually

* Held obliquely, the image of a straight line een on the base of the cons coincides with a straight edgo,

+ It is noteworthy how remarkably the cohesive preeminence of water appears in these experiments. Other
Tiquids can be obtained in disks of 4 millims. to 5 millims. only with great care: water may be got in disks of
8 millims., or eyen 12 millims, It will be remembered that T have elsewhere shown that of all liquids water has
the greatest drop-8ize (Proceedings, Royal Society, 1864). This fact is also to be attributed to the superiority
of that liquid in cohesion,

travels downward through the liquid L, warms the platinum face of B, expands the air
in B, and depresses the water in Q.

through A is shown in fig. 3, Plate LXV. A tinned iron cylindrical vessel containing the
water, 1, about 1 metre high and 30 centims. diameter, is heated by a gas-lamp, 2. The
gas supplying the lamp passes through the thermostat, 3. Supported near the bottom
