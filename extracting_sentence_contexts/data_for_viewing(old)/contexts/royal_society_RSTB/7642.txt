this.

Flowers might appear superficially to provide the most obvious examples of polygonal
symmetry, and it is probable that there are many species for which this “waves round a ring’
theory is essentially correct. But it is certain that it does not apply for all species. If it did it
would follow that, taking flowers as a whole, i.e. mixing up all species, there would be no
very markedly preferred petal (or corolla, segment, stamen, etc.) numbers. For when all
species are taken into account one must expect that the diameters of the rings concerned
will take on nearly all values within a considerable range, and that neighbouring diameters
will be almost equally common. There may also be some variation in chemical wave-length.
Neighbouring values of the ratio circumferences to wave-length should therefore be more
or less equally frequent, and this must mean that neighbouring petal numbers will have
much the same frequency. But this is not borne out by the facts. The number five is extremely
common, and the number seven rather rare. Such facts are, in the author’s opinion, capable
of explanation on the basis of morphogen theory, and are closely connected with the theory
of phyllotaxis. They cannot be considered in detail here.

The case of a filament of tissue calls for some comment. The equilibrium patterns on
such a filament will be the same as on a ring, which has been cut at a point where the
concentrations of the morphogens are a maximum or a minimum. This could account for the
segmentation of such filaments. It should be noticed, however, that the theory will not apply
unmodified for filaments immersed in water.
