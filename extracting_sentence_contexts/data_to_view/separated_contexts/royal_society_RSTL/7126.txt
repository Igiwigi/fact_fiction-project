786 SIR B. C. BRODIE ON THE CALCULUS OF CHEMICAL, OPERATIONS. It is frequently asserted that our present hypothesis affords a clear and simple expla-
nation of chemical phenomena, which is the evidence of its truth. Now it may be con-
sidered that such an explanation was perhaps afforded of the incomplete system of facts
known to Darron, but with our present knowledge this account can no longer be
regarded as satisfactory. The most important feature in our modern system is the
identification of the weight of the chemical molecule with the weight of the unit of
gaseous volume, to which we are brought by physical as well as chemical considerations. This great simplification was practically introduced by LauURExNT and GERHARDY, and it
is generally allowed that this assumption affords the snrest basis of chemical theory.
