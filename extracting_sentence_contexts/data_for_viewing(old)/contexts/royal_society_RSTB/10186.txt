in well-defined modules composed by a subset of seed-
© plots that received more seeds from the mother trees in the
same module than from those outside this module. Indeed,
the resulting modules can be seen as bottom-up classifi-

Le [56,58,59]. This modular structure describes how variability
° is mapped in space, in contrast with dominant approaches

looking at whether there is a significant variability [56].
° The observed modular organization was caused neither
by distance nor by the microhabitat type of the seed-plots.
In fact, these two variables were partly accounted for when
constructing the networks. As seed-plots receiving no seeds
were not included in the networks (because they could not
be linked to a mother tree), we excluded a priori those seed-
plots avoided by frugivores. Indeed, these were mostly
either located in microhabitats known to be avoided by
birds (e.g. open ground, G), or at some distance from the fruit-
ing trees [15,60]. The remaining subset of seed-plots included
n=14 in the networks were thus inherently a combination of

50m ° favoured microhabitat and distance [60].
