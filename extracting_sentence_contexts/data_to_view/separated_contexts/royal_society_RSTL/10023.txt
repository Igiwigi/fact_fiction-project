first exci-
tatory variation, 4.e., one to one-and-a-half second after the closure of the current. But if the experiment is made at a low temperature (18* to 20* C.) this event does
not happen until after the third, fourth, or fifth variation. To observe these facts
the current of a GRovE cell is led through one lobe, while the other is led off (in
the usual way, to the electrometer, and the time after closure of the circuit noted by
the watch, as in the following experiments :—

I. Current of one Grove from above downwards for half a minute ; excitatory
variation at 3”, 9”, 13”, 19”, 23”, 30”. Same current directed upwards—variation at closure only. TI.
