quantity of sulphuric acid than the normal, and the samples from the eastern part of the
region nearer to the African coast have a proportion of sulphuric acid which is con-
siderably greater than the normal quantity. Does this depend upon the more prevailing
volcanic character of the west coast of Africa compared to the east coast of America ?
Thirteenth Region. The sea between Africa and the Bast Indian Islands.—The mean
of this region is 33-868, but it is deduced from observations that have given very different
results. The maximum (35-802) is from 31-54 S. lat., 72* 37' E. long., about midway
between the Cape of Good Hope and Australia, Now in the North Atlantic Ocean
even the mean salinity between 30? and 99? N. lat. is 35-932, thus greater than the
maximum in this region, though this maximum 1s from near 32* S. lat. The fact is
Striking. The minimum (25:879) is from a place high up in the Bay of Bengal, and of
Rourse highly influenced by the vast quantity of water from the Ganges. It lies, how-
Sver, about 300 English miles from the month of the Ganges; and another specimen
Srom N. lat. 17? 20', and about sixty miles nearer the mouth of the Ganges, has 32-365
Ser 1000 salt, 8 that it seems as if some other cause has also been operating to weaken
She 8ea-water at the minimum place.
Z Fourteenth Region. The 80a between the south-east coast of Asia, the East Indian
'Felands, and the Aleutic Islands.—The mean quantity of salt, deduced from seven com-
Slete analyses, is 33:506, the maximum from a place to the south-east of Japan, in

* 31' N. lat., is only 34'234, less than the maximum of the German Ocean between
{ 60' N. lat., and surrounded by land (35-041). The minimum (32-370) between the
