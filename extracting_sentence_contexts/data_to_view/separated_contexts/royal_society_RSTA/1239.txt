Maximal estimates in the setting of UMD
spaces are covered in [13] and the follow-up works [10,11]. Maximal inequalities for stochastic
convolutions in 2-smooth Banach spaces with respect to other noise processes than (cylindrical)
Brownian motions, such as Poissonian noise, are discussed in [14-16] and the references therein;
see also survey [17] for the Hilbertian case. An important motivation to study stochastic partial differential equations in the setting of
2-smooth Banach spaces comes from the fact that estimates in Sobolev and Besov spaces with
high integrability exponent p (which are 2-smooth) can be combined with Sobolev embedding
results to obtain further integrability and regularity properties of solutions. This plays a key role
in many papers (see [8,9] and references therein).

2. Preliminaries

We assume familiarity with the basic notions of probability theory and stochastic analysis.
