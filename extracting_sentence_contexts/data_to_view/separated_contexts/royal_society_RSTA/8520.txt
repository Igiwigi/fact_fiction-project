The Mozambique Channel. The channel between Madagascar and the mainland is mostly about 500 fathoms
deep or more. There are few records of tidal currents in it; in fact the only record
given in the ‘ African Pilot,’ part 3, appears to be based on the statement of a single
observer, that the tidal streams in the channel are comparable with the permanent
current driven by the trade winds, which flows at about 2 knots. This cannot
however be uniform all over the channel, for the following reason. The height of the
tide along the African coast is about 12 feet, which is as usual measured relative to
low water at ordinary springs, so that the vertical amplitude of the tide is 180 cm.
