a somewhat rudimentary condition, and the integumental pores 8eem wanting altogethen;
it therefore seems possible that the snperadded lateral vessels met with in these animals
may in 80me way be connected with the function of respirationF.

ORGANS OF GENERATION.

I have comparatively little to say on this sabject. There is no particular discrepaney
in the accounts given of these structures by different obseryers; their general form and
arrangement is pretty well known, and nothing more was likely to be learned from them
which would be of material assistance in determining the affinities of the Nematoids. I
have therefore not made these organs the subject of any systematic investigation, and
in addition to pointing out their prevailing form in the free Nematoids, have only a few
scattered facts to mention under this head.

In the * Monograph on the Anguillulide,” I called particular attention to the fact of
the great uniformity in the disposition of these organs amongst the free Nematoids, and
stated that for this amongst other reasons it seemed to me desirable to locate them in
family altogether distinct from those into which the parasitic species are divided, sinee
in only two or three exceptional parasitic species is the same arrangement met with.

The form and position of these organsf, in both the male and female Dorylaumus sfag-
nalis, T have represented in Plate XXVIIL. figs. 1 & 2, and this may be considered as

* Really Dorylaimus palustris. Vide Ann. of Nat. Hist. Ser. 3, yol. iv. Þ- 38, pl. 2, fig. 7.
