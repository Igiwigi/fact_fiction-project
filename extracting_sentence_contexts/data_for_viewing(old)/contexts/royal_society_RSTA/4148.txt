(ii) Random matrix theory model

We use here the approach of constructing the average density matrix proposed in [14] rather
than calculating properties for each member of the ensemble and averaging these properties
afterwards. For details, see [15,16]. Let us assume that the master equation derived above is
of Lindblad form with a single Lindblad operator Vi. Then, we may choose Cy =1 without
restriction. Let us further assume that V{ is a fixed member of the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble
(GOE) or the Gaussian unitary ensemble (GUE). This may be justified for an environment
dominated by chaotic dynamics or disorder. The Born-Markov approximation used above
implies some coarse-graining in time, i.e. averaging over a small time interval. Assuming
ergodicity, this averaging may be replaced by averaging over the random matrix ensemble. In
the case of the Gaussian ensembles, it is then enough to use the fact that (Veg Von) = 5jx5it (GUE)


or (Veg Von) = djx5it + 5ik5;1 (GOE) to arrive at the following very simple master equation:

ihdroe(t) = Hxoelt) — oelt)Hy — ih fect - tet} , (2.19)

The dissipation term of this equation had been obtained previously for a random matrix model
where the coupling matrix is a full random matrix in the product Hilbert space of the near and
far environment [14]. Note that equation (2.12) implies

fir (8) = troelt) = trel[M,(Hée(1)], My (t) = Uo(t)"U. (0). (2.20)
