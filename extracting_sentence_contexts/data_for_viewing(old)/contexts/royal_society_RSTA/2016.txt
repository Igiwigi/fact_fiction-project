The historian Melinda Baldwin opined in her 2014 paper [12] that the ‘strong scientific relationship between Tyndall and
Stokes has likely eluded the attention of scholars’, a view that I argue in this paper might extend to many other of Stokes’s
scientific correspondents.


relevant submission are assessed and compared to the historical credit afforded him. The measure
of such influence is generally found to be far the greater of the two. I examine here only three
case studies of the many available, two of which relate to eminent physicists of the Victorian era
with extensive published biographical histories in which Stokes’s part, given the evidence below,
seems curiously understated [13].”

The final case study relates to a less well-known scientist—in fact a chemist, so outside
Stokes’s generally recognized sphere of expertise—but on whom Stokes’s impact was nonetheless
formative in terms of his published oeuvre. This case demonstrates the extraordinary lengths
to which Stokes would go to support, guide and occasionally direct in ways that were not
always ultimately fruitful nor (it might be inferred) wholly appreciated. The completeness of
the historical record of this correspondence, which is as far as I know unexamined from this
perspective, provides insight into the vicarious means (and the extraordinary investment of time
and effort) by which Stokes sought to extend scientific knowledge, even sometimes in a minor
way, through his work with other scientists.

Of all Stokes’s several cordial relationships with other scientists, undoubtedly the most significant
