diameter; we shall thus be enabled to consider the radiation as composed of plane-
waves travelling at right angles to their own wave fronts. Furthermore, the amount
of gas is to be so small that the emission is not sensibly affected by absorption. The
gas is to consist of molecules all having the same period of free vibration.

§ 38. The light received by the spectator will not be homogeneous. One reason

. for this is the Doppler effect.t The velocities of the molecules in the line of sight will
alter the period of the light received. Another cause will doubtless be the altered
vibrations of two molecules when very near to one another. This will perhaps become
important at high pressures, but we will not further consider it at present.

§ 39. Lastly, we have to take into account the fact that the train of single waves
emitted by each vibrating molecule is not infinite in length, but has a definite
beginning and ending. ‘The effect of this cause is investigated below. The Doppler
effect is included in the same piece of analysis. We shall arrive at the remarkable
result that the limiting width of the spectrum line when the pressure is indefinitely
diminished is less by some 10 per cent. than the width calculated by Lord Ray.eicu,
who took into account nothing but the Doppler effect.

§ 40. The vibration of a molecule will be altered by collision with another. The
velocity will also be altered, in both magnitude and direction. The vibration
received by the spectator from this molecule will therefore be suddenly and
fortuitously altered in period, amplitude and phase. The total radiation received
