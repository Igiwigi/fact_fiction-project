Z have all its roots real, then it may be expresxed by a superlinear form of which the number of terms will be
[=] 27+1 or 24, according as the degree is 4i+1 or 4i—1, In the one case the number of real roots cannot exceed

2i+1, in the other 2i—1, Hence the following somewhat curious theorem :

(*) If the canonizant of an odd-degreed quantic in x, y, of the degree 4i+1, has no imaginary roots, the quan-
tic itself must have at Teast i pairs of imaginary roots, From the fact that when the roots of the canonizant ofa
quintic are all real there must be one pair at least of imaginary roots, we can infer that when the discriminant
of a quintic is positive and that of its canonizant is negative, the equation has one real and four imaginary roots.
This obseryation has led to a long train of reflections, which will be found embodied in the 3rd part of the
memoir,

() This, in fact, is identical in 8ubstance with the noted problem of determining the chance that two straight
lines drawn on a black board will cross. Mr. Caxrey, of whom it may be 80 truly said, whether the matter
he takes in hand be great or small, © nihil tetigit quod non ornavit,” suggests the following independent proof
of this. Taking unity as the length of the contour, fixing the extremity of one of the lines, and calling s the
distance of its other end from it measured on the contour, the chance of the second line crogsing this is- easily
8een to be 2s(1—s), which, integrated between 8=0, 8=1, gives 4, as before obtained,
