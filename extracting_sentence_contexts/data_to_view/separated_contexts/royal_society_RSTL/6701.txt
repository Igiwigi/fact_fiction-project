The fibres do not grow out from the cells, but are formed
as two masses of germinal matter gradually separate from each other. But new gan-
glion-cells, nerve-fibres, and nuclei are being constantly produced, not only in fully deve-
loped young animals, and in the adult, but certainly for a considerable time after the
animal has arrived at maturity, and I believe almost to the close of the ordinary period
of life. A young cell, a fully formed cell, and an old cell are represented in figs. 2, 3, & 4,
magnified 700 diameters.

* This question has been fully considered in my lecture © On the Structure and Growth of the Simple
Tissues,” delivered at the Royal College of Physicians in 1860; and the general conclusions then arrived at, and
since confirmed by other obseryations, will be found to be strongly supported by facts recounted in this paper.


548 PROFESSOR BEALE ON THE STRUCTURE OF THE $0-CALLED

In the fully developed frog, ganglia are formed,

1. From a nucleated granular mass like that seen in the embryo, but continuous with
nerye-fibres.

2. By the division and splitting up of a mass like a ganglion-cell.

3.
