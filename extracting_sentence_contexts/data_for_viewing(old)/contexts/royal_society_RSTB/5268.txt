Introduction,

The genetical peculiarities of the genus Oenothera have long been recognized, but
further work will, no doubt, reveal similar conditions in other groups. The immense
amount of genetical work done with the Oenotheras by DE Vries (1913) and many others
has given a body of data unequalled in any other group of plants. Every phase of the
life history has been intensively investigated (see GarEs, 1928) and the results of great
numbers of species- and variety-crosses are known. ‘lwo of the most striking pecu-
larities discovered by DE Vries (1907) and confirmed by others (GATES, 1913) were
(1) the occurrence of twin types in the F, of crosses between different species, and
(2) the fact that many of the I, forms produced by crossing breed true or segregate
in only one or two characters.

By crossing, numbers of Oenothera species have been analyzed, particularly by
RENNER (1925), into two * complexes,” both of which may be active in different egg
cells of the plant, but frequently only one of them is functional in the pollen. The basis
of this failure of Oenothera hybrids to segregate in Mendelian fashion has long been
obscure, but it is now becoming clear that it has a cytological basis in the linkage of
the chromosomes during meiosis, which is a common feature of Oenothera species,
mutations, and hybrids. It is only necessary here to mention that each species has its
characteristic linkage arrangements, and that fresh linkages different from those of the
parents occur in the mutations of Oe. Lamarckiana and also in hybrids between different
species. It is to be anticipated that the more numerous such chromosome linkages
