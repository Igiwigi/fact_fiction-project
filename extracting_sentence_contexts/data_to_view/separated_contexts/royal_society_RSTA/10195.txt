It is difficult to see why the value of the modulus of rigidity obtained by Barner
is so much lower than those found by the other observers. BARrnerr states that the
fibres used by him were much thicker than those used by Boys or THRELFALL, and
that it is probable that the rigidity of fine fibres, like the breaking weight per unit
area of cross-section, increases as the diameter decreases.* This, however, is not
borne out by the fact that some of the fibres used by THRELFALL were very nearly
of the same diameter as some of those used by Barnerr. Boys and Taretrat both
found considerable variations between the values of the rigidity modulus obtained
from different fibres. These observers used a high-power microscope to measure the
diameter of the fibres directly, and THreLFau states that “it is impossible to be
sure of the thickness of threads of about ‘015 centim. diameter within less than
3 or 4 per cent. by a single measurement.” It is therefore probable that the
discrepancies found were largely due to an inaccurate knowledge of the radius of the
fibres used ; indeed, it must have required great skill in experimenting, and patience
in taking many observations of the diameters, in order to obtain as good an
agreement as that given.
