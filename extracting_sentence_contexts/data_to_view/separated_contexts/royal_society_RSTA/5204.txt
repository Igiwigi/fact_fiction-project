I have found that the explosion-wave is sooner initiated when electrolytic gas is
largely diluted with oxygen than when it is diluted with the same volume of
nitrogen ; a fact which explains the apparent anomaly in BrrrHEnor’s experiments. On repeating my measurements of the rate of explosion of electrolytic gas with
large volumes of diluent gases, some discrepancies were found, which could not at
first be explained. A tube of larger diameter (13 mm.) was then substituted for the
smaller tube (9 mm.).
