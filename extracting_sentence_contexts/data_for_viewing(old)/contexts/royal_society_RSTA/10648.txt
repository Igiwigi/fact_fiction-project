potential fall. This follows from the fact that the investigation had for its first aim
the production of a margin, and not the determination of the limits of voltage within
which this may be produced.

Two of the boundaries previously referred to for which no satisfactory conditions

could be found are the x Cl and us Cl. From Table IL. it is seen that for this pair

of solutions no change in potential slope is brought about. The densities and
refractive indices of the two solutions, however, differ very considerably. Perhaps it
is on this account that it is possible to obtain an indistinct and undulating refraction
margin whether the Li follows Mg or Mg Li; but in neither case is the velocity
constant. This is undoubtedly due to the fact that, since there exists no difference in
potential fall at the two sides of the margin, there is no controlling force which shall
prevent the faster ion diffusing into the slower, or vice versd. Diffusion therefore
takes place, the resistances become slightly altered, and so also the potential fall and
velocities. A similar case is that of the 0°5 N a SO, margin. Here, with a low
voltage, a mixed colour boundary, which cannot be located nearer than perhaps
1-2 millims., results; but when the voltage is increased, a sharp colour boundary
ultimately appears at about 6°5 volts, and from the table it is seen that even with
7 volts the change in potential slope only amounts to 0°30 volt. That no refraction
margin can be detected with this pair of solutions at this concentration (such a margin
is obtained in more concentrated solutions) is explained by the circumstance that the
refractive indices of the two solutions lie very close together. Nernst, in describing
the experiment previously quoted, refers to the necessity for a high voltage that will
