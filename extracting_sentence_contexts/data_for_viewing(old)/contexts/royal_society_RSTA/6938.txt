for a comprehensive survey.

From an examination of the curves of residuals, it will be seen that the first peak of the
surge took approximately 1h to travel from Southend to London Bridge, and was reduced
in magnitude from 7-2 to 7-0 ft. The second peak took 5h to travel and was reduced from
7-5 to 6-0 ft.

The first peak occurred at Southend approximately 2h before the predicted time of
high water there, whereas the second peak was an hour earlier than the following pre-

icted low water. The large difference between the two rates of travel would appear to be
Belated to the state of the tide in the Thames, and from qualitative considerations is in
§onformity with the established fact that low waters are retarded to a greater extent than
Sigh waters in shallow rivers. Thus the a.m. high water was predicted as taking 1h 25min
fo travel from Southend to London Bridge, whereas the following low water was expected
‘p take 2h.
‘m Another notable feature of the curve for London Bridge is the exceedingly steep initial

Hise.
