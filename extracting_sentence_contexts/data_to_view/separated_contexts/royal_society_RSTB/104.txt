Sections through young and actively growing tubercles show that the hyphw branch
and pass from cell to cell throughout the meristem of the interior (figs. 7-18). In
very young tubercles the cells contain only these hyphz ; subsequently, when the
tubercle reaches the dimensions of a mustard-seed, the tiny bacterium-like bodies begin
to accumulate. In sections through very young tubercles, made transversely to the long ax’s of the
root, and passing axially through the tubercle, I have observed the following facts. A fairly strong hypha, several times thicker than the cell-walls in many cases, can be
traced through from the epiderinis to the origin of the young tubercle (figs. 7, 8, 9) ;
the tip of the tubercle is always directed so as to meet this hypha. I had frequently satisfied myself of this fact, before more fortunate preparations
showed the facts explained by figs. 9 and 13, Here, as is seen, the hypha referred
to passes down the cavity of a root-hair, and thence traverses the cortex of the root,
cell by cell, beginning to branch when it enters the mass of tissue which constitutes
the young tubercle.
