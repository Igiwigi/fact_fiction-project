11. A simplified treatment will have value in the early stages of computation. It is
clear that y will vary much faster with # than with a, and y, if not faster, at least not much
more slowly. This means that the f-differentials will predominate in (19), so that without
serious error we may suppress the «-differentials to obtain

al 7) =0, whence x i const. = A (say). (24)

Equally 0/08 will predominate over y-/dx in the expression (22) for p’2q’, so that without
serious error* we may suppress the «-differential to obtain

waey =p'q. (25) ©

* Here, in fact, the error is of second order when (@y/8x)/(@/r/2B) is small (cf. § 22).
