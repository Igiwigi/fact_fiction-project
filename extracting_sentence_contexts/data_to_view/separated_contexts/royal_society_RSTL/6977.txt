Geo. J, RuMsy,”

Dr. MUELLER, in transmitting me the foregoing copy of the Gold-Receiver's letter,
writes (November 25th, 1864), © Since writing to you by last mail I have received the
enclosed letter respecting the Ornithorhynchus having proved to be * oviparous.” How are
all these statements to be reconciled ?”

As8uming the fact of the ovipogition, in the month of December 1863 (Dr. NicnoLs0N
writes of the occurrence as having happened < about ten months” before the date of his
letter, September 21, 1864) by a female Ornithorhynchus, of two ova, about the size of a
crow's egg, © white, soft, compressible, without shell or anything approaching to a calca-
reous covering,” the question is—What did they contain? Had the unvascular chorion
been cut or torn open, an embryo or a yelk might have been seen. Better till would it
have been if both ova had been at once immersed in a bottle of whatever colourless

| alcoholic liquor might be at hand.
