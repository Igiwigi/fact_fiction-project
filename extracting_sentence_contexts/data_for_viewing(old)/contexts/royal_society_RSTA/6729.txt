Let I’ be any field of prime characteristic p, and

where @, #,, and the Z, (<> 1) are algebraically independent over I’. It is clear that G = F(Y,)
is inseparable of degree p over F;; the pth power of any element of G belongs to /*. Further, put

need to postulate that I has infinitely many elements.) The fact that the degree of Q over § is 1 was pointed
out in footnote 44h of Krull (19396).

See Krull (1932) for the relevant general valuation theory. On the valuation theory of algebraic extension-
fields, cf. Krull (1935), nn. 48, 40; Ostrowski (1934), n. 30 (finiteness of the ‘Verzweigungsindex’). Reference
may also be made to Theorems 7 and 8 of Krull (1936).
