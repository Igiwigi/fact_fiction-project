Stars more massive than about 8Mo end their lives
as incredibly luminous explosions known as core-
Sean M. Couch collapse supernovae (CCSNe). Observationally, this
e-mail: couchsea@msu.edu is a fact. We have directly observed massive stars
erupt into CCSNe and then disappear after the
explosion has faded. The most famous case of direct
observation is SN 1987A [1], but we have now
directly identified a few dozen CCSN progenitors [2,3].
Theoretically, explaining the mechanism that drives
these massive stellar explosions, however, has been
a challenge. In this brief review, I will give an
overview of the investigation into the CCSN mechanism
with a particular focus on recent results in three
dimensions (3D). This is a very broad topic and so the
present review will not be exhaustive. The particularly
inquisitive reader should also see more complete
