He admits the force of MicHEtsonâ€™s
arguments, but shows how by assuming that the plates of chitin have a definite
structure, they may give strong interference colours, and yet reflect polarized light in
the manner of metallic films. He is confirmed in his opinion by the weakness of the
transmission colours, which in the case of surface colours, should always be stronger
than those reflected. The fact that many of these discussions are so theoretical suggested the present
work, which mainly consists in an examination of the minute structure of a number of
iridescent objects. It was hoped that this might supply evidence which would help
to decide the true explanation, As was expected, the enormous diversity of form
makes any general theory quite impossible. It is, therefore, essential that any type
of structure should be considered on its own merits, and for this purpose many
microscopical sections are described and figured.
