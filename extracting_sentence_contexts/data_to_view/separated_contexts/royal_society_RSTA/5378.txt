similarity. Species clustering was reported, but for interaction functions rather
different from the Gaussian used in Scheffer & van Nes (2006). In fact, for the
Gaussian interaction case most results are extremely sensitive to details such as
the implementation of the boundary conditions or weak ecological second-order
effects (Pigolotti et al. 2008). Thus, a clarification of the mechanisms leading to
species clustering in LV models would be desirable. In addition, the results in
Pigolotti et al. (2007, 2008) were obtained under the unrealistic assumption of
homogeneity in niche space, whereas the inhomogeneities in the carrying capacity
are known to play relevant roles (Szabé & Meszéna 2006).
