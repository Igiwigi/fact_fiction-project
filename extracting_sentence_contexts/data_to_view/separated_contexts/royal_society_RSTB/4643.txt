(a) Position of the Wing and Scales.—This has a considerable effect on the colour,
especially that of iridescent insects ; for not only does the angle that the surface of the
wing makes with the line of vision alter the colour, but in many cases the appearance of
the insect will be totally changed according as the observer looks at the wing parallel to
the neryures, or at right angles to them. Similarly, if the observer looks parallel to the
neryures, but from the apex of the wing to the base, the colour may be quite different
from that seen when looking from the base towards the apex. This is generally due
to the fact that the scales are not always set in the same plane as the surface of the
wing, but are frequently inclined to it at a definite angle. Thus, though an observer
is holding the wing at right angles to his line of vision, the scales may still make an

angle with it. In the case of Ornithoptera poseidon and others, there are two dark
velvety patches on the forewings, which owe their appearance partly to the angle at
which the scales are attached to the wing, but chiefly to the fact that the scales form
rows which run at right angles to the nervures instead of parallel, as do the other scales.
