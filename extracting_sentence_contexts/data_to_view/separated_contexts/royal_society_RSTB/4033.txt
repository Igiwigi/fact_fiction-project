All the figures given in this paper go to show that in all reasonable probability
there is little to choose between species in their degree of adaptation to local
conditions. This comes out especially clearly in Table VI, where the whole of the
endemics, taken in groups of not less than 14, show rarity greater than the average
of the whole flora, and yet agree wonderfully closely among themselves in the degree
