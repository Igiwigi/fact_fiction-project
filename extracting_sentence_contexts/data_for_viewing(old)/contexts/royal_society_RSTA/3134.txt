It is well known that first approximation jg is reasonably close to the exact value, in
particular for hard spheres [1,18]. This fact, however, does not imply that corresponding
eigenfunctions of the linearized Boltzmann collision integral are in any sense ‘close’ to
those for Maxwell’s molecules, and it is therefore misleading to judge on the quality of
Grad’s approximation for hard spheres on the basis of viscosity coefficient alone. We shall
return to this discussion later.

We now continue with finalizing Grad’s G13 approximation by writing down closed-form
equations.

(c) Grad’s system

Substituting Grad’s closure relations for the Q- and T-fluxes (3.8) and (3.11) into balance equations
(2.17) and (2.18), and also using any of the above realizations of the relaxation terms, one arrives
