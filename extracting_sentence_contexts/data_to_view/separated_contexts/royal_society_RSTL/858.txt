He told me, he could not recollect having heard or read
of any other instance, excepting one in the Memoirs written by
the Emperor JEHANGIRE, and of that he did not recollect the
particulars. A few days after, having found the passage in the
original Persian, he was 80 obliging as to translate it. I consider
it as an authentic fact; for the Emperor JenanGirE was not a
prince on whom his courtiers would idly venture to impose;
and there can be little probability that an Aumil of a district
should invent such a story, or be able to produce a substance
apparently like iron, but which, on trial, differed from manufac-
tured iron. Colonel KiRKPATRICK'S translation, I have obtained
his leave to communicate, with his attestation, to the Royal
Society. Extract from the Memoirs of the Emperor Jehangire, written (in
Persian ) by himself, and translated by Colonel Kirkpatrick.
