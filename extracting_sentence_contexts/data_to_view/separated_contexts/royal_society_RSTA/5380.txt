But the numerical results in Pigolotti et al. (2007)
indicate that it is stable for some values of L and d. We finally stress that the appearance of the lumped solution is not a
consequence of the singularity of the delta function in the kernel. In fact, any
kernel sufficiently peaked at the origin will favour the coexistence of close species. If the behaviour at larger distances of the kernel makes it not positive definite,
then full coexistence will be unstable and the natural solution will split into
disjoint lumps. An example of the final steady state in this situation is shown in
figure 4, with a kernel G= Gao + 0.894.095 which has the properties just described
and contains no delta singularity.
