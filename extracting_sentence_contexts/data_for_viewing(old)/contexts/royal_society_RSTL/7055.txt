organisms ; and in the valley of the Seine we have recently found freshwater shells in the

low-level valley-gravels of Rouen. At the same time a subsidence 80 regulated as to be

exactly proportioned to the accumulation of river sediment and to keep onl the sea is
very difficult to imagine, and is certainly not supported by the facts.

What T propose to show is, on the contrary, that the brick-earth is intimately associ-
ated with all the valley-gravels and is contemporaneous with and dependent upon them
from the beginning to the end of the series, the higher deposits having been formed
before the excavation of the valleys, and those on the lower terraces being of later date.

T have said that in the valley of the Somme the high-level gravels rise to the height
of 100 feet above the river; and from some recent obseryations I conclude that there are

f some beds which attain a height of 150 feet. Now, if we take this latter level as having
been the floor of the valley through which the river flowed at the period when these
S gravels were deposited, we shall find the Loess still extending to about 60 or 80 feet
