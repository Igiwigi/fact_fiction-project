If we search among modern microbes and their metab-
olism for ancient physiological phenotypes, the acetogens
and methanogens stand out [44,109]. These obtain their
energy from making organic compounds out of CO. In

fact, they are often diazotrophic and as such they just live lutionary step; it is a far less problematic increment than the

from gases: CO, CO, Hp, N> and H,S. At the level of overall urdles that had to be surmounted at the origin of the ribosome
chemical similarity, core carbon and energy metabolism in and the code [110,117].

methanogens and acetogens has quite a lot in common
with geochemical processes at alkaline hydrothermal vents
[43], and that is probably not coincidence. Again, we have little to contribute to the nature of an RNA-
like world [98], other than the insights that it probably arose in
the same environment where the acetyl-CoA pathway did, a
setting full of amino acids, reactive C; moieties and CO2, and
that molecular fossils of that environment might be preserved
in RNA base modifications today.
