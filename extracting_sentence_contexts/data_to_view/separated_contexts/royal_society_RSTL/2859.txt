It may be necessary to premise a notice of the method of calculation adopted in
the present communication, as it differs from that employed in my two former papers. That method consisted in finding, in the first instance, by a tentative process, (vir-
tually equivalent to assuming the two extreme indices from obseryation,) the funda-
mental are 0, from which the others were derived on dividing by 2 for each ray, 80 as
to fulfill the conditions of the approximate formula

It also appears from the investigations given in seyeral consecutive papers in the
London and Edinburgh Journal of Science, &c., that this formula is in fact obtained
by supposing the sum of a series of analogous terms collected into one, with a com-
mon constant coefficient H. This simplified hypothesis (from the accordances already

obtained) is evidently very near the truth for the whole range of media hitherto

examined. Professor Sir W. R. HamiLrox afterwards pointed out (besides a direct process for
performing this approximate calculation) a method of investigating the exact expres-
sion when we do not allow the above 7-7 as to the coefficients, viz.
