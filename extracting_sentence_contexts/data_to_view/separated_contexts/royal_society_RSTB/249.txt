Again, in a degenerating electric organ, we should expect the electric plate to be
incomplete, and the nerves passing to it few in number or undergoing retrogressiv
changes ; and one would further expect to find some indication of degeneration of
less essential layers. But in R. radiata there is a relatively large bunch of well
