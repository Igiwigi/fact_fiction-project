The posterior
portion is the true posterior column, and the line of demarcation is distinct on the sur-
face without a transverse section, in consequence of the posterior roots of the spinal
nerves emerging at that point. All that portion of the cord which is anterior to this
posterior lateral fissure not being divided in a similar way may be called the antero-
lateral column. From the antero-lateral column of the cord there are two sets of fibres ascending
to the cerebellum, one from the anterior portion of the antero-lateral column, the
other from the posterior. 'The posterior set of fibres are separated from the posterior
columns by the posterior peaks of gray matter ; and judging from the fact that the
sensory division of the fifth pair of nervyes is continuous with these fibres, it appears
most probable they form part of the sensory tract. See Plate XXXVIII. fig. 2. 1. The anterior set, the cerebellic fibres of the anterior columns Þ, proceed from the
front and sides of the cord, continuous therefore with the true motor tract.
