In
the case of values other than X,, say, Â¢.g., \: parameters, all the axes of any aggregate
depend on the particular \ value. In the case of \,, however, they ure independent
of the particular 4,. In fact, the successive \, aggregates may be built up by taking
any one and putting outside of this a suitable vortex shell. Moreover, the values of
the axes for the A, roots are the crests, and bottoms, of the J curve, and so are
important for their own sakes. L 2
