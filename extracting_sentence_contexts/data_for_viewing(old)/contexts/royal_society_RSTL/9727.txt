8treams are present in all vacuum discharges, and that their behaviour under various
:Seonditions of vacuum and discharge, s0 far from pointing to any unusual state of
-=the gaseous medium in which they occur, shows a perfect continuity of variation
- s*hroughout the whole of the wide range of circumstances under which they appear.
= Tt will be convenient in demonstrating these propositions to show first of all that
Sphosphorescence can be produced in vacuum tubes, in which it would not otherwise
-Soceur, by increasing the violence of the discharge. By far the best example of this is
-2obtained in the way to which we have just referred, viz. : by introducing an air-spark.
lf a tube of very moderate exhaust be placed in circuit with a large HoLTz machine,
Sand an air-spark of considerable size be introduced into any part of the circuit, it will
generally be found that phosphorescence appears in the neighbourhood of the negative
-Sterminal, even though there was not the slightest appearance of it while the discharge
'Swas passing continuously. This is clearly due to the fact that intermittent discharges
"are necessarily much more violent during the very short period of time which they
= occupy than are continuous discharges ; and hence the velocity imparted to the mole-
'Seular streams is sufficient to make them impinge on the glass with the velocity requisite
<=to produce phosphorescence. TI will be noticed that we have here no change in the
Z degree of exhaustion, but only in the violence of the discharge ; and it is further to be
Qremarked that this increased violence can be obtained, either directly as in the case
— of the negative air-spark, or by way of response to a violent positive discharge in
- the tube, as in the case of the poxitive air-spark.*
But it is not only thus that the introduction of an air-spark can be made to produce
© Phosphorescence in a vacuum tube. Tt is possible to obtain similar phosphorescence
- in other portions of the tube than those immediately surrounding the negative
© terminal, and it is by these methods that we can show most clearly that the pheno-
