The slip-lines run transversely across the surface of the walls of the thin-
walled cells or are inclined at a high angle (more than 45°) in the thick-walled cells. In both cases the lines run obliquely in the section of the wall, but at an angle of
more than 45°, to the long axis of the cell. The displacement for compression failures is thus never along the planes of the
slits of the pits, and, except for the fact that the inclination of the slip-planes to the
direction of stress is always greater than 45°, the behaviour of the material of
the walls is such as might be expected from an isotropic substance. The anisotropy of the cell-walls, as regards their mechanical properties, is more
striking in connection with the different behaviour in tension and compression. It is
well known that the strength of wood is much greater in longitudinal tension than
in end-compression.
