rates become less predictable, it has a smaller effect on
evolution.

3. Selection and transmission with multiple

traits

By highlighting the importance of the relationship between
offspring phenotype and relative fitness, equations (1.1) and
(2.2) remind us that transmission plays as important a role
in evolution as does selection. Unfortunately, these equations,
as written, make it difficult to tease apart the contributions of
transmission and selection. In fact, both selection and trans-
mission are wrapped up in both the first and second term
on the right-hand side of equation (2.2).

We thus seek results that are as universal as equation (2.2)
but more clearly illuminate different biological processes
involving both transmission and selection. To achieve this
goal, we need to be able to write both offspring phenotype
(¢°) and relative fitness (Q) as functions of parental pheno-
type (¢). The problem here is not just to capture the
distribution of variation in a population, which has been
approached by using deviations from the normal distribution
[4] or using cumulant methods [5], but to construct a space
