studied the question, that the truth was somewhere revealed. But if in pursuance of
this impression he were induced to enter upon the work of collating results and con-
clusions, he would find such contradictory evidence, such equilibrium of opinion,
such variation and combination of theory, as would leave him in complete doubt re-
specting what, he should accept as the true interpretation of nature: he would be
forced to take upon himself the labour of repeating and examining the facts, and
then use his own judgment on them in preference to that of others,

876. This state of the subject must, to those who have made up their minds on the
matter, be my apology for entering upon its investigation. The views I have taken
of the definite action of electricity in decomposing bodies (783.), and the identity of
the power 80 used with the power to be overcome (855.), founded not on a mere
opinion or general notion, but on facts which, being altogether new, were to my mind
precise and conclusive, gave me, as I conceived, the power of examining the question
with adyantages not before possessed by any, and which might compensate, on my
part, for the superior clearness and extent of intellect on theirs. Such are the con-
siderations which have induced me to suppose I might help in deciding the question,
and be able to render assistance in that great service of removing doub{ful knowledge.
Such knowledge is the early morning light of eyery adyancing science, and is essential
to its development ; but the man who is engaged in dispelling that which is deceptive
