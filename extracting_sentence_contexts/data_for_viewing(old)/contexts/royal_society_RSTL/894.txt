the spar was taken from the fire, a great number of the
vesicles burst with a noise similar to that which accompanies
the bursting of the indusium. of the fern, and carried off a
portion of the thin calcareous. pellicle. When this, pellicle
* was removed, the subjacent surface was covered with a-series
of minute parallel grooves inclined about 20* 57 to the
short diagonal. In repeating this experiment, and seizing
the proper time for withdrawing the spar from the fire, I

have never failed toobserve the fact of the arrangement
and bursting of the vesicles, and I have no hesitation-in con-
cluding, that the carbonic acid is arranged in planes passing
through the axis of the crystal, a result-which I had for-
merly assumed in explaining the phenomena of double re-
fraction. This method of studying the structure of bodies by
watching them in the process of disintegration, may be found
to have a very extensive application in chemical and. mine-
ralogical enquiries.

The observyations contained in the preceding pages, indicate
in a manner by no means equivocal, that the colouring par-
