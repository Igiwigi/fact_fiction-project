considerably in different localities in ancient days, and that the form and finish of
the implements made must often be determined by the greater or less size of the
flint nodules available, and also by their abundance. Thus we should be wrong to
conclude that large and well-trimmed flint implements necessarily imply that their
makers were more advanced in culture than other groups of workers in flint—who,
in other localities, made smaller implements of rougher and readier workmanship.
The Pre-Crag men of the Icenian area had the finest flints in the world to
serve as their material—nowhere else are such huge nodules of fine unflawed flint
accessible in such abundance. The men who made the flat amygdaloid and the
large triquetro-hastate flint implements (usually referred to by the unmeaning
term “coups de poing”) of the river gravels of the south of England and north of
France probably had access to good-sized flint nodules from the chalk. Though
these are not such fine masses as those of East Anglia, the fact that there is no
trace in the river-gravel industry of the “ rostro-carinate” type of implement, and
no trace in the Pre-Crag horizon of the flattened or “ foliiform” type, whether
amygdaloid or hastate, makes it clear that the men of these two industries were
independent and separate. Whether they were separated in place only, or also by
geologic time, remains for discussion. We cannot attribute the difference of their
types of implement to a difference of material.

When, however, we come to a comparison of the Pre-Crag implements with the
industry discovered by Mr. Bensamin Harrison in the high plateau gravel above
Ightham, in Kent—which are often referred to by the now useless word “ eoliths”
indiscriminately applied to all sorts of flint fragments of most varied age and
provenance—we have to remember, in the first place, that the age of this high
