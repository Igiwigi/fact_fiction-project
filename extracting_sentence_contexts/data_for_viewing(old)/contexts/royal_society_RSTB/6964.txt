well in the diagrams from southern Sweden, Denmark and western Europe generally,
although, hitherto, special attention has not been called to it.

Phase b is marked by the oak pollen values exceeding those of the elm, and by the
continued absence of lime except in single samples. The alder, if present, is limited to
low values. The pine values are lower than in phase a, but the hazel values, after
falling from the peak in phase a, show other maxima.

Phase c¢ continues to show oak and elm in the proportions of phase , but here lime
appears as a continuous curve which steadily rises into the following period: at the end
of phase c lime pollen may exceed that of oak or elm. The alder values begin to rise
during phase ¢, and rise rapidly at the end. Pine, however, shows a strong tendency to
a secondary maximum in this phase, a fact probably attributable to a local dryness of

the bog surfaces which allowed pines to grow upon them. If this is so we may expect
the horizon sometimes to show other maxima, e.g. birch or even alder, or to have
pollen spectra obscured by pollen destruction. It seems reasonable to recognize this
phase as the “Boreal Wasserstandminimum” of continental writers. During phase c
the hazel generally shows diminishing values.

Throughout all three parts of zone VI birch is present only in small amounts in this
area, but where it occurs it is most abundant in the older phases, and diminishes
