This agrees with the comparison of the two thermometers ab
Jhe atmospheric pressure and in a vacuum. At the same time, other readings of
Fhermometer C were s8omewhat variable, and it was therefore deemed advisable to
Assume that the zero-point of C in Series IL. was 7*:23. That this is 80 is shown by
Bhe fact that, taking this number as correct, the differences between the two thermo-
Fnoters disappeared at 0% But even if 7*13 were accepted as the zero-point of C it
Zrould not materially aftect our results. Z 32. The experiments were conducted in the following manner: â€”Water was admitted
Zo as to moisten the cotton-wool of both thermometers.
