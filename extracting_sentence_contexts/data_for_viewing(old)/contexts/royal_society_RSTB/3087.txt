of drying this loses two-thirds of its weight, the amount of extract used would
represent only two-thirds of a cubic centimetre of the 1-per-cent. extract of the dried
gland which we have usually employed. The same thing is illustrated in other
tracings (figs. 8, 10, 13, 14), which all show a marked result of small doses. On the
other hand, where we have obtained a diminution of urine, as has sometimes been
the case in dogs and rabbits, we have generally used larger doses (4 cc, of
a 1-per-cent. extract of the dried gland). In these animals, also, even if the extract
produces diuresis with the first two or three doses, a frequently-repeated adminis-
tration is apt eventually to produce decrease or arrest of urine. On the other hand,
in the cat this condition is much more difficult to produce, each successive dose being
responded to by an increase of rate of flow, even when a considerable number are
given at intervals of a few minutes (fig. 5). The fact that within certain limits the
kidneys are more responsive to a small than to a large dose of the extract is in
consonance with the view that the pituitary produces a secretion which is discharged
into the blood and subserves a diuretic function. For, with so small a gland, it is
impossible to suppose that a large amount of secretion could be produced, and
a constant small production would appear from our results to be more effective
in this respect than the introduction into the blood of a larger proportion of the
active material.

Effects of Injecting Pituitary Extract Hypodermically.

We have made four experiments (on cats) to determine whether the physiological
and especially the diuretic effects of the extract could be obtained by hypodermic
