BErzELIUs and PoxTiN, and in a
note attached to this communication, I ventured to controvert
an opinion of M. M. Gay Lussac and THENARD, with respect
to the agency of potassium and ammonia, even on their own
statement of facts, as detailed in the Moniteur for May 27,
1808,

The general obscurity belonging to these refined objects of
research, their importance and connection with the whole of
chemical theory, have induced me since that time to apply to
them no inconsiderable degree of labour and attention ; and
the results of my inquiries will, I trust, be found not only to
confirm my former conclusions ; but likewise to offer some
novel views. In the first of these series of operations on the action of
potassium on ammonia, I used retorts of green glass ; I then
suspecting oxygene might be derived from the metallic oxides
in the green glass, employed retorts of plate glass, and last
of all, I fastened the potassium upon trays of platina, or iron,
which were introduced into the glass retorts furnished with
stop cocks. These retorts were exhausted by an excellent air
pump, they were filled with hydrogene, exhausted a second
time, and then filled with ammonia from an appropriate mer-
curial gas holder.* In this way the gas was operated upon
in a high degree of purity, which was always ascertained ;
and all the operations performed out of the contact of mer-
cury, water, or any substances that could interfere with the
results.
