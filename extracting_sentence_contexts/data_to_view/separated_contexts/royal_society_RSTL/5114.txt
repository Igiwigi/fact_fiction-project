But even if they tended to show that the power of volition is not transmitted
by these columns, they by no means prove it to be communicated by the grey sub-
stance, Since a deep incision into the latter would divide not only many fibres of the
anterior roots extending upwards, but a portion also of the lateral white columns
into which these roots are prolonged. That the grey substance of the chord does transmit impressions from one side to
the other, has been fully proved by the experiments of Vax Deegx and STHaixG ; and
the means by which the communication is effected is satisfactorily explained by the
structure of the transverse commissure described by both STILLING and myself*, 1
believe, however, that the fibres of this commissure do not form a distinct set con-
necting the grey substance of one side with that of the other, but that they are all
continuous with the roots of the nerves and the white columns. From certain facts, then, described in this communication, it would appear that
the white columns are mainly constituted of fibres derived from both roots of the
nerves. It is true that the processes of some of the vesicles situated near the margin
of the grey substance may be seen to extend into these columns, with fibres of which
they perhaps are continuous ; and it is not improbable that others more deeply seated
may have the same connection. But if there be, as some physiologists believe, a

* The structure immediately surrounding the spinal canal is described by STILLING as a circular commis$ure
compoxed of fine grey fibres.
