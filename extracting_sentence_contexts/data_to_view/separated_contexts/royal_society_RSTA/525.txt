It should be emphasized that depending on plasma composition, different processes
are responsible for combustion enhancement owing to exposure of the reacting mixture to an
electric discharge.

3. Key reactions and chain mechanism development upon production of singlet
oxygen molecules in some important oxy-fuel systems

(a) Hy—O) system

Historically, the investigations of key reactions responsible for the acceleration of chain process
due to production of singlet oxygen molecules started, originally, for the H2—Oz mixture. This
is caused, firstly, by the fact that this system is the simplest one among the other combustible
oxy-fuel systems and, secondly, that the kinetics of the oxidation process in such a mixture is on
the basis of the reaction mechanisms of the ignition and combustion of different hydrocarbons. As was revealed on the basis of ab initio calculations [7,39,40], the principal chain-initiation
reaction in the H7—O? mixture is the reaction

Hy +O; =H + HO, (3.1)

which produces highly reactive atomic hydrogen. Then, the H atom reacts with HOz and
produces OH radical

H + HO; =20H. (3.2)

A very fast reaction is the reaction of the H atom with molecular oxygen
H+0O2=O0OH+0. (3.3)

This process is one of the chain-branching reactions responsible for the chain mechanism
development in the H)—Op(air) mixture.
