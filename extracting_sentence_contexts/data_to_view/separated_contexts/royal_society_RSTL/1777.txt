This law may be announced
in the following terms :

The quantity of the Respiration is inversely as the degree of the Irritability of
the muscular fibre. It will be necessary, in the very first place, to define the terms which I
am about to employ. The expression inverse ratio is not used in its strict,
mathematical sense, but merely to designate the general fact, that, in cases in
which the quantity of respiration is great, the degree of irritability is low ;
and that in cases in which the quantity of respiration is small, the degree of irri-
tability is high. By the quantity of respiration, I mean the quantity of oxygen
gas consumed, or exchanged for carbonic acid, in a given time, by the animal
confined in atmospheric air. I have used the term irritability in the sense in
which it is employed by G11sson and Haruer,â€”to designate that peculiar pro-
perty of the muscular fibre by which it contracts on the application of an
appropriate stimulus ; and I consider that muscle the most irritable which,
cxteris paribus, contracts most and longest upon the application of the least
degree of such stimulus.
