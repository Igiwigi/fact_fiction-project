Zr (nya, + vyft_») = a V (Sun Ch Ey

where V,(dnx%mn) differs from V(d,.4m,) Only in the central row, all the elements
of which are zero save those on either side the centre (7 = 1 and r = —1), which are
respectively equal to », and ». This follows from the fact that

sor =0 (r ¥ 1), agr-=1\(r= 1). Again, from (5°21), we may prove in the usual way that

IV (te Omn
~ F(nlmn)

_)

where V, and V are the same, except that in the 7 column of V, all the elements are
zero save those on either side the centre (7.¢., » = + 0) which are unity. If in
V and V, we add half of each of the rows n = + 0 to the centre row; and subtract
this new centre row from the rows n = + 0, V becomes transformed into V (,,b'nn),
where U’,,, = b,,,, except when n = + 0, while

(5°38) B’no = 4(Bmo—On—0)
