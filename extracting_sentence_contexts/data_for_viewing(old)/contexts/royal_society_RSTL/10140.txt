that an influence different from pure absorption came here into play. That
nence was convection.

S Anxious to probe this matter tof, the bottom, and to abolish, or account for, the
Elifferences between my friend and myself, I wrote to him proposing an exchange of
Apparatusâ€”that he should send his to London, and I mine to Berlin. TI afterwards
had a fac-simile of his apparatus constructed in London, and satisfied myself by actual
trial that it was really hampered with the defects I had ascribed to it. By means of
the striz> of incense 8moke and of chloride of ammonium, the fact of convection in air
was rendered plainly visible to the eye, while the behaviour of hydrogen, under like
cireumstances, revealed the cause of its transporting more heat than the vacuum in the
first, experiments, and less heat, not only than the vacuum, but than air or oxygen, in
the second experiments. In the one case, the thermometer, being close to the source,
came within the range of the convection currents of this mobile gas, the heat being
\  transported to it by these currents. In the other case, a considerable distance inter-
- vened between the source and the pile, which was further effectually protected by the
