from the air-spark terminal ; and that in the non-relief-effect there is a pulse to the
tinfoil of the same kind as the electricity which is discharged from that terminal.
* Tf ib is necessary to give an experimental proof for a conclusion 80 obyious, it is sufficient to connect
this portion of the cireuit to earth, placing a telephone in circuit, when the air-spark note will disbinetly
be heard, showing that there are periodic variations of potential accompanying each spark,

The first takes place at the moment thab the electricity in the tube passes the spot
where the tinfoil is; the second keeps time with the charging-up of the terminal
which leads to the discharge, and is therefore mos intense at the moment of
discharge. And, further, we have the experimental fact thab under ordinary cireum-
stances these effects are of a diametrically opposite kind.

This is, perhaps, the most suitable place for explaining the connexion between
intermittence and sensitiveness in vacuum discharges. The effects observed in
sensitive discharges have been traced in the preceding part of the paper to the
effect of static induction from the free electricity that passes into the tube at each
pulse. Now, in order that this static induction outside the tube may be strong, ib
is clearly necessary that the quantity of free electricity within the tube while the
discharge is passing should be great. In other words, the current mus pass in large
pulses and not in driblets. This is exactly whab intermittence effects. The electricity
is penned back until ib has accumulated in large quantities, and then in one pulse it
bursts into and s8weeps through the tube. In the 80-called continuous current, also, the
