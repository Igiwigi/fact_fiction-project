forms, certain of the external factors act through the intermediation of the nervous
system, and the evidence bearing on this subject I propose to discuss presently. Apart, however, from these factors and from the exteroceptive factors which are
dependent on the animals themselves—the stimuli of sight, hearing, smell, and sexual
contact, as well as lactation and (in birds) incubation—it is evident that sexual
periodicity is conditioned by the general environment, just as all vital processes are so
conditioned, and that food supply is of prime importance. This latter fact was
recognized by AristoTLe who remarks that where the weather is warm and fine and
food is abundant sheep may have young twice a year. Wesee a similar effect, partly,
in the increased polyoestrum of so many of the domestic animals. The practice of
“flushing” sheep, that is, supplying them with extra food—corn, cake, or turnips, or
turning them out on a good new ley, rape or mustard, or merely superior pasture, is
well known, not merely to increase the crop of lambs, but to hasten forward the
sexual season.
