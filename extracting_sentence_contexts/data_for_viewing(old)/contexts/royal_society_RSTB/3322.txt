Scuumann (11), KonKwrrz (12), and Cetraxovsky (13). The branch arises at a
very early stage in the terminal bud of the main stem, as a lump of tissue separated
from the leaf below by a mere line, so that it may be described as axillary. This
primordium stretches for some distance up towards the actual apex of the main stem,
sometimes beyond the first, second, or even third leaf above. Subsequent
elongation of the main stem causes this elevation of tissue to be longitudinally
extended and the branch ultimately to be inserted apparently at a considerable
distance above the subtending leaf, It is obvious that if the branch arises on a
portion of the main stem that has not ceased to elongate, the relatively earlier its time
of origin or the higher its position of origin on the main growing point the relatively
greater will be its apparent upward displacement, always assuming that the inter-
nodes at the point concerned grow with equal vigour. But precocity of origin is also
indicated by the fact that the branches are more displaced the relatively or absolutely
earlier they sprout. In the cases investigated in this paper, the upper branches are
basipetal in order of shooting out, and it is the basal branches on the main stem that
shoot out late and are not displaced from the leaf-axil. The gradual creeping of the
branch-primordium up the main growing point reaches a climax in the Boraginacez
when it extends to the actual tip, and a dichotomous dichasium seems to result, or a

dichasium in which the true termination (a flower) seems to be carried up one arm of
the dichasium as in Myosotis.
