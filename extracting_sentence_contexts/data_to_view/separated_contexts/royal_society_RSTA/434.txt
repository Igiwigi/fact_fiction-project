A paper about this
now-becoming-interesting determination appears in these proceedings.)

While the measurement accuracy of little g has increased by eight orders of magnitude during
its 400-year measurement history, the measurement accuracy of big G has only increased by three
orders of magnitude during its 300-year measurement history. Why, you might ask, has big G’s
accuracy not benefitted from a similar sort of increase? I think the reason rests with the fact that
the concomitant ‘noise sources’ have stood their ground (not gotten any smaller) and as such,
they continue to hide the really small ‘big’ G signal. On the other hand, little g’s sea of systematic
problems does not appear until one reaches today’s obtained accuracies of a few parts in 10°. Accordingly, from this time forward, further increases in the accuracy with which little g can be
measured will be hard won.
