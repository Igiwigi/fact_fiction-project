Many shells are composed entirely either of the rhombic crystalline or of
the concretionary structure ; but-I know only of a single instance (and that
occurs in the tube of a shell,) in which the whole mass affects the prismatic
crystalline structure. In all other shells of this latter texture, the inner and
front part, which is occupied by the body of the animal, is always covered with
a coat of the laminar concretionary texture.

4. On the Power possessed by Mollusca of dissolving Shells, Rocks, Sec.

It has been generally believed, and indeed sometimes most positively as-
serted, that Molluscous animals do not possess the power of reabsorbing the
matter of their shells when once deposited. 'The following observations, I think,
will distinetly prove that this theory is quite unsupported by fact.

If a Cone, an Olive, or any shell whose last whorl almost completely enve-
lopes and protects the rest, and whose cavity is much compressed, allowing
only a small space for the conyolutions of the body of the animal, be slit down,
either from the apex to the front of the axis, or across the body yolution, at a
little distance before the suture, it will be observed that all the septa between
the different whorls are extremely thin and transparent ; and when these septa
