besides, points to’ the rupture of the neck, although the method fails to afford the
actual shapes and dimensions in this last stage of development.

He is able to prove conclusively that the cylinder of pear-shaped section is stable,
and it is important in connection with our present investigation to note that he finds
no evidence of any break in the stability of that cylinder up to its division into two

a parts.
“ The stability of Mactauri’s and of the shorter Jacobian ellipsoids is, of course,
2 well established, and I imagined that the pear-shaped figure with incipient furrowing
2 was also proved to be stable. But M. Lrapounorr now statest that he is able to
a prove the pear- -shaped figure to be unstable from the beginning, and he attributes the
= ~ discrepancy between our conclusions to the fact that my result depended on the
8 =, Supposed rapid convergency of an infinite series, of which only a few terms were
a computed, The terms computed diminish rapidly, and it seemed to me evident that
2° the rapid diminution must éontinue, so that I feel unable to accept the hypothesis
<7 that the sum of the neglected terms could possibly amount to the very considerable
8 total which would be necessary to reverse my conclusion. I am, therefore, still of
opinion that the pear-shaped figure is stable at the beginning ; and this view receives
2 a powerful confirmation from Mr. JEAns’s researches. The final decision must await
4 the publication of M. Lrapounorr’s investigation.
5 But there is another difficulty raised by the present paper. I had fully expected to

& conclusive against its stability. The weightless pipe joining two bulbs of fluid is
