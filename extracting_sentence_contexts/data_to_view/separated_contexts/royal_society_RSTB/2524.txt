degenerates into spasmodic inspiratory movements, which precede death. Although
these facts are sufficiently apparent, it may be further demonstrated by the use of a
diaphragm needle that the contractions of this muscle become much reduced as
poisoning progresses, so that towards the end they assume the character of unsustained
twitches. Lethal Dose.

‘0000465 gramme of pseudaconitine per kilogramme body weight is a proportion
which is almost uniformly lethal to rabbits, but downwards to ‘000038 gramme
death may occasionally take place, especially if the viscera are loaded with food or
the animal is not carefully sheltered from cold. Whilst there is no invariable symptom which enables an observer to separate the
action of one alkaloid from the other with certainty, it has nevertheless become clear
from contrasting many experimental results that acceleration of respiration as an
initial feature of pseudaconitine action is not so usual, nor when occurring so
pronounced, as it is after aconitine.
