The mechanism involved in this alteration of wave-length is not known, nor
shat is going on at the surface of the advancing reflector ; and it seems to be a very
meertain step to assume that when terms of the second order are included, this effect
mn the wave-length is not subject to correction. As the circumstances of the reflexion

are thus not known with sufficient exactness, it is necessary to fall back on general

nciples. Now Professor Lopce has emphasized the fact that, when a beam of light

"averses a complete circuit in a medium containing moving bodies but devoid of

gnetic intensity, the change of phase produced by their motion is null to the first

der of small quantities. If it were exactly null, or null to the second order, the

sult of MicHELsoN would follow ; and it would seem also that Micnetson’s result
