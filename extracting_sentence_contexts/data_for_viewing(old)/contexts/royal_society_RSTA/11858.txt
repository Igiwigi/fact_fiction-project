so that

It is easy to show that ([+2), ([+8),... ([4n) are each of them factors of the
right-hand side ; the remaining factor is free from /, and is, in fact, the lattice function
L(o, 2, n).

Giving / to the special value zero, we readily find

L (=, 2, n) = Re),

GF (1, 2, n) = (41) {(4+2) ... (+ n)}? (14-041)
. (1){@)..(@)}#@+1)

and thence

as was to be shown.
