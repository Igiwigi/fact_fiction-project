response to stimuli, some researchers proposed the inclusion of higher order gradients in the
basic postulates of elasticity [16-18]. First, when referring to these new postulates the materials
were called non-simple, but now the theories including the second gradient of the displacement
(or the second gradient of the volume fraction field, or both of them) in the set of independent
constitutive variables are called strain gradient theories.

On the other hand, a lot of attention has been paid recently to the Moore-Gibson-Thompson
(MGT) equation, which arises in acoustics and accounts for the second sound effects and the
associated thermal relaxation in viscous fluids [19-21]. Some authors track the MGT equation
until the work of Stokes [22]. Regardless of its first appearance, the use of the MGT equation in
the viscoelasticity theory seems to produce a model which is considered to be more faithful to
reality than the usual Kelvin-Voigt (KV) model for the linear deformations of a viscoelastic solid
[23-25]. In fact, the linear KV viscoelasticity allows the instantaneous propagation of the
mechanical waves (see [26], p. 39), which contradicts the causality principle. However, the waves
in the MGT equation propagate with finite velocity [27].

In this work, we study a linear porous-elastic problem including three possible MGT
dissipation mechanisms: two of them assumed to be on the displacement (leading to the
viscoelasticity and hyperviscoelasticity cases), and the third one on the porosity (leading to the
weak viscoporosity case). Existence and uniqueness are proved for the three cases by using
the theory of linear semigroups. Generically, the energy decay is shown to be polynomial.
Nevertheless, there is a particular choice of the constitutive parameters in the hyperviscoelasticity
case that produces the exponential decay.

The structure of this paper is as follows. In the next section, we recall the evolution and
