They are obtained in this way as volatile oils, with a peculiar and strongly-marked
odour, and possessing distinctly basic properties.

We found no difficulty in procuring the bodies in question by this method in a state
of perfect purity, 80 as to examine their properties with accuracy.

From the outline which we intend to give, it will be obvious that this group of bodies
exhibits the most striking analogies with the ammonia-bases; 80 much s0, in fact, that
frequently it will only be necessary to repeat the observations, which were published

by one of us about eight years ago, regarding the methylated and ethylated derivatives
of ammoniaÂ®.

The experiments which we have to communicate refer chiefly to the methyl- and ethyl.
compounds; though here and there we have used amyl as material. Since we have pre-
ferred working in the ethyl-series, we begin with the description of the ethyl-compounds.
