The contractions were observed twenty-seven, forty-

ime, and seventy-two hours afterwards, and found to be as vigorous as those in experi-

nt «, or in the control experiment 1. They were seen only in the eggs of the surface
Ts, which alone had imbibed water freely. 100 hours after, and three days later still,

By resembled experiment a. The fact that water was not absorbed freely, except by the

13per layers of these eggs, deprived the experiment of a part of its value, as the propor-

in of actively contracting eggs to the water had no definite relation to the numbers

Sed, and could not be determined. Bxperiment e.—The experiment was repeated, using equal parts of unimpregnated

s and of water. At twenty-seven, fifty, and seventy-six hours after, the rhythmic

tractions of the yelk were as vivid as in experiment @ or in control experiment 1;

vFt the discus proligerus was less lobular, and not s0 often detached, 104 hours after,

i the eggs were opaque.
