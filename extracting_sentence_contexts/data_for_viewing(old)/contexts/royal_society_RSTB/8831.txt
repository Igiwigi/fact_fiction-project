always have q < 1, and so any combination of o and p above (3.2)

the red line in figure 3a implies kin competition is costly.

We cannot forget that survival parameters a and p are con-
strained by Ro > 1. If we superimpose figure 3a on figure 1, we
see that the cost interpretation of (1/4)(quv¢ — pv;) can only fail in
a narrow region of parameter space: that region above the solid
black line but below the red line in figure 3b,c. We contend,
therefore, that (1/4)(qv; — pv;) is most likely an indirect-fitness
cost. In fact, for sufficiently small t (i.e. for cases where floaters
occupy harsh, marginal habitat) we are virtually guaranteed
that (1/4)(qv¢ — pv;) counts it as a cost (figure 3b).

Returning now to our development of the indirect-fitness

When this expression is positive (respectively, negative),
delayed dispersal is favoured (respectively, disfavoured) by
selection. In model II, we again find that, for fixed values of
a and p, increasing ‘deviant’ survival parameters q and s
increases the advantage of helping (figure 4). By comparing
