ammonium vanadate was separated by filtration from a residue containing slica, phos-
phates, &c., and was crystallized by evaporation in platinum ; the pentoxide obitima≈ø
from this salt was free from phosphorus. Another mode, which was adopted in order

* to obtain perfectly pure vanadium pentoxide, was to prepare the pure oxychloride, and
this, on being decomposed by water, yielded the acid as a fine orange-coloured powder.
In order to free this powder from any trace of obstinately adhering silica, 1t was mois:
tened with sulphuric acid and exposed in a platinum vessel for 8ome days to hydrofluoric-
acid gas; after expelling the sulphuric acid and on fusion, a mass of large transparent
crystals of chemically pure yanadic acid was obtained.

The vanadium minerals appear invariably to contain more or less phosphorus, and
this fact in _itself serves to establish the close relationship which exists between these
two elements. The complete separation of this substance from vanadium is attended
with great difficulty: if much phosphorus is contained with the vanadium, the method
which has proved most effectual for its removal is to deflagrate the finely divided impure
acid with its own weight of sodium in a well-covered wrought-iron crucible, and wash
the resulting mixture of yanadium oxides by decantation until the wash-water ceases to
give an alkaline reaction; frequently this operation had to be repeated three times be-
fore the molybdenum test ceased to indicate phosphorus. In other preparations, in
which the phosphorus had been more completely remoyed by previous operations, the
process described above, of repeated crystallization of the ammonium salt, was found
capable of furnishing a product in which no trace of yellow precipitate was produced
by molybdenum.
