Live imaging of invaginating tissues has provided an during invagination. Unpublished computer modelling of epi-

imaging in Drosophila gastrulation revealed that, instead of cir-
cumferential fibres, an apical meshwork of diametrical fibres
actually plays the predominant role in constricting the apical

area [15] (although there is currently no equivalent evidence 4, Apical cable-driven buckling
