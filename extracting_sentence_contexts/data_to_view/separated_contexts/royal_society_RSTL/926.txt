The range of human hearing .comprised between the
lowest notes of the organ and the highest known cry of
insects, includes more than. nine octaves, the whole of which
are distinctly perceptible by most ears, although the vibra-
tions of a note at the higher extreme are six or seven hun-

dred fold more frequent than, those which constitute the
gravest audible sound. Since there is nothing in the constitution of the atmos-
phere to prevent the existence of vibrations incomparably
more frequent than any of which we are conscious, we may

* imagine that animals like the grylli, whose powers appear to
commence nearly where ours terminate, may have the fa-
culty of hearing till sharper sounds, which at present we do
not know to exist, and that there may be other insects hear-
ing nothing in common with us, but endued with a power of
exciting, and a sense that perceives vibrations of the same
nature indeed as those which constitute our ordinary sounds,
but 5so remote, that the animals who perceive them may be
8aid to possess another sense, agreeing with our own solely
in the medium by which it is excited, and possibly wholly
unaffected by those slower vibrations of which we are
sensible.

1 should be always most unwilling to occupy the time of
this Society with idle speculations on mere possible modes of
existence, and should not have called its attention to this
subject, had I not observed several curious facts which 1
thought might prove interesting, and may serve to justify
some latitude of conjecture beyond the strict evidence of our
8enses.
