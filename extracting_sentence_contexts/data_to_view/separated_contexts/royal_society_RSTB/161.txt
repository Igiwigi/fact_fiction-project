In the experiment to be next given the
after-effect was so large that after an interval of one minute it was perceptible with
the galvanometer 7} shunt. There should, therefore, be a very large effect if the
galvanometer circuit be closed for from -03”—05” after the excitation. As a matter
of fact, the effect is small under these conditions. Srrip of Tissue from Small Torpedo. Six Groyes in Circuit of Primary Coil,
