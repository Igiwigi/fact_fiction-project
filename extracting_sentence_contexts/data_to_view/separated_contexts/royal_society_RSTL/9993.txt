Ganoids, and which, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, mus still be
to be true for all Ganoids except Lepidostens, is a secondary arrangement. This
clusion follows from the fact that in Elasmobranchs, &ec., which are not descendan/
the Ganoids, the same arrangement of seminal ducts is found as in Lepidostens, and:
must therefore have been inherited from an ancestor common to the two groups. If, therefore, the current statements about the generative duets of Ganoids are
the males must have losb their vasa efferentia, and the function of vas deferens m
have been taken by the homologue of the oviduct, presumably present in the m
The Teleostei must, moreover, have sprung from Ganoidei in which the vasa efferentia
