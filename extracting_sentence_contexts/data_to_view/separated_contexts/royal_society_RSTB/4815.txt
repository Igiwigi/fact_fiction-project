On the passing of such a cataclysm
of the utmost possible severity and the restoration of conditions favourable to life, evolu-
tion will start again de novo, but from an initial number of Ny monotypic genera instead
of a single one. When, long ages after, the biological statistician examines the frequency
distribution for sizes of genus in the group evolved from the survivors of the cataclysm,
he will therefore find, as we have found, a number of primordial genera Ny in excess
of unity: and further he will have to remember that the time z will be measured,
not from the origin of the group, but from the passing of the cataclysm. In fact, of course, we must expect matters to be far more complex even than this. The action of a “cataclysm” of less than limiting severity might be represented, in
highly simplified terms, somewhat as follows. For any species the chance of survival
is p, of destruction g (p+q=1).
