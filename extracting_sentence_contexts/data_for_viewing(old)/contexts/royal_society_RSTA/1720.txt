for any t < 0. The latter is called the modified history function of z.

Now we will study equation with respect to this concept of modified delay. To this end, we
first need the following technical result.

Lemma 4.4. Let K be the Riemann—Stieljest integral defined in (4.7) and let C be its restriction to the
domain of Q. Then
D(G)cD(Ca) and (Ca)\p(q) = K.


Proof. For simplicity, we denote by
= e* U(-,0), aA€eC.
By using the fact that |j|([—a, 0]) > 0 as wa > 0 and using [39, Lem. 6.1], one can see that

lim Ke, =0. (4.11)

d>+00

Using (4.5) and the resolvent equation, for any x € X,A € p(Q) and yp sufficiently large, we obtain
CuR(u, Q)exx = — (Ke,.x — Ke,x) .

By letting 4 > oo and using (4.11), we obtain Im(e,) C D(Ca) end Cae, = Ke,,. Now let g € D(G).
Observe that y — ¢,9(0) € D(Q), then g — e,g(0) € D(C) and ¢ = (y — e,9(0)) + e,¢(0) € D(Ca).
Thus D(G) Cc D(Ca). On the other hand,
