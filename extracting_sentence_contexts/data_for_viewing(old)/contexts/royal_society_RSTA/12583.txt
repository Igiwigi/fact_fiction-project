compared when under corresponding pressures, or pressures which ara the same fae-
tion of their critical pressures, Comparisons at corresponding temperstures should
lead to like results. If the boiling-point were a truly corresponding temperature,
then the vapour pressure at the boiling-point should for all liquids be the same
fraction of the critical pressure.

But at the boiling-poiot the vapour pressures of different substances are the same,
and hence if the boiling-point be approximately a corresponding temperature, the
urivical pressures of substauces ought to be approximately the same. This conclusion,
however, is not supported by facts, and henes, having regard to the doctrine of corre-
epouding pressures, Gunpexne’s view, that the boiling-point may be regarded ns a
correspunding temperature, réceives no support from VAN bes WaAAts’ theory.

Hitherto the boiling-point has been mainly of value as 4 comparable temperatura
in dealing with properties which, like density or surface energy, vary bub slowly with
the temperature.
