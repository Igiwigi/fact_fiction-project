INTENSITY RELATIONS IN THE SPECTRUM OF HELIUM. 139

series of Hydrogen is brought about by the admixture of Neon. The importance of
the mutual effects of gases on the intensity distribution in their spectra is
considerably enhanced by the fact that, in celestial spectra, the radiation from a pure
gas is never in question, and if indeed the spectrum of any single element were mani-
fest, its presence would not disprove the presence of other elements which, though not
giving rise to perceptible radiations peculiar to themselves, might nevertheless exert
an influence on the distribution of intensity in lines due to other elements. A third and most significant condition which affects the relative intensities of
spectrum lines is the pressure of the gas from which they are produced. In Helium,
as is well known, this is peculiarly conspicuous; the colour of the discharge, for
example, being green at low pressures.
