Further particulars will be given later. It proved, however, that even with the best of the apertures produced in this manner
the jet was not quite free from alien vibrations. That is due partly to deviations
from the correct form of the aperture, but also to the fact that the cross-section of the
jet is not strictly similar to the form of the aperture. This last-mentioned incon-
venience would be got rid of by allowing the jet to flow out of a tube which had the
correct form of cross-section. This solution is, however, for several reasons incon-

S venient.
