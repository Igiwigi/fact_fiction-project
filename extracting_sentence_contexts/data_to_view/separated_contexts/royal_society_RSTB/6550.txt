The latter sulcus
is accompanied by accessory external calcarine sulci. The calcarine group of sulci
is folded horizontally. Many features go to establish the fact that this large oper-
cular sulcus is homologous with the “ Affenspalte ’’—the clear definition of the sulcus
calcarinus externus, the identification in its correct topographical relations of the
sulcus praelunatus (18), the upward extension of the operculum, almost covering
the fissura parieto-occipitalis, and finally, the submergence of the sulcus occipitalis
transversus under the operculum. The operculum belongs to the type frequently

seen in the brain of the Chimpanzee and is homologous with the sulcus described
by some writers as the fissura perpendicularis externa. I am unable to find any
reference to so extensive an operculum in the human brain.
