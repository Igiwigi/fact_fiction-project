where G is bounded when its arguments are.

Theorem 2.5 ([13]). Fix initial conditions x, xo, and let x be the solution of (2.11). Consider the case?
of « = —1. There exist positive constants e9 and K independent of ¢ such that the ‘energy’
H= h(x — v(x)? + WO).

This estimate shows that the particle spends a long time in the well of the effective potential W.
The above discussion leaves open the question of stability of (2.11) for all time. In fact, forn > 1
such stability is virtually certain to fail due to Arnold diffusion. For the case of n = 1 the proof of
stability for all time depends on the verification of the assumptions of the Kolmogorov—Arnold—
Moser theory. There is a considerable literature by now dealing with such questions, see [18] and
references therein. Using the methods developed there one can prove stability under some mild
additional assumptions on V.

3. Geometrical averaging

In this section, we develop more systematically the heuristic geometrical explanation of the
Stephenson-Kapitsa effect. We put this effect in a more general setting and state the rigorous
results. More specifically, we point out that the ponderomotive force (v2 ff in (2.4) in the case
of n=1 d.f. is precisely the averaged centrifugal force of a certain constraint.
