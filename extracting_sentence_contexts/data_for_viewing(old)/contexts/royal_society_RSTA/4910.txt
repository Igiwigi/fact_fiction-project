individual case studies, as for example described by Longcope & Tarr [20], also provide a means
of comparing theory and observation; in the mentioned example, observations of flux emergence
in an active region demonstrate quantitatively that energy dissipated by magnetic reconnection
matches radiated power.

3. Modelling coronal heating

The idea that the corona may be heated by the combined effect of very many small transient
heating events known as ‘nanoflares’ [21] has been seminal. It should here be noted that these
transient energy releases are often considered to involve dissipation by reconnection, as in large-
scale flares, but the nanoflare scenario may apply for any transient heating mechanism. Indeed
wave heating is also naturally transient; for example, due to the nonlinear coupling between
plasma heating and damping. In fact, all heating mechanisms so far proposed will give impulsive


heating to some extent [7], but one of the fundamental questions to be resolved is the ‘degree
of unsteadiness’ [18]. Comparison of predictions from modelling with recent observations from
missions such as SDO is beginning to shed light on this [8,18].

Current sheets with energy dissipation by magnetic reconnection may be created in many
different ways, including emergence of new flux [20]. Detailed models of the build-up of energy in
magnetic fields and the subsequent energy release include models of field braiding (as reviewed
by [22]) and relaxation following an ideal MHD instability in a twisted field [23]. The process
by which reconnection actually dissipates the energy requires further investigation—dissipation
need not take place mainly through Ohmic resistivity within current sheets, but rather in larger
