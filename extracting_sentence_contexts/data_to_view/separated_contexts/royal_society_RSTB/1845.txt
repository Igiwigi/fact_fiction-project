It is unfortunately impossible to be sure from what part of the entire thickness of
the enamel these transverse ground sections come; the most successful slides were
obtained by taking teeth of rather flattened form, such as those of Galeus, grinding
the outer surface only sufficiently to flatten a small area, and then completing the
grinding entirely from the inner side, until it was thin enough for observation. Hence,
these sections do not contain the very outside of the enamel, and it is possible that
they may come from a plane near to its inner side, in which case the oat-shaped
spaces may contain the extensions of dentine so frequently referred to. That this is probably a true explanation is indicated by the fact that where, by

accident, on the edge of a serrated tooth, small portions of the enamel happen to be
cut in a similar direction, the bands occur, and, between them, the fine tubes cut
transversely, but the larger oat-shaped spaces do not occur at all. As the base of the tooth is approached the layer of enamel becomes thinner and,
at the same time, its structure becomes simpler in most Selachian teeth ; the coarser
tubular inner portion almost or quite disappears, and the whole presents more nearly
the appearance of an ordinary enamel. The fine vertical stria which characterise the
outer portions however remain, as does the lamination, nearly parallel with its
surface; but in this situation the obliquity of this latter to the surface is more
@arked.

8 Such are the main histological features of these enamels, but varieties occur in
Gfferent genera which may be briefly noticed. '
Thus, in Carcharias, in the upper portions of the tooth, there is a coarse tube
System near to the dentine, but the tubes in the enamel appear to be both more
Igimerous and coarser than the tubes of the dentine; these latter (the body of the
‘goth consisting of a fine-tubed dentine) thin down, and in many instances break up
®to a brush of fine branches short of the enamel, some, however, running on into it.
