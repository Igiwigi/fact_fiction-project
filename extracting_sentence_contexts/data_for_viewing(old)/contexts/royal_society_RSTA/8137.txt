BERTRAND put into statistical form a variety of hypotheses, as for example the
hypothesis that a given group of stars with relatively small angular distances between
them as seen from the earth, form a “‘ system” or group in space. His method of
attack, which is that in common use, consisted essentially in calculating the probability,
P, that a certain character, x, of the observed facts would arise if the hypothesis tested
were true. If P were very small, this would generally be considered as an indication
that the hypothesis, H, was probably false, and vice versa. BERTRAND expressed the’
pessimistic view that no test of this kind could give reliable results.

Borst, however, in a later discussion, considered that the method described could be
applied with success provided that the character, x, of the observed facts were properly
chosen—were, in fact, a character which he terms “‘ en quelque sorte remarquable.”

We appear to find disagreement here, but are inclined to think that, as is so
often the case, the difference arises because the two writers are not really considering
precisely the same problem. In general terms the problem is this: Is it possible that
there are any efficient tests of hypotheses based upon the theory of probability, and if
so, what is their nature? Before trying to answer this question, we must attempt to
get closer to its exact meaning. In the first place, it is evident that the hypotheses
to be tested by means of the theory of probability must concern in some way the
probabilities of the different kinds of results of certain trials. That is to say, they must
be of a statistical nature, or as we shall say later on, they must be statistical hypotheses.

Now what is the precise meaning of the words “ an efficient test of a hypothesis ? ”’
