(17) The Development of the Isolated Primordia.

In eight of the 21 isolations of I,, the isolated piece of tissue gave rise to a leaf. The
isolated leaves varied greatly in size, as they did also when J, was isolated. When 1,
developed in isolation, it was always symmetrical, as was also I, when isolated. For
in seven of the experiments, I, developed with both stipules, and in one experiment
with no stipules. It never developed with one stipule only (see Table III). In the
other thirteen experiments, I, failed to develop, although in six of them, at least half of
its presumptive stipular areas was included in the isolated piece. The fact that I,
failed to arise in these six experiments is remarkable and suggests that it may not have
been determined at the time when it was isolated, and that determination may only
take place in tissues that are in direct organic continuity with the growing-point. But
clearly much more evidence is needed on the point.

Part 4.â€”ConcLUSIONS.

The results of the experiments show definitely that the positions in which primordia
arise do depend on the positions of the previous primordia, and in this respect they
support the second of the two groups of theories referred to in the introduction. They
show further that, as a general rule at least, the new primordia arise in the largest of
the gaps between the previous primordia, as was pointed out in section (5) of Part 2:
