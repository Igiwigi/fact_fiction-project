In both sides the alveoli of the first, third, fifth, and
seventh teeth are large and the teeth are only loosely implanted in them ; while the
second, fourth, and sixth teeth in the left side and the second and sixth in the right
side are held tightly, the bone coming closely round their roots, fig. 5B and C. The space of the missing fourth tooth in the right side is occupied by bone which
reaches downwards between the large alveoli of the third and fifth teeth in the
manner of the bone round the roots of the second and sixth teeth. The obvious
interpretation of this difference in the nature of the alveoli of the odd and even
numbered teeth is that those in the loose sockets are replacing-teeth that had
erupted only a short time before the animal died.* The fact that the seventh teeth
are implanted in a loose socket apparently means that they have been cut only a
short time, but since there is no evidence of seven teeth being present in a smaller
animal they are unlikely actually to have replaced teeth. The examination of the remaining available material provided very satisfactory
evidence in support of the foregoing interpretation. The main point of interest in
the two smallest specimens lies in there being evidence of replacement of the canines
and incisors.
