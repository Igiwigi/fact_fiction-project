Moreover, having sncceeded (not without some trouble) in rendering apparent the
effect of differences of temperature in causing gas to move through fine apertures,
I recurred to the original problem, and by suspending fibres of silk and spider lines to
act as vanes, I have now gsucceeded in directly verifying the conclusion that the
pressure of gas at which the force in the radiometer becomes apparent varies inversely
as the size of the vanes. With the fibre of ilk I obtained repulsion at pressnres of
half an atmosphere.

The arrangement of the paper.

8. My object is to describe the reasoning by which I was led to undertake the
experiments as well as the experiments themselves ; but as the theory will be better
understood after acquaintance with the facts, T have inverted the natural order and
given the experiments first. And in order that the reader may not be at a dis-
advantage in reading the accounts of the experiments, I include here a somewhat fuller
account of the results to be expected as deduced from the theory which is to follow.

The Laws established by the experiments.

9. Law I.â€”When gas exists at equal pressures on either side of a porous plate across
which the temperature varies, the gas will transpire through the plate from the colder
to the hotter side, with velocities depending on the absolute temperature and chemical
