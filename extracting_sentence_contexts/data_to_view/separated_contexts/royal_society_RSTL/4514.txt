The inclination is obviously highest in the winter months
and lowest in the summer months, passing through its mean value about the period
of the equinoxes. The horizontal force has a corresponding variation, but with
opposite 8igns. The occasional irregularities are more marked in the horizontal
force than in the inclination, and in both they prevail chiefly in the months of spring
and autumn, It must remain for a separate discussion, to deduce from the great mass
of facts which have now been collected at Toronto, the numerical conclusions which
they will afford in regard to the frequency and magnitude of the disturbances in the
different months of the year; but antecedently to the certain conclusions to be drawn
from such numerical values, it is not an improbable supposition, that the months of
spring and autumn (and notably those of autumn) may prove to be generally the
most disturbed months, and consequently those of the greatest depression of the
horizontal force resulting from the disturbances. The irregularities may be expected
to diminish as the series is extended ; but if they are, in part at least, occasioned by
actual irregularities in the force itself produced by the disturbances, they may bave
a character of permanency in certain months which no continuation of the series
would remove, if it should prove that the disturbances prevail more in some months
than in others, and if their action has on the average a special tendency. In commenting on the fortnightly means of the Bifilar observations at Toronto in
1842*, (in which year the Bifilar observations were suitable for the investigation,
inasmuch as the scale-reading returned nearly to the same division at the close, as
that at which it had stood at the commencement, of the year,) I called attention to
the remarkable feature, indicated by the Bifilar readings, of an excess in the value of
the horizontal force in the summer months over the other months of the year; and I

remarked on that occasion, that © the excess appeared to be too large to be caused by
any conceivable error in the determination of the temperature correction of the
magnet, or generally of the apparatus by which it was suspended.” The average
difference between the summer and winter months, derived from the observations of
the Bifilar in the single year referred to, was 00161 parts of the whole horizontal
force, or *0056 in absolute measure.
