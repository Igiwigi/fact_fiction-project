The figure may roughly be taken as a section of the atmosphere stretching from a
region of low (29°00 in.) to a region of high (30°50 in.) pressure, but with the
following qualifications. As in all such diagrams the vertical scale is out of all
proportion to the horizontal, but also the horizontal scale is not the same in different
parts. The horizontal distances. represent differences of pressure at sea-level, but
since the barometric gradient is never uniform, equal distances on the diagram do not
represent equal geographical distances. The gradient is always slight in anticyclonic
regions, and steepest in the intermediate regions, and hence the right-hand part
requires to be opened out. An attempt is made to correct this in fig. 2, where the
horizontal distances are meant to represent geographical distances. How to open out
the scale on the sides is a matter of judgment, but the amount of enlargement is
based on the fact that the mean temperature shown along any even kilometre height
should coincide with that giv@n in Tables IT. and III. The distance across may be
taken roughly as 1000 miles.

Fig. 1 obviously fails in this respect ; it is only meant as a representation of the
facts disclosed in the tables previously given. In both figures the full lines represent
the section of the isobaric surfaces by a vertical plane, and the dotted lines the
sections of the isothermal surfaces. Fhe broken lines show the departure of the
temperature + or — at any point from the mean value for that height. In drawing
the lines irregularities that seem to be due to an insufficient number of observations
have been ignored, and the lines are not carried to the ground because the distribution
there depends upon the season. If we take a temperature below the mean to indicate
that the air there has recently ascended and conversely, the following points appear
