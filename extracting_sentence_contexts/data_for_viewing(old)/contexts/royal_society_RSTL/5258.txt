surface, until at a certain elevation, varying on different days, the decrease is
arrested, and for a space of from 2000 to 3000 feet the temperature remains nearly
constant, or even increases by a small amount ; the regular diminution being after-
wards resumed and generally maintained, at a rate slightly less rapid than in the
lower part of the atmosphere, and commencing from a higher temperature than
would have existed but for the interruption noticed. This interruption in the
decrease of temperature is accompanied by a large and abrupt fall in the temperature
of the dew-point, or by actual condensation of vapour, from which it may be inferred
that the disturbance in the progression of temperature arises from a development
of heat in the neighbourhood of the plane of condensation. The subsequent falls in
the temperature of the dew-point are generally of an abrupt character, and corre-
sponding interruptions in the decreasing progression of temperature are sometimes
distinguishable, but in a less degree; as might indeed be expected from the fact, that
at lower temperatures the variations in the absolute amount of aqueous vapour are
necessarily smaller, and their thermic effects consequently diminished.
