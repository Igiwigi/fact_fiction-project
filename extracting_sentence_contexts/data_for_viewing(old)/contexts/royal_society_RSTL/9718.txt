Introduction.

Is our previous paper we examined the essential conditions for the existence 0
sensitiveness in vacuum discharges, and found that sensitive discharges are produced
by a rapid snccession of discharges of free electricity from one or both of the termin
of the tube, each individual discharge being 80 small in quantity as to be inst
taneous.* The effects which are produced by the approach of a conductor #0 a tubs:
containing a sensitive discharge were shown to be due to the fact that these individual
or component discharges are composed of free electricity, either of a positive or of .
negative kind, and that this free electricity during its passage through the tub
exercises its ordinary static induction through the space around ib; and bhis, oo
bined with the sudden and instantaneous character of the component discharge 1tse!
and the consequent suddenness with which the free electricity appears in any park 0
the tube, produces impulsive electric action on the sides of the tube and in the spac
outside it, leading to instantaneous rearrangement of the electricity within the
ductor and consequently to discharges from the side of the tube in its imme
neighbourhood, to which these effects are immediately due.

While snbsequent researches have confirmed us in our opinion as to the correctn« ©
of these conclusions, they have also brought home to us more fully the exact bea
