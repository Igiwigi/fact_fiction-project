3 The experiments with this apparatus make the superficial origin of the nuclei
8 very improbable; for, if they arose only where the rays fell on a surface, the fogs
would have been confined to the ends of the tube. ‘To account otherwise for
A the fact that whenever a fog was produced (with the light passing axially) it was
uniform from end to end of the tube, we would have to suppose that on account of
undetected scattering of the ultra-violet rays at the ends, the walls throughout the
whole length of the tube received approximately uniform ultra-violet illumination. Perhaps the most striking proof that the nuclei produced by ultra-violet light are
formed throughout the volume of the moist air, and not at the surface of the vessel
containing it, is furnished by experiments with very strong radiation. As already
stated in a preliminary note on the subject (‘Camb.
