approximately optimal permutations are returned. As our parameter space Â© of permutations
has a nonlinear structure, which may instead be represented by a graph, the question of how to
represent the set of results is of interest.

The case study was repeated independently 100 times (each initialized with a different seed for
random number generation). Figure 1 shows the set of most commonly returned permutations in
these 100 runs, together with their graph structure as permutations. Mathematically, they form a
cyclic graph which is generated by two (non-adjacent) transpositions, namely the transposition
(4,6) which exchanges 4 and 6, and the transposition (7,9).

These four permutations were returned in 82 out of 100 runs (seven returns of the top left,
19 of the bottom left, 27 of the top right and 29 of the bottom right). They have the same initial
three choices of customer, namely (3,2,1). In fact, the returned permutation started with (3, 2,1) in
98 out of 100 runs.

By the heuristics discussed in the running example, part 6, variations at the beginning of
the permutation are likely to have the greatest effect on the objective function, and hence on
the accept-reject step of the SA algorithm. The random walk should therefore provide a clear
indication of the optimal initial order in which customers should be approached, and this heuristic
is clearly borne out in figure 1. Conversely, we may expect ambiguity over the later stages of this
order. The same argument, however, indicates that this ambiguity should not be problematic
