Furthermore, the frequency of flares is insufficient and their
distribution too patchy to account for the heating of the entire corona. However,
solar flares do result in enormous amounts of energy released very rapidly. In
fact, they are some of the most spectacular events occurring on the Sun, but even
larger stellar flares have been observed. A number of superflares, bright enough to
be mistaken as gamma ray bursts and with increases in soft X-ray luminosity of
more than a factor of 100 compared with the normal value, have been observed,
e.g. on young rapidly rotating flare stars [29,30] and magnetars [31,32]. Flares are typically associated with a major global restructuring of the
magnetic field and they result in local heating of the corona and chromosphere,
but also the acceleration of huge numbers of particles producing hard X-ray and
gamma ray radiation.
