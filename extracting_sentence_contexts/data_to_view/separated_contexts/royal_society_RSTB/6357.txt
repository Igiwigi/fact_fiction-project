Oestrone stimulates both fibro-muscular and epithelial growth in the hydatids. The response of the fibro-muscular tissue can be regarded as part of a general sensi-
tivity to oestrogenic substances of mesodermal structures derived from the urogenital
ridge and genital cord. Such a view makes it possible to relate the fact that the fibro-
muscular tissue of apparently the entire genital tract is responsive to oestrone (ZUCKER-
MAN 1936c). Similarly, the proliferation of the epithelium of the hydatid can be
related to the growth which occurs under similar conditions in the uterus masculinus. This response was first demonstrated in monkeys (PARKES and ZUCKERMAN 1935;
Courrier and Gros 1935; VAN WAGENEN 1935), but,it has since been shown to occur in
the dog (pE Joncu and Kok 1935), and in the guinea-pig (VAN DER WOERD 1936;
Courrier and CouEN-SOLAL 1936).
