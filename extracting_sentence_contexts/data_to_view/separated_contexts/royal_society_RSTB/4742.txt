Frequently, for
reasons unknown to me, a striated border is found at the unattached poles of the cells
of the cicatricial epithelium. They are very polymorphic and, generally speaking, the
further they grow from the parental epithelium, the less like it do they become. Owing
to the fact that, quite apart from mitotic division, much of the growth of the cicatricial
epithelium is due to that curious sliding motion of cells which is so frequent an occurrence
in these cultures, the contour of a rapidly-growing cicatricial epithelium is irregular,
owing to differences in the number of cell-layers in it, and also to the very variable
shape of its constituent cells, as they slide over one another. This type of movement
en masse is very like that which occurs during regeneration of epithelia im vivo, as
shown by Ranvier (37), Grroup (18), and others. By the third or, at the most, by the fourth day the cicatricial epithelium is complete
and has invested all the naked surfaces of the culture.
