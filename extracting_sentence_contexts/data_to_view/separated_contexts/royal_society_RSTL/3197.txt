The figures in Plates VI. and VII. illustrating © &ages,” I have thought it
proper to draw on fixed scales, scrupulously copying nature in regard to size. If
however, these figures be referred to, the not uninteresting fact will be made evident,
that there is no fixed relation between the size of the entire ovum, and the degree
of development of its most essential parts. An extraordinary instance of this is
afforded in Plate VII. fig. 124.
