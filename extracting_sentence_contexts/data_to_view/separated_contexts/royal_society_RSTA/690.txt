It functions as a
tumour suppressor, mediates interactions between tumours and surrounding cells, plays a role
in host-pathogen defence, and, furthermore, increased abundance of it has been reported to be
correlated with cardiac amyloidosis [71]. The concomitant increased abundance of this protein
with increased abundance of transglutaminase has been found to be correlated with pancreatic
cancer progression, and both of those proteins were found in significant levels in this muscle
sample [72]. The fact that we find both of these proteins still present after all this time suggests that
they may have been present at higher than usual level of abundance in the original tissue sample. This again opens up avenues for further exploration, because it offers a tantalizing possibility that
Idi may have suffered from pancreatic cancer, or some other form of cancer.

(ii) Functions of the more abundant proteins

Given the age of the sample, it is not really possible within the constraints of the current study
to compare these results against those from freshly sampled muscle tissue to try and estimate
which proteins are expressed at higher levels, or lower levels, than would be expected. Because it
is not practicable to discuss all of the proteins involved individually, in the following section, we
present functional evidence for the more abundant proteins present in the sample.
