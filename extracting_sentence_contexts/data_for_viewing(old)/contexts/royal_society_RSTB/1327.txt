(b.) The Relation of Orbulina and Globigerina.

The features presented by Orbulina have been much discussed (of. Birscuu (6
pp. 68-70), and as they have been supposed to exemplify the phenomenon of dimor
phism, the subject claims our notice here.

Pourraes (28) first drew attention, in 1858, to the fact that a spirally arran
group of chambers, resembling the complete shell of a Globigerina, is often fo
within the spherical shell of Orbulina (ef. wood-cut, p. 409). This he considered to
the young of Orbulina, and he suggested that Globigerina and Orbulina might
alternate generations in the life-history of one species.

In 1868, Major OwEN (27) stated his opinion that the Orbulina shell “ may
regarded as a wild-growing closing-in chamber” of the Globigerina.

In 1883, Scuacko (29) deseribed specimens of Orbulina, both recent and fossi
He showed that the Orbulina shell is sometimes double; that the contained Globi-
gerina shell is most fully developed when the Orbulina shell is small, and that i
