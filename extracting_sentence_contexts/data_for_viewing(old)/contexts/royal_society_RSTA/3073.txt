What is quantum noise with regard to light in an interferometer? Keeping in mind the wave-
particle dualism, but choosing for now to describe light as an electromagnetic wave and looking
at the electric field, the output of a laser can be described by a sinusoid, given by the red-dashed
curve on figure 3a (the time series representation of the electromagnetic wave) [6]. Its amplitude
squared is proportional to the laser intensity, and its wavelength is inversely proportional to the
laser frequency and thereby related to the colour of the emitted laser light. Ideally, the waveform
would be a pure sinusoid, but due to quantum mechanics unavoidable quantum noise still
exists in the form of amplitude and phase noise on the light; this is shown in figure 3, grossly
exaggerated, by the blue graph overlaid on the red sinusoid. Amplitude noise corresponds to
power fluctuations, whereas phase noise (instantaneous frequency jitter) manifests in minuscule
(and not noticeable by the human eye) variations of the colour of the light. An equivalent way
of displaying this is as an arrow (so-called phasor) in the phase space picture on figure 3b. The
uncertainty in both amplitude and phase of the light is clearly visible here; in the fact, the tip of
the red arrow can be anywhere within the ball made up by the blue dots.

Now let us examine these uncertainties in more detail: in the phase space picture of a coherent
state—the light emitted by a well-stabilized laser—the coherent amplitude (related to the laser
power) is represented by the arrow, the uncertainty of the state is shown as a shaded ‘ball’. The
