i. Ina paper which I lately communicated to the Edin-
burgh Philosophical Journal, I endeavoured to show, that
caloric flies off from the surface of a heated body by the re-
pulsive energy existing between its own molecules, and con-
sequently, that their velocity increases with the temperature
of the body. This conclusion I deduced from the fact, dis-
covered by DELAROCGHE, that invisible caloric freely permeates
very thin plates of glass, in the same manner as light, but
that it is completely intercepted by thicker plates. If the tem-
perature of the body be raised, the atoms of caloric will be
brought nearer each other, their repulsive energy augmented,
their velocity increased, and consequently, they will now find
their way through a plate of glass which formerly inter-
cepted them. If the temperature of the body be raised still
higher, the molecules of caloric will acquire a velocity
sufficient to permeate the various humours of the eye,
and produce an impression on the retina, or in other words,
they will become light.
