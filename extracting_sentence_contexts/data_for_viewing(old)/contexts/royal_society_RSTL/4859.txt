arsenietted hydrogen exalts the chemical character of these compounds in a most
remarkable manner, the methylated and ethylated bodies exhibiting basic characters
scarcely inferior to those of ammonia itself. Tt remained therefore to be investigated
whether phosphorus, which, by its chemical tendencies, stands between nitrogen and

arsenic, would exhibit a similar deportment. It remained to be ascertained in what
manner the gradual entrance of binary molecules in the place of the hydrogen in phos
phoretted hydrogen would change the character of the original compound. The dis
covery of the tetrethylated ammonium-bases had also opened a new field of research, m
which the corresponding terms of the antimony- and arsenic-series were rapidly brought
to light. Tt was indeed possible to predict with certainty, that an appropriately elected
method would lead to the production of the analogous derivatives of phosphoretted
hydrogen. The time for resuming the study of the phosphorus-bases had in fact
arrived.

We have been engaged for a considerable time in the investigation of this subject,
and now beg to offer to the Royal Society in the following pages an account of our
experiments. .

In the first place, we have endeavoured to obtain the bases corresponding to phos
phoretted hydrogen, by a method analogous to that followed by M. PauL THENARD.

Recent experience suggested at once the replacement of the gaseous chloride of
methyl by the liquid iodide, which is s0 much more convenient for experiment;
and also the substitution, for the phosphide of calcium, of the compound of phosphorus
