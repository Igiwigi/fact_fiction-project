gave the fbllowing bands: 1st, A 667 to X 649; 2nd, X 615'5 to X 593; 8rd, X 543
to \ 532; and 4th, X 509 to A 4845.

(14) Another solution of the same kind, of the same colour, and with the same bands
in its pectrum, was united with that of (13) and saponified by Haxsgx's method, as
will be deseribed further on.

Other specimens were examined with the same result, and the presence of one
lipochrome or lutein band was found to be the rule, which fact alone goes far to «how
that the enterochlorophyll of Uraster rubens is not a vegetable chlorophyll, and the
saponification method tends to s8upport this view.

I formerly stated* that among worms I failed to find enterochlorophyll, and I have

recently examined the © bile” of Aphrodite aculeata with a negative result.
'N * Bile” of Aphrodite aculeata,t—1I tind that the stomach of Aphrodite contains in its

S afaintbandin red, yet on evaporating it to dryness and extracting with alcohol a colour-
SD les and bandless 8olution was obtained. Chloroform hardly took up anything from the
same residue, being only faintly yellow. Ether, and acetic ether, also failed to extract
