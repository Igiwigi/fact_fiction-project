physical explanation of the law of equivalents ;â€”assuming the one the other follows ; and
asuming the act of chemical union as DaLrox figured it, we see that it blends harmo-
niously with the perfectly independent conception of an ether, and enables us to reduce
the phenomena of radiation and absorption to the simplest mechanical principles.

Considerations similar to the above may, I think, be applied to the phenomena of
conduction. In the Philosophical Transactions for 1853, I have described an instru-
ment used in examining the transmission of heat through cubes of wood and other sub-
stances. When engaged with this instrument, I had also cubes of various crystals pre-
pared, and determined with it their powers of conduction. With one exception, I found
that the conductivity augmented with the diathermancy. The exception was furnished
by a cube of yery perfect rock-crystal, which conducted slightly better than my cube of
rock-salt. The latter, however, had a very high conductive power ; in fact rock-salt,
calcareous spar, glass, selenite, and alum, stood in my experiments, as regards conducti-
vity, exactly in their order of diathermancy in the experiments of MELLoxt. I have
already adduced considerations which show that the molecules of rock-salt glide with

facility through the ether, but the ease of motion which these molecules enjoy must
facilitate their mutual collision. Their motion, instead of being expended on the ether
which exists between them, and communicated by it to the external ether, is in great
part transferred directly from particle to particle, or in other words, is freely conducted.
When a molecule of alum, on the contrary, approaches a neighbour molecule, it pro-
