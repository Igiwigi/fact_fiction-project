Table IT shows that the mean value of the initial yield stress is greater in the longi-
tudinal direction than in the transverse direction, for each material. The lower yield
stress also, except in the case of steel A, is greater in the longitudinal direction and,
in the case of steel B, by approximately the same amount. Steel A appears in fact to
be more uniform in properties in the two directions that either B or C. The amount
