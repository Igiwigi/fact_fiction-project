Borxer,* following Fries and LEveiLLs, places
S Mrrdiola near the old group of Sphaerias, with especial reference to Zrysphe. I have
'S already quoted the view of Fries that the Meliolas may be considered tropical repre-
a sentatives of our Erysiphee, and BEKKELEY+ takes the same position. These opinions
appear to have been based simply on the resemblance in habit and the more obvious
anatomical characters, and on the fact that no Zrysiphe is known in the tropics. The detail of structure, and especially of the development of the fruit-bodies above
deseribed, enable us to criticise these views from a somewhat firmer standpoint. Apart from minor points of resemblance between Metiola and the typical Erysiphea,
81ch as the haustoria (not well developed in Meliola), the asci, &c., there can be no
question as to certain points of agreement in the structure and development of the
perithecia ; nevertheless, the origin of the fruit-body in the two groups is nob obviously
| Similar, and at first sight the differences may seem greater than they really are,
