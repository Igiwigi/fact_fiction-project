Specimen D was the twin egg of Specimen DD, with which it was practically
identical in size, measuring 9 millims. in diameter. In it the region of the primitive
knot was easily recognisable, being rendered abnormally obvious by the fact that an
extrusion of yolk had taken place at the knot from the interior of the vesicle. The
extruded yolk formed a small bulging beneath the vitelline membrane, and must
have oceurred during fixation. *

Here again, in this specimen, no further trace of embryonic differentiation was
discovered during careful examination of the portions of the opened egg viewed
in toto, in apposition with the shell, under moderate magnification.
