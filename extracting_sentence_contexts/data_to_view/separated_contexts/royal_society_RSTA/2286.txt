Hence, superposing these solutions, we shall obtain the same formule as for
the homogeneous case, but in which the “‘ apparent ” moduli are now, of course,
involved. We conclude, therefore, that the existence of the annual layers does not of itself
explain the discrepancies above noted. We may also observe that the relative values
of yyy and yy,» are also not explained by this fact. For if we take p,, equal to u,,,
we find from the formule (20.3) and (20.4) that py, is greater than u,, (compare § 16),
whereas we invariably find from experiment that wry» is /ess than pyr. § 21.
