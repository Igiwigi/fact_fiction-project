But it is also identical with Locy’s and Cas, Hint’s
ninth neural segment, and Neat’s ‘ Encephalomere v.”

The neuromere in front of that just identified, likewise possesses easily recognisable
features. It is distinguished by out-standing prominence and sharpness of definition,
and also by the absence, either complete or very nearly complete, of any proliferative
contribution to, or connection with, the neural crest. It lies, in fact, opposite the
hiatus in the neural crest which separates the acustico-facial from the trigeminal
Anlagen. This, our “first prefacial” neuromere, is thus, both relatively from its
position, and absolutely through its intrinsic characters, identifiable with the “ eighth
segment” of Locy and Cuas. Hin, and with “ Encephalomere iv” of Neau, It
appears in NEAt’s Table 2 as Segment No. 3 of the hind-brain.
