It is also invariant with : =
respect to the inversion x > |x|~?x provided that the pole of inversion does not belong to M. S
In particular, the Willmore energy equals 47 for every spherical surface. In fact, the Willmore 2
energy is the only conformal invariant up to a null Lagrangian. Blaschke and Thomsen also ty
derived the formula for the variation of the mean square curvature functional. These results a
were rediscovered by Willmore [23], who calculated the value of the Willmore energy for tori : S
and considered the variational problems related to this functional.
