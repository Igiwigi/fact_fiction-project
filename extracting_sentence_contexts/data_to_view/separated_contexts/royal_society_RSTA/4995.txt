In the first place it is usually assumed that n is
indefinitely great’ and ¢ indefinitely small, and then it is supposed that we may
neglect (p — q) cX’,.,, as compared with pq (n + 1), and so we deduce the normal
error curve whether p be equal to q or not. But I contend that this is unjustifiable
except for very small values of X’,,,. When the deviation X’ is considerable and
¢ vanishingly small, X’ will be an indefinitely great multiple of ¢ ; ¢ must be in fact
the unit in which X’ is measured and unless p = q, the ordinary normal curve is only
an approximation, even if n be large, near the maximum frequency. In the next
place, when we speak of 7 being large, are we quite clear as to what we mean in the case
of physical or biological frequency curves? We speak of a multiplicity of small
“causes” determining the actual dimensions of an organ, or the size of a physical
error, or the height of the barometer.
