erent organisms. Its essential conditions do not appear to differ from those- which
ZAvern all other known vital actions, and its normal excitors are the'same as those of
h3zher motor structures, but it seems to be less liable to be influenced by most poisons
ten are the vital properties of higher tisswes. It is not influenced in any manner by
the spermatozooids. From the contractile matter of striated muscle it differs in one
gportant particular, viz. that while the former is permeated by an alkaline fluid it is
bathed with an acid. No explanation of its rhythmic character has yet been found,
agd its uses in the economy are also unknown. In the ova of osseous fishes, and in those
oZ Batrachia, its existence has been ascertained, but usually its manifestations are slow and
nalistinct. That the rhythmic contractions have no essential relation to growth in the
oFum of os8eous fishes, is shown by the fact that they do not begin until the egg has
Zached its full 8ize. I venture to suggest that they may be connected in some way
vSth the conversion of a lower form of organic matter into a higher, such as occurs

tack, is connected with the rapidity of the changes which take place in the egg.
These eggs hatch in a shorter time than do those in which the contractions are slow

r8fer them to the same category as those motions which occur during the admixture of
certain fluids, as of spirit and water.

The fissile contractility is also independent of the action of a male element, although
