As we shall want to apply the function both to the case of the earth and to that of
the moon, it will be necessary to measure longitudes' from a fixed point in the ecliptic;
also we must distinguish between the longitude of the equinox and the angle y, as they
enter in the two capacities (viz. : in the X'Y* and FY functions) ; thus the N and N'
of previous developments must become N—ys, N'—y/ ; &, E must become e—þ, e—i/;
and 2(x—x') must be introduced in the arguments of the trigonometrical terms in the
semi-diurnal terms, and x—y' in the diurnal ones. The disturbing function must be developed s0 that ib may be applicable to the cases
either where Diana, the tide-raiser, is or is not identical with the moon ; but as we are
only going to consider secular inequalities, all those terms which depend on the
longitudes of Diana or the moon may be dropped. Tn the previous development of Part IT. we had terms whose arguments involved
e—e'; in the present case this ought to be written (Nt+e—p)—(N't+e—V), for
which it is, in fact, only an abbreviation. Now a term involving this expression can only give rise to secular inequalities, in the
case where Diana is identical with the moon ; and as we shall never want to differentiate
the disturbing function with regard to N', we may in the present development drop
the Nt and NT. Having made these preliminary explanations, we shall be able to use previous results
for the development of the disturbing function.
