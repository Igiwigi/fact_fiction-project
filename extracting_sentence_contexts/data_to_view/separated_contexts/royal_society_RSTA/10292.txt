It

EB possible that the same impurity could be present in each of these specimens to the

= Tt is well known, however, that when an electric discharge is passed through
£& oxygen, a considerable quantity of ozone is produced. It is in fact by this method
E that ozone in its purest form can be obtained. It is highly probable, then, that
© after the first discharge had passed between the electrodes, in the experiments on
%B oxygen, a considerable percentage of ozone was present in the gas, and it may be that
$ the discrepancy noted above is due to this cause. The experimental value of
& 455 volts found for oxygen seems to bear out this conclusion, for, ascribing the
A value of 161 volts to the atom of oxygen, we get by addition 483 volts as the caleu-
lated value of the minimum spark potential for ozone.
