Outside the inner layer is an external layer of muscles, chiefly composed of bu
of longitudinal fibres, but between them are smaller bundles disposed in a cire
direction. Outside the longitudinal layer of muscles is a thin layer, represented by a d
line in fig. 12, which is only superficially different from the external layer of mu
by reason of the fact that it does not stain so deeply. It is composed of scattered fibres of longitudinal and circular muscles, with a
connective tissue cells, the whole embedded in a gelatinous material, and coy
outside with a layer of flattened epithelium. I have called this layer the sheath.
