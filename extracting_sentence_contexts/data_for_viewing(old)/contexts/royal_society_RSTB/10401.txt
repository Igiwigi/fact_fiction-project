Figure 2. The expression of meaning goes through a linguistic cycle, switch-
ing between four modes: an inferential mode, in which meaning needs to be
inferred; a lexical mode, where meanings are expressed with words; a syn-
tactic mode, where they are expressed with several words organized in
hierarchical structures; and a morphological mode, where phrases are com-
pacted into single words with affixes and word form variations expressing
grammatical features.

— Mode 1. Inferred. Human communication is inferential [26].
Speaker and listener try to come to a shared understand-
ing of a situation, but not all meaning involved is
explicitly expressed. In fact, most of it has to be inferred
from the context, common sense knowledge and back-
ground information. For example, the sentence ‘I want
to come’ does not explicitly express that the action of
coming may take place in the future, but we can infer
this, because the speaker expresses a desire to carry out
the action, which implies that if it happens, it will be in
the future.

— Mode 2. Lexical. A meaning fragment becomes associated
with a word, and as soon as speakers and listeners
master an initial inventory of word—meaning pairs, the
words can be put together in multiword utterances with-
