multiplied or compounded together, &c.: the law of the addition. of matrices is pre-
cisely similar to that for the addition of ordinary algebraical quantities; as regards their
multiplication (or composition), there is the peculiarity that matrices are not in general
convertible; it is nevertheless possible to form the powers (positive or negative,
integral or fractional) of a matrix, and thence to arrive at the notion of a rational and
integral function, or generally of any algebraical function, of a matrix. I obtain the
remarkable theorem that any matrix whatever satisfies an algebraical equation of its
own order, the coefficient of the highest power being unity, and those of the other
powers functions of the terms of the matrix, the last coefficient being in fact the deter-
minant ; the rule for the formation of this equation may be stated in the following con-
densed form, which will be intelligible after a perusal of the memoir, viz. the determi-
