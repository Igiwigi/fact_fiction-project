REYNOLDS ON CERTAIN DIMENSIONAL

8ilk, and at once accounts for the observed fact that the positive motion with the
spider line was not obtained until the pressures were somewhat lower than those
necessary for the fibre of silk.

52. Both with the fibre of silk and the spider line the phenomena of imnpulsion (the
excess of pressure against warm surfaces) were apparent and consistent at densities
many hundred times greater than the highest densities ab which like results are
obtained with vanes several hundred times broader than the fibre of silk ; this verifies
the theoretical conclusion on which this part of the investigation was based. The
results in this case are not 80 definite as is the agreement of the logarithmic homologues
in the instances of transpiration ; but the one fact supports the other, and we may
consider the law of impulsion—Law VIIL., Art. 9--to have been sufficiently proved. This concludes the experimental investigation. PART 1L.—(THEORETICAT).
