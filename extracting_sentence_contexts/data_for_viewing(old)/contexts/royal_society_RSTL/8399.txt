96. To the solvent power of these and to their violent carrying and denuding action and
prodigious powers of breaking up the rocky mass of the primordial crust, by comparatively
sudden heating, by the continued conduction from below (in antagonism with the sudden
cooling locally), by precipitation of comparatively cold water from above, must be ascribed
powers of comminution and alternate denudation and depoxition such as later geologic
time, much less historic time, presents us with nothing but the faintest resemblance of.
And to this early machinery may be ascribed the production, as by a mighty mill,

* Daxa (American Journ. Sci. 1847) has, however, shown a different possible cause for the greater prevalent
stecpness of mountain-ranges on one of their flanks, viz. the greater intensity of the tangential pressure at the
less steep flank, or smaller resistance of the materials of the opposite one. This, however, gives no solution
of the very general fact of western flanks being the steepest.â€”March 1873. f :

of the vast mass of comminuted material which has formed the assumed azoic and yet
more or less stratified rocks, or of others of like character that may have preceded them.

57. At length the crust became further indurated, and with its viscous bed beneath
greatly thickened and convection cut off by it, as well as its coefficient of contraction
diminished, arrived at that state in which it was thick enough to transmit tangential
stresses within its own sheet. When the balance of contraction in a given time between
the crust and nucleus beneath was such (the latter still in great part liquid, contracting
