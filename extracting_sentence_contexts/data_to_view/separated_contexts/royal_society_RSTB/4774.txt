But is it capable of ingesting foreign bodies (e.g., dust particles) in vivo ? The presence, in cultures of adult lung, of both carmine particles—which had been
added to the culture—-and of minute carbon granules within cells obviously derived
from the alveolar epithelium suggests, at any rate, the possibility of phagocytosis
im vivo by these cells. And this view is strengthened by the fact that free carbon
granules could not be found in the control specimens of lung. But one fact stands
out: the alveolay epithelial cells in vitro are capable of swelling up and of detachment,
and, under the conditions of these experiments, were found to be actively phagocytic tor both
coal and carmine particles. The phenomenon often occurs on such a large scale that
it is difficult to suggest any other interpretation.
