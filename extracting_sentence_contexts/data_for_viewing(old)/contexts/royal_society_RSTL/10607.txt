Among the latter, those which become the more prominevt are referable to families
noteworthy for the large numerical proportion in which either their specific or their
individual representatives occur in temperate climates, under natural conditions ; that
is in the absence of stimulated luxuriance and consequent intensified struggle. Thus,
of the widely distributed families, we have nine species of Composite, three of Um-
bellifere, four of Rosacee, four of Ranunculdcen, and three of Labiate ; whilsb some
of the smaller families, which have fewer species, are remarkable for the large quantity
yielded by their individual representatives, as Polygonacee and Juncacee.

Natural rotation —Having now considered the climatal conditions of the four
separation-years, the characteristics of the chief species found on the various plots, and
in detail the number, percentages, and actual weights, of the species occurring on the
unmanured plots, we are in a position to appreciate the facts in reference to what
has been called natural alternation or rotation, as a result of the struggle uninfluenced
by the artificial conditions induced by manuring. ;

The conditions of success are s0 variable, even for the same plant at different stages
of growth, and in different, seasons, that we can scarcely predicate with any certainty
whether any individual species will gain or lose in the conflict ; although we may,
perhaps, form a fair conclusion as to the prevalence of certain groups of gpecies : as, for
instance, the poorer grasses—one or other of them according to the wetness or dryness
of the seagon or series of seagons, and also according to the decline of the freer-
