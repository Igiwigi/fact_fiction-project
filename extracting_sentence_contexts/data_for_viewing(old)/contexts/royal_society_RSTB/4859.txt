The system of orthogonal functions of the chief practical importance are those which
arise in the elimination of progressive changes by means of a polynomial function of the
time. These are the same functions as are used in analysing the sequence of weather
in each particular season ; it is worth noting that the above theorem is true of any
orthogonal system. .

In an unchanging series of independent values, i.e., one in which the frequency of
occurrence of any value is independent of the time, all the quantities 2’, except z,', will
be distributed in symmetrical curves about the mean value zero. If the values of x
are normally distributed about the mean m, with standard deviation co, then all the
values of x will be normally distributed with standard deviation oc, z,/, about a mean
m/ n, and the remainder about zero. This follows at once from the fact that the distri-
bution of the points representing the sample will be a globular normal cluster, and conse-
quently the distribution of their projections on a line drawn in any direction will be
invariable. Even when the values of x are not normally distributed, those of 2’ will
in general be much more nearly so, owing to the properties of compound distributions
which have often been discussed.

The simplest type of changing series is one in which the several values are distributed
independently and in similar distributions, but about a changing mean. It is with a
view to eliminating slow changes in the mean, that most methods of obtaining residuals
from smoothed values are employed. It is usually the case that slow changes in the
mean value may be sufficiently represented by a polynomial whose degree is small
compared to the number of observations in the series. In such cases the first few values
