For since

en cos* eo, — g?/4 = 1 + Pe sin® ny

it follows that , cos «, is always numerically greater than $9. In the case of the solution which tends to zero when r tends to infinity, the vorticity

will decrease according to some (non-integral) power of r. We note that the loci € =0
turn out to be a series of equiangular spirals

nO + pe, sina, log r = sw -+-const. (s = integer),

giving a periodicity in log r for a given value of 0,

The complete solution for Zp will be obtained by adding such solutions, corresponding
erp a a -P P-1

Z, will give the vorticity in the case « = 0, that is, for an infinitely slow stream or an
infinitely high viscosity. ‘The successive terms Z,, Z,, etc., obtained from (23.51), etc.,
will, of course, modify this solution, but it seems possible that a certain periodicity in
log r may persist. ‘This appears suggestive in view of the known fact that a sequence of
more or less discrete vortices are known to be formed behind such a cylinder, although
the motion in the actual case is, of course, not steady. In any case it is suggested that the functions defined by the differential equation
(23.2) should be examined and studied by the pure mathematician, and that this differ-
ential equation might eventually replace OSEEN’s equation as the basis of an approximate
treatment of the problem of motion of a stream of viscous fluid, slightly disturbed by a
cylindrical obstacle.
