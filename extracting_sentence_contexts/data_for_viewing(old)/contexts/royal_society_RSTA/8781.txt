more remarkable than in the corresponding Helium series. Moreover, 4388 is
enhanced relatively to 14922. The remarks which we made earlier regarding \4472
in the nebular spectrum apply with greater force to \4388, The behaviour of these
two lines in nebulz is thus correlated, in the light of these experiments, by the fact
that nebule are in a state of extremely low pressureâ€”and certainly much lower than
in the present investigation, so that the relative enhancement of \4471 and \4388
may be expected to be much greater. But the degree to which the phenomenon
occurs, even with the present exhaustion of the tube, is sufficiently convincing.

As in the case of the Diffuse series of Helium, this effect again cannot be described
as a continuous transfer of energy down the series, for if this were the case, \4144
would become visible when enhanced to a greater degree than \4388. It is actually
invisible, and calculation shows that this fact implies that its intensity relatively to
\6678 is not more than doubled. We must therefore repeat the former conclusion
that the strong enhancements of particular lines at low pressure are peculiar to these
lines, and in fact to the three lines \\4471, 4922, 4388, of the two Diffuse series.
Under still lower pressure, 14922 may be expected to become quite subordinated to
44388, which is already as strong in our experiments, and in the very low conditions
of pressure in nebule, \\4471, 4388, should therefore be the two most prominent
Helium lines of the Diffuse series. This is a well-known fact of observation in
astrophysics.

We may now take up the consideration of the effect of a trace of Hydrogen.
Inspection of the table is almost sufficient to show that the energy-transfer to longer
