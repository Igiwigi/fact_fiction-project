posed ; but lately, since it has become coated with carbonate
of lime and magnesia, weeds have adhered to these coatings,
and insects collected on them ; but on the sheets of copper, de-
fended by quantities of cast iron and zinc, bearing a proportion
below +; the electrical power of the copper being less nega-
tive, more neutralised, and nearly in equilibrio with that of
the menstruum, no such effect of deposition of alkaline matter
or adherence of weeds has taken place, and the surface,
though it has undergone a slight degree of solution, has re-
mained perfectly clean : a circumstance of great importance,
as it points out the /imits of protection ; and makes the appli-
cation of a very small quantity of the oxidable metal, more
advantageous in fact than that of a larger one.

The wear of cast iron is not 80 rapid ; but that a mass of
two or three inches in thickness will last for some years, At
least the consumption in experiments which have been going
on for nearly four months, does not indicate a higher ratio.
This must however depend on the relation of its mass to that
of the copper, and upon other circumstances not yet ascer-
tained (such as temperature, the relative saltness of the sea,



on the preservation of the copper sheathing of ships, &c. 245
