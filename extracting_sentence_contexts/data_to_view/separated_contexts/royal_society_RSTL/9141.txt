According to this view, liquid and solid bodies give generally continuous spectra,
not because they are liquid or solid, but because in these states the molecules have a
more complicated structure than in the gaseous state. Experiment has to deeide
between the two theories : the theory of molecular disturbance, and the theory of mole-
cular structure. I think that the facts are decidedly in favour of the latter theory. Mr. Lockvyer's investigations have shown that most bodies give us a continuous spec-
trum, as a gas, before they condense, and many at a considerable temperature above
the boiling point.
