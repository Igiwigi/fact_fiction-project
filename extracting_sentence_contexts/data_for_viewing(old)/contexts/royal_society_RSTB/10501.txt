panel. Our percepts are constrained by what we expect to see and the
hypotheses that can be called upon to explain sensory input [27]. Arcim-
boldo, ‘a 16th century Milanese artist who was a favourite of the
Viennese, illustrates this dramatically by using fruits and vegetables to
create faces in his paintings. When viewed right side up, the paintings are
teadily recognisable faces’ [28, p. 204]. Adapted from Friston [26].
(b) Faces are probably one of the most important (hidden) causes of our sen-
sations. While in Arcimboldo’s image, viewing right side up is needed for the
configuration of features to appear as a face, when images are already recog-
nizable faces, viewing right side up (by rotating the page) reveals that these
faces might in fact be more different than they appear (this is the so-called
‘Thatcher illusion’). These examples illustrate the complex interplay between
prior expectations and stimulus features that shape perceptual content

minimized (at the level of the spinal cord); however, with a good
generative model, these movements will also fulfil visual and
other exteroceptive (e.g. somatosensory) predictions. This fol-
lows because descending (multimodal) predictions emanate
from a deep generative model that effectively assimilates predic-
tion errors from all modalities—including interoception. In this
context, an important and sometimes overlooked aspect of
active inference is that it implies a counterfactual or conditional
