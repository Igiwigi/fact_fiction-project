Concluding remarks

We have proposed a similarity solution for reaction front propagation in fracture—matrix systems. Although we developed our solution by considering a bimolecular reaction between a reacting
species and a mineral, the exact form of the reaction kinetics does not influence the behaviour,
and the analytical solutions ((3.1a,b), with (3.4); or (3.8a-c)) are expected to be valid for a broad


class of transport problems involving fracture—matrix interactions. In fact, our similarity approach
reproduces the simplified forms of the Laplace-transform solutions [1-3,19] for non-reactive
solute transport or heat transport, when diffusion/dispersion in the fracture are neglected. This may be readily verified by setting zs—> oo in (3.4) or (3.8b,c). Our similarity solution
also reproduces the behaviour of the reaction front observed in numerical simulations of a
multi-component reactive transport problem with mineral interactions [4].
