Such events are very rare and intermittent, because of the long-term Lagrangian : =
correlations of turbulent velocity gradients. During these events, the stresses experienced by the : Ed
particles can be strong enough to lead to their break-up. In fact, turbulent flows are known to :z
generate very large velocity gradients, and those, in turn, may initiate a fragmentation process. : >
Our aim here is to provide such statistics on the mechanisms of fibre break-up in a turbulent flow : 8
with dilute fibre suspensions, and specifically to characterize the statistics of the extrema of both Los
the tension and the curvature. Those statistics obtained with fine-scale simulations of individual :<
fibres are used as the basic ingredients, in order to develop accurate macroscopic models, relevant : =
for the above-mentioned natural and industrial applications. Such models predict the time ia
evolution of the fibre size distribution.
