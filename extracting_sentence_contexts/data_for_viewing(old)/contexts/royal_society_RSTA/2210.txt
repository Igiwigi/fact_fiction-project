even means. More concretely, it is clear from (1.1) that for plumbed manifolds one has t +> —t
M+ —M, which flips the sign of the adjacency matrix and hence flips the signature of the lattice
for which the theta function 0° M should be defined, and as a result does not render a function
on H when one tries to literally apply definition 1.1.

This is when the question starts to become interesting from the perspective of mock modular
forms. To be concrete, we let M3 be a weakly negative three-star plumbed three-manifold. As
mentioned before, for such cases Za (M3; T) are basically false theta functions, which are known to
furnish (rather simple) examples of the so-called quantum modular forms, as will be explained
in §2. The quantum modular properties of the quantum invariants Z, are essentially what
makes their relation (1.4) to Zcs possible. At the same time, it can be shown that a mock theta
function and the corresponding false theta function lead to a pair of quantum modular forms
that are in fact basically equivalent (cf. lemma 2.6), in a way that precisely leads to the radial
limit relation (1.6). This leads to the natural guess that the quantum invariants Z.(—M3; t) for
the orientation-reversed three-star plumbed manifold are given by mock theta functions. This
conjecture, proposed in [10], will be discussed in conjecture 2.7.

In §3, we will review some recent results supporting the conjecture. The first involves building
the relevant orientation-reversed three-manifold via Dehn surgeries on knot complements [12],
and the second involves employing the indefinite theta series to extend the definition of Z,(M3)
to general plumbed manifolds [11]. To illustrate the various ideas discussed in this proceeding,
we will discuss in details the specific example of the Brieskorn sphere M3 = X(2,3,7).
