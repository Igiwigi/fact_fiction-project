If the bandwidth
is fixed and the transmitted power is increased, then the capacity C(P, W) tends to infinity, but
it grows only logarithmically with power. On the other hand, if the power is fixed and the
bandwidth increases, the capacity will never exceed C(P) = limw- 0 C(P, W) = P log, e/No bit/s. These two cases highlight the fact that when bandwidth is available, it is a good idea to spread
the power over the whole bandwidth rather than only using a small part of it. We will now use the band-limited AWGN channel in (4.1) as the noisy channel in figure 1b to
exemplify two fundamental principles regarding achievable rates of continuous- and discrete-
time channel models. First, there exist multiple discrete-time channels that correspond to the
same waveform channel, depending on the choices for the inner transmitter and receiver.
