will show that the expression m(7,+72) takes the radion of

be 3 the un-ionised molecule as 7,+7, For if « be the ionisation,

this would give us for the separate ions the products amr,

and emr,, and for the un-ionised molecule the product (l—a)m(r,+7:). The sum of

the three products is simply m(r;+7.). This seems to explain why the linear relation,

which might be expected to obtain between m(7+72) and 7 for dilute solutions, does
in fact approximately persist up to normal solutions.

(b) References to Previous Theories.—The results obtained in the last section
suggest considerations which may tend to a great simplification of our ideas in
reference to the internal friction of fluids. Hitherto, very diverse theories have been
advanced in order to account for the apparent anomalies in the viscosity of liquids,
and various general formule have been proposed in order to express the experimental

285, 1887) to express the viscosity of a solution in terms of the concentration. For
