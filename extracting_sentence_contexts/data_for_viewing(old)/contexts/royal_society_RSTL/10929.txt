15. We have frequently to deal with things , y, 2, &e., pairs, &c., of those things,
the differences between which depend on the existence or non-existence of certain
circumstances, or upon taking into account; or ignoring certain cireumstances. Thus
we may apparently have collections of units 7, y, 2, &c., which are at one time f, when

one state of things exists, of one form, and ab another time t” of another form. This
is, however, not 80; the form of a collection is absolutely invariable. The apparent
alteration of form arises from overlooking the fact that the units dealt with are not
z, y, 2, &c., but (& at time tf), (y ab time ?), &c., ( at time t'), (y at; time t'), &c. The
unit (@ at time ?) may be quite different from (« at time 7”). Where there is only one
alternative t, the collection (z at time ?), (4 at time 7), (2 at time ft), &c., is of the same
form as the collection z, y, 2, &c., and it matters not which is the collection dealt with.

16. Aggregations of those things which, in a symbolical representation of the units
considered in any case, are already represented as units, must not be supposed to be
sufficiently represented without additional symbols, but must each be represented by
a distinet symbolical unit. An aggregation of things is, as far as the processes of
reasoning are concerned, a mere unit, and must be 80 dealt with,

17. While it is important that a unit should be represented and dealt with as a
