186 R. N. SALAMAN ON THE POTATO VIRUS “X”:

varieties of potato all failed because the “A” virus obtained no entry by inoculation
although carborundum was used. A series of mixtures on tobacco plants was more
successful. In this plant A+ X produces a reaction similar in character to that in-
duced by Y+X but of much less intensity. Such at least is true of the combinations
A+G, and A+ X*4; the combinations A+ X° and A+ X* are not to be distinguished
from uncomplicated infections of X° and X% respectively, fig. 44, Plate 25.

Mixtures of common aucuba and masked tobacco mosaic strains virus and those of the X virus

These reactions (fig. 39, Plate 24) which have been studied in close co-operation
with my colleague Dr Dennis, have brought to light new facts of importance. In-
fection with any of these mixtures on tobacco is heralded by the formation of local
lesions which do not occur as a result of simple infections with either X”, X°, X’ or any
of the three tobacco mosaics when operating alone. They appear in five days when
X% or X* are present with either of the three tobacco virus strains, and in 11-15 days
when any of the remaining X strains take their place. The lesions are fully necrotic and
in the case of either X¥, X°, X or X* are similar both in number and in the de-
struction of leaf surface involved. When °, and to a still greater extent when X” is the
partner, the local lesions are so rapidly formed, so deeply necrotic and extensive, that
they cause the inoculated leaves to wither and drop.

The systemic lesions also fall into two groups: those occurring when X”, X°, X? and
X* are partners, and those when X*% or X% take their place. In the first group the
