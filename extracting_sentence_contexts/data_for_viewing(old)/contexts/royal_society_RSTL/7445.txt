MOVEMENTS OF RESPIRATION ON THE CIRCULATION OF THE BLOOD. 583

tween the thoracic moyements and those of the heart do not depend on mechanical
ditions peculiar to the mode of experiment; and they furnish additional proof that,
t is not affected by the abnormal psychical conditions of the animal, which in this in-
ce was throughout under the influence of morphia. Tt may therefore be assumed
t in the dog, 80 long as the respiratory passage is sufficiently open to allow of the
trance of air into the chest, the act of inspiration is invariably followed in normal
breathing by increase of tension and shortening of the diastolic interval, 7. e. acceleration
of the heart's action*. It remains to be considered by what instrumentality this influence
is exercised. The facts indicate that the result consists in an alteration of the mode of
contraction of the heart. That part therefore of the nervous system which presides over
tFe movements of that organ must be concerned in its production. But the effect may
I brought about either by agencies which are entirely mechanical, 4. e. altered relations
between the pressures existing in different parts of the circulation, or may be also more
le due to changes in the chemical state of the circulating fluid. For this reason
te proper course seems to be, first to determine to what extent the increased activity
& the heart which follows each inspiration may be accounted for as a mechanical effect
o&the expansion of the chest. Then, even if it be found that the whole of the obseryed
pEenomena may be thus explained, it will still be open to question how far the chemical
&n8equences of each respiration may be also concerned in their production.
=The effect of the respiratory moyements on the arterial pressure stands in relation to
the fact, demonstrated by DoxbRs, that all the organs contained in the chest are kept
