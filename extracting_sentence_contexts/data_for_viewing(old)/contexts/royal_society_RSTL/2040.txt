of the Sleeve.”

'The 7* tide line on the Ower shoal is further back than the same line on the
$hore; which, being contrary to the course of single tides, appears to indicate 5
there a tide of interference ; the absence of tide on the coast of Jutland is also k
probably the result of interference, for the tides at Heligoland are said to rise |
9 feet (Nozs). If we suppose the southern and northern tides to reach this
space at an interyal of 6 hours, —for instance, if the tide-hours for these tides |
be respectiyely 3) and 9,—the tide will be altogether obliterated by their com-

bination.

We may therefore account for seyeral of the facts, by supposing the 9 tide-
line to advance from the north in a convex form, 80 as to approach this part ;
and the southern tide to move 80 as to produce the lines 12", 1, 2b, 3b on the
coast of Denmark, if it were single. We may thus suppose in the middle of the
ocean @ space which has its tide at 6" nearly, by the interference of the tides
at 4b 5h 6b 7b 8b from the north,
and 3) 7b 6Þ 5h 4b from the south.

A cireumstance in the rise of the tide in this part appears to confirm the opi-
nion that it is a tide of interference. © A singular peculiarity in the tide about
the Ower was observed ;—there was no sensiþle 74ise in the tide until 3 hours
after low water; and when the ebb stream was nearly done, a sudden rise of
5 or 6 feet took place; 80 that nearly the whole rise of the tide occurs in the
