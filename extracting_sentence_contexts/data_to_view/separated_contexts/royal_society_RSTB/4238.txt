In
general, the minimum numbers were selected as the point of start. This procedure
certainly tends to reduce the amplitudes, but in a case selected at random in which a
60-term analysis was tested against one of 20 terms the difference found was only
2 per cent. As the method has been applied uniformly it probably does not conceal
any significant fact ; 20 terms certainly give better results than 12 and the use of the
former number does not seriously increase the labour of computation. Though the
arithmetical calculation of the amplitudes, with a few exceptions, has only been
carried out for the totals of the 75 years, yet the first additions for each period were
made in four groups each including the statistics of from 18 to 19 years. The results
of these separate additions were graphed on squared paper.
