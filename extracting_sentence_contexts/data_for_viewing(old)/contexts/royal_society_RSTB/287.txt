of M. Renavxr to distinguish it specifically, I shall designate the former plant
Rachiopteris Gray, in memory of my lamented friend, Asa Gray.t

Returning to my figures of the petioles of Rachiopteris duplex,} it will be observed
that the two secondary bundles a, w, given off in alternate pairs from the opposite
sides a’, a’ of the primary petiolar bundle a, obviously supply the two secondary
petioles y, y, giving off, in their turn, smaller bundles to a third series of branches or
pinnules. Fig. 6 of Plate 2 of the present memoir represents a transverse section
of a petiole of Rachiopteris Lacattii,§ for which I am indebted to Mr. Lomax, of

* See memoir, Part VI., Plate 57, figs. 45, a'' and fig. 47, m, m.

+ A further ground for abandoning M. Renavur’s duplicated generic names is found in the fact that
twice in his memoir (Joc. cit., pp. 165 and 177) he considers that Zygopteris is distinguished from
Anachoropteris by having six of the radial prolongations of the medulla, whilst Anachoropteris has only five.
My plant just described, which certainly should belong to M. Runauut’s genus Zygopteris, has but five.

§ In the memoir referred to on page 157, Professor Srenzen expresses an opinion that the petiole
which in previous memoirs, as in the present one, I have identified with Renauwt’s Zygopteris Lacattit
is really the Z, elliptica of the French author. This, however, is a mistake easily explained. In its
middle cortex, M. Renauuy’s Z. Lacattii contains numerous gum-canals, which are not found in his
