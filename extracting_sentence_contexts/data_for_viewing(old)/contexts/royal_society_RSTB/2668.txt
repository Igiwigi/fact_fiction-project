Heliastrea (ef. figs. 24, 26), or in Montlivaltia, shows that it fundamentally agrees

with them in structure. It will be readily understood that the broadening out of a
“ridge” is correlative with compactness of a septum, whereas its narrowing to the
nodulose “Cyclolites” form leads to a porous condition of the septum between its
ridges.

Microscopic Sections.
The fundamental facts of the fibrous structure are the same as in Astraidee. The

fibres are laid down in fine growth-lamella. The cut edges of growth-lamelle are
well seen in fig. 39, a finely-polished surface slab of part of a Fungia septum, under
