At the same time, the notches already referred to give rise to similar rays,
which also divide (fig. 12, c). These branches soon meet and, in course of time, a disc
similar to that shown in fig. 12, e, results.

6. The Dise of an Ordinary Tube-foot.—Mention has already been made of the fact that
a pair of tube-feet is present in each ambulacral area in the imago of 2. miliaris. In
the terminal portion of each tube-foot three separate rudiments are laid down. The

giving off branches which elaborate until, in the late pluteus, the condition shown in
fig. 13, e, is reached.
