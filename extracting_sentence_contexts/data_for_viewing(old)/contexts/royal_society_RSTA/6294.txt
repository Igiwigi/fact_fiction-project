In 1940, Mooney’s [1] starting point was based on three basic assumptions: (i) the material is :
isotropic, (ii) the deformation is isochoric and (iii) the traction in simple shear in any isotropic —
plane is proportional to the amount of shear. Working in terms of the principal stretches, he 23
derived the following strain energy density, Dm

Wt, bay bg) = CiQ2 +23 +43 — 3) + Colaz? +452 +452 —3), a2) 3S
where C; and C2 are two constants. Clearly (1.3) may be recast in the form : 8
W(I1, 12) = Ci — 3) + Co(I2 — 3), (1.3) : Ss

where Ip = tea — tr C*]/2 is the second principal strain invariant. It is worth noting that Mooney ae
never mentioned the term ‘invariants’.

In fact, it was Rivlin who used the principal invariants in a systematic and consistent way, with
a series of papers published in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society beginning in 1948,
see [4] for an historical overview of these works. The strain energy density function (1.4) is now
referred to as the Mooney-Rivlin model. Starting with Rivlin, the use of the full methodological
apparatus of linear algebra became fundamental to the development of the modern theory
of nonlinear continuum mechanics, as is attested, for example, by the ubiquitous role of the
Hamilton-Cayley theorem in constitutive modelling.

In 1944, Treloar performed a series of experiments on rubber [5], which to this day are still
used as a benchmark set of data. Comparing the predictions of (1.2) with his data, he noted on
page 99 of his book [3],

The conclusion to be drawn from the experimental observations [. .. ] is that the formulae of
