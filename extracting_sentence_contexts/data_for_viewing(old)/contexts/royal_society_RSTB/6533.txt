stage their wall grows medially for a short distance but the cavities do not extend into
them. Hrymons (1895, a2) mentions a similar median process in Forficula. Accord-
ing to this author and to Wiesmann (1926), the coelomic cavities of the first maxillary
segment in several Orthoptera and in Carausius respectively first appear as an
unpaired median cavity which afterwards becomes paired. This does not obtain
in Locusta. In the 75-hours stage, the first maxillary mesoderm is seen to be con-
nected with the mandibular mesoderm by means of a lateral strip. It is interesting
to note that the first maxillary coelom never extends beyond the hollow of its
appendage. Its walls eventually form the muscles of the first maxillae, as is already
seen in the 112-hours stage. It does not show a division into three parts as obtains in
the other coelomic cavities. In fact, it does not even develop a dorsal pouch. It
therefore corresponds largely to the ventral portion of the other coelomic cavities.

Labial Coelomic Cavities (fig. 101, Plate 6)—The second maxillary or labial coelomic
cavities first appear in the 56-hours stage when they lie in the hollow of their
appendages. They grow very rapidly. Already in the 70-hours stage they show
a long dorso-rostral and a short dorso-anal pouch. The former extends to the
proximal ectoderm of the latter ; it is, however, not connected with the mesoderm
of the first maxillary segment. ‘The ventral pouch fills the hollow of the second
maxillary appendage and forms the labial musculature ; this process is already
evident in the 94-hours stage. The dorso-rostral and anal portions contribute to
the formation of the splanchnic mesoderm, the lateral myoblast plate, and the fat-
body in a manner similar to that obtaining in the thorax. The second maxillary
