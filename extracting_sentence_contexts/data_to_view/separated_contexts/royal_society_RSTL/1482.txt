In some late experiments
on the action of potassium on sulphur and phosphorus, and on sulphuretted hydrogene,
and on phosphuretted hydrogene, I find that the phznomena differ very much ac-
cording to the circumstances of the experiment, and in some instances, I have obtained
a larger volume of gas from potassium after it had been exposed to the action of cer-
tain of these bodies, than it would have given alone, These experiments are $till in
progress, and I $hall soon Jay an account of them before the Society, The idea of the
existence of oxygene in sulphur and phosphorus, is however $till supported by various
analogies, Their being nonconductors of electricity is one argument in-fayour of this,
Potas:ium and sodium I find when heated in hydrogene, mixed with a small quantity
of atmospheric air, absorb both oxygene and hydrogene, and become nonconducting
inflammable bodies analogous to resinous and oily $ubstances,

suspicion of their being metallic. The salifiable bases might
be considered either as protoxides, deutoxides, or tritoxides :
and the general relations of salifiable matter, to acid matter,
might be supposed capable of being ascertained by their rela-
tions to oxygene, or by the peculiar state of their electrical
energy. The whole tenour of the antiphlogistic doctrines, necessarily
points to such an order; but in considering the facts under
other points of view, solutions may be found, which if nor 80
simple, account for the phanomena, with at least equal facility. If hydrogene, according to an hypothesis to which I have
often referred, be considered as the principle which gives
inflammability, and as the cause of metallization, then our list
of simple substances will include 9xygene, hydrogene, and
unknown bases only ; metals and inflammable solids will be
compounds of these bases, with hydrogene ; the earths, the
fixed alkalies, metallic oxides, and the common acids, will be
compounds of the same bases, with water,

The strongest arguments in favour of this notion, in addition
to those I have before stated, which at present occur to me,
are, First. The properties which seem to be inherent in certain
bodies, and which are either developed or concealed, accord-
ing to the nature of their combinations.
