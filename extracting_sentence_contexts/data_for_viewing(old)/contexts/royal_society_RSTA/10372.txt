ITS EFFECT ON TEMPERATURE AND ITS PRESSURE ON SMALL BODIES. 541

The force on A due to B is mal? R’/Ud?, where R’ = aN’.

These are not equal unless R= PR’, @e., unless the two bodies have the same
temperature, an illustration of the fact that equality of action and reaction does not
hold between the radiating and receiving bodies alone. They no longer constitute
the whole of the momentum system. The ether, or whatever we term the light-
bearing medium, is material, and takes its part in the momentum relations of the
system,

If the surfaces are partially or totally reflecting, the forces are easily obtained.
Thus if one is totally reflecting, it can be shown that the force is only half as great as
when it is fully absorbing. But it will be sufficient to confine ourselves to the case of
complete absorption, followed by radiation of the absorbed heat equally in all directions
from all parts of the surface. More general assumptions do not alter the order of the
forces found.
