The Margate—Ashford is, as we
;Z8hall see hereafter, our most active circuit; it would show values still higher were the
Sconnecting wire in a direct line. E I regretted to find that the returns which reached me of the telegraph disturbances
Zof August—September 1859 were unusually meagre. The fact appears to have been
hat the disturbance was of snch magnitude and of 80 long continuance, and this at the
Sbusy season when the telegraph is more than usually required, that our clerks were at
their wit's end to clear off the telegrams (which accumulated in their hands) by other
Joxs affected but less direct routes. At a time when observations would have been very
Shighly acceptable, they were too much occupied with their ordinary duties to make
Fnotes of the deflection of the needles and the changes. And I may here advert to the
Zircumstances with which we are 8urrounded, and the conditions under which our
Fobservations are made.
