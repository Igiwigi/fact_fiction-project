But, on the other hand, it had been brought out
through accumulated observational results that the winds of middle latitudes while
blowing towards the east, which so far is in agreement with Hapixy’s theory, do, in
opposition to what would be expected under that theory, blow more towards the Pole
than from the Pole. Thus the facts and theory seemed to be at variance. It then
occurred to me that facts and theory could be reconciled by supposing that the great
circulation brought into probability under HapuEy’s theory does actually occur, but
oceurs subject to this modification, that a thin stratum of air on the surface of the
Earth in the latitudes higher than about 30°—a stratum in which the inhabitants of
those latitudes have their existence, and of which the movements constitute the
observed winds of those latitudes—being by friction and impulses on the surface of

* Reference having been made in the text here to my paper read at the British Association Meeting
for 1857, on the “ Grand Currents of Atmospheric Circulation,” and to the Abstract of it printed in the
volume of the Association for that year, I have to mention as a correction that the theory here described
and correctly designated as Hapiuy’s Theory, was in the printed Abstract erroneously named as
Hauuey’s Theory. I was led into that mistake as to authorship of the commonly accepted explanation
of the trade winds, through my finding it designated as “‘ Hau.ey’s theory of the trade winds ” by Maury,
in his ‘‘ Physical Geography of the Sea,” to whose newly proposed views in that book my attention
was at the time specially applied. GRAND CURRENTS OF ATMOSPHERIC CIRCULATION. 675

the Earth retarded with reference to the rapid whirl or vortex motion from west to
east of the great mass of air above it, tends to flow towards the Pole, and actually
does so flow under the indrawing influence of the partial void in the central parts of
that vortex, due to the centrifugal force of its revolution.
