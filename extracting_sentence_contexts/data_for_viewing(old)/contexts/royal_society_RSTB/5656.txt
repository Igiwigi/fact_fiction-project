The Production of Kojic Acid from Different Sources of Carbon.

The mode of formation of kojic acid from carbohydrates by fungi is of considerable
biochemical interest because of the fact that the y-pyrone nucleus is a common con-
stituent of so many groups of naturally occurring chemical compounds. With a view
to obtaining some information on this point, a series of tests, detailed below, was
carried out on the production of kojic acid from different sources of carbon.

A CzapeKx-Dox medium (Medium A) was made up of the same salt composition as
that described on p. 7. To separate lots of this medium 5 per cent. of one of the
following compounds was then added in place of the usual 5 per cent. glucose : levulose,
sucrose, galactose, lactose, xylose, arabinose, glycerol, mannitol, starch. The
different batches were tubed out in quantities of 10 ¢.c., sterilized, and 6 tubes of each
batch sown with each of the six species mentioned on p. 129 as giving a positive test for
kojic acid when grown on a medium containing glucose. The strain of Aspergillus
flavus, catalogue number Ac. 16, which gave a negative test for kojic acid on glucose,
