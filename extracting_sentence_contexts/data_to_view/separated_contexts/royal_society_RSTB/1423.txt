This mechanism must be localised in the nerve end-plates. Should
these end plates become hyper-esthetic from any cause, the ordinary inhibition of
co-ordination will be suspended, stimuli will be summated, and the muscle thrown
into varying degrees of tetanus or contracture. In fact, contracture might be
considered an epilepsy of the end plates. The action of aldoxime upon curarised muscle is in favour of this view. Curarised Muscle.â€”Curare greatly modifies the action of aldoxime.
