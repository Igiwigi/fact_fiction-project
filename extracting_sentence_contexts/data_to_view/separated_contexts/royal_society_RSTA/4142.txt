This condition can be satisfied with (b’ |a’) real, with (b’ |a’) = (a’ |b’),

but this would involve (b’| being interchangeable with |b’), which is in conflict with the difference : 2
in the physical interpretation of the two. Instead, taking (b’|a’) and (a’ |b’) to be complex and : =
taking (b’ | a’) = (a’|b’)* avoids any such conflict (see below). In fact, the matrix formed by the :8

With the algebra of measurement symbols established, a measurement-based statistical : Ss
interpretation of the quantum formalism is possible, in particular, by considering a triple product ih
of measurements formed from the symbols of two incompatible properties, namely, : g

naturally expects the result of an intervening measurement to produce a fraction of the ensemble
introduced at the beginning of this composition of measurements. The expectation value of property A for systems in the state b’ is the average of the possible
values of A, weighted by the probabilities of occurrence that are characteristic of the state b’; one
can write the probability formula as

pla’, b’) = tr M(a’ M0’). (3.13)

The additivity of p(a’,b’) and the fact that )°,, p(a’, b’) = 1, which follows from this, shows p(a’, b’)
to be stochastic, establishing the core of its interpretation as the probability that a’ is observed
in the measurement of A of a system just previously measured to be in state b’, with first
selective measurement of B playing the role of state preparation.
