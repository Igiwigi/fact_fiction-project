Remark 2.3. A particular consequence of the previous remark that will be used throughout the
proof of proposition 2.1 is that
(u- VT,T)=0 fora. t,

if u and T are as in the proposition. This follows from a smooth approximation argument and the
fact that T(., f) â‚¬ Hj(D) a.e. in t. Indeed, if T(-, t) is smooth and compactly supported in D then

by the divergence theorem. The bilinear form T+> (u- VT,T) is continuous on H}(D), per (2.2).
