glasses containing more than 4 wt% H2O only Tg, peak could be identified and the glass transition
on Tg onset was overlain by the broad artificial peak below 120°C. The difference between the
Tg onset and Tg, peak is on average 14+2K (independent of the initial amount of water). We
could therefore estimate the extrapolated Tg onset (our proxy for Tg, fictive) for all samples, by
applying the temperature correction (thermal lag) determined by the melting points of pure
metals (subtracting of 4.5 K) and then further subtracting these 14K. Temperature corrected data
are listed in table 2.

(a) Carbonate glass transition temperature—bulk H70 relationship

Figure 4 displays the limiting fictive temperature of the carbonate-water solution as a function
of the carbonate weight fraction content. The glass transition temperature of pure water is
taken from literature [35,36]. The data show that increasing water content decreases the glass
transition temperature of the amorphous mixture. Such a plasticizing effect can be described
by the one-parametric Gordon—Taylor (GT) equation [40], which was derived for the case of
athermal mixtures without specific molecular interaction between the different components.
In some cases, this equation can be generalized and can be used also for strong molecular
interactions [41]:
