stances in'more distant countries. Some of the impressions or
remains of plants found in soils of this nature, which were, by
more ancient and less enlightened oryctologists, supposed to
belong to plants actually growing in temperate and cold cli-
mates, seem, on accurate investigation, to have been parts of
exotic vegetables. In fact, whether we suppose them to have
grown near the spot where they are found, or to have been
carried thither from different parts, by the force of an impelling
flood, it is equally difficult to conceive, how organized beings,
which, in order to live, require such a vast difference in tem-
perature and in seasons, could live on the same spot, or how
their remains could (from climates s0 widely distant) be brought
together to the same place, by one common dislocating cause. To this ancient order of fossil vegetables belong whatever
retains a vegetable shape, found in or near coal mines, and
(to judge from the places where they have been found) the
greater part of the agatized woods. But, from the species and
present state of the trees which are the subject of this Me-
moir, and from the situation and nature of the soil in which
they are found, it seems very clear that they do not belong to
this primeval order of vegetable ruins.
