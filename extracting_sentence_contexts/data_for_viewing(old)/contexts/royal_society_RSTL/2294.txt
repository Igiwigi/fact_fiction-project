1001. I have had a small battery of ten pairs of plates thus constructed, and am
convinced that arrangements of this kind will be very important, especially in the
development and illustration of the philosophical principles of the instrument. The
metals I have used are amalgamated zine and platina, connected together by being
soldered to platina wires, the whole apparatus having the form of the couronne
des tasses. The liquid used was dilute sulphuric acid of sp. gr. 1'25. No action
took place upon the metals except when the electrodes were in communication, and
then the action upon the zine was only in proportion to the decomposition in the
experimental cell ; for when the current was retarded there, it was retarded also in
the battery, and no waste of the powers of the metal was incurred.

1002. In consequence of this circumstance, the acid in the cells remained active
for a very much longer time than usual. In fact, time did not tend to lower it in
any sensible degree; for whilst the metal was preserved to be acted upon at the
proper moment, the acid also was preserved almost at its first strength. Hence a
constancy of action far beyond what can be obtained with the use of common zinc.

1003. Another excellent consequence was the renewal, during the interval of rest,
between two experiments of the firxst and most efficient state. When an amalgamated
zinc and a platina plate, immersed in dilute sulphuric acid, are first connected, the
current is yery powerful, but instantly sinks very much in force, and in some cases
actually falls to only an eighth or a tenth of that first produced (1036.), This is due
to the acid which is in contact with the zinc becoming neutralized by the oxide
formed; the continued quick oxidation of the metal being thus prevented. With
ordinary zinc, the evolution of gas at its surface tends to mingle all the liquid toge-
