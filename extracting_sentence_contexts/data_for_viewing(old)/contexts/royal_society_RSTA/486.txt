In this study, the influence of the testing direction was focused on and all three testing directions,
as introduced in figure 3, were tested with J-Integral measurements using a multiple specimen
test procedure and additional COD measurements. For the latter measurements, specimens were
deformed beyond crack initiation and then cut in the mid plane, ground, polished and the
resulting crack profiles were digitized and arranged to measure COD; at the former crack tip.

The typical microstructure observed parallel to the RD is shown in figure 6a and consists of
elongated grains with an alignment almost parallel to the SD with a grain size of about 300 nm.
The ultimate strength can be found in table 2 and more details to the following results can be
found in the corresponding paper [28].

The COD results are presented in figure 6b with the crack profiles and in table 2. The interesting
fact is that for Orientation B the crack exhibits a crack deflection perpendicular to the desired
crack propagation direction and COD; in this orientation shows a much higher value as for the
other directions. It should be noted that due to the deflection and the connected shearing of the
crack flanks, the reconstruction to the point of the first large visible crack advance and not of
the coalescence with the first void was accessible. The new crack propagation direction is very
