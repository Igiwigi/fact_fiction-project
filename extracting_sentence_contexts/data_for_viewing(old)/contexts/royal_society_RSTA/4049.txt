cross sections in hadron colliders. And precise measurements of jets are used to constrain those
parton densities further.

5. The electroweak scale

The transition to the next important energy scale in physics is nicely illustrated by staying
with deep inelastic scattering. Electron-proton collisions can not only be mediated by photon
exchange, but also by the exchange of weak bosons, the W and the Z. As the W carries electric
charge, those events will have distinct final states, in which the emerging scattered lepton has
turned into a neutrino. As might be expected, the rates of these ‘charged-current’ events are
much lower than those of the electromagnetic scatters, reflecting the relative strength of the
electromagentic and weak forces. However, as the energy scale increases, the rates converge, until
at around 10! ev, they become roughly equal. This effect, measured at HERA [20], reflects the fact


that most of the apparent difference in strength of the two forces at lower energies is due to the
different propagator masses (zero for the photon, 101! eV for the W and Z). Once the energy is
such that these masses are no longer important, a symmetry is restored, and the forces become
comparable in strength. This energy scale is known as the electroweak symmetry breaking scale.

(a) The Z and the neutrinos

Studies of the Z boson, resonantly produced in e*e~ collisions at the Large Electron-Positron
Collider (LEP) and Stanford Linear Collider [21], provide the precise information on many
features of electroweak physics. One major triumph was the precise measurement of the decay
