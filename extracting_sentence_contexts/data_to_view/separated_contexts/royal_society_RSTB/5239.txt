ARBACTA, ECHINARACHNIUS AND LEPTASTERIAS. 301

In Arbacia the amount of resorption of calcite at the actual peristomial margin is
small in spite of the fact that the auricule are incomplete arches. This is in keeping
with the fact that each area bears but a single spheridium which remains in a pit near
the peristome throughout the life of the urchin (¢f. Echinus miliaris where each ambula-
crum bears numerous spheridia three of which pass, during development, from the
ambulacrum on to the buccal membrane.—Gorpon, 1926, a). The adoral triads, at
first narrow and high, become relatively broader and lower ; much of the calcite together
with the primary tubercle gradually disappears until, in the adult, only a small part of
each plate—that around the pore-pair—remains.
