for th <t < ty 41. Here V7 (tet7 tk+2) indicates the value of committing C; at ty,1 followed by the
optimal commitments for t > th.

In order to optimally manage the operation of the wind farm, at time f=, we lock in the
commitment at f,,; by maximizing over all possible future commitment decisions j for each of
the current possible commitments i (for which we are yet to make a decision). Mathematically, we
can write the optimization as

Vi (te; thy) = maxlVii(tki thyi)] Vi. (4.8)

Now as we step back in time across the instant from just after ty to just before t,, we must take
account of the fact that C, i,j refers to the current and future commitments and that the current one
will become the future commitment for the previous period. So, if we write f, to denote the value
the instant before the decision is made, and tt to denote the instant just after, we obtain the final
condition when solving in the period t â‚¬ [t,_1, f]:

Vit=t it) = max[ V(t; teya)]- (4.9)

To value the contract in between agreement times ty < f < t,41, with or without a delay before
its commencement, we can use the Feynman-Kac formula (according to It6 calculus, see [13] for
more details) to derive a PDE for Vj;. It follows simply that we must solve the following PDE for
all possible controls C;,;:
