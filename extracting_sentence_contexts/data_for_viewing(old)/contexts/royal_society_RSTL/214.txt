the liquor becomes red, but still' gives'a blackish-green precipi-
tate ; but, if it is boiled with nitric acid, it/then is converted/into
a red liquor, which yields a red precipitate, by-all the alkalis and
earths capable of causinga precipitation. - From these /observa-
tions, upon the" different combinations -of iron--with oxygen,
and of oxide of / iron with muriatic acid; ome conclusions. may
be drawn, interesting to mineralogy-as- well as to. chymistry.
The variety of colour in many 'stones in which iron has
been found, is a fact which, although we cannot deny our'as- "YH
sent to direct experiments, has never been accounted-for-in.a F
satisfactory manner. - In white, green, yellow, black; red, ina ;
word, in fossils.of every colour, iron, with sometimes the help,of
manganese, and lately of chromium, has. beenregardedJas.the
colouring matter of every shade;-- but it seems-almost para-
doxical, that the same- s8ubstance should assume-and communi-
cate 80 many tints. In mica, kaolin, amianthus, asbestos; rock
crystal, and: all white stones, I believe it to exist as the white
oxide ; and- that \$tate is its -first degree of combination with
oxygen. In them, this metal is not very abundant; for, if it were,
I have some reason- (as shall be proved immediately). to think,
that they would obey the loadstone strongly. | In lapis,ollaris,
