refer.* It must here suffice to lay down the fact that only two species of fresh-
water eels could be shown to exist in the Atlantic area: a western, Anguilla rostrata,
which is met with in the West Indies and northward of there in America, and an
eastern, Anguilla vulgaris, which is distributed throughout Western Europe, the
Mediterranean countries, and the islands of the Atlantic from Iceland to the
Canaries. The eels found in the Azores are also Anguilla vulgaris, whereas the eels of
Bermuda belong to Anguilla rostrata. In externals, the two species are hardly
distinguishable one from another, but certain numerical characters afford a means.
The number of vertebree in particular is a valuable character, Anguilla vulgaris
having on an average about seven and a half more vertebre than the American eel
(ca. 114°7 against ca. 107°2—ef. fig. 1). If we take the trouble of counting the
vertebra, it will be only a very few specimens per thousand which cannot be referred
with certainty to the one or the other of the two species. This fact has proved
of great importance in the investigations at sea, since it was found that the
larvee of the European and of the American eel are mingled together in certain
areas of the ocean.
