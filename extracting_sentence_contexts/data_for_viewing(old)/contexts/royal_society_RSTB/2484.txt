The excess of phosphoric acid in the surface soil in this case is much more than
the calculated excess per acre—being in fact a good deal more than the total
phosphoric acid supposed to be contained in the dung used. It is noteworthy,

however, that the lower depths of this plot are markedly poorer in total phosphoric
acid than those of Plot 3—so that the excess nearly disappears if we calculate for
18 inches, and becomes a deficiency if we include the third 9 inches; but as no
earlier samples have been examined there is no evidence to show whether the
variation in the subsoils is (as is'clear in many other cases) a mere accident.

The quantity of citric-acid-soluble phosphoric acid in this case appears to account
