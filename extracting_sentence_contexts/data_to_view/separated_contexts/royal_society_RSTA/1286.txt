The common deadband D is indicated by the dashed central

Thus the battery response is given by
B= Le[5i](B'G@)) — BP) + (1 — Le [5D (B86) — BP). (25)

Here, the indicator function 1¢[5;] determines whether the local frequency at bus i lies in the
range € = E€! UV €2, where €! = (—00, —F”] U [F", 00) and €? = (—F", —F"] U [F", F”) (figure 2). The
terms (B!(5;) — B?) and (B8(3) — B), where the functions B!(4;)) and B8(3)) are defined below, take
account of the fact that the BESS will in general be responding at a pre-contingency level B? just
prior to time 0. These terms therefore model the change in power output when the BESS delivers
its reference response. Since we do not explicitly model the state of the system prior to time 0, the
values of B? are randomly sampled initial conditions, see §3 for more details.

(i) Battery energy storage systems response to local frequency 6;

According to (2.5), if the local frequency 6; lies in the range € then the BESS response is determined
by this local frequency deviation.
