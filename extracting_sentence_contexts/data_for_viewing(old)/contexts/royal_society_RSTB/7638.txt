It is well known (e.g. Jeans 1927, chapter 8) that any function on the surface of the sphere,
or at least any that is likely to arise in a physical problem, can be ‘expanded in spherical
surface harmonics’. This means that it can be expressed in the form

3{ S AmPm(cosé) ete

n=0Lm=—n
The expression in the square bracket is described as a ‘surface harmonic of degree n’. Its
nearest analogue in the ring theory is a Fourier component. The essential property ofa
spherical harmonic of degree n is that when the operator V? is applied to it the effect is the
same as multiplication by —n(n-+1)/p?. In view of this fact it is evident that a solution of
