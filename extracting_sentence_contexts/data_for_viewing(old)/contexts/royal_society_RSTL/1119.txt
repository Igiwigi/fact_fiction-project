On account of an accident we cannot give the proportions
contained in'2 to 10; but the contents of the first and last
gasometers' confirm the former experiment, and shews that
the proportion of azote continues to diminish, as the experi-
ment proceeds, and also that there is a larger proportion of
carbonic acid given off when oxygen is employed, instead of
atmospheric air.

In this recital of experiments, which have occupied a con-
siderable portion of time, and attention, we have endeavoured
to give a plain statement of facts, from which every one may
draw conclusions for himself ; we shall here, however, take
the liberty of briefly recapitulating the principal of those facts,
and submitting what seems to us the most obvious inferences.

1. It appears that the quantity of carbonic acid gas emitted
is exactly equal, bulk for bulk, to the oxygen consumed, and
therefore there is no reason to conjecture that any water is
formed by a union of oxygen and hydrogen in the lungs.

2. Atmospheric air once entering the lungs, returns charged
with from 8 to 8.5 per cent. carbonic acid gas, and when the
contacts are repeated almost as frequently as possible, only 10
per cent. is emitted.
