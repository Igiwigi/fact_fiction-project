Perhaps the most serious problem is
that the gene trees upon which the current versions of the
chlamydial theory are based do not say what the proponents of
the chlamydial theory claim. This is shown in new analyses
both by Deschamps [162], who provides an excellent his-
torical overview of the chlamydial theory, and by Domman
et al. [152]. Both papers show that the suspected chlamydia
connection to plastid origin is founded in phylogenetic arte-
facts—trees that do not withstand critical methodological
inspection. Because of phylogenetic factors and because of
LGT among prokaryotes, trees can be misleading in the
context of inferring endosymbiont origins [41], and it is
prudent to look at other kinds of evidence as well. As it
concerns the origin of mitochondria, Degli-Esposti [163]
surveyed the components of proteobacterial membrane
bioenergetics and inferred that the ancestor of mitochondria
was methylotrophic.
