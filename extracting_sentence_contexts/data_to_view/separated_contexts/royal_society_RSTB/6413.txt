This connexion becomes
gradually very fine and eventually gets resorbed (figs. 2c-e, 3a-c, Plate 1), leaving a
wide empty space between the daughter cells. The way in which the protoplasm is
drawn out in the course of division, and the fact that the protoplasts of the two
daughter cells together fill a space far smaller than the original parental one 20 or
30 min. before, suggest the existence of a strong bipolar tension prior to and during
the division. The new central spines are formed a short time after cell division (fig. 2/,
Plate 1, 8 min.; fig.
