Tinst =
so this assumption is justified if the monopole size (2.4) is less than this, Rom < Tinst- It is easy to
check that this is true if the monopole mass satisfies equation (4.11).

As a simple application, one can consider Schwinger pair production of monopoles by the
LHC magnets, which have field strength |B| ~ 8.3T ~ 1.6 x 10-15 GeV”. Even before any particle
collisions were carried out, the fact that this field did not produce magnetic monopoles when the
magnets were first switched on implies the lower mass bound

for the mass of monopoles.

5. Neutron stars

To improve the bound (4.13), one needs to find stronger magnetic fields. The strongest known
magnetic fields currently existing in the universe are in neutron stars known as magnetars,
