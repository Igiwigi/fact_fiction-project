In the following the stresses are considered from the static point of view,
principally to examine the results produced by changing the form of the stress func-
$tion. Either the electric or the magnetic stress alone may be taken in hand. Start
Zthen, from a knowledge that the force on a magnetic pole of strength m is Rm, where
=R is the polar force of any distribution of intrinsic magnetisation in a medium, the
Ewhole of which has unit inductivity, so that
