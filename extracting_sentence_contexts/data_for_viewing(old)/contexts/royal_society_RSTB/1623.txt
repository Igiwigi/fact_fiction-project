but has no Weberian mechanism, and in which retia mirabilia are either present or
aeanting.” Two questions are suggested by these Fishes: (1) Are thay capable, lke
‘Hie Osiariophysex, of utilizing the ductus pneamaticus as u means of pressure adjust-
qnent? (2) If so, what disadvantage is entailed upon them by the want of a
Welerian mechanism? A negative anawer to the first question renders any further
disendcion unnecessary, inasmuch as the Fishes concerned will be in the same position
4s tnost Physoslisti so far as pressure adjustment is concerned, but an affirmative
peaponss, an the contrary, will necessarily involve the consideration of the second
fiuestion. With regard to the first point the scanty evidence availalile is of a con-
Shadictory charucter, in fact, it is not at all clear in many cases how far the ductus
‘pneumations admits of free communication between the air-bladder and the exterior, in
“gue species only, Murwna conger [Conger vulgaris}, has it been experimentally shownt
@hat gas can be eliminated through the pneumatic duct when the Fish is exposed to
‘Artiticially diminished pressure. On the other hand, the Salmonide are generally
Sredited with the possession of an open duct, but the behaviour of one species of this
@unily, the “ Kileh,” when drawn to the surface from deep water scarcely favours the
Snpposition that any adjustment to reduced pressure by the mechanical liberation of gas

| hn take place in this species. It is true that in this case the pressure reduction was
‘onsiderable, although it can hardly be said to haye ocourred with exceptional rapidity,
Br at agreater rate than probably takes place in many Ostariophysez during ordinary
omvtion. Moreover, in Morrau’s experiments with such Ostariophysex as the Carp
