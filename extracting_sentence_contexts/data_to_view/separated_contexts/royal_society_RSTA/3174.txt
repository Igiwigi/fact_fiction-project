In particular, if y* is a pulse, : 2
meaning ¢*(x) — 0 as |x| — oo, it must have at least one critical point, and hence be unstable (cf. : XS
[2, §2.3]). However, when n > 1, the results of Sturm—Liouville theory no longer apply, and it is : _
not as easy to determine the stability of a pulse solution. : S

The question of pulse stability arose initially from a discussion of Turing patterns, which : s
are spatially periodic patterns that arise in reaction-diffusion systems when a homogeneous : BS
background state becomes unstable in the presence of diffusion. In all contexts in which such 1S

patterns are physically observable, the diffusion coefficients are not all equal (and in fact are quite
different in size). It has been conjectured that this is a necessary condition for the stability, and
hence observability, of Turing patterns. In many situations, the stability of a spatially periodic
pattern can be related to the stability of a nearby pulse.
