In the investigation last referred to it is established,

1. That every system of molecules, constituted as here supposed, has at every point
three axes of elasticity, at right angles to each other.

2. That if these axes be taken as the axes of coordinates, then, in the fundamental
equations of motion, deduced as in my paper, we shall have
and all terms of the same form in like manner = 0; s0 that the equations (13.) of
my paper are reduced to

FE=Z{(pr+ bran) AY
Â© =Z{(pr +4ray?) An} ET Ine, (25)
FE=E{(pr +braw) at}

158 PROFESSOR POWELL'S SUPPLEMENT TO REMARKS ON THE

With the equations in this form we easily pursue the investigation of the dispersion
formula ; and this condition is, in fact, assumed by M. Caveny, by Mr. KeLLanp
and others, though without explicit reference to the axes of elasticity.
