For this reason we
shall drop the specification of the problem as given by the condition (19). Returning to the inequalities (18), we notice that while the central part, 0,°, is a
constant, the extreme parts 0 (E’) and 6 (E’) are particular values of random
variables. In fact, the coordinates of the sample point E are the random variables
(4), and if @ (E) and 6 (E) are single-valued functions of E, they must be random
variables themselves. Therefore, whenever the functions @ (E) and 6 (E) are defined in one way or
another, but the sample point E is not yet fixed by observation, we may legitimately
discuss the probability of @ (E) and 6 (E) fulfilling any given inequality and in
particular the inequalities analogous to (18), in which, however, we must drop
the dashes specifying a particular fixed sample point E’. We may also try to select
6 (E) and 6 (E) so that the probability of 6 (E) falling short of 0,° and at the same
time of 6 (E) exceeding 6,°, is equal to any number « between zero and unity, fixed
in advance.
