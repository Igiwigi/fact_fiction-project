If this small nerve be divided, then
the motions of the eyelids are lost, and they remain open. The inquiries instituted in the first part of this paper, give
a lively idea of the consequences of this imperfection ; show-
ing that the eye being unguarded and unwashed, becomes
dry by evaporation and inflames, and the cornea becomes
opaque. It is unnecessary to point out the importance of
this fact to the operating surgeon. It has been asked, why should this nerve be called respi-
ratory ; and what have the actions of respiration to do with
the eye-lids? The name was given to excite attention to
certain relations ; that the question might be asked, and the
connections of remote parts noticed and remembered.
