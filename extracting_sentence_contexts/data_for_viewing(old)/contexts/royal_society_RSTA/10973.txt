arbitrary divisions differ very considerably among themselves. But a consideration
of the probable errors shows that the differences are sensibly larger than the prob-
able error of the differences, even in some case double ; hence it is not the method
but the assumption of normal correlation for such distributions which is at fault. As
we shall hardly get a better variable than stature to hypothesise normality for, we
see the weakness of the position which assumes without qualification the generality
of the Gausstan law of frequency.

(iii.) We cannot assert that the smaller the probable error the more nearly will
the correlation, as given by the present process, agree with its value as found by
the product moment. If we did we should discard 5213, a very accordant result,
in favour of 5529, or even ‘5939. The fact is that the higher the correlation the
lower, ceteris paribus, the probable error, and this fact may obscure the really best
result. Judging by the smallness of and k and of the probable error, we should
be inclined to select C or the value 5529. This only differs from ‘5198 by slightly
more than the probable error of the difference (‘033 as compared with 029); but
since both are found from the same statistics, and not from different samplings ot
the same population, this forms sufficient evidence in itself of want of normality.
The approximate character of all results based on the theory of normal frequency
must be carefully borne in mind; and all we ought to conclude from the present
