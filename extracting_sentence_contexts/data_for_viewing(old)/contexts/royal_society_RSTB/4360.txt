the skeleton.

Thus two distinct coagulations occur, the first having a comparatively coarse and
irregular structure, whilst the second is much finer and more regular in pattern, the
latter lying within the former.

The secretion in which these changes take place is a colloidal fluid comparatively
rich in organic material, and though at present we have no definite knowledge of the
precise agency or agencies by means of which the transformations described above have
been brought about, yet they are in conformity with similar changes observed in the
solidification of other colloidal media, where these agencies are known.

It is a well-established fact that the proteins in blood serum are separated out by
the addition of certain salts, and that the proteins precipitated vary with the degree
of salt concentration, When ammonium sulphate is employed, precipitation of the
globulins commences with a salt concentration of 24 per cent., and is completed at
36 per cent., and on increasing the concentration to 70-80 per cent. the albumins are
precipitated (Fenton).

Further, certain protein gels take the form of an open network, which is the
