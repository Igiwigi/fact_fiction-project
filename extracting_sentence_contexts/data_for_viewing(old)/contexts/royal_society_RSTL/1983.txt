4. These I believe to be the notions of most persons having a knowledge
of magnetisgm. According to these notions, soft iron can only exhibit magnetic
powers when immediately under the influence of induction ; consequently soft
iron has little or no retentive power within itself, that faculty belonging
exclusively to hardened steel.

5, I have, however, noticed that soft iron, under certain conditions, not only
possesses the power of retaining magnetism, but that this power does not
appear to be weakened by time.

6. Although the fact itself, abstractedly considered, may not be thought of
much consequence, yet, perhaps, viewed in conjunction with many others on the
same 8ubject already before the world, and with other facts probably still to be
revealed, it may be of use in a future classification of magnetic phenomena.

7. The experiments were principally made with four pieces of soft round
bar iron, eighteen inches long, and one inch in diameter; each bent into the
form of a horse-shoe, and furnished with a keeper of soft iron. About twenty
