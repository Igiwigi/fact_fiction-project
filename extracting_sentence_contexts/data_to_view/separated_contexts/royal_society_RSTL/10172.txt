The homogeneousness of the entire sarcodic body, even in the largest and most com-
plicated forms of O. complanata, appears to be further indicated by the fact, that in
gpecimens taken alive and preserved in spirit, the peripheral portion of the cavitary
system is invariably found empty ; the sarcodic body, corrugated by the action of the
spirit, being drawn together towards the central portion of the disk through very
narrow passages of communication, which could only happen with a substance of which
every part is free to move upon every other. Looking, also, to the manner in which
the entire organism receives its nourishment through the marginal pores, and to the
entire absence of any special means for the distribution of that nourishment, I think
it may be fairly assumed that such a protoplasmic circulation goes on throughout life,
as must produce a continual change in the substance of every individual sub-segment. Additional evidence of this homogeneousness is afforded by the two following facts :
first, that in specimens which Jive under conditions peculiarly favourable to their
enlargement, out-growths of irregular shape, but always possessing a regular internal
structure, are put forth from any part of the disk (se © Challenger ” Report, Plate
VII.); and second, that, as in O. tenuissima, every part seems equally capable of
reproducing the entire disk on its characteristic plan. Evolutionary History of the Orbitoline Type,

Thus by the combined study of O. tenuissima and of sub-typical examples of
O. complanata, we are enabled to work out the whole evolutionary history of the Orbi-
toline type, from its simplest to its most complex form. For there can, I think, be no
reasonable doubt, that the snccession here presented to us in the consecutive phases of
two lives, has been the genetic history of this type ; which, originating in the simplest
<jelly-speck ” that could form a shelly chamber, first assumed the form of a spirally-
coiled undivided tube (Cornuspira, fig.
