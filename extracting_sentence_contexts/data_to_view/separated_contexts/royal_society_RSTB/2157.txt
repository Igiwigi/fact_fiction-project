He attributed this temporary abolition to local asphyxia. I have shown that as
regards nerve the primary effects of CO, are to diminish the positive response and to
increase the negative response.t In view of these facts 1 have made a few experi-
ments to see whether the presumably negative-cum-positive response of the retina
could be modified in the sense of a favouring of negative and disfavouring of positive. I had previously seen in some experiments made for another purpose that the retinal
response (positive) was abolished by CO, by Et,O, and by CHCl;, but had not
examined closely the action of CO, upon the retina as I had that of nerve. I cannot say that I have ever seen the eyeball effect precisely as described by
Kiuye.
