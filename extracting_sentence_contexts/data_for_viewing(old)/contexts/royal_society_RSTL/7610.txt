it be required to find the class of the curve enveloped by the line PQ. ; Take an arbi-
trary point O, join OQ, and let this meet the curve minP'; then (EP; P) are points on
the curve m having a (ms, me') correspondence ; in fact to a ava Position of P there,
correspond e' positions of Q, and to each of these m poritions of P'; that is, to each pogi-
tion of P there correspond m«' positions of P'; and similarly to each position of P' there
correspond m!'s positions of P. The curve © is the system of the lines drawn from each
of the «' positions of Q to the point O, hence the curve © does not pass through P, and
we have k=0. Therefore the number of the united points (P, P'), that is, the number
of the lines PQ which pass through the point O, is =m#'+m!'z, or this is the class of
the curve enveloped by PQ.

It is to be noticed that if the two curves are curves in space (plane, or of double
curvature), then the like reasoning shows that the number of the lines PQ which meet
a given line O is =me'+m'z, that is, the order of the scroll generated by the line PQ is
=me'+m'e.
