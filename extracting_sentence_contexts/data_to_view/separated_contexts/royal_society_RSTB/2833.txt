The anatomical structure of the axis, especially of the stele, is best shown in one of
the transverse sections cut from the upper part of the cone, a short distance above
the longitudinal sections (Plate 3, phot. 3). Here the wood is perfectly preserved ;
its general sectional form is triangular, with somewhat concave sides ; each side of the
triangle measures about 1 millim. The primary wood is solid (a fact confirmed by the longitudinal sections (cf. Plate 4, phot. 9); its largest elements lie towards the middle, and range from
80-140, in diameter ; the smallest tracheides are, of course, those of the protoxylem
at the three angles ; these elements may measure as little as 16 in diameter. Two
of the protoxylem-angles are sharp, while the third is more obtuse, but there is no
obvious sign of forking ; the section is evidently cut through an internode.
