The dieback in the centre of the tufts may not be a detrimental

consequence of necromass accumulation as sometimes hypothesized [52] but rather a direct â€œ3
consequence of the dynamics of grass biomass exerting facilitative and competitive non-local :8
interactions of distinct ranges. In our study site, the proportion of necromass is lower than ig
mentioned in the literature, possibly because of a strong grazing pressure. This fact may explain : a

why bare soil was frequently observed at the center of the ring-shaped or doughnut-like
structures (figure 1) in agreement with simulations (figures 6 and 7). Structures of this type are
barely mentioned in literature dealing with alfa (but see [49]). In the absence of model predictions,
several authors may not have been deemed relevant to report and interpret similar structures.
