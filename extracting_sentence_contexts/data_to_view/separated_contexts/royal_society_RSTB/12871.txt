Conditional valuation is especially important when goods are not consumed
alone but together with other goods (joint consumption). For example, animals
eat berries together with leaves and humans may combine bread with butter,
coffee with milk, or pasta with tomato sauce. In this sense, conditional valuation
is ubiquitous in humans, reflecting the fact that goods are almost never valued
independently of each other. Indeed, if they were, consumers would always
use their entire budget for the best value-for-money product. Yet, in the super-
market, we do not see shopping carts filled with only oranges, or only carrot
juice.
