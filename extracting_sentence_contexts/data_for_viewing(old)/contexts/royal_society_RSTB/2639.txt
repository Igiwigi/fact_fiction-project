naturally, an epitheca surrounded each branch.

I conelude, therefore, that the pinnate development of the septa was, generally
speaking, thrust backwards in the life-history of the Madreporarian polyp, sooner in
some groups than in others, sooner in some genera and in some species than others,

until what was a typical feature in the majority of Paleozoic corals became an
extremely exceptional feature as time went on, was limited, in fact, to embryonic
stages and then seemed to vanish. Yet not quite. For the primary mesenteries
develop in the recent Madreporarian polyp in pairs according to an order of develop-
ment exactly corresponding to that observed in the radial skeletal parts of Palseozoic
Madreporaria. Comparative series are given in Diagrams A, B, and F, G, showing
the stages in the development of the mesenteries in the Recent Astroides, and their
correspondence with the primitive order of insertion of septa, still shown in certain
Jurassic genera.

A similar general result has been deduced by Ortmann (“ Beobachtungen an
Steinkorallen von der Siidkiiste Ceylons,” SpEnGEL, ‘ Zoolog. Jahrbiicher,’ vol. 4,
p- 569. Jena, 1889). Ortmann draws attention to the gradual incoming of the
change from bilateral to radial symmetry among Madreporaria. He points out that
