In
the Leptosporangiate Ferns the tapetum is derived as a series of segments from the
central (archesporial ?) cell; this is the case even for the large sporangia of the
Gleicheniaceze and Osmundaceve.{ {

From these facts it appears that cells acting functionally as special nutritive cells—
either disappearing by early disorganisation (“ plasmodialtapete,’ of GorBEL), or
persisting till the. spores are mature (“secretionstapete,” of GoEBEL)—may be
scattered through the sporogenous mass, or derived from the tissues lying outside it,
or be cut off from the sporogenous cell or group of cells. Their similarity is in
function, not in origin : the origin from the wall, or from the sporogenous group, may
vary within the single sporangium, as in Jsoetes or Selaginella, There is even good
reason to recognise progressive changes of origin of the tapetum within certain circles
of affinity ; thus, in the Lycopodium sporangia the definite tapetum is derived from
the sporangial wall, in the smaller sporangia of Selaginella, chiefly from the sporo-
