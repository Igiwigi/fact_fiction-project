if in some other way the moon produced a semi-diurnal magnetic variation of type
B cos (2¢+), where 8 exceeds « by about 90 degrees, provided that B/A is fairly small
and that B increases more quickly than A as the moon’s distance diminishes. The
combination would slightly increase the theoretical variation of amplitude, but this
need only be by a small amount.

Not much importance can be attached to this suggestion, however, since it is
very difficult to conceive of any way, other than tidal, in which the moon could
produce a semi-diurnal variation of terrestrial magnetism. Certainly no appreciable
direct magnetic effect of the moon is at all likely, nor would it, in any case, supply the
desired variation in the present instance, since its effect would be diurnal and not
semi-diurnal. The matter must therefore remain a mystery for the present, but it is
a mystery whose solution may be the clue to some important new fact relating to
magnetism of the atmospheric tides ; it is with this hope that I venture to publish the
preceding very inconclusive discussion.

Tn conclusion it is a pleasure to acknowledge the assistance which has been placed

at my disposal, in the execution of the computations involved in this paper, by the
Government Grant Committee of the Royal Society.
