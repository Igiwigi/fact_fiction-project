ement of volume there are present equal numbers of positive and negative ions, the
‘lation between electromotive force and ponderomotive force is not attained.
Krofessor LoRENTz’s conclusions from his system of equations as to the untenability of
AXWELL’S scheme of stress are in agreement with the results of the present theory ;
But fiom the indications given, it is not clear that he would admit the form here
Seduced for the mechanical forcive exerted by radiation. As this memoir of Lorentz
ily came to hand after the greater part of the present paper had been developed,
phe agreement, so far as it goes, may be taken as additional evidence in favour of the
Salidity of the method of investigation that has been employed.
According to the present views, there is nothing paradoxical in the existence of
turated atoms or ions in which the tivo kinds of electrons do not compensate each
er; and the properties of these ions will be very different from those of neutral
enc. as it is well known that they are. The fact that a neutral molecule,
y HCl, dissociates so that the sume element H is always positive, may possibly be
tibed to the catalytic action of the solvent without whose aid the splitting up
‘ould not occur. When the solvent is water, or it may be for a gaseous body merely
s of moisture, the decomposition is produced by the formation of an aggregate
With the water-molecules which splits easily in only one way; but when the solvent

Sometimes occurs.
40. If we consider a molecule to be made up of, or to involve, a steady configuration
revolving electrons, it will follow that every disturbance of this steady motion will
nyolve radiation and consequent loss of energy. The only steady configuration of
which we can assert that it will remain permanent under all circumstances is, there-
, that one which possesses least total energy. Thus, by extending the conception
