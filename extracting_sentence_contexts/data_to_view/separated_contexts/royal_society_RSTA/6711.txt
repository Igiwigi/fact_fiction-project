and every case calls for special consideration. No great difficulty is confronted when the
only interrupted arm has the direction Or (figure 8) : yp has been determined from (29),
and xp can be expressed (approximately) in terms of yj and y, (2 being a ‘fictitious
point’) by the formula

Xp = 9+ Xa+ (1) Xo» (i)
in which 74 denotes the length of the interrupted arm OP; to the same approximation
we may write

0). = X2— Xo» m7) = Vp—Yo, (ii)

and (dy/dz), can be related with (dy/dr), by the second of (11), written in the equivalent
form

yes (11) B

so, for the point P in figure 8, the required approximation to (30) is

(31)
in which rp, 7, tp, (07) ps (v2) p are known. Eliminating y, between (28) and (31) we

have relations from which special relaxation patterns can be deduced for a point 0
close to the boundary.
