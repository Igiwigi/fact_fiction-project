It is thus possible, that
the germinal vesicle is the parent cell for new cells of the germinal membrane. The
new granulations into which, for instance in Amphibia and Fishes, I saw the ger-
minal spot to become divided, are perbaps young cells in the parent cell.” The
facts recorded in the present memoir show this conjecture, s0 far as it went, to have
been very near the truthf}. 418. Ricyarp Owe, with reference to the germinal vesicle of Birds, justly remarks,
*it is the essential element, of the cicatricula, and the centre from which all snbse-
quent development radiates.”
