required. In fact once the temperatures have been obtained from (77) and the gradients
from (79), the heights could be found accurately by quadrature. This did not seem worth
while, so that the heights given in the tables, though approximately correct, do not
exactly tally with the tabulated temperature-gradients, which are accurate. The tables
are calculated for an assumed molecular weight » = 20, corresponding to once-ionized
calcium, which would seem to be typical for the Sun and Capella ; % is taken to be unity.
