Aniline was introduced by means of the U-tube and was found to be about
one-thirtieth as effective as lead tetraethyl, weight for weight. Ethyl iodide was
found to be about two-thirds as effective as aniline for equal weights of each. The effect of ethyl iodide is interesting in view of the fact that iodine vapour was
found to be ineffective. This is, however, contrary to the experience of Mrpcry,*
who found that iodine vapour suppressed detonation, but is in accordance with the
work of Ecerron and Gates, who state that iodine had little or no effect in raising
the igniting temperature of petrol. The results of these experiments are summarized in Table XXX.
