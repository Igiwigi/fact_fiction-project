which is easily seen to agree with the result given by Brown, or by Apams, ‘ Coll.

so that, in terms of the quantity denoted by g,

This example is chiefly useful here as calling attention to the fact that n’, while
not exactly equal to 1, is near to it, and consequently the factor d/(n?—1) is only
small of the first order in m,. The same weakness occurs in the terms in ¢~', ..., in
