The most striking fact which comes out from the study of this series is the great
radial length of the micropyle, which, from its appearing in practically all the sections,
is shown to be a long narrow crevice, extending throughout the whole length of the
seed from one end to the other. It is thus very different from the more or less tubular
micropyle of the seeds of Phanerogams. Winiramson, who had not the opportunity
of examining a complete series of sections, was unaware of this fact, which appreciably
weakens the resemblance to a true seed, for it is only when cut tangentially, at right
angles to the micropylar crevice, that the characteristic seed-like appearance is
presented. Sections in the other vertical plane (radial with reference to the parent
cone) run parallel to the micropylar opening, and present quite a different appearance. (See phot.
