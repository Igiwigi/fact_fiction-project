More recently, Aguilera and co-workers identified a key

pose a serious threat to genome integrity. role for the FACT ( facilitates chromatin transcription) chromatin


remodelling complex in the resolution of R-loop-mediated
transcription-replication conflicts in yeast. The latter was prob-
ably associated with a specific chromatin environment as it
was preferentially observed at highly transcribed genes [60]. Given that FACT is essential for both transcription and DNA
replication in higher organisms, similar processes are likely to
be at work in human cells [61-63]. To ensure R-loop removal where prevention mechanisms
fail, a number of enzymes exist that can specifically degrade
or unwind RNA:DNA hybrids. R-loop degradation lar-
gely depends on the ribonucleases RNase H1 and 2, which
specifically recognize long and short RNA:DNA hybrids,
respectively, and enzymatically degrade the RNA component
to restore dsDNA [64].
