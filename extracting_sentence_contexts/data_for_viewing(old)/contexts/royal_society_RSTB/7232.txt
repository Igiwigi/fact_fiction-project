333. From the account given above it will be seen that the general lines of the sampling
technique appropriate for the estimation of crop areas have become fairly clear. The prac-
tical usefulness of the method described here has been demonstrated on a country-wide
scale. Fresh theoretical problems (which may be broadly described as space generaliza-
tions of the theory of sampling distributions and estimation) have been opened up. Much,
however, still remains to be done, and active work is proceeding on both theoretical and

experimental lines in Calcutta on both uni-stage and multi-stage sampling. In conclusion,
I should again like to emphasize the essentially co-operative nature of the undertaking,
and the fact that the credit for the advances already made belongs to the large group of
my fellow-workers in the statistical as well as field branches of the project.

334. I have already mentioned that, at the time of writing the paper, I did not have
access to the Statistical Library which had been removed from Calcutta as an evacuation
measure. Recently, I had the opportunity of looking up a number of papers during a
visit to Giridih where the books are stored at present. I did not have time for an exhaustive
search, and I shall refer in this Note to such papers only as were readily available, and to
such portions of these papers only as have any bearing on the topics discussed in the
present paper.
