Objections have been raised to ScoRESBY's experiments, on the ground that they do
not accord with those of Martins and Bravais, which were made with more exact
modern instruments. But these observers themselves accept SCORESBY's observations as
true, subject to small corrections. The differences between them are, in fact, more
apparent than real, and arise chiefly from the circumstance that their observations were
made in the months of July and August, when the temperature of the air averaged from
35* to 45®, and that of the surface-water from 38* to 42?, whereas ScoresBy experimented
in April and May, when these had temperatures respectively of 20? to 34” and of 28* to
307, 80 that the relative differences between the surface and the deep waters are neces-
sarily yery different in the two cages. In the experiments at depths below 2000 feet
there is little discordance after applying the corrections employed by Martins and
Bravais. The latter, however, took no depth exceeding 2854 feet, while ScormsBr gives
