of the upper contour of the insertion of P, (Nos. 125s, 53p, 168, 1138, 1108, 110a,
123a), while for one, No. 338, the level could not be determined since the necessary
sections were missing. (The remaining apex of these nine was No. 378.) On the
other hand, out of 21 apices belonging to “‘ doubles” in which I, and I, converged
towards the wound, only five were formed on plants in which the halves were united

above the level of insertion of P, (Nos. 125a, 53a, 16a, 113a, 1238), while for one,
No. 33a, the level could not be determined.

The following explanation of these facts may be suggested. The surface of the
normal apex in this species rises only slightly above the bases of the youngest leaves,
especially in the first half of the plastochron, as was pointed out in section 3. Conse-
quently when the apex was first split the base of the wound must always have been
well below the upper contour of the insertions of the P,’s, and even the top of the
wound cannot have been more than a very little above that level. It is therefore
clear that in the plants in which the halves were afterwards found to be united above
the level of insertion of the P,’s, the greater parts of the cut surfaces and probably the
whole of them must have re-united. These re-unions would not by themselves
affect the positions of I, and I,, since in any case leaves are not formed from the
surfaces of deep wounds such as these, as we found previously (1931, 1933). But
