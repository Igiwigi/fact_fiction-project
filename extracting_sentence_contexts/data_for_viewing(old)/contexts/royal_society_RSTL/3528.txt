In experiment No. III. the volume of hydride of ethyl is considerably less than that
required by the above formula, owing no doubt to its solubility in the acidulated
water used as the confining fluid; in fact a similar error, to a less extent, occurred
in the corresponding experiment with zincmethyl*; but to place the cause of error
beyond all doubt, the following additional determination was made. Into a graduated
endiometer tube, filled with mercury, an indefinite quantity of zincethyl, enclosed in
a glass bulb, was introduced, the capillary stem of the bulb being broken inside the
eudiometer tube. A few drops of water were now passed up into the same tube, and
the apparatus was exposed to a heat gradually raised to the boiling-point of zincethyl,
the conversion of which into hydride of ethyl and oxide of zinc was thus perfectly
effected, whilst a few drops of water only exerted an absorptive action upon the
former. After the apparatus had again become cold, the following observations
were made ;—
