If we apply the preceding discussion to the losses
in two water vessels, which are joined together without any intervening H,SO,, it is
manifest that the second vessel will lose more than the first. If the dimensions of the
two vessels are the same and if the rate of change of temperatures is slow and its range
sufficiently restricted, the first vessel will on balance suffer no loss. This result is due
to the fact that in the first operation (that of heating) the first vessel loses a quantity of
vapour which during the subsequent cooling is returned to it by the air passing through
vessel 2 provided that no condensation takes place in the connecting U-tubes. The following considerations, which avoid the postulate that an air-vapour mixture
obeys the gas laws give us a general method for calculating the maximum loss in any

vessel containing a volatile liquid—we say maximum advisedly—for, as far as we can
see, any departure from the ideal conditions contemplated will reduce the loss. Both the “2nd vessel ’’* and the “ H and ©” losses can be calculated thus :

Consider the flask shown in fig. 1 where Py, P, and P, are the positions taken by
a weightless, frictionless piston under conditions to be explained.
