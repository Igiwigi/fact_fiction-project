Tt is remarkable that, over the firs six years after the cessation
of the application of the manure, the average produce was almost exactly the same as,
and even rather more than, during the eight years of the application, namely, 4846 Ibs ;
and the average annual increase was also almost identical, being 2147 lbs. This result
was, indeed, partly due to one or two of the six years being seasons of very high
productiveness ; but still it is very striking. During the next six years there was one
8eason of unusual drought, and others of much less than average productiveness ; and,
under these circumstances, together with the fact that the then remaining residue
would doubtless be in a less readily available condition, there was little more than half
as much average produce, and less than two-fifths as much average increase, as over
the first six years of the action of the manurial residue. Still, there was an increase of
between 6 and 7 ewts. of hay, due to the residue, in 1875, the twelfth year after the
cessation of the application of the manure, and of more in 1876 and 1877,

The table further shows that very much more nitrogen was removed in the crops
during the first, than during the second six years, of the action of the residue. But
the amount was not, as was that of the hay, as much per acre per annum over the first
8Ix years as it had been over the eight of the application ; and over the second six
years there was little more than half as much as over the first six, and the average
annual increase was only about 44 Ibs., against 16 Ibs. over the first six years.
