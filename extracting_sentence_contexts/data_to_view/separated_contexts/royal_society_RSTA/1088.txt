However, the index of


refraction for the high-harmonic light generated (at harmonic number q) is incrementally less
than 1; ie. Ngw =1â€”dgo. This is the result of the fact that all the atomic resonance lines that
contribute to the index of refraction are at frequencies higher than the driving laser, and lower
than the generated harmonics. However, when the strong laser field starts to ionize the gas,
previously bound electrons become free, and provide a negative contribution to the index of
refraction of the driving laser. At a critical ionization fraction, the indices of refraction of the driving
laser and the harmonic light match [92,94].
