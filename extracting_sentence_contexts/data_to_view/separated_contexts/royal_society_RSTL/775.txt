If subsequent experiments prove that
the true sap descends through'the alburnum, it will be easy to
point out the cause why trees continue to vegetate after all
communication between the leaves and roots, through the bark,
has been intercepted: and why some portion of alburnous
matter is in all trees* generated below incisions through the
bark. It was my intention this year to have troubled you with some
observations on the reproduction of the buds and roots of trees;

* I have in a former paper stated that the perpendicular shoots of the vine form an
exception. I spoke on the authority of numerous experiments ; but they had been
made late in the summer; and on repeating the same experiments at an earlier period,
I fqund the result in conformity with my experiments on other trees,


the true Sap of Trees is deposited during Winter, 10g

but as the subject of the Paper, which I have now the honour
to address to you, appeared to be of more importance, I have
deferred those observations to a future opportunity ; and I shall
at presentonly observe, that I conceive myself to be in possession
of facts to prove that both buds and roots originate from the
alburnous substance of plants, and not, as is, I believe, generally
supposed, from the bark. I am, &c.
