10. Rate of growth from the vapour

Let us first consider the simplest case of one screw dislocation in an otherwise perfect
crystal surface. The rate of growth will then be given by (48), where v,, is the rate of advance
of the steps, far from the centre of the spiral.

The value of v,, has been calculated in I, formula (24), that is to say,

Us» = 2ox,vexp (—W/KT) tanh (yo/2x,) co(%o, Yo), (46)

where @ is the supersaturation, x, the mean displacement of adsorbed molecules, v a frequency
factor, W the evaporation energy, y) the distance between successive turns of the spiral, / a
factor taking account of the fact that perhaps the exchange of molecules between the step
and the adsorbed layer is not rapid enough to maintain around them the equilibrium
concentration of adsorbed molecules, and ¢, another factor, which is a function both of yo
and of the distance x) between kinks in the steps, and given in general by formula (25), I.
According to the estimates made in I for x, and x) we expect the condition x, > xp to be satisfied
in most cases; then the factor cy is of the order of 1, and the rate of advance of the steps is
independent of their orientation. In this case, using (46) and (44) for the distance y, between
successive turns of the spiral, (43) becomes

R= fOngv exp (—W/kT) (0?/0,) tanh (c,/c), (47)
where o, = (2mp,/x,) o = 2nya/kTx, (48)
(cf. I, equation (30)). For low supersaturations (0 <o,) we obtain the parabolic law
R= fOngv exp (—W/kT) o?/0,. (49)
