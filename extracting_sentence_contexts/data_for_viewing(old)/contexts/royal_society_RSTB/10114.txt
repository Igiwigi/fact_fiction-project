dently classified as hypsodont with two longitudinal lophs
(cutting edges) on its molar teeth, regardless of whether
that morphology is actually present on the fossil in question.
In some cases, the ecometric scores of entire families can be
set in this way; in others, taxonomic resolution at the genus
or even species level is required. It follows that the quality
of taxon identification is crucial and also that all sufficiently
precisely identified fossil occurrences in space and time can
be used, rather than only the few trait-bearing specimens,
maximizing sampling density.

It is a property of ecometric analysis that it captures sig-
nals at short timescales, despite the fact that the evolution
of hypsodonty—as well as deep structural properties such
as the number of cutting edges—is typically much slower
than environmental change. Ecometric patterns reflect
changes in the distribution of taxa as found, not their morpho-
logical evolution, and is thus a phenomenon taking place on
‘ecological’ rather than on ‘evolutionary’ timescales in the con-
ventional sense. It follows that ecometric patterning, while at
any one time probably reflecting the distribution of selection
pressures, does not possess phylogenetic or other inertia,
and in that sense is comparable to other short-term signals,
such as sedimentary properties and stable isotope ratios.
