side to side. A careful examination of serial sections is necessary to distinguish
these latter from the intrafilamentar septa. The presence of the septum must have a
marked influence on the course of the blood stream, and a few paragraphs devoted to
the discussion of this point will be found on p. 170. Speaking in a general way, the
intrafilamentar septum is common among the Filibranchia, and occurs in two Pseudo-
lamellibranch families—Spondylide and Pectinide, So far as present observations
go, it is met with in none of the Eulamellibranchia except Lyonsia nitida and Astarte
borealis.

In those cases where the filaments are in organic connection, either of an inter-
lamellar or interfilamentar kind, the chitin also is continuous. These connections are
mainly of loose lacunar tissue, covered by epithelium; and extremely thin films of
chitin cover the lacunar cells, and, in fact, form a sponge-work in which the cells are
embedded. The continuity of this chitin with the thicker chitin of the filaments can
be easily made out in well preserved and well stained material.

Tn those Lamellibranchia with organic interfilamentar junctions (¢.e., the Eulamelli-
branchia plus the Pinnide, Ostreide, and Limidze—an assemblage which it is
proposed to term the Synaptorhabda, see p. 186), the chitin in these junctions is
remarkably thick and fibrous in character. It is continuous with the chitin of the
filaments, which at the levels of the interfilamentar junctions is much thicker than
usual, the thickening taking place at the expense of the filamentar cavity. In fact,
in a great many of the forms the cavity of the filament, even in the regions between
the interfilamentar junctions, can hardly be said to exist, an obliteration of the space
being effected either by the excessive thickening of the chitin, or by an exceptional
