where I, is the intensity at the “centre” of the line—only the case of symmetrical
broadening is at present contemplated—and I the intensity at a distance w from the
“ centre,” measured on the wave-length scale, and / a constant.

The assumption has usually been made hitherto that the broadening associated
with the condensed discharge also followed the probability law, although the actual
amount of broadening is of another order of magnitude under suitable conditions. In
fact any other supposition raises difficulties in the physical interpretation according
to any suggestions yet put forward. It has never been implied that the effect may
not be complex, and due to the joint action of several causes. The broadened line
might therefore be formed by the superposition of several probability curves—one
arising from each cause—and the resultant intensity law might then cease to be of
the usual type, although that type pertained to each of its components. Cases of
unsymmetrical broadening can also come into the scope of such a view.

Perhaps the most fundamental result which emerges from a preliminary inspection of
the plates is the necessity of abandoning this view. The plates contain photographic
records of the intensity curves—showing variation of intensity with wave-length—
across certain lines, and although the traces on the plates are not the actual intensity
curves, which may be derived from them by a simple formula, yet abrupt changes of
