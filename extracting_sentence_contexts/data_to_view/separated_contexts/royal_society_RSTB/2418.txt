On the other
hand, the genera Gileichenia, Matonia, Loxsoma, Hymenophyllum, Trichomanes,
Dennstedtia, Microlepia, and Hypolepis all have either a single solid stele, or a
cylindrical one, with or without internal accessory steles. This may be a mere
concomitant of the creeping habit and solitary insertion of the leaves. But whatever
the reason, it provides material for interesting comparisons.* The vascular supply to
â€˜the leaf, and its mode of insertion on that of the axis also provides useful facts. A
single stele enters the petiole in Osmunda, Matonia, Loxsoma, Schizeacea,
Gleicheniacew, Hymenophyllaces, &e. The uniformity of this simple condition
becomes the more important when it is remembered how frequently in Ferns with a
mixed sorus the leaf-trace is composed of numerous smaller steles.
