Material. Holotype, 102 mm in diameter, and at least five smaller specimens, not,
however, definitely distinguishable from F. clarkei when immature (784357).

Description. Of the known Australian material, this species is the stoutest whorled and
the most coarsely ribbed, and its ribbing is more often visibly biplicate. The keel is strong

and wide but blunt and never floored; it is as strong as ever at the end of the largest
specimen (diameter 102 mm.). The fact that this specimen is still wholly septate shows
that F. fairbridgei is a large species. Sutures where visible are as in F. clarket (in which they
are much better displayed). The test is completely preserved over almost the whole of all

the material.

Comparisons. The peculiar backward biplication of blunt ribs exemplified in this species
can be best matched among European Bajocian material in FP. grammoceroides (Haug), the
type species. The holotype of Fâ€™. fairbridgei is similar in essentials to the largest specimen
in the Buckman collection (Sedgwick Museum), well figured by Buckman, 1892, pl. xlvi,
