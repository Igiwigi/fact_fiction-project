272 CAPTAIN W. DE W. ABNEY ON THE TRANSMISSION

It should be remarked that the methods adopted in determining the absorptior
by astronomers practically eliminated any variation due to haze, since the stars we
compared inter se, which is what the method employed in the foregoing observation
also does, though in a more complete manner.
