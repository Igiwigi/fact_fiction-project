the root lies exactly opposite one of the protoxylem strands of the stem. The base
of the root has formed some secondary wood, which is continuous with that of the
parent stem. The phloém is not shown in this root, but can be recognized in the
next, which, as well as the third one, is cut somewhat tangentially. In all the roots
the limits of their cortex can be traced. The stem has formed a much larger amount
of secondary wood near the bases of the roots than elsewhere. This wood is chiefly
developed above the insertion of the roots, i.c., in the direction towards the apex of
the stem, as determined by the course of the leaf-trace bundles. The pericycle has also
undergone an enormous thickening, with tangential cell-divisions, around the bases of
the roots. Between their bases secondary tissue, partly consisting of wood, has been
formed in the pericycle in a very anomalous manner; much of this tissue is seen in
transverse section, so the direction of the tracheides must have been tangential with
reference to the stem. There seems, in fact, to have been a special “réseau
radicifere,” as it is called by Van T1eqHem,*t in connection with the bases of these
roots.

In fig. 29 we have shown a curious structure which we think may probably repre-
sent a very young root enclosed within the cortex of the stem. The section is a
nearly complete transverse one of a good-sized stem with a considerable amount of
secondary wood. The root-like organ is embedded in the cortex, immediately
beneath the outer sclerenchymatous layer, and is seen in approximately transverse
section.

A central cylinder can be distinguished, but we could detect no lignified elements.
