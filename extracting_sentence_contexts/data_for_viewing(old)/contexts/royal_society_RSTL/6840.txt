8. Of the ganglion-cells of the heart.

Although the description given in this paper will apply to the ganglion-cells of ganglia
in different parts of the frog, including those distributed to the heart and lungs, I feel it
necessary to refer particularly to the cardiac ganglia of the frog, because KGLLIKER has
recently made some very confident statements with regard to the structure, arrangement,
and action of these ganglia, which my observations fail to confirm. Nor is the differ-

A ence between us one of interpretation ; we are at variance as to actual facts. With
8 reference to the ganglia of the heart this observer says, * It may be particularly men-
E tioned that the origin of nerve-fibres from unipolar cells, and the rarity of the double
= origin of fibres, may be especially well seen in one place, namely, in the septum of the
& heart of the frog, where also R. WAaGxER admits the fact. .. .. . Here als0 we may most
Treadily convince ourselves that there are many apolar cells without processes, as is most
Splainly 8hown. in the heart-ganglia, and in the small ganglia upon the urinary bladder of
= Z the Bombinator, in which, as also in similar ganglia of the frog, the matter is as clear as
= possible tag”

But in his Croonian Lecture last year, his opinion as to apolar cells has become

-2 euriously modified. Although the existence of such cells was as *clear as possible” in
21860, great doubts are expressed upon the matter only two years afterwards :—* These
Scells, that is to say, all of them which are connected with nerve-fibres and whose con-
E nexions can be clearly made out, are unipolar, or send out but a single fibre, and that in
Sa peripheral direction, without having any connexion with the transcurrent fibres of the
