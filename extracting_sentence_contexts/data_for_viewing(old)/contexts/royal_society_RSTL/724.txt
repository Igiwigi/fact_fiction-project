The cause of this seems to be, that a number of other pro-
ducts are simultaneously formed, all of which require more or
less of carbon as a constituent ingredient, so that, in consequence
of the affinities which prevail under the existing circumstances,
formation of the new wood : that there is not a continual accumulation of tannin in
the vegetables which afford it, as it is successively formed in and with the white cor-
tical layers, and is successively decomposed by concurring to form new wood: and,
Jastly, that as the yegetable approaches more nearly to the full maturity of its growth,
when wood is less rapidly and less plentifully formed, so in like manner less taniin is
secreted, for the fabric being nearly completed, fewer materials are required.

Such I am inclined to suspect, from the facts which have been adduced, to be the
cause and mode by which tannin is formed in oaks and other vegetables, but I make

this statement only as a probable conjecture, which may be refuted or confirmed by
future observations.


312 Mr, HarenzTt's additional Experiments

some bodies by treatment with nitric acid afford but little, and
others none of the tanning substance.

The greatest proportion of this -Substance was yielded by
