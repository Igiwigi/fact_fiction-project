156 PROFESSOR OSBORNE REYNOLDS ON ROLLING-FRICTION.

cause of resistance to rolling, is the tendency which a roller has to oscillate about any
position in which it may be placed on a flat surface.

Howeyer true and hard the roller and the surface may be, if the roller is but slightly
disturbed it will not move continuously in one direction until it gradually comes to rest,
but it will oscillate backwards and forwards through a greater or less angle, depending
on the softness of the material. 'These oscillations are not due to the roller having
settled into a hollow. This is strongly implied by the fact that the more care is taken
to make the surfaces true and s8mooth the more regular and apparent do the oscillations
become. But even if this is not a sufficient proof—if it is impossible to snppose that
an iron roller on an iron plane can be made 80 true that when the one is resting on the
other it will not be able to find some minute irregularities or hollows in which to
settle—still we must be convinced when we find the same phenomenon existing when
india-rubber is substituted for iron, and in such a marked degree that no irregularities
there may be in the surface produce any effect upon it, much less serye to account
for it.

These phenomena, with others, have led me to conclude that there is a definite canse
for the resistance to rolling besides the mere crushing of the surface or accidental
irregularities of shape, a cause which is connected with the softness of the material as
