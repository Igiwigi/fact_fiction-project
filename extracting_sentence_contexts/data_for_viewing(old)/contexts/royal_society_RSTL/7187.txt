Sbservable in a sample of sea-water taken at 50* 3L' 8. lat., at a distance of 15* of lati-
Zude, or 900 English miles from the mouth of the river; at about the same distance,
he water of the North-Atlantic Sea suffered a considerable depression in salinity, pro-
Sably owing to the water of the St. Lawrence. This influence is of a double kind,
Fartly in diluting the sea-water, partly in mixing it up with organic substances that
will occasion its decomposition by putrefaction.

'The polar currents contain less salt, than the equatorial. I have determined the
quantity and nature of the salts in two very well-defined polar currents, —the West-
Greenland polar current, with 33:176 per 1000 alt, and the Antarctic polar or Pata-
gonian current, on the west side of South America, which contains 33-966. It is highly
interesting to observe that the East Greenland current, which according to its geogra-
Phical relations might be considered as a polar current, which in fact has been con-
Sidered in that way, has a very high mean quantity of salt, viz. 35:278 per 1000, while
the sea to the north of Spitzbergen, according to one analysis, contains 33-623 per 1000
8alt. IT think I sﬆhall afterwards, from other phenomena also, prove that the Kast

Greenland current is a returning branch of the Gulf-stream ; but I may here remark
that the great quantity of salt which it contains almost by itself proves the more equa-
torial nature of this current.
