care has to be taken concerning the ghost points at ¢y+1 and ¢_1. This is the discrete analogue
to not imposing boundary conditions on (1.1). A similar situation occurs in state-constrained
problems for Hamilton-Jacobi equations.

(b) Paradigm shift

According to Kuhn [18], a paradigm shift corresponds to a change in a basic assumption within
the ruling theory of science. Classical cases of paradigm shifts are the transition from Ptolemaic
cosmology to Copernican one, the development of quantum mechanics which replaced classical
mechanics on the microscopic scale or the acceptance of Mendelian inheritance as opposed to
pangenesis.

A common assumption in theoretical models for research dynamics is the fact that scientists

are rewarded from recognition from others [19,20]. This recognition may take the form of :§
citations, prizes or other financial incentives and is further amplified by scientific activity, such as a)
conferences and collaborations, in this field. Bensancenot & Dogguy [17] modelled a paradigm 1S
shift in a scientific community by a two-state mean field game approach and analysed the : =
competition between two different scientific hypotheses. In our example, we consider a simpler as)
model, but follow their general ideas and assumptions. :8

Let us consider a scientific community with N researchers working on two different : 3
hypotheses. Each researcher working on paradigm i, i=1,2, wants to maximize his/her [&

productivity measured by a cost function of the form (3.1). Here, the function f =f(i,@)
