By far the
best periscopic combination I am acquainted with, consists of
a double convex lens of the best form, but placed in its worst


compound lenses and olyect-glasses. 249

position, for the Jens next the eye, and a plano-concave whose
focal length is to that of the other as 9:6: 1 or as 1g: 5,
placed in contact with its flatter surface and having its con-
cavity towards the object, as in Pl. XIX. fig. 6, for the farthest :
yet for destroying the aberration of rays parallel to the axis,
nothing can be worse. In fact our formula (p) gives for the
aberration in this construction
D = 99-302

or about 22 times what the best single lens of equal power
would give: yet on accidentally combining two such lenses in
this manner, I was immediately struck with the remarkable
extent of oblique vision,* with the absence of fatigue, on read-
ing some time with a power much beyond that of the natural
eye,and with the freedom from colour at the edges of the field,
arising from the opposition of the prismatic refractions of the two
solids, an advantage which a single meniscus does not poszess. Theory of object-glasses; and first, of the destruction of the chro-
matic aberration, or the imperfections arising from the different
refrangibility of the rays of light.

15 The perfection of an object-glass requires that parallel
or diverging rays of all colours incident on every point of the
glass, should converge to one! and the same point, and con-
sequently, that we should have f invariable and Af zero, for
all the colours of the spectrum. With regard to the latter

* The focal length of the compound lens tried, was 1*84 inch ; the field of tole-
rably distinct vision extended full 40Â® from the axis, and the forms of objects were
distinguishable (the letters of a book might be read) with management, as far as the

75th degree.
