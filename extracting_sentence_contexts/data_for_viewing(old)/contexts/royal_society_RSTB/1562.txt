regarding the formation of various kinds of corpora lutea; a detailed description of
these experiments I hope to publish before long, here I will treat solely of the dis-
charged Graafian follicles in M. rhesus.

Out of forty-three adult females of M. rhesus which were examined, twenty-two of
them had no sign of a corpus luteum, or as I will call it a “discharged follicle,” in
either ovary ; of these, fourteen were menstruating females, while the remaining eight
were not menstruating at the time. On the other hand in twenty-one females a more
or less prominent discharged follicle was present; of these, sixteen were pregnant
females, or females which had very recently borne or aborted their young ; while of the
remaining five, one was a female which I am inclined to think had aborted her young,
but Iam not certain of the fact and consider this case doubtful (fig. 7), one was a
non-pregnant, non-menstruating female (fig. 8), and three only were females in which
menstruation was in progress at the time they were killed (figs. 5, 6 and 9).

Thus, out of seventeen menstruating females, three only were found, in the ovaries

of which there was any sign of the existence of a discharged follicle. Of these three
discharged follicles, one is undoubtedly the remains of a follicle long since discharged
(fig. 5), it occurred in a female killed during Stage V. of menstruation ; one is equally
certainly, as I will show below, not of recent origin, it occurred in a female killed
during Stage IV. of menstruation (fig. 6); and one only is a recently discharged
follicle (fig. 9), and it was present in the ovary of a female killed during Stage VII. of
menstruation.
