coloured, being in fact a function of the wave-length of the incident light. Thus, there is
a sensation corresponding to every part of the spectrum. Not three, or even four, primary
colours, but many.’ That is to say, what Wundt proposed was a polychromatic theory of
vision. Now followed a period in which new theories of colour vision appeared with almost
monotonous regularity.

Recently this spate of theories has abated, and workers have turned their attention to
research, rather than to invention. During this period the three-colour theory of Thomas
Young has played a most vital part; for first there was three-colour printing, then three-
colour photography, and lastly technicolour. Not only has Thomas Young’s theory played
an essential part in the growth of new methods of colour reproduction, but in precise colour
measurement as well. Also it provided a most valuable classification for the colour-blind.
So that, even if it should prove to be a fact that human vision is not trichromatic, and that
Young’s theory has had its day, yet the heritage which it will leave behind will continue
for many years to come, in practical applications of many kinds, possibly even colour
television.

(142) Colour mixture determinations

Some years ago the author collected all the evidence available at that time, for and
against Young’s three-colour theory, because it had been noticed that many observers,
using different methods for investigating a wide range of visual phenomena, had found the
basis of three primary sensations insufficient to account completely for their experimental
results. That evidence, which consisted of notes, reference cards and reprints, was destroyed
by fire when incendiary bombs were dropped on the City of London in 1942. The evidence
