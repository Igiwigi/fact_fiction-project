by the inferior frontal convolution, while the opposite occasionally occurs.

The fact that both the inferior as well as the midfrontal convolutions increase in man
compared to monkeys and apes explains another feature of the human midfrontal, viz.,
its more dorsal location* that causes, more frequently than in anthropoids, parts of it
to be taken for, or even be superposed upon, the superior frontal (¢f. also SeRai’s
excellent work on this subject : 1913, 1926).

It is clear that the tendency of the short but usually quite regular inferior
temporal sulcus of anthropoids to break up in man in various pieces (either transverse
or longitudinal fissurets) must also be explained along the same lines. Woo.Larp (loc.
cit. IL) showed that the acoustic cortex, especially the relation between the depth of the
supra- and infra-granular layers is less developed in the Australian aboriginal brain, a fact
that fits in very well with the findings of van Noort (1917) in the Madurese and with the
fact that this cytotectonic field is late in phylogeny to acquire its typical characteristics
(BropMANN). As in the second temporal convolution, the temporo-pontine fibres arise ;
pragmatic functions may also act a part here as they do in field 9 of the frontal region.
Exxior Sire (1927) has also pointed to the evolutionary importance of the temporal
region in connection with pragmatic functions.

Tn this breaking up of sulci we have the opposite of the confluence of sulci in becoming
adapted to cytotectonic and functional fields, so evident in the Rolandic which,
represented by the coronal and ansate of carnivores, is usually still indicated, even in
lemurs, by two fissurets, but in all monkeys is a homogeneous fissure. Similarly the
calloso-marginal is still represented in the former by two fissures, the genual and the
