When a. solution of oxymuriatic acid in water is -electrized,
oxymuriatic acid and oxygene appear* at the positive surface,

* The quantity of oxymuriatic acid in the aqueous solution, is s0 small, that the
principal products must be referred to the decomposition of water. This happens in

other instances ; the water only is decomposed in dilute solutions of nitric and sul-
phuric acids.

and hydrogene at the negative surface, facts which are certainly
unfavourable to. the idea of the existence of hyperoxygenised
muriatic acid, whether it be imagined a compound of oxy-
muriatic acid with oxygen?, or the basis of oxymuriatic acid.

If the facts respecting the hyperoxymuriate of potash,
indeed, be closely reasoned upon, it must be regarded as
nothing more than as a triple compound of oxymuriatic acid,
potassium, and oxygene. We have no right to assume the
existence of any peculiar acid in it, or of a considerable por-
tion of combined water ; and it is perhaps more conformable
to the analogy of chemistry, to suppose the large quantity of
oxygene combined with the potassium, which we know has an
