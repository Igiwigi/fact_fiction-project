6. Toward a comprehensive framework for

conscious audition

Further specifications of the NCCza, their relationship to atten-
tion and other cognitive variables, and the potential system-
level effects of conscious perception are needed in determining
the plausibility of the models summarized in §2. At present,
there is little consensus concerning these questions, either
empirically or in the models, which vary widely in their
emphasis. This stems at least in part from (i) diverse definitions
on what consciousness is or does, (ii) confounds related to the
nature of paradigms used to examine it, and (iii) the fact that
most models derive exclusively from vision. Given potentially
fundamental differences between vision and audition outlined
earlier, it may prove difficult—at least initially—to incorporate
findings from the auditory domain into a generalized, parsi-
monious account of the neural basis of conscious perception,
and it may be necessary to combine specific features of
different models into a larger, overarching framework.

(a) Isolating the NCC,
Recent years have seen a dramatic rise in studies attempting
to identify neural correlates of conscious perception. While
this is particularly true in vision, our review of the literature
