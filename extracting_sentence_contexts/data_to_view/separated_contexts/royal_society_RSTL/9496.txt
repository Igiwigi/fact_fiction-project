Tn th
case of large air-sparks the mirror when revolving at a high velocity exhibits a «lick
haziness on one side of the image of the 8lit, showing that the dying out of the ha
phorescence is not quite instanstaneous, though very nearly 80. It will thus be seen that the phosphorescence produced by the separate discharg
of an intermittent current must be very intense, seeing that the periods during wh
the glass is brightly illuminated by it are extremely short, compared with the Period
that intervene, and yet the intensity of the apparent illumination of the glass
greater than with the continuous current. This shows that the particles must I»
driven off at a greater velocity or in greater numbers during the short period occupi |
by an individual pulse of the intermittent discharge than during the continuous dis
charge—a difference that would naturally follow from the fact that the electricity in
each of these individual discharges represents the total accumulation of the period
between two discharges. But it is remarkable that the vanes of a radiometer, wh
used as the negative terminal of a vacuum tube, as in Crooks” experiments, rev0
very much more quickly under the influence of a continuous discharge than an inter
mittent one. If an air-spark of increasing length be introduced into the current 6
a Horrz machine that is driving a radiometer electrically, the driving power
gradually diminish, and ultimately cease.
