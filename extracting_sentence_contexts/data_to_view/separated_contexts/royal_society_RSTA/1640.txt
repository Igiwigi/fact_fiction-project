To
isolate the perturbed profiles from the unperturbed profiles, we found the time steps and locations
that the upwardly propagating wave from the original simulations passed through the height of
formation of the 6301 A and 6302 A line pair. We took this as an optical depth of log, t = —0.5 to
—1.5, as studies suggest that this is roughly the region where the line forms [70]. We took a range
of optical depths to account for the fact that the optical depth is likely to vary in different regions
of the tube and in the presence of the wave. Taking a range of optical depths ensures that we catch
the propagation of the wave as it passes through that region of the atmosphere. Then we applied
similar methods to profiles that were deemed as perturbed by the passage of the wave and those
that were deemed unperturbed.
