As a distribution is uniquely determined by all of its moments under
the Hamburger moment problem conditions, hydrodynamics for all the conserved charges is, at
least possibly, equivalent to a kinetic theory description of the evolution of p(k, x, t). What form would we expect such an evolution equation for the pseudomomentum to take? In
an integrable model, quasi-particles interact with each other through phase shifts: the initial and
final momenta of two particles going through a collision are preserved, but there is a scattering
phase shift. (In fact the Yang—Baxter equation, which we have used to name a class of integrable
models, is an expression of how scattering phase shifts for three particles are determined by the
two-particle scatterings and independent of their sequence.) According to Wigner, an energy-
dependent phase shift can be interpreted as a time delay, i.e. particles of one momentum k are
delayed by passing through particles of another momentum k’. [=

We thus should expect a Boltzmann-like equation with no collisions that rearrange momentum : 3
but with a velocity at each point that depends on the distribution of other particles,

d:o(k, x, t) + dx(u[{o(k, x, H}lo(k, x, #)) = 0. (3.10) S

The only part of this ‘Bethe-Boltzmann’ equation requiring Bethe ansatz methods is the a]
calculation of the self-consistent backflow that determines the velocity functional v[] (for the case DNS
of the XXZ model, this was done in [6]). Hydrodynamic solutions (ignoring previous attempts that aon
did not correctly capture the self-consistency) and derivations of (3.10) or closely related forms as)
have been investigated for the two-reservoir quench for Lieb-Liniger [5] and XXZ [6,10,47,48] .
and shown to work exactly in the scaling limit. More recently, solutions have been investigated for
general initial conditions in these models [7,8], including at T = 0, where interesting connections
to normal hydrodynamics appear [49].
