distance (about g0*) of « Lyrz g" greater in the beginning
of December or February than in the beginning of August
(these are about the middle times of the winter and summer
observations). The Greenwich instrument finds, by twenty
observations in summer, and twenty in winter, the double
altitude (about 154*) of « Lyra exactly the same.

Comparing these naked facts together, the first impression
would be, notwithstanding the greater number of observa-
tions at Dublin, that the Greenwich result is more likely to
