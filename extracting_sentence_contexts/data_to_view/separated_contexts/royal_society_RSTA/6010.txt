Accordingly, we give the scaling some prominence. The Poisson scaling approach is new in the theory of elastic waves, and we believe it offers
scope for new forms of shell theory in which it is adopted at the outset in the energy functional
chosen, thus extending to thicker shells the theory in such classical works as [9]. Although we
concentrate on the frequencies and wavenumbers for which backward propagation occurs, the
method of Poisson scaling is in fact general; it may be used at any frequency and wavenumber,
and also in nonlinear elastic problems [10,11]. Potential applications of the work are to modern
materials such as homogenized media and composites with tunable parameters, including
nanotubes [12,13] and metamaterials [14-16]. One recent application is to the design of a pressure
pulsation dampener made of a material with zero or negative Poisson’s ratio [17].
