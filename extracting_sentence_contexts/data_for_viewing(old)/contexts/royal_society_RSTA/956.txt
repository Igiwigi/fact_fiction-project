We can also reformulate these results in terms of normal forms.

Proposition 4.8. For H=y> — x? and w=f(x,y)dx A dy there is a real-analytic local coordinate
system u,v and germs a, B € R{H} such that

H=w-w and w=a(H)-du Adv + B(H)-vdu adv.

For positively oriented symplectic forms, the functions a(H) and B(H) are uniquely defined (the coordinates
u, v are not).

Let us now see what happens if ~ does not preserve H, but transforms it to a function of the
form h(H), h'(0) £0 (in fact h'(0) > 0). Let w, be positively oriented symplectic forms. We consider
necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a local diffeomorphism w such that y*@ =
wand w*H =h(H) with h’(0) > 0, i.e. a local symplectomorphism making the following diagram
commutative:

(R?,0) —“-+ (R?,0)

(R,0) —“s (R, 0).
We first note that any local diffeomorphism germ H+ h(H) at 0 with h’(0) > 0 is liftable. In
other words, we have the following.
Lemma 4.9. For any real-analytic map h: (IR,0) > (R,0) with h'(0) > 0, there exists y: (R*,0) >
(R2, 0) (local real-analytic diffeomorphism) such that
