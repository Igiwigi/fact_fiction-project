The angles measured are respectively 48, 48, 52, 56, 58, 59, 60, 63 and 78°, with a mean of
58°. Hence the equivalent phyllotaxis index of an average apex is about 3-25 — 0-75, or 2-5,
and on the apical surface the phyllotaxis is almost exactly midway between the 2:3 and
3:5 orthogonal systems. The fact that the stipular contact parastichies are expressed by
appreciably lower Fibonacci numbers, i.e. (1-4-2), indicates the considerable tangential
elongation of the primordia in this species. The result throws an interesting sidelight on certain diagrammatic representations of the
primordial arrangement on tht apical surface, reconstructed from careful observation of
the primordial sizes and contacts (Snow & Snow 1931, figures 9, 12, 13; and 1933, figures 4,
10, 17). In these diagrams the apical surface is represented in a cylindrical transformation.
