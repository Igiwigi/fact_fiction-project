extension has taken place, the elasticiby would be found to be less than when the mole-
cules have had sufficient time to finally settle themselves. Nor is it necessary that any
appreciable permanent contraction of the wire should attend this increase of elasticity,
as the mere change of arrangement of the molecules would suffice for the purpose.
To a similar cause is no doubt also due the increase of portative power which can be
produced in a permanent magnet by gradually increasing its load.

Another point to be noted is the sub-permanent set which is produced in all wires ;
bhis 8et is greater, according as the load permanently left on the wire is greater, and
also increases up to a certain limit with the time during which the stress producing
the set is applied : from this it follows that, the readings taken on loading a wire step
by step to a certain amount will be different from those taken at the same stages of
stress on unloading. This fact has already, I believe, heen noticed by TromsoN ; but
as I wish particularly to draw attention to it in the case of iron, I give the results of
one out, of several experiments made on iron and copper with a view of testing the

matter.
