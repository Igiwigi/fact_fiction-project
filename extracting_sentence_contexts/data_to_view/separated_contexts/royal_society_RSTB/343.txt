Tn our Experiments 10 and 11, the injection of strong salt solution distinctly lowers
the amount of saliva that could be obtained from the gland by stimulating the
chorda tympani and by pilocarpin, and, when injected in sufficient amount, prevented
all secretion from taking place, Hence, it seems to us probable that, if the injection
of salts can lead to an increase in the percentage of salts in the saliva above normal,
the amount of salts injected must be regulated with great nicety. Some REMARKS ON THE THEORY OF SECRETORY NERVES. We do not propose to discuss the question whether there is more than one kind
of secretory nerve ; but there are some facts in the foregoing experiments bearing on
the question which we cannot leave without mention. The most striking of these is the effect of bleeding in Experiment 8. The loss of
blood causes an increase in the percentage of organic substance in the saliva.* This
tends to show that with a given stimulus the percentage of organic substance
increases as the blood-flow through the gland decreases.
