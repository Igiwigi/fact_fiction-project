(mm.) length/breadth
L. sericata 8-225 3-806 2-17
C. chloropyga 9,319 4-165 2-24
C. albiceps 8-659 4-182 2-08 It is evident that C. albiceps requires the greatest amount of food—more than four times
as much as either of the other two species—in order to maintain its maximum puparial size. It does so, in fact, only under conditions where each larva has access to approximately 1-4 g.
of meat. The greatest response to an increase in the food supply takes place when the latter
is below the level at which 0-2 g. of meat is allowed per larva. Above this point, increasing
the food supply results in a comparatively slow response in the form of length increment.
