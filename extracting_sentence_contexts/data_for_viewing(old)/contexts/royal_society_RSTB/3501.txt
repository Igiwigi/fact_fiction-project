continued forwards over the tentacles to end upon the jaws. It is natural to expect
the forward continuation to have an origin similar to that of the main part of the
rod, and it is naturally in the neighbourhood of the tentacle spaces that we should
look for the two missing ambulacral pairs (vertebrae), and, further, the inner margin
of the rods continues, as already stated, the curve formed by the inner or radial
surface of a, and a That two vertebrae are represented in this remaining part of
the rod is suggested by the fact that the space intervening between the anterior end
of ds, and the oral extremity of the rod, is just twice the length of a; or a,; there are
two tentacle spaces and adambulacral pieces underlying the piece in question, so that
all the evidence there is goes to prove that the number of ambulacral and
adambulacral pieces is equal in this ancient Brittlestar. Evidence from actual
sutures is lacking, and also owing to the superposition of a, and a, upon the
adambulacrals, the useful actinal L-shaped ridge no longer acts as a guide.
