This stress tensor for
incompressible Navier-Stokes may be taken in the form

T=uu+pl—vVu, (1.2)

with p = P/p the kinematic pressure and v = n/p the kinematic viscosity. The stress tensor is the
ultimate vehicle of transmission of momentum to the wall, via its normal component

which produces both viscous drag due to the Newtonian wall stress and form drag due to the
pressure distribution, acting as sinks of momentum.

1We do not follow the fashion of referring to Onsager’s result on energy conservation for Hélder exponent h > 1/3 as the
‘Onsager conjecture’, and we shall instead refer to it as the ‘Onsager theorem’. Onsager did not state this result in his
published 1949 paper [5] as a conjecture, but instead he claimed that ‘it is possible to show that’ and he had, in fact, the
outlines of a rigorous proof [6,7]. The idea further suggested by Onsager [5] that energy should be dissipated for some Euler
solutions with Hélder exponent h < 1/3 is, however, legitimately referred to as the ‘Onsager conjecture’. For a review of the
important recent progress on that latter problem by ‘convex integration’ methods, see [8,9].
