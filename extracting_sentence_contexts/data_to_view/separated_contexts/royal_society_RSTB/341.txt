When a fairly large dose of pilocarpin is given
at the beginning of an experiment, a rapid secretion of saliva takes place and the
percentage of organic substance in it is high. Subsequent doses produce a less
and less rapid secretion of saliva; so that, although the percentage of organic sub-

shown by the fact that electrical stimulation of the chorda tympani has very little
