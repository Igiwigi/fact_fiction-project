full extent; but when partially filled with air, it measured
about 9 inches in circumference below its union with the tail,
and its greatest diameter, including the slender body to which
it pertained, was 4 inches. At about one inch below the last
point of its attachment with the body, the rectum was ob-
served to perforate the sac, the tenuity of which rendered the
course of that intestine, as indeed that of all the digestive
organs readily traced. They are apparently sustained beneath
the ribs (which latter appear very imperfect), by a membra-
nous expansion, as they are not affected in their position by
any inflation or emptying of the sac. That the sac itself
communicates with the pharynx, is sufficiently proved by the
fact, that if the blowpipe were further introduced, the diges-
tive organs were alone inflated, the sac undergoing no change
in its dimensions. The nearest point of analogy therefore to
this structure observable in the class Pisces, is seen among
the diodons and tetraodons, where a kind of ingluvies, or crop,
formed of a very thin and extensible membrane, adheres
closely to the peritonzzum throughout the whole extent of the

abdomen, by means of which their curious and rapid power of
inflation has long excited surprise, though we cannot in the

smooth Ophiognathus so satisfactorily account for its use, as
