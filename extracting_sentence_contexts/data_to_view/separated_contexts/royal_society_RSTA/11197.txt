Gaseous nebule . . . . 3 7 16 6
Stars of Division I. . . . 3 6 17 3. Thus it appears that the helium stars of Division I. and the gaseous nebulw are
subject to a similar law of distribution in relation to the galactic plane. All these facts afford grounds for accepting the conclusion that the helium stars of
Subdivision I. (Â«) are in the first stage of stellar development from the gaseous nebulie. Division I. has a second subdivision, viz., I. (b), which is also characterised by a few

special lines. These lines have been attributed to calcium, barium, and magnesium.
