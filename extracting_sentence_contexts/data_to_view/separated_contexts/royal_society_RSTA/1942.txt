Our preliminary experimental results further establish that diatoms’ buoyancy is not
only regulated by light or availability of nutrients but that it is also controlled by hydro-
mechanical stress. This strongly supports previous speculations that mechanically induced fast
intracellular responses, in the form of cytosolic Ca”+ spikes [26], are involved in downstream
mechanotransduction that translates into changes of cellular mass density. In fact, we have shown
significant changes (up to 50%) in the sinking speed of Thalassiosira pseudonanna cells after these
have been briefly exposed to shear level comparable to those naturally encountered in the sea. Although these reveal that diatoms are indeed able to modify buoyancy in response to external
flows, further experiments are needed in order to fully elucidate this interplay and to eventually
provide theoretical grounding for the observed active responses. Furthermore, we recall that we
expect buoyancy control to become even more important for larger species of diatoms, such
as Coscinodiscus walesii, for which the volume of the vacuole is larger, and larger variations in
undisturbed sinking speeds have already been observed [33,34].
