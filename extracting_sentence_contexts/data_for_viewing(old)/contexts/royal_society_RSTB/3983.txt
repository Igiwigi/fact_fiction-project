rather maternal than paternal. Spherechinus eggs, however, tended to give paternal
hybrids. Some genera seemed thus to have a greater potentiality for transmitting
their characteristics than others. One interesting point brought out was that when
Strongylocentrotus ¢ was crossed with Hehinus ? more numerous and larger larvae
were obtained than by direct fertilization. As a result of these experiments VERNon
concluded that the characteristics of the hybrid plutei depend on the relative ripeness
of the sexual products.

In the same year Drrescu (25) crossed Strongylocentrotus, Spherechinus, Echinus,
and Arbacia and obtained hybrid larvee with purely maternal characters, which he
suggested were inherited through the cytoplasm of the egg. He investigated the
rate of segmentation, the character of the blastula wall cells, the number of primitive
mesenchyme cells, the pigmentation, and the skeleton. He remarked on the fact that
some individuals of a species cross well, while others will not do so.

At this time, too, Drage (17) confirmed the possibility of Boveri's experiments by
cutting a single egg of a sea-urchin in two pieces and fertilizing both the nucleated
and the enucleated portions. Both of them he raised to the gastrula stage.

In 1900 Vernon (97) crossed Strongylocentrotus with Spherechimus and found that
the characters of the resulting hybrids varied with the season of the year at which the
experiments were made. In the spring the larvee resembled Strongylocentrotus, while
in the summer they resembled Spherechinus, In the latter case, however, none of
the larvee were of the pure Spharechinus type, as he had found ona previous oceasion.
He concluded that the seasonal fluctuations in “ prepotency ’
