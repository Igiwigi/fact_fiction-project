be 60? 46'; the obtuse ones 119* 14/; and the solid angle of the
summit 165*. The crystal I have just described, would then be
nothing more than the prismatic modification, combined with
that which occasions this rhomboid ; at both extremities of which,
one of the faces of each of the obtuse triedral pyramids, be-
longing to-the new rhomboid, would have acquired (in a con-
trary direction with respect to its extremities) such an increase
as would cause the other faces to disappear. 'These two faces,
having now become the terminal ones of the hexaedral prism,
would in fact make, with those edges of the prism on which
they would incline, angles of 100? and' 809. This very obtuse
rhomboid would be the result of a decrease analogous to
the two preceding ones, : but still more rapid. Many pyra-
midal crystals of this kind of corundum, present such inclined
terminal faces; but with a difference, in the measure of their
angles, conformable to_ the inclination of the edges of. the
pyramids.

Seventh Modification, The primitive rhomboid of this sub-
stance.also undergoes sometimes, though very rarely, a decrease
at those acute angles. which rest upon the base.; and this de-
crease is such, that it replaces each. of the solid angles of this
