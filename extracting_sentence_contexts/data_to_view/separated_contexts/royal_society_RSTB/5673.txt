But a more precise hypothesis is that it arises in the
first space that becomes both wide enough and distant enough from the growing-point. This is adopted as the working hypothesis.

6. The increase in angle between the next two primordia after the isolated primordium,
is partly the direct result of the shift of the growing-point towards the gap between
them, and is partly due to the fact that the second primordium is displaced, relatively
to the primordia below it, in the direction of the wound.

7. It is shown to be in accordance with expectation that the increase in this angle
is greater after isolation of I, than of P,. The displacement of the second primordium
is explained, on the working hypothesis, as due to three different factors working
together, and the explanation is supported by various observations.
