In this form the method is applicable to
the fitting of populations involving any number of variates, and equally to discontinuous
as to continuous distributions. In order to make clear the distinction between this method and that of BayEs, we
will apply it to the same type of problem as that which Bayes discussed, in the hope
of making clear exactly of what kind 1s the information which a sample is capable of
supplying. This question naturally first arose, not with respect to populations distri-
buted in frequency curves and surfaces, but with respect to a population regarded as
divided into two classes only, in fact in problems of probability. A certain proportion,
p, of an infinite population is supposed to be of a certain kind, e.g., “ successes,” the
remainder are then “ failures.” A sample of » is taken and found to contain x successes
and y failures.
