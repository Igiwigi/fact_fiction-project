Marruew has used the relative height of the teeth and the progressive evolution of
hypsodontism as important characters in the rhinoceroses, and quotes in his diagram,
fig. 1, four stages: brachydont, sub-brachydont,} hypsodont, and sub-hypsodont. There is no explanation, in the way of comparative measurement or otherwise, of
what constitutes the difference, for example, between the terms sub-brachydont and
sub-hypsodont beyond the fact that certain species are placed in one or other of the
divisions. To form some basis on which to work a certain number of forms are here illustrated,
figs. 2, 3, 4.
