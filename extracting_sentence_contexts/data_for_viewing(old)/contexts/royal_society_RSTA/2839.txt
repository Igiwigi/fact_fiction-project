d,h(s,s') = — cosy’,
where 0; denotes the derivative with respect to the ith variable (i= 1,2).
— If we lift Bg to the universal cover of Ay and introduce new coordinates (x,y) =
(s,— cosy) € R x (—1,1), then the billiard map becomes a monotone twist map with h
as generating function and it preserves the area form dx A dy [2-4].

Remark 2.3. It follows from (2.1), {(s;, 9j)}iez is an orbit of Bg if and only if {s;}jez is a ‘critical
configuration’ for the action functional

in the usual sense of statistical mechanics; in fact, while this latter sum is infinite, its derivatives
are well defined:

These critical configurations are not necessarily (global) minima. One could be wondering
whether (global) minima exist and if they have special dynamical features. Aubry-Mather theory—
developed independently by Serge Aubry and John Mather at the beginning of the 1980s—focuses
exactly on these questions. More specifically, it is concerned with the study of orbits that are
global minimizers of the action-functional, i.e. every finite segment minimizes the action functional
