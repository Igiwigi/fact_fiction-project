But when the current was stopped large effects (larger than those when
the current was flowing) were produced by putting on and taking off the weights ; and
these effects were always of the same Kind, whichever had been the direction of the
current. 195. I have not yet been able to explain these effects by terrestrial magnetic force®*,
nor to even guess any other possible cause ; and have in fact, since the 23rd of December
last, been exceedingly perplexed by seeming anomalies which the various soft-iron wires
tried have presented, commencing that day with a reversal of the electromagnetic effect
of the © off ” and © on” which the first of the wires experimented on showed after the
magnetizing current had been made for the first time and broken, and a weight of 14 1bs. put on and off several times had first shaken out. nearly one third of the residual mag-
netism, and then given alternate augmentation by © on ” and diminution by © off” of the
magnetism that remained.
