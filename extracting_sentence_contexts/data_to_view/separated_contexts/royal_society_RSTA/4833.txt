Moreover, there are also many ways to employ direct product ensembles, independent copies
of the cell or system, by using multiple independent copies of (X,S) for any semigroup S acting
faithfully on a set X. In particular, this is true when X C Q and S = (X)per divides S(A), with
Sa SNAG. A useful fact via ‘computing in parallel’ is related to the interpretation of groups
in Gibbs’s viewpoint on ensembles. For any faithful permutation group (X,G), the right regular

This restriction might be removable also if the sequences produced would vary in time in response to state that changes
more quickly, but details of conditions that make this possible have not been characterized yet.

31F must separate points of X up to cosets and contain enough constants up to cosets: for the first, distinct points should map
to different cosets of N and, for the second, there must exist functions approximating constants for generators of G, i.e. values
must be in the same coset of G/N rather than strictly constant.


representation (G, G) with action gi - g = gig can be realized as a substructure of the direct product
of X-many copies of (X,G). That is, |X| instances of a regulatory network within a cell, or |X|
instances of the cell, allow one to embed (G,G) into the ensemble: let X = {x1,...,Xm} denote
the m distinct elements of X, then a state g; € G can be uniquely encoded as (x1 - 81,...,%m * 81)
as the action is faithful.
