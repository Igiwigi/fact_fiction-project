J. H. ASHWORTH ON THE GIANT NERVE CELLS AND

a diameter of 55 to 85 p, of the fourth 35 to 60, of the fifth 20 to 40», while the
cells in the sixth segment of the largest specimen and the secondary cells in the
first and second segments of the same specimen are 20 to 27 » in diameter. The giant cells of Aglawrides apparently enlarge rapidly soon after they are
differentiated, for some of them are large even in young worms—the largest giant
cells of a specimen 35 mm. long have a mean diameter of 80 —but they subsequently
grow only slowly and for a comparatively short time; they have, in fact, already
almost attained their maximum size (their mean diameter being about 90) when
the worm is about 14 em. long. Henceforward the size of the giant cells remains
practically unchanged: the two largest cells of a specimen 315 mm.
