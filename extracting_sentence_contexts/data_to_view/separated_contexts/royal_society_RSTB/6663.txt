It is therefore most suggestive of some relationship
between the early molluscan faunas of Lake Rudolf and that of the western rift valley. In conclusion I would remark that nowhere have any of the foregoing three species

important is the fact that where they are found in a deposit, there is so far no record of
their occurring with any species of the later nilotic fauna which now occupies the lake
basin. APPENDIX B
