These express the second functions; the first taken relative
to x, the other relative to y. But besides these two there is
another, which arises from taking the second function simul-
taneous]y relative to x, and y; it is {(v zy),Ã¾ (29) pr This
ought not to be written 4** (x, y) for it is not the second
function first taken relative to z and then to y, nor is it the
converse of this. In fact, the notation is defective ; s0me
method is wanting of indicating the order in which the suc-
cessive Substitutions are made. I $hall for the present lay
aside the consideration of functional equations, involving more
than one variable. Those of the first order have long been known, but the
method in which I have treated them is, I believe, entirely
new.
