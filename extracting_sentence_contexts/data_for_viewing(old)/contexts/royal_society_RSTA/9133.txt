so that we obtain for @ and y precisely equations (7.544) and (7.551), a fact which is
not surprising yet hardly obvious, because in § 7.5 we were dealing with a different
correspondence.

Analogues to Theorems XXX and XXXI are immediately available :

TurorEeM XL (K) :—In order that the motion of a holonomic conservative system with
three degrees of freedom may be stable in the kinematico-statical sense, it is necessary and
sufficient that the values of 8 and y as solutions of the differential equations (7.544) and
(7.551) should be permanently small, for arbitrary values of the infinitesimal constant th.
