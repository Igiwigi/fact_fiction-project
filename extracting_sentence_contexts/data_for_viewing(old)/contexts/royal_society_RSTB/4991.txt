the Hydropteridean affinities of Sagenopteris.

They are described} as “ capsules, dorsiventral, flattened from the sides, oblong or
bean-shaped, borne by pedicels, attached to one end of the capsule. Hach lateral half
traversed by ridges, parallel or diverging from the median portion of the distal edge.”
There is little evidence of their connection with Sagenopteris apart from association, and
in this respect no statistical information is given.

The first point which arises in considering these structures concerns their identificatior
as sporocarps. External similarity is certainly strong, but on maceration Hate failed
to extract either micro- or megaspore-membranes. Experience shows that when spores
are present, even in a fairly young condition, they can generally be extracted by macera-
tion, and the fact that Prof. Hate did not find traces of any is a serious difficulty to our
regarding these structures as sporocarps. He did, however, find traces of an “ inner
membrane,” as well as obtaining the cuticle of the outer wall, and states that “ it is not
certain that this layer represents a real epidermis, as the cuticle—though of a considerable
thickness—is too disintegrated to give a clear idea of its structure.’ No figures of this
inner cuticle layer are given, and here, again, it is possible that it represents fragments of
one or more megaspore membranes. When | first commenced the examination of
Gristhorpia by maceration, I considered that the pieces of megaspore membrane which I
obtained represented such an inner membrane as Hatxe describes. It was only after
the careful examination of a number of specimens that the entire megaspore membranes
were obtained more or less intact, consequently it would be valuable for these fruits
to be re-examined.
