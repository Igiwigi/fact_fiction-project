turn, within two rich and well-characterized datasets of fossil and extant
species (penguins and canids). We find that the estimation accuracy of
fossil ages is generally high with credible intervals seldom excluding the
true age and median relative error in the two datasets of 5.7% and 13.2%,

Subject Areas: In fact, in the two datasets we analyse, the phylogenetic estimate of fossil age

is on average less than 2 Myr from the mid-point age of the geological strata
from which it was excavated. The high level of internal consistency found in
our analyses suggests that the Bayesian statistical model employed is an
adequate fit for both the geological and morphological data, and provides
Keywords: evidence from real data that the framework used can accurately model
the evolution of discrete morphological traits coded from fossil and
extant taxa. We anticipate that this approach will have diverse applications
beyond divergence time dating, including dating fossils that are temporally
unconstrained, testing of the ‘morphological clock’, and for uncovering
potential model misspecification and/or data errors when controversial
