the thyroid cartilage is given by EpGeworrs (1916). While there is universal agree-
ment that in Monotremes and Marsupials the thyroid cartilages are made up of the
skeletal elements of the 4th and 5th visceral (= 2nd and 8rd branchial) arches, there
is a divergence of opinion concerning the placental mammals. The view that the placental
thyroid cartilages contain elements representing the 4th and 5th visceral arches is
held by Kantius (1897) and Grosser (1912) from studies on man, whilst the view that
they are formed from derivatives of the 4th visceral arch only is held by Sour and
Barpipr (1907) in regard to man, and by Epceworrn (1916) working on the pig.
The study of the rabbit, described in this paper, is definitely in favour of the former
view, since each thyroid cartilage at stages 11 and 12 possesses two wings extending
towards the middle line ventral to the trachea. It seems therefore that EpGEwortuâ€™s
explanation of the fact that the recurrent laryngeal nerve enters the larynx ventral
to the articulation of the thyroid and cricoid cartilages in Monotremes and Marsupials,
and dorsal to it in placental mammals, by supposing the articulations to be not homo-
logous, is deprived of its evidence.

A median copula between the ventral ends of the wings of the thyroid cartilages
has been found in man by Nicuonas (1894), Kauurus (1897), Sourm and Barprer
(1907), and Frazer (1910) ; in the pig by EpGeworru (1916), who also found it among
Marsupials in Dasyurus ; and in Monotremes by Dunots (1886). It would seem that
in the rabbit this copula is represented by the paired cartilages, situated between the
posterior wings of the thyroid cartilages, to which the term hypothyroid cartilages
has been applied.
