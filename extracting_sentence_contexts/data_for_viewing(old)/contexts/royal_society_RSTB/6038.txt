occurrence here and there at the free surface of the trophoblast of light staining cells,
ovalish to irregular in form. They occur singly or two or three may lie in proximity.
The ovalish cells are often seen to be superimposed each on a basally situated cell of
roughly corresponding size (Pl. 2, fig. 24), and their nuclei frequently exhibit an
early phase of mitosis (fig. 25). Careful study of these cells shows that the division is
rarely if ever completed and that they eventually assume an irregular form and undergo
degeneration, all stages of which are to be met with in our preparations (figs. 26 and 27).


J. P. HILL ON THE DEVELOPMENTAL HISTORY OF THE PRIMATES. 65

It might be held that these cells are the last remnants of former proliferative activity
on the part of the trophoblast, but the fact that they appear to be produced by the
division of a parent trophoblast cell tangentially to the surface, instead of radially
thereto, as is normal, suggests that they are to be regarded simply as the products of
accidental deviations from the normal mitotic plane.

Apart from these cells, we have not observed in the development of the placenta of
Loris any structural feature which in the slightest degree suggests its derivation from a
more complicated type.

Turning to the opposite view that the Lemuroid placenta is essentially primitive,
what evidence, apart from theoretical considerations, can we adduce in its support ?

Earlier in this lecture (ante, p. 60) we have expressed our conviction that certain
