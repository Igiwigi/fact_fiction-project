While the murine naive pluripotent state per se and its
sub-states are subjected to intense investigation, the human
naive state has yet to be identified. It is currently being
hunted and although several groups have reported to have
captured the human naive pluripotent state [127-129],
these different groups do not use the same cell culture con-
ditions. This might or might not reflect the plasticity of the
supposedly generated naive PSCs.

While at first glance it appeared that species differences
account for the different characteristics of murine and
human ESCs, which in fact was the difference between the
naive and the primed state, it now appears puzzling why
murine and supposedly human naive PSCs are very different
in their culture condition requirements bearing in mind the
astonishing similarity of murine and human primed PSCs.
Therefore, it might be justified to expect that human naive
stem cells resemble murine naive stem cells very closely,
and hence the right culture conditions for robust human
naive (ground) state derivation and maintenance have not
been found yet. For instance, the murine naive ground state
PSCs require 2i-Lif, which results in robust culture across lab-
oratories. Also, new ESCs can be derived by the isolation of
the ICM in this condition. So far, however, the culture con-
