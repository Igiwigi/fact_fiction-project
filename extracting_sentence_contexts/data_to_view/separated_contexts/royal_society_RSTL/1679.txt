6. The alkaline s0lutions may be evaporated nearly to dry-
ness without Iosing their red colours; during the evaporation
of the ammoniacal solution, the alkali flies off, and a brown+
red s0lution of the colouring matter in water remains. P2


108 Mr, W. Braxpe's Chemical Researches on the Blood,

Having ascertained the above facts respecting the colouring
principle of the blood, I next proceeded to examine how far
it was susceptible of entering into those combinations which
are peculiar to other varieties of colouring matter. These experiments I shall detail in the order in which they
were made,

1. Some pure alumine was added to a concentrated aqueous
solution of the colouring matter of the blood, and after twenty-
four hours the mixture, which had" been frequently agitated
during that period, was poured upon a filter, and the residuum
washed with hot distilled water.
