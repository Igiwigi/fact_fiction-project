His method of
dealing with these terms does certainly give a complete, though only formal, solution. Unfortunately the results involve series of terms each of which is a complicated Hankel
function, and it is extremely difficult to check results by numerical data. We shall,
however, follow his methods and obtain results slightly more general than his, and
establish only qualitative agreement with experimental facts. [13] The principle of DE Waarn’s method.—For the sake of generality we shall not
