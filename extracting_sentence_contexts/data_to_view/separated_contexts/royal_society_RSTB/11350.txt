Hence, correlations within monozygotic tact value relative to pathogen costs [4,5]. These same

twin pairs can be compared with correlations within learning processes need not shape the intensity of disgust


responses to such objects, though. And, of course, the fact
that half of the variance in disgust sensitivity in the sample
of Finnish twins was accounted for by unshared environ-
mental factors suggests that environmental factors—even if
they are not social learning—strongly shape disgust sensi-
tivity. But what are these factors? We turn to another
popular hypothesis—that disgust sensitivity is calibrated to
infectious disease, either experienced personally or present
in the broader ecology—in the next section.
