In the month of August, however, the atmosphere appeared in 80 vacillating and
disturbed a state, that the only tide which turned at the normal hour was the 10 a.m.
maximum tide. The means of the hourly readings on four days in each month,
corrected for moisture, give a mean curve of pressure in each month which nearly
corresponds with the curve of pressure of the daily readings of the barometer cor-
rected for temperature only. The maximum pressure with both corrections occurs
in December, but the minimum occurs in June corrected for temperature and in July
with both corrections. The whole of the facts connected with the meteorology of
Aden of which I have made use, are from observations taken by Sergeant Moyss,
with excellent instruments, and Dr. Butsr is now passing the observations through
the press.

These facts, which could be very greatly multiplied, have been somewhat dwelt
upon, with a view to a right understanding of HumBoLprT's observations in his Cosmos*,
