This is, in a nutshell, the beautiful metaphor provided by nature for the BEH mechanism.

3. The problem of mass in the standard model

In the electroweak theory of Glashow, Weinberg and Salam, we have four agents transmitting
forces, the vector bosons W+,W~,Z and the photon field y. Their description is in terms of a
gauge theory with group SU(2) x U(1), and it is not consistent to add masses by hand.

In this gauge group, we have four quantum numbers similar to electric charge: three for weak
isospin (the SU(2) part) and one for weak hypercharge (the U(1) part). It is a remarkable fact about
the weak interactions (as obtained by numerous experiments), that the left- and right-handed
components of quarks and leptons couple differently to the force fields. This fact protects them
from acquiring mass if we try to use the analogy with how we represent the mass of the electron
in quantum electrodynamics (QED). Adding by hand a mass term in the SM again violates gauge
invariance and renders the theory inconsistent.

The key to SSB in the SM it to introduce two complex scalar field that form a doublet with
respect to weak isospin:

(() ||, 01, 62, 63. (3.1)

In analogy with §2, we can describe the scalar doublet in terms of a common modulus |H P=
|H*|? + |H°/? and three angles. Three of the charges develop condensates, and only one, electric
