Although ACO-
OFDM provides the lowest SNR cost at low spectral efficiencies, its SNR cost rapidly increases
with spectral efficiency. This is because ACO-OFDM requires a constellation size of m-squared
compared with schemes that do not have a loss of half the subcarriers, e.g. 1024 constellation
points rather than 32 for schemes with full spectral efficiency. This fact makes layered schemes
very attractive for high spectral efficiencies because the extra data are carried by additional layers
rather than by increasing 1; however, layered schemes have their own cost per layer, because
every layer contributes to the mean optical power, so for a constant optical power, each layer
must be allocated less power as the number of layers is increased. For ease of comparisons, in figure 6, none of the schemes in the figure have diversity combining
nor noise cancellation as applied to layered systems by Wang et al. [49] and later by Mohammed
et al. [38], then Wang et al. [50] using soft successive interference cancellation. By taking QPSK
ACO-OFDM as the reference for SNR cost, Mohammed ef al.â€™s fig. 5 can be used by subtracting
approximately 5 dB from their optical energy per bit, Ep(opt)/No, to obtain the electrical SNR cost
of figure 6.
