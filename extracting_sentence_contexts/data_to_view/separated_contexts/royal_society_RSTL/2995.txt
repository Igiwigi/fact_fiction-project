Egyptian mummies. 299

That $uch are the facts, I appeal to the state of the bones of
the ilium, and of the uterus with its appendages, for proof,

The first exhibit that peculiar degree of thinning in the cen-
tre of their osseous plates which has been noticed in women
by Professor CHavssER and others, in the course of a great
number of observations, as an indication of their having borne
children, and of their having passed the fortieth year. This
thinning of the bones, in the particular part just mentioned,
has never been observed under forty years of age, and be-
comes gradually greater until fifty-five, when it has reached
its maximum, however longer the woman may continue to
live. In my mummy it will be seen, on looking at the pel-
vis, or at Plate XX.
