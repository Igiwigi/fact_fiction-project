Crossings along 13,, (when s = L and 4 € [—A.9,0]) correspond to eigenvalues of the operator
Hy defined in (1.3), hence Mor(H_) equals the number of crossings on 13,,, counting multiplicities.
On the other hand, a local computation shows that all crossings along I, have the same sign
(lemma 3.3). This important monotonicity property implies that |Mas(13,,,D))| is equal to the
total number of crossings, and hence is equal to the Morse index of Hy.

Finally, Mas(I2,,D) is the Maslov index of the boundary value problem (1.3) with 4 =0.
Another local computation shows that all crossings along [1 have the same sign (lemma 3.4).
This means, in particular, that Mas(I>,,D) is equal to the number of crossings along I>, counted
with multiplicity.

Combining the above results with the fact that Mas(J7,,D) vanishes, we arrive at the desired
formula

Mor(H_) = # crossings, with multiplicity, in (—0o, L) (1.9)

relating the Maslov index of the boundary value problem and the Morse index of the
corresponding differential operator. This result is summarized in theorem 3.1. We then show in
theorem 4.1 that the Maslov index of I), is independent of L for all L large enough, and thus can
be viewed as the Maslov index for (1.1) posed on the whole line.

The paper is organized as follows. After a brief introduction to the Maslov index, in §2, we
introduce an appropriate symplectic structure and relate the crossings of the path @;(Y;) to the
eigenvalues of differential operators. In §3, we prove monotonicity of the crossings and provide
