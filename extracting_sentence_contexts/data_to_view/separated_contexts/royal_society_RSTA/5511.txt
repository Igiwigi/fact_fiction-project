But it is
startling to find a referee expressing the opinion that “the paper is nothing but
nonsense, unfit even for reading before the Society.” Another remarks “that the
whole investigation is confessedly founded on a principle entirely hypothetical, from
which it is the object to deduce » mathematical representation of the phenomena
of elastic media. It exhibits much skill and many remarkable accordances with the

synthetical reasoning upon which

general facts, as well as numerical values furnished by observation. . . . The
original principle itself involves an assumption which seems to me very difficult to
admit, and by no means a satisfactory basis for a mathematical theory, viz., that the
elasticity of a medium is to be measured by supposing its molecules in vertical motion,
and making a succession of impacts against an elastic gravitating plane.” These
remarks are not here quoted with the idea of reflecting upon the judgment of the
referee, who was one of the best qualified authorities of the day, and evidently
devoted to a most difficult task his careful attention; but rather with the view of
throwing light upon the attitude then assumed by men of science in regard to this
question, and in order to point a moral.
