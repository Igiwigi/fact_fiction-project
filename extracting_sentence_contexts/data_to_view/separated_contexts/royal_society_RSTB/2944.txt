When Binnpy, in 1866, first described his newly-discovered Dadoaylon Oldhamium,

mind of its discoverer. “It evidently belonged,” he says, ‘‘to the genus Pinites of
WirHam, since changed by Enpticner and Bronentart into Dadowylon.” *
Wittramson’s full investigation of the structure of the stem, published in 1873,t

Dadoxylon lumber-room ; WiuutAMson had, in fact, already separated it in 1869,
under the generic name Dictyorylon.{ Speaking of Lyginodendron Oldhamium,
