Indeed,
a paradigmatic example is provided by [Ca(formamide)}*+ clusters whose collision-induced :
dissociation (CID) was studied by mass spectrometry coupled with static quantum chemistry [=
calculations by Eizaguirre et al. [15]. In such study, the reactivity was elucidated by carrying out a :s
rather complete survey of the topology of the corresponding potential energy surface (PES). This :
system constitutes, however, a prime example of the incomplete picture that the topology of the Dk
PES offers for the rationalization of the observed reactivity. :

As a matter of fact, the neutral loss of formamide yielding Ca?+ is the most energetically 14
demanding reaction, over all the other possible products. This simple fact does not allow ae
one to explain the most obvious experimental outcome clearly showing that the dominant se
reactive channel is that associated precisely with loss of formamide, yielding Ca?+. This [3
apparent contradiction between the topology of the PES and experimental evidence moved us to .
re-explore the unimolecular reactivity of [Ca(formamide)]*+ ion through a deep investigation of
its dynamics on the reactive PES in terms of kinetics [16] and dynamics approaches [17,18].
