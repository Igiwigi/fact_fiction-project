fissure. On separating its lips, the usual tri-radiate secondary sulcus is seen on the
anterior wall.

Suleus retrocentralis nferior.—This is a tri-radiate suleus subdividing the inferior
parietal lobule. Its posterior extremity coincides with the posterior end of the
fissure of Sylvius by reason of an early fusion of the superior temporal and supra-
marginal gyri.

Sulcus subcentralis posterior,—This is present as a short unbranched sulcus, cutting
the upper margin of the Sylvian fissure,

Sulcus Sylvii.itn general the fissure of Sylvius does not at first sight appear
abnormal, but, as a matter of fact, it is notably shortened posteriorly by the
annectation just mentioned.

(a) Ramus horizontalis anterior,—This arises by a common stem with the ramus
ascendens, and is a short cleft separating the frontal operculum from the orbital
lobe.

(b) Ramus anterior ascendens.—This, the formerly termed anterior limb of the
fissure, is also short, and runs vertically upwards, parallel to and only 8 mm.
separated from the sulcus preecentralis inferior.

(c) Ramus posterior ascendens et descendens.—This important part of the fissure
barely occupies 40 (39°3) per cent. of the total length of the hemisphere owing to
