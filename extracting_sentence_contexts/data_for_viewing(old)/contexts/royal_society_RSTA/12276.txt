: containing H,SO,. A tube containing Ba(HO), was fixed between the drying bottles
@ and the calorimeter, as we thought it just possible that, otherwise, sufficient H,SO,
"Z vapour might pass into the chamber to produce some action on the steel surfaces.
a When the apparatus was fixed together the temperature of the tank was raised to
s about 40° C.; the air was then exhausted down to about 16 millims. by the water
2 pump, dry air was passed in slowly, and this process was repeated several times.
i = Finally the pressure was reduced as far as possible by the water pump (to about 12
z to 14 millims.), and the Sprengel and Geissler brought into play.
‘2 It took about 100 double strokes with these pumps to bring the pressure down to
% 1 millim., so the labour involved was great, and want of time alone prevented our
3 reducing the pressure further than we did. By increasing the number of the platinum
S tubes we hope to be able in future to work with much better vacua.
& The absence of leakage is indicated by the fact that the lapse of a week made no
- perceptible difference in the reading of the McLeod gauge, although a change of ‘01
& millim. could have been easily detected.
S It was long before this degree of perfection was attained, for the difficulty of
& ascertaining the position of a slight leakage, in such a circuit, was very great, and
E many weary hours were expended in leak hunting and in consequent taking to pieces
© and putting together again the various portions of the apparatus.
