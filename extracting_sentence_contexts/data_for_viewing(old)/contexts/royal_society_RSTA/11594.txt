photographs clearer, and from 19 onward a good deal of milk (about one part of milk
to three of water). In this splash the crater rises to a greater height and closes
completely over the central hollow, opening again, however, very shortly afterwards
to make way for the column that rises from the base, and whose subsidence produces
“cakes” as before. In Photograph 18 the bubble has apparently not yet burst
before its top is struck by the column rising inside. Sub-group A consists of special

studies showing the bubble opening quite centrally round the emergent column, and
the fact that the base of this does not photograph shows how completely the original
milk drop is collected at the top of the column. Sub-group B illustrates what
happens when, as in Photograph 18, the top of the bubble is struck by the column
and burst at one side. Under the influence of the surface tension, rotundity of form
is soon regained, and by the time the stage of Photograph 21 is reached all traces of
previous irregularities have disappeared.

Examination with a lens of Photographs 3, 4, and 5 shows how the drop, on first
entering, punches a very sheer-walled hole.* From the fact that these early stages
photograph so well as compared (see next series) with corresponding stages when the
drop is of water and the liquid is milk, we infer that the first liquid thrown up is
milk drawn from the fringe of the drop itself. It must be remembered that owing to
the closeness of the camera, front and back parts of the crater cannot be quite in
