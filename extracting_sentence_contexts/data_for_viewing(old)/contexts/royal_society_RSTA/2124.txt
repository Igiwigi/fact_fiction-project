form by cutting off unessential parts would be extremely important to the understanding of
nonlinear dynamical systems. We will call such work of purification dynamical reduction or simply
reduction.

It seems widely accepted today that the concept of reduction has worked as a strong
motivating force for the advancement of nonlinear science over the past half-century. As a
remarkable fact, reduction provides, besides the explanation of how this or that dynamical
behaviour observed occurs, a powerful tool for predicting utterly new types of behaviour whose
existence in nature has never been imagined before. Since the result of reduction often takes a
universal form, the predicted dynamics is also expected to appear universally. The universal form
of the reduced evolution equation also implies that seemingly unrelated phenomena occurring
in systems of completely different physical constitution may have something in common at a
deeper mathematical level. Accumulation of such findings, each of which may be a small one,
may ultimately lead to our refreshed view of nature.

Reduction is generally practicable when the dynamics of largely separated time scales coexist
in the system of concern, that is, when dynamical variables of fast motion and those of much
slower motion are coupled. Traditionally, two basic ideas have been known for the reduction of
the dynamics of this type of system. One is the idea of the so-called adiabatic elimination and the
