We may now consider the calculation of the freezing points of more concentrated
solutions where correction factors have to be introduced. In these copper-rich and
silver-rich alloys we consider that the equilibrium between the liquid and solid phases
is the result of two distinct factors, the one electronic and the other atomic. We suggest.
further, that, when proceeding along the same horizontal row of the periodic table,
i.e., in a series such as copper-zine, copper-gallium, and copper-germanium, the atoms,
or more properly the ions, are so similar in structure that, to a first approximation,
the atomic factor is negligible, and the equilibrium is the result of the electronic factor
alone. This suggestion that neighbouring atoms are almost indistinguishable or
identical in the B sub-groups (the A sub-groups behave quite differently), is supported
by many facts, such as the readiness with which one atom will replace the other in
certain crystal structures, the almost constant atomic diameters{ in the crystals of the
elements, etc. From this point of view the simple valency laws for the freezing point
curves are the result of the electronic factor, and the deviations in more concentrated
solutions ave due to the increasing effect of the atomic factor. The probability of such an
explanation is greatly strengthened by the fact that, as we show in the next section,

+ The rate of cooling used was 1° in 2-5 seconds.

+ In passing from copper to germanium the extreme variation in atomic diameter is from 2-67A to 2-44 A.
In the A group elements of the same period the atomic diameters from potassium to titanium vary from
