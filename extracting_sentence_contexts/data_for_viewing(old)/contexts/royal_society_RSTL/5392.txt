At thirty minutes, that is to say, as 800n as the water was added, the chamber was
in three eggs largely developed, as much as it would have been in an hour in eggs
only moderately supplied with spermatozoa, though in the fourth egg the degree was
not quite s0 great. From eight to twelve spermatozoa were detected in each chamber,
and some motionless in the fluid ; others on the vitelline membrane had their serpen-
tine movements; and others were projecting from the membrane motionless, as if
their force had been expended before they could effect an entrance.

This last experiment seems to favour my view, that the changes in the yelk are

hastened by excess of the fecundating fluid.
. From the facts stated above, and before detailed in my former papers, the con-
clusion seems to be arrived at, that the fructifying of the egg depends on the force or
power residing in the sperm body to make its way through the thick coverings of the
yelk; and that, this being the case, an explanation will be afforded of the failure of
the fluid to occasion fecundation when those bodies are deficient in number or well-
being, or are deprived of the power of moving: and at the same time the penetrating
power may afford a clue to the inability of filtering paper, even when it is twice or
thrice folded, to stop their progress through it.

The action of the spermatozoon is influenced by the temperature of the air, and by
mechanical impediments to its passage into the egg.

With respect to temperature, I have frequently referred to its influence in expe-
