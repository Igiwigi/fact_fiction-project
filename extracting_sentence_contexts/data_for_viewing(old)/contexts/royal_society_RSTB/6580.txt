evidence now available tends to cast doubt upon that interpretation. It remains to
enquire whether there is any other Craniate organ to which the diverticulum might
be compared.

The present writer has recently directed attention to MAsKELLâ€™s (1930) discovery
in two Australian ammocoetes of intestinal diverticula which grow forwards from the
anterior end of the intestine, at the point at which the oesophagus passes into it;
two diverticula occur in Geotria and one in Mordacia. These diverticula contain pre-
sumed secretory cells with granular inclusions and single large nucleoli, and it has
been shown (BARRINGTON 1936) that an accumulation of similar cells at the anterior
end of the intestine in the ammocoete of Lampetra planeri (in which no diverticula
occur) is the seat of the production of a proteolytic enzyme of the tryptic type. Now
it is impossible to ignore certain resemblances between these conditions and the facts
recorded above for Amphioxus, for in the latter there is an intestinal diverticulum which
grows forward from the point of junction of the oesophagus and the intestine (mid-gut),
which contains secretory cells with granular inclusions and single large nucleoli, and
from which digestive enzymes, including a protease of a tryptic type, can be extracted.
That the cells in question are comparable in the two forms seems reasonably clear;
in Amphioxus, however, they occur also in the mid-gut, cells of a similar appearance
being conspicuous in the hind-gut as well. This scattered distribution makes it
impossible to correlate them with the production of the protease as clearly as in the
ammocoete where they are very localized, although the proteolytic activity of the
mid-gut and hind-gut extracts would be in agreement with that correlation.

It is possible to regard the granular cells in the ammocoete as representing zymogen
