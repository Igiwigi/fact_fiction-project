to find ¢ to satisfy the following conditions:

(i) ¢ is continuous with continuous first derivatives everywhere except along the positive
x-axis.

(ii) ¢ vanishes at y = 00.

(iii) Along the x-axis ¢ takes certain prescribed values, given by ¢ = f(x) say, whether
we approach the x-axis from above or below.

There are, in fact, four problems of this type which can be solved, the solutions of which
will be useful in the sequel. They are given by variation of the condition (iii). Thus

(a) $+f(x) as y>0 from above or below.

(b) $->4+f(x) as y>0 from above,
— f(x) as y>0 from below.

(c) (“°) g(x) as y>0 from above or below.
