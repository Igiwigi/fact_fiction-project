Her present aspect is thus in strict accordance
with the reults of the purely theoretical investigation. It would perhaps be premature to undertake a complete review of the planetary
system, 80 as to 8ee how far the ideas here developed accord with it. Although many
facts which could be adduced seem favourable to their acceptance, I will only refer
to two. The atellites of Mars appear to me a most remarkable confirmation of these
views, Their extreme minuteness has prevented them from being snhbject to any per-
ceptible tidal reaction, Jusb as the minuteness of the earth compared with the gun has
prevented the earth's orbit from being perceptibly influenced (se Section 19); they thus
remain as a standing memorial of the primitive periodic time of Mars round his axis. Mars, on the other hand, has been Subjected to solar tidal friction.
