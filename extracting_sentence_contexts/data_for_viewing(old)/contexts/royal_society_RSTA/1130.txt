where here we have integrated by parts in the linear term and by |Vu|* we mean La lojujl*.
Integrating by parts the nonlinear and pressure terms vanish!

[te /V)ul-u= I. uj (juju; = — [,@apim? + ujuj(9juj) = — I. ujuj(djui)
(since u =0 on 02 and djuj = V -u=0) and
| u-Vp =| ujdjp = -| (djuj)p = -| (V-u)p=0 (4.1)

(again using the fact that u is divergence free and zero on the boundary).

1n these calculations, we use the Einstein summation convention and sum over repeated indices. Note that very similar
manipulations show that [ o[(w- V)u] -v =— J ol(u- Vv] - w whenever w is divergence free and u or v are zero on 32.
