It is from this hypothetical fish that I believe the Amphibia to have arisen. The
evidence on which this view is founded is most conveniently presented by a comparison
of the structures of the skeleton, of the body form and movements, and of the mode
of life, in an Osteolepid and an Embolomerous amphibian. In order to secure the
materials for such a comparison I have been forced to investigate the Osteolepid structure
anew, and am able to add very many new and striking facts to our knowledge of the
osteology of that group. The Osteolepids resemble the Embolomeri in having a brain case which in all is well
ossified, although in the Upper Devonian Eusthenopteron and the Carboniferous Mega-
lichthys it is much less massive than in the Middle Devonian Osteolepis. This brain
â€˜case is not divided into separate bones in any known specimens, but the different regions
are easily recognised.
