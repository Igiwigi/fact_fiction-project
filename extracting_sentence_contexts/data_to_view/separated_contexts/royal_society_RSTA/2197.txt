It
has always been difficult to see why mere atomic weight should wield the influence
which has been pointed out by the author, and the author has been careful to
emphasise that he regarded atomic weight as only another progressively changing
property, very convenient, however, for purposes of reference as regards the chemical
position of the element, but equally with all the other progressing properties dependent
on some hitherto unknown fundamental difference in the chemical elementary atoms. This fundamental difference is now proved by Mosetxry to be the positive electric
3 charge on the atomic nucleus, and as this determines the atomic electronic com-
plexity and the atomic number is its measure, there is a logical reason why
increase in the atomic number, in the case of a regularly ascending series of family
group elements, should be effective in similarly progressively modifying the crystallo-
graphic and physical properties of isomorphous salts containing those elements. Moreover, the fact that both atomic weight and atomic number have been shown
above to be similarly related, in the case of the alkali metals, rubidium standing
exactly midway between potassium and cesium in both respects, affords full
explanation for the progression according to atomic weight which has been pointed
out by the author to occur in the eutropically isomorphous series, both the rhombic
simple salts and the monoclinic double salts, which have been described and
compared in this and the author’s former communications. * «Phil. Mag.,’ series 6, vol. 26, p. 1024 (1913), and vol. 27, p. 703 (1914) ; see also “ Obituary Notice,”
