We hypothesize that the greatest potential for direct
selection on epidemiological phenotypes may come from
scenarios in which there are direct fitness consequences to
the vector for being either susceptible or resistant to the para-
site/pathogen (e.g. [61]), and/or cases in which climate
change alters the diversity of available hosts for the disease
in question (potentially driving them towards increased
human bloodfeeding) [62]. (This is not to suggest that such
scenarios will not also experience ecologically driven selective
pressures or altered outcomes from resulting vector evolution,
merely that these may be cases in which the epidemiological
factors would act as the more intense pressure.)

From studying the evolutionary response to invasion into
novel environments, as we have just done, we can begin to
translate these findings into the likely impacts of climate
change. The diversity of the population under selection as cli-
mate change alters habitat is clearly analogous to our initially
invading population. The intensity of selective pressure will,
as already discussed, be more complicated than in the case
of invading stable-but-different novel environments and, in
fact, will interact inextricably with the rates of movement
among patches. Climate change-driven alterations in existing

By studying how invasive vector populations have responded to
novel environmental conditions in their newly invaded ranges,
we have shown that evolutionary change can be detected in
under a decade. These observed differences are beyond those
expected to occur due to genetic drift in geographically separ-
ated populations.
