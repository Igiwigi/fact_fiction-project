and four cases in which the effect was under 10, and averaged only 4. It is, there
fore, only by including cases of bilateral effects produced by powerful tonic discharges
that the above total average is so comparatively high.

If, therefore, these higher figures were separated from the Table, we should find that
the average effect on the same side would be not more than one-sixth of that on the
opposite side ; whilst, with evident and powerful bilateral discharges, the former effect
amounts to one-half of the latter.

Summary of Facts.

The facts brought forward in the preceding pages seem to show that it is possible —
to obtain completely unilateral effects in both spinal cord and nerve when one
cerebral hemisphere is excited, but that an increase in the intensity of the stimulus, —
and a diminution in the degree of narcosis, favour the production of bilateral effects—
the inequality between the crossed and uncrossed effect becoming less and less marked
in proportion as these favouring circumstances are augmented.

The conclusion to which the previous observations seemed to tend, that in one
cortex bilateral representation of the limbs exists, does not seem to be supported by —
the present experiments, since such bilateral effects as may be witnessed are specially
brought out by agencies which may be supposed to bring into play other portions of
