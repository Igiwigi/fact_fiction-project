(e) Acquisition of modes

Once the invariance defect of Grad’s approximation is computed, we can proceed to R13
equations, e.g. by adopting the relaxation time shortcut, multiplying the non-local invariance
defect (6.28) by —t and evaluating the R13 fluxes. However, due to the large number of terms with
different symmetry in (6.28), this makes it difficult to discern any structure behind the resulting
equations. Therefore, it is much more instructive to first rewrite Aploc as a superposition of modes,
in the same way as we have it for the Maxwellian. We therefore defer evaluation of fluxes to
§8, after we clarify the modes. To achieve that, some further transformation of the nonlinear
contributions is necessary. Specifically, by extracting the irreducible part of the rank-three tensor,
and taking into account the fact that o is trace-free, we transform Aplin. (6.18) as follows:

Aplin = ~ VR aC 9)(CaCgCy)(GapdyT) + —— O ~ wict- 14C? + 35)Cu(oupdgT). (6.29)
A similar transformation of Agin (6.19) yields
Agin= 5 eo 7)(CaCpCy) (Ga dpuy)

Furthermore, one immediately recognizes that Agia (6.22) and Agi (6.23) are composed of two
terms with the structure of the second and third primary modes,
