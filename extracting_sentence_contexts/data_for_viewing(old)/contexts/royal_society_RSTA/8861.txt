Fraunhofer line, and in the neighbouring continuous spectrum, and to the variation
of the ratio of these from the centre to the limb. If a Fraunhofer line is due to selective
absorption in an extensive absorbing mass, it should vanish at the limb in the continuous
background ; if it is due to any kind of selective scattering in a general scattering mass,
then the intensities in the line and just outside the line should be cut down in the same
ratio from the centre to the limb, since by the foregoing theory the darkening is
independent of the magnitude of the scattering. Scuwarzscui~p showed that the
observed relative decrease in intensity in the H and K lines was more compatible with the
constant ratio of line to background demanded by the scattering theory than with the
limb-vanishing demanded by the absorption theory, of which there is little trace. He
concluded that “ it is probable that the scattering of light plays an important réle in the
phenomena of the solar atmosphere.” Possibly a more detailed discussion of the
processes of absorption, especially taking into account the fact that Fraunhofer
lines appear to have their origins located at different levels, would modify this
conclusion ; it is, however, beyond the scope of the present paper to consider the question
of absorption lines.

ScuwarzscHitp confined himself to adjacent portions of the spectrum, where the
wave-length was practically the same but the absorption coefficient assumed different.
But there seems no reason why exactly the same reasoning should not be applied to
widely separated portions of the spectrum, where the coefficients of scattering are
different in virtue of the wave-lengths being different. ‘The intensities in such portions
