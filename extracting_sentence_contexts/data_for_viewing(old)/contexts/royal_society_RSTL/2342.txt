214 MR. HARRIS ON SOME ELEMENTARY LAWS OF ELECTRICITY.

resorted to in the prosecution of physical inquiries. Accordingly, I am led to avail
myself of it, but without extending it beyond the simple principle aboye mentioned.
The properties of this subtile matter, whether of an elementary or compound charac-
ter, if such should hereafter be more fully proved to exist, I leave only to be deter-
mined by adequate induction from observed phenomena.

4. Assuming, then, as an elementary principle, not upon the whole unwarranted by
facts, the existence of a subtile material agent essentially inyolyed in the constitution
of ordinary matter, and known to us only through the medium of its effects, we may
distinguish its presence under two different forms of what may be termed electrical
excitation ; that is to say, a state of excitation produced by a different relative state
of the electricity possessed by a body to that which is more or less common to all
bodies, in which case the quantity remains unchanged ; and a state of excitation de-
rived from an actual addition, or subtraction, of the electricity of a given snbstance,
or of any component part of its electricity, in which case the quantity may be said
to vary.

5. The latter of these states has been termed excitation by communication ; and the
former, when produced by the influence of this last, operating at a distance, excitation
by induction.
