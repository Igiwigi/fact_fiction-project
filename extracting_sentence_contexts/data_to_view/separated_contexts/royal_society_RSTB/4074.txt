The more theoretical discussion of the relation of lymph flow to functional activity
may be postponed till we have considered the exudation in the submaxillary gland. Our experiments are concordant in that they show an increase of exudation in
every case accompanying and long outlasting the activity of the muscle. Having established the fact that there is always an increase of exudation when the
muscle contracts, let us return to the question of what becomes of the fluid. In Experiment 11, of which we have the most complete data, a rough calculation
may be made of the total amount of exudation which took place. In the eight hours
which elapsed from the commencement of the stimulation till the end of the experiment
the exudation amounts to about 100 Â¢.c. of fluid.
