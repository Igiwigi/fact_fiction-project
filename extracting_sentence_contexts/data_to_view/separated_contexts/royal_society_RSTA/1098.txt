For
the Hopf case, excitatory synapses lead to stable synchrony (or near synchrony) (E5, green), while
inhibitory synapses lead to anti-phase (15, red). These figures show that both the nature of the
coupling and the shape of Z play an important role in determining the phase-locking properties
of symmetrically coupled oscillators. The fact that a pair of identical oscillators always leads to an odd effective coupling function
(the even terms do not matter) would lead one to believe that we could assume H is an odd
function. However, once more than two oscillators are connected, then the even component of the
