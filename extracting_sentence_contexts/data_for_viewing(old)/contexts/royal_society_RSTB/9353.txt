the pipette electrode. The pipette solution contained 1 1M free
Ca?*, thus directly inducing vesicle fusion. Note that this pro-
cedure excludes any pressure effect due to changes in kinetics
of calcium channels, and therefore gives a direct readout of
pressure effects on vesicle fusion per se. For details please refer
to Heinemann et al. [11].

Figure 3 shows measurements during secretion in chro-
maffin cells at various pressures. Figure 3a depicts the time
course of total capacitance at atmospheric pressure, starting
just before obtaining the whole-cell configuration at a holding
potential of â€”70 mV. Just after rupture of the patch, an arte-
fact due to the high-voltage pulse can be seen (seen also in
figure 3c), thereafter the step in capacitance corresponding
to the addition of the cell capacitance can be seen in the
record. Immediately after obtaining the whole-cell configur-
ation, the steady increase in capacitance due to vesicle
fusion induced by 1M free Ca** in the pipette solution
equilibrating with the internal solution of the cell can be
seen. Figure 3b shows a similar experiment in which a step
in pressure to 10 MPa was applied (middle trace, dotted
lines) while vesicles were being fused. The concomitant
pressure and change in temperature (lower traces) were
recorded. Note the significant decrease in vesicle-fusion rate
during the pressure step. The same procedure is seen in
