This unique capability of muon imaging is based
on the high penetrating power of high-energy muons. Muons are elementary particles, which
are similar to electrons but about 207 times heavier. Owing to the heavy mass of muons and the

fact that muons do not take part in the strong interaction, muons lose much less energy than :2
almost all of the other particles when passing through matter. Therefore, they can penetrate much DS
deeper. There are two types of muon imaging techniques.
