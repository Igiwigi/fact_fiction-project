present paper. As these authors point out, the mesarch protoxylem of T'mesipteris
finds its counterpart in Asteroxylon, and the same feature has been demonstrated by
SinnottÂ§ in some species of Lycopodium. The resemblance is increased by the fact,
now demonstrated, that in the genus T'mesipteris the stele of the aerial stem is not
ectophloic, as generally described, but that phloem also occurs laterally and centri-
petally to the bundles of the ring. The lateral phloems would correspond to the
phloem which occupies the bays between the xylem salients of Asterorylon and
Lycopodium. The facts before us appear fully to warrant the suggestion that the scattered medullary
strands of 7m. Vieillardi are the vestiges of a once continuous axial column running
presumably through the whole length of the stem.
