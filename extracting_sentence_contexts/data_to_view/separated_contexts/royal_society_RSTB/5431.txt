40 L. BE. 8. EASTHAM ON THE EMBRYOLOGY OF PIERIS RAPA.â€”ORGANOGENY.

already pointed out its close similarity, on account of position and the fact that it loses
its hypodermal connection, to the hypostigmatic gland in both Bombyx and Pieris. The above-mentioned embryologists who homologised tentorial and silk gland invagina-
tions with spiracles contended that the anterior tentorial arms represented an original
first spiracle and the posterior tentorial arms of the second maxillary segment corre-
sponded to the third pair of spiracles. The additional pair of spiracles on this same
segment in Apis precludes Netson from maintaining the homology suggested by
Patmen (1877), HarscHex (1877), and Carriere and Bireer (1898), viz., between
tentoria and spiracles.
