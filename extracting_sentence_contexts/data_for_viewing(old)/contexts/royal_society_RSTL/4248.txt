themselvyes oyer in water as well as in the air, and from his believing that this change
of position in the two surfaces of leaves is the result of the contortion or the inflec-
tion of the footstalk.

DuTrocner indeed attributes to the influence of light the turning over of leaves,
but he considers the flat part of the leaf as passive, and the footstalk as the only
agent in its motion. He quotes besides no other experiment in proof of the influence
of light but those of Boxxer, and especially the one in which some leaves of a cherry-
tree, placed under the shadow of a table 80 as to receive light laterally, put them-
selves in a vertical position with the end downwards.

He gives for the chief ground of his opinion respecting the action of light in this
phenomenon, the fact that having placed a Convolvulus in the circumference of a
wheel rapidly reyolving, the leaves after eighteen hours presented their upper surface
to the centre of rotation and their under one to the circumference. He concludes
from this experiment that leaves present naturally their upper surface to the light ;
but, as DecanpoLLE justly observes, it would have been more natural to conclude
from it that they present it to gravitation. He recapitulates his opinion in these
words:—©I have attempted without snccess to discover how light acts in deter-
mining the torsion of the footstalk when the leaf is turned over. It seems evident
that in this circumstance the influence of light is exercised on the flat part of the
reversed leaf, and that this influence is transmitted to the footstalk whose contor-
tion it produces; but I do not see here what is the connection between cause and
effect. The turning over of a leaf depends on two different causes :—first, the dis-
position of the footstalk to raise itself towards the sky when it has been accidentally
