The catenated chromosomes of
Oenothera are linked up end-to-end from the earliest stages of meiosis, whereas free
pairs are free from the earliest stages. This applies equally when both types of
arrangement are found, as they are in many biotypes, in the same cell. Daruinctonâ€™s idea that chiasmata are necessary to produce meiotic pairing is
disproved not only by the facts already cited in Oenothera but by various other lines
of evidence, only one of which need be mentioned here. A number of cases of
secondary pairing of chromosomes, both in heterotypic and homotypic mitosis,
shows that this must be due to a residual attraction between similar elements and is
entirely independent of chiasma formation. Generally, this secondary pairing
does not express itself at all in diakinesis, at a time when the bivalents all repel each
other owing to a superficial charge.
