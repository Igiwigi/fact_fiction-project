These figures fully illustrate the modification the muscle curve undergoes after ;

benzaconine, evidence of rapid fatigue being shown in the lengthening of contraction
and fall of altitude, the residual contraction being also increased.

Exhaustion of motor nerve endings is in part causal to these phenomena, and it is
further clear that they are capable of becoming fatigued when they do not transmit
an influence, developing a coordinate muscular contraction. This fact, as well as
the consideration that they recover when circulation is suspended, seems to show
that accumulation of waste products from muscular contraction does not contribute
to the failure.

Action on Skeletal Muscle, including Muscle Curve.

Minimal excitability of the muscle tissue is reduced by benzaconine. In seven
experiments it was found that the impairment occurred uniformly in 5, the extent
being from 1 to 8 centims. (distance of secondary coil from primary). In the two
remaining experiments there was equal excitability on the two sides,

Contrasted with the normal or protected muscle, the muscle exposed to the free
