In addition to burrow characteristics, the role of parents
during and after burrow construction varies across species.
Burrows may be constructed by male and/or female parents.
Male Hy. faber construct multiple nests and attract females to
them on subsequent nights [57,64]. Whether females prefer
certain nests and what role this plays in mating success is
unclear. Parental roles also vary post-construction and egg-
laying. Some species remain with offspring while others do
