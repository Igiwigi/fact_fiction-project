3We have fitted the empirical cumulative distributions in an interval of distances between 700 and 2000, to remove the effect

of short distances and the possible undersampling at large distances. We have verified that reducing the lower extreme of the
interval up to 300 and increasing the higher extreme up to the maximum length did not change the results significantly.


The resulting fitting parameters are shown in table 1. As can be seen, the fit is very good (1? >
0.998, x? < 0.1) for the group of organisms in figure 1 which showed a different CG distribution.
Moreover, for these organisms, the fitting parameters are very similar, with a characteristic length
ranging from 200 to about 300 bases (from a minimum of 214 for Equus to a maximum of 294 for
mouse). The only exception is Monodelphis, which has a characteristic length of 452, nearly double
the others. This may be due to the fact that in this organism CpG autosomal density is very
different from the other amniotes (0.9% versus 1.7-2.2% [44]). For the other group of organisms,
once again, the situation is more heterogeneous: for example, for Apis and Danio, the exponential
function seems to fit the empirical data well (?? = 0.98, x2 = 0.1) and also the characteristic lengths
are comparable with the ones of the first group (A = 296 and 299, respectively), while Drosophila
and Saccharomyces have very good fits (r? > 0.99, x? ~ 0.1 for S. cerevisiae), but their characteristic
lengths differ by an order of magnitude (A = 44 and 37, respectively). For the other organisms, :
the exponential distribution seems unfit, even if with a heterogeneous degree of dissimilarity (see :=

electronic supplementary material, figure S2, for a visual inspection). Sy
Finally, we remark that some small characteristic lengths could be related to the small size 2

of the genome of the organism (as for Adenovirus, E. coli and S. cerevisiae), but this association nee)
