476 MR. BOWMAN ON THE MINUTE STRUCTURE AND

This structure can usually be seen best in specimens prepared when recent, but I
have preparations which show it perfectly preserved in parts long steeped in $pirit.
From its extreme tenuity, it would hardly be likely to attract any attention, were it
not that, without extraordinary care, it is apt to be detached in different ways from the
bundle invested by it, and s0 to become an isolated object. But when its existence
is known, it may often be discovered in unbroken fasciculi, as obseryed by Murres,
under the form of a straight linear margin, uninterrupted, and independent of the
strize; which, however, will very probably seem at first to pass completely across,
though they terminate, in fact, within this edge. Some accurate observers have
doubted the prominence of the beads of the fibrille, because they have been unable
to see their bulge at the extreme edge of the fasciculus, a circumstance which may
depend on the existence of this sheath.

It may also be frequently seen encircling the areas of fasciculi in the transverse
sections of dried muscle (fig. 7. a.), but the readiest and most satisfactory manner of
demonstrating it, is to take the fresh muscle of a fish or reptile, and by seizing single
fasciculi by one of their extremities, to pull them from the mass. In this operation
they undergo considerable stretching, and often break entirely across. But such
fractures will vary in extent, and 80 display the sarcolemma, for this is more extensile
than the fibrille inclosed in it, and therefore, where these have given way, it often re-
mains entire, investing both fragments, and connecting them together. In snch a case
