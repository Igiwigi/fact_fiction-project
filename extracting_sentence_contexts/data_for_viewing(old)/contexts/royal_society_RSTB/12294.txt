absent whenever the monkeys missed a cued vocalization,
or when they vocalized spontaneously between trials.
Third, and most importantly, vIPFC neurons showed a
strong correlation between the onset of neuronal activity
and the timing of vocal output: irrespective of the monkeysâ€™
call reaction times, vIPFC neurons showed ramping-onset
activity approximately 1.2 s prior to the call [136]. These var-
ious observations point to a direct involvement of the vIPFC
in forming a decision signal for initiating vocalization. A rea-
listic scenario is that the vIPFC, which does not directly
project to M1, gains control over the vocal motor network
via the premotor cortex (PM), which in turn projects directly
to M1 [176,204,205]. In fact, the corticobulbar (for orofacial
and laryngeal movements) and corticospinal (for thoracic
and diaphragm movements [160]) pathways that originate
from both M1 and PM are ideal substrates for volitional
vocal control.

In new-world monkeys, the role of the frontal lobe in voli-
tional vocal control has not yet been investigated, but there is
emerging evidence for the general involvement of frontal cor-
tical areas in vocal production [206]. Microelectrode
recordings of prefrontal (PFC) and premotor (PMC) cortical
areas during antiphonal calling have found vocalization-
related activity that often precedes or is phase locked to the
