Thus, in reality,
“object of a given size’’ becomes synonymous with a normal host, for the most common
objects of this size occurring in the particular environment of Trichogramma are eggs of
various insects, which from their nature contain other characters co-existent with this
size factor. The stupidity of the actions of the female is more apparent than real, for
in recognizing the so-called ecological and psychological selection, the investigator
is confusing isolation in thought with isolation in nature. It seems, therefore, that the contention that a parasite generally ‘‘chooses”’ as its
hosts those which are suitable for the development of its progeny must be accepted
as an observable fact; the primary tendency of Ooencyrtus and Trichogramma to avoid
ovipositing in parasitized hosts in which only one parasite can develop is a particularly
interesting illustration of the degree to which this obtains in nature. The action of the
female Ooencyrtus in rejecting a parasitized gipsy moth egg can only be understood by
