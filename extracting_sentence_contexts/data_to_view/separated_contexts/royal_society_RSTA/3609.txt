This
suggests that, at least in the PKT, there is not a clear direct relationship between KREEP and
OH~, probably due to the complicated volcanic history of the region and the different sensing
depths of near-infrared and gamma-ray spectroscopy. The SPA Basin is the largest impact basin on the Moon, and should have excavated significant
amounts of lower crust and mantle material. However, few craters within SPA exhibit OH~
relative band depths in excess of the local global mean; in fact, most are depleted in OHâ„¢ relative
to the global mean. One exception to this is within the Apollo Basin, which was formed near the

northern edge of the basin. The mafic anomaly in SPA is dominated by the spectral signature of : =
orthopyroxene, with some clinopyroxene concentrated in the centre near Mafic Mound [46].
