THe Type OF THE OPHIOGLOSSACEÂ®,

There seems good reason to believe that the Sphenophylleze were homosporous,
though this is not decisively proved. The Ophioglossaces are also homosporous,
with their spore-bearing organs occupying typically the same position, higher or
lower, on the adaxial face of the sporophyll as that in the Lycopods, Psilotacez,
and Sphenophylle. The facts have been stated, and their bearings discussed at
length elsewhere; a short summary will therefore suffice, with a reference to the
former Memoir. * The whole question of the relations of this family turns upon whether they be
regarded as an ascending or a descending series.
