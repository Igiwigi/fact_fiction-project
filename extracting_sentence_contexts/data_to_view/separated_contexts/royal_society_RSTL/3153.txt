Hence conversely, when the attractive forces are at distance unity,
4, 9, &e, times as great, then the respective quantities of electricity accumulated,
under the existing disposition of the conducting surface, are 2, 3, &c. times as great ;
the quantity being as the square root of the indicated force. Similar obseryations
apply to a variety of other quantitative measurements, of which this instrament is
susceptible, as in the case of the attractive force communicated to the insulated plate
F, when connected with a charged conductor of any given form, and which by experi-
ment remains invariable, at whatever point of it the connection be made. Hence the
general electrical intensity of snch a conductor is always represented under any new
disposition of its surface, as shown in my experiments on the capacity of rectangular
plates, cylinders, spheres*, &e. These and similar facts deducible by experiment
enable us, independently of all theory, to investigate by this electrometer certain elec-
trical relations, such as that of quantity to surface, of intensity to figure, and the like,
with accuracy and precision. This question then being disposed of, we may proceed
to the further consideration of the elementary laws of electrical action, the subject
of these inquiries. 7.
