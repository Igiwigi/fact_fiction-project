As it is clearly a form of importance, an effort was made to secure material for
fresh observation of the facts. Through the kindness of friends in New Zealand
specimens have been supplied upon which the following description of the sorus is
based. A vertical section through a sorus of medium age shows, as in fig. 63, the
short receptacle, sporangia, and hairs are included within the cup-like indusium ;
there is an obvious basipetal sequence of the sporangia, and I have never observed
any departure from this order.
