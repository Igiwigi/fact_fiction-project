On substituting this value for * in (20), neglecting squares of b and equating
corresponding harmonic terms, we obtain

In general, this gives the value of A, which determines the tide raised by a field of

independently of the values of «,a@. This merely expresses the obvious fact that
there can be no equilibrium at all so long as the fluid is acted on by a force
proportional to a harmonic of the first order. If it is possible for there to be a configuration of equilibrium when v, = 0, other
than that given by A, = 0, this configuration will of course determine a point of
bifurcation inthe series of symmetrical configurations. The points of bifurcation are
accordingly given by v, = 0, or es
