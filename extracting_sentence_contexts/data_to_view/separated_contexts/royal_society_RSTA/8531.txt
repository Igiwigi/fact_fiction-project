WILSON: INVESTIGATIONS ON LIGHTNING DISCHARGES

the picture as a whole) that a charge of electricity had been concentrated in a
comparatively small volume in the head of the cloud, and that the discharges took
place approximately along lines of force. The mean height of the upper ends of the two discharges—the height of the
centre of the charged cloud-head according to this view—must have been just under
2 km., if its horizontal distance from the camera is taken as 11°7 km. The distance
and height may in fact have been somewhat greater, since the track of the long flash
may at some point of its course have been nearer the camera than the vertical flash,
and the distance deduced from the interval between the lightning and thunder is
that of the nearest point of the discharge. VUI. Electric Field of a Thunder-cloud.
