and somatic capital, but having little impact on descendant sur-
vival or reproductive success [5,6]. In short, parents are not
effective in trading off quantity for quality in such a way as
to maximize fitness. Rather, parents behave as if ever more
investment in offspring will pay off in the competitive
market economy, where increasingly rare skills yield increas-
ingly high salaries and social prestige [82]. Furthermore, they
appear motivated to imitate the investment patterns of the
most prestigious members of the community [133,134], with
diverse values generating increasingly complex cultural


evolutionary dynamics [40,135]. However, despite the fact that
families are patently much smaller than any optimizing model
would predict, there is a sense in which the quantity—quality
trade-off holds—at least through the perception of quality.
This suggests there is adaptive lag in mechanisms governing
fertility. Under modernization, humans elevate their percep-
tion of the costs of high fertility on offspring capital, leading
to a correspondingly exaggerated strategy of fertility limitation
[16,35,136]. For example, echoing Lack’s clutch size hypothesis,
Kaplan et al. propose that that:

Because human parents and grandparents provision children,
