Examining attentively the numbers which I have just exposed, and taking into
consideration the reflections made above, and those principally which establish the
fact, that the total current increases perceptibly with the number of nerves, it appears
to me that we ought to conclude from these experiments that it is sufficiently demon-
strated, and true as far as this kind of experiment admits of demonstration, that the
electro-physiological effect is proportional to the intensity of the current. Pisa, February 1847.
