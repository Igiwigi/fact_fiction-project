Water saturated with rock-salt . . . . : 20

These results are but approximate, but they are not very far from the truth ; and it
is impossible to regard them without feeling how purely the act of absorption is a
molecular act, and that when a liquid is a powerful absorber the vapour of that liquid
is sure also to be a powerful absorber.

To experiment with water, it was necessary to saturate it with the salt of which the
cell was formed, but the absorptive energy is due solely to the water. We might infer
from this alone, were no experiments made on the aqueous yapour of the atmosphere,
that that vapour must exert a powerful action upon terrestrial radiation. In fact, in all
the statements that I have hitherto made I have underrated its action.

The deportment of the elements sulphur and iodine, dissolved in bisulphide of carbon,
is in striking harmony with all that we have hitherto discovered regarding the action of
elementary bodies. The saturation of the bisulphide by sulphur scarcely affects the
transmission, while a quantity of iodine sufficient to conyert the liquid from one of
perfect transparency to one of almost perfect opacity to light, produces a diminution of
only two per cent. of the radiation. This shows that the heat really used in these expe-
riments consists almost wholly of the obscure rays of the lamp. It is worth remarking
that the obscure rays of a luminous source have a much greater power of penetration in
the case of the liquids here examined than the rays from an obscure source, however
close to incandescence. The deportment of bromine is also very instructive. The liquid
