and _silver-cadmium,
silver-indium, and silver-tin. In all these alloys the lattice distortion is nearly
the same and is relatively small. The fact that the solvent and solute atoms are in
the same period means that the quantum numbers of the outer electron shells of
solvent and solute are the same, whilst differences due to atomic weights or atomic
number are slight, so that everything is favourable for showing the pure valency effects
free from complicating factors. Fire. 2.
