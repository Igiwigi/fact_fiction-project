provided that the infinite integral on the left in (2:10) converges, uniformly with respect to n, 5 that is to

In order to apply this lemma, we must check that p(x) and a(x), given by (2:1) and
(2-4), satisfy (2-8); since p(0) = (0) = 0, we have only to show that
fap(x), [ ao()

are uniformly bounded. However, in order to verify the condition (2-11) we shall need the

more general fact that
[\x |™ dp™(x), | |x|™do™(x) (m= 0,1, 2, ...)

are uniformly bounded (for each fixed m). This we prove by observing that ¢,_(x) has
degree s and leading term x°, and hence that any power x” can be expressed uniquely as
