It is usually seen to arise at the point where the anterior inferior cerebellar leaves
the brachium pontis and extends on to the cerebellum, a point where the artery
is in close relationship with the auditory and facial nerves.”

No more striking testimony to the accuracy of Stoprorp’s observations could be
given than fig. 1 of this paper, which shows the union of the two arteries in close relation-
ship to the auditory and facial nerves, at the same time it reveals the constancy of
arterial distribution. I would finally suggest that, whilst no good purpose would be
served in changing the nomenclature, the above statement would be more in accord with
morphological facts if it were made to read that the internal auditory and anterior inferior
cerebellar arteries frequently arise by a common stem from the basilar artery ; this
stem is the stem of the so-called anterior inferior cerebellar if it lies ventral to the
abducent nerve, and internal auditory if it lies dorsal to it. It must not be forgotten,
however, that stems even higher or lower may be employed for cerebellar distribution ;
in fact, a stem so low as that of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery may take over the
distribution of blood to the supplying arteries of the higher segments. This description of the vessels of the hind-brain, whilst indicating a uniform under-
lying pattern, shows the difficulty of the interpretation of symptoms following lesions
of them. One cannot expect to find a definite syndrome for any particular artery
because of its complex and variable nature, nevertheless Sroprorp’s work on trigeminal
lesions in the hind-brain suggests that the metameric branches are distributed to areas
of functional value.
