The action on the spinal cord
was indicated by a tendency to tremor and the action on the brain by lethargy. We observed certain differences in the symptoms, both motor and sensory, caused
by various members of the group. We were struck by the fact that the symptoms
they cause in Frogs bear a certain resemblance to those produced by certain diseases
of the spinal cord in Man. Thus, benzene causes a tremor which seldom occurs but
when movement is attempted, and in this resembles the tremor of disseminated
sclerosis, whilst monochlorobenzene, monoiodobenzene, and also amidobenzene cause
the movements to assume a violent slapping character, which reminds one of the
movements occurring in locomotor ataxy, a disorder in which the posterior columns of
the cord are affected.
