in two-dimensional geometry. The tip radius for ice dendrites grown in pure water with the
sixfold symmetry represents a monotonously decreasing function of undercooling (figure 4a).
On the other hand, large undercooling leads to an increase in the growth rate of crystal vertices
(figure 4b). The undercooling balance (3.11) and selection criterion (4.18) well agree with the
phase-field simulations.

Another comparison is made in figure 5 for the same dendrites evolving in three-dimensional
geometry. Here, we have two tip radii: pg in the basal plane and p2 < p¢ in the perpendicular
plane. To calculate these radii, we apply the selection criterion (4.18) twice, in each of these planes
(using the constant aspect ratio for ice crystals in the form of elliptical paraboloids [47]). As is
easily seen, the tip radii and growth rate have the same behaviour: pg and p2 decrease and V
increases with increasing AT. The slight discrepancy between theory and modelling for a larger
radius is explained by the fact that instead of the Ivantsov solutions for axisymmetric crystals, in
this case, it is necessary to use the Horvey—Cahn solutions for non-axisymmetric ice crystals in
the form of elliptical paraboloids [35,38].

Figure 6 compares the present theory and computations carried out for nickel crystals with the
fourfold symmetry using the enthalpy-based method. Here, we compare the tip diameter p4 and
tip velocity V as functions of the melt undercooling AT for various forced flow velocities U, fixed
far from the growing dendrite. It is easy to see that an increase in the rate of fluid flow U leads
to an increase in the growth rate V of dendrites and thinning of the dendritic tips (4 becomes
smaller). This results in a finer-grained structure of the solid phase of the material and a shorter
crystallization time for the sample.
