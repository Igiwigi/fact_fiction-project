1. A large number of such electrolytes follow the Van ’t Hoff law with close
approximation over a considerable range of dilution. (See Bancrort, ‘ Zeit. Phys.
Chem.,’ 31, 191, 1899, and for KCl see Bousrrexp, ‘ Zeit. Phys. Chem.,’ 53, p. 268,
1905, where diagram for KCl is given.)

For KCl the value of the index is 2:2 for uncorrected «.

2. In order to test the law with great accuracy, we ought to examine it over a range
of dilutions so high that the viscosity is practically constant and the increase of ionic
size (if any) is practically complete. In such a case we might expect to find the value
of n practically constant and equal to 3, if the Van ’t Hoff law holds accurately. It
is impossible to make such a test, owing to the fact that the error introduced by the
uncertainty us to the correction for the conductivity of the solvent, multiplied by the

large factor necessary to obtain the equivalent conductivity, entirely swamps the small
difference (if any) from the exact value of the index which we desire to detect.

Hence the only available means of investigation is to get the true value of at
high dilutions, by extrapolation from lesser dilutions where the errors to which
