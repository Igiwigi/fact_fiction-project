In the simplest case, C(s) may be approximated by a delta function, such that 5, = Cp Vi/2, where
Co is the area under the function C(s), and the factor 1/2 comes from the fact that the integral goes
only over the positive half-axis. In this case, the master equation (2.17) is of Lindblad form with the
Hermitian Lindblad operator /CoV;. Note, however, that there are many interesting cases where
C(s) has a different functional behaviour, which then yields a rather unusual dissipation term.

(ii) Random matrix theory model

We use here the approach of constructing the average density matrix proposed in [14] rather
than calculating properties for each member of the ensemble and averaging these properties
afterwards. For details, see [15,16]. Let us assume that the master equation derived above is
of Lindblad form with a single Lindblad operator Vi. Then, we may choose Cy =1 without
restriction. Let us further assume that V{ is a fixed member of the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble
(GOE) or the Gaussian unitary ensemble (GUE). This may be justified for an environment
