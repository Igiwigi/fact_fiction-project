From the preceding statement we may, I think, conclude,

1Ist, That venous blood contains carbonic acid ;

2nd, That the mere effect of diminished pressure upon the surface of the blood is
not necessarily followed by the escape of its carbonic acid*,

We have seen in some of the aboye experiments that atmospheric air possesses a
property of removing carbonic acid from venous blood; it becomes therefore a
question how this effect is produced. I have ascertained that nitrogen is ineffective;
we may therefore infer that the oxygen is the principal agent ; and that such is the
fact is proved by the following experiments.

10. A piece of moist bladder was tied firmly over the mouth of a tumbler contain-
ing pure oxygen gas. This was introduced into a large bell glass filled with carbonic
acid. In a short period the membrane which had been tied over the glass became
convex, and 80 tense that it appeared to be on the point of bursting. On examining
the air contained in the tumbler, it was found that the oxygen had drayn in a large

* In performing the above experiments I was assisted by Mr. Squrss, to whom I feel under great obligation
for the zealous and able manner in which he aided me in the whole of the present investigation,
