BY INCREASE OF THE INTRA-CRANIAL PRESSURE OR TENSION. 219

8. Fall of blood pressure.

The blood pressure usually falls slightly before the heart rate is slowed. In some
cases this depressor effect is very marked and apparently persists (see Tracing VII.).
For, after the vagi had been divided, the rise in blood pressure was only very slow,
differing much from the sudden rise which usually takes place on that operation.
The phenomenon usually only occurs with the firet application of the pressure, vide
infra. This active depressor influence also occurred with an arrest of respiration,
and the respiration did not begin again for some time after the pressure had been
removed, and artificial respiration had been used. The connexion of these two facts
will appear under B,

A. (1.) R. For the effects upon respiration see A. (2.), the effects in the present
section being so slightly marked.

A. (2.) H. Slowing, arrest, ond recovery of heart.â€”When pressure is applied to any
part of the cerebral or cerebellar hemispheres.

a. Slowing and arrest of the heart preceded by cessation of the respiration.
The respiration ceases, the heart which before was going at a normal rate
is immediately slowed and is soon arrested. In such a case the effect of
artificial respiration is such that the action of the heart immediately
