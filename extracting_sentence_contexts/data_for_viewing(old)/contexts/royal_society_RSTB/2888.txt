exceedingly low temperatures are given, and, for the purposes of comparison, also a
few experiments on phanerogams.

JumELLE, who was the first to experiment below 0° C., claims to have proved
that respiration ceases about —10° C., whereas assimilation persists to —30° C. or
even to —40° C. His procedure is, however, unsatisfactory.

A limited amount of CO, was admitted into the plant chamber through a long
glass inlet tube ; samples of the air were then removed through the same tube at the
beginning and end of the experiments and were analysed by means of a Bonnier and
Mangin apparatus.

In the first place, exception must be taken to the long inlet tube, and to the fact
that it serves both to admit the CO, and to remove the samples. It might be some
time before identity of composition between the air in the chamber and the air in the
tube was established by diffusion, and the air removed for analysis would consist
mainly of the contents of the tube. Since to indicate respiration the second sample
must contain more CO, than the first, the existence of a feeble respiration might
easily be masked by such an experimental error. On the other hand, a feeble
assimilation might be augmented by the same cause.

JuMELLE’s results suggest exactly such errors, respiration ceasing at a temperature
far above that at which assimilation continued. Blank experiments performed under
the same conditions would show at once whether this criticism is just or not. In
the absence of any indication as to the probable experimental errors, and considering
