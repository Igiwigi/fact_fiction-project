The first salt has a stability in solution which
the latter two salts do not enjoy. Extraordinary osmose is here, therefore, associated with facility of decomposition,
as in 80 many other instances. The influence of the presence of acids and of ehloride of sodium upon the osmose
of chloride of mercury was tried in the search for facts which might throw light on
the osmotic process. An acid in small proportion appears to fayour, rather than otherwise, the osmose
of chloride of mercury. Chloride of sodium, on the other hand, exerts its usual
repressing influence upon the process.
