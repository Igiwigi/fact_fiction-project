(12.) Q, also represents the suwm of the numbers of men or women living at all ages
over the age &, out of Q, living at all ages, as Q, is in all cases the sum of the numbers
living in each year of age, represented by the series P,. 'The unit is here an individual

(13.) Thus, on referring to Plate XLII. fig. 1, the lifetime of 100,000 children
born simultaneously may be represented by 100,000 parallel lines, drawn from AB
horizontally in the direction of CD until they cut the curved line BC. And Q, is

1t will be observed that in this Table, instead of 100,000 lines, these lines are thrown
into 106 groups, each comprising the variable number of lines terminating in each of
106 intervals numbered on the line AC, and representing years of age.
