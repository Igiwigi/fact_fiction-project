Neither is it derived to any considerable extent from the
valleys and lower slopes of the surrounding hills. There is no permanent drainage of
air from these hill-slopes, and strong winds blowing outwards from the larger valleys,
like the dadu of Hurdwar, are local and exceptional phenomena, restricted to certain
hours of the day. At all the hill-stations of the outer North-West Himalaya, as far as
‘the existing registers show, southerly winds preponderate over northerly all through
the year ; and, although this is probably due in some measure to the fact that the night
winds have not hitherto been registered, it suffices to show that, up to a level of 7000
feet, there is no steady outflow of air from the hills to the plains. ‘There remains then only the supposition that these winds are fed by the descent
of air from an upper stratum, viz., from a current moving at a considerable elevation
from west toeast. And that this is their true explanation several facts seem to testify.
