* A low-resistance galvanometer was tried and rejected.


46 MR. E. H. GRIFFITHS ON THE DETERMINATION OF SOME BOILING

It was found necessary not only to place the galvanometer on an insulating stand,
but also the batteries and key. All connecting wires were run through india-rubber
or glass tubes. Until this was done the galvanometer showed a permanent: deflection
after the wires were attached to the batteries. The whereabouts of this leakage I
never discovered.

5. The apparatus was placed in rooms adjoining the Sidney Laboratory, and I was
much troubled by the vibration caused by the traffic. In fact it was only possible to
take some of the observations (such as those in which I wished to trace the process of
surfusion during the freezing of metals) late at night. One great difficulty I met
with at the outset, z.e., the warming of the thermometer-coil by the current used when
determining its resistance, and since it was necessary, during some of the observations
on surfusion, to maintain the current for several seconds at a time, the point was one
of considerable importance.

CALLENDAR mentions that he used six Leclanch√© cells without any trouble of this
kind. I found it impossible to use two unless I lowered the current by introducing
extra battery resistance. The effect was clearly traceable if too strong a current was
used, If the arms of the bridge were in equilibrium and the key held down, the spot
would gradually slide away in the direction indicating a steady increase in the
