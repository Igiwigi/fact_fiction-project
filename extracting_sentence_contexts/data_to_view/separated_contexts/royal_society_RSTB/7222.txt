In cases where the degree of reduction required is not large, and where the correction of
the chromatic difference of magnification of the observer’s eye is not wanted, a telescope,
or even an opera-glass of suitable power, held in the hand makes a convenient and simple
reducing lens system. (137) Tests of the reducing lens system

Tests of a very searching kind should be applied to any apparatus of new design. These
are particularly necessary in the case of the instrument described in this communication,
because one essential part, the reducing lens system, is being used for a purpose for which
it was not originally designed, in fact the rays of light are passing through it in the reverse
direction to the normal. Table 96 lists those tested or measured. Tase 96.
