In the study of a few specimens of the brains of Monotremes and Marsupials, it was
discovered that in spite of the published work upon the brain of Ornithorhynchus by
such savants as Kor tiixer (1901), ZreHmn (1908), and Extior Smrru (1898-1900),
knowledge of the brain stem of this interesting mammal was incomplete, as judged
by present-day standards. It was felt that with the introduction of more recent
viewpoints, a new study of this subject might chance to give the old facts new relation-
ships. This monograph, as one of the rapidly increasing number of analyses of the
brains of vertebrates, may help to clarify in part the inter-relationships between the
brains of lower forms and those of mammals. VOL, CCOXVIILâ€”B 443, Y (Published January 5, 1929.
