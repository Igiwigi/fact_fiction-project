It is expected that behaviour in this regime would be close to 1D-
like, but more detailed simulations would be required to make exact claims about performance. Instead, these results are intended as indicators of the level of performance that may be possible
in such a regime, to assess its viability. The potential of stable implosions in this regime, coupled
with the fact that these estimates of gain are indeed high enough to be of interest, suggests that
this regime does therefore warrant further investigation.

6. Outlook

The results demonstrated in this paper suggest some clear directions for future work. The

most obvious next step is to increase the dimensionality, performing 2D simulations to : =
investigate hydrodynamic instability growth and provide further confidence that performance : >
is approximately one-dimensional in this regime.
