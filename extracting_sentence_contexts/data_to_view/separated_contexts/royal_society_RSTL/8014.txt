The 8ame regularity in the superposition of the thin margins is found
here as in fig. 18. Fig. 19, & represents the layer of tubular prosenchyma, and 7 the
turgid bases of three more petioles. That the latter only exhibit the marginal membra-
nous expansion on one side (19, 7') is due to the fact that the section has passed obliquely
through the petioles, and only crossed in the plane of those expansions on one side. Plate XXVI. fig. 20 is a longitudinal section of a fragment of the same species of Lepi-
dodendron as the last, supplied to me by Mr. WurrTAkER, of Oldham, and which I have
figured because it displays very clearly the somewhat elongated form of parenchyma of
which these petioles consist.
