thus carry a resultant charge. For example, a stratiform cloud above a cumulo-
nimbus cloud will intercept the flow of ions from the upper atmosphere and become
charged with electricity of opposite sign to that of the upper pole of the shower-cloud,
a steady condition not being reached until a potential difference between the thunder-
cloud and the upper atmosphere is concentrated almost entirely in the region below
the stratiform cloud. Lightning discharges between the stratiform cloud and the
head of the primary thunder-cloud below will be likely to occur.

In the absence of any such cloud above the primary thunder-cloud, the great
diminution of the mobility of ions or electrons dragged out of the conducting layers
as they penetrate into the denser regions of the atmosphere will have a very similar
effect ; the concentration of charge will be greatest where the change of conductivity
with the height is most rapid. We may in fact, as suggested in Section VIIL,
consider that the conditions are much the same as if a conducting protuberance were
drawn out from the conducting layer towards the summit of the thunder-cloud. It
does not seem unlikely that discharges may sometimes occur between this protuberance
and the top of the thunder-cloud. In a previous paper some evidence was obtained
suggesting the occurrence of discharges of very great vertical length ; possibly these
may have been of the type we have been considering.

* This action of a layer of cloud, in particular of a ground fog, in increasing the vertical electric field
within it has long been recognised in the case of the potential gradient of fine weather. ExsTeR and
