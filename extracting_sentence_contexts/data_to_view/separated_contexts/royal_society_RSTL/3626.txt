There is however one difficulty not so easily overcome. Water is a binary com-
pound, and it might be expected that on mixing a hydrated acid and base, or on dis-
s0lving in water a alt, such as nitrate of potash, or nitrate of ammonia, a certain
amount of both the acid and the base would remain in combination merely with
water. That it is not 80, is proved by the fact that solutions of the salts just named
do not give up any portion of their volatile base or acid, even on boiling. Has a
limit to the action of the general law been here arrived at? Is water an exception
standing by itself?
