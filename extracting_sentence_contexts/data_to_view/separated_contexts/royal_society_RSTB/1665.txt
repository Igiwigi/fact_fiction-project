On the other hand, the intensity
of the individual organ response in the last-named fish is but little affected by a
central fatigue which has so sensibly influenced the central periodicity. The efferent
cell discharge, when it does occur, may still be very pronounced. In connection
with this there is the suggestive fact of the striking difference in the structure
of the central nervous mechanism. The Zorpedo, with its large electrical lobes, con-
taining thousands of nerve cells, giving rise to 80,000 efferent electrical nerve fibres,
forms an extraordinary contrast to the Malapterwrus with its two nerve cells and
two nerve fibres. Finally, the results referred to in this section, throw some light on the efficiency
for its purpose of the organ activity.
