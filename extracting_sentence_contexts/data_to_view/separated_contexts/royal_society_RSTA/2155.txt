It follows that there is some
(j1,J2) # (0,0) such that A(j1/01,j2/€2) < A(0,0), contradicting our initial assumption. Therefore,
the weight of Z(t, ce: t) is greater than that of A(0,0). The final statement of theorem 1.10 follows from the fact that A(0,0) — A(1/2,1/2) =h!"/2. Table 3. Approximate values in theorem 1.7, N = 2.
