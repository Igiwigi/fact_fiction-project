Here there was now discovered a few
undoubted, though indeed most crudely chipped, artifacts of vein quartz embedded in
the hard breccia (Quartz Horizon 1, 51; fig. 30). This horizon was also characterized
by the presence of much black pigment, the latter in places being of the consistency
of wet powder. Chemical examination of this powder subsequently demonstrated that
the black coloration was in fact almost entirely due to its high content of free carbon,
such an accumulation of charcoal furnishing definite proof of the local action of fire
(Buack, 1931). Quarrying operations in the hard breccia of the floor of Kotzetang cave, beginning
at a level approximately 5 metres below that of Quartz Horizon 1, were begun by Mr. Pet,
assisted by Mr. Pren, towards the end of April. This work was pushed on vigorously,
and before the end of June the now classic stratum known as “ Quartz Horizon 2.”
or “Cultural Zone C,” was encountered.
