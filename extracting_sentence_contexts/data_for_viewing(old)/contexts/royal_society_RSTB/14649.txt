the process of information transmission. Even if there were
ways by which such intervention could be avoided, it is
difficult to see, given the current state of Al and machine learn-
ing, that information transmitted could ever be free of external
influences. Worst case scenarios might involve malevolent
intervention such that algorithms that bias behaviour toward
goals that further the interests of particular political, cultural
or religious groups are enforced.

In suggesting a plausible route for evolutionary tran-
sitions between humans and AI devices, particular
importance has been placed on AI. Some might reasonably
point to the fact that AI devices are no different from other
kinds of technical objects [54-56], and thus arguments that
AI should be given special significance are misplaced, or at
least the scenario outlined above should be extended to
encompass other kinds of objects.

Humans have long-crafted tools: instruments for hitting,
such as hammers, being prime examples. Like AI, hammers
can be viewed as technical extensions of the mind [56]. Their
form and function stand, under certain circumstances, to
affect human fitness. Moreover, the design of hammers evolves
as a consequence of feedback among a range of factors, includ-
ing function, aesthetics, economics and utilityâ€”at the level
