work a step further, it was desirable that a detailed study should be made of records
from a large number of stations of a well-observed deep focus earthquake ; this has
been done in the present investigation.

Tn the earlier paper, it was mentioned that it should be possible to recognise a deep
focus earthquake from the records of a single station and to make an estimate of the
depth. A favourable opportunity occurred on February 20, 1931, when a disturbance
which was recorded at Kew Observatory showed quite definitely the abnormalities
associated with a deep focus. On the day that the shock occurred, and from the Kew
records alone, it was possible not only to locate the epicentre but also to obtain an
estimate of the focal depth. The information so derived was published in the Kew
Seismological Bulletin for February, 1931, and also in ‘ Nature.’} Reports subse-
quently obtained from other stations confirmed the fact that the shock was very deep
seated, so this disturbance has been selected for the detailed study and records from
a large number of stations have been examined.
