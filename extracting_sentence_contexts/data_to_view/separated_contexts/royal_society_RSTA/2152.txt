An analysis of the generating function P(q)
shows that ‘near’ primitive jth order roots of unity, the size is much smaller the larger j is. Thus,
the main contribution is from the pole at q = 1, secondary terms come from the pole at q = —1 and
the third order of contribution comes from the third order roots of unity. In fact, the explanation
of the terms in the expansion (1.2) is that the function Ej(1) is an approximation of the behaviour
of a suitable Cauchy integral near the primitive jth order roots of unity. As an illustration of this
numerical phenomenon, table 2 contains values of P(q) near roots of unity, where the columns
correspond to the different roots of unity ¢, and where the values of f in the rows correspond to
evaluating |P(¢ - e~')|. The exact description of P(q) near roots of unity is afforded by the modular transformation
properties of the Dedekind-eta function, for which

Essentially, n(t) is a level one modular form of weight 1/2, with a multiplier system consisting
of 24-th roots of unity.
