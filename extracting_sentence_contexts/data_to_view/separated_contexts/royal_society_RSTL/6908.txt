What I wish to point out is the probability of the continuance of
severe cold during the period when the high-level grayels were in course of formation,
with, at the same time, a concurrent gradual amelioration of the climate, accompanied
poxsibly by a greater rainfall, and certainly by great spring floods. I have before shown how impossible it would be for the present rivers, even during
their greatest floods, to attain a height at all approaching to the level of the high-leyel
grayels; but, taking the additional discharge resulting only from this melting of the snow,
independently of any larger rainfall, the floods must formerly have been far greater
than those of the same districts in the present day, and have given to the rivers for a
portion of the year a torrential character. That the water-supply was adequate to fill
at times the broad and s8hallow old channels is evident from the facts and is borne out
by calculation. The Waveney waters may, even now, when the valley is flooded, give a
sectional area of, 8ay 1400 square feet. 'To fill the channel of the old river, supposing
it to be on the level and of the width of the high-level gravels, would have only
required a volume of water of a sectional area not exceeding 7000 feet, or five times
as large. So with the Ouse, the measure, with the yalley flooded, may be 4000 feet
for the present river, and 20,000 feet for the old postpliocene river; for the Somme of
to-day 3000 feet, and for the old river 16,000 feet; and for the Seine 8000 feet now,
and 36,000 feet formerly.
