In the first exposure of the cloth the locusts had had
no such distraction for perhaps hours en route, and the black patch must have been a very
novel feature in the landscape for them. The results of these trials showed that migrants could not be caused to settle in appreciable
numbers by a black conspicuous object. More interesting, however, was the fact that many
did react to it as they passed over by hesitation and change of direction, soon corrected. Settling appeared to be merely an extreme form of the reaction to the same kind of stimulus. The question naturally arises as to whether such effects occur also on a much larger scale
when their importance would be correspondingly greater.
