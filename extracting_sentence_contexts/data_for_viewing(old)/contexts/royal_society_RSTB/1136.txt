ich those impulses spring.
‘2 It is otherwise with the material of this and the succeeding chapters; since
the electrical changes, now to be described, are evoked by the excitation either of the
Giferent parts of the cord itself, or its nerves. The method of determining the
— of the functional activity of nerve tissue, by the study of those electrical
ects which undoubtedly accompany and indicate the extent of that activity, is thus
& be now applied solely with relation to the cord.
E Since the functions of the cord are naturally divisible into those connected
pecially with its fibres—conductivity—and those connected especially with the
Ectivity of its cells, of which reflex action is the example, the present method was
plied in any given experiment with special reference to the elucidation of one of
ese two branches of enquiry, it being always borne in mind that, as a matter of
fact, the two groups of function overlap.

The question of the localisation of paths, in the fibres of the cord alone, has at
present been only approached in reality by the method of histological experiment,
including the embryological and degeneration methods, since previous physiological
observation, relying on movement as an index, has always included the whole of the
neuro-muscular mechanism.

The sole method for obtaining actual indications of the conduction of physiological
processes in the fibres of the cord, is that of determining the presence in them of
excitatory electrical changes. We have, therefore, carried out a very large number of
