It follows that, although the
“gevidence points towards a lower density for the sediments and a thinner crust, neither can
be regarded as definitely proved by the results at present available. However, sediment is
Zknown to be present from the seismic experiments, and the value T=20, R=174 km.
= agree better with the ratio of R/T derived from results of gravity surveys in other areas. A One is, therefore, strongly inclined to believe that the sediment has in fact a lower density,
é and that the crustal thickness is small. The reason why these results cannot be conclusively
B proved at present is because the structure of the continental shelf in this region is com-
& plicated by the presence of the local mass deficiency, indicated by the negative anomaly at

3 station no. 6, and the seismic and gravitational observations are not sufficiently detailed.
