For a series of curves
in which §, can be 5 and £, = 9,—or both, if we will—ten times these amounts,
it is idle to talk about the value of the Gaussian curve (6; = 0, 8, = 8) in describing
variation, These frequency curves can be actually obtained by experimental sampling,
although the process is laborious, and indeed were so obtained in the first place. *
They arise from observation and experiment. The remarkable point about them is
that they illustrate all the types we have been discussing and justify sharp transitions
in algebraic forms by showing that such transitions correspond to actual physical
facts arising from experimental statistical data. The whole illustration, details of
which will shortly be published, indicates the evil of implicit reliance on a classical
theory,

The Gaussian theory of error has, with great weight of authority, been applied to
determine significant differences in statistical constants. The theory of the
“probable error” must be justified in the case of each statistical constant to which it
is applied.
