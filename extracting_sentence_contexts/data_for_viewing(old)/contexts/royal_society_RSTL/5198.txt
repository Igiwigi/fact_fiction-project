WHEN I had the honour of laying before the Royal Society my former researches
-on the structure of the spinal chord, I intimated an intention of preparing another
Scommunication on the structure of the medulla oblongata and cerebellum ; but as
many important points in the minute anatomy of the chord till remained in obscurity,
=I thought it advisable to make them first the snbject of special inquiry, as far as the
=new method I employed would enable me to proceed. Moreover, as all investiga-
tions into the structure of any organ have, or ought to have, for their object a clearer
Sand better knowledge of its functions, I have undertaken also to communicate in
Ahis paper whatever physiological deductions may appear to follow from my observa-
Ztions. Having no particular theory to support, and being influenced in these inquiries
=Sby no other feeling than the simple desire to elicit truth, the greatest care has been
=taken to verify my facts, and caution has been exercised in drawing conclusions from
them.

Z It is a question of great interest and physiological importance, whether the roots
Â£of the spinal nerves belong exclusively to the spinal chord, or whether part of them
Hascend within either the white or the grey columns, and form the channels by which
Smpressions are transmitted to and from the brain. On account of its interest and
Smportance, I have employed much time and labour in endeayouring to arrive at
ome well-grounded and settled conclusion on this very difficult subject, having
Sdevoted to it alone many hours daily for nearly five months. So extremely intricate,
however, is the internal structure of the chord ; 80 numerous are the planes in which
Sthe nerve-roots enter the grey substance; and 80 various are the directions which
they pursue within it, that notwithstanding the perfect transparency of my prepara-
