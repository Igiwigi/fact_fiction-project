[This expression gives the value of each of the entries in the infinite determinant (xii.).

Now it is possible, by a certain laborious investigation which I do not here reproduce, to develope
this infinite “tidal” determinant in the form of a series, and then to show that, however close the two
masses may be to one another, the series arising from the tidal determinant can never vanish. It may
also be proved that the other infinite determinant, which results from “ rotational” terms, is necessarily
greater than the tidal determinant, and @ fortiori can never vanish. ]*

Thus it might be held that stability must subsist in the figures of equilibricm until the two masses

come into contact. But, as appears from § 11, it is certain that, if one of the masses be smaller than the
other, this cannot be the case. In fact, the investigation must break down on account of the imperfection
arising from the use of spherical harmonic analysis.
i We have seen that the infinite determinant, which gives the coefficients of stability, splits into two
parts when we rely on spherical harmonic analysis; but when instability ensues it must be brought
about by the joint action of the tidai and rotational forces. It appears certain then that, if a rigorous
analysis were used, this separation would not take place.

Although the present investigation proves thus to be abortive, I have thought it worth while to sketch
the process, because it almost certainly indicates the line that must be pursued whenever a more
rigorous analysis shall be applied to this difficult problem.
