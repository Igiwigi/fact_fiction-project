572 PROFESSOR OWEN ON FOSSIL REMAINS OF EQUINES

relative to both Tozodon and Macrauchenia supports and further illustrates the views of
their affinity indicated by the order in which their dentition is illustrated in my * Odon-
tography*®. In the present Paper I am enabled to adduce facts showing that the most ancient
known indigenous Equines of the South-American continent presented modifications of
the upper molars, and more especially of the lower molars, which supply an additional
link in the connexion of the singular group of Mammals formed by Toxodon, Nesodon,
and Macrauchenia with the Equines and the rest of the Perissodactyle order of Ungu-
lates. Concurring with Dr. LuxD in the swrmise that the Equines in question may, like the
Hipparionf or Hippotheres# of the Old World, show concomitant modifications of

limb-structure, I would propose the term Hippidiony for the group represented by the
Species neogaus, principalis, and arcidens. DBscRIPTION OF THE PLATES.
