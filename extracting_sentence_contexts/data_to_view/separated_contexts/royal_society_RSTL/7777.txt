The results to be obtained by the study of such sections may be divided into such as are
structural, throwing light on the physical conditions under which the meteorite was
formed, and such as are mineralogical and concern purely the particular minerals that

are the ingredients of the stone. From the former class, we learn that a meteorite has
had a history ; that it has undergone change subsequently to its first consolidation in its
present form. The crystalline character of all the constituent minerals; the fissures at
one time formed, then filled and then, in many cases, broken across and © heayed” and
filled again, like some mineral lode ; the © chondritic ' structure that G. Ros has llus-
trated*; the fracture, in at least one meteorite, of the spherular © chondra,” which have
been split and severed and recemented into a compact mass,—these are among the
many facts imprinted on a meteorite which are 80 many records belonging to its history,
and which by the aid of the microscope we may read and interpret. But to found a
classification on the structural characters of meteorites is not the same thing as to arrange

S them according to their mineralogical composition. The two must be combined for a
Z philosophical arrangement.
