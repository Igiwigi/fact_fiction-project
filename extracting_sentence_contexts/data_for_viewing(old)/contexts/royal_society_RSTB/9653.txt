statistical evolutionary genetics. The fact that they are easily
implemented both in a maximum likelihood and in a Bayesian
context may have given the impression that the choice between
these two paradigms is merely a philosophical one, mostly
depending on oneâ€™s personal stance with respect to the status
of priors and the interpretation of probabilities.

On the other side, more sophisticated models, involving
several levels of distributions, non-parametric priors, con-
tinuous-time processes, among other features, have been
progressively introduced and explored in phylogenetics.
Such models do not always have a clearly defined number
of parameters. Instead, as much as possible, they tend to
