ing parts of acid." :

The limit tothe 'decomposition of 8uper-oxalate of potash
by the above acids, is analogous" to that which occurs when
sulphate of potash'is decomposed'by nitric acid ; for" in this
case also, no quantity of that acid can take more than half the
potash, and the remaining salt is converted into a definite
sper-sulphate, similar' to that obtained by heat-in the third
experiment,

It is not improbable that many'other changes in chemistry,
supposed'to'be influenced‚Äù by a general redundance of some
one ingredient; may in fact be/limited by a new' order of affi-
nities taking place at some definite proportion tobe expressed
by a simple multiple. And though'the' strong power of crys-
tallizing in oxalic acid, renders the modifications of which its
combinations are '$usceptible more distinet than" those of other
acids, it seems probable that a" similar'play of affinities will
arise in $olution, when other acids" exceed their base in the
same proportion.

In order tg determine whether' oxalic acid is capable of
uniting to potash in a proportion intermediate between the
double 'and quadruple quantity of acid, I neutralized forty-
eight grains of carbonate of potash with thirty grains of oxalic
