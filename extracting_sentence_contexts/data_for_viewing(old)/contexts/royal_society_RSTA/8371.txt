tion, first in 2, and then in § of the fundamental property of a tetrahedral complex,
we can connect this property with the property of a normal rational quartic curve ¢,,
namely, that trisecant planes of c, meet any [3] in the lines of a tetrahedral complex
whose modulus is that of the parameters on c, of the four points in which the solid
meets C4.

Properties of Transformation.—lt is easy to see by projection from P that trisecant
planes of c, which pass through P form a quadric cone V,?._ This cone V,° is therefore
the locus of all the E-conics in § ; and any line of § meets just two E-conics. It is
clear also by projection that a line of S meets three chords of c,. Thus ‘Y-conics in
general meet ¢’‘ in three points and Q in two points. Similarly we find that to any
line of S through P there corresponds a trisecant line of $’,* ; and to any line meeting c,
there corresponds a line meeting $’,4 and Q. From these facts we deduce the follow-
ing: To any V3" of &, containing $’ as r-fold and Qas s-fold surfaces, corresponds a
Vs™-*—* of 8, having cy as (n — 2r — s)-fold curve and P as (n — 2s)-fold point.
We finish with four examples of the use of this theorem :—

Cubic primals through ¢’ -+ Cubic cones with fixed vertex at P, and passing through
C4.

Cubic primals through Q -> Quartic primals passing through P and having c as
double curve.
