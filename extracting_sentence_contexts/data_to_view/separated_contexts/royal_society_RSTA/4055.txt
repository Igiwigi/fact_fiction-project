The calculated free strains for the two cycles as a function
of the temperature are shown in figure 6a. In both cycles, the calculated effective free strains
are zero before gelation. This is due to the fact the resin is liquid, and consequently, there is
no permanent deformation nor residual stresses in the resin. In the one-hold cycle, during the
180Â°C hold, linear cure shrinkage of 0.7% is measured for the prepreg. As mentioned before, this
value only represents the cure shrinkage after gelation where the mismatch of free strains coupled
with modulus development results in permanent deformation of the beam.
