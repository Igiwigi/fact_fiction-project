ingly, the A-repeats were originally derived from ERVB4
endogenous retroviruses [9], and the ERVB4 sequences con-
tain two consecutive repeats that are also likely to form an
inter-repeat structure.

Identification of covaried base pairs is a classical method
for the detection of structures and furthermore suggests
functional significance. A recent study from Rivas et al. chal-
lenged the notion of structure conservation in IncRNAs using
rigorous statistical tests where phylogenetic effect on the covar-
iation is removed [59]. Analysis of the A-repeat region did not
yield statistically significant covariation support for any of the
fixed A-repeat structure models previously proposed. In fact,
the pattern of covariation indicates a large number of possible
pairings, consistent with the stochastic formation of alternative

structures detected by PARIS, which distributes and dilutes
the evolutionary pressure. Taken together, the PARIS,
icSHAPE and covariation analysis all support the stochastic
inter-repeat duplex model for A-repeat, making it the
best-understood region in the entire Xist transcript.
