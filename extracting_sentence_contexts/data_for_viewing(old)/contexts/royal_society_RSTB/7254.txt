At 35째 C 60% R.u. exerted a great desiccating influence on the recently hatched larvae
of X. cheopis and X. brasiliensis (table 25) ; growth, though possible in some of them, was not
enough to permit their successful development. Most of the larvae of X. brasiliensis died in +
the first instar; only a very few completed their active larval life, and these died without
cocoon formation and pupation. The growth of this larva at this humidity was significantly
poorer than at higher humidities. On the other hand, most of the larvae of X. cheopis grew
at 60% R.H., and died in different developmental stages; a few of them even spun cocoons,
and only those that remained within cocoons pupated. The growth was not simultaneous,
as all the three larval instars were found after 16 days. The development of the larvae
of X. cheopis at this humidity was significantly better than that of X. brasiliensis.

According to Mellanby (19324, p. 226, figure 4), all large larvae of X. cheopis died within
24 hr. at 60% R.H. with 34째 C. This is probably due to the fact that he had exposed larvae
without food. Subsequently, he (1933, p. 198) observed even that at 70% r.u. and 35째 C
the larvae of this species did not develop successfully. The fact that the larvae of this species
survived in my experiments under almost identical conditions of temperature and humidity
is possibly due to the better nutritive conditions.

Though 80% R.u. improved the larval developmental rate of the three species a good
deal at 35째 C, yet it exercised a desiccating influence. Owing to a great adverse effect of
this temperature on the larvae of X. brasiliensis (table 25), the drying effect of this humidity
