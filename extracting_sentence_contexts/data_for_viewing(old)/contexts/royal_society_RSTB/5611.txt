primary neuronic emigration outward to form a real cortex and a secondary one inward,
: it could not be properly said to be a derivative of the cortex and therefore pallial in
origin. Further, the pyriform lobe is described as separated from the general pallium
by the fissura rhinalis and from secondary olfactory centres, medially or ventro-
medially, by a fissura endorhinalis which becomes the fissura amygdala when it separates
the pyriform from the nucleus amygdale. After such a definite delimitation it is
difficult to understand how the origin of that complex may be adequately described
as the result of an infolding along the fissura itself. If such an origin were authentic,
it would mean that cells migrated from the matrix to the area of the fissure and then,
multiplying further, were folded in from the region of the fissure to form the various
nuclei of the complex: such a question can never be settled until the process of
development takes place before our eyes. Further, the fact that a new development
of nuclear masses in any part of the brain appears with a fibre system not found in
the phyla below, does not mean that the coincidence is the cause of the development
of the new nucleus. Rather, it demonstrates only a certain parallelism, in that a new
fibre system must of course have a nucleus of origin and one of termination, and in
that a hypertrophy of one generally indicates only that the other is large also.

This general criticism does not mean that after a complete survey of the nervous
structure of various members of the vertebrate phyla, greater understanding is not
possessed by the student, but it does imply that we know nothing about the cause or
influences which brought about the so-called change. Such a study does not offer any
solution of the problem why certain brains continue to develop past stages at which
others become permanently adult ; or why some remain embryonic longer ; or what
