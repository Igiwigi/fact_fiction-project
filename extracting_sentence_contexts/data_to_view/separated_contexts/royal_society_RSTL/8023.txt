In his tab, xi. fig. 1 he represents a radial longitudinal

V section in which three sharply defined vascular bundles, unaccompanied by any other

Â© tissue, proceed upwards and outwards across a field of vertical, barred vessels, which are

= disposed with rigid straightness and perfect paralleliem. I think I shall not be ven-

Z turing too far if 1 doubt the perfect accuracy of this figure. But what is of chief im-

A portance at present is the fact that he believes these yascular bundles to spring from his
inner or medullary rings of vessels, and not from any part of the outer or ligneous zone,
and that he discovers 20 traces of cellular medullary rays in his specimen. M. BRroxGNIARr, as we have seen, found a yery similar general arrangement in his
Sigillaria elegans, only in this plant the inner or medullary vascular cylinder was inter-
rupted, at intervals, instead of being a continuous ring.
