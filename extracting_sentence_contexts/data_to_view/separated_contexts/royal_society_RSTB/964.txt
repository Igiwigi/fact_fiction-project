The base of the triangle is formed by the curved wall ;
fundus, the apex is at the entrance of the cervix into the body of the uterus,

Bounding the mucosa on its outer side is an inner layer of muscles mostly consis
of bundles disposed in an irregular circular direction, they run more or less oblic
round the mucosa, but at so small an angle that I have called them circular mus
besides these, and enclosed between the bundles of circular muscles, are bun
longitudinal muscles; but these are not so numerous as the circular bundles in
inner layer. From the circular muscle bundles scattered fibres run radially inwards a
distance into the mucosa, they are not numerous and are irregularly placed, |
existence, however, prevents the mucosa being sharply marked off from the m
layer as Mrvor (47) describes for the uterus of the human female. i

Outside the inner layer is an external layer of muscles, chiefly composed of bu
of longitudinal fibres, but between them are smaller bundles disposed in a cire
direction. Outside the longitudinal layer of muscles is a thin layer, represented by a d
line in fig. 12, which is only superficially different from the external layer of mu
by reason of the fact that it does not stain so deeply. It is composed of scattered fibres of longitudinal and circular muscles, with a
connective tissue cells, the whole embedded in a gelatinous material, and coy
outside with a layer of flattened epithelium. I have called this layer the sheath.
