In §6a, we show that the Hamiltonian vector fields of the Flaschka—Ratiu system on AN
converge as f-> oo to the Hamiltonian vector fields of the action coordinates ¢. In §6b, we
prove that for t sufficiently large, the fibres of the Flaschka—Ratiu system intersect the chamber
AN, of matrices in AN such that the minors A” > 0 (one may think of this as the chamber of
‘totally positive’ matrices in AN). These facts are combined in §6c to prove proposition 6.1 and
theorem 1.2.

(a) Convergence of Hamiltonian vector fields

For! C {1,...,k}, let Ly be the linear function so that L(®, seey A) = Vie wo (cf. equation (2.3)). Recall also that forl,J C{n—k+1,...,n}, |I| =|J| =j, there exists a Laurent polynomial P/; so that
(3 K)
[ArP =Pi(A®, AM) x
(see equation (3.8)).
