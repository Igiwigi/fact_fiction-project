type specimens include two casts, one of the actinal and one of the abactinal surface,

of an Ophiurid which agrees with Fores’ description, and which were figured by
him, and, on a separate piece of rock, casts of the abactinal surface of a very different
species having opposite ambulacral ossicles. It is rather badly preserved, but in
those features which can be made out it resembles Rhodostoma leptosoma. GREGORY
re-described P. sedgwicki in 1896 (9), and correctly described the L-shaped ridges,
crossed by a groove, seen on the actinal aspect of the arms. It is curious that he
does not mention the fact that the specimens labelled as type specimens belong to
two different species, and that he gives a description of the ossicles at the distal
end of the arms. The distal ends of the arms are broken off in the specimens having
alternating ossicles ; the specimens having opposite ambulacral ossicles agree neither
with ForBes’ nor Grecory’s description.

Protaster sedgwicki, as represented by the specimens figured by Forxs, is an
Ophiurid with alternating ambulacral ossicles. The relative proportions of the disc
and buccal armature contrast with those of Lapworthura; while the diameter of
the disc in both species is 1‘8 mm., that of the circle formed by the apices of the
oral angles is 0°6 mm. in P. sedgwicki and 1:1 mm. in Lapworthura; on the other
hand, the form of the ambulacral ossicles is closely similar in the two species.
Gregory has considered a Y-shaped appearance of some of the adambulacral
