possible states). At any given moment, new copies of component automata may be generated.
In such a setting, which applies for modelling multicellular growth or protein bio-synthesis
of the constituents needed for multiple instances in a cell of a given metabolic pathway, etc.,
the notion of transient behaviour of any given copy of the system fails to capture the global
recurring instantiation of the full dynamics of the system arising in the behaviour of the ensemble.
Indeed, the same principle of adding copies of the system applied to a transformation semigroup
in each of its possible states allows all the possibilities and mappings in the semigroup to
be realized recurrently, without permanent loss in a transient. For every mapping s of the
semigroup, any set X stabilized by s (e.g. any natural subsystem where s acts) recurs in the
ensemble, so even after arbitrary time -s: X > X will realized. Thus, the entire semigroup
S with its space of dynamical possibilities (Q,5(A)) recurs indefinitely often. If one has a
good model for understanding its natural subsystems and the transitions between them,°”
this can be applied repeatedly, in spite of the fact that they may only occur transiently in a
particular component.

(b) Example 1 continued: cell cycle and multicellular differentiation

Let C be any finite automaton cell model including the cell cycle which results at some point
in division, for example using the simple cell-cycle model of [101] modelled as a Petri net in
figure 12.55 Here phosphorylated cdc-2 (cdc2-P) and cyclin oscillate in synchronization with the
cell cycle; in sufficient concentration cdc2-P sets off a cascade of events that results in the cell

*’This refers not only to scientific or experiential understanding, but also to hierarchical coordinate systems obtained by
Krohn-Rhodes decompositions, using say the partial order 2/’R of weak control hierarchy (as in theorems 6.1 and 6.2).
