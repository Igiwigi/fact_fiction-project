We note that the matrix A in (3.3) is Hermitian.
Non-trivial solutions of (3.3) are obtained by setting det(A) = 0, which yields

{[ mo? - 24e)(1 - cos(kL)) | [low*L - 4E)(2 + cos(kL)) — 144(E])? sin?(k1)}
~ 2 {hot [ma - 24E](1 - cos(kt)) |} =0. (3.5)

The equation above represents the dispersion relation of the system, which gives the
eigenfrequencies w of the structure as functions of the wavenumber k. When the spinners do not
spin (2 = 0), the dispersion relation has double roots. This is due to the fact that the cross-sections
of the beams have been assumed to possess the same second moments of area about the x- and
y-axes.

(b) Dispersion curves

We assume that the beams have Young’s modulus E = 210 GPa, length L = 6 m and square cross-
section of side length 0.1 m, as in the example of §2a. For the gyroscopic spinners, we take m=
1kg, Ip = 20kg m? and I, =10kg m?. The solid lines in figure 5a—d represent the dispersion curves
of the system for different values of the gyricity 2, specified in the caption. In the same diagrams,
the dashed lines are the (double) dispersion curves of the system when the spinners are rigid
bodies with mass m1, rotational inertia Ip and zero gyricity.
