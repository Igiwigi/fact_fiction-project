THrorEM XXXV (K) :—In order that a steady motion with vanishing second curvature
of a holonomic conservative system may be stable in the kinematical sense, it is necessary
and sufficient that the roots of the determinantal equation (7.684) should all be purely
imaginary and that (7.689) should be true.

A particular case of special interest, where the variables are separated, may also be
considered. We shall adopt a semi-geometrical point of view.
In the classical discussion of vibrations about equilibrium, the infinitesimal quadric,

(7.69) V,,, dq" dq" = constant,

plays a fundamental part. In fact, it is necessary and sufficient for stability that this
quadric should be of the closed (or ellipsoidal) type, the independent normal vibrations

taking place along its principal axes. In the case of vibrations about a state of motion
there is a corresponding quadric of importance to which we shall now proceed.

Being given a trajectory, let 4 be any point on it with co-ordinates q” and let B be
any neighbouring point in the manifold of configurations with co-ordinates (q" + &’).
Consider the locus of the point B (A being fixed) if
