introduced by graft or inoculation, it produces a fatal top necrosis. In Irish Chieftain
it combines with the A virus latent in this variety to produce a very mild crinkle, from
which the plant may ultimately grow free.

THE MEDIUM OR X# sTRAIN

At the same time as the G strain was obtained by selective inoculation from the
green portion of the leaf tissue of an X-infected tobacco plant, the Z strain was obtained
by selection from the yellow portion of the same leaf. It will be shown that neither
selection was, in fact, at first pure, but each was so largely composed of the G or L
strains respectively as effectively to mask the presence of others.

The L strain of the virus, for which it is proposed to employ the symbol X*, when
pure is characterized as follows:

In tobacco, variety White Burley. No local lesions are formed; systemic infection may
show itself under glasshouse conditions on the seventh day, though more usually about
the tenth. The first symptom is the clearing of the veins on the leaves next in succession
to those on which the inoculation was made. The main and secondary veins become
chlorotic and the smaller ones to a lesser degree (fig. 7, Plate 18). Later, the chlorosis
fades and a yellow mottle appears at the apex of the leaf. The yellow areas, which are
small and more or less rectangular, are bounded by dark green bands alongside the
