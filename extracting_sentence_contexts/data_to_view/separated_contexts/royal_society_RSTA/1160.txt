Here, A is a pre-exponential, t is a decay constant and f is time. See the electronic
supplementary material for more details and for descriptions of various control experiments. It is worth noting that while the STCP analyses performed here were conducted on a single,
select ROI, an inspection of the electronic supplementary material videos shows that CAPs were
in fact initiated and launched from each vacuum-specimen interface, or lamella edge, following
in situ photoexcitation. This indicates that the direction of CAP propagation is not dependent
upon crystallographic orientation. Instead, acoustic-phonon launch from morphological features,
such as step-edges and interfaces, is hypothesized to arise from a rapid dephasing of directional
phonon modes due to inherent differences in the interfacial boundary conditions at such features
and the associated influence on the lattice response following photoexcitation [6].
