Having extremely low absorption in the near-IR spectral region, silicon is even more attractive
in the nonlinear regime [23-25]. Previously, we have shown that MD modes can substantially
improve the nonlinear response of silicon nanodiscs [26,27] and their oligomers [28,29]. Apart from the fact that the MD mode is often the lowest-order mode of a high-index
subwavelength spherical or disc-like nanoparticle, it remains unclear whether there is any further
advantage of using this mode for nonlinear conversion processes when compared with ED or
higher-order modes. In this paper, we compare the nonlinear effects produced by optically isolated silicon
nanoparticles being pumped at their ED and MD resonances, by employing third-harmonic
generation (THG) spectroscopy technique. As depicted schematically in figure 1a, we observe that
exciting the MD resonance leads to a large THG yield compared with the case of ED resonance
because of the stronger field confinement within the nanodisc for the MD resonance.
