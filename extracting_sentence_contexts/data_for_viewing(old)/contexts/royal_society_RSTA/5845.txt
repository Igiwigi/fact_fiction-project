which follows from setting Q = 0 in (2.10).

In the following, we need not consider the whole class of areal coordinate representations, and
instead, we find it sufficient to restrict to the special class for which Q is constant in both space
and time but not necessarily zero; we refer to these coordinate systems as Qconst.-areal gauges. In
fact, we further specialize to Qconst.-areal gauges that are obtained from a Qo-areal gauge in one
of the following two ways:

(1) Choose Q € R, fix arbitrary non-vanishing 417, a2; in R, and set

Then it follows from (2.12) that

and moreover, it can be shown, for Jx 4 0, that
