the radio-activity. During the daytime ascending currents are formed, while as the
evening approaches these stop and the air lies cold and stagnant during the night.
Thus we see why the minimum should be in the daytime and the maximum during
the night. fe

The yearly period has a similar explanation. During the winter in Karasjok, when
the snow is permanently on the ground, temperature inversion accompanied by
stagnant air is the rule rather than the exception. On the contrary, during the
summer when there is nearly permanent sunshine, ascending currents will be formed
at all times of the day and night. This accounts for the winter maximum and the
summer minimum of the radio-activity.

One strange fact is that the activity should be so high during the winter when the
whole country is covered with snow. This at first led me,t with other observers, to
doubt Exster and Gerretâ€™s theory, but the reason is not hard to find if it is
remembered that the snow must form a very large reservoir to hold the emanation as
it is escaping from the soil. It would be interesting to see if air, drawn from the
; snow in the way Ersrer and Gerret drew it from the ground, would be charged
with emanation. I wished to test this, but had no instruments with me which could
be used for the experiment.

One would also expect high values of the radio-activity in ek during the
winter from another consideration. Karasjok is situated on the river, and just as the
water from all the surrounding land flows down to the river, so when the temperature
falls very low the cold air will also find its way into the river valley. This cold
