the large areas with low-intensity circulation blood flow in the LAD branch appear (see figure 11,
time points 1, 3 and 4). From a hydrodynamic point of view, the appearance of such nontrivial
features of fluid flow is explained by the change in the geometry of the blood vessel after stenting
(figure 1c).

Another feature of the vessel bifurcation site both before and after stenting is the most intense
blood flow through the sector III (Out2) at almost all time points, which provides a stronger blood
flow. This circumstance is associated with the fact that the inhibitory factor for fluid flow after
stenting is the appearance of a circulation flow near the stent in the LAD branch and, in general,
the intensity of blood flow in the sector II, therefore, changes little.

Also, before stenting (figure 10) at time point 2, the blood in the LAD branch (sector II) moves
in a retrograde direction and flows into the DA branch (sector III), acquiring normal movement.
At this time moment after stenting (figure 11), the blood flow in all arterial branches becomes
retrograde (oppositely directed), which qualitatively agrees with the data in figure 9.

In figures 12 and 13, the distribution of shear stresses at different time points of the cardiac
cycle are shown before and after stenting. The first important thing is that the characteristic values
of the shear stress in the bifurcation area after stenting have decreased by several times compared
to the shear stress before stenting (see the colour scales used). Also, note that the DA branch
