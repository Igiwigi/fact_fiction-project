On plotting the values of the modulus of rigidity against the corresponding
temperatures a straight line was obtained. From this line the value of the modulus
at 0° C, was found by exterpolation and then the true temperature coefficient « was
determined. The value found was # = ‘0002543, where m = %)(1 — at). The value
of n at 15° C, was found to be n,, = 8°4517 x 101! dynes per sq. centim., from which,
for the sake of comparison with the values for the other wires, the “ coefficient” 8
was obtained, 8 = 0002552.

In determining the modulus of rigidity of the second steel wire with the later form
of apparatus, use was made of the fact that it had already been found to be a linear
function of the temperature. Observations were therefore taken at two temperatures
only, and from these the temperature coefficient was determined. :

The following are the means of several determinations at the temperatures given.
