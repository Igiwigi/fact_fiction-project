lines were then used as standards in measuring the remaining lines of the spectrum
from plates taken with pure Hydrogen tubes. The plates were measured on a Hilger
travelling micrometer, with a screw-pitch of 1 mm. and reading by a vernier on the
drum to 0-001 mm. Three plates were measured for each region, each plate, following
the usual procedure, being measured in both directions to eliminate personal errors in
setting. Each series of readings so obtained was repeated before altering the position
of the plate on the stage of the micrometer. The two values rarely differed by more
than 0-003 mm., and their mean was adopted in subsequent reduction. In all,
twelve settings were made on each line, except in the case of some of the faintest lines
which were not visible on all the plates; these exceptions have been noted in the
tables given.

The reduction of micrometer readings to wave-lengths was simplified by the fact that
the dispersion was almost exactly 10 A per millimetre. In the region 16560-24860
the readings were reduced to approximate wave-lengths by the addition of a constant,
and the final adjustment was made from an error curve drawn either by means of the
iron standards or the Hydrogen standards prepared from them. In the blue and ultra-
violet regions a preliminary linear correction was applied so as to reduce the slope of
the error curve. The arithmetic mean of the six values calculated in this way was
adopted as the final value. The wave-lengths and wave-numbers in vacuo have also
been tabulated, the corrections for this purpose being taken from the tables of Meacers
and Perers (‘ Bureau of Standards Publications,’ p. 698, 1918).

For all but a few of the weakest lines and a few diffuse lines the probable error of
the mean wave-length adopted was less than 0-02 A, and for most lines it was consider-
