independent of the dip of the fault and is only determined by the position of the top of the
freely slipping part. As long as this position remains the same, then there is an infinite family
of strike-slip faults with different dips and surface traces that will give the same short-term
deformation field. For a thrust or normal fault, the dip of the freely slip part, but not the locked
part, has an effect, although this is relatively small for low-angle faults. So, for a deforming wedge
above a decollement that is freely slipping at depth—for example a subduction megathrust or
thin-skinned thrust belt or low-angle detachment system—the short-term deformation is only
controlled by that part of the system that is moving on this timescale. To make the point even
more strongly for the Central Andes, it is not possible to tell from the forearc short-term shear
strain rate alone (figure 4a) whether or not there is a rapidly slipping dextral strike-slip running


along the forearc; in fact there is not, but instead a very weakly active normal Atacama fault,
despite the compressional interseismic stress loading.

(b) Stress loading and stress relief in the earthquake cycle

In essence, the earthquake cycle is an irreversible process resulting in the conversion of reversible
elastic strain into permanent finite deformation. Although the elastic straining part of the cycle
may be smooth and two-dimensional, as in the New Zealand plate boundary zone, the details of
finite permanent deformation may be complex. This is well illustrated by the ruptures during
the 2016 M7.8 Kaikoura Earthquake in northern South Island, New Zealand which involved
slip on over 21 different faults [66], www.geonet.org.nz), fragmenting or smashing a volume of
crust about 170km long by 30km wide by 30km deep, subparallel to the locking line on the
megathrust and associated contours of short-term stress loading (figures 7a and 8, [16]). This
