D. Henry A stark illustration of the severe complications inherent
e-mail: d.henry@ucc.ie in the fully nonlinear governing equations is given

by the remarkable fact that there is only one known
explicit solution of the exact governing equations for
two-dimensional travelling gravity water waves, the
celebrated Gerstner’s waves.

Gerstner’s wave is a two-dimensional nonlinear
periodic travelling wave propagating at the surface
of a fluid of infinite depth with vorticity (see [1-3]).
Perhaps due to its highly prescribed and idiosyncratic
flow properties, Gerstner’s wave possesses a storied
background; indeed, in no small part due to Lamb’s
objection that Gerstner’s wave is rotational and hence
cannot be generated by conservative forces, it has
