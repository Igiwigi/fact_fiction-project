E. Cates et al. In planning the meeting, the organizers were mindful of the fact that high-
precision experimental work, often involving direct particle imaging, has shed
new mechanistic light on both sides of the granular/colloid divide, highlighting
similarities as well as differences between granular and colloidal dynamics. An instance is in the formation of separate regions of static and flowing material
under homogeneous stress conditions to create ‘shear bands’. In dry granular
flows, these are usually microscopic (a few grains across) whereas for colloidal
systems they are often macroscopic (occupying a substantial fraction of the width
of the sample cell).
