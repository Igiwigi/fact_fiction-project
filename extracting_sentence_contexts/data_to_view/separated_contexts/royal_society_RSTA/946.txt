Indeed, this implies that preserves the :
homology classes of y and jz. on each ‘narrow’ torus. Therefore, if we set x = ©*x in the definition nee)
of the actions I(H, F) and I,(H, F), then I(H, F) = I(H, F) and I,(H, F) =1.(H, F). | 72

Note that due to analyticity it is sufficient to compare the actions only on the family of ‘narrow’ : a
tori, although I and I are defined on the whole neighbourhood U(yp). :S

Remark 5.5. In fact, we do not even need to mention H and F in the statement of theorem 5.4 [8
at all and can equivalently reformulate it as follows: . Consider a singular fibration with a parabolic orbit yo which is Lagrangian with respect to two
symplectic structures 2 and $2. Suppose that 2 and & induce the same orientation and the same
coorientation of yp.
