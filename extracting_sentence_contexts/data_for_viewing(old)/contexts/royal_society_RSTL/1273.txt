circumstances, there can be no doubt ; yet the two are not in-
discriminately mixed ; for when the egg has been previously
boiled, the yelk, though softer than natural, is. nevertheless
rendered of a firmer consistence than the modified albumen,
and can thus be readily separated from it; there is, moreover,
a distinct line of demarcation between them, arising, appa-
rently, from the proper membrane of the yelk, Another
argument in favour of the opinion of the intermixture of the
albumen and yelk at this period, is derived from the following
analyses of these constituent principles of the egg ; from
which it will be found, that the quantity of the saline matter
is diminished in the albumen, and increased in the yelk. It
is a singular and striking fact, however, that although the
oily matter of the yelk has made its way to the albumen,
very little of the phosphorus, which exists in such large
quantities in the yelk, has been removed with it.
