and w = 4sin* (q/2) IR|P-?. Using (3.5), their phase 6 satisfies consequently

q ~ tan (4) =6(2z). (3.15)
Using the values of @ and v computed from the numerical simulation, we get q~ 2.142 from
(3.15) and R ~ 0.34 from (3.14). Figure 3 compares the three resulting analytical approximations
to the outcome of the numerical simulation. The relative error between numerical solution
and analytical approximations (supremum norm for t â‚¬ [862,882], normalized by the breather
amplitude) is 11.6% for the Gaussian approximation (3.7) (blue curve), 11.8% for the compacton
(3.13) (green curve) and 13% for the compacton (3.11) (black curve). The error on the travelling
breather amplitude is much smaller, 0.024% for the Gaussian approximation (3.7), 1.3% for the
compacton (3.13) and 3.4% for the compacton (3.11). The comparison is thus quite satisfactory
given the additional errors induced by the determination of parameters 6 and v and the fact that
the moving breather has not yet reached a fully steady regime. A more precise comparison will be
