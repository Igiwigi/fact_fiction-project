If permanently small, there is stability. As simple examples we may quote
the great circles on a sphere as illustrating stability and the straight lines on a plane as
illustrating instability. There is anlimportant fact (easily deducible from the calculus of variations) in the case
where the order of the disturbed curve is infinitesimal. It is that if O*O is perpendicular
to C, then so also is P*P, where P and P* are any pair of corresponding points. In con-
sidering stability in the action sense it is in general sufficient to consider only cases
where O*0 is perpendicular to C ; thus we may say that there is stability in the action
sense when every point of the disturbed geodesic is adjacent to the undisturbed geodesic.
