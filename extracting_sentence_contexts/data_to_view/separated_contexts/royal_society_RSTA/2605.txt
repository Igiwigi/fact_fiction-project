The labour involved
would be considerable, and very little additional information would result. What is
more important is to examine the conditions which our solution implies at the surface
of the plate. Our boundary condition (49) requires that wv, shall have the value unity at all points
on the plate ; if in fact the solution makes u, equal to (1 + e) at any point (< being
a quantity which varies with «), it is inaccurate to the extent that at this point it
implies a velocity (of the fluid relative to the plate) which is given by — <U, and
accordingly is up-stream when ¢ is positive.* Fig. 8 shows the variation of 1, as
