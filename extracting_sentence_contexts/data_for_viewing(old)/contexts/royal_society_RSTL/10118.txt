at once show that, if for a given weight of saltpetre, 16 mols., the carbon and sulphur
of the mixture were allowed to increase, the volume of gas generated by combustion
would likewise increase, but the quantity of heat will grow smaller, and if the carbon
and sulphur be diminished the gas will also become less, but the heat of combustion
will increase.

NoBLE and ABEL have called attention to the fact* that the products of heat and
gas obtained by them in their various experiments with different descriptions of
powder do nob differ much from each other. The explanation of this interesting
observation is to be found in equations (IX.) and (X.).

The work which can be performed by a given weight of powder will, ceteris paribus,
be proportional to the volume of gas and amount of heat, respectively, which the
powder can produce by its combustion, and hence, will be proportional to the product
of both. This is, however, only approximately correct, because, if we have to compare
the work which two powders of different composition can produce, the gases given oft
by the one will not contain the elements in the same proportion as those produced by
the other; a portion of the energy developed will be consumed in the performance of
interior work during the expansion of the carbonic acid. This portion is, however,
