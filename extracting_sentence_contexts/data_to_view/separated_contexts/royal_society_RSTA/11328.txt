After this division, subtract the first column from the 5th, 6th, and 7th. The determinant reduces to
one of the 9th order; subtract the first column of this new determinant from its 4th, 7th, and 8th

In this case R = 1 — Vy — Th — Ti2 + 2723772, and we have

Rn = 1 — th; Ry = 1 — rs, Rs = 1— 7,
Res = Tate — Mx, Ra = "2123 — "1s, Re = Pass — M2,
