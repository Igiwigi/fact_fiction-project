(fig. 1.) and the wire in the circuit, as two bodies of the same kind and acting upon
the same principles, as far as the first inductive phenomena are concerned, notwith-
standing the different forms of discharge which ultimately follow*, as we may com-
pare, according to CouLons's investigations√û, different lengths of different insulating
bodies required to produce the same amount, of insulating effect.

1332. This comparison is $till more striking when we take into consideration the
experiment of Mr. Harris, in which he stretched a fine wire across a glass globe, the
air within being rarefiedf. On sending a charge through the joint arrangement of
metal and rare air, as much, if not more, electricity passed by the latter as by the
former. In the air, rarefied as it was, there can be no doubt the discharge was pre-
ceded by induction (1284.); and to my mind all the circumstances indicate that the
same was the case with the metal; that, in fact, both substances are dielectrics, ex-

hibiting the same effects in consequence of the action of the same canses, the only
variation being one of degree in the different substances employed.
