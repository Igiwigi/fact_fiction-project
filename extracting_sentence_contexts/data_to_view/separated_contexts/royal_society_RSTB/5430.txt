158 W. H. LANG AND I. C. COOKSON: SOME FOSSIL PLANTS OF

The information obtained as to a particular type of vascular strand and tracheidal
structure extends, but does not fundamentally affect, our previous knowledge. The
same may be said as to the specimens of Sporogonites Chapmani, although the discovery
of further specimens of this general type in a new and distant locality is itself a fact
of great interest. On the other hand, the discovery of a new species of Zosterophyllum,
as determined by the fructification, is not only of interest for the same reason, but
because it has led to a completion and deepening of our conception of the morphology
of this type. Not only do the specimens of Zosterophyllum australianum enable us to
picture this fructification in the solid, but they have led to a fuller understanding of
the corresponding region of Zosterophyllum myretonianum.
