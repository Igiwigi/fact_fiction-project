interval enclosing (y, 8) in its interior, and exceeding it in length by an arbitrarily
small amount.

It is evidently a necessary condition for uniform convergence that the function
should be continuous in (y, 8).

§18. After what was said in the preceding paragraph, it will be clear that,
when lim s,(s) exists as a finite number at a point of the open interval (0; 7), all

a>o

the canonical Sturm-Liouville series corresponding to f(s) converge at this point, and
have the value of this limit for their common sum. We may employ this fact to
obtain conditions under which these series converge.

Let (s), the bilateral limit of f(s) at the point s, exist as a finite number. In
virtue of (35), it is easily seen that

s.(8)-o (8) 2+ [LA (8-04 fi (s+ )-2e () SOIR at . (36)

Let us now suppose that, as 8 diminishes indefinitely, the integral
