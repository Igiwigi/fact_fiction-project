If this hypothesis, however, of a disproportion between the
loss of water produced by evaporation, and the inadequate
compensation afforded by the ingress of rivers, be founded in
fact; and if this deficiency be replenished by the saline waters
of the ocean, it will be necessary to explain why the waters
of the Mediterranean do not gradually increase in saltness,
and indeed how it happens that they are not ultimately con-
verted into a saturated brine. It has been supposed, in order
toremove this difficulty, that an under-current of water, salter
than the ocean, runs out of the Mediterranean at the Straits

of Gibraltar, and unloads its waters of their excess of alt. But however plausible this theory may be, it must be con-
fessed, that scarcely any other argument has hitherto been
alledged in support of the probability of this under-current,
than the easy explanation it would afford of the phenomena,
and analogies derived from the familiar fact of opposite atmo-
spheric currents formed in confined places, from the mere
admission of air of a different temperature.* The following
fact, however, for which I am indebted to Dr. Macmicnarr,
who had it from very respectable authority (the British Consul
at Valentia), seems to give considerable support to the above
theory. Some years ago a vessel was lost at Ceuta, on the
Coast of Africa, and its wreck afterwards thrown up at
Tarifta, on the European shore, full two miles west of Ceuta.
