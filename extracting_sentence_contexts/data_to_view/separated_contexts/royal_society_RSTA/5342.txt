Although the system Hamiltonian can be chosen freely, we will for definiteness
focus on a two-level system. In the basis of its eigenstates, the system Hamiltonian
is diagonal, with matrix elements 0 and ¢. The system—bath interaction causes
dephasing in the excited state, and V has matrix elements 0 and de(X), where the
fact that de is an operator on the bath degrees of freedom is indicated explicitly
by the notation (X). Phil. Trans.
