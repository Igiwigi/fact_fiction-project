from the side of the denser to that of the lighter gas. Indeed, from the manner
in which these phenomena, have been for the most part described, it would appear

a larger volume of the lighter gas passes, the phenomena are generally deseribed as
if the current were from the lighter to the denser gas. These phenomena of transpiration, like those already considered, may be shown to
follow directly from the theory. But as has been already mentioned in Art.
