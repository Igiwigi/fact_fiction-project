With regard to the knowledge of the nature of the different
substances, as they exist in the primitive astringent infusion, we
can gain, by our artificial methods of examination, only very
imperfect approximations. In acting upon them by reagents,
we probably, in many cases, alter their nature; and very few
of them only can be obtained in an uncombined state. The
comparison, however, of the products of different experiments
with each other, is always connected with some useful conelu-
sions ; and the accumulation of facts with regard to the subject,
must finally tend to elucidate this obscure but most interesting
part of chemistry. I. EXPERIMENTS ON THE INFUSIONS OP GALLS.
