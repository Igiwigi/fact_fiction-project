The fossil Matonidium was probably indusiate, and the
appearance of some at least of the species referred to Microdictyon points undoubtedly
to the existence of an indusium; the occurrence of fertile pinnse of Laccopteris in
which the outline of the sporangia are distinctly shown, is no proof that an indusium
was never present. In an older leaf, which had been exposed to the air before being
; embedded in sediment, the circular indusium might very readily fall off. The fact,
therefore, that in some of the specimens referred to Microdictyon the sori appear to be
indusiate, does not in itself afford an obstacle in the way of uniting Saporra’s
Microdictyon to Laccopteris (including Phlebopteris). Specimens conforming to the Laccopteris (Microdictyon) type have been recorded
from Jurassic and Cretaceous rocks of England,** Germany, France, Portugal,
Belgium, Austria, Italy, Russia, Bornholm, Switzerland, Australia, and elsewhere. It is probable that the fragments of a fern described by HeER*+ from the Cretaceous

Phiebopteris.
