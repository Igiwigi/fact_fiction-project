2322. If one magnetic pole only be employed the effects occur near it as well as
before, provided that pole have a face large in proportion to the bar, as the end
of the iron core (2246.) : but if the pole be pointed by the use of the conical termi-
nation, or if the bar be opposite the edge of the end of the core, then they become
greatly enfeebled or disappear. altogether; and only the general fact of repulsion .
remains (2295.).

2323. The peculiar effects which have just been described are perhaps more strikingly
shown if the bar of copper be suspended perpendicularly, and then hung opposite and
near to the large face of a single magnetic pole, or the pole being placed vertically,
as described (2246. 2263.), anywhere near to its side.
