The same result may be obtained by employ-
ing a prepared frog reduced to two half-thighs of unequal length attached to a piece of
the spine. This same proposition leads us to explain the fact discovered by M. Du Bots REYMOND,
namely, that a current is obtained by touching with the plates of the galvanometer
the central points and the edge of the same transverse section of a large muscle. In
fact, the central points belong to the longest muscular fibres, and therefore play the same
part towards the points near the edge of this section belonging to the shortest fibres, as
the interior of a muscle towards its surface. 134 PROFESSOR MATTEUCCT'S ELECTRO-PHYSIOLOGICAL RESEARCHES. I take this opportunity of calling attention to a fundamental difference existing between
a muscular electromotor and a voltaic pile.
