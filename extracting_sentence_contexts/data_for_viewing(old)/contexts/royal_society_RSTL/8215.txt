It is only when the hxes pass from one plane into a cond perpendicular to it, as happens in orthose,
heulandite, and other minerals, that any change takes place in the relative positions of the axes corresponding
to the red rays with regard to the axes which correspond to the blue.

+ Under the same cireumstances Montebrasite of Hebron and Montebras presents a horizontal dispersion in
combination with a well-marked inclined dispersion. The phenomena to which those different kinds of
dizpersion give rise in the coloured rings aro described and figured in my © Memoire sur Vemploi du
microscope polarisant,”” im the © Annales des Mines * for 1864, tom. vi. 6th series,

bly oblique form of this mineral can, in fact, only be established in an incontestable
nanner by the obliquity of the cleavages p and m on the plane perpendicular to that in
yhich the optic axes lie, because this obliquity is absolutely incompatible with a
linorhombic form, in which the plane of symmetry would be perpendicular to the
lane of the optic axes and to the bisector of their acute angle, in which, furthermore,
he twisted dispersion would be very strong.
Heat changes the angle of separation of the optic axes by diminishing it in a
ensible degree. A plate only slightly oblique to their plane gave in air for the
ed rays = h
