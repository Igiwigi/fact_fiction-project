to the wall velocity, as obtained by a full DSMC simulation and by a hybrid simulation when the
DSMC region extends over a mean free path away from both walls (@ = 0.2) and the buffer region
is 0.149 wide. A good agreement between the two profiles is found as can be seen from the inset
of figure 3a, where the relative error, defined as

upsme(x/H) — ii(x/H)

AUG /H) = itpsmc(x/H)

, (3.1)
is plotted. The largest error, in fact, is below 2%, whereas, in the case of a full LBM simulation
(orange dots in the inset of figure 3a), a 5% error is found to occur within the Knudsen layer. This
result is obtained strictly maintaining mass conservation within the system. In figure 3b, in fact,
the instantaneous number of particles present in the DSMC region is compared with the averaged
