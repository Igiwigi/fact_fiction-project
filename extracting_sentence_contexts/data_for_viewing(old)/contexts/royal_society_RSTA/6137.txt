xX=gradg, ie. xj =Gi;- (2.3)

In light of the connection (2.2) and recalling that tr grad = div, it is seen that x is purely deviatoric,
ie. x = x. Here, the divergence operator on rank-2 tensors operates on the second component,
ie. (div s)j = si;.

For a linear elastic CS material, we have the constitutive law

w=CGx,

where ¢ > 0 is a characteristic length related to the microstructure and G is the rank-4 tensor of CS
moduli possessing the major symmetry property gjjxj = gxj- Immediately it appears that, to any
effect, 4 may be replaced by zn? and, in fact, the CS theory is said to be indeterminate based on
the observation that the first invariant of the CS tensor, ie. tru = - 1 = 11 + 22 + 433, remains
indeterminate. Therefore, we are free to set it equal to zero without any loss of generality, i.e.


Siikl = Ski = 0. In the following, for the sake of brevity, we shall write ~ with the understanding
that bP is meant. For isotropic materials, we have

w=2GH7(x +X"), OF SiR =ZG(5jSix + N5jK5i1), (2.4)
where —1 < 7 <1 isa dimensionless number similar to Poisson’s ratio.
The equilibrium equations, in the absence of body forces, read ([28], eqn (2))
