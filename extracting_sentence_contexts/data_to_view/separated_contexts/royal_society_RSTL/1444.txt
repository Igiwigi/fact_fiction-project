But is it inconsistent with the general
laws of nature, or even with the animal ceconomy, that from
their combination they should have a different action, and
thus an additional use ? To illustrate this we need only wit-
ness the action of almost any set of muscles in the body ;
for example, in liſting a weight, the combined action of the
muscles of the arm, shoulder, and chest, is different from the

S ; individual action of either set, or of any individual muscle; or
J an instance nearer our purpose may be adduced, viz the ac-
5 tions of the muscles of the chest and belly, making a com-
S pression upon the viscera, as in the discharge of urine, feces,
IK &e. But to question this fact would be to question the influ-
I ence of the will in any one of the almost infinite variety of
5 motions in the human body.

= I presume, therefore, it will be admitted that we have the
= same-power over these muscles of the eye as of others, and I
'Z believe we are no less sensible of their combined action ; for
Z example, after viewing an object at the distance of halfa mile, if
= we direct our attention to an object but ten feet distance, every
Z person must be sensible of some exertion ; and if our atten-
= tion be continued but for a short time, a degree of uneasi-
& ness and even pain in the ball of the eye is experienced ;
65 if again we view an object within the focal distance, 7. e. within
= 8x or seven inches, such is the intensity of the pain that the
z exertion can be continued but a very short time, and we again

relieve it by looking at the more distant objects ; this, I be- *
lieve, must be the experience of every person, whose eyes are
in the natural and healthy state, and accordingly has been
observed by almost every writer upon optics. But the power of this combination, even from analogy,
