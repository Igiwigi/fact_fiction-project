cerca swarms from the westernmost point of Africa (south of Agadir) to Portugal and Spain
in October 1945. She suggested that the high temperature over the land at the point of
origin enabled the swarm to rise to 1500 to 2000 ft., where there was a 30 m.p.h. southerly
wind capable of carrying them to Portugal in the time available. She suggested that their
estimated average speed of 23 to 28 m.p.h. could not have been achieved at the surface
because the wind there was generally less than that speed. It should be pointed out,
however, that if the locusts were oriented down-wind they might have maintained the
necessary average speed even at the surface. Moreover, if they were down near the water

in daylight in a wind too strong for them to make headway, they probably would in fact
be orientated down-wind, especially if dense enough for gregarious re-alinement to
occur.

Bearing in mind that swarms have been said to average only 20 to 30 miles a day over
land, Waloff suggested that it was simply the act of flying high in the rapid wind which
enabled the locusts to cover so great a distance in one day or so. Another reason that may
be suggested for the locusts flying so far and fast was that they were over the sea, and not
over land. It seems probable that the high temperatures over the land enabled the locusts to
rise high and so cross the coast, but there is no evidence that they remained high throughout
their long journey. The locusts were reported in Portugal mainly near the coast itself. They
were flying now southwards, against the wind. This also suggests they were low before
reaching land and had changed their behaviour on arrival over land simply because they
