275 In Eechinus miliaris the writer (1926, p. 267) showed that genital 3 arose as a prolifera-
tion of the right postero-dorsal spicule, and that genital 5 was similarly formed from
the right post-oral spicule. The fact that plate y in Echinocardium cordatum is formed
from the same larval spicule as is genital 5 in Eehinus miliaris seems to prove that plate y
is indeed genital 5. The small spicule lying anterior to the anus (a.) is undergoing resorption and will soon
disappear entirely. If it is assumed that plate y is genital 5, the arrangement of the
ocular and genital plates around the central anus recalls that found in a regular urchin
such as Hehinus.
