In this way, the attempts to hold space for indiscernible entities seems to lead
either to entities without identity or to entities with a non-trivial identity. The common point is that
in both cases it seems necessary to go beyond set-theoretic foundations in order to cope with
indiscernible entities. That being said, the scope of this comparison is limited by the fact that
the corresponding notions of indiscernibility are not necessarily the same. Whereas the notion
of non-individual was forged to deal with quantum indiscernibility, the canonical example of
indiscernibility formalized by homotopy type theory is the indiscernibility between two path-
connected points in a space. It is also worth noting that the project of going beyond set-theoretic
foundations in order to hold space for indiscernible objects does not depend on any ontological
thesis about the ultimate nature of the corresponding indiscernibilities.
