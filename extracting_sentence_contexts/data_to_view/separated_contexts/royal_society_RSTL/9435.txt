SECTION I.

1. The general question to which an answer is sought in what is called the Theory
of the Comparison of Transcendants may be stated thus :—

1s it always possible to establish, between the values for different variables of the
integral of an algebraic function however complex, algebraic relations: the variables
themselves being connected by any requisite algebraic laws ?

1f, for example,

[Xdr=F(ﬆ)

where X is any algebraic function of &, rational or irrational, integral or fractional, is
it necessarily possible by connecting z,, 2, . . . z, by any requisite algebraic laws to
obtain an algebraic (or logarithmic) expression for the 81m

This question is 8uggested on the one hand by such well-known results as

F(z;)+F(z,)=constant, where K=— = if 0;*+ag=1
MV iz

and

F(z)+F(2)+F(z,)=0 where X= ———

if

4(1=2/)(1—2g)(1—ag)=(2=af—af—a +Pufxgx,)?,

and on the other hand by the possibility of finding algebraical expressions for many
symmetric functions of the roots of equations though these roots may not separately
be 80 expressible. It is in fact this combination of the theory of integrals and the theory of equations
which furnishes the key to the problem ; enabling us to express the requisite algebraical
laws very concisely by a single equation of which the variables are roots, and whose
coefficients are not independent but connected by a corresponding number of relations.

2. The expression of the function to be integrated. To escape the inconvenience of fractional and irrational forms we first introduce two
new functions and a fresh variable.
