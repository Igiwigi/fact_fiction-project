Another experiment was made with nineteen eggs in a single cell, by pin-head

application of the fluid, and eleyen of these were fecundated and began to be seg-

Smented in three hours and forty-two minutes, and ultimately produced embryos, the

$5 remaining eight being sterile. Some of these failures were probably due to the cir-

5 cumstance that the fecundatory fluid was not applied to the most susceptible part of

= the egg, yet the general results sufficiently show not only that fecundation is more

2 surely and quickly effected at a moderately high than at a low temperature, but also

Fthat it is 80, more or less certainly and quickly, in proportion to the amount of

S influence supplied. S These facts lead us to some further consideration of the results of the application

= of definite quantities of the fecundatory agent to the egg, as affecting the develop-

= ment of the embryo, and possibly also as influencing both the evolution of its physical

E structure and p$ychical condition. TI have little hesitation in believing that whatever

E be the precise nature of the influence communicated by the fecundatory agent to the

i egg, that it is only after full and complete impregnation that perfectly normal and

YZ healthy embryos are formed, and ultimately attain to the maturity of the species.

= And yet we have already seen that when there is great ezcess of the agent, either

5 that no embryo is produced, or that its development is not completed. Q A few days after making the Jast-mentioned experiments I repeated them with
another object in view, and then obtained a result which bad occurred on previous
occasions, but being less distinctly marked had been almost overlooked.
