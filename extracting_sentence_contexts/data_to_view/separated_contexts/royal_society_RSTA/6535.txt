Obviously, in nature, or
for complete physical robots, the ability of an individual to survive or reproduce
will depend on a number of factors that are related in a complicated manner to
that individual’s performance on a range of related and unrelated tasks. For the
purposes of our simplified model here, however, it is reasonable to assume that all
other factors are equal across the population, and consider it to be a sufficiently good
approximation to take a simple linear relation between our single task-fitness function
and the survival or procreation fitness. In fact, any monotonic relation should result
in similar evolutionary trends, but it is very easy to lose weak effects in the noise
of the rather coarse simulations forced upon us by current computational resource
imitations. Given that, initially at least, we were aiming to replicate effects that arise in biolog-
ical evolution, it was appropriate to follow a more natural approach to procreation,
mutation and survival than has been used in many evolutionary simulations in the
past (see, for example, Belew & Mitchell 1996). If, as is often done, we were to train
each member of the whole population for a fixed time and pick the fittest to breed
and form the next generation, there would be no incentive for individuals to learn as
quickly as possible, and efficient learners would not evolve.
