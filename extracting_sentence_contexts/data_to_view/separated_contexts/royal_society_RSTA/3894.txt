Under low Fe
conditions, Fe mass balance required increases in the biogenic Fe pools (figure 4; electronic
supplementary material, tables S4 and S7) associated with krill (28x), producers, copepods
and microzooplankton (approx. 15x each), and bacterioplankton and carnivorous zooplankton
(approx. 5x each). The necessary adjustments were slightly less pronounced under high Fe
conditions (electronic supplementary material, tables S4 and S7), requiring approximately 24x
biomass increase for microzooplankton, 10x increase for producers and approximately 5x
increases for krill, copepods and carnivorous zooplankton (electronic supplementary material,
tables S4 and S7). The fact that, in both models, the biogenic pools with the highest required
increases were those of krill, producers, copepods and microzooplankton might be due to the
small magnitude of both the lower and higher Fe content values for these functional groups
(kg Fe t-! wet weight; table 2; electronic supplementary material, table S2). Many of these Fe
content values are derived from studies (see Material and methods, ยง2) in stringent trace metal
laboratory conditions, and thus only include intracellular Fe content. If some of these organisms
have a significant amount of bioavailable Fe on their body surfaces, this extracellular Fe could
be a significant source of Fe for their consumers, explaining part of this discrepancy.
