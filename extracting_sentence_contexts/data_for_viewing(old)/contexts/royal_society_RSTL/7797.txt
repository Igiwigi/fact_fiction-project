moxst of its allies in a similar manner. Two, if not more, such instances will at once
occur to every ornithologist. They are those of the Capercally (Tetrao urogallus)
and the Great Bustard (Otis farda). In both these birds, T believe, the disproportion in
Size between the sexes is not greater than in the remains of the species now before
the Society. But then another idea is called up: Tetrao urogallus departs from the
usual habits of the Tetraonide by being polygamous ; and (though IT am aware that the
statement has been disputed) the same is 8aid to be the case with Otis farda. Indeed IL
am inclined to suppose that with all species of birds the practice of polygamy is accom-
panied with more or less disproportion in the size of the sexes, Whether the converse
js true T am not in a position to declare.” —Proc. Zool. Soc. 1865, pp. T6077:

The strongest objection that seems possible to the suggestion here thrown out is in
the fact recorded by LxGvar, that the male birds of the Solitaire of Rodriguez assisted
the females in the work of incubation ; but the question of its polygamy or monogamy is
not likely to meet with a solution now.

From the amount of variability which every portion of the skeleton of this species
aisplays, it may not unreasonably be supposed that as much was exhibited in those parts
of its structure which have perished, even if we had not LeGvar's direct evidence as to the
individual difference in plumage among the female birds. There would accordingly have
heen abundant room for the operation of any such process as that which has been de-
scribed under the names of © Natural Selection” and © Suryival of the Fittest” to have

operated; and it may therefore appear at first sight, there having been known to us only
