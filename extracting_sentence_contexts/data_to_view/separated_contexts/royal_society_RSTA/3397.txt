To evaluate integrals of the type in the right-hand member of (119), when the
value of F(0,¢) is given by the table of § 56, or any similar table, we treat the
integral as a double sum, ¢.g.,

ats cath ee =)¥(2 mn) ‘mr Hi) - nT.
= (2) 2 (3 36° 36 (008 35 i 4 baat

then we have to evaluate such a double sum as

Tl 35
ne mT nm
> ( sin? —

36° a ae BY feces Pa
m=0 n=1


GRAVITATIONAL STABILIFY OF THE EARTH. 235

We sum first with respect to m; but in forming the sum we take account of the
fact that sin*(n/36) does not change when x is replaced by 36—n. For example,
let F be equal to 1 at the points indicated in the table, and zero at other points. Then the contribution to the terms containing any m of the two parallels given by n
and 36—n is either 0, 1, or 2, according as a 1 occurs on neither parallel (for the
particular m in question), on one, or on both.
