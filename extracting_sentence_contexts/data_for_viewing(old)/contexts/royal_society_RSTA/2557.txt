all three, peaks reduce between 19 and 28%. The base flows between these peaks saw minimal
impact from any intervention.

Figure 4 also shows that, through attenuation of the hydrograph, these interventions are :2
impacting the time water levels remaining above the downstream outfall. The smallest peak : =
(1st February) sees the greatest impact—with all intervention combinations reducing the time : Ss
the downstream outfall is inundated (which in the plain calibration was 7.25h). The north and : =
east interventions reduce this period by 30 and 90min, respectively. The south intervention : =
has a substantially larger individual impact, causing a reduction of 2.75h. Two sub-catchments 3S
have a wider range of improvement—reducing the inundation period to between 2 and 5h Lo
(the most effective being the east-south combination). When all three have interventions, the 18
model suggests that inundation is removed entirely. However, the two later peaks (on 7th and : s
15th February) do not see such positive impact. In fact, the attenuation of the larger peaks 18

means that inundation durations are either unaltered or even prolonged slightly. The model
suggested the largest intervention could prolong inundation from the middle and largest peaks
by 45 min.

A series of seven design storms (all of which cause downstream outfall inundation) were also
generated using FEH catchment descriptors and run through the coupled model. This was done
in order to gain a better understanding of the impact of NFM on this catchment across a wider
range of storms. Figure 5a compares peak reductions to changes in inundation duration for five
separate storms with tree planting and woody debris present across all three sub-catchments
simultaneously. This intervention lessened peak magnitude for the 10-year storm by 57% and
also reduced the inundation by 3.75h. The impact on peak flow for the 15-year storm is similar,
