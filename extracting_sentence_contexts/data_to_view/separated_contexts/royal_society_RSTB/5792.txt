The range of pigmentary response is not reduced by blinding. Nevertheless,
the organs of vision do play a very active and hitherto unsuspected part in the chromatic
responses of the chameleon. The most generalized fact about colour response in amphibia, fishes, and even
crustacea is that these animals respond to a light scattering background by melano-
phore contraction, and to a light absorbing background by melanophore expansion.*
It is curious that among the modern workers in reptilian colour change only one has
sought for a similar background response in reptiles. Rreprreip (1918) observed that
Phrynosoma cormitum became very dark on black cinders, and very pale on white
sand. The reaction in each experiment took several days to reach a maximum.
