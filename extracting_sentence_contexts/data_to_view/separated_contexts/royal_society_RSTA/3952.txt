In the scale of fig. 1 27/A) is very near to 0. It appears that long
waves have the greatest amplitude; practically the same amplitude is maintained
onwards through the visible spectrum, and in fact till we approach to wave-lengths
comparable with the diameter of the molecules. ยง 33. The measure with which we are concerned, however, is not amplitude, but
integral energy through ranges of wave-length.
