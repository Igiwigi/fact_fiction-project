exclusive to SSCs and no marker or combination of faithful expression of JacZ and GFP transgenes
markers has produced a pure population of SSCs. (Yeom et al. 1996; Yoshimizu et al. 1999). The
Also, while FACS and MACS sorting followed by Oct-4—GFP mouse is a valuable tool that enabled
transplantation are powerful tools for characterizing FACS-based isolation and transplantation of Oct4
the cell surface phenotype of SSCs, this approach expressing germ cells from a heterogeneous testis cell
has limited utility for characterizing cytoplasmic or suspension (Ohbo et al. 2003; Ohmura et al. 2004).
