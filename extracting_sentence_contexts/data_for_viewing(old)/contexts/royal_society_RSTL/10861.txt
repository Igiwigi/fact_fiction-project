= $53. Comparative Efect of Sudden and Gradual Changes of Magnetising Force,
& and Resultant Effects of Cyclic Changes of Magnetising Force.-â€”-It has long been
BD well known from the experiments of Vox WALTENHOFEN * and others that when a
Ss magnetising force is suddenly applied the induced magnetism is greater than when
E the force is gradually applied, and that when a magnetising force is suddenly
& withdrawn the residual magnetism is less than when the force is gradually withdrawn.
My own experiments afford many confirmations of these facts, but they show that in
very long uniformly magnetised rods the difference between the effects of sudden and
the effects of gradual changes of magnetising force are not great. Thus, in the
ballistie method, the difference in effect is not very material whether we produce a
change of magnetising force in a series of numerous steps, or in a single step. The
former process gives slightly, but very slightly, less total change of magnetism than
the latter. And in the magnetometric method the magnetisation produced by raising
the magnetising current continuously by means of a slide was found to differ but
little from that given by a 8udden establishment of the same current. The differences,
