Determination of combining weight of hydrolysed substance “A” by titration. It was recognized that if hydrolysed Substance “A” is a hydroxy-tricarboxylic
acid and if Substance “ A” is the lactone corresponding to it, then considerable difficulty
might be experienced in preparing a sample of perfectly pure hydrolysed “ A,” because
of the ease with which hydroxy acids of certain types are known to revert to the lactone. This difficulty was further intensified by the fact that hydrolysed “ A” was known to
cling tenaciously to the solvent when a mixture of ether-light petroleum, which is the
best crystallising agent, was used in its preparation. An attempt to overcome this
difficulty by using chloroform as a solvent instead of ether gave the same result since
hydrolysed “ A ” clings to chloroform as tenaciously as to ether. The problem therefore
resolved itself into that of finding a method of removing the solvent from hydrolysed
“4” without at the same time removing water and hence re-forming Substance “A.”

A sample of hydrolysed Substance “A,” free from solvent of crystallisation, and
containing a minimum of re-formed Substance “ A,”’ was finally obtained as follows :—
The air-dried sample of hydrolysed Substance “ A,”? whether recrystallised from ether-
light petroleum, or from chloroform, was dried at 60° C. at atmospheric pressure.
