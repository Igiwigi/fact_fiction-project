Nevertheless the agreement of the results in this series is not satisfactory. In experiments 4 and 6 the thermometer was falling both in the first and last
period, and the cooling correction was consequently somewhat large ; on the other
hand the lag of the fulling thermometer would affect both the first and last period,
and, therefore, be partly eliminated in the result. Experiment 5 is rendered a little uncertain by the fact that the thermometer at
the beginning of the first period fell slightly, and then remained perfectly stationary ;
it is therefore probable that the temperature was really increasing at the beginning of
the experiment. The cooling correction, calculated on the assumption of no rise,
would be too large, hence the calculated equivalent too small. The result of March 8th
is anomalous, and does not seem altogether accounted for by the sticking of the
thermometer at the end.
