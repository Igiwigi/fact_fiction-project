With the extent of degeneracy which is apparent it is not
surprising to find that this epithelial strand is not invariably present, and does not
always, when present, actually join the nodule.

3— Time of Appearance

If these nodules represent milk teeth one would expect to find some indications of
their enamel organs in younger stages, but such is by no means the case. The milk tooth ‘‘dv” is already present in the youngest specimen in which any
differentiation of the dental lamina has occurred (specimen X), and it would be
reasonable to suppose that any other milk teeth in series with “dv” would also show
some sign of their presence at early stages, certainly as soon as the permanent enamel
organs have been formed. Yet, far from this being so, these epithelial bodies do not
appear until late stages of development: in specimen H.N. only one nodule is present
in each jaw, and the nodules in fact appear only when the corresponding cusps of the
permanent teeth are well formed. Finally, if these bodies represent a series of vestigial milk predecessors, they would
almost certainly develop in order from before backwards. But it is found that, with the
more rapid growth of the anterior cusps of the teeth, the nodules “dx,” and “‘ dy,” are
present at a stage when “dx,” is only just commencing to differentiate (specimen H.J.).
