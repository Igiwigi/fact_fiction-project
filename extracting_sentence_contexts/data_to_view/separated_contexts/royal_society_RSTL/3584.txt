' DThe papers, as left by their author, and com-
mitted to me by his father, contained little more than a record of the observations. I have arranged them to illustrate certain general facts, and have added some of the

communicating his researches to the Royal Society, I believe I am fulfilling the design
with which, not long before his death, he was preparing them for publication.â€”J. P.
