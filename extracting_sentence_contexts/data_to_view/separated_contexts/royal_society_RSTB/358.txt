This growth in the gelatine appeared after about three weeks in the first inoculation
from broth, but on subsequently inoculating from this gelatine-culture in gelatine
again, the growth was more rapid, appearing in from ten to twelve days. This gelatine-growth appears as a transparent, smooth, shining, thin greyish expan-
sion on the surface, which slowly increases in thickness, and causes a depression with
gradual liquefaction. On microscopic examination, the growth was found to consist of
small bacilli, often hanging together in pairs, in fact their appearance was intermediate
between that of the bacilli from broth on the one hand (fig. 2) and from the nitri-
fying solutions (figs. 1 and 3) on the other. Fig. 4 represents the appearance of the
organism taken from a gelatine cultivation.
