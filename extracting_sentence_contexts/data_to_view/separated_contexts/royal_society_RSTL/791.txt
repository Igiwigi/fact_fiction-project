acquires that texture, which fits it, when extravasated in
living animals, to open a communication with the general
circulation, and by that means become a part of the solids of
the animal. It has ever been a desideratum to ascertain in what manner
blood after it had coagulated, and remained at rest in different
parts of a living animal, is rendered vascular. The fact itself has
long been known to every enquirer into the operations of the
animal economy, and several theories have been formed to ex-
plain it. Mr. HunTER, who perhaps understood theappearances
such coagula put on, when injected from the neighbouring
vessels, better than any other physiologist, was unable to
trace a direct continuation of ramifying branches from the
circumference of the living parts to the centre of the coagu-
lum, and therefore referred it to a principle of life existing in
the blood, which principle was consequently inherent in the
coagulum, and formed a series of vessels, pervading every
part of it, which opened for themselves communications with
the surrounding vessels. Since Mr. HunTER's time, no more
satisfactory opinion has been advanced for the explanation of
this curious phenomenon.
