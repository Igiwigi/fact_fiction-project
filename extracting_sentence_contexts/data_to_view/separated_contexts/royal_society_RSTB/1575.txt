nob inclided the genera Liielodus and Cryptopterus in which only two or three
xpecies are af present known to possess degenerate air-bladdars, Tn certain of the preceding genera the condition and relations of the air-bladden,
aud the character of the correlated skeletal modifications, are sufficiently well known
to admit of comparison with those dissected by us, Such» comparison clearly proves
that many of the former exhibit. structural modifications of an extremely interesting
churacter, On the other hand there are others of which scarcely anyilving is known
beyond the bare fact that the bladder is more or less rudimentary and encapsuled by
bone, and no data are available for comparison with other and better known types. Of the Hypostomatinw about which any reliable evidence exists as to the structure
and relations of the air-bladder and Weberian mechanism, we may first of all refer
to a series of genera which in future we shall term the Loricaroid types ; wader this
head we include Lomeuia, Plecostomus, and Calhehthys, There ore certain points with
regarl to these types which are still obscure, and wiore particularly the structure of
that portion of the internul ear which is specially related to the Weberian mechanism,
bot certain facts may, nevertheless, be nretrtioned ax affording a basis for comparison,
on the one hand, with such 8. abniormales as we have been able to examine, and on
the other, with such extremely modified forms as Acanthieus and Hypophihalmus.
