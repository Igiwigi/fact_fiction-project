Or are they simple bodies not metallic in their own nature,
but capable of composing a metal in their deoxygenated, and
an alkali in their oxygenated tate ?

These problems, the second of which was stated by Mr.
CAveNDIsn to me, and the last of which belongs to Mr. Brr-
ZEL1Us, offer most important objects of investigation.

I have made some experiments in relation to them, but as
yet unsuccessfully. I have heated the amalgam of potas-
sium, in contact with both hydrogene and nitrogene, but
without attaining their metallization ; but this fact cannot be
considered as decisively for or against any one of these con-
Jectures.

I mentioned in the BAKERIAN Lecture for 1807, that a modi-
fication of a phlogistic chemical theory might be defended on
the idea that the metals and inflammable solids, usually called
s}mple, were compounds of the same matter as that existing in
near to a metal in its characters, $0 that the metallic nature of steel does not mili-
tate against the reasoning in the text, The only facts which I am acquainted with,

that do militate against it, are the metallic characters of some of the sulphurets and
phosphurets of the imperfect metals,
