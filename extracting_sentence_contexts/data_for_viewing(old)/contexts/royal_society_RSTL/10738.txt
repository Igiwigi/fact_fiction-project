the alteration of resistance at 100? C. is for the load employed about 2 per cent.
greater than at 12* C. Tt is, however, when we come to Experiment IL, that the most
noticeable changes are seen to be produced, and when we consider the results recorded
in this experiment and in Table XXII. we are led to the conclusion that the tem-
porary alteration of susceptibility to change of resistance from changes of stress
effected by raising to 100* O. is, with nickel, as remarkable as we have seen this
susceptibility itself to be. The curves are drawn on the same scale as the curves for
nickel at 22? C., and it will be observed that not only is the maximum diminution of
resistance lessened by raising to 100? C. to an amount which is less than one-half of the
maximum diminution at the lower temperature, but that also the load ab which this
maximum diminution occurs is much less ; and it may well be that ab a snfficiently
high temperature the decrease of resistance which is observed to be produced by
moderate loads at the lower temperatures would be changed to an increase. In fact,
I am inclined very strongly to believe that there exists with all metals a eritical
temperature below which temporary stress will produce temporary decrease of resist-
ance, and that above this temperature there is an opposite effect caused by the stress.

The value of © Young's modulus” was determined for this piece of nickel by the
method of static extension, in a manner to be presently described, and was equal to
2480 x 106 at the temperature of 16? C. and to 2280 X 10% at the temperature of 100* C.
It will be observed that the maximum decrease of resistance as shown in Table XXILL.,
is appreciably greater than the maximum decrease observed with the other specimens,*
and still further shows how the amount of this decrease depends upon the elasticity.

As regards the question whether the thermo-electric properties of the metals, as
