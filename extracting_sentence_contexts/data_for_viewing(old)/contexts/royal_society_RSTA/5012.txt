The first experiment Faraday discusses in the paper demonstrates simple induction and is
worth describing here. First, 26 feet of copper wire were wound round a wooden cylinder as
a helix. Insulating the individual spires and preventing them touching each other by a thin
interposed twine. Then the wire coil was covered by a layer of muslin (a thick cotton fabric,
also called calico—the name commonly used at the time, including by Faraday). Next a second
copper wire was wound on top of this. This process was repeated until he had 12 coils of wire,
all insulated from each other. He then connected the free ends of all the even coils to make one
continuous length and likewise with the odd coils. He now had two helices, the ends of one of
which he connected to a galvanometer (a device invented a few years earlier to detect the presence
of an electric current) and the other to a voltaic battery.

15 December.

At first, Faraday saw no response from the galvanometer when switching on the battery, but
by experimenting with longer coiled wires, different materials for the conducting wires and more
powerful batteries he was finally able to induce a small reaction in the galvanometer needle,
deflecting one way on switching the battery on and the other when disconnecting it. We now
know this effect as electro-magnetic induction — in the sense that changes in the electric current in
