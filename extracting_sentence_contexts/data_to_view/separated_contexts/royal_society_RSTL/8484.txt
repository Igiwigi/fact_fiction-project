The most important fact demonstrated by this experiment is that the conjoint removal
of the frontal and occipital lobes exercises no effect on the powers of voluntary motion
or of sensory perception. The results of the post mortem examination indicate that the phenomena of the 8econd
day are not to be regarded as the effect of the remoyal of the frontal lobes as such, but
as due to the inflammatory complications which resulted in death. But the fact that for many hours after the operation the animal continued to retain
its powers of sensation and of volition, proves that these faculties are independent of
the frontal and occipital lobes, and that they are associated with those parts of the brain
which, by other experiments, I have shown to be specially related to sensation and
motion. What the positive effects were, as distinguished from the merely negative, it would
be difficult to state in exact terms. 'They are quite in accordance with experiments
already related as to the effect of destruction of the frontal lobes. Without entering further into the psychological aspects of these results, I would 8um
up the conclusions which seem to me to be legitimately deducible from them as follows: â€”

(1) Ablation of the frontal regions of the brain which give no reaction to electrical
irritation is without effect on the powers of sensation or voluntary motion, but causes
marked impairment of intelligence and of the faculty of attentive obseryation.

(2) Destruction of the grey matter of the convolutions bounding the fissure of Rolando
causes paralysis of yoluntary motion on the opposite side of the body, sensation remaining
unaffected, while lesions circumscribed to special areas in these convolutions, previously
localized by the author, cause paralysis of yoluntary motion limited to the muscular actions
excited by electrical stimulation of the same parts.

(3) Destruction of the angular gyrus (pli courbe) causes blindness of the opposite eye,
the other senses and yoluntary motion remaining unaffected, 'This blindness is only of
temporary duration, provided the angular gyrus of the other hemisphere remains intact.
