It should be
distinctly understood, that in all the experiments mentioned in this Postscript, except
the first part of experiment 28, single cells only were used. Upon the theory of the experiments 29 and 30 I will venture no positive opinion. That gaseous hydrogen should abstract oxygen from hydrogen, without the latter
forming any other combination, is a fact 80 novel, that any attempted explanation is
likely to prove premature. If, contrary to the views of Darrox, we suppose that
gases when mixed are held together by a feeble chemical affinity, then we may say
that the affinity of the nitrogen or carbonic acid for hydrogen produces the effect ;
the affinity of the oxygen of the water, being balanced between the hydrogen in the
liquid and that in the tube, would enable the resultant feeble aflinity of the nitrogen
for hydrogen to prevail; but on this supposition, why does not oxygen produce an
analogous effect? Its tendency directly to combine with platinum may indeed be
regarded as an opposing force, but this tendency is by many considered hypothetical.
