of the tissue adjoining it, while the sporangia conjoined into a firm framework do not materially alter in

120 PROFESSOR F. 0. BOWER ON THE MORPHOLOGY

The Gleicheniaceze have only sporangia laxly disposed round the central receptacle ;
in the Schizzeacez the sporangia are solitary ; in the Osmundacev their arrangement
leaves ample room for this mechanical opening. Finally, in Lorsoma, the sporangium
is so constructed with its incomplete ring that though the dehiscence is median, still
the sporangium as a whole does not widen on dehiscence. — It is, in fact, a compromise ;
with its basipetal sorus it retains the median dehiscence, but the annulus is so modified
as to be still compatible with that type of sorus; the half of the annulus is mechani-
cally ineffective, and the median rupture is maintained at the sacrifice of much of the
propulsive power. Thus it appears that in all known cases of median dehiscence,
excepting Loxsoma, the lax grouping of the sporangia is such as to allow of successful
mechanical ejection. ;

The dehiscence by an oblique lateral slit, worked by an oblique annulus, is found in
Matonia, Cyatheaceze, Dicksoniew, and Hymenophyllaces ; also in a modified degree
in the Dennsteedtiinee, and some others, and in the Plagiogyria section of Lomaria.
With the exception of the last-named genus and Matonia, all the Ferns showing the
oblique dehiscence have basipetal sori, and a constant orientation of the sporangia on
