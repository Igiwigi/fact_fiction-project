2. Nonlinear resonance in the context of image processing, visual perception
and dithering

(a) Image processing

As it is generally the case, the concept of image filtering with nonlinear resonances was first
introduced with one-dimensional signals and is mainly based on the SR property: adding an
appropriate amount of noise enhances the response of a system to a coherent information
excitation. However, motivated by the fact that adding this optimal amount of noise in real
system is not an easy task, parameter-induced stochastic resonance (PSR) has then been proposed
as a convenient solution to take benefit of the noise enhanced property in the field of signal
processing [29,30]. Later, the concept was extended to two-dimensional signals in the image
processing field. In fact, the underlying strategy of PSR consists in changing the intrinsic
characteristic of a nonlinear system to induce a cooperative effect between the input excitation
and the noisy nonlinear system.
