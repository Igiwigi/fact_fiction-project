Even in a tree 100 metres high the pumping
action represents a comparatively feeble vital activity, bearing in mind the fact that
a seedling may expend so much energy as to produce 1 per cent. and a fungus
6 per cent. of its weight of carbon dioxide per day. A single human heart doing
30,000 kilogramme-metres of work per day would be able to pump up all the water
required by six trees 100 metres high, the relative weights of the man and the trees
being approximately 1:5000. It is, in fact, the feeble intensity and diffuse
character of the pumping action in the stem of a tall tree, coupled with the
immediate disturbance of the conditions in the vessels when they are opened, which
renders its direct demonstration so exceedingly difficult. Summary. The physical conditions in the vessels interpose no obstacle to the exertion of
a pumping action on their contents controlled by the medullary ray cells.
