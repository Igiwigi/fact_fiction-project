The percentage of nitrogen in the different soils, ab the different depths, will be
recorded and considered in detail further on ; but ib will be of interest briefly to
notice the general bearing of the results in this place. Although the percentages
(determined by soda lime) in the samples collected after a lengthened continuance of
the drought in 1870 differ in 8ome respects from those on the samples of 1876, the
two series agree in showing, at every depth, a higher percentage on the ammonia-
plot than on the unmanured, and, with one slight exception which may be accidental,
a lower percentage in the soils of the nitrate than in those of the ammonia-plot,
especially in the lower layers, where it is lower also than in the case of the unmanured
plot, and indeed than in that of the majority of the other plots. That the upper layers of the soil of the ammonia-plot should show higher percentages
of nitrogen than those of either of the other plots is consistent with the fact that the
nitrogen of ammonia-salts is, in the firsb instance, in a great degree arrested in the
upper layers of the s0il, and is 80, much more than is that of nitrate of 8oda ; and that
the percentage should be also higher in the lower depths than without manure indi-
cates, presumably, a gradual percolation of the supplied nitrogen in some form. With
the rapidly distributing nitrate of soda, and with it the more deeply penetrating roots,
there is, on the other hand, a less accumulation of nitrogen, not only in the upper but
in the lower layers; and that the percentage should decrease 80 rapidly in the lower
layers is probably partly due to passage upwards in dry, and, in greater measure,
drainage downwards in wet, weather. Thus, it has been shown that in the drought
more water passed upwards from the lower layers, and it would donbtless carry with
it nitrate in 8olution ; and with the greater solubility of the nitrate, and the greater

disintegration, and consequently greater permeability of the snbsoil under its influence,
the loss of the supplied nitrogen by drainage would be the greater.
