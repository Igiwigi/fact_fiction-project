This amounts to saying that for a ring configuration in the Northern
Hemisphere a sufficiently high northern polar vortex stabilizes a configuration at a given latitude. In particular for N > 7, a stable configuration is only possible for a sufficiently high positive Imp. Similarly, we have the corresponding situation for the Southern Hemisphere when the southern
polar vortex is sufficiently high, i.e. for sufficiently negative values of Imp—due to the fact that
Typ =—N — Ip. The scenario becomes richer and the analysis more complex when the polar vortices are left
not fixed at the poles. In this case, the Hessian of the Hamiltonian has off diagonal terms.
