At the same time, the energy flux in the incoming wave is completely reflected. It is clear that
there are no period-averaged energy fluxes between the waveguide and oscillator (since in the
steady-state regime considered, the oscillator average energy is unchanged). This fact is reflected
by the —1/2 phase shift; see equations (3.11) and (3.17). The phase shift in forced oscillations and
associated waves has been recently considered in [15].

4. Discrete—continuous structures subjected to dynamic loading

In the recent paper [15], forced waves were considered in a master body equipped with a dynamic
sub-structure or in contact with an ambient medium.
