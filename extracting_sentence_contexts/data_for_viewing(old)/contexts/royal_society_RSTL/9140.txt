for 8nch things to be found there and nowhere else in the world, they replied that on this
point they really were incompetent to judge, but that, at any rate, many things as
strange had more than once happened before, as in the case of the elements cxsinm,
rubidium, and lithium, three out-of-the-way things found all together in one mineral
water, and the mineral gadolinite, which presented many curious problems which no one
had yet fathomed. However, they added, * We always measure out our belief according
to the evidence, and you are mistaken if you imagine us to be speaking over-confidently
on such a subject.”

Now we certainly cannot say that any Laputian chemists were placed in the position
or reasoned in the way we have described; but we may say that if they had been placed
in this position and reasoned thus they would have reasoned correctly, and their reasoning
would have been fully justified by facts.

This argument is greatly strengthened by the numerous analogies connecting the
elements y and xz. It is impracticable at this stage of our inquiries to bring these pro-
perly forward ; but the reader will hereafter have the conclusion forced upon him that the
element » is, 80 to say, but a less potent carbon. At, any rate, pursuing this train of
thought, I have, as I must frankly confess, been brought to the opinion that by far the most
probable explanation to be given of the anomalies presented by the densities of the
binoxide and tetroxide of nitrogen is that the two gases which pass under this name are
not homogeneous gases at all, but in each case are constituted of two gases which, taken
together, are made up of the matter of oxygen and nitrogen, but which separately are
not 80 made up. This is undoubtedly a speculation ; but it is not a mere speculation,
but one founded upon reasonable grounds, which explains difficulties for which no other
