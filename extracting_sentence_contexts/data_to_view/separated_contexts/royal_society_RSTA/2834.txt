These sources could be the rapid eruption of the NAIP and/or intrusion of hydrocarbon
reservoirs [15], dissociation of methane clathrates [12,13], or any number of other available
reservoirs. The precise emissions scenario is somewhat arbitrary, but our suggestion is by no means
implausible. In fact, Gutjahr et al. [126] gives one modelling scenario with a ca 100 year or
so initial release of carbon that is similar to what we suggest may have happened at the P-E


boundary, where a rapid initiation was followed by much slower and more protracted additions
of a significant amount of carbon (over centuries to millennia). In the Gutjahr et al. scenario, the
initial C released was quite negative, and subsequent emissions averaged out to be ca â€”12%o, but
the overall effect of the onset rate was trivial. A framework for satisfying the globally observed
requirements, and even a pulsed rapid-emissions scenario, was given by Kirtland Turner &
Ridgwell [64], but a fast initial release has otherwise received only cursory attention.
