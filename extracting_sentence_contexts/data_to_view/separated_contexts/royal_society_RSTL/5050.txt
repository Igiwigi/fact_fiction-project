When the lens was moved a very little further on the
dispersed beam with its five bands was formed complete. Indeed the whole five ap-
peared almost simultaneously. Speaking approximately, and in fact with almost
perfect accuracy, we may say that if white light be conceived to be decomposed into
two portions, the first containing rays of all refrangibilities up to that of the fixed
line b, or thereabouts, and the second containing rays of all greater refrangibilities,

portion ; and yet, were the bottle illuminated by the first portion alone, no dispersion
whatsoever would be produced, whereas were it illuminated by the second portion

dispersed rays, the dispersion would be exhibited in full perfection,
