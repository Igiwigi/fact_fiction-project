smallest quantity of alkali, In making some experiments on specimens of the
undecompounded rock taken from beneath the surface, there were evident indica-
tions of the presence of a fixed alkali, which seemed to be potash. So that it is very
probable that the decomposition depends on the operation of water and the carbonic
acid of the atmosphere on the alkali forming a constituent part of the chrystalline
matter of the feldspar, which may disintegrate from being deprived of it,

VIII. On the Nature of Ammonia and alkaline Bodies in general;
with Observations on some prospects of Discovery offered by the
preceding Facts.

Ammonia is a substance, the chemical composition of which
has always been considered of late years as most perfectly
ascertained, and the apparent conversion of it into hydrogene
and nitrogene, in the experiments of SCHEELE, PRIESTLEY,
and the more refined and accurate experiments of BERTHOLLET,
had left no doubt of its nature in the minds of the most en-
lightened chemists.

All new facts must be accompanied however by a train of
analogies, and often by suspicions with regard to the accuracy
of former conclusions. As the two fixed alkalies contain a
