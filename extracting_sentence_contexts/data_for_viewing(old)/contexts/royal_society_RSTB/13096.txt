to be reified in neuroanatomy. For example, if choice consists of
evaluation, comparison and selection, then these three concep-
tually discrete functions ought to correspond to discrete
anatomical substrates [77,78]. An alternative viewpoint is dis-
tributed; it imagines that choice reflects an emergent process
arising from multiple brain regions whose functions may not
correspond to nameable processes, and/or that may largely
overlap [18,25,79-81].

The greatest debates about modularity concern the
prefrontal cortex, which can be readily divided into a few
dozen areas based on cytoarchitecture. However, the functions
of these areas remain difficult to identify definitively. In fact,
this architectural diversity raises the question of why we
have so many prefrontal regions to begin with [82]. One possi-
bility is that each region integrates new information from new
sources and participates in transforming that information via
an untangling process [79]. In this view, each area in sequence
provides a partial transformation from one representation
format to another [83,84]. Indeed, it is this view, and not that
of a modular system, that best accords with recent results in
artificial neural networks (e.g. [85-87]). Of course, some cogni-
tive functions are localized at the coarsest levels. Our claim is
simply that, once one embraces the framework of continuous
