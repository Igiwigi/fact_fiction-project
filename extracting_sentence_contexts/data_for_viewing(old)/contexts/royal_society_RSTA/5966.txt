The time evolution of solutions of the Navier-Stokes system (1.1) with the maximizers tig,
of Problem 4.1 used as initial data was considered in [11]. It was shown that while at t= 0 the
enstrophy in these flows is generated at the maximum rate given in (4.1), this rate is very quickly
depleted such that in finite time only little enstrophy is produced, cf. figure 3a. The flow evolution
remains essentially axisymmetric with the vortex rings approaching each other before starting to
diffuse. The key conclusion from these results is that if a significant, let alone unbounded, growth
of enstrophy is to be achieved in finite time, it must be associated with initial data ug other than
the extreme vortex states Ug, saturating the upper bound in estimate (1.10) on the instantaneous
rate of growth of enstrophy, cf. (4.1).

More specifically, assuming the instantaneous rate of growth of enstrophy in the form dé/dt =
CE“ with some prefactor C > 0, any exponent a > 2 will cause €(u(t)) to become unbounded at
some finite time to = to(@) if this rate of growth is sustained over the interval [0, to). The fact that
there is no blow-up when 1 < a@ <2 follows from the observation that one factor of € in (1.10) can
