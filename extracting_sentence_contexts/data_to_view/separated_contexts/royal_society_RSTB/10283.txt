However, these earlier results were countered in the same
species by evidence that genotoxic stress did not induce com-
petence [33], as predicted by the original idea. A more recent
extension of this ‘DNA repair hypothesis’ proposes that
transformation is a general stress response [34]. This idea is
supported by the fact that some, but not all [35], naturally
transformable human pathogens such as S. pneumoniae,
Legionella pneumophila and Helicobacter pylori lack a general
SOS response and that DNA damaging agents, including
some antibiotics, induce competence in these species
[34,36,37]. Current evidence suggests, however, that the benefits
of competence induction in these species may be unlinked from
the effects of transformation per se (i.e. DNA uptake and inte-
gration) [38,39].
