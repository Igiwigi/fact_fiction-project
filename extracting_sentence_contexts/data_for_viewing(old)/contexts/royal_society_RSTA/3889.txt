Figure 7. Comparison between experimental velocity signals from GEPI spalling tests performed on PS-S grade and predictions
given by the DFH model for a mesh size of 0.25 mm. The influence of the mesh size is shown for the spalling test performed at
17000 s~".

obtained using a 0.30mm mesh size, the response is insensitive to the mesh size in terms of
pullback velocity. Indeed, numerical results given by the DFH multi-scale model converge when
increasing the mesh size. This observation is explained by the fact that, when a too small mesh
size is used, the damage process is governed by single fragmentation at the scale of the finite
elements (due to scale effect), while increasing the mesh size leads to multiple cracking at the
scale of the unit cell. For relatively coarse meshes, the response is deterministic and the strength
is given by equation (5.9). However, too large mesh size is not appropriate for the explicit scheme
and the wave propagation.
