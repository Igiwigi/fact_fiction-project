6. OTHER METHODS AND COMMENTS

(i) The deferred approach to the limit

For casual computers unused to manipulating differences and finite-difference equations,
the method used by Richardson & Gaunt (1927) for the solution of ordinary differential
equations, and applied by Hartree & Womersley (1937) and Fox (1950a) for partial
differential equations, can be applied also to the solution of integral equations.

The theory of the method depends on the fact that, under certain conditions and with the
use of certain formulae, the difference between the true solution of the integral equation
and the approximation obtained by using simple quadrature formulae at an interval h can

be written in the form E(h) = Bhe-+Oh*+.... (21)

thus if we compute approximate solutions /, for intervals h,, then the accurate solution f is
