A phlogistic chemical theory might cettainly by defended; 'on the idea that the
metals are compounds of certain unknown bases with the same, matter as that exist-
ing in hydrogene; and the metallic oxides, alkalics and acids compounds of the same
bases with water ;â€”but in this theory more nnknown principles would be aszumed
than in the generally received theory. It would be'less elegant and less distinct. In my first experiments on the distillation of the hasis "of potashr finding hydrogene
generally produced, I was led to compare the phlogistic hypothesis with the new facts,
and I found it fully adequate to the explanation, More delicate researches however
afterwards proved that in the cases when inflammable gasses appeared, water, or
some body in which hydrogene is admitted ro exist, was present. + The explanation of Van HELmonT of his fact of the production of earth in the
growth of the willow, was completely overturned by the rescarches of Wo op waRD.
