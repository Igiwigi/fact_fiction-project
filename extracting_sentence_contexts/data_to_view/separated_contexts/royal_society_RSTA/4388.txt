As can be observed, the model overestimates the experimental data in most of the CNT
diameter range investigated. This could be attributed either to a larger error in the estimation
of the effective voltage, as discussed earlier, or in the measurement of the experimental data (flow
rate and or nanotube diameter). Another possibility can be the fact that the no-slip boundary
condition has been used to solve the Navier-Stokes equation with the electro-osmotic term. There
is ample evidence in the literature, including for the same nanotubes used in this work, that
a significant amount of wall slip is present for water flowing through CNTs under a pressure
gradient. Considering slip could alter the permeability values resulting from applying the model
to the present case, at least in the pressure-driven flow case, though whether slip is possible in the
case of an electrolyte solution near a charged surface is a yet unsolved problem [1], beyond the
scope of this work.
