This is part of the general principle which we have seen to hold, namely: that
change of sex weakens the intensity of heredity.

The correlation of father and daughter appears to be abnormally below the other
three, but something of the same kind has been noted in certain stature data ; as it
is, the high correlation of father and son renders the mean paternal correlation with
offspring (*4936) sensibly equal to the mean maternal correlation (*4956).

(e.) Direct Heredity. Second Degree.—It we take the mean value of the eight
grandparental correlations, we find it equals °3164, while the mean value of the
regression of offspring on their grandparents is ‘3136. These results are absolutely
incompatible with the *15 required by Mr. Gauron’s unmodified theory, and they in
fact put the theory of blended inheritance entirely out of court. At the same time,
unlike the cases of parental, avuncular, and fraternal inheritance, they cannot be said
to be in good agreement with the value ‘25 required by the theory of exclusive

inheritance. We have to admit that our grandparental data are shorter series than
in the other cases, and that guesses as to grandparents’ eye-colour, based on memory,
miniatures, &c., were more likely to be made. Further, such guesses might easily
be biased by a knowledge of the eye-colour of more recent members of the family.
Still a reduction from *32 to ‘25 is a very large reduction, and we have to remember
that for long series in the case of the thoroughbred horses, with no such guessing at
colour as may occur with ancestors’ eyes, we found °3353 for the maternal grand-
sires, a result in excellent agreement with the ‘3343 found for the maternal grand-
fathers in the present case. Thus while the theory of exclusive inheritance without
