(4) The foregoing observation is in agreement with the known fact that the observed
strength of materials is less than one-tenth of the strength deduced indirectly from
physical data, on the assumption that the materials are isotropic. The observed

strength is, in fact, no greater than it would be, according to the theory, if the test
pieces contained cracks several thousand molecules long.

(5) It has been found possible to prepare rods and fibres of glass and fused quartz
which have a tenacity of about one million pounds per square inch (approximately
the theoretical strength) when tested in the ordinary way. The strength so observed
diminishes spontaneously, however, to a lower steady value, which it reaches a few
hours after the fibre has been prepared. This steady value depends on the diameter
of the fibre. In the case of large rods it is the same as the ordinary tenacity, whereas
in the finest fibres the strength diminishes but little from its initial high value. The
relation between diameter and strength is of practically the same form for glass fibres
as for metal wires.
