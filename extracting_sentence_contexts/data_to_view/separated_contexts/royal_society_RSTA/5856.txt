In a recent contribution of some of us [26], the effect of taxes on the wealth distribution
was studied with individual risk factors r; chosen at random at each exchange. Here we adopt a
model where risk factors are uniformly distributed in the interval [0, 1] given as initial conditions
that remain fixed along time. The fact that individual risk factors are constant is very important,
as the goal of the present paper is to compare with the role of agent’s decisions concerning the
risk factors on the individual and globally distributed wealth. The simulations of this section and §3 were performed with N = 10° agents and averaged over
10° samples. The total wealth is normalized to 1.
