On the widely accepted theory, it would therefore be necessary to assume some close
relationship between these three families, and also between them and Megaladapis.
: I feel sure that not one of the adherents of trituberculism will venture to uphold such
a view, although it would be consistent with the theory. But it will be asserted that
they must rather be regarded merely as lowly organized representatives of their
respective orders. This assertion is disposed of by the fact that each family comprises some form
showing a tendenty to further reduction of the cusps of the molars, viz., the Carnivore
Eupleres, the Insectivore Hemicentetes, and the Lemuroids Chirogale Milii and
Chiromys. These same genera, as well as Megaladapis, exhibit, moreover, evidence of retro-
gressive evolution in other characters. Hence it is reasonable to conclude that the
tritubercular condition of the molars is the result of similar evolution, and by no
means a primitive condition,

We may even go further, and saitiat the belief that the tritubercular type of molar
has had a common origin.
