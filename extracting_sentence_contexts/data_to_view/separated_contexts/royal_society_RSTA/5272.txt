and his group continued to explore medical and biological applications of XPCI implemented
with the Bonse-Hart interferometer, as reported, for example, in their 1996 Nature Medicine
paper [4]. Almost simultaneously, researchers started to explore a different approach to the use of crystals
in XPCI—namely the use of a perfect crystal as an ‘angular analyser’. It was in fact observed
that the faint distortions in the wavefront caused by phase changes translate directly into slight
changes in the X-ray direction (X-ray refraction), which could therefore be picked up by a
system with sufficient angular sensitivity like a perfect crystal. The fact that the refraction angle
is proportional to the gradient of the phase shift gave rise to the name ‘differential’ XPCI, which
is common to other methods listed below, such as edge-illumination and Talbot interferometry. The most famous paper pioneering this approach is the 1995 Nature letter by Davis et al. [5].
