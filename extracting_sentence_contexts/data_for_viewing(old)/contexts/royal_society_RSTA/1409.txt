A numerical study on thermal jet drilling exploiting the thermal spallation phenomenon exhibited
by granite was carried out. The governing discretized system of equations was solved with
explicit time stepping. While this substantially facilitated the solution of the problem with
temperature-dependent material properties and damage-dependent thermal conductivity, it also
imposed a severe restriction on the critical time step of the mechanical part of the system of
equations. Fortunately, the mechanical part of the problem admitted extreme mass scaling of
using 10000-fold density (even 100 000-fold with a minor error), which increased the critical time
step to 100-fold allowing practically convenient solution times. It is the relatively low loading rate
nature of the thermal loading that renders the mechanical part amenable to mass scaling.

The 3D simulations of the thermal jet drilling corroborated the already experimentally
established fact that this method is a viable one with granite rock. Rock heterogeneity has a
significant effect in facilitating the underlying thermal spallation phenomenon. More precisely, a
test simulation using a heat flux, modelling a thermal jet with 10 mm of radius, with an intensity
of 3 MWm~ and a duration of 0.1s, followed by 0.1s natural cooling phase, showed that
the significant rate of penetration, approximately 300mm min~!, can be theoretically achieved.
This is a novel result possible to be achieved only through genuine 3D simulations. Finally, a
test simulation exploiting heating-forced cooling cycle demonstrated that this method is more
economical in heated rock mass since sufficient damage levels can be achieved when the heated
zone is rapidly cooled down to a temperature lower than that of the surrounding rock mass. It
can be concluded that the present model can serve as a valuable numerical tool for the research
and development of thermal jet drilling.
