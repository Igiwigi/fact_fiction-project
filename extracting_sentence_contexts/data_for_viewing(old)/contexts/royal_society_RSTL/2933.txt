3. Nurse Bees. —Voluntary Power of generating Heat.

The above experiments on the nest of Bombus terrestris thus confirmed the results
of my observations made a short time before on individual insects with regard to
the rapid transmission of heat from the body of the animal when in. a state of
excitement, and also in a less degree when in a state of rest; but during the time I
was engaged upon them they also afforded me a new and totally unexpected phe-
nomenon, and one which is not a little interesting and important as regards its con-
nection with the origin of animal heat ;—it was the capability which these insects
possess during the act of incubation on the cells which contain nymphs, of increasing
their own temperature many degrees above that of the surrounding medium, of in
fact a voluntary power of generating heat through means of respiration. Hunzr has
stated that there are certain individuals in the nests of the Humble Bees, and among
the bees in a hive, which at a particular season of the year are employed to impart
warmth from their bodies to the young bees in the combs by brooding oyer them,
and these he called Nurse Bees. It gives me great pleasure in being able to bear
testimony to the correctness of his statement, particularly with regard to those in the
nest of the Humble Bee, which I had ample opportunity of observing. These indi-
viduals are chiefly the young female bees, and at the period of the hatching of nymphs
they seem to be occupied almost solely in increasing the heat of the nest and com-
municating warmth to the nymphs in the cells by crowding upon them and clinging
to them very closely, during which time they respire very rapidly, and evidently are
much excited. These bees begin to crowd upon the cells of the nymphs about ten
or twelve hours before the nymph makes its appearance as a perfect bee. The incu-
