multiplied by 2.

Remarks on Columns.

Column I.—The sum of the differences (—0°5) and the distribution of the signs
show that the experimental values are very evenly distributed about the locus of the
curve.

Column II.—The experimental values of N, Na, and K do not appear to be
sufficiently established to lend much weight to the results.

The experimental value of the specific heat of tin at 0° C., as compared with that
of other metals examined by us, is high. It is a significant fact that tin, at
temperatures below 0° C., tends to revert into the grey powder form.

[Since the above was written, we have made determinations of the specific heat of
sodium at 0° C. Two different samples were used, and the results were in close
agreement, giving the value 0°2863 for the specific heat.

The few experiments at higher temperatures (50° C.) indicate that the increase in
specific heat with temperature is considerably greater in the case of sodium than in
the other metals examined by us, and is of the order of 0°11 per cent. per 1° C.

In this connection it should be remembered that sodium has the lowest melting-
point of all the metals considered in the above table. |
