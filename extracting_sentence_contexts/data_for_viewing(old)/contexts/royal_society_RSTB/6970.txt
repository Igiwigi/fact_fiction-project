I think that if the differences of levels and dates of banks are ascertained, their collation will
produce some interesting conclusions regarding changes in sea-level from, say, the tenth to the
sixteenth century, and then at intervals up to the present time. The present salt marshes appear
to be growing seaward at about one-third of a mile per ten years. I suggest that all this indicates
that sea-level has been rising for part, if not all, of the last thousand years, and more so recently.

The author would like to thank Major Fowler for having so kindly provided this
note, and at the same time to express his indebtedness to Dr S. E. Hollingworth who
has beneficially criticized the manuscript of this paper.

CoNcLUSIONS

Perhaps the most striking feature of the graph is the fact that it should be possible to
construct at all a single curve which violates none of the evidence except two indices at
Ingoldmells: one is the Roman level already referred to, and the other is the Triglochin
clay (7c) which is too high by 10 or 15 ft. Possibly local tidal conditions suffice to
explain this. The consistency of the data is a strong support for the general validity of
the curve, and it will be of very great interest to see how far future discoveries in the
Fenland are capable of fitting it.

The chief value of the curve is that it clearly demonstrates the great extent of marine
transgression since the early post-Glacial, and also gives some measure of the rate at
which it progressed. It may be said that the early indices give only minimum values,
but these are in themselves striking enough, and it must be remembered that peat of
Atlantic age (zone VII) is never encountered save in the shallower parts of the North
