of the 11. In the two exceptional years, 1896 and 1899, the deficiency in the value
of RY in the first group is only 3,-and so possesses little significance. On the average
of the eleven years, the excess of the percentage values of R’ in the first group
amounts to 6°7. If we regard this as a percentage on 60°7y, the mean value of R
in H for the eleven years, we get 4’0,y as corresponding to a’ difference of 16°8 in 8.
On a formula of the type R’ = lg S, this would give

100 b/a = 0°47.

In the case of R the higher percentage, value is associated with the higher value
of S in 7 years. In one of the 4 exceptional years, 1899, the deficiency in R is
substantial, but this possesses less significance than would otherwise be the case from
the fact that the difference between the values of S for the two groups in that year is
little over half the average. The excess in the percentage value of R in the group of
higher values of S, on the average of the 11 years, is 4]. If we regard this as a
percentage on 80°7y, the mean value of R in H from the 132 months, we get 1'26y
as corresponding to a difference of 16°8 in S. On a formula of the type R = a+)8,

this would give
100 b/a = 0°27.
