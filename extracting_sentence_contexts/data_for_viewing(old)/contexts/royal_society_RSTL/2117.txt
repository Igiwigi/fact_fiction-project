which cannot be removed entire. This tube is in fact left
behind in the progress of the animal, and forms a complete
lining for the hole, which it supports, and keeps pervious
through its whole length. The worm is thus enabled to as-
cend readily to the surface, and the water is admitted freely
to the branchiz.

A few of the anterior rings of the Arenicola progressively
diminish in size, and each admits of being completely folded
within the ring immediately behind it. Hence, when they
are fully retracted, the anterior extremity of the animal is
truncated abruptly ; while it is extended to a regular cone
when they are projected to a point just short of developing
