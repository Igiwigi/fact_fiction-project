WHEN on a former occasion I communicated the results of a series of
experiments on the Friction and Resistance of the Surfaces of Solids (Philo-
sophical Transactions for 1828), I stated that they formed part only of a series
of experiments on the nature of friction generally. My object at first was to
trace the relation subsisting between the retardation produced by the surfaces
of solids in motion when in contact with each other and with fluids ; but
finding that the subject connected with either of these branches was sufficiently
extensiye, I deemed it necessary to postpone the second part of the inquiry to
a future occasion. Those experiments, however, established some important
facts. They showed that (within the limits of abrasion) friction was the same
for all solids, and that it was neither affected by surface nor velocity, Subse-
quent experiments upon rolling bodies of great weight and magnitude, when
the resistance was reduced 757th part of the mass, and the surfaces in the
ratio of 13 to 1, haye corroborated the affinity of resistance between rolling
and sliding bodies. Thus in connecting and continuing the isolated experi-
ments of CouLoms and ViNcs, and assigning values to the abrasive resistances
of most of the most useful solids, a considerable advance has been made in the
8cience.
