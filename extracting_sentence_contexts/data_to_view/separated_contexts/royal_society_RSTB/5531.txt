of calcium oxalate in the relatively concentrated solution of salts from which it was
precipitated.

(5) Estumation of Glycollic Acid.â€”Since no specific method is available for the
estimation of glycollic acid, advantage was taken of the fact that glycollic acid is the
only product of the action of iodine on kojie acid which contains a hydroxyl group
which can be acetylated by means of acetic anhydride and sodium acetate, to estimate
the acid by this means. Preliminary experiments with pure glycollic acid had shown
that this reaction provides a reasonably satisfactory quantitative method. The experimental details (amounts of kojic acid, reagents, etc.) are the same as those
used in the preparation of the reaction mixture for the estimation of oxalic acid.
