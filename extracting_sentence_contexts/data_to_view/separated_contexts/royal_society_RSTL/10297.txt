An examination of the figures in the table shows that, as compared with double the
quantity of nitrogen as ammonia-salts, the increase obtained by the smaller quantity
of nitrate of so0da was chiefly in the Graminez, but considerable also in the Legu-
minose and in the miscellaneous herbage. As compared with the results obtained

with the double quantity of nitrate, the small total deficiency was chiefly in the

Syrasses, whilst there was, on the average, an increase in the amount of both the

Jeguminous and the miscellaneous species. E The columns of percentage of the individual species show at, a glance much Jess

=xcess of any single plantâ€”in fact, a much more generally mixed herbage than with

She double amount of nitrogen, whether as ammonia-salts or as nitrate of soda., Now,

WMeither Fesuca oving nor Agrostis vilgaris takes the first place over the average

If the four separation-years ; Alopecurus pratensis is here, on the average, the most

-Prominent, plant, though, it is true, declining from the firs} to the fourth separation-
ear. Agrostis vulgaris and PFestuca ovina come next in average proportion, each

Farying considerably in prominence, but the two somewhat in opposite directions, from
ear to year. An examination of the climatal characters of the seasons of separation,

"2nd of the intervening ones, will show that the fluctuations in the relative prevalence

Sf these two plants were s8uch as might be expected, the freer-growing, creeping, and

Moisture-loving Agrostis being the more prominent in the years of comparatively

Yuxuriant growth, and Festuca ovina in those of generally more restricted gramineous

Juxuriance.
