as the rate of secretion increases, but that the increment in the percentage
of salts becomes less with each successive equal increment in the rate of
secretion.

We may now pass to consider the conditions under which the statement just made
no longer holds.

Errecr oF STiIMULATING THE SYMPATHETIC NERVE.

As far as we know, no attention has been called to the fact that the percentage of
salts in sympathetic saliva is greater than that which corresponds to its rate of

secretion, if chorda saliva be taken as a basis of comparison,
The following experiments bring out clearly the lack of correspondence between
the rate of flow and the percentage of salts, when sympathetic and chorda saliva are

compared :—
