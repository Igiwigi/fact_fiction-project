role of coevolution in opening multiple paths to future innovation.
Palaeontologists Gould & Vrba [7] introduced the concept of exaptations to
refer to organismal traits either that are non-adaptive when they originate, or
that were selected for a different function than the one currently performed.
For example, the evolution of genome complexity from prokaryotes to
multicellular eukaryotes might have non-adaptive origins [8]. This non-
adaptationist theory is supported by the increase in genome entropy, which
is inevitably triggered by the reduction of population size—which, in turn,
