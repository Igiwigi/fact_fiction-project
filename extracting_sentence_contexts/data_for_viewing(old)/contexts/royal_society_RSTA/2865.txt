Importantly, for the reasons above, we do not argue that the impact is responsible for the
bulk of the carbon needed to generate the approximately 170 kyr event (onset through recovery)
observed globally [23]. This is a truly colossal amount of carbon [126] and very unlikely to be
sourced from a target rock or impactor alone. We merely suggest that the impact was most
likely responsible for the initial onset of the excursion, which was followed shortly by multiple
accompanying (and much more sluggish) additions of carbon from various Earth reservoirs.
These sources could be the rapid eruption of the NAIP and/or intrusion of hydrocarbon
reservoirs [15], dissociation of methane clathrates [12,13], or any number of other available
reservoirs.

The precise emissions scenario is somewhat arbitrary, but our suggestion is by no means
implausible. In fact, Gutjahr et al. [126] gives one modelling scenario with a ca 100 year or
so initial release of carbon that is similar to what we suggest may have happened at the P-E


boundary, where a rapid initiation was followed by much slower and more protracted additions
of a significant amount of carbon (over centuries to millennia). In the Gutjahr et al. scenario, the
initial C released was quite negative, and subsequent emissions averaged out to be ca â€”12%o, but
the overall effect of the onset rate was trivial. A framework for satisfying the globally observed
requirements, and even a pulsed rapid-emissions scenario, was given by Kirtland Turner &
Ridgwell [64], but a fast initial release has otherwise received only cursory attention.

We propose an easily testable scenario (and make other predictions that should be observable)
if a more nuanced release schedule is applied to the onset and body of the P-E CIE. Because
