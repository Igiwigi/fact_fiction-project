will add the remark which he makes on this experiment :—* On sait que Vacide
chlorhydrique n'attaque le cuivre qu'avec une extreme difficult6, et la presence de
Ihydrogene, loin de favoriser la reaction, devrait, Capres les lois de Taffinit6, y
ajouter un nouvel obstacle. La d6composition de Vhydrure de cuivre par Vacide
chlorhydrique parait done seffectuer en vertu d'une action de contact#,”

This fact, the conception of which offers these theoretical difficulties, becomes per-
fectly intelligible, and indeed might have been predicted from the principles I have laid
down. The decompoxsition is perfectly similar to that of the suboxide of copper under
analogous circumstances, arises from the same cause, and may be expressed thus—

+ = +=
Cu, H HCl=Cu, Cl+H,. Ry

'This experiment enables us to see clearly the canse of a class of decompositions very
analogous to it, and which have presented similar theoretical difficulties.
