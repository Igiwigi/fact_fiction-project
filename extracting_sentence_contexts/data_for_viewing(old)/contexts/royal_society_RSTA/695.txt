In the simplified examples shown in figure 1, one can intuitively understand how a random :3
sample of measurements of height above sea level across a golf course is unlikely to reveal the all- :
important locations of the holes, and how curve-fitting methods will struggle to map the recursive
nature of a fractal surface.

Deep theory requires deep thinking, for both discovery and validation. Writing with Leopold
Infeld, Albert Einstein explained how thinking had evolved in their book The Evolution of Physics:
The Growth of Ideas From Early Concepts to Relativity and Quanta:

In nearly every detective novel since the admirable stories of Conan Doyle there comes a
time when the investigator has collected all the facts he needs for at least some phase of his
problem. These facts often seem quite strange, incoherent, and wholly unrelated. The great
detective, however, realizes that no further investigation is needed at the moment, and that
only pure thinking will lead to a correlation of the facts collected. So he plays his violin, or
lounges in his armchair enjoying a pipe, when suddenly, by Jove, he has it! Not only does
he have an explanation for the clues at hand but he knows that certain other events must
have happened. Since he now knows exactly where to look for it, he may go out, if he likes,
to collect further confirmation for his theory. [18]

Given Baconâ€™s analogy, one is reminded of the story of the blind men and the elephant: local
data are difficult to interpret without a mental model of a pachyderm. In a similar way, various
big data initiatives are blindly groping about that great beast that we know as biology. We need
theory to help envisage it in all its glory.
