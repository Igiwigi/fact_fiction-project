Ibrough the capillaries being the immediate result. An hour and a half later, how-
Sver, the flow was observed to be less rapid, no doubt in consequence of slight contrac-
lon of the arteries, one of which, in the left foot, measured 3* by micrometer, and after
Aixteen hours more they were both moderate and variable in calibre in both feet ; that
EN the left limb before noted now changing between 12® and 2®, and a principal artery
In the right foot between 1% and 13% The circulation meanwhile continued active, and
ained 80 more than twelve envi longer ; from which circumstance, as well as from
Abe normal appearance of the contractions, it was evident that the arteries were still
under the control of the cord ; and I may add, that in another animal in which the same
operation was performed upon the thigh after removal of the brain and cord, the arteries
remained of full size and without variation for thirty-four hours, after which circulation
ceased.
From these facts it appears that there exists a very remarkable provision for ensuring
the proper regulation of the arterial calibre in a part in spite of almost complete divi-
