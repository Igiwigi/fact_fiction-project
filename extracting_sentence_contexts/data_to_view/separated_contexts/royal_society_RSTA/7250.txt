We can, however, make our analysis
yield a simple result if we make a restriction on the problem considered. This
consists in assuming that the quantity c? cos # sin? ¢ cos é remains small. Equation

where b is another arbitrary constant; in fact 6 = sin gp. The velocity at 0 = 0 is given by n = be. GENERAL MOTION OF THE AEROPLANE 349
