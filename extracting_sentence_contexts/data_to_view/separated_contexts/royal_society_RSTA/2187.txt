The cathode glow in Helium presents a very striking appearance
when viewed through coloured screens which transmit only a narrow region of the
spectrum. Through a violet screen the dark space around the electrode is clearly
defined and surrounded by a uniform glow. Viewed through a screen which transmits
red rays only, the appearance is entirely changed, the “ dark space” being in fact the
region in which the red rays are predominant. The band spectrum of Helium is
relatively strong in the cathode glow, though not intrinsically so strong as with the
“bulb discharge.” *
