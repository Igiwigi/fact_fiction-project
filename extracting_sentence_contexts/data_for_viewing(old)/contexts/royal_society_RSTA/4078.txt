The corresponding S(T) diagram is shown in figure 2b. Such a behaviour is, for instance, : &
observed in certain Fe2P-type materials or in Laâ€”Fe-Si [32]. Owing to the existence of the thermal 22
hysteresis, the entropy curves under heating and cooling also do not coincide. This has far- : S
reaching consequences for the MCE under magnetic-field cycling. If there is no thermal hysteresis : s
related to the transition, then the ATaq and ASm as shown in figure 1a-f would be the same in : B
the cyclic operation. But, due to the hysteresis, a reversible effect can only be obtained in the : s
highlighted area. .

The horizontal arrow in figure 2b illustrates how the material in the purely high-temperature
phase (after cooling from temperatures well above the transition) would heat when the magnetic
field is applied for the first time. About half of the material would transform in this example.
However, when the magnetic field is removed again, the initial state would not be reached.
In fact, the adiabatic temperature change under cycling would be smaller, as indicated by the
horizontal double-sided arrow. This description of the thermal hysteresis can be transferred
straightforwardly to the first-order transition of inverse magnetocaloric materials, which is shown
in figure 2c,d.

3. Magnetic refrigeration and magnetocaloric materials

The development of a magnetocaloric cooling system based on the magnetocaloric principle at
ambient temperature has not yet been realized as an economic and industrial product. Since
the first demonstrator developed by Brown in 1976 [33], only a few research groups around
the world have worked on demonstrators operating close to ambient temperature [26,34-39].
There are a number of problems to be solved, most importantly to find suitable materials with
large MCEs in small fields using non-critical materials and efficient heat exchangers operating
