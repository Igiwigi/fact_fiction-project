* Well-known phenomena of bubbles, and of watery films wetting solids, make it
quite certain that the molecular attraction does not become sensible until the distance
is much less than 250 micro-millimetres. From the consideration of 8uch phenomena,
Qvixcke (* Poggendorff, Annalen,” 1869) came to the conclusion that the molecular
attraction does become sensible at distances of about 50 micro-millimetres. His
conclusion is strikingly confirmed by the very important discovery of ReixoLD and
Ricker that the black film, always formed before an undisturbed s0ap bubble breaks,
has a uniform or nearly uniform thickness of about 11- or 12 micro-millimetres. The
abrupt commencement and the permanent stability of the black film demonstrate a
proposition of fundamental importance in the molecular theory. The tension of the
film, which is sensibly constant when the thickness exceeds 50 micro-millimetres,
diminishes to a minimum, and begins to increase again when the thickness is
diminished to 10 micro-millimetres, Tt seems not possible to explain this fact by
any imaginable Jaw of force between the different portions of the film supposed
homogeneous, and we are forced to the conclusion that it depends upon molecular
heterogeneousness.”

It is, perhaps, unnecessary to say that, we were unaware of Sir W. TroMs0N's views
till within the last few days, or that we are glad to find that our opinion has the
support of 80 high an authority.
