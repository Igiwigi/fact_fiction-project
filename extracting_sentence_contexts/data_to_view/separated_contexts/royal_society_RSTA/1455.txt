patterns which then demand further explanation, where scientific theories are required to make
sense of what is discovered. We have written elsewhere [7] of the fact that rapid ‘successes’ of BD
approaches take far longer to turn into sources of scientific insight. In passing, however, we cannot refrain from commenting on the resurgence of use of the term
‘artificial intelligence’ in this context, more than forty years after Marvin Minsky’s unfortunate
claim that computers were just a few years away from emulating human intelligence. That
wild claim led to a decades-long ‘AI winter’ from which one observes not only a thaw but the
extravagant hype accompanying any claimed successes of the BD approach.
