These differ from the first or primordial “ cone ”
in having a double origin, 7.e., in arising from two separate rudiments, one of which is,
as a rule, slightly in advance of the other (fig. 14, b-e). These rudiments develop into
lamellee. Since Devanesen (1922) started with a comparatively late stage, he was naturally
unaware of the fact that, in H. miliaris, the first “ cone’ differs from all succeeding
ones in having a simple origin. As all subsequent ones are formed from a pair of lamellie,
he writes, ‘‘ one may therefore reasonably infer that each of these five (primordial) cones
also arises in the same way from a pair of lamelle,” and these he termed the “ pair of
primordial lamelle.’’ The larger lamella of the second “ cone ” almost equals the first
“cone” in length in advanced Kchinoplutei (see fig. 14, e, also Plate 11, fig. 1 given by
DeEvANESEN). This, together with the fact that the two lamelle of “ cone” 2 are still

’

far from fusing might have suggested that the first “‘ cone ”’ is either simple from the
beginning, or, if double, the lamellae must fuse very early.
