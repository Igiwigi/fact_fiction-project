we found that these properties of the intermittent discharge rendered possible
variety of other phenomena, all of which were explicable by this theory of the dis
charge, 80 also in the case of tubes of high exhaustion all the other phenomena »
follow from these properties of the discharge are also manifested, and serve in their bu
to demonstrate the identity between discharges in high-vacuum and in Jow-vaeut
tubes. Thus very good unipolar and double unipolar effects can be obtained, w
festing, with certain modifications, the same peculiar phenomena which we
accustomed to 8ee in connexion with them in low-vacuum tubes. So easily are
effects attainable that (as will be seen later on) they afford to us the readiesb way!

And if we recollect how intimately the existence of unipolar and double unipolar d
charges in ordinary vacuum tubes is connected with the fact that the discharge ©
each terminal is independent of the action elsewhere than in its own neighbourho
we shall see that the existence of similar phenomena in high-yacuum tubes is strol
evidence of the substantial identity of the modus operand! of the discharge in the by

portion of the evidence in favour of the proposition of which we are treating.
here are phenomena of the relief and special effects in tubes of high exhaust, which
then we come to consider them will afford, if possible, still more conclusive evidence of

he truth of the hypothesis. But it is for many reasons desirable that we should
#1 anticipate the examination of the relief and special phenomena, of high exhaust
"2 , because we propose to deal with them separately as they merit a much more
- ainute examination than we could conveniently give them in this section.
