in addition to MAxwe t’s distribution of stress, there are other stresses in a mag-
netised body due to the fact that the magnetisation depends upon the strain in
the body. Hitherto no direct experiments have been made with the object of ascertaining
whether these stresses, in addition to those of MAxweELL, are sufficient to account
for the observed deformation of bodies placed in a magnetic field. The facts that
“Villari reversals” of opposite kinds exist in iron and cobalt, and also opposite
reversals of magnetic deformation, and that in nickel (at any rate at moderate field-
