completely separated from the thymus. It is less elongated than in (@) and is no
longer connected with the ultimobranchial body. Fig. 39 shows a horizontal section
through thymus IV (#m. IV) and epithelial body IV (ep.b. IV) at a level where the two
are in process of separation. In this embryo (}) it is worthy of note that the remnant
of the lumen of pouch 4 extends from the epithelial body into the dorsal part of the
thymus, where it is enclosed by epithelially arranged cells. In (a) the separated
epithelial body is luminated, whilst in the dorsal part of the thymus there is present a
conspicuous rounded cavity likewise enclosed by epithelially arranged cells, and

evidently formed from the part of the cleft-lumen formerly continued into it. Cavities
of this sort, though not always directly traceable to remnants of the pouch-lumen, are
of frequent occurrence in later stages in both thymus III and IV. They are not
present in thymus III of this stage and, in fact, are always more numerous in
thymus IV than in thymus II. We shall refer to them henceforth as thymic
cavities.

The ultimobranchial body (fig. 38, u.b.) has also lost connection with the

pharyngeal duct. It is situated just medially to the carotid artery, and has now
undergone a noteworthy change in its relations, having moved forwards and
upwards in such a way that its original ventral end is now directed cranially, and
lies just postero-dorsally to the lateral lobe of the thyroid on each side. In this
