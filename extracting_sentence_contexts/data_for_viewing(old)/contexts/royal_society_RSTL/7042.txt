transport of such angular fragments, and the common irregularity of their bedding, arose
from drifting shore-ice. The usually small size of the fragments and the general absence
of subangular gravel is also compatible only with the thin ice that might be formed at
night during the spring floods, and away from the shingle-strewed river-channel.

The valley-gravels by themselves give no direct evidence of the extent of the floods.
They merely show, in the quantity of d6bris, the coarse shingle, and the worn blocks, the
results of torrential action. If, however, we admit the flood-water origin of the Loess, it
necessarily follows that, as we find this deposit on ground 50 (if not 100) feet above
the highest beds of the valley-gravels (which fix approximately the position of the main
channels of the old rivers), it gives a measure of the floods of that period, and shows them
to have exceeded even those of arctic rivers at the present day, for the waters of these
rivers rarely rise more than 40 to 50 feet above their low summer level. This fact fur-
nishes, therefore, strong corroborative evidence of the scouring and erosive energy of
these 01d rivers, and tends to strengthen the opinion, before expressed, of their power to
excavate, when taken in conjunction with the other agencies before described, the large
valleys through which the rivers now flow in such dwarfed volumes. I would observe
that in each valley the height to which the Loess rises above the high-level valley-
gravels is proportionate to the length of the valley and the area drained, showing

therefore its dependence upon them, and that it is not referable to any uniform level or
to any general cause.

Another character common to the Loess, and pointing, I conceive, to the same flood-
water origin, is the presence of numerous 8mall worm-like cavities penetrating the mass.
