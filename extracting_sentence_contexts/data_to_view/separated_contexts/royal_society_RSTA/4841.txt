They concluded that these brightenings occurred at least
two to three times an hour along the line of sight through any pixel. Further evidence for such hot
plasmas has been found in a recent rocket flight [53]. Spectrally resolved observations at soft X-ray wavelengths were in fact obtained with the Flat
Crystal Spectrometer and the Bent Crystal Spectrometer on the Solar Maximum Mission (SMM)
in the 1980s. A re-analysis of these observations of quiescent ARs suggests that the slope of the
differential emission measure (DEM) at temperatures above 10°” K can be extremely steep [54]. Parametrizing the DEM as EM(T) ~ T?, they obtained values for b between 14 and 24. (This
result may be affected by the limited number of emission lines formed near the peak in the
DEM and the relatively small sample size (only six of the 40 available SMM observations were
considered to be quiescent).) Warren et al. [40] analysed 15 Hinode and SDO AR observations and
obtained somewhat smaller values for the slope above the maximum (b ~ 6-10), but this study
only included a single emission line formed near T~ 107° K.
