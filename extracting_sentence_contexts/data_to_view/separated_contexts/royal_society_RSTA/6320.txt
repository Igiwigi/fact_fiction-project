similar behaviour; the main difference from w(q) arises from the fact that the single-particle limit
is given by a constant instead of a parabolic divergence. For rs = 4, we find a very similar picture to that of rs =2 for both w(q) and the three datasets
for AF,(q). Upon further decreasing the density to r; = 10, the dispersion starts to exhibit the
incipient roton minimum around intermediate wavenumbers.
