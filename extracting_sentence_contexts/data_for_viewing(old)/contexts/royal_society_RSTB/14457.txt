regret, relief, counterfactual emotions, Regret is an emotion that arises when we compare what is happening in the pre-
counterfactual thinking, mental time travel sent to what would be happening had an alternative course of events taken place

in the past [1,2]. For example, when caught in a downpour you might feel regret
if you realize that you did not pack an umbrella in the morning. Regret thus
presupposes a capacity for counterfactual thinking: reflecting on a past event
and understanding that there were once other ways that event might have

behave more adaptively when confronted with similar situations with multiple
possible outcomes in the future [2,4,6,7]. In fact, evidence suggests that adults
explicitly identify regret as the most beneficial negative emotion, in terms of
both learning from past mistakes and making better future choices [8].

Children’s capacity for counterfactual thinking appears to gradually mature
over development. Initial signs of imagining alternatives to current reality
emerge around 18 months, when toddlers begin to engage in pretend play
(for reviews, see [9-12]). To experience regret, however, one needs more than
an ability to entertain multiple versions of the present; one must be able to men-
tally ‘undo’ a past event and consider a counterfactual past possibility [13,14].
That is, children must recognize that, at one point in the now-fixed past, there
were multiple possible ways the future could have unfolded [3-5].
