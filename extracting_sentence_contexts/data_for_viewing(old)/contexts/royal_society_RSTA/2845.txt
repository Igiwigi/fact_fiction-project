Wojtkowski [28], by means of the so-called mirror formula. This approach was later exploited
by Bialy [29] for billiards on the sphere and the hyperbolic plane, as well as for magnetic billiards.

Observe that Bialy and Wojtkowski’s result is not in contrast with what we have discussed
in the case of elliptic billiards. In fact, in that case the family of convex caustics represented by
confocal ellipses do not foliate the whole domain (the segment between the two foci is left out),
and neither set of homotopically non-trivial invariant curves has full @-measure in the phase
space: the homotopically trivial invariant curves corresponding to orbits tangent to confocal
hyperbolae, foliate a positive @-measure set (in the phase portrait (figure 4) this set corresponds to
the area below the separatrix, i.e. the stable/unstable manifold of the hyperbolic 2-periodic orbit
corresponding to the major semi-axis of the ellipse).

What about other notions of integrability? In the study of integrable systems, in fact, in most :23
of the cases integrals of motion are non-degenerate not everywhere, but either on an open-dense : =
subset of the phase space (we shall refer to this as global integrability) or just a proper (non-trivial) :§
open subset (we shall refer to this as local integrability). : =

Remark 4.3. An interesting result* by Innami [30] shows that the existence of caustics with : a
rotation numbers accumulating to 3 implies that the billiard must be an ellipse. This regime of [4
integrability is somehow opposite to the one we are interested in, which is concerned with caustics : >
