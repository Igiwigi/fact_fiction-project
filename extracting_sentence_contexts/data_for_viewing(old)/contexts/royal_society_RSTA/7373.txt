Further evidence of a low reflexion coefficient was obtained from the reflexion shots in
which the records were characterized by the initial amplitude of the bottom reflexion
being smaller than the amplitude of the sound scattered back from below the bottom.

With other experimental results obtained in the deep sea (Ewing 19502) multiple
reflexions up to at least the third order have been identified, while in the same experiments

no evidence for multiple refractions was obtained. These two facts indicate that in the
western Atlantic where these experiments were carried out the consolidation with depth
is less gradual than in our area.

5:2. The phases arriving before the direct sound

The phases which arrive before the direct sound represent paths passing along the
interface beolw the sediments except for one point which is of great importance in con-
firming the sedimentary structure obtained from the multiple refractions discussed above.
This point, which was obtained from the closest shot of station 2, represents an arrival
passing along the layer of constant velocity which it was concluded must exist below the
region where there was a linear increase of velocity with depth. It was fortuitous that
a shot was fired exactly at the distance required to obtain this point, since if it had been
