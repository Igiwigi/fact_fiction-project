Thus
arranged, it is difficult to see how they could have functioned as K1AEr suggested,
forming a “ sort of biting or crushing mouth,” for their grasping and holding powers
must have been extremely feeble and, moreover, considerably hampered by the post-
oral covers, although these seem to have been absent in his Downtonian species. Srensié (1932, p. 184) has pointed out that these plates could not have worked
directly against each other with their tuberculated surfaces, nor could the plates have
moved up and down like a lower jaw, and compares them and the “ maxillary plate ”
with the epidermal teeth on the rasping-organ and “ ethmoidal plate” of Moxine. This seems to me to be a wholly fictitious comparison ; there is no evidence whatever
of a powerful structure corresponding to the Hag-fish’s tongue, as Goopricu (1929,
p- 46) has already pointed out, and the form of the plates seems to militate against
their use in this manner. Only the posterior dorsal half of each plate was attached,

the remainder being covered with epidermis, like the rest of the “ ornamented ?
exoskeleton, the “ ornamentation ” of which Srensi6 has plausibly correlated with
the sensory or mucous system. The denticles on the anterior ends of the plates and
on the underside of the rostrum show no signs of wear, as they must have done if they
