As already discussed above, not all the games have a pure Nash equilibrium. So that the
previous result might be of limited interest. This is why we now consider the mixed strategy
extension that always has Nash equilibria as recalled in §2.


Theorem 4.2 (Nash equilibria in mixed strategies converge to Cournot-Nash equilibria). If
assumption (4.1) holds for w(t) = Kt, then the conclusions of theorem 4.1 applies to the extension in mixed
strategies with the extended cost

NG, 0-) = es IN Gi,x,-i)m(dx) @ a; (dx).

This theorem is a direct consequence of the fact that for uniformly Lipschitz J, the extension
in mixed strategies still satisfies (4.1).

Lemma 4.3. Under the assumptions of theorem 4.2, the extended cost J satisfies

TN (i, mi, 01) — FSG), nis n-i)| < Kdo (6), 6) + KWi (01, ni)
