In the first series the ripe seeds have far less individuality than the aborted seeds,
in fact, the smallest homotyposis I have yet observed ; in the second series the ripe
seeds have a value rising to ‘2, which is higher than that of the aborted seeds. Ash


HOMOTYPOSIS IN THE VEGETABLE KINGDOM. 369

trees from Monmouthshire, Buckinghamshire, and Dorsetshire, gave results in good
agreement ; but sweet peas from two different nursery gardens in the same district
give strikingly divergent homotypic correlations ! According to Darwin (‘The Effects of Cross and Self-Fertilisation,’ 3rd edition,
p- 153) the sweet pea “in this country seems invariably to fertilise itself.” He bases
this statement on (a) the difficulty of access to bees and other insects, ()) the fact that
the varieties are habitually grown by seed growers close together, and yet the colours
do not blend, (¢) the experience that when the varieties are artificially crossed the
colours do change. Professor DELPHINO, of Florence, in a letter to DARwry, writes
that it is the fixed opinion of the Italian gardeners that the varieties do cross ; but
in Italy other insects may of course be available. Now it is most remarkable that in
Series I., whether the sweet pea be crossed or self-fertilised, the number of ripe seeds
should be hardly individual at all.
