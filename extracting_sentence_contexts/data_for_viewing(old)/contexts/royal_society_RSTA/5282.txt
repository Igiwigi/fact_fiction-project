consistent with the time scale of atomic motion at the considered temperature, and agrees with
our experimental results (figure 3).

5. Conclusion

Self-structuring of the atomic density in a cloud of a cold atomic gas that is optically pumped
can be interpreted as a transition to a synchronized state of Kuramoto oscillators. Although this
connection was made in cases where strong damping is present [7,21], we have shown that the


analogy can be extended to cases where no damping is present such as those of the experimental | 10 |
realization in [16]. In this case, a finite spread exists in the natural frequency distribution of the
fictitious oscillators, which sets the threshold for the synchronization transition. â€œ3
We note that a similar coupling between the optical field and the motion of atoms can also :B
arise in the context of cooperative scattering of light by an optically thick cloud of atoms [32]. <
It is possible to derive the optical forces acting on each atom in an ensemble of N atoms :3
including both the quasi-resonant radiation pressure (dominant close to the atomic resonance) :
as well as the optical dipole forces (more relevant for larger detuning) [33]. In contrast to
the situation considered in this paper, in [32,33] these forces arise from direct dipole-dipole
coupling between atoms and are not mediated via a propagation and feedback through a mirror.
Furthermore, we expect that synchronization between different atoms not only manifests itself in
the motional degrees of freedom, but also can affect the internal degrees of freedom of the atoms,
leading to synchronized cooperative scattering of a large cloud. Such cooperative scattering was : =
