Different languages will employ different weightings of these
(see for instance [50-52]). In some languages, there will be
relatively sharp steps down or up in prominence between suc-
cessive syllables—giving on average a steep mean pairwise
prominence gradient; in others the gradient will be much shal-
lower. The concept of a dichotomy, or continuum, between
stress-timing and syllable-timing is thus replaced by a conti-
nuum based on global properties of prominence alternation
within a language. In attempting to capture trends in the promi-
nence gradient, the PVI has a clear affinity with the contrastive
view of speech rhythm and, therefore, a theoretical foundation
which we believe is more explicit than in the case of other indi-
ces. However, neither this affinity, nor the fact that a PVI value
can always be generated, resolves the question of whether
speech is rhythmic by design, as will be discussed in §7.

the syllable in bold was increased or decreased from the orig-
inal by 35% in duration and three semitones in pitch, yielding
nine versions including those replicating original values in
each dimension. Subjects were presented with a 3 x 3 ran-
domized array of the stimuli for each sentence, and had to
listen to all until they could make a decision as to which
was ‘rhythmically most natural’.
