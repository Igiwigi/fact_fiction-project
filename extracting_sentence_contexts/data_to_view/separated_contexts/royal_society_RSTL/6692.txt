It is exceedingly difficult to follow an individual fibre for any distance in the trunk of
a nerve. I have seen nerve-fibres dividing in the trunks near to ganglia, and on two! or
three occasions I have almost convinced myself that one of the fibres resulting from the
subdivision passed to a ganglion-cell, while the other passed on in. the trunk of the nerve;
but I have not succeeded in preserving an undoubted specimen of ach an arrangement. The difficulty of following one individual fibre is much increased by the fact that the
nerves, vary 80 much in thickness within a very short distance. Dark-bordered fibres
may be very distinct, and within a distance of two thousandths of an inch may be 80 thin
as to be scarcely demonstrable, swelling out again a little further on. This renders it
necessary to isolate an individual fibre from its neighbours' before its course: can. be
traced with positive certainty for any great distance.
