closer to zero. This means that the modulation period is higher and the peaks of the solution are
well separated. The shape of each peak is close to the Peregrine breather profile. The amplitude
amplification in this case is close to three. Similar AB-like dynamics, referred to as solitons on
finite background, has been previously observed in water waves [44]. In addition to the effects
related to the group velocity shifts, we can also note an asymmetry of the surface wave profiles
due to higher order dispersion effects and to the mean flow. These are not taken into account in
the NLS wave dynamics [45].

The amplitude amplifications predicted in theory and reached in the experiments above
related to both KM solitons and ABs, are summarized in the table 1. Generally, there is better
agreement with the NLS solutions with smaller wave steepness and smaller nonlinearity [46].
We can see that the maximal experimental values for the surface elevations are indeed a slightly
higher than the ones predicted in theory. Again, this is due to the fact that the surface elevation
described in terms of NLS solution on finite background can be considered as a free surface
