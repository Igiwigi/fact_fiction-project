rate of rhythm. either of ventricle or auricles is produced ; the rate of the auricular
beats continues the same ; the ventricular beat follows upon each auricular with the
game regularity as before, and, in fact, as far as the rhythm is concerned the ventricle
might not have been heated (Plate 67, fig. 2). That the heating was effective, however,
the figure clearly shows, for the force of the ventricular contractions is markedly
diminished during the time that the muscle was heated : a fact of considerable
importance, as proving that heat acts upon the muscular tissue of the heart in such a
way as to diminish the force of its contractions apart altogether from the rapidity of
the rate of rhythm of those contractions. Q
