SHANKLIN ON THE BRAINS

2 EMINENTIA THALAMI ANTERIOR, figs. 2, 3, E.T. The eminentia thalami of this description corresponds to that described by
Kunienseck (1929), JeEENER (1930, Jdus idus, Clupea harengus, Osmerus eperlanus,
Mormyrus caschive). JEENER called attention to the fact that this is most probably
the homologue of the eminentia thalami described by Herrick (1917) in the urodele
amphibians. In a comparative study of this region, JEENER (1930) failed to find
a differentiated eminentia thalami in the Crossopterygii, in the Dipnoi, in the
Chondrostei, nor in the Holostei. In Polypterus bichir he found the subhabenular
area occupied by a differentiated pars dorsalis, and a pars ventralis thalami.
