But unless the fixity of external ether be granted, our argument from densit
concerning the value of the internal velocity breaks down. Consider again ty
planes moving with a slab of matter, one inside and one outside the mass, and ]
the space motion of the outside ether at the‘position of outside plane be affected |
the motion of the slab to the extent yv, then all we can say is that

v— yo=n" (v— xv),
or, a
z=1— ow yet
wherefore it is possible for « and y to be unity together. We may take it, however, that the quantitative accuracy of the Fizeau expt
ment renders anything of this sort very unlikely, and that we are bound to supp
the ether immediately outside moving matter to be stationary, i¢., to be 0
pletely unaffected by its motion, unless we are directly forced by facts to admit 1
contrary.
