128 DR. C. H. JONES ON THE STRUCTURE

before it can be received into the excretory duct ; and lastly, if correct, they seem to
establish that the liver is not widely removed from the class of glands destitute of
efferent ducts, like them allowing a part of its elaborated products to return at once
into the blood, from whence as plasma they had been derived. On a future occasion
I trust to have the opportunity of examining more closely into the function of the
liver. I may however at present remark, that if the capillary radicles of the portal
vein absorb the saccharine and amylaceous matters from the intestines, it seems a
wise provision that the blood s0 charged should percolate intimately a vast mass of
cells, which may specially act on the newly-absorbed materials, retain them if they
are in excess, convert them into biliary compounds, and again allow them to return,
as needed, into the circulating current : this in fact is nearly the view proposed by
Messrs. Boucnarpar and SanDRas. I have, lastly, to speak of the relation which the
excretory ducts, before described, hold to the lobules of the parenchyma. As far as
I can ascertain, they do not ramify very extensively, at least both in the Rabbit and
Sheep many fissures appear quite destitute of them ; in those where the margin is in
an active state, the cells bare and discharging their contents, the absence of the duct
may often I think be clearly determined; in others, where the margin is still covered
by the investing membrane, it is more difficult to be certain, but generally I think it
may be stated that they do not extend far beyond the © spaces ;” here however I have
in thin sections several times distinctly observed small ducts which terminated by
closed extremities. In the portal canals small duct branches creep over the surface
of the parietal lobules, and take up their elaborated products. In now endeayouring
to determine the mode in which the biliary secretion formed exterior to the ducts
