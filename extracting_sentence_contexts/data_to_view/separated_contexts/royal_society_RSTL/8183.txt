These properties may, however, be also interpreted according to the view already given
(see Section 5, p. 532), that in all wires of iron under such circumstances the axes of the
molecules lie in a spiral direction with regard to the axis of the wire, and are therefore
in a position to be moved by the influence either of a longitudinally or tangentially
magnetizing force.

'The view that the two conditions are to some extent distinct and independent agrees

with the fact that a 8uwitably powerful coil-current at once removes and reverses the
rexiduary longitudinal magnetic polarity in a soft iron wire, but only gradually removes
the residual effect of an axial current, and does not at all reverse it (se Section 27). Bach axial current also transmits its own characteristic influence through several
subsequent coil-current changes, and each coil-current similarly through axial-current
changes, in a kind of hereditary manner.

34. The condition produced in iron and steel by an axial current.

'The experiments generally described in this paper show conclusively that the mag-
netism produced in iron by an axial-electric current is distributed very differently from
that in a cross section of an ordinary electromagnet ; it also arises from an influence
within the iron, whereas the latter is produced by one from without.
