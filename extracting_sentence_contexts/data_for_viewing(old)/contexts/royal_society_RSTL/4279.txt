there may be, as maintained by MM. p'Arxcaiac and Hains (op. cit. p. 69), such a

43. Reproduction.—The mode of Reproduction of the Foraminifera generally, is at
present involved in the deepest obscurity ; and there is little probability that it will
be fully elucidated by any other means, than continued observation of the animals in-
their living state, 8uch as may probably be best carried out with regard to the species
of our own seas by keeping them in Vivaria. In default of such observations, and as
a guide to further inquiry, I think it as well to state what has fallen under my own
notice. In many parts of the body of spirit-specimens of Orbitolite,—especially, but
not solely, in the superficial cells,—I have found the sarcode broken-up as it were into
