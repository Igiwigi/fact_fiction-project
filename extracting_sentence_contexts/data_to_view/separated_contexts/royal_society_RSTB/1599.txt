The peenliar ventral process which, on
each side, grows out from the yentro-lateral edge of the complex centrum may also,
with some probability, be regarded as due to the extension of bony deposit from the
superficial ossifications of the complex centrum into the superficial fibrous coat,

But while retaining in a fashion the usnal rigid skeletal attachments the relations
of the walls of the air-sacs te the moyable tripodes afford further indications of the
effects of degeneration, We entertain no doubt, of the practical atrophy of the
dorsal wall of each sae, and the almost complete disappearance of the usual strata
of fibres by which, in fhe normal anterior chamber, the lateral and antero-loteral
walls are functionally connected with the tripodes. With the suppression of these
fibres the absence of the peculiar crescentic curvature in the posterior division of the
tripus niust be associated,

We shall subsequently huve oceasion to discuss these fits from a physiological
point of view, and we shall now merely remark that in owr opinion if is quite ¢lear,
from the partial enclosure of the two air-sacs within hony eapsnles, eowlined with the
skeletal attachments of their anterior, posterior, and ventral walls, that no volimetric

changes in the internal capacity of the sacs can possibly occur, except in the direction
of the Jong axis of each through movements of its outer wall; and even if distension
ov contraction should take place in the latter direction, it is impossible that any
motion could be imparted to the tripodes, by reason of the atrophy of the dorsal walls
and the now-existence of the usual fibrous tracts by which such an effect is normally
brought about. The extremely diminutive size of the air-bladder, when compared
with the bull of the Fish, taken in conjunction with such facts in the structure of
the organ as those indicated above, force us to adopt the conclusion that the air-

” Ih our necessarily imperfect account of Akysis and Acrochordonichthys there were
Sseveral interesting points that we were unable to determine with certainty, of which
Sthe most important were, the condition of the dorsal walls of the ait-sacs, and the
Spresence or abserice of a sinus endolymphaticus. We cannot but think, however,
that our tentative conclusions with regard to those genera derive considerable support
from the resulis of our inyestigations of G/yptosternum and Bageaius, From the
‘Sstrong resemblance between the four genera in all essential osteological details, as well
in the general structure and skeletal attachments of their air-sucs, and in the
‘Scondition of the Weberian ossicles, we now entertain but little doubt that, so far as
re Ahysis and Acrochordonichthys are concerned, the agreement extends also to the
