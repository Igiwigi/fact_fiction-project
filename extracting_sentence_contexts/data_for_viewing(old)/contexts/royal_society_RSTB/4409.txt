The Curtailment of the Flowering-curve.

A number of causes which may effect this curtailment of the curve have already
been mentioned, such as planting too closely, exhaustion of soil, shortage of water,
and, in rare cases, the autumnal fall of temperature.

In the greater part of the data at present available, however, the cause is simply
root-asphyxiation by the rise of the water-table to the lower roots. The prejudicial
effect of a high water-table had already been demonstrated by AupgBEAU and
Grpson, when the present author pointed out that if a rising water-table was also
injurious, the two together would account for all the known features of the yield
deterioration which the Egyptian cotton crop was showing. It was, however, by no
means easy to carry conviction in this matter. The fact that fields could be found in
which the plants were loaded with ripe bolls, although the water-table had risen above
the soil-surface, so that these laden plants were standing in a lake, was considered
strong evidence that a rising water-table might be highly beneticial.

The Terraces Experiment was planned by Mr. Huaues in order to obtain data on
this subject, but the plot yields were not conclusive, on account of soil-disturbance,
and our knowledge of daily flowering was not then sutlicient to enable the author to
interpret the data obtained in the observation rows. Moreover, the water-table
conditions were not truly represented by the tube-wells. The only available data
from 1909 for the level of the water-table in the soil surrounding the roots themselves
are the five points plotted in the lower half of fig. 14, from which it is clear that the
water-table had risen much sooner than the well-levels (figured on p. 73 of â€˜The
