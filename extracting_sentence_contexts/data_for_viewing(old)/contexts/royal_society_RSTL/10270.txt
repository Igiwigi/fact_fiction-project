Slargest or smallest would hardly ever have altered the mean by more than 6', and we
*othink the extreme possible error of the mean is not more than 10', The most serious
difficulty was due to the instability of the zero. The two tubes were mounted, as has
Sheen dexcribed, side by ide, and the distance travelled by the interfering rays in
"Sinenclosed air was not more than 30 centims. Owing, however, either to slight
Bhanges in temperature or hygrometric state, or to 80me other undetected cause, the

zzero was continually moving. The motion was generally though not always in one
Adirection. It was very variable in amount. Sometimes it was negligible, sometimes
Bt produced a change of 4* or 5* in as many minutes. Tt is evident that the thickness
f the films, given by any particular experiment, would be greater or less than the true
-2value according as the motion of the zero was, or was not, in the same direction as that
Zproduced by the rupture of the films. The observed facts were in accordance with
Sthis, and the numbers obtained were generally larger or smaller than the mean
Saccording to the direction of the motion of the zero before the experiment. If there-
SÅ¿ore the motion remained constant during observations made on the two tubes, the
=results given by each would be oppositely affected, and the mean value would be
Scorrect. Kyen if, as was the case, it was impossible to ensure snch constaney, the
Zerror of the mean would probably be much less than that of the individual observa-
Stions. In all our experiments, therefore, the result of each was taken to be the mean
of the numbers obtained by breaking the films first in one tube, and then in the other.
S The following are the details of the last experiment performed with the liquide
Nycerique. The zero was on this occagion remarkably steady.
