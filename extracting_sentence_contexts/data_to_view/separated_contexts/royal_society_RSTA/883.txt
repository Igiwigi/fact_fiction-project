The relative efficiency of the various oils in reducing the friction depends upon
the load between the surfaces. The fact that oleic acid gives less friction than

triolein is consistent with the observation that a fatty acid is more effective than a
glyceride oil in increasing the lubricating efficiency of a mineral oil. We are greatly indebted to the late Sir Witt1am Harpy for his interest and
encouragement in the work, to the Commissioners of the Exhibition of 1851 for an
Overseas Scholarship (to W. G. B.) and to the Lubrication Research Committee of
the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research for a grant for apparatus (to
Beeb) SUMMARY

A method is described for the measurement of kinetic friction between highly
polished surfaces.
