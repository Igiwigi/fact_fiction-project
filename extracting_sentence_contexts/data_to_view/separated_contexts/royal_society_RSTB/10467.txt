Within each box, we list the characteristics/metrics associated with each of these
topics. Arrows indicate likely causal relationships, which in some cases may be bi-directional (e.g. between forest status and social-economic conditions). We rep-
resent the fact that social-economic conditions mediate the relationship between vectors and malaria (e.g. through changes in housing conditions and access to
healthcare) by having its arrow pointing to another arrow. (Online version in colour.)

sectional surveys where all individuals are tested with very
study sensitive and specific diagnostic methods (e.g. polymerase
