There are certain difficulties connected with this interpretation in its original form. It is
not easy to see what justification there is for supposing that the addition of an electron to an
O, molecule makes only a small difference to the electronic energy of the system over the
region of the potential minimum. If it does, in fact, do so, it must be regarded rather as
fortuitous and by no means obvious. Further, Weiss (1935) has roughly estimated the
electron affinity of O, by applying the method of the Born cycle to certain electrolytic
reactions and finds a value of 2-7 eV. Although the error involved in this estimate is probably
large owing to the lack of precise information concerning a number of the energies involved,
it is difficult to reconcile with Bloch & Bradbury’s value of not more than 0-17eV.+ Thus
Weiss applied his method also to obtain the electron affinity of OH, and the value he derived,
3-7 eV, is quite comparable with the 2-1 eV obtained by Goubeau & Klemm (1937) from
a study of cyclic processes involving the alkali hydroxides.

Loeb (1935) has attempted to obtain direct experimental evidence as to the magnitude
of the energy required to detach electrons from the negative ions formed in a high-frequency
discharge in oxygen, by collisions with oxygen gas molecules. Quantitative analysis of his
