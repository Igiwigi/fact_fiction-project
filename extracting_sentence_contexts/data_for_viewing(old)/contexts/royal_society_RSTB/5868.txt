smaller in both types of brains.

{ As the temporal perpendicular tends to shift forward with the development of the temporal lobe the
discrepancy between this junction and this perpendicular becomes still larger.

402 ARIENS KAPPERS ON SOME CORRELATIONS BETWEEN SKULL AND BRAIN.

The high callosum index of infants, and newborns, is correlated with the relatively
greater height of the brain at this period. Its later decrease may be influenced by an
increase of fibres and especially by the fact that the size of the myeline sheaths in the
callosum of the adults is about four times more than at birth (DoNALDson, 1912),* this
chiefly affects the length of the callosum as it does in the mammalian series.

Where a lunate sulcus was evident in my specimens of newborns or infants its position
was a rather frontal one and its form a pronounced vertical crescent ; this may be due to
the relatively further extension of the striate area on the convexity and lesser
development of the parietal region.

A striking feature of the foetal and infantâ€™s brain is the downward course of the
posterior calearine, which is later lifted up by the development of the ventral peri- and
para-striate area. This also contributes to cause its dorsal hook, so frequently found in the
adult. The increase of the precuneus causes the gradual decrease of the parieto-occipital
