Immediately, however, that they enter the cellular web,
between the articular cartilage and synovial membrane, they become enlarged and
straight, and pass to a greater or less distance over the border of the articular car-
tilage, forming loops frequently with considerable dilatations, and becoming finally
continuous with the veins. The free surface of adult articular cartilage appears to
be nourished by the liquor sanguinis, which exudes from these looped and dilated
vessels. 'The following are the leading facts which the preceding researches upon Articular
Cartilage tend to establish :â€”

1. Epiphysal and articular cartilage are developed and nourished in the early
periods of foetal existence, without the presence of blood-vessels in the substance of
the former, or on the surface of the latter. 2.
