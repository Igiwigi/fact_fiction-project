In V, however, the agreement
is distinctly better at Katharinenburg than at Pawlowsk. In the case of the absolute daily range the agreement between observed and
calculated values is particularly good in D, and it is closer in all the elements than at
Pawlowsk. This may be ascribed to the fact that magnetic disturbances are larger
at Pawlowsk than at Katharinenburg. The difference between the observed and calculated values in the monthly range
is somewhat large, and there is now clear indication that sun-spot frequency is not
by itself a sufficient guide. The observed values in 1893 are conspicuously below,
and those in 1892 and 1894 conspicuously above, the calculated.
