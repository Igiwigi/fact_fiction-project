MPI excitation has,
however, an unexpected advantage over the VUV detection related to the Franck—Condon factors. As Pratt and co-workers state, the vibrational frequency of the v2 umbrella mode in the ion
is nearly double than that in the neutral. This fact implies that the Franck-Condon envelope
spreads over a broad range of vibrational levels in the ion, and that the range will increase as the
vibrational excitation in the neutral is increased. Because the VUV photon energy is only approx. :
5170cm~! above the ionization threshold for CH3, as the vibrational excitation is increased, an [=
increasing fraction of the Franck-Condon envelope will become energetically inaccessible, which 5
will reduce in turn the total photoionization cross-section. MPI excitation provides, in principle, :
as much energy above the ionization threshold as needed—either through the photon energy or Da
through the number of photons—and, therefore, selection of favoured ro-vibrational states should :
not be limited by energetic arguments. 74
