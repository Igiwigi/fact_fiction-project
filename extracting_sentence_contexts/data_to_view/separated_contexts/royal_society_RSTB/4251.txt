Usually
8 originating as single free strands, they are subject to minor variations. Near their
terminations in the sub-endocardial spaces overlying the papillary muscles they
3 break up into a complex basketwork. These chief facts are illustrated in the
5 accompanying diagrams, where free strands encased in endocardium are indicated by

iP unbroken lines, and where the remaining visible outlines of the fun are represented
4 by broken lines.

e In cutting the left division I use a small tenotomy knife, introducing it, as did
3 Eprrncer and Rorapercer, from the ventral and left surface of the left ventricle.
= The point chosen is the erutch formed by the descending branch of the left coronary
g artery at its union with its chief branch, an artery which runs down toward the left
3 and dorsal surfaces of the heartâ€™s apex. The knife is driven cleanly in between the
gs two arteries, ina dorsal direction, with an inclination to the right; it enters the
5 cavity $-1 em. below the left anterior aortic cusp (see fig. 7), and in the space
g between the mitral valve and septum. The point is carried back until the dorsal
a border of the system is reached, when the cutting surface is opposed to the septum.
