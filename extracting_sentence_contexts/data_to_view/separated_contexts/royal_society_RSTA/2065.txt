Looked at from this point of view, (iii) is largely
identical with (iv). We are thus almost inevitably driven to the conclusion (iv), that the method of
approximation is unsound. Now examination of the expressions (19.1), (19.2) will show
that the most important terms in our second approximation for the velocities are, in fact,
of smaller order than the most important terms in the first approximation. Thus away from the tail the most important terms of second order are of magnitude
r~*‚Äù, those of the first order of magnitude 7~'; in the tail the most important terms of
second order are of magnitude (log 7/r), those of the first order of magnitude r~*. There
is thus, so far as we have gone, no apparent failure of convergency.
