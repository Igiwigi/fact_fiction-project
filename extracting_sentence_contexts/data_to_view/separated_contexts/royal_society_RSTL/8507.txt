It will rotate steadily at speeds varying from
1 revolution in 6 minutes (in the light of the full moon) to 240 revolutions in a minute
(in the strongest light I have been able to obtain). When the mill is revolving, and the light is suddenly extinguished, it rapidly comes
to rest. These two facts, namely (1) that the mill rapidly arrives at its maximum velocity
when the light is turned on, and (2) that it as rapidly comes to rest when the light is
turned off, are those to which I wish first to direct attention, for they appear to me
to prove conclusiyely that the air within the envelope does exercise influence on the mill. (1) If it were true, as has been supposed, that the best results are obtained in a
vacuum 80 perfect that there is not sufficient air to exercise any influence on the vanes
of the mill, then it follows that the mill would move without experiencing any-resistance
from the air, and the only known resistance would be the friction of the pivot.
