But even in the same species the colour may vary without assignable
cause. Normally, this coloured mass in the ferment cell is finely granular, and the
granules may be collected into secondary spherical masses within the primary one,
e.g.,in Maja. FRenzet describes departures from the typical appearance of these
cells, which no doubt are due to the fact that we cannot draw hard and fast lines
between the two kinds of cells. Indeed, as Lane in his “ Comparative Anatomy”
remarks : “ We cannot also carry out a sharp distinction of the cells into ferment
cells and hepatic cells ; many transition forms occur.”

FreNzEL found crystals in the vesicles of the ferment cells in some Decapods,
notably in Maja and Carcinus, also in Callianassa, Squilla mantis, and Dromia. These crystals were colourless and needle-shaped.
