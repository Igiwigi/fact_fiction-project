The motions are timed in such a way that when the inclination of the orbit to the
ecliptic is at the maximum, the obliquity of the equator to the ecliptic is ab the
minimum, and vice vers.

Now let us call the angular velocity with which the nodes of the orbit would
regrede on the ecliptic, if the earth were spherical, the nodal velocity.

And leb us call the angular velocity with which the common node of the orbit and
equator would regrede on the invariable plane of the system, if the sun did nob exist,
the precessional velocity.

If the various obliquities and inclinations be not large, the precessional velocity is
in fact the purely lunar precession.

Then if the nodal velocity be large compared with the precessional velocity, the
lunar proper plane is inclined at a small angle to the ecliptic, and the equator is
inclined at a small angle to the earth's proper plane.

This is the case with the earth, moon, and sun at, present, because the nodal period
is about 184 years, and the purely lunar precession would have a period of between
20,000 and 30,000 years. Tt is not usnal to speak of a proper plane of the earth,
because it is more simple to conceive a mean equator, about which the true equator
nutates with a period of about 184 years.

Here the precessional motion of the two proper planes is the whole luni-solar
