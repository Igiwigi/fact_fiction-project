structures. Referring to the vascularity of the septum in Phascolarctus, GREGORY fails
to see that Bork has proved anything beyond the possibility of nutriment being carried
via the septum to the crown of the tooth, and, since it is distributed on each side of the
septum, two growth centres appear in the enamel organ. While Grecory does not
advance any explanation for the presence of the enamel niche, he suggests that it may
represent a secondary vacuity developed in the dental lamina.

Finally, BoLk attempted to derive the diphyodont condition of the mammalian
dentition from the polyphyodonty of the reptiles by showing that the latter possessed
a “‘distichical”’ dentition and that in the mammals the “‘ exostichos”’ (whose members
always form first in the embryo) erupt first as the milk dentition, to be followed later
by the endostichical elements which become the permanent teeth. The “exostichos”’
and “‘endostichos”’ are differentiated by the fact that the members of the former row
develop as “ parietal’? enamel organs on the lateral side of the dental lamina, while the
latter are formed at the extremity of the dental lamina as “‘terminal”’ enamel organs.

That the teeth of fish, amphibians and reptiles do alternate is well recognized, and
such alternation appears to be an inherent and ancient property of the epidermis. It is
present in the teeth and scales of modern sharks, it is seen in the teeth of the osteolepids,
and again in the earliest tetrapods, the labyrinthodonts. PARRINGTON (1936) has
recently shown that a “‘distichical”’ condition is present in the postcanine teeth of
certain cynodont reptiles.

Whether these exostichical and endostichical rows become functionally independent
and erupt with a long interval between them to give the ‘“‘chorisstichic’”’ dentition of
