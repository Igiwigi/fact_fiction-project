The tabulated mean radius is 0Â°01235. These minute haloes abound in the Carlow mica. In fact in places the clear mica
is dusted over, as it were, with the black nuclear specks around which these haloes
are formed, the delicate rings interlacing and overlapping in actual confusion. Some are, as already stated, so faint as to be hardly detectable. Others are well
defined discs, the earliest formed part of the halo appearing as a darker border to
the disc.
