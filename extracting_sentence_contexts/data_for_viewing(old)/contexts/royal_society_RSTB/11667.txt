Christoph J. Volter The combination of the comparative method (i.e. comparing relevant traits
e-mail: qv3@st-andrews.ac.uk across species) and analysing individual differences has proved to be a

powerful approach to elucidate the evolution of physical traits. In principle,
understanding the evolution of cognition can benefit from a similar approach.
However, the study of cognitive evolution is complicated by the fact that cogni-
tion cannot be directly measured; instead, it must be inferred from measuring
the physical substrate that underpins it (the brain) and its expression (behav-
iour) [1]. Initial theories of cognitive evolution were based on differences in
relative brain size between taxa and correlations with various socio-ecological
factors such as group size [2—4] and dietary diversity [3,5]. Although brain
size is a crude index of cognitive ability [6], it does correlate with observational
records of behaviour, such as tool use, social learning and innovation, in both
mammals and birds [7,8]. Nevertheless, it has proved difficult to discriminate
between theories for cognitive evolution based on this indirect evidence [9].
A satisfying account of cognitive evolution must describe the trait that is
evolving more precisely.
