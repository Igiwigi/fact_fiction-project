The physiological action of ether has received considerable attention lately, and a
few points in connection with it are of sufficient importance as bearing upon our
experiments to warrant a more detailed notice.

In the first place, it has been shown (Hoopmr, Semon and Horstry, Bowptrcs,
and others) that ether when present in the circulating blood through inhalation,
appears to have a distinctly differential effect upon the two kinds (red and white) of
muscle, or upon their innervation, 7.¢., centres, fibres, or nerve endings.

Further that the direct application of the liquid or vapour of ether to the trunk ofa
nerve causes paralysis of its physiological conductivity.* (Hoopmr and BrepERMANN.)

The investigations of FLourEnst in 1847 had elicited the fact that the inhalation
of ether produced physiological effects, in which the functional activity of the reflex
centres was abolished before that of the conducting nerve paths, and this has been
substantiated by the work of other investigators.

It is with special reference to the action of ether upon these two structures that
the present remarks are introduced, since, with the exception of the few experi-
ments in which we employed the graphic method, our work has been entirely confined
to the study of the changes in nerve centres and nerve fibres.

It was consequently of primary importance for us to know to what extent the
inhalation of ether has a differential action upon nerve centres as distinct from nerve
fibres. ’
