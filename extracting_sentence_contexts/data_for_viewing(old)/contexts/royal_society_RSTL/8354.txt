near the edge of the glass. The jar was placed upon a table, and suffered to stand a
considerable time to cool in a room without fire. I then sat near it on the side where
one of the holes in the paper was in the nearer and the other in the farther end of the
diameter. I next filled another glass with smoke, and placed it with its mouth oyer *
the two holes in the paper. The 8moke was now seen to descend through the farthest
hole, and mixing with the air in the lower jar, plainly showed that the air moyed slowly
towards the side of the glass warmed by the heat of my body.

Â« Experiment X. To the end of a fine gold wire 3 inches long, and suspended by a
spider's thread in a cylindrical glass, was fastened a small circular bit of writing-paper ;

a
REPULSION RESULTING FROM RADIATION. 503

light was admitted through a 8mall hole, and also the focus of a large lens was thrown
upon the paper, with the intention of observing whether it would be moved by the
impulse of light; but though these experiments were often repeated, and once with the
paper suspended in an exhausted receiver, yet I could not perceive any motion distin-
guishable from the effects of heat. Perhaps sensible heat, and light may not be caused
by the influx or rectilinear projection of fine particles, but by the vibrations made in
the universally diffused caloric or matter of heat or fluid of light. I think modern dis-
