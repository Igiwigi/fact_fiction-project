The pigment was fully diffused before the experiment was performed, and remained 86
afterwards in the area squeezed, while it became concentrated elsewhere, and this was
the condition of things when the drawing was made. The concomitant differences in
tint between the blood in the affected and the 8ound parts in consequence of the accumy-
lation of closely packed red discs in the former, are also strikingly shown in the sketch®,

The galyanic shock, too, produced no effect apparent to the eye upon the pigment of
the parts in which it caused stagnation of the blood, but experiments afterwards made
showed me that, like ammonia, it exerted a paralysing agency both upon the concen
trating and the diffusive powers; -and the same results ensued on the application of dry
heat in the cases mentioned in the last section. From these and other similar facts it appeared that mustard, croton oil, and cantha»
rides are exceptional as regards the diffusion to which they give rise, the usnal course
being that irritants, when applied 80/as to produce stagnation of the blood, suspend at
the same time both the functions of the pigment-cells. It afterwards turned out that mustard was, in reality, no exception to this general
rule. Subsequent experiments showed that diffusion takes place to very different degrees
in different instances under the action of this substance, but that in all cases, after
reaching a certain point, it becomes incapable of advancing further in the irritated part,
however much it may increase in the body generally, in case of the animal changing to
a darker colour.
