As such, it poses a new challenge to the notion that humans can act freely.

The tendency for scientific advances to reinforce the case for a mechanistic model of ourselves
shows no sign of abatement. In the following, I discuss how my recently introduced quantum
theory of time [10,11] maintains this trend. In particular, the new theory involves a set of states,
each one of which represents a physical system such as a galaxy as existing, in the case of time
reversal symmetry, at one specific time. However, in the case of a violation of time reversal
symmetry (T violation) of the kind observed in particle physics [12,13], the set of states represent
the galaxy as existing at a sequence of increasing times. Each state provides ontological support
for our subjective perception of existing in the present and the ordered sequence of states provides
ontological support for our perception of progressing through time from the past to the future.
The theory may thus appear to be at odds with the block universe for which events at all times
coexist as one entity. However, I argue below that the new theory is, in fact, consistent with the
block universe view. I show that the ordered sequence of states provides a physical basis for some
of our subjective notions about time to be incorporated into the block universe view. It resolves,


therefore, the open problem of how to square the human perspective of time within the block
universe [14]. Yet despite this, it offers no escape from determinism and the mechanistic human.

The organization of the remainder of this paper is as follows. I rework the original
development of the new theory [10] into a set of four basic principles in ยง2 and summarize the
main results of their implementation in ยง3. Next, in ยง4, I interpret the new theory in terms of the
block universe and then, in ยง5, I discuss the implications for how we experience time. I end with
a conclusion.
