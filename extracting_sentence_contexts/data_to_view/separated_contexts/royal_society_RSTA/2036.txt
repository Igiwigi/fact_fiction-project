of magnitude. On the other hand, for the samples based on MVSA polymer (both the solution and
the suspension) G’ dominated over G” (table 2), i.e. a gel-like behaviour was obtained. Another feature observed in figure 4 is the fact that both G’ and G” presented approximately
constant values at low strain amplitude (something that defines the LVR), while showing
decreasing trends at large amplitude (above 100% of strain amplitude), with the drop being more
acute for G’ than for G’’. Concerning the dependence of these quantities with strain frequency
within the LVR, as demonstrated by figure 5, in all cases both log G’ and log G’’ increased almost
linearly with log f, a characteristic that is typical of solutions of polymers measured at low to
medium frequency [12]. Note at this point that the linear trends in double logarithmic scale
observed in figure 5 imply a power-law dependence of the viscoelastic moduli with frequency.
