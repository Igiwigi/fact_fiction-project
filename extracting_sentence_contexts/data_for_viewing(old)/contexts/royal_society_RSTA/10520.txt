mean inequality for the year. In fact, the data from March give a better general
idea of the phenomena than those from any other month.

§ 28. To facilitate comparison of the law of variation throughout the year of the
range and the sum of the 24 differences in the diurnal inequalities of D, 1, H, and V,
T give a synopsis of the whole of the data in Table XVIII. Here each quantity dealt
with is expressed as.a percentage of its mean value for the 12 months. This enables
us to see more readily points of agreement and difference. It will be observed that
there is a close resemblance between the annual variations in D, I, and H, and that
the mean of the results from these three elements for the range and for the sum of
fhe 24 differences are very similar. On the whole, the sum of the 24 differences has

the more accentuated annual variation.
