Specifically,
Hutchinson [66] studies the role of substrate nonlinearity in the stability of wrinkling of thin
films bonded to compliant substrates; the initial post-bifurcational range is investigated. He
shows that the substrate pre-stretch has a significant effect on the nonlinearity, relevant to
wrinkling. This investigation was motivated by the fact that in many film-substrate systems,
compressive buckling of the film into wrinkling mode is undesirable. For the neo-Hookean
elasticity, the author uncovers fold-like or ridge-like wrinkle shapes. Substrate nonlinearity leads
also to a transition of a periodic wrinkle pattern to one alternating between highly localized
undulations and relatively flat regions.
