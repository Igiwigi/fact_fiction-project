The other two
facts define the role and the relation of the quantum states of individual and composite systems in
a way that does not invoke density matrices (to which we are not entitled in the absence of Born’s
Rule). Thus, phase shift ug ® 1e = (| Tt | + | LL |) @ Ie acting on a pure pre-decoherence
state matters: measurement can reveal g. In accord with facts 1 and 2, ug changes a| t) + A] |) into

S alone, as it can be undone by 1s ® (let er| +e” ley Ney), a countershift acting on a faraway,

S is not acted upon (so that, by fact 1, it remains unchanged).
