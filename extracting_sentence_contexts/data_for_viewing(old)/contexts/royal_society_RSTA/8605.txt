examination of these, but it is clear that they do not bear any relation to the Swan
bands. We have, therefore, practically no knowledge of the electronic energy levels of the
HC-CH molecule, except such as we may infer by a comparative study with similarly
constituted molecules (see Section XIII).

Mutual Action between Rotation and Oscillation.—At this stage attention may perhaps
be drawn to this feature, which is illustrated by the data of Table IX. According to
theory, (23) an expression for the total energy of an excited molecule involves not only the
purely vibrational and rotational terms, but also a term due to their mutual influence.
This involves adding to the energy expression a term of the form — m?a,h, or it is simply
accounted for by writing instead of A’ = h/87*I’ the term h/82*I’ — aw, and instead
of h/8r*1’” the term h/8721"’ — ay. To a first approximation we may regard the correc-
tion as linear, and write a, = «'n’ and a,,=«'’n’. In Table IX these facts are illus-
trated : A” diminishes as n” increases and A’ diminishes as n’ increases. Approximately
I have estimated «’=0:03, «” =0-025. As a consequence, C = A’— A” =
(h/8r21’ — h/8221") — (0-03n’ — 0-025") shows a decrease as 7’ increases, an increase
as n” increases, and a slight decrease as we travel along a sequence An = a constant.

A little consideration shows that theoretically we should expect an increase in I when
vibration of the nuclei sets in. For the effect of oscillation will be to cause each nucleus
to travel in an undulating path instead of a circle, and a time average of the square of
the distance between the nuclei (upon which I depends) will necessarily be greater than
in the vibrationless state.
