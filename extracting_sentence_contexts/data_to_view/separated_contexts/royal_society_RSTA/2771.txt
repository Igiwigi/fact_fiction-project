The system can still transition as a result of a finite
amplitude perturbation that causes it to cross a seperatrix between distinct modes [104-106]. All :
system parameters (e.g. internal energy, lithosphere strength) can remain constant in the process. :=
Finite amplitude instabilities can occur in a range of physical systems (e.g. [118]). The fact that :3
subduction initiation was argued to be a finite amplitude instability [119] suggests that the idea :
of multiple stable tectonic modes has been lurking in the background for some time. If subduction DB
initiation is a finite amplitude instability, then the existence and non-existence of subduction are :
both viable under equivalent conditions. Although subduction need not lead to plate tectonics 4
(it is not sufficient), plate tectonics does require subduction (it is necessary).
