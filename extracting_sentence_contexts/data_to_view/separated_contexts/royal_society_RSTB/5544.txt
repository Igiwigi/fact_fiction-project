It is obvious that with a continuous flow of water to bathe the branchial
filaments, no sucker can be formed on the ventral surface of the animal. The sucker

progressive series of adaptations for life in swift currents. It has been pointed out

Dryops and Psephenus there is a “ close correlation between the degree of flattening
of the body and the rate of flow of the water inhabited.” This series could be made
