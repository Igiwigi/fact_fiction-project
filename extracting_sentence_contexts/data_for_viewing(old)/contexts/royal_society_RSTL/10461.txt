No. 1. When TI firs} thought of supersaturation, T regarded this agreement of
mperature-coefficient as an argument on the other side, nob at that time recog-
nising, the probable occurrence of the lower hydrate. But what will still more arrest
attention is the agreement of Dr. ALverR WriGnrt's cells with No. 1. There are
Zrame irregularities, possibly dependent upon imperfect penetration of temperature
Sthrough the masses of paraftin in which the cells are imbedded ; but there is no
Sdlistinet evidence of a lower coefficient, and certainly no such difference as that
\Zbotwoon -0008 per degree Cent. and 0004. The same may be eaid of Mz, which I
received from Dr. ALpeR WRIGHT.
SZ $ 53. The absolute variations with temperature of (1), (10), (39), (40) are shown
Sin Table XV., in which all the electro-motive forces are expressed in terms of (38)
Eat 51* F., a s8mall correction being introduced to allow for the 1? or 2®, by which the
Factual temperature of (38), (35), may have differed from 51%, The coefficients for (1)
- and (10) are almost identical. The observed values for (1) agree pretty well with the
formula '
*9970{1 —©000425(t—57)},

as will be seen from the adjoining column calculated therefrom. This is in
Fahrenheit degrees. The corresponding formula in Centigrade degrees is
-9970{1—-000765(t—13*9)}.

It appears, therefore, that the temperature-coefficient for these cells, including those of
Dr. Atver Wrrcnr, is '00077, and that the observed values are utterly irreconcilable
with 8uch a coefficient as 0004.
