The most
Sbvious analogy is that of nyctitropic plants, in which continuous darkness brings the
â€˜eaves into a fixed position which resembles rather the day than the night position.
he existence of some degree of periodicity in the diurnal variation of the stomata
@nds probability to this view. In itself it is not an explanation of the fact, since we
Flo not know what is the cause of the analogous behaviour of sleeping leaves. It is,
owever, a classification of the fact that seems to me more satisfactory than the quasi-
anechanical treatment which is often applied to the stoma problem.
& It may, however, be better to look at the problem in a more simple and direct manner,
As Leirces has done. Het has called attention to the variable result which follows pro-
gonged darkness. The case of Viola lutea, described by him, seems to resemble my
esults, inasmuch as the stomata gradually opened during several days.
