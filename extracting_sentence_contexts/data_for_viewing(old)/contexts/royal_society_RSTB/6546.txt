are formed in much the same way as the corresponding ducts in the female (vide
supra).

An important point in regard to the development of the genital ducts of insects
has been the formation of the so-called coelomic ampullae in the abdomen. They
have been found in several Orthoptera (HEymons, 1891, 1895, a ; WHEELER, 1893 ;
Wiesmann, 1926), in Chalicodoma (CArrtire and Bircer, 1897), in Eutermes
(STRINDBERG, 1913), and in Pyrrhocoris apterus (SEIDEL, 1924). In a number of these
insects the gonad rudiments extend over almost the entire length of the abdomen,
and subsequently a secondary contraction of this extent occurs. Also the coelomic
ampullae are more or less segmentally arranged in the abdomen and one pair of
them usually forms the termination of the mesodermal section of the genital ducts.
These facts give support to the view, as pointed out by Semet (1924) and WirsMANN
(1926), that in the ancestors of insects the gonads stretched throughout the length
of the abdomen and that they opened to the outside by means of segmentally-
arranged ducts.

The development and homologies of the insect genitalia is a very vexed question.
The various views regarding it have been dealt with by Net (1929), and summarized
and critically discussed by Imms (1931). From a survey of the literature it becomes
evident that our knowledge in this direction rests to-day almost entirely on the
comparative morphology of the adults and in some cases on a study of the post-
embryonic development. While such important questions as whether some of
the abdominal appendages are directly converted into the genitalia, and if so which,
can be solved satisfactorily only by a close study of the late embryos, such studies
