We may now show that, when 7 is even,

ae
2B, (0, @) = (-)? “aii (o,"-? ap ow"),

2n

a simple expression for the even double Bernoullian numbers which corresponds in
some degree to the fact that the even simple Bernoullian numbers vanish. On differentiating with regard to a the result of the previous paragraph we find

25’ (@|@,, 2) + (—)' 8',(@, + @, — a) = 0. From the fundamental difference equations we have

Wu (@ + @, + oy) — Sn (a + 0) — S, (4 + 3) + 8, (a) =
