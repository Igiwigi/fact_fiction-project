ML methods (in this case, recurrent neural : =
networks) have also shown themselves capable of reproducing a time series from canonical 1B
chaotic systems with predictability beyond what dynamical systems theory would suggest, e.g. :2
[55] (which indeed explicitly makes a claim to be ‘model-free’), [56]. Does this mean we have come 8
full circle on the von Neumann revolution, and return to forecasting from pattern recognition : 4
rather than physics? The answer of course is contingent on the presumption that the training data De
in fact is comprehensive and samples all possible states of the system. For the Earth system, this : Ss
is a dubious proposition, as there is variability on all time scales, including those longer than the : =
observational record itself. A key issue for all data-driven approaches is that of generalizability 1m

beyond the confines of the training data.
