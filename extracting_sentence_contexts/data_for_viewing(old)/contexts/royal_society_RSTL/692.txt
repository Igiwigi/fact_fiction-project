to ascertain a Standard of Weight and Measure. 157

weighed at a greater depth, by 1,2 inch, than the cube, below
the surface of the water. Now, if it be true that water is com-
pressible,* it will become denser, from its weight, at different
depths, and this circumstance would act in the same way with
that just mentioned; 77x. would make the apparent weight of a
cubic inch less from the experiment of the cube: than the cylin-
der, which we see is the fact.

($. 25.) In order to dissipate these doubts, I caused a very accu-
rate hollow brass sphere to be made, of about six inches diameter,
and of such thickness of metal, viz. 0,13 inch, as to be very little
heavier than water, and yet of such strength as, together with
its form, to resist any probable change of bulk by the pressure
of water.

This sphere, which has already. been mentioned, ($. 10.)
was examined in the following manner. The six-inch move-
able bar 7, (Tab. V. fig. g.) of the gauge, was compared with
the divided scale of inches, fig. 1. The microscopes being ad-
