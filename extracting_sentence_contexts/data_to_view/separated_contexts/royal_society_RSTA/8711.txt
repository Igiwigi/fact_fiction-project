But when interrupted at 4n as represented in (d), there
is a resultant current due to the odd positive elements. This is the third order sub-
harmonic, and it will be seen by comparing (b) and (d) that it has one-third the magnitude
of the fundamental. The presence of these subharmonics is not so objectionable in practice as one might
expect, in fact their frequencies and relative magnitudes have on certain occasions
assisted in the identification of the fundamental with which they are associated. There
is a close analogy with grating spectra, inasmuch as each subharmonic corresponds to
a spectrum of a different order. The even orders are absent just as in a grating where
the opaque and transparent parts of the grating-element are equal in width.
