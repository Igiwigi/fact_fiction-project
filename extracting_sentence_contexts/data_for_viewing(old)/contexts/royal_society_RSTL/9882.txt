The remarkable character of hydrogen is its stiffness. Tt obey's Maxwerrs law
almost absolutely up to an exhaustion of about 700 M. To this point the line of
viscosity is almosb perfectly vertical. It then commences to curve over, and when
the mean free path begins to assume proportions comparable with the dimensions of
the bulb, and approaches infinity, the viscosity curve in like manner draws near the

zero line.

691. The repulsive force of radiation is higher in hydrogen than in any other gas.
It commences at as low an exhaustion as 14 millims., but does not increase to any
great extent till an exhaustion of 200 M is attained ; it then rises rapidly to a maxi-
mum at between 40 and 60 M, after which it falls away to zero. The maximum
repulsion exerted by radiation in hydrogen is to that in air as 70 to 42'6. This fact
is now utilised in the construction of radiometers and similar instruments when great
sensitiveness Is required,

692. Taking the viscosity of air at 760 millims, as 0'1124, and hydrogen as 0-0499,
the proportion between them is 04439, GRAHAM* gives the transpiration time for
hydrogen as 0'4375 taking oxygen as unity, or 0'4855 taking air as unity (706).

693. Professor Clerk MAaxwerrLt found dry hydrogen to be much less viscous than
air, the ratio of its viscosity to that of air being 0:5156. He says, referring to this
result : * It appears, from the experiments of Mr. GRAHAM, that the ratio of the
transpiration time of hydrogen to that of air is 04855, and that of carbonic acid to
air 0807. These numbers are both smaller than those of this paper. I think that
