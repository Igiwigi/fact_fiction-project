1416. Numerous sparks were then passed and carefully obseryed. They were very
rarely straight, but either curved or bent irregularly. In the average of cases they
were, I think, decidedly convex towards each other ; perhaps two thirds presented
more or less of this effect, the rest bulging more or less outwards. I was never able,
however, to obtain sparks which, separately leaving the ends of the wires 2 and o, con-
joined into one spark before they reached or communicated with the ball c. At pre-
sent, therefore, though I think I saw a tendency in the sparks to unite, I cannot as-
sert it as a fact.

1417, But there is one very interesting effect here analogous to, and it may be in
part the same with, that I was searching for: I mean the increased facility of dis-
charge where the spark passes. For instance, in the cases where one end, as 7, dis-
charged the electricity of both ends to the ball c, fig. 2., the electricity of the other
end o, had to pass through an interyal of air 1'5 times as great as that which it might
have taken, by its direct passage between the end and the ball itself, In such cases,
the eye could not distinguish, even by the use of WnzarsToxE's means*, that the
spark from the end », which contained both portions of electricity, was a double
spark, It could not have consisted of two sparks taking separate courses, for such
an effect would havye been visiþble to the eye; but it is just possible, that the spark of
the first end » and its jar, passing at the smallest interval of time before that of the
