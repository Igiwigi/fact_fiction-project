OF SPORANGIA UPON FERN PROTHALLI. 191

parenchymatous cells, which towards the centre are slightly elongated, while the
arrangement of the more superficial cells usually suggests the occurrence of periclinal
divisions. Tracheides are absent in the majority of cases ; their occurrence will be
considered along with instances of apogamy. Fig. 3 represents the transverse section
of a thin cylindrical process. The fact that a normal embryo was occasionally found
on a process shows that the sexual organs are functional. Such a cylindrical process
may continue to grow for a considerable time and attain a length of between one and
two centims. Various modifications may, however, occur. These probably depend
upon changes in the external conditions, although at present the connection can only
be inferred. The process may reassume the form of a flattened prothallus with a
distinct apical depression (fig. 4). This change appears to be favoured by a change
of conditions in the direction of lower temperature, less direct illumination, and,
perhaps, greater humidity of the atmosphere. Many prothalli exhibited it on their
removal from the greenhouse at Kew to a fern case in Glasgow. Under the same
circumstances, gametophytic budding from the surface of the process was frequent ;
the small prothalli usually bore antheridia only.
