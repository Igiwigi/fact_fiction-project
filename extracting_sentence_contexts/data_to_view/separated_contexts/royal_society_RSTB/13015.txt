Therefore, this pre-existing ability to recognize the preferred
niche may in fact ‘hijack’ arising ecological divergence,
protect it, and even further reinforce the newly arising
reproductive isolation by strengthening the assortment. Furthermore, the degree of niche preference does not necess-
arily tightly correlate with the fitness advantage, which the
niche provides to the organism. For example, bacteria
and yeast tend to prefer one food source over all others
(a phenomenon known as a diauxic shift), which in fact
means a 100% preference even if the fitness advantage in
growth rate is only minor [51,52]. In a phytophagous butter-
fly Melitaea cinxia, host plant preference has been observed
but no measurable fitness advantage was detected on the
more preferred host compared to the less preferred one
[53]. In many other cases, a preference-performance corre-
lation has been detected [24,25].
