digestive cavity. The spheroids may often be observed to lie directly upon the ento-
derm cells, and the inner ends of the latter are sometimes produced into small
amceboid processes reaching out, into the digestive cavity, though this is rare.

These appearances suggest, though they do not prove, that the yolk-granules and
spheroids pass bodily into the cells. I have never seen them in the act of passing
into the cells, but the technical difficulties are great, and the other considerations
seem of sufficient weight to warrant the provisional acceptance of the view advanced
above.

This conclusion, if well-founded, is of interest in connexion with recent digcoveries in
regard to intra-cellular digestion in Coelenterata and Turbellaria, 'The occurrence of
such a form of digestion in the sponges has Jong been a familiar fact, and the more recent
researches of MeTSCHNIK OFF, CLAUS, GEGENBAUR, PARKER and Ray LANKESTER have
shown that an essentially similar mode of digestion occurs in the adults of many

Colenterata belonging to the higher groups, namely : in Zydra, Hydroid polyps,
Hydromeduse, Acalephs, Actinize, Ctenophora and Siphonophora. MerscaxIKorr
showed in 1878 that the same remarkable process takes place in a number of fresh
water Turbellaria, and he has ascribed to it an important phylogenetic significance. He
