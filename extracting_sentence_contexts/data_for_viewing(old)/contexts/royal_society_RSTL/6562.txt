570 MR, A. CAYLEY ON TSCHIRNHAUSEN'S TRANSFORMATION.

where it may be remarked that the greater part, but not all, of the component coeffi
cients are divisible by 5. I soon observed in the process of summing the ten divisions
that all the resulting coefficients should be divisible by 5 (the only exception is as to
the terms in y* which contain B*, C*, Df, and F* respectively), and the circumstance that
they are 80 in each particular instance is as far as it goes a verification, which, however,
only applies to those of the component coefficients which are not themselyes divisible by
5. But it was known &@ priori (I will presently show how this is 80) that the sum of the
resulting coefficients should be equal to zero, and that they are 0 in fact is a verification
as to all the coefficients. - The foregoing specimen term BCDE is one which remains
unaltered when B, C, D, E are changed into E, D, C, B; and on making the further change
a,b,c,dq,e,fintof,e, d,c, b, a, the coefficient of BODE remains, as it should do, unaltered ;
this is a verification of the coefficients of the terms ace*, df; ad*e, bf, which are
respectively interchanged by the substitution in question, but not of the other terms
wf*, abef, acdf, b*@, bedf, which are respectively unaltered by the substitution. I did not
employ what would haye been another convenient verification of the several divisions,

viz. the comparison of their values on putting therein a=b=e=d=e=f=1, with the
corresponding values as calculated independently from the determinant
y4—B—4C—6D—E, — B—5C—10D—10E, — C— 5D—10E,
E, y— B—-4C— 6DP+ E, — B— 5C—10D ,
