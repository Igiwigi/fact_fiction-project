Position 2. 482
Position 3. 493

In changing therefore from position 1 to position 3, a deflection corresponding to
twenty-five divisions of the scale was produced. 244 PROFESSOR TYNDALL'S FURTHER RESEARCHES

Wishing to place myself beyond the possibility of illusion as regards the fact of
deflection, I repeated the experiment with snccessive batteries of two, three and four
cells. The following are the results :â€”
