to the outside of the phloem. The latter, when it is preserved, consists of narrow
elongated elements.

On the outer border of the phloem are traces of secretory organs, which may have
been either sacs or canals.

The sections occasionally show the roots in the act of branching (Plate 8, photograph
19, rt.). The branches are always rootlets of much smaller size than the parent root.
In the example illustrated, the xylem-elements of the rootlet abut directly on one of
the protoxylem-angles of the main root. Very short tracheides are often found
ensheathing the wood of the rootlet at this point. The phloem and pericyclic paren-
chyma of the rootlet are well preserved, but its endogenous origin is by no means
evident. This is no doubt due to the fact that the periderm which envelops both
root and rootlet was an internal one, so that the primary cortex of both is lost.

Rootlets much smaller than the main roots hitherto considered, are often met with

in transverse section; in favourable cases their structure leaves no doubt as to their
identity. An especially clear specimen, 1Â°5 X 1 millim. in diameter, is shown in
Plate 8, photograph 21. The periderm is here 10 to 12 cells thick, and agrees exactly
with that of the main roots; the phellogen is beautifully preserved. The triarch stele
has begun to form secondary wood, which has only reached a thickness of about three
