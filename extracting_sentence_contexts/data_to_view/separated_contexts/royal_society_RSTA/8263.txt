As an example, taking p = 3, ¢ = 5, so that m = 9, the series solution of (76) is of the

form

multiples of 1/Yo; Gam; Gamiy «++ OF 1/Yo? 3 Gam: Gameq - - - O£ 1/Y,5, and so on, so that
the solution of (76) is of the form

Since product terms occur in the equations determining the other sets of coefficients,
simple expressions for them cannot be obtained, but it can be shown that «,,..,. (n= 0,
1,2....) areall positive, co +... are all negative, 5, n. all positive, and so alternately,
and that they diminish progressively in value. The method of series suffices to calculate Y in terms of X, provided X is not too close
to unity, but in practice a difficulty arises, since dY/dX becomes infinite for X = 1,
