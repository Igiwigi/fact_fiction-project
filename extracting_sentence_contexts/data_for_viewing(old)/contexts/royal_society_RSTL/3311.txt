but here during a period which cannot be reckoned by thousands of years, but only
by those great revolutions of nature which are the effects of slow and scarcely sen-
sible changes, works smaller than those ancient ones dedicated to superstition, retain
each outline nearly as perfect as when first formed by the hand of nature.

These facts are interesting under another point of view, for they prove to us that
we may trust the plain inference of our experiences. Although we see#* the stone of
many ancient buildings decaying and crumbling away, yet we know that others, as
the obelisks of Egypt, have lasted more than three thousand years, with the hiero-
glyphics nearly perfect on them : now we cannot see any reason why their general
outline, even in points of detail, should not last a hundred times three thousand years.
Again, although we might expect the crest of a mountain range to be shattered, and
the bed of a torrent to be worn down more or less deeply, yet if we look at a convex
slope of soil clothed with turf, and drained on each side by rivulets, we can see no
reason, as long as the vegetation is persistent, why such a slope (with the exception
of any spot where a waterspout might burst, or a stroke of lightning fall) should not
last for as many thousand centuries as the obelisks of Egypt shall remain entire. Of
the justice of these inferences, conclusive evidence is afforded by the state in which
