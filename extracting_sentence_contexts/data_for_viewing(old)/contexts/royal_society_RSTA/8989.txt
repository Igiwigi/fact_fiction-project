with D(3) = 43242°02. The e-sounder requires 19563. The only line in the neigh-
bourhood is \ = 5105 by Ramsay, who says his measurement is very rough. If we
allow dd = 5A, the wave-number is 19583+20, and it may be the line sought for.
There seem also other D,, groups as in X. One instance is adduced in the next
paragraph.

I end the discussion of the RaEm spectrum by a consideration of the source
of the 5640 separation. In X we found the conditions satisfied by oun displace-
ments on the F (0) of 5A,—d,, and 2A,+64,. But here the values of the separations
themselves seem very indeterminate. The values as arranged on p. 431 would seem
to point to 5633, 5649 with 1, about 2800 and 2820. The limit of the particular
F series on which our whole discussion of RaEm is based is 29964'20. As a fact, how-
ever, this limit can only generate in the proper neighbourhood separations of 5646,
2806, and the displacements are 54,—64,, 2A,+23, The dependence on these

displacements so analogous to those in X is evidence that the links in question (5640,
1864) are of analogous type. We have already seen in X that these separations occur
as links, as well as direct displacements on sequences present in the wave-number,
Let us determine the F limit required to give a separation in the correct neighbourhood
