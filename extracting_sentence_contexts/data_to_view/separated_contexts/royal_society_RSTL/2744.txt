At the moment of what we call death, the seneorial functions cease, the
animal no longer feels or wills. Whether the nervous functions properly Â£0
called still continue, can only be determined by experiment. That the nerves
when stimulated are till capable of exciting the muscles of yoluntary motion
is a fact generally admitted ; and that they are still capable of exciting the
action of the muscles of involuntary motion, appears from many experiments
related in the second paper, which I had the honour to present to the Society,
and which was published in the Philosophical Transactions of 1815. That
the neryous system is capable of causing the evolution of caloric, which
supports animal temperature after the sensorial power is withdrawn, appears

and that the neryous power under the same circumstances is still capable of
forming the secreted fluids, and 8upporting the other processes. by which the
structure of eyery part is maintained, is shown by very frequently repeated
experiments. on. the newly dead animal related in the same- treatise.
