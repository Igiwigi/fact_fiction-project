the direction of rotation being given, we might point out
immediately the direction in which the-deviation would take
place. On comparing together all the facts which I have detailed,
I found that this might be effected in the following manner. I refer the deviations of the horizontal needle to the devia-
tions of magnetic particles in the direction of the dip, or to
those of a dipping needle passing through its centre ; s0 that,
in whatever direction this imaginary dipping needle would
deviate by the action of the iron, the horizontal needle would
deviate in such a manner as to be in the same vertical plane
with it : thus, when the north end of the horizontal needle
deviates towards the west, and consequently the south end
towards the east, I consider that it has obeyed the deviation
of the axis of the imaginary dipping needle, whose northern
extremity has deviated towards the west and its southern
towards the east; s0 that the western side of the equator of
this dipping needle has deviated towards the south pole of
the sphere, and its eastern side towards the north pole. It
would follow from this, that if the north and south sides of
the equator of the dipping needle (referring to these points
in the horizon) deviated towards the poles, no corresponding
deviation would be observed in the horizontal needle ; the
effect, in this case, taking place in the meridian, would only
be observable in the angle which the dipping needle made
with the horizon.
