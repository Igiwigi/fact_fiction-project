The nitrous gas with which the oil of vitriol is impreg-
nated ſhews no diſpoſition to quit the acid by expoſure to air ;,
but, on adding water to the impregnated acid, the gas/is ex- |
pelled ſuddenly with great efferveſcence, and with red fumes,
in conſequence of its mixture with the atmoſpherical air,

' Upon adding 240 grains of water to 60 grain-meaſures of
impregnated oil of vitriol, -2300 grains of nitrous gas were
thrown into the receiver ; but as the ation. of the two liquors.
is inſtantaneous, the quantity of gas expelled from. the retort
before its neck could be immerſed in water, and placed under
the receiver, muſt have been conſiderable. The whole of the
g38, however, was not extricated by. means of the water, for

the remaining liquor diſſolved 5 grains of copper, while co
meaſures of nitrous gas were thrown into the retort.
28. The following facts. principally are eſtabliſhed by the
preceding experiments.
1. That a mixture of the vitriolic and/ nitrous acids. in a
concentrated ſtate has a, peculiar. faculty of diſſolving filyer
copiouſly. S 2.
