probably the same as BouGarer'st erythrophyll. Gavurier'st crystalline body is,
according to HoPPs-SEYLER, a mixture of erythrophyll, chlorophyllan, and wax.

Still Hansex's method is useful becanse it enables one to see if the chlorophyll of
animals can be made to yield the same constituents as that of plants, and if the
s0lntions yield the same 8Þectra after saponifying.

Tt is unnecessary to repeat the account of the results I obtained, but I may say
that it appears that vegetable chlorophyll is considerably changed by saponification,
80 is Spongilla chlorophyll, and 80 is enterochlorophyll. A likeness in all the spectra
of the solutions of these chlorophylls is, however, apparent after saponifying, and the
ultimate constitnents crystallize in the same form, 80 far as I can judge from
HaxstNn's description. The mere fact that ib is most difficult to separate the
saponified constituents of animal chlorophyll from each other, while it is easy enough
in the case of vegetable chlorophyll, goes to show that the constitution of the
respective chlorophyll differs, and this fact, taken in connexion with the microscopic,
spectroscopic, and chemical evidence, seems to me to establish almost beyond doubt
that in the case of enterochlorophyll we are dealing with an animal product.

IT have not quoted nearly all the papers written on chlorophyll, as this would be a
great and unnecessary task. F The following table giving the wave-lengths of the
bands in s0lutions of enterochlorophyll, Spongitla chlorophyll, and plant chlorophyll,
shows at a glance the agreements and differences between them :-—
