1. Effect of Oxygen (Suboxide of Copper). Copper readily absorbs oxygen from the air when in a fused state; and it is 8upposed
to be present as suboxide, which it retains very obstinately; and in fact we may
lead hydrogen over fused copper, i a porcelain tube, for hours without completely
reducing the suboxide. It is also very difficult to prevent the oxygen being absorbed
during casting, &c. In order to prevent all these sources of error, we thought that in
making the alloys of copper by the following method, we might obviate them :—
