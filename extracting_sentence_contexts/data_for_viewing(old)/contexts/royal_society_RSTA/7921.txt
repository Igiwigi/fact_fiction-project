35 and 36, Plate 17, taken in parallel polarized light and by ordinary transmitted
light respectively, show a typical distribution : the shape of the spot is clearly due
to a spreading from two neighbouring centres. In the middle the crystallites have
apparently developed the normal cubical form, since they show black between crossed
Nicols. There are, then, several zones of spherulets* arranged in concentric circles,
succeeded, as we go out, by a zone of large well-formed crystals, optically isotropic.
Then comes the film which was originally purple, but is now densely packed with
spherulets.

Various stages of heated films are, therefore, represented in the mercury-infected
film. The only difference is the development of the well-formed crystals, which
are not flat and do not present a (111) face. The resolution was not great enough to
enable the outline to be carefully studied. The fact that the upper part of the
crystals was never in focus at the same time as the lower part pointed to considerable
thickness, and added to the difficulty of determining their habit and orientation.

Another way of investigating the effect of mercury contaminations is to heat the
film before these spontaneous changes have taken place. A silver film, showing
yellow spots, prepared in exactly the same circumstances as the one whose behaviour

* The optical figure is not clear in fig. 35, which is much reduced, but showed plainly in every
particle in the original, which was x 1000.
