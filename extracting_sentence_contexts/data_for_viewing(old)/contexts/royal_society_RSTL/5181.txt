me to do 80.

T can hardly find any notice of this little tract of Dr. Mary. Had it been much
known I cannot but suppose that the following phrase of Newrox would have obtained
some currency: the English parenthesis, and the italics, are Mary's, not mine.

There is also an interesting fact concerning Ds Motrvrs, which is little, if at all,
cited. Happening one day to have to call on the Earl of Devonshire, he met a man
whom he did not know coming out of the house. This man was Nezwron, who had
come to present a copy of the Principia, and had left it in the antechamber in which
De Morvss had to wait till the Earl was ready to see him. He opened the book,
and found to his surprise, that, strong as he knew himself to be, he could only just
manage to follow the reasoning. He immediately procured a copy ; but as he was
employed all day in walking about London from one pupil to another, the only way
in which he could read it was by tearing leaf after leaf, and carrying a few at a time
in his pocket to look at in his walks and in other intervals.

It cannot be necessary to remind the Society that the subject of this paper may
possibly not be the only case in which their records would furnish information on
