Remark 4.6. Since, as follows easily from theorem 4.1, we have 0 =c + iV, where V := (0 — c)/i
is an unbounded self-adjoint operator with spectrum o(V) given by o(V)=R (and with no
eigenvalues), one can equivalently define a by a :=c+iV™, where V := @(V) and
@ :R—R satisfies ce(@™(R)) =[-T, T]. In addition, when c 41, one requires that 0 is
continuous, while, when c=1, one assumes that @) admits a meromorphic extension to a
connected neighbourhood of R in C.

We can now introduce the following key definition. The spectral operator a is said to be quasi-
invertible if each of its truncations a‘) is invertible (for T > 0), in the usual sense (and, hence, if


for every T>0,0¢ o(a™), Using theorem 4.4 and the above expression for o(a), along with the
fact that an operator is invertible if its spectrum does not contain the origin, it is easy to check
that if a is invertible, then it is quasi-invertible. The converse, however, need not be true, as we
shall see in §5. (It turns out that assuming that for all c € (0, 3) the quasi-invertibility of a =a, is
equivalent to its invertibility, is equivalent to the RH; see theorem 5.4.)

The first result in this context is the exact operator theoretic analogue of theorem 3.3 (from §4c).

Theorem 4.7 (Riemann zeros and quasi-invertibility of a, [8,10]). Fix c¢ R. Then, the spectral
operator a= ac is quasi-invertible if and only if ¢ =¢(s) does not have any zeros on the vertical line
{Re(s) = c}.

It follows that, in the midfractal case when c = t 41/2 is not quasi-invertible (since ¢ has a zero
along the critical line {Re(s) = 3) and that for c > 0 (in order to avoid the trivial zeros of ¢, located
