very unlikely that, merely by such anastomosis, any nervous
influence could be conveyed.

I think it right to answer another possible objection which
may be made, viz. that nervous matter may be co-extended,
or co-existent with all other animal matter, and that, of
course, it is of no consequence whether there be any sen-
sorium, or reservoir of impressions, &c. or not ; because the
stimulus, which produces action, must reside in parts, as well
as the other substance of which they are composed.

Now, although this may possibly be true, we have no evi-
dence of the fact sufficiently satisfactory to carry conviction
along with it. On the contrary, there seems to be good
reason for entertaining an opinion, that nervous influence is
conveyed from the brain downwards. If we are right in this
conjecture, which is warranted by the experiment of tying,
or cutting nerves, then the existence of the nervous fibre,
like that of a string of a musical instrument, would be inactive,

unless it received an impression, which, with regard to the
nerves, should come from the brain.
