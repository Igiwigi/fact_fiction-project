'The difficulties to his reasoning, arising from his neglect of viscosity and friction-

hold between the solid crust and the liquid nucleus at the surfaces of contact, have been
forcibly stated by M. DELAUNAY (and have certainly been underrated generally, and,
indeed, have only been met by the mathematicians who have book the partisans 9s Mr.
Hopxixs's views), by showing that if the physical difficulty of such viscosity &c. be admitted,
other mathematical difficulties must arise if we cling to the method of Mr. HoPkins as
capable at all of giving any answer to the question of thickness of the earth's erust,
which the writer believes it is not. That that thickness is not small, however, the writer
believes to be the fact upon considerations wholly different from those of Mr. Hoekixs ;
and that view receives support from the investigation of Sir WILLIAM "THOMSON as to |
the rigidity of the carth, at least with those who admit the sufficiency of the physical
data upon which his mathematical reasoning there is founded. The effect, however, of
this conjunction of the reasonings of the physical astronomer and of the geologist has
been to raise a new difficulty for both.

16. The geologist, chaineddown under 800 miles or more of solid rock, the real thickness
of which he is in no condition to disprove, cannot get his liquid lava sea beneath to the
surface; and he has no other source for volcanic heat and ejecta to snggest.

The mathematician has the fact before him; volcanoes exist. He admits the difficulty
of the geologist, and meets it by the most lame and gratuitous hypothesis of lakes or
