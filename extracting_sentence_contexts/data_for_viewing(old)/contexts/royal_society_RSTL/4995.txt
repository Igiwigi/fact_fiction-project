consist simply of solid spherules, resulting from the solidification of albumen, Plate

The bulk of this fluid consists of salt water; for when the specimen dries and the
fluid evaporates, cubic crystals of chloride of sodium are seen amidst the albuminons
molecules. This fluid was first seen in motion by LisTes, then by Mitxs-Epwarvs,
and by Van Bexepex. It may be well here to observe, that the molluscan polypes of
the Flustre, Eschare and Bowerbankia, are ciliobrachiate, and that the digestive
organs are divided from the visceral cavity. In these genera, therefore, the fluid con-
tents of this cavity receive no direct admixture of salt water through the tentacles, for
the extremities of these organs are not perforate. It is replenished only through the
stomach ; the water is submitted to the agency of this organ before it enters into the
visceral chamber. This fact explains the circumstance, that in these molluscoid
polypes the fluid of the visceral cavity, as compared with that of the former group,
presents a higher organic composition ; its cells are corpusculated and evidently
organized; many bear globules of oleine, although comprising several individual
forms of cell; they are consfant in their microscopic characters in the same species.
The fluid is aGrated in the tentacles. It is true-blood in its composition and func-
tions, fig. 2.*.

Meduse,â€”In all Acalephe the digestive cavity is prolonged into a system of canals
into which the contents of the stomach pass by direct communication. The gastro-
vascular channels are to the Acaleph what the visceral cavity or the bollow interior
of the polypidom is to the Polype. In both cases the contained fluid consists of a
chylaqueous compound. In both, the containing chambers and canals are lined by
