Relative realism is a general philosophy that reality is like

pure mathematics, created by decisions to work within

certain axioms or assumptions [1-3]. To the extent that

we transcend that level of ‘reality’ but the fact that those
axioms were possible, together with all the substructure
they contain, is an element of a larger reality in which that
was just one path we could have taken. This makes reality
relative to your point of view, which is not necessarily
a bad thing given the Copenhagen interpretation of
quantum mechanics.

In this point of view, physical reality as we know
it should be characterized or in some sense created by
the decision to adopt certain axioms or assumptions.
The difference with most mathematical subjects is that
we do not a priori know what the axioms are but are
