This is why labels
such as ‘robo-ethics’ or ‘machine ethics’ miss the point, anachronistically stepping back to a time
when ‘computer ethics’ seemed to provide the right perspective. It is not the hardware that causes :
ethical problems, it is what the hardware does with the software and the data that represents the [=
source of our new difficulties. LoAp brings into focus the different moral dimensions of data. 23
In doing so, it highlights the fact that, before concerning information, ethical problems such
as privacy, anonymity, transparency, trust and responsibility concern data collection, curation, mea)
analysis and use, and hence they are better understood at that level. :

In the light of this change of LoA, data ethics can be defined as the branch of ethics a]
that studies and evaluates moral problems related to data (including generation, recording, DNS
curation, processing, dissemination, sharing and use), algorithms (including artificial intelligence, aon
artificial agents, machine learning and robots) and corresponding practices (including responsible De
innovation, programming, hacking and professional codes), in order to formulate and support .
morally good solutions (e.g. right conducts or right values). This means that the ethical challenges
posed by data science can be mapped within the conceptual space delineated by three axes of
research: the ethics of data, the ethics of algorithms and the ethics of practices. The ethics of data focuses on ethical problems posed by the collection and analysis of large
datasets and on issues ranging from the use of big data in biomedical research and social sciences
[9], to profiling, advertising [10] and data philanthropy [11,12] as well as open data [13].
