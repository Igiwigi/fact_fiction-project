They correspond with what has been described as the great anterior and pos-
terior longitudinal bands of fibres, and during the distended state of the yiscus have their
height s0 greatly reduced by lateral stretching as scarcely any longer to deserve the
name of ridges. They, however, have their homologues in bladders of a lower type, and
occasion a thickening of the wall of the bladder anteriorly and posteriorly which cannot
otherwise be easily accounted for. It is a curious fact, and not without interest as far
as the comparative anatomy of the bladder is concerned, that traces of the fourfold ar-
rangement alluded to above may not unfrequently be detected in the human bladder,
particularly at the apex and base. In one specimen which I dissected and preserved, it
is especially distinct (Plate IV. fig. 16, a0, k1; fig. 18, bp, mn). Although it is usual to speak of the fibres constituting the muscular coats of the
bladder as longitudinal and circular, it may be as well to state that, strictly speaking,
5 those terms are inapplicable, the s0-called longitudinal fibres for the most part curving
and diverging either in an antero-posterior or lateral direction, and the circular ones
representing the aggregate of terminal loops, or very oblique fibres crossing at very ob-
tuse angles.
