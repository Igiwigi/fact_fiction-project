BROOKS ON LUOIFER:

follows that MersCaNICKOFF studied gomething else, or that he was in error in
believing that he had traced his Nauplins directly to what CLaus has shown to be a
somewhat late stage in the deyelopment of Zuphausia. METSCHNICKOFP'S only reason
for believing that his Nanuplius is a young Fuphansia is its regemblance to CLaus's
larva, and as there is certainly an error here, we are not justified in giving unqualified
acceptance to his statement that it is an Fuphausia larva. It seems very probable,
indeed, that this is the case, but in the absence of the direct evidence which could only
be afforded by actually tracing it back to an Fuphausia egg, or forwards to the adult
Euphansia, T do not think that the existence of a Malacostracan Nanuplius can be 8aid
to be establisghed by these observations, for they do not stand the severe test which is
demanded by their unusual importance, and I think the facts justify the statement
that, up to the present time, there has been no unquestionable evidence of the
occurrence of 8uch a stage of development in the higher Orustacea,

The present series of observations is complete at both ends, and T have not relied
upon surface-collecting to fill a single gap, but have traced every stage in isolated
captive specimens, and the possibility of error s8eems to be entirely out of the
question. The close resemblance between the Nauplius of Incifer, and Mirizr's and
MerTscHNICKOFF's larva, renders it almost certain that they also are Malacostracan
laryz, but before this corroborative evidence was furnished, it was certainly quite
possible, although hardly reasonable, to doubt whether this was true of either of them. I.—Trz SEGMENTATION OF THE EGG, AND FORMATION OF THE F00D-YOLK AND
