However, six strains out of 13 (46%)
which grew on this DOM were isolated at 2 and 3m depth. Thus, it means that 69% of the strains
growing on F. cylindrus DOM were isolated in the ice or in the first metres of the water column. This is relevant to the fact that some interactions happen between the sea ice bottom and the
water column. The microalgae living in the ice excrete DOM will be used as a source of carbon by
bacteria in the first few metres of the water column. Moreover, these interactions are reinforced
as spring progresses with the beginning of the sea ice melt causing the release of a significant
amount of DOM into the water column, which will serve as a source of energy and carbon for
bacteria [33].
