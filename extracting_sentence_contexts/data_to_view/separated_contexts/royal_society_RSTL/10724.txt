When the drug is
locally applied its curve resembles greatly that produced by veratria (Plate 9, fig. 24, b). Tt appears to us to be an interesting fact that an inorganic element and an organic
alkaloid should have such a similar action. Their action coincides also in the modifica-
tions which it undergoes by heat and by potash. The barium contracture, like that
caused by veratria, is abolighed by cooling the muscle down, or by heating it con-
giderably above the normal.
