will depend on which selective force is stronger.

The example of altruism encourages the idea that equation
(3.2) is a quite general formalization of the ‘levels of selection’
question in evolutionary biology. In particular, one might
reasonably suppose that the debate over the importance of
‘group selection’ in nature can be interpreted as a debate
about whether, in actual biological populations, the term
Cov(W,, Z;) is substantial or not. This appears to be what
Price [4] and Hamilton [5] thought, and it is still a widely
held view today.

In fact, however, this interpretation of equation (3.2) is ques-
tionable. For it is quite possible that the term Cov(Wj, Z,) be
non-zero, even in the absence of what would ordinarily be
