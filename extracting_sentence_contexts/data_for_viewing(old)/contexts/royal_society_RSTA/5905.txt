For each ¢, we performed 104 pseudo-spectral simulations of the three-dimensional NSE
(2.12) at a spatial resolution of 128° starting from vp =0 at T=—1 until f=0. The final time
configurations were subsampled according to the estimated approximate correlation length
Aa.u, =0.8 of the observable, and the shaded area indicates a 95% Wilson score interval [42,43
for the PDF estimate based on the DNS data. For the lowest Re, the data are almost Gaussian,
and the instanton and PDF agree everywhere. No symmetry breaking is observed. For the two
higher Re, instead, the instanton approach only captures the tail scaling correctly, since common
strain events are not dominated by the instanton in this case. In the tails, though, the axisymmetric
instanton clearly underestimates the probability, while the symmetry-broken instanton is in good
agreement. This is particularly clear in the right tail of the right-most panel of figure 4, where
the axisymmetric instanton depicted by the red line is far too steep to agree anywhere with the
observed tail scaling. This trend continues in fully developed turbulence at higher Re: the analysis
of larger DNS, e.g. in [4], shows that the strain PDF tails can in fact be described by stretched
exponentials « exp{—c+ |a|°+} with exponents #4 < 1, whereas we find that the exponents in both
tails derived from the vortex-ring instanton increase monotonically with |a| and saturate above
04 =2.5 in the right tail and above #_ =2 in the left tail. By contrast, while the Sj(a)-curve that
we obtained for the symmetry-broken instantons is still convex in the observable range that we
were able to consider at the given resolution, the exponents + are monotonically decreasing in
|a| for this branch and decay below 1.5 for both positive and negative strain.

For the vorticity observable of the same DNS dataset at ¢ € {1,250, 1000}, we observe the same
qualitative results (not shown): at the lowest Re, the instanton again perfectly describes the PDF,
whereas the range of validity of the estimate transitions into the tails at higher Re. Here, however,
because the symmetry breaking occurs at relatively higher a and leads to a less dramatic difference
in scaling, it is hard to draw as clear a conclusion as in the strain case.
