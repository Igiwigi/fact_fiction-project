We have been able to identify the lines and bands less refrangible than the D lines
(which were photographed when using Lumiére B plates) only by direct comparison
with other spectra. We have no lines of reference on the Middlesbrough plates from
which to draw a curve. A series of spectra was photographed at Crewe in January,
1895, on a plate stained with cyamine, and this includes both solar and Bessemer
flame spectra. A curve of wave-lengths was drawn and the wave-lengths of the
unknown lines and bands in the Bessemer flame spectrum were determined from it.
By direct comparison of the Middlesbrough spectra with this plate, and by measure-
ments of the oxyhydrogen flame spectra of the metals or compounds of lithium,
manganese, and iron, we have identified the lines and bands in the Middlesbrough
spectra, They were recorded in the analytical table of the second spectrum of Plate
No. 26, and call for no special remark beyond the fact that the bands and lines are
due chiefly to manganese, but are modified by bands and lines of iron, and possibly
by the orange lithium line 6108.

The red lithium line 6708, and the red potassium lines 6938 and 6911, do not
appear on the photographs, but were seen by the eye observations,

The Spectrum of the “ Over-blow.”

During the earlier part of the “over-blow” the flame is very short and not very
