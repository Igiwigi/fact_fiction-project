25. The genital ducts and the ureters
open separately into a wide urino-genital sinus, which through a wide neck leads into
the large ventral urinary bladder ; on the other hand it stands in communication with
the cloaca by a large aperture. This aperture is surrounded by a partly transverse,
but chiefly longitudinal, horizontal fold, the right and left halves of which can by
approaching each other completely close the urino-genital sinus, and in fact do so firmly
in the living animal. The walls in the recessus recto-vesicalis project over the opening
of the sinus, as shown in figs. 10,11, 25, and 26.
