to consider syzygies in this context.


(f) Framed with resolutions

In the previous subsections, we identified all possible ways of proving the membership of f in I
arguing that the coordinates, in terms of our Grébner bases, of all the expressions (of the paths
in the graph) are the same modulo (x + y, -y). We mentioned that the module that made this
possible was the second syzygy module of a certain resolution. In this subsection, we will briefly
explain these ideas and concepts. For more details, we refer the reader to [4, Section 1.10] and to
[8]. Indeed, if we consider the first paragraph of [8], let M be a module, over a commutative ring
R, generated by fi,...,fn. A syzygy is an element {a1,...,4n} such that ayf1 + ---anfn =0. Now,
the set of all syzygies is a submodule of R", called a syzygy module. In fact, it is easy to see that
this submodule is the kernel of the map that sends the standard bases element e; of R" to fj. In
addition, one may repeat this process to obtain syzygy of syzygies. We now give a more formal
treatment of what is a syzygy module.

Let R be an abelian group and let M be an R-module. A resolution of M is an exact sequence of

R-modules:
