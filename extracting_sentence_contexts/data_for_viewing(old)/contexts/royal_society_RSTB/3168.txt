would seem to suggest that, in so far as this nucleolar constituent is concerned, the
mode of growth of the nucleolus in earlier stages is by passive deposition rather than
by osmotic diffusion.

VI. Significance of the Nucleolus in Antedon.

So little evidence has been forthcoming in the present investigation to show how the
nucleolus first arises, that we are deprived of whatever indication its mode of origin
might have provided as to the significance of this structure in the cell-metabolism.
There are, however, two points concerning the young nucleolus to which attention
may be directed. The first point concerns its position. In the resting oogonium the
nucleolus appears to be always peripheral in position, whereas in the actively growing
oocyte it is for some time invariably central, a fact which scarcely points to the peri-
pheral position of the nucleolus as denoting a cytoplasmic origin for this structure.*

* MontTGoMERY, 1898 (p. 523), after giving several instances of young nucleoli showing an invariably

peripheral position, concludes that “the nucleolar substance in many, if not in all, cases has an
extranuclear origin.” é
