the said “spines,” or how it came about that they are so remarkably varied in size,
colour, composition, whereas the rest of the septum, throughout the whole group of
Madreporaria, has a perfectly definite fibrous calcareous structure.

Similar Dark Bands of the Growth-lamelle.

In studying the “dark line” of the median plane of the septum, an important
consideration appeared to me to be the exact similarity in appearance presented by the
dark bands at the inner surface of each of the growth-lamelle composing the fibrous
portions of the septum (cf. below, figs. 30a and B). It was not difficult to recognize
the cause of the latter appearance. For each calicoblast which I had observed at the
superficial parts of the skeleton showed an unchanged cell-remnant at its proximal
skeletal end. This fact can be confirmed by the use of stains.

When, now, the small size of the individual calicoblasts is remembered, it will be
readily seen that adjacent proximal ends would give the appearance of a continuous
band. These bands, like the “ points” in the median plane, sometimes appear
brownish. The highest magnifying power never displays any structure in the case of
points or bands that appear dark, but only shows a general black amorphous sub-
stance, which I can only regard as the carbonized residue of the originally unchanged
organic parts of the calicoblasts. The ultimate appearance of these portions would
