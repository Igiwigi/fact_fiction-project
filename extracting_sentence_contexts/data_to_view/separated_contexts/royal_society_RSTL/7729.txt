F complete intersection with the surface is made up of the line X=0, Y=0 (the axis)
times, the line X=0, Z=0 (the edge) 4 times, and a skew cubic, the equations of

Which may be written

| X, YL, Wale=0:
| 4Z, X, —6Y | In fact from the equations U=0, H=0 we deduce H—=ZU=X*({X?—4YZ)=0; and if

in U=0 we write X?2=4YZ, it becomes Z(XW-+5Y?)=0; and then in 5U=0, writing
5Y?= — XW, we have

5WXZ+Z(—XW)+5X*Y=X(5XY+47W)=0.

168. I say that the spinode curve is made up of the edge X=0, Z=0 once, and of
the cubic curye; and therefore s'=1.
