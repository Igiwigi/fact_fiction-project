58 F. H. EDGEWORTH ON DEVELOPMENT OF

ventralis forms a continuous sheet. Its posterior part (Hyohyoideus) spreads upwards
in the opercular fold. Its anterior part (Interhyoideus) is attached laterally to the
Keratohyale. Its front edge just overlaps the posterior edge of the Intermandibularis—
by eight 5-y sections = 0-04 mm.

In a 9-3-mm. embryo the conditions are similar but for the fact that the overlap of
the Interhyoideus part of the Constrictor hyoideus ventralis and the Intermandibularis
is greater. It amounts to 23 sections = 0-115 mm.

In a 75-mm. embryo the Interhyoideus and Hyohyoideus have become separated.
The overlap of the Intermandibularis by the former is 1-6 mm.
