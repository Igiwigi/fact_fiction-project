affairs might be, that the adductor influence constantly exerted on the vocal cords
is so great that it cannot be overcome by the abductor impulse originated in the
cerebral cortex on electrical excitation. The former of these explanations appears the
more probable, however, when compared to the condition met with in connection with
the cortical representation of eye movements, for in that case there could be no ques-
tion that the representation of the lateral movements of the eyes was so powerful,
that it was impossible to evoke the simple upward and downward movements of the
globes until it had been made impossible for these lateral movements to take place
by division of the lateral recti responsible for their production.

That the focus that has thus been eliminated in the anterior composite and prorean.
gyri is probably the true abductor cortical centre for the vocal cords, is made more
likely by the fact that it is precisely in the same region in the catâ€™s brain that
this effect is to be obtained. The only difference being that in the cat abduction
of the cords can always be evoked on cortical excitation whether the adductor
fibres in the recurrent laryngeal nerves be intact or not, whereas in the dog it is
sometimes necessary to divide the adductor fibres in one recurrent nerve before it is
possible to elicit abduction on exciting the cortex. This would appear to signify that
in the cat the cortical centres for abduction and adduction are more equally balanced,
and that there is not the preponderance of the adductor centre over the abductor as
in the case of the dog ; in fact there is rather a preponderance of the abductor over
the adductor.

The relative position which I have ascribed to the abductor centre, as compared
with the adductor, is in accord with the results which Horsiry and Semon obtained
