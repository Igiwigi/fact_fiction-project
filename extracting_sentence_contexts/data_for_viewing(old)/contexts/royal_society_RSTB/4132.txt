It being, then, assumed that not only, on the whole, do age and commonness go
together, but also age and wide distribution, we may now proceed to follow out the
probable course of development of the different systematic groups. According to
the hypothesis proposed in my former paper, taken together with the interesting
facts which have been set out in the present contribution, a species probably starts
on a small area as one or more individuals, and from that area spreads by aid of its
dispersal mechanism. Under the influence of natural selection, modified very much
at first (¢.e. in the earlier stages) by chance, but less in proportion later, the species
will spread, gradually occupying a larger and larger area of the earth’s surface, so
long as there remain places suited to it within reach. Sooner or later, in perhaps a
large proportion of the cases, it will give rise somewhere or another to another species,
which again will commence as a single one or as a few individuals in a definite spot.
If this spot were always near the centre from which the original species started, we
should on the average, after some time, get a series of concentric circles, representing
the various species developed, the largest circle representing the oldest species. But
in actual fact we know that new species may develop, as they must have developed
in Ceylon, near to the margin of the area occupied by the parent species. Further,
