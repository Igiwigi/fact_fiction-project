This happens provided that t > ty = u9/(BgTo). For t > ty, the acceleration on
the left-hand side of the Navier-Stokes equations now balances the buoyancy term: uy /t ~~ u2 /L~
BgTo(L/Lo)~> originating the following new scaling laws [8]:

Let us now move to analyse the two-point statistics and assume that the bulk quantities, we
have identified serve as large-scale properties of the flow, below which a cascade process may
originate according to a generalized Kolmogorov—Obukhov picture. The idea is that, despite the
fact that the problem at hand is not stationary, and thus very far from the classical playground of
the Kolmogorov theory, small-scale turbulent fluctuations can rapidly relax to the slower large-
scale dynamics. This is the essence of the adiabaticity hypothesis leading to a generalization of
the classical Kolmogorov theory for a turbulent puff. We refer to [8] for the phenomenological
theory when the buoyancy is negligible.
