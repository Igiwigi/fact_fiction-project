It would appear, therefore, that from two molecules of the organo-metal, one equi-
valent of ethyl only is displaced by the negative chlorine, or the compound group 50,
Hitherto my attempts to produce a lead base richer in ethyl have failed. Experiment
Shows that if chlorine be passed over the sesquiethylated chloride, the decomposition
proceeds beyond the removal of the additional equivalent of ethyl; in fact the salt
enters into combustion and is entirely destroyed. The aqueous solution of the chloride
appears also to be unaffected by a stream of chlorine gas. Chloride of lead is not throwh
down.

Oxide of Diplumbic Triethyl.

"The alkalies do not immediately form precipitates in the aqueous solutions of the salts
of this base ; but when the solid chloride is gently heated with strong potash, an oily
body sinks without liberation of oxide of lead. The same body may be obtained more
conveniently through the agency of oxide of silyer. 'The oil which forms on cooling ®
erystalline mass, is oxide of diplumbic triethyl. It readily volatilizes in white pungent
fumes, which provoke sneezing. It strongly blues litmus paper, and attracts carbonie
