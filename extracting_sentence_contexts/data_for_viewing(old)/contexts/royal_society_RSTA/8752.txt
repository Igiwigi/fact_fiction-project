¢ (2) 3 = m( x a, cubes ea =} — z » Curl A,].

The first and third of these equations show that ¢ and A, are the usual scalar and
vector potentials ; in fact from the third we have

Curl A, = grad @,+ . ed
=i

so that A, is the vector potential and then ¢, is the scalar potential.

The fourth equation thus determines the usual expression for the reaction forces on
the moving electron ; the fifth equation determines similarly the force on the moving
magnetic pole in the form

m( grad p+ : oh, )—" = Lm Curl A,] = m(B-4 = [Ym Curl A, al):
