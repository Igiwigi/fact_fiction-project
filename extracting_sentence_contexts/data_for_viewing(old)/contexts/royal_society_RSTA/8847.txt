Tf we take for the limit of resolution a ratio 5/6, 7.e. a drop of 16 per cent. at the
centre, this corresponds to the condition g=2n,. Hence the least difference of fre-
quency resolvable is twice the frequency of the galvanometer. For the experiments
this limit is 3/sec., but practically a rather higher degree of resolution was obtained.
Undoubtedly this is due to the fact that the above ratio is that of the maximum ampli-
tudes obtained by taking the two vibrations always in the same phase. If they are
taken in opposite phases the two peaks are completely separated, as indicated by the
dotted curve in fig. 16. The motion of the galvanometer is in general compounded of

excursion is the easiest observed. Midway between, the two components become equal
in amplitude and frequency, giving rise to pronounced beating. The beats have a
