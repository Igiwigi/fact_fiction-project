Figure 1. Schematic of a particle plume developing during a deep sea mining process, as particles are released from a surface
ship into the ocean. The depth of the intrusion of the water within the particle plume is key for assessing the fate of any minerals
dissolved into the water, while the controls on the migration of the particles through the water column are key for assessing the
area over which the particles may be dispersed.

buoyant relative to the surrounding air [8,9]. The majority of the fine-grained fraction of the
erupted material then rises as a buoyant plume until it reaches its neutral buoyancy height
[8,9], while some of the larger particles may settle from the plume once their fall speed becomes
comparable to that of the ascending plume. In highly explosive eruptions, the majority of the
material is in fact very fine grained [9], and so has a small fall speed relative to the speed
of the plume. Hence, this material rises with the plume to the neutral height [10], and we
explore this limit in the present work, assuming all particles are carried upwards with the
plume. However, as the mixture begins to spread laterally at this neutral height, the particles
gradually separate from the ash-laden air, falling back through the environment towards the
ground [11-14].

In nature, it is difficult to observe all the processes in detail during an intense explosive
eruption. However, observation of the neutral or umbrella clouds at a number of eruptions
suggest that the laterally spreading neutral cloud is somewhat asymmetric relative to a horizontal
plane; there is an upward drift of the cloud as it spreads out, as may be seen in the images
from the eruption at Mt Shiveluch (2007) and Mt Redoubt (1991) [15], and consistent with the
satellite image of the neutral cloud at the eruption of Raikoke (2019) (figure 2). Improving our
