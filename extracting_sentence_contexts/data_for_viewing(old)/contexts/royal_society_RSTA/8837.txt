the application to the dissociation constant of a factor dependent upon the progressive
change which takes place in the free water as dilution proceeds.

The foregoing treatment of the matter in the consideration of the specific heats and
specific volumes of aqueous solutions appears to throw further light on the problem.

Following up the hint given by a consideration of viscosities the present investigation
shows that good results can in fact be attained by treating the changes in both the
specific heat and the specific volume of the free water as being simply proportional to
the percentage of the solute present, 7.e.,

Sw—Sy = Px constant,

w—wy = Px constant.

P is proportional to 1/(E+H). The constants were also calculated on the
hypothesis that the changes were proportional to 1/H instead of P. The results were
not very different but not quite so concordant, and the hypothesis that certain
changes in the free water of a solution which depend on diminution of molecular
complexity are simply proportional to the percentage concentration of the solute
