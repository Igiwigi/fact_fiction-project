indicating a sudden increase of pressure was the first and direct result of the
explosion, and that the succeeding fall of the barometer . . . required some

The Sea Waves.

We have already detailed the observations regarding sea waves occasioned by the
great eruption of St. Vincent on May 7th in Barbados, Bequia, St. Lucia, Martinique,
and Guadeloupe. (See p. 406 and p. 410.) In Barbados and in Bequia its amplitude
was 24 feet, in Martinique about 1 foot. Assuming that it originated in St. Vincent,
