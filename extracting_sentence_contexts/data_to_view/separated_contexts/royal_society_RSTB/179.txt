In this operation most of
the external motor areas were removed, including the anterior slope of the ascending
parietal, the whole of the ascending frontal as far as the lower end of the fissure of
Rotanvo, the posterior third of the superior frontal gyrus, and the part of the middle
frontal gyrus included in the angle of the prefrontal suleus. All this part of the brain
was perfectly healthy when exposed for removal. Result.â€”There is paralysis with contracture of both right limbs, but the hemiplegia
and prostration are not so complete as in the cases previously recorded, which is no
doubt due to the fact that the lesion was not quite so extensive. There is some
slight ability to grasp with the fingers of the right hand, but none with the toes of
the corresponding foot. There is distinct contracture at right elbow, hip, and knee ;
when actively climbing, the right arm and hand are occasionally employed, but not the
corresponding leg.
