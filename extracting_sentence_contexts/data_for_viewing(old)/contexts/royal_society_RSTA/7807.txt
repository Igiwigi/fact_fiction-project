the solution for the load along the axis of symmetry. Incidentally, the torsion problem
for this cross-section is needed and a previous solution for the equivalent hydrodynamical
problem, due to Basset (1884, p. 245), is also shown to be incorrect. Further, on tracing

the total twisting effect of the load upon the circular cross-sections, the writer disagrees
with Young, Elderton and Pearson’s interpretation of some of their results, in particular
disliking their introduction of a so-called “total torsion’’, which is in fact not a pure
torsion at all, and, further, has no meaning apart from uni-axial cross-sections.

In recent years further solutions for cross-sections of uni-axial symmetry have been
published, one or two while this paper was in course of preparation, Shepherd
(1932) has obtained the solution for a circular cross-section with a radial slit of any
depth, and later (Shepherd 1936) the solution for the cardioid cross-section. In this
latter paper he corrects an error of sign for the associated torsion in his earlier paper,
but here also the writer finds some misinterpretation of otherwise correct results. It
is worth mentioning that among Young, Elderton and Pearson’s many results will
be found the solution for the complete circular cross-section with a radial slit from
centre to circumference, which links up with Shepherd’s result.
