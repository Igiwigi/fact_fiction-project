If there is in general no morphological boundary between the bundles and the
fundamental tissue, it is apparently quite useless to discuss the fibro-vascular system
of the higher plants from the morphological standpoint. Further, if in accordance

x with Mr. Booptr’s views we regard the very complex arrangement of bundles in the

S adult stem of Pteris aquilina as included in a single circular central cylinder, it is not

% easy to see why a similar view should not be taken of the equally complex arrange-

& ment of bundles in the petiole.

& The simplest view, and that most in harmony with all the facts, seems to be that

a the medullated monostelic central cylinder, so strikingly characteristic of the more
