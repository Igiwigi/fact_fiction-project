may be the case with other tissues.
ut though some of the facts above mentioned furnish clear evidence that ordinary solid

In are necessarily merely neutral in their conduct towards the blood in this matter. Tt is
quite possible that they may: exert an active influence upon it, in consequence of which
the particles of fibrine may experience a mutual repulsion, in the same way as would
