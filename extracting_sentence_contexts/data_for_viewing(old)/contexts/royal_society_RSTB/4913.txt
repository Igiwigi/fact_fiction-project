The actual relationship of the shell to the segments of the Ostracod body is not at all
clear, Some authors, eg., GiesBREcHT (1913, p. 227), maintain that the carapace of
Crustacea has no value in phylogenetic comparisons. CatMAN, however (1919, p. 363),
considers that it was present in the ancestral stock of the Crustacea, in which case the
Ostracod shell must be considered as homologous with that of the Conchostraca. In the
latter group there is evidence (CANNon, 1924, p. 408) that it is formed entirely as a paired
outgrowth from the maxillulary segment. But, if this is so, it is difficult, assuming

the homology of the Ostracod and Conchostracan shell, to explain the fact that, while
the newly hatched larva of the Ostracod shows only the three typical pairs of naupliar
appendages and exhibits no trace of maxillule, it yet possesses a fully formed bivalve
shell. However, the adductor muscle of this earliest stage is not the adult adductor
muscle, but is a portion of the mandibular transverse muscle, separated laterally from
the rest but attached to the same median tendinous plate. The adult adductor muscle
appears first with the maxillule in the second larval stage. The small anterior mandi-
bular adductor muscle persists throughout life separated from the larger maxillulary
adductor muscle by the dorso-ventral muscles of the maxillule.

The fact that in the so-called nauplius the adductor muscle belongs to the mandibular
segment does not necessarily indicate that the shell-fold must also be derived from that
seyment. It is equally probable that the precocious appearance of the shell is a larval
