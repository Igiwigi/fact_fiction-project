Subtracting this amount from the ordinate of the diagram corresponding to 10
atmospheres, the remainder, of length 16°17 divisions, gives the corrected value of the
absolute strain, and is equivalent to 10°67 ten-thousandths of the whole volume, per
stress of 10 atmospheres, or to 0001067 per atmosphere, a result which is about
15 per cent. higher than that of Mr. Skiyner. From the nature of my observations
on this point, I do not think that much importance is to be attached to this discrep-
ancy, which represents a possible error of 2 millims. to be divided between the
measure of the length of the bubble on the release from 10 atmospheres tension, and
the measure of the recession of the mercury in the experiments just quoted.
