Brown hares typically have 3 (up to 5) litters per
year with an average litter size of 2-3 young [112]. In
Europe, the breeding season lasts from January to October
and litter size peaks in summer (approx. 2.5 young per litter),
while only 1-2 young per litter are born early in the season
(Jan-Mar; [113]). This lower litter size at breeding onset has
been attributed to the fact that young born early in the
season are costly. They are exposed to low ambient tempera-
tures, entirely lack burrows or nests, and hence have high
energetic costs of thermoregulation [113]. Although hares are
