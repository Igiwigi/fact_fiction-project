front of the head-process. The lateral mesodermal bands and the chorda-process
appear to be fused with the endoderm.

The available evidence seems to indicate that the head-process in Man very early
becomes intercalated in, or fused with, the endoderm. The prochordal plate, in the

earliest: stage (Bi24) in which it was identified with certainty, is situated immediately
in front of, and in contact with, the head-process. Whilst these facts seem to be
quite certain, the developmental changes which are effected in the next following
stages are not so easily interpretable. For instance, how are we to interpret the
apparent semicircular form of the thickened endoderm area in the Manchester,
Thompson-Brash and Dobbin embryos, whilst in the earlier stages (Bi24) and in the
later stages (embryo Rossenbeck) the thickened endoderm area is situated directly
in front of the head-process and is relatively smaller. Then, again, how are we to
interpret the occurrence of lateral mesodermal bands in the intermediate region ?
Finally, what is the significance of the apparent mesoderm producing cell-layer which
underlies the intermediate region of the head-process and which is so well marked in
the. Loris 49 embryo ?

The possibilities are as follows :â€”
