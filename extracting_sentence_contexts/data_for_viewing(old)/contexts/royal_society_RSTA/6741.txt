the evaporation, there must also be an influx of fresh water over the whole area of the
sea. The fresher water is continually mixed with the salter water and the mean result
is the regime corresponding to figure 2. Owing to this mixing the direction of the
mean current of salter water from the south will cut the lines of equal salinity so as
to pass from regions of higher salinity to regions of lower salinity, but the angle between
the two may be very small.

It is noteworthy that the mean salinity at the Stranraer-Larne Station is higher
than that at any point of the North Channel shown in figure 2. This must also be an
effect of mixing, as past this Station the mean current must flow away from the
trish Sea, i.e. in the direction of increasing salinity. In this instance the water from
the Irish Sea is mixed with the salter water from the Atlantic to the north of Ireland.
The fact that the salinity at Stranraer-Larne is under other influence than that coming
from the Irish Sea is shown by the correlation coefficients of table 4. There is only
small correlation with Chicken Rock and Holyhead-Dublin, and no significant correla-
tion with Fishguard-Rosslare.

At the four stations between the Mull of Galloway and Skulmartin L.V. the mean
salinities increase steadily towards the west, though the differences are small and the
Skulmartin series is very short. This fact, coupled with the higher salinity at Stranraer-
Larne, may indicate a south-going current of relatively salt water near the shore off
