AMBULACRUM IN THE ECHINOIDEA HOLECTYPOIDA. 401

regressive in ambulacral structure, the dyads persist, and the odd simple plates are
growing obsolete. Jackson (1912, p. 117) records as regressive variants two specimens
of Echinus afjinis, in which the apicad portions of the ambulacra are built of dyads.

For Echinoids generally, both Regular and Irregular types, triads are the pre-
dominant kinds of compound plates. In the Irregular forms, save for obviously
secondary developments in the petals of some genera, a triad character may be said
to be universal, although true combination is never found. A deduction from this
fact would suggest that the Exocyclic Echinoidea were not differentiated from
their Endocyclic ancestors before the latter had attained the “ triad-stage” of
ambulacral specialisation.

Tetrapygus niger (Plate 63, fig. 1) shows clearly the gradual production of tetrads
from an arrangement of alternate triads and simple plates. It seems reasonable to
postulate that more elaborate compound plates are similarly developed by the accretion
of previously independent plates to already compound nuclei. The teratological
specimen of Echinus esculentus described below (Section 2 (d), Plate 63, figs. 8, 11,
and 18) is particularly interesting in this connection. Where supernumerary plates
appear between the compounds they fail to become united with their neighbours, and
are apparently gradually resorbed (figs. 8 and 11). Where such a plate has been
developed within a compound it becomes incorporated into it by true combination,
