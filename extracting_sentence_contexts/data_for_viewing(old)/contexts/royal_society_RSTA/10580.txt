If our hypotheses give a fair account of the facts the numbers in this third column
will be proportional to /\@. Assuming for ¢ the uniform value ¢=2, we can
calculate the actual values of \,, and these are given in the fourth column.

§ 28. Knowing nothing about the variation in \y, we shall be content as a
preliminary hypothesis to suppose it to have the same value for each planet.
Combining this with the hypotheses already formulated, we notice that nf hod ought to
have the same value for each planet, as therefore ought also the function
mass/(radius)*, which is tabulated in column (3).

It will be seen at once that there is a certain amount of uniformity about the
numbers in this column, but it requires some consideration to determine how much
significance is to be attached to this uniformity.
