But the maximum and minimum values in dif-
ferent parts of the year are of unequal magnitude and at unequal intervals. This may
be reconciled with an expression of the form m 8in 2 (0—p) +n 8in (0 — »); and we
might determine m, n, /, , 80 as to make the expression agree nearly with the result
of observation. In fact, however, this would not be worth while, except we had the
empirical law confirmed by the results of observations at other places; for the greatest
values of this correction are — 4” and + 3», We here exclude the effects of the
equation of time. It is not difficult to see why the solar correction assumes such a form as this. It
includes the corrections due both to the sun's declination and his parallax.
