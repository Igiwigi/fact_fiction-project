suggest that the barrenness is due to a premature but partial ripening of the
Graatian follicles succeeded by an unusual amount of follicular atresia.*

The general practical conclusion to be drawn from the above considerations is that
it is better to keep the ewes in fair thriving condition, as continuously as possible,
than to submit them to an unnatural process of stimulation by “flushing” shortly
before and during the sexual season, while maintaining them on mere sustenance diet
at other times of the year,

There is another point of some practical importance which deserves notice. It is
sometimes asserted by breeders that the fertility of sheep is atiected by the ram
employed (.g., that the production of twins or triplets in place of single lambs is in
some way due to the use of particular rams). In the light of the facts stated above
regarding the production of ova, and remembering the far greater reproductive capacity
of the ram as compared with the ewe, these assertions (excepting where they can be
shown to apply to the causes of abortion) may be disregarded ; and asa practical matter,
the question of fertility (at least ordinarily) may be considered as one affecting the
ewe alone. At the same time, it is obvious that to ensure copulation occurring with
every ewe, the proportion of ewes to rams must not be too high, while there is
evidence that the sexual activity of the ram is liable to vary, both individually and
according to the breed.

The Border Leicester and Scotch Black-faced rams afford an example of this
variation. It is a common practice in Scotland with breeders of crosses between these
two varieties of sheep to keep Black-faced rams to serye those Black-faced ewes which
