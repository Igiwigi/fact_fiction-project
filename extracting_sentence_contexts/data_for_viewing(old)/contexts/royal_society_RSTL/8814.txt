nearly stationary at about the same temperature ; while closer to the land and at less
depths it falls nearer to the freezing-point of sea-water (se note, posfec, p. 635).

The temperatures at depths in inland seas were found at an early period to be very
different to those of open seas; and it is singular that the yery first observations made

in the Mediterranean by SaussURE in 1780, of 55*8 F. at 944 feet, and 55*5 at
1918 feet, remain substantially correct to the present day. It was, however, D'Urvuuis's
more extended observations in 1826 that made better known the fact that the tempe-
rature decreased from the surface down to 200 brasses (1066 feet), below which it
remained constant at about 13? C., or between 54 and 95* F. Still his greatest depth
did not exceed 3189 feet; but BirarD in 1831 extended the observations to a depth of
6377 feet, and till found the same degree of temperature.

Amt further showed, from a series of soundings made during 1840-44 in the western
basin of the Mediterranean, between Marseilles and Algiers, that the diurnal variation
of temperature ceases to be sensible at 16 to 18 metres, and the annual variation at
300 to 400 metres. The mean of his series of observations gave the following results:â€”
