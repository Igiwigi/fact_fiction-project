From this it appears that we are not yet in a position to calculate more than the
order of magnitude of the constant $(a/e)’ which the electronic theories give as the
value of k/«t.

Tn order to see how far the theoretical result agrees in other respects with the
observed facts, the values of k/«t at various temperatures for the metals and alloys
tested have been calculated from the values of the thermal and electric conductivities
given in the tables on pp. 426 and 437. The results are shown in the following table
and in the curves on Plate 31. ;

The corresponding values calculated from JAGER and DresseLHorst’s experiments
at 18° C. and 100° C. are also given for comparison.
