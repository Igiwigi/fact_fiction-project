mental’ arrangement along the floor of the sinus.

The water-vascular cavity, in so far as it concerns the arm of the starfish, consists of a
radial water vessel (w.v.r.), ‘segmental’ lateral canals (not shown in figure 11 but see
figure 2, w.v./.) and the cavities of the ampulla (figure 11, cav.amp.) and of the tube feet

cav.t.f.). The walls separating the water-vascular and perihaemal cavities are of connective
issue with inner and outer epithelial linings. On the right of the figure an ampulla is
hown intact, and it is apparent that connexion could be made between the two sinuses
yy perforation of the floor of the lateral sinus (perthaem.coel.lat.). It is, in fact, by this means
hat the axon fibres of the motor neurones leave the perihaemal system and enter the
onfluent cavities of the tube foot and ampulla (figures 11, 12, X).

2) The motor neurones of the perihaemal sinus

In order to study the neurones of the perihaemal sinus, the radial nerve cord has been
carefully dissected away from the underlying structures of the arm, cut into pieces of
‘@nvenient length (4-1 in.) and immersed in a 1 % solution of rongalitweiss-reduced
methylene blue in sea water. Examination under a one-sixth or one-twelfth objective.
