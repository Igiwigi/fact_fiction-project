we set divif := —B.

3. The classical Ornstein—Uhlenbeck semigroup

Here X is a separable Banach space endowed with a centred Gaussian measure y. The proofs of
the statements of this section may be found in the book [6], unless otherwise specified.
The O-U semigroup is defined through the Mehler formula by

TOf=f, T(bf(x):= [fet +V¥1—e-%y)y(dy), £>0, f €C,(X). (3.1)

It is a contraction semigroup on C;(X), and y is its unique invariant measure. It is not strongly
continuous, not even on BUC(X). In fact, it is easily seen that for every f €¢ BUC(X) we have
limy.o+ II Tf —filloo =0 if and only if limy-.o+ |[f(e~-) — floc = 0. However, for every f € C;(X),
the function (t,x) +> T(£)f(x) is continuous on [0,00) x X by the dominated convergence theorem,
and this allows to define the generator L as in §2c. Moreover, T(t) is strongly continuous in the
mixed topology, see refs [8,9].

Coming back to the norm topology, T(t) is not analytic and even not continuous in norm on
(0, 00), since ||T(t) — T(s)|l 4(c,(x) = 2 for ts, as a consequence of [10, Prop. 2.4]. The semigroup


T(t) is smoothing along the Cameron—Martin space H. More precisely, for every f € Cp(X) and
t> 0, T(t)f is H-differentiable at every x € X, and we have
