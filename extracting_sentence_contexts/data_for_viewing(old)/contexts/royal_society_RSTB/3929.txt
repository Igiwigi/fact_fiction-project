436 DR. E. A. NEWELL ARBER ON THE FOSSIL FLORAS OF THE WYRE FOREST.

though local subsidence took place in three: distinct areas, over which either
estuarine or lacustrine conditions now prevailed. These three areas were the
northern part of Coalbrookdale, the Highley, Shatterford and Dowles Brook Regions
of the Wyre Forest, and the Titterstone Clee Hills, with possibly other small
outliers. In my opinion there is no evidence to show that these areas were
ever connected with one another. To assume this conclusion necessitates a theory
of subsequent excessive denudation to account for the facts. On the other hand,
not only is this assumption unnecessary, but there is, so far as I am aware, no
evidence that the denudation of the Welsh Borderland has ever exceeded in amount
the normal denudation exhibited by all our British coalfields, which have not
been covered up, since early Mesozoic times, with a blanket of newer deposits.
Denudation of an ordinary or normal amount is not denied. I refer here simply
to the theory of excessive or extraordinary denudation, which has more than once
been postulated in respect to these coalfields.*

The measures deposited in these three essentially local hollows of the old
Palaozoie floor were diverse, because different conditions prevailed in different parts
of the area.
