The first example, SBS 0957 + 561 A/B, was verified
spectroscopically by Walsh et al. (1979) to represent two images of the same
distant (redshift z= 1.413) quasar. The lensing galaxy has a redshift z= 0.355
(figure 2a). The third limiting factor in locating lensed images arises from the fact that
surface brightness is conserved in the lensing process (as it is in conventional
optics). Howev brightness dims with increased redshift z as (1+ z)4
due to relativistic effects associated with the expansion of the Universe, many
lensed images viewed through galaxy clusters were simply too faint to be detected
and lay undiscovered until the 1980s when charge-coupled devices became
common on large ground-based telescopes. The increased sensitivity led to the
discovery in the mid-1980s of giant arcs such as that viewed in the cluster Abell
370 (z= 0.37, figure 2b).
