In assuming the solid state of 8ul-
phate of baryta, they became virtually non-conductors to electricity of 80 low
a tension as that of the voltaic battery, and the power of the latter over them
was almost infinitely diminished. 552. The theory I have adyanced accords in a most satisfactory manner
with the fact of an element or substance finding its place of rest, or rather of
evolution, sometimes at one pole and sometimes at the other. Sulphur illus-
trates this effect very well. When sulphuric acid is decomposed by the pile,
slphur is evolved at the negative pole; but when sulphuret of silver is decom-
posed in a similar way (436.), then the sulphur appears at the positive pole ; and
if a hot platina pole be nsed 80 as to vaporize the sulphur evolved in the latter
ease, then the relation of that pole to the sulphur is exactly the same as the rela-
tion of the swme pole to oxygen upon its immersion in water.
