A suffered compression, According to the terminology used in this paper, both
responses are positive ; the first being in the same direction as the exciting current,
cannot be polarisation, but is obviously blaze effect; the second being opposed in
direction to the exciting current, is in the polarisation current, and is therefore of
debateable nature,

Type IV. is that presented by an absolutely dead eyeball. The after-currents are
counter-currents in relation to excitatory currents, of much smaller electromotive
value and of much shorter duration than blaze currents. They are ordinary polarisa-
