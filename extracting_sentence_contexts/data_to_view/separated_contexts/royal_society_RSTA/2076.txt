If everything is emergent,
then processes without dissipation are exceptional. Then energy does not leak towards the ever
existing microlevel, it is somehow insulated. The fact that the two interpretations are practically
the same is a disturbing consequence. It may be reasonable to postpone the decision until more
is known about the performance of this possible unification, e.g. until electrodynamics is derived
from nonequilibrium thermodynamics. If everything were to be dissipative, non-dissipative evolution arises as a particular limit.
