Assuming that citrinin titrates as a monobasic acid, its molecular weight is thus 249-9,
B or if it is a dibasic acid, 499-8. The molecular weight of C,,H,,O; is 250 so that it
$ appears probable that citrinin has the formula (C,,H,,0; with a molecular weight of
& 250 and titrates to phenolphthalein as a monobasic acid.

Molecular weight of citrinin.

In a determination of the molecular weight by Rast’s method, 0-00354 gm. citrinin
caused a depression of 9-89° C. in the melting point of 0-03994 gm.- camphor. This
corresponds to a molecular weight of 356. It was noted, however, that distinct signs
of some decomposition or interaction between the citrinin and camphor were visible
during the experiment, a fact which would render the above estimation invalid.

Optical activity of citrinin.

Citrinin is levorotatory in alcoholic solution. 0-4996 gm. of citrinin was dissolved
in 100 c.c. of absolute alcohol and polarised in the mercury green light in a 20 cm. tube.
The mean of a number of rotations was — 0-4167° corresponding to [4 ie, gon =
— 41-7.

0+ 2543 gm, dissolved in 25-08 c.c. absolute alcohol gave an average rotation of —0-+891°
in a 20 em. tube with the mercury green light. This corresponds to a specific rotation
Of []its. green = — 43°9°,
