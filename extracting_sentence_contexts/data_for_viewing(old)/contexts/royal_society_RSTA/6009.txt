Te (classical fluctuations) is of order exp(—N/T-) and the annealing time cannot be bounded by
any polynomial in N.

Following the initial study [5] of phase transition of transverse (quantum) Ising spin glasses,
the idea proposed by Ray et al. [6] was that quantum fluctuations in the transverse SK model can
perhaps lead to some escape routes to ergodicity or quantum fluctuation-induced delocalization
(at least in the low-temperature region of the spin-glass phase) by allowing tunnelling through
such macroscopically tall but thin barriers which are difficult to scale using classical fluctuations.
This is based on the observation that the escape probability due to quantum tunnelling, from a
valley with single barrier of height N and width w, scales as exp(—/Nw/Iy), where Jj, represents
the quantum fluctuation strength (or tunnelling probability) [7]. This extra handle through the
barrier width w (absent in thermal escape probability) can help in its vanishing limit. This has
led to some important clues (see e.g. the discussions in this regard in [8]). In fact, the recent
rigorous study [9] on the transverse SK spin glass provides some support for this aspect in the
low-temperature limit, implying the possibility of quantum annealing (see also [10]). In parallel
the adiabatic quantum computation in the same context of such NP-hard computational problems
was developed [11].

The quantum annealing technique was finally launched through the paper by Kadowaki &
Nishimori [12] and its experimental demonstration by Brooke et al. [13]. Soon, a superconducting-
circuit quantum Ising glass annealing machine was developed [14] (and later marketed) by the
D-wave systems. Since then, a revolution has taken place through a surge of outstanding papers
both in theory and experiment and these intense and massive studies in the last two decades led
finally to the birth of this new age of quantum information and technologies.
