nly reckoned in one direction, viz., from west towards east. The other system of
sasures employs the same imaginary sphere, but the great circle which is used is
t which lies in the plane of the earth’s Equator, and the measures from it are called
inations instead of latitudes, and the coordinate measures are called right ascen-
yns instead of longitudes, which are reckoned as in the other case, only from west
owards east. Thus the place of a star may be given either in latitude and longitude,
in right ascension and declination; and if nothing occurred to disturb the
echanical conditions of the orbit, this alternative reckoning would remain constant,
r altered only by the exceedingly slow proper motion of some of the stars; and the
summer and winter solstices and the spring and autumn equinoxes would occur in
ach succeeding year at the exact moment when the sun occupied the same longitude
ss on the previous one. This, however, is found not to be the case; and the first
recorded statement of the fact is attributed to the Greek astronomer, HippaRcHus.
It must, however, have been practically known to the Egyptians long before his time.
he explanation was reserved for Newron, who showed that owing to certain gravi-
ational reactions upon our planet, especially on the part of the Moon, the earth’s
olar axis, whilst remaining nearly constant in its inclination to the plane of the
cliptic, is continually deflected in such a manner that the recurrence of the equinoxes
fof which the exact moment can be more easily observed than that of the solstices) is
celerated to the extent of about the twentieth part of a degree annually. This
ovement necessarily disturbs the relation which exists at any particular epoch
tween the latitude and longitude, and the right ascension and declination
ckonings. During the course of a few years, indeed, the difference is not great, but
hen years are counted by thousands, the changes in right ascension have to be
koned in hours. And although the latitude is not much affected, the changes in
