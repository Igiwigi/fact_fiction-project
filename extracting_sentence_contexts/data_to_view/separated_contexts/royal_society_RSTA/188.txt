Rayleigh, treating a stream of infinite depth, avoided the indeterminate-
ness by postulating dissipative forces of a somewhat arbitrary kind. Lamb (ยง 245) discards
the frictional terms in his analysis, but ultimately adjusts his solution (by introducing a
uniform train of waves) so as to make the surface deformation insensible far upstream of
the disturbance. His treatment is restricted by his assumption that the elevation of the free surface
ts everywhere infinitesimal (otherwise solutions could not be superposed): this means that in
his problem the mean depth is the same on both sides of the disturbance, as was not the fact
in our Examples 7 and 8. His results suggest that wave-motion, when it occurs downstream
by reason of the disturbance caused by the barrier, may also extend upstream if (as in this
paper) no dissipative forces are assumed.
