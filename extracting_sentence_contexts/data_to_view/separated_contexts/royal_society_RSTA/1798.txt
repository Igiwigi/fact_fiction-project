But the degree to which the phenomenon
occurs, even with the present exhaustion of the tube, is sufficiently convincing. As in the case of the Diffuse series of Helium, this effect again cannot be described
as a continuous transfer of energy down the series, for if this were the case, \4144
would become visible when enhanced to a greater degree than \4388. It is actually
invisible, and calculation shows that this fact implies that its intensity relatively to
\6678 is not more than doubled. We must therefore repeat the former conclusion
that the strong enhancements of particular lines at low pressure are peculiar to these
lines, and in fact to the three lines \\4471, 4922, 4388, of the two Diffuse series. Under still lower pressure, 14922 may be expected to become quite subordinated to
44388, which is already as strong in our experiments, and in the very low conditions
of pressure in nebule, \\4471, 4388, should therefore be the two most prominent
Helium lines of the Diffuse series.
