Attempts at
classifying aftershocks in earthquake catalogues have relied on simple space-time windowing
approaches [4,5]; single-link graphs based on a distance metric [6]; a context-dependent game-
theoretic combination of above methods [7]; evolving random graphs based on windowing
[8,9]; and a pair-wise nearest-neighbour rescaled space-time-magnitude metric derived from
phenomenological laws [10]. The latter was refined [11] to include a threshold separating
strongly correlated and background events, which emerged from the bimodal distribution of
the nearest-neighbour metric and has since been applied in numerous studies [12-16] with some
variations. It is to be noted that all the above-mentioned tools are in fact statistical, which simply try to
assign a correlation between the events, with causality itself being assumed to be valid above
some prescribed threshold in the correlation. This inability to firmly establish causality is, of
course, understandable, given that seismologists do not have access to a real-time dynamical
state of stress or accurate microscopic knowledge of earthquake nucleation sites inside the Earth. However, a proxy earthquake analogue [17] based on numerical simulations of soft glasses, with
access to the relevant dynamic variables at all scales, in theory, does not suffer such limitations.
