$90 ° MR. L. HILL ON CEREBRAL ANAIMIA AND THE

cortex to excitation has been recorded more than once.* In a case recorded by
so07cH the anesthetic was diminished until the patient reacted to the prick of a pin.
The strength of current employed was intolerable to the tongue. This lack of
excitability cannot be altogether ascribed to the insulation of the motor cells by
non-excitable association areas. The “Hemmung” processes are, I believe, more
marked in some animals than in others, and vary with the condition of the cortex. If
dogs be left quiet for an hour, after the completion of the operation, then the cortical
reactions are far more uniformly obtained. A partial explanation of the confliction
of evidence concerning the excitability of the anemic dog's cortex may be found in
this fact. Moreover some workers may by operative methods cause greater loss of
blood and depression of the vaso-motor centre than others, and thus influence the
results obtained on ligation of the cerebral arteries.

EXPERIMENTAL REsuLts.

By a large series of experiments on dogs and monkeys, I have come to the con-
clusion that partial anzemia sometimes diminishes and abolishes, but more often exalts,
cortical excitability. The exaltation is more evident in young animals, and usually
persists when four of the cerebral arteries have been tied in the dog and three in the
monkey.

Since a dog may normally run about after its cortex has been exposed (Br.
