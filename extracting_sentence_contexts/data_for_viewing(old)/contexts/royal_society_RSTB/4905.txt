can hardly be held to be proved by the present tables.

So far as the tests go I think it must be admitted that the formula given is capable
of representing the facts with considerable precision, more closely indeed than we have
any right to expect. One might well have expected the personal factor in classification,
the practically cataclysmic destruction of species at numerous epochs in geological
time, and all the varied changes that have diversified the organic history of our planet,
to have left so many irregularities in the distribution that any formula could at most
have given a very rough analogy with the general run of the data. But apparently
the formula arrived at can do far more than this. Why this is so seems to me to be a
point which requires some discussion. I return to it briefly below.

Having shown, however, that the formula is capable of closely describing the facts,
we can revert to Table IV, and the actual values of p and +. It will be seen in the
first place that the values found for + range only from 4-26 to 6-28, the unit of time being

the doubling-period for species within the genus in each several case. Time must, there-
fore, be regarded as not merely finite, but short: it is indeed obvious, once the point
is considered, that when the mean size of genus is only some 5 to 15 species time cannot
well be anything but short. It may be as well to emphasise that our unit of time being
a relative unit, its equivalent in years or in geological time will vary from group to group
and can only be determined if the results can effectively and without fallacy be collated
