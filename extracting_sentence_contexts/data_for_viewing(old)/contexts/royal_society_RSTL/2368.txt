[THAT some substances conduct or convey the electric fluid to a distance
better than others, is a fact known to the earliest electricians ; but on what
power or property of the body this superiority depends, is a question on which
different opinions still seem to* prevail. We constantly hear the expressions
< electricity is attracted by metals ; the lightning is attracted by the metallic
points of a conducting rod,” and other expressions of similar import, —all signi-
fying that a powerful attraction does exist between metals and the electric
fluid. Now the contrary is really the fact, those bodies being the best con-
ductors which have the least attraction for the electric fluid. From the
profound mathematical investigations of M. Porsson, and the luminous writings
of M. Bior, it appears that these philosophers consider the metals merely as
forming the passive interior of a vessel, of which the exterior surface is the
ambient air ; and that the electric fluid rushes along between the atmospheric
boundary and the surface of the metal, where it finds an easy passage. We
are therefore to consider the metals as quite passive in the conduction of the
electric fluid, and that the prime mover is the repulsive energy existing between
sIimilar atoms of the compound electric fluid. When a metallic ball connected
with the earth is placed near the prime conductor, the vitreous electricity sur-
rounding the conductor repels the vitreous electricity of the ball, and forces it
to glide along to a greater distance, whilst the ball will now be surrounded by
