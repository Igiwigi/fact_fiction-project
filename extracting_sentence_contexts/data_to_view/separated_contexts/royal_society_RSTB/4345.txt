The inner part of the dorsal end of the otic process reaches up to the skull roof,
or very nearly so ; laterally it is depressed to form with the pro-otic and pterygoid
the lower border of the foramen of the vena capitis dorsalis. Viewed from the outer aspect, the otic process gives origin to the main mass
of the bone, which runs forwards and inwards and upwards as a processus ascendens,
separated by a deep narrow notch, widening into a foramen, from the otic process. On the endocranial surface the ascending process forms a large area lying outside
the original cranial wall (whose position is indicated by the posterior end of the
sphenethmoid), The bone articulates with, may in fact be fused to, the antero-
lateral corner of the basisphenoid. Just above the dorsal surface of this bone
the inner surface of the epipterygoid is crossed by a very deep and narrow groove,
whose outer end opens by a notch at the front border of the bone. Posteriorly,
this groove is overhung by a delicate process which joins or nearly joins the anterior
and lower corner of the pro-otic.
