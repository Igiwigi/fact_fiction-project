Similarly, in human myocytes, blockade of x, by HMR-1556 caused significant
APD prolongation when repolarization reserve was reduced (by Jk, block)
and sympathetic activation was present (Jost et al. 2005). In an experimental
model of rabbit with AV block-induced long QT interval and TdP, Jk; (among
other currents) was found to be reduced by 50 per cent (Tsuji et al. 2002).
Cheng & Kodama (2004) also suggest that J, (and Jx,) is likely to contribute to
arrhythmogenesis in diseased hearts via the spatially heterogeneous prolongation
of APD.

Ixy is considered to be the most widely targeted K* channel linked to
potential arrhythmogenicity. The evaluation of the effects of drugs on hERG-
encoded ion channels is considered of primary importance in preclinical tests.
In fact, a relationship between blockage of Jk, at therapeutic concentrations
and risk of onset of TdP through delayed repolarization is now generally
accepted in drug evaluation (Gintant et al. 2006). For example, cisapride, a
gastrointestinal prokinetic agent (Carlsson et al. 1997), and terfenadine, a non-
sedating antihistamine (Roy et al. 1996), were both withdrawn from the market
between 1997 and 2000 owing to their hERG block effects.
