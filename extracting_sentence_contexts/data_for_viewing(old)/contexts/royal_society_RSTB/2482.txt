256 DR. B. DYER ON A CHEMICAL STUDY OF PHOSPHORIC ACID AND

27 inches so nearly correspond with the estimated excess of phosphoric acid per
acre, it will be seen that the citric-acid-soluble phosphoric acid in 10a, after
decreasing greatly between 1865 and 1881, seems since to have risen, especially in
the lower depths; and that that in 10x, during the latter period, having decreased
largely in the surface soil, has risen in the subsoil to almost the same extent.
Each plot between 1881 and 1893 yielded in its crops nearly 109 Ibs. per acre
of phosphoric acid (104, 97 lbs., and 108, 109 Ibs.), a loss which is approximately
indicated in the total phosphoric acid of the surface soil. This loss is not, however,
indicated in the citric-acid-soluble figures for Plot 10a. On Plot 10p rather less
than half the loss is seen in the citric-soluble for the first depth, but it is made up
for by the increase in the subsoil. Both surface soils, in fact, have sunk to the same
low level, in citric-acid-soluble phosphoric acid, as the continuously unmanured
Plot 3, or slightly below it, the quantity in 10a being distinctly lower than that in
Plot 3 in the second depth, while 10s is slightly higher. All three soils would seem
to have reached the stage at which the surface soils maintain a fairly constant
minimum of citric-soluble phosphoric acid, probably dependent mainly on the annual
decay of the crop residues, viz., roots and stubble; while the quantity in the subsoil
has, during recent years, been probably reinforced by an inerease of deep root-
growth, as the roots have to extend their feeding areaâ€”not merely to obtain
phosphoric acid, but in the case of Plot 3 to get nitrogen, and in the case of both
3 and 10 to get potash and other minerals,
