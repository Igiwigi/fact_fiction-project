Having thus endeavoured to develope the fundamental relations which subsist
between all strictly Vital phenomena, by showing that a * correlation” may be traced
among the several forces to whose agency they are attributable, it is the author's
purpose to inquire, whether any similar relation can be shown to exist between the
vital and the physical forces. In the conduct of this inquiry, it will be adyantageous to take, as our starting-
point, a case in which the existence of such a correlation appears particularly ob-
vious; that, namely, of Nervous Force, the strong analogy of which to Electricity is
admitted by all who do not believe in the identity of these two agents. The disproof
of their identity will be found, the author believes, in the numerous experiments of
Prof. Marrevecr and others, who have failed to procure any manifestations of a
change in the electric state of nerves, through whose agency muscular contractions
were being most vigorously excited ; and in the well-known fact, that the conduction
of nervous force is prevented by pressure on the nerve-trunk, or by other disorgan-
izing changes, which do not impair its power of conducting electricity. All the facts
which have been adduced in support of the identity of these two forces will be found
readily explicable on the idea of their © correlation” or mutual convertibility ;—elec-
tricity, when acting through nerve-fibres, developing nervous force; and nervye-force,
when operating upon a certain special form of apparatus, developing electricity. This view the author purposes now to unfold in more detail; adducing in support of
it facts which are s0 well known to physiologists and electricians, that there can be
no occasion to do more than cite them.
