Therefore, the function to be minimized (corresponding to minimizing initial delocalization)
for obtaining correct ICs for a generalized LPT is the term in the parentheses in equation (6.3):

A UA 1 1, 8 f

where there is the constraint ti 1,0 € [0,1]. The minimum point of the function in equation (6.4) is

The corresponding finite though small minimum delocalization (coupling) energy (in k units)
reads:

Emin = — + ~ 0.0048. 6.6
M Koo 3 xt (6.6)

Had we used ginf instead of gy, we would have obtained the result ie Ke 3 * 0.667 instead
130
of 0.657. Next, employing equations (3.19)-(3.21), (4.6), (6.3), (6.5) and (6.6), we obtain the IC for the
averaged Hamiltonian corresponding to the (generalized) LPT:

The notation hcr(0,0) was used in equation (6.7) due to the fact that sin?(y/2) =hio /N? =
(64/24N?) nae 0 and hence yp — 0 (and the choice #9 = 0 was already justified earlier). The value

of N becomes very large for vanishing foundation stiffness because N* = J + fz and the actions
are both normalized by k; and thus their sum becomes large for k; — 0 because in the impact
regime at least one of the (non-normalized) actions is at least finite (and positive). The subscript ‘cr’ was used for both the Hamiltonian and the coupling due to the fact that
some of the assumptions used in the asymptotic derivations presented above are justifiable only
in the case of considerable energy exchange between the modes, which for the generalized LPT
corresponds to the critical case.
