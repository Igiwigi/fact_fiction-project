a yet further division®,

'These ideas, however philosophical and suggestive, are yet, it must be allowed, very
hypothetical. The proof of the compound nature of a chemical substance is of a very
simple kind. It lies in the fact, that it has been made by the composition of certain
parts, or broken up into those parts, or at least in some phenomena which are sup-
posed to be the evidence of this. Indeed the rational formula of a chemical snb-
stance is but a memorandum of its reactions, and a particular mode of expressing
the law of the synthesis and analysis of the body, apart from which it has but little
meaning. The true nature therefore and chemical formula of the elemental bodies,
as of all other substances, is to be discovered by the study of the series of che-
mical changes in which they are formed, and by the phenomena which they pre-
sent when they pass into the combined condition. There are even well-known facts
of great importance in this point of view, some unexplained, and some, I conceive,
misinterpreted,

The point which I shall seek to establish is this,—that at the moment of chemical
change a chemical difference exists between the particles of which certain elemental
bodies consist, perfectly the same in kind to that which exists between the particles
of compound substances under similar circumstances, and on which the phenomena
of combination and decomposition depend. That a peculiar chemical relation exists
between two particles which combine, is generally admitted and expressed by the
term affinity. 'The electro-chemical theory has defined more exactly in what this
affinity consists, and states that the two particles are to one another in a positive and
negative electric relation. But I do not know that it has ever been pointed out that this
