Finally, in [74], it is
shown that every Bayesian framework must include a set of ideal experiments that must
satisfy the EP.

(b’) As we have seen before, the toy examples in [7,58] (i.e. Specker’s triangle and Wright’s
pentagon) are impossible or trivial, depending on whether or not we make the
assumption that measurements are ideal.

(c’) Observation (c) is not an obstacle but an opportunity. The fact that a behaviour p(S) fails
to satisfy the EP applied to n copies indicates that p(S) is forbidden under assumptions 3.1
and 3.2.

(f) Bohmian mechanics, many-worlds and QBism

It is interesting to compare the explanation of the origin of the Born rule suggested in this paper
with other explanations given by some interpretations of quantum theory. In the Bohmian interpretation [75-77], measurement outcomes are determined by a field
(called the quantum potential) that permeates the universe. Each particle is at a certain position,
and this position is governed by the quantum potential.
