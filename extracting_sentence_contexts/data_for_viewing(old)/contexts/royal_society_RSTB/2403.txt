(3.) The “retention of the megaspore,” involving,

character.

Against the interpretation of the envelope as an integument it may be urged that
this structure in Lepidocarpon, springs from the sporophyll and not from the
sporangium. That however is an objection of little or no weight. Many morpho-
logists have regarded the integument as a leaflet or a ligule, others as an indusium ;
on any of these views it would be an organ originally springing from the leaf and
free from the sporangium. That an organ at first merely surrounding the sporan-
gium should eventually come to be inserted upon it is perfectly intelligible ; floral
morphology abounds in parallel cases of “ congenital adhesion.” In fact it is unlikely,
a priori, that the integument at its first origin formed part of the sporangium ; in
that case we should have to regard it not merely as a new formation, but as a structure
absolutely without homologue among Cryptogams, whereas protective outgrowths
from the leaf are common enough among them.

* In Isoetes also, a genus more closely allied to our fossil, the velum forms a kind of integument,
though not much like that of a seed. The narrow opening of the velum in such species as Isoetes Hystrix
was even termed by ALEX. BrAuN the “ micropyle.”
