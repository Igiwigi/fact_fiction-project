Lucina goldfussi. This rich fauna shows more affinity with the Osmington Oolite Coral Rag than with
any other part of the Corallian, even the occurrence of Astarte ovata being paralleled in
the base of the Littlemore section. A further analogy between this and the other
occurrences of the Littlemore Clay Beds lies in the fact that the Corallian escarpment
is here breached by a modern stream, a tributary of the River Marden. If we follow the outcrop of the Corallian southward into Dorsetshire we find the same
type of rock repeated at intervals in other localities, always in the same stratigraphical
position but varying greatly in the richness of its fauna, according probably to the distance
from the nearest reefs and the source of the mud-bearing currents. In the deep road-
cutting 8. of Sturminster Newton, Dorset, the clays and nodular mudstone bands are
exposed to a thickness of 12 ft.; here they are rich in Nucleolites scutatus and other
fossils, including Chlamys qualicosta, They separate the basal pisolite of Dorset from
the false-bedded series of the Marnhull and Todber Freestones.
