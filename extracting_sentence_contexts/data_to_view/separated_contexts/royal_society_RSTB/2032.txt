M. Wiesneri agrees
closely with the Malayan fern in the form of pinnules and in the occurrence of
anastomosing veins below the sorus; the sorus appears to be indusiate and circular. KRaAssEr gives figures of a pinnule of the recent species,{ but, like other authors, he
overlooks the fact that the lateral veins are often connected by arching branches. The Moravian species differs from M. GÃ©pperti and agrees with Matonia pectinata in
the small number of sori on the fertile segments.
