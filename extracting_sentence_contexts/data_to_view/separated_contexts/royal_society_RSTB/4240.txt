In addition, it would seem that at times a number of
deaths, which should have been distributed over a series of weeks, are collected into
one entry. Thus, for example, an entry of 100 deaths, though this is an extreme
case, is given as occurring in one week, though the number of deaths in the weeks
immediately preceding and following are barely one-fourth of this. That the
figures are not a misprint is shown by the fact that the total for the year corresponds
to this entry. It is, of course, possible that a return from some large childrenâ€™s
institution, such as the Foundling Hospital, might furnish the majority of these
deaths, or that, on the other hand, there may have been an error in the original
manuscript. Further, some of the epidemies recorded are exceedingly large.
