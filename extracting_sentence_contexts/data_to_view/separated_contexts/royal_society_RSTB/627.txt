“‘Scnorps, VAN Deen, and STituine have observed that sensibility is not lost in the
limb or limbs behind, and on the side of the section of the lateral half of the spinal
cord; but they have not remarked the most important fact, that on the opposite side
there is anesthesia. They also do not mention this curious result of this experiment,
the existence of hyperesthesia on the side of the injury. [May not this have been because these observers did not find any facts to warrant
the inference of hypereesthesia on the same side, and anesthesia of the opposite ?—

“ FopERA was very near discovering that there is a decussation of the sensitive fibres
in the spinal cord. He says he has found, in some cases, that a section of one of the
posterior columns caused a diminution of sensibility in the opposite side of the body ;
but that in other cases he has seen the reverse. He also has sometimes remarked
that the section of one of the posterior columns causes hypereesthesia on the same side,
and that a section of these two columns produces hypersthesia on the two sides, but
he declares, also, that he has seen the reverse.
