plot 8 without than on plot 7 with the potass. Of chlorine also much less was taken
up on plot 8. Of silica, which was not supplied, eyen rather more was taken up
without than with the potass, but with this exception, and that of soda already
referred to, less of every mineral constituent was taken up on plob 8 without than on
plot 7 with the potass. Of percentage in the dry substance of the produce, however,
that of lime, magnesia, phosphoric acid, su]phuric acid, and chlorine, was nearly the
same without and with the potass; that of soda and of silica was much higher, but
that of potass was not two-thirds as high, without the potass, though it was still much
higher than without manure, as also was the percentage of phosphoric acid ; but that
of the other constituents was, for the most part, much the same as withoub manure,
excepting the lime, which was considerably less both without and with the potass.

A consideration of the facts enumerated can leave no doubt that it was to a relative
deficiency of available potass that the falling off, not only in the total weight of produce,
but also in the description, and in the character of development, of the herbage, is to
be attributed.

Notwithstanding the great reduction in the amount of produce, and in the amount
of potass taken off in the crop, after the cessation of its application, there was still, in
every one of the 14 years, much more potass taken up than without manure. There
was, however, something like a gradual reduction of the excess from year to year, and
ib averaged not much more than half as much over the second as over the first seven of
the 14 years. Tt is obvious, therefore, that the unexhansted residue of the potass
applied during the first six years has, in a considerable proportion at any rate, remained
in the s0il within the range of the roots, but that only a limited and gradually decreasing
