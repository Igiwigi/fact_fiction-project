will possibly be negligible for any actual problem.

Let us then consider a single electron represented by a charge ¢ moving along the
direction of the axis of « with velocity v. The components of rotation in the medium
due to its presence are at any instant — e (d/dwx, d/dy, d/dz) r~', and those of the
displacement current are derived from them by operating with the factor — v d/dzx.
This displacement current is the curl of the velocity of the medium, whence it may
be easily verified that this velocity is ev (0, — d/dz, d/dy) 7—', being a circulation round
the line of motion of the electron.t The kinetic energy is thus 4 (ev)*J(y° + #) 7° dr;

* Professor FrrzGeratp remarks that it might, conceivably, resist absolute linear displacement, A

pothesis of this sort, which is on a lower plane than those mentioned above, is in fact involved in the

nal expositions of Fresnen’s dynaraics of double refraction.

+ It is to be observed that we cannot expect to obtain an expression for the displacement in the
