[21-24] compared to the strong fields from large hand-held coils (e.g. 50-100 mm in diameter)
commonly used in transcranial magnetic stimulation (e.g. 60-100 Vm_) [66], it is less likely that
stimulation from microcoils will induce any significant damage to the neural tissue even at the
strongest levels. Lastly, the high current levels required for micro-magnetic stimulation (e.g. 200-
500 mA) raise concerns as to whether excessive heating or damage to the surrounding neural
tissue may occur. To explore this, we measured the temperature on the surface of microcoils
during repetitive magnetic stimulation at the strongest current level (718 mA; see Materials and
Methods). The average maximum temperature increases were less than 0.5°C (not shown), well
below the threshold for thermal activation of neurons (greater than 43°C) [52,53] and the threshold
for thermal damage to neurons (greater than 60°C) [54]. The relatively small increase in coil
temperature may be due to the fact that the coil has a very low DC resistance compared to
the electrode (e.g. 0.76 Q for microcoils versus 0.4-1 MQ for electrodes), so even with the high
current levels the power dissipation in the coil does not increase significantly. We estimated that
the energy per pulse for a magnetic waveform with an amplitude of 200-500 mA is 3-19 pJ, which
is comparable to that of deep brain stimulation (0.8-10 pJ) [63] and cortical surface electrodes
(2.59 pJ) [1]. Although further studies on the effects of coil heating are necessary, our results and
estimation suggest that the high levels of current (200-500 mA) flowing in the coils with a very
low resistance (less than 1 2) may not induce significant temperature changes in the neural tissue.
