the common alkaline phosphates and arseniates are mixed with a solution containing
an additional equivalent of base, while no change of temperature occurs when a
Solution of the pyrophosphate of soda is similarly treated. In the former case, it has
been shown by Mr. Granam that an atom of basic water is displaced by an atom of
alkali ; in the latter case, no basic water is present.

In the preceding observations it has been as8umed, that if the union of two sub-
stances be attended with the evolution of a certain definite quantity of heat, their
separation will be attended with the absorption of the same quantity of heat.
Although this proposition in the abstract is very probable, it requires to be demon-
strated by direct experiment, and it is the more important to do $0, as it will furnish,
if true, a means of verifying the accuracy of our results. The reactions now described
enable us to test it by experiment in one particular set of cases. In fact, if we take
three bases, such as potash, oxide of copper, and water, capable of displacing one
another in the above order, and if we measure the changes of temperature produced
when the first and second, first and third, and second and third bases displace one
another, then the change of temperature arising from the first snbstitution should be
equal to the difference between the changes of temperature produced by the two
latter. A few examples will illustrate this point.

The numbers expressing the heat developed when the nitrate of water is decom-
pozed by potash and lime are 6*76 and 720. The difference of these numbers is
— 044, indicating that a depression of temperature to that amount ought to take
place when the former base is snbstituted for the latter. We have before seen that
the result of the direct experiment is —0*37. In this and the following cases, the
