G the smallness of the increment observed on doubling the amount of gas was not due to
= the partial exhaustion of the source by the first quantity of gas. The heat of the

< Here, then, we see what a powerful effect density, or the internal resistance which
2 accompanies density, has on the mobility of a gas; and there is every reason to suppose
5 that the mobility of hydrogen is due to the comparative absence, in its case, of internal
A resistance. However this may be, the foregoing experiment enables us to draw some
important inferences.

Storms at great heights must be greatly facilitated by the mobility of the particles of
the air. In fact storms are cases of convection on a large scale, and in our front cham-
ber we had one in miniature, With the same difference of temperature on the summit
of Mont Blanc, the motion of convection would be very nearly twice as great as at the
sea-level.

In the swmmer of 1859 I was fortunate enough to induce my friend Professor
FRANKLAND to accompany me to the 8ummit of Mont Blanc, and to determine the com-

parative rates of combustion there and in the yalley of Chamouni. Six candles were
