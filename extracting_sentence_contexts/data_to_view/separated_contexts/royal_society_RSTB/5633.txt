The secretion of the interstitial tissue has therefore been produced
and is available after the removal of the testes of the fish. The secretion of the interstitial tissue alone is not sufficient to cause the development
of the secondary sexual characters, nor is its activity conditioned by a threshold tem-
perature (p. 245). The fact that it is not necessary to maintain the temperature above
a critical value is significant, since it will be recalled that in many of the experiments
the fish was subjected to a rise of temperature prior to the full development of the
interstitial tissue. It is evident therefore that the rise of temperature affects directly neither the inter-

stitial tissue nor the interstitial hormone, but it must act on some organ or organs to
cause them to react with the interstitial hormone.
