Such
deviations from the law pk = constant could be ascribed to variations in the size
of the cluster constituting the ion; however, they follow readily from the expression
(«) of the mobility if we take into account the deviation from the law of MaxwELi
which states that the coefficient of viscosity of a gas or vapour is independent of its
density. In the case of gases it is known that y diminishes as the pressure is reduced
beyond a certain value ;* such a diminution would, according to the theory here
given, produce an increase in the value of pk. In the case of vapours it has been
established that 7 increases rapidly as the saturated state is approached ; in fact, as a
result of WarpurG and von Bazo’s experiments on the viscosity of CO, at high
pressures, Meyer} came to the conclusion that the experimental values above certain
pressures could be explained only by supposing carbon dioxide to behave as a liquid,
the density of which is practically independent of pressure ; an increase in the value
of » would, according to the expression («), diminish the product pk, a result in
accordance with experimental observations.

10. Summary.

1. The velocities of the positive and negative ions produced by Réntgen rays in
4 gases and 15 vapours have been measured at normal temperatures over a wide
range of pressures and under different electric intensities.
