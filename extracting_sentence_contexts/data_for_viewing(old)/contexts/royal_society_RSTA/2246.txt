of gases. Using Lagrange’s equations of motion, they characterized the motion in terms of kinetic
and potential energies and generalized coordinates, avoiding any mention of forces. Hicks praises
this step as, ‘the next great advance in theory’ after Helmholtz’s 1858 paper [7, p. 60]. The method
was favoured by the North British physicists for analysing situations where they wished to
postulate an underlying mechanism. Maxwell pointed to the difference from astronomy where
Newtonian theory worked well, for its role was purely to account for the observations. However,

when we ... believe that the phenomena which fall under our observation form but a very
small part of what is really going on in the system, the question is... what is the most
general specification ... consistent with the condition that the motions of those parts of the
system which we can observe are what we find them to be? It is to Lagrange ... that we
owe the method which enables us to answer this question without asserting either more or
less than all that can be legitimately deduced from the observed facts [60, pp. 781-782].

But Kelvin and Tait’s application of the method to vortices was widely attacked, for example
by Ludwig Boltzmann, John Purser (Professor of Mathematics at the Queen’s College, Belfast),
and Carl Neumann [61]. The problem was the lack of any proof of the validity of the equations
in situations where there were infinite degrees of freedom, which were not recognized in the
generalized coordinates.

In the second edition of their Treatise Kelvin and Tait re-affirmed their commitment to the
method by promoting a process they termed ‘ignoration of coordinates’ [59, p. 327]. It was
essentially the same as that developed 2 years earlier by the Cambridge mathematician Edward
Routh in his Adams Prize essay on stability of motion, leading to a ‘modified Lagrangian’ [62].
The ignorable coordinates (later termed cyclic) were those that did not appear explicitly in the
