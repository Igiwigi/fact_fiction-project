multiple reasons, such as the existence of cut-off frequencies for low-frequency perturbations, a
particular structure of the magnetic field with horizontal structures dominating over the vertical
ones at some height, the non-adiabaticity of perturbations due to radiation, etc. The power map
ratios shown at the right reveal considerable differences in the behaviour of vorticity between
the three simulations. Ambipolar diffusion creates a deficit of vorticity above 200 km. The lower
‘absorption’ band between 200 and 500km has a maximum toward high frequencies. Since the
action of the non-ideal effects, such as ambipolar diffusion, is supposed to increase toward small
scales, the observed behaviour must be related to the dissipation of small-scale vorticity motions.
Unlike that, the absorption bands at heights above 500 km peak at lower frequencies. This fact is
indicative of the overall reorganization of the magnetic structure being responsible for the lack of
the vorticity in the AMBI simulations.

The simulations with the Hall effect show an excess of vorticity above 500 km both relative to
the BATT and AMBI simulations up to a factor 2. The dependence of this excess on frequency


shows a weak maximum at low frequencies, and therefore is indicative of global magnetic
structure changes. Comparing figure 3 with fig. 3 from Paper II, it becomes evident that Q., is
affected by the ambipolar and Hall effects in a similar way as the incompressible field-aligned
perturbation, fai¢ =) - V x v. Therefore, the ambipolar effect provides a mechanism to dissipate
vortices, i.e. to extract energy from the vortices and convert it into thermal energy of the plasma
