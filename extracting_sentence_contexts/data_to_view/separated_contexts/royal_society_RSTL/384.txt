In
each solar system, we have a very ponderous attractive centre,
by which all the planets, satellites, and comets are governed,
and kept in their orbits. Sidereal systems take a greater scope :
the stars of which they are composed move round an empty
centre, to which they are nevertheless as firmly bound as the
planets to their massy one. It is however not necessary here to
enlarge on distinctions which will hereafter be strongly sup-
ported by facts, when clusters of stars come to be considered. I' shall only add, that in the subordinate bodies of the solar
system itself, we have already instances, in miniature, as it may
be called, of the principle whereby the laws of attraction are
applicable to the solution of the most complicated phenomena
of the heavens, by means of revolutions round empty centres. For, although both the earth and its moon are retained in their
orbits by the sun, yet their mutual subordinate system is such,
that they perform secondary monthly revolutions round a centre
without a body placed-in it.
