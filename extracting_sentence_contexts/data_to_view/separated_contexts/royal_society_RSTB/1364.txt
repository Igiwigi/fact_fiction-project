Photograph 2 shows one of the ‘lenticular organs,”
Band one of the leaf-traces, which is especially clear. These facts demonstrate that
‘othe section passes through a node, and therefore that the axis is a stem. This
Sconclusion is further strengthened by the fact that immediately above the node we
‘find the base of a branch fgivohabby abortive) which is thus in the normal position for
&branches of the stem of Calamites.t
% This specimen may therefore safely be regarded as affording additional evidence
that organs with “ Astromyelon” structure, were borne on Calamitean stems.
© The nature of the organs hitherto known under the name of Astromyelon, is now
Es far established that we know them to have been appendages of the stem of
¥ Calamites (Arthropitys of the French authors). Renautr has shown that very
§ similar appendages, also showing the Astromyelon type of structure, were produced
: on the stems of Bornia and Chlamodendn on.§ So far as our English specimens of
3 « A “ Astromyelon” ave concerned, we have no reason to doubt that they all belonged to
the genus Calamites, though it is very probable that various species may be
represented among them. ‘The direct evidence of continuity applies only to the larger
Specimens, such as those originally described, in which there is a conspicuous pith.||

* The proof that these organs are, morphologically, roots, will be fully given below.
