ScHENK
examined some of Hrer’s specimens and noticed a resemblance to Sciadopitys in cuti-
cular structure. Later Hatie confirmed ScuEenk’s opinion and added considerably to
our knowledge of the leaf structure. The material collected in 1921 does not enable me
to add anything to the facts already published ; the length of the xeromorphic leaves
varies from 5 to 12 mm. and the breadth from 1-5 to 2 mm. Localities —Upernivik Island, Pagtorfik, Kak, Ikorfat, Angiarsuit (loc. A.).
