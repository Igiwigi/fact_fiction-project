instance, of submerged sandbars will complicate the profile and make necessary an analysis
by sections (plates 5-6).

(hk) Dark beaches. It has been assumed in the foregoing that the beach material was suffi-

ciently reflective for the term (R- 5 en) in equation (1) to be positive, so that B, decreased
as the depth of the water increased. It will be apparent, however, that if R = eH , the

brightness of the sea-bed will not change with depth. If R is numerically less than Tah By?
B, will increase with depth due to scattering by particles suspended in the column of water
above the sea-bed. .

Submerged rocks may in fact appear lighter in tone on vertical air photographs as their
depth increases. The brightness profiles shown in figure 4 demonstrate the same effect;
they were constructed from a photograph of black and white objects submerged at known
depths in a water tank, and it will be noted that both profiles have the same B,, value and
both give the same extinction coefficient for the water.

Brightness profiles of dark surfaces have a relatively low (B)â€”B.,)/B., ratio and a relatively
low sensitivity to changes in depth. The use of a blue filter when taking the photographs
would, from the curves of figure 2, be expected to increase this sensitivity by increasing the
scattering recorded within the column of water above the dark surface. The results obtained
in this way with a blue filter are described in part III.
