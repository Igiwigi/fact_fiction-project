The sacral ribs are strong
ute processes, very similar to those of a crocodile, they are directed outwards
tle downwards, with expanded extremities, the hinder one being the largest
its wide outer end oblique to the longitudinal axis of the vertebre
This large rib, it is tolerably evident, was attached to the posterior
ty of the ilium, which is but little out of place. mterior sacral vertebra has been troublesome to interpret, as it is not only
te of place but is partly broken, and the centrum is not shown. At first rt
ttain whether this was part of the sacrum ; and the fact that the centrum
ed to the other two, as they were to each other, seemed to militate against

this interpretation, but a close examination has convinced me that it is cor
the pre-sacral vertebrae, as we have seen, the transverse processes become sn
we pass backwards, and are very small in the vertebra immediately in front of |
now in question, which retains, on the right side, a long and strong proe
rib) with an expanded end, quite as long as that of the vertebra next be
although not so stout (Plate 55, fig. 4, sa, 1). The corresponding process of
side has been separated from the vertebra, and is seen in the stone just ab
ribs of the two hinder sacral vertebree.
