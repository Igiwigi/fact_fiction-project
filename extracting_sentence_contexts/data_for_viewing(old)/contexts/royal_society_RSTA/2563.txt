(n + 1)th row, one has to duplicate the nth row and add another square, and so there are n + 1
squares in the (1 + 1)th row. Thus, ‘an intuitive version of mathematical induction’ allows one

to see that for any n, the number of squares in the nth row will be n. Therefore, calculating :8

"i requires calculating the total number of squares in the diagram, which is n?/2 + n/2, Ss
by the formula for the area of a triangle plus the number of squares supplied by the shaded : =
half-squares. 7

Note that Chihara’s suggested induction does not lead directly to the theorem: rather, it leads : a
to the result that )>/"_, i is the number of squares in the diagram with n rows. Put another way, : =
Chihara’s induction shows that the diagram (3.1) can be extended to any number of rows 1 : =
without changing the fact that its area is )~'' , i. It is from this statement that the result is then 1B
deduced. By contrast, the non-spatial induction leads directly to the result. Thus, it cannot be : =
the case that greater simplicity of the spatial proof is just because the diagram serves to guide 8
the reader through the induction in a way that is simpler than the non-spatial proof, for the two : o
inductions have different conclusions. in

It does not seem relevant whether Chihara’s account of the thought-process is seen as : =
extracting an induction encoded in the diagram, or as constructing an induction suggested by : S
it: the point is that if the proof is through an induction triggered by the diagram, it must be oN

simpler than the induction in the non-spatial proof. Of course, the spatial proof does not require
any notation and is simpler in that respect, but it seems difficult to identify other ways in which
it is simpler.
