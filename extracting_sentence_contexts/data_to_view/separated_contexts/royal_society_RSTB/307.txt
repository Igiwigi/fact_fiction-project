They were all once slender twigs, and I am convinced that such series of
sections as abound in my cabinet, corresponding to those now represented in my
figures 7-15, are illustrations of twigs and branches of the same plant in successive
stages of their growth. I should also like to remark on the objection that in this and some of the preceding
Memoirs I am in danger of establishing new species without sufficiently defining
them. In fact, the establishment of species of Coal-plants in the strict sense of the
word has not been my object. â€˜The difficulties in the way of doing this are, in my
judgment, insuperable. In the earlier of this series of Memoirs I made no attempt to
attach specific names to the objects which I described. I mainly sought to throw new
light upon the morphology and histology of the Carboniferous plants.
