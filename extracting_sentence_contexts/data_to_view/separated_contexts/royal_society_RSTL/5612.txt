FAIRBAIRN ON THE RESISTANCE OF TUBES TO COLLAPSE.

8quare inch ; hence it appears that a considerable reduction of tenacity must be
for the riveting of the plates. The ratio of reduction is in this case $. One remarkable fact distinetly established by these experiments, is the com:
weakness of tubes subjected to external pressure. If p be put for the internal
per 8quare inch at which a tube is ruptured, then for tubes of the same thickness
diameter, we find from (6.) and (7.) the following relation of strength :;—

9p 4
P=1341 FF

If L=2Z and £=043, then =7:77; that is to say, in this case the tube subje
to internal pressure will have about 74 times the strength of a similar tube subj
external pressure. When

p=P,
we find
L=13:44k""9,

If k=-25, then we find L=32 feet nearly ; that is, a tube of this length and thi
will be equally strong whether subjected to external or internal pressure.
