In the present paper it is shown that there is a
close relation between the anatomical structure of wood and the anisotropy of its
elasticity, and that at least a partial explanation of most of its elastic properties can be
obtained by studying this relation. It may be added that the word elastic is used here
in its wider sense. Wood is not truly elastic in the restricted mathematical sense of
the term, for it exhibits considerable plasticity for certain types of deformation, a fact
which will have to be taken into account when the so-called moduli of rigidity are
discussed. § 3. Anatomical Structure of Wood.—Microscopic examination of wood material shows
that the structural units of wood are various types of wood-cells, the more conspicuous
features of its structure, such as the annual layers and the medullary rays, bemg due to
the gross arrangement of these cells.
