The Edo
period samples originated from the Ikenohata-Shichikencho
site [43], which is located in Taito-ku, Tokyo. The excavation
of this site was undertaken between 1993 and 1995 and
yielded about six hundred graves which belong to the period
from the late seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries [43]. The
graves represented samurai and townsmen, known from the

fact that the burials contained ceramic coffins (kamekan) and
wooden coffins (mokkan) that were used for samurai and
commoners, respectively. Dental calculus was removed from specimens as previously
described [44]. Briefly, a sterile dental pick was used to carefully
remove dental calculus from one side of one tooth, and the speci-
men was placed in a sterile plastic bag for transport at room
temperature to the Australian Centre for Ancient DNA at the
University of Adelaide.
