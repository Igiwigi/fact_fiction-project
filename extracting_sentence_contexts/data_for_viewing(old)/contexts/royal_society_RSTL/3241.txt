seen it in both of those localities, it would have been impossible for me at least to un-
derstand it in the uterus. And in proof that others failed to do 80, it may be stated
that ova of the Dog measuring half a line, have been described by eminent obseryers
as consisting of a single membrane; whereas in the Rabbit, according to my obser-
vations, ova of still minuter size may consist of four membranes in addition to the
embryo, (one of these membranes being composed of two laminz) ; to which it may
be added, that I find one membrane to disappear by liquefaction within the ovum
while the latter is in the Fallopian tube.

From what has been stated, it will be obvious that in undertaking researches in 80
difficult a snbject as that of embryology, the mind should not be pre-occupied with
any theory. I certainly had none to establish. If I was at all prepossessed, it was in
favour of existing doctrines; and it has been in s$pite of such prepossession that fact
after fact has gradually but irresistibly compelled me to form other views. In the
following pages there will be found no speculations, as I have confined myself to a
simple delineation of appearances, and to the most obvious conclusions arising from
them. If in any points I have been mistaken, that indulgence will, I trust, be ac-
corded which may be fairly claimed in exploring one of the most hidden regions of
physiology. That in the main facts I have not erred seems probable, from the re-
peated opportunities afforded for their confirmation. The number of Rabbits ex-
amined considerably exceeds a hundred, and I have recorded in my notes the particular
results regarding eighty-nine. Besides ova that were till present in the ovary and
apparently destined to escape, ninety-three have been found in the Fallopian tube, and
two hundred and thirty-six in the uterns. I have kept a separate record of the
measurements and other particulars of most of these. Tables will be given (par. 319.),
