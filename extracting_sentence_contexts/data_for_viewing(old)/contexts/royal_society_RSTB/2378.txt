C. Histological examination of the degenerated nerves,
8. General conclusions.

The histological part of the work has been carried out entirely by one of us
(F. W. M.). The experiments in which living animals were employed were carried
out entirely by the other (W. D. H.) at King’s College, In this part of the work cats
were exclusively employed. The animals were aneesthetised with the A.C.E. (alcohol,
chloroform, ether) mixture during the operation, and rigid antiseptic precautions
adopted,

In our former paper, we mentioned the fact that we had examined the blood from
several cases of General Paralysis. The blood was removed by venesection as a
remedial measure during seizures, and gave both the chemical and physiological tests
for choline which we have already described.

We have also describedt the results of examining in a similar way, the blood from
a case of Beri-beri. This is a tropical disease, which is accompanied by extensive
degenerative changes in nerves and muscles, and great vascular depression. A saline
solution of the residue from the alcoholic extract of the blood, produced on injection
a marked physiological result like that caused by a large dose of choline. The
amount of material at our disposal did not enable us to make a thorough chemical
examination of the blood. Using the platinum test we only obtained some ill-formed
