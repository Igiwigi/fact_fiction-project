-surface is the cubic ruled surface T.

4.6. Lastly there is the very well known H-system of quadries which have a quadric
surface and a point in common; and this system has been too much discussed else-
where to need any further remark here.

4.7. We have completed now the examination of all possible ®-surfaces, and we have
shown how to derive all the associated systems ® from certain associated systems of
curves A’ which we have obtained. This method carries with it a classification of all
the systems ® according to the type of their general ©-surface ; but it is not surprising
to find that such a classification, arising as it does from one particular method of genera-
tion of the systems ®, proves somewhat unsatisfactory from a more general point of view.
In fact some of the transformations in the various classes are obviously limiting cases of
more general transformations in other classes. For example most of those ®-systems
in which the quadrics touch a plane along a given line are limiting cases of others in
which the quadrics all contain a given conic. We shall therefore have to bear the faults
of the classification in mind in deciding what transformations are the most general.

We proceed now to an individual discussion of all the most general transformations
and of some specially interesting particular cases besides ; and we shall find the reverse
transformation in each case. In addition we shall illustrate the usefulness of the work
by deriving some geometrical facts of quite general interest.

Notation.—For purposes of reference we introduce a more systematic notation for
the transformations. We shall use the symbol {2, 7, n} to denote a quadric transforma-
