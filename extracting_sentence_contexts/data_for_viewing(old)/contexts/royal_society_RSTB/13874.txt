multi-locus approach [87], including a principal components
analysis of 92 population samples that showed three clear
clusters—labelled Oceanians, American Indians and Afri-
cans. The point being, as in Smouse and Spielman’s work,
that individual assignment to populations is possible using
multiple loci.

These same points first raised in the late 1970s would be
arrived at independently by Anthony Edwards in 2003, in his
impactful paper titled: ‘Human genetic diversity: Lewontin’s
fallacy’. Edwards argued that even with most of the variation
found within populations, genetics can be used for assign-
ment of individuals to genetic populations (a fact that had
just been shown empirically by [67]). Edwards developed
the point with an elegantly simple two-population math-
ematical model, and emphasized the information contained
in the joint distribution of all the observed loci. Scientifically,

his argument is similar to the points of Spielman and Smouse
and Mitton, but the presentation is more pithy and has
proven more impactful. Edwards was also the most polemi-
cal. He characterized Lewontin’s work as ‘an unjustified
assault on classification, which he deplored for social
reasons’.
