Figure 6. Mean shear stress time evolution per segment (in mPa). (aâ€”d) The periodic behaviour of the mean shear stress on
the wall holes of some drainage segments corresponding to Models 1-4, respectively. For the sake of a better visualization, only
the time evolution of the shear stress on the segments 1, 5 and 8 is shown; the shear stress evolution behaviour in the other
segments is similar.

in conditions when the ventricles are small or in the case where the catheters are placed in
close proximity to the ventricular wall. For this reason, it is also difficult to investigate different
volumes of CSF which might cause different flow forces and pulsatility to the VC lumen and
perforations. In these circumstances, particularly, it is important to mention the fact how precise
VCs should be placed in the middle of the ventricle without contact to adjacent tissue. This
situation is usually more difficult in cases with small ventricles compared those with large ones.
In this context, the results given in this study disclosed that sheer stress is magnified in proximal
catheter perforations compared with the more distal holes. We have shown in previous studies
that the amount of catheter perforations might be better limited in order to place the holes
exclusively inside the ventricle [29], which becomes more relevant in small ventricles. That might
lead us to theoretically optimal conditions to limit the catheter perforations only to the tip of
the catheter, thereby reducing the risk of perforations being close to the paraventricular tissue.
However, the limitation of the catheter perforations should take into account the total drainage
area (ie. the sum of the cross sections of all the perforations) in order to keep the shear stress
within an acceptable range. The difficulty of such an approach in daily neurosurgical practice was
discussed in [14].
