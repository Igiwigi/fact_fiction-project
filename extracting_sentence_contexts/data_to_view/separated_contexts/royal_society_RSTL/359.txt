history, there exists a necessity of strictly separating the facts
observed from the ideas which, in order to explain them, may
occur to the mind of the observer. In the present state of this

stock of real knowledge; when, on the contrary, the reasonings
weare enabled to make, are at best but ingenious guesses, which
too often bias and mislead the judgment. I shall therefore en-
