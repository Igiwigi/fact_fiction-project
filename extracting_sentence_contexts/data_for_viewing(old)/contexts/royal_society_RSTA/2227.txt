stabilizing (respectively, destabilizing) influence on the ring. Similarly for z; <0 if the
northern polar has strength I np < Fimax (respectively, I; np > Fmax) it has a stabilizing
(respectively, destabilizing) influence on the ring. This is in agreement with atmospherical
observations. For example, the case of polygonal zonal jets of potential vorticity present
in the Southern Hemisphere when the southern polar vortex is active, during the months
of July-August. In figure 7, we see an example of an hexagonal jet which occurred in
1998.

(b) Non-fixed polar vortices

As previously commented, this case has a system of a higher number of degrees of freedom with
respect to the case of fixed polar vortices and has been summarized in proposition 6.3. Due to the
fact that the Hessian now has non-diagonal terms we cannot fully diagonalize the Hamiltonian
as before using only the properties of circulant matrices. From proposition 6.3 and corollary 7.1,
by taking Tsp = —N-TI, np, We can immediately infer the following corollary to deduce stability
zones.


PV, 350 K, 15 July 1998 16 July 1998

Figure 7. An example of polygonal zonal jet of potential vorticity in the Earth’s atmosphere present when the southern polar
vortex is active during the months of July and August. The data shown are relative to 4 days observations during the period 15-18
of July of 1998. The hexagonal structure shown seems to be relatively stable during this period. The data are of potential vorticity
of the isoentrope surface 350K, calculated by using ERA-Interim (https://apps.ecmwf.int/datasets/data/interim-full-daily/
levtype=sfc/). Figure courtesy of Bernard Legras, LMD, ENS, Paris. (Online version in colour.)
