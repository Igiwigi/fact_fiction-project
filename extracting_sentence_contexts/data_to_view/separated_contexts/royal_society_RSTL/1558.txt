While Mr. Bropiz was tracing the thoracic duct, Mr. W1r-
LIAM BRANDE was making an infusion of the spleen, and
shewed me a section of it, in which the cells were larger, and
more distinct, than I had ever seen them in a dog. There
was a $light tinge of rhubarb in the infusion from the $pleen. A similar infusion was made of the liver ; but the quantity of
bloud contained in it being much greater than in the spleen,
the appearance was not sufficiently distinct to decide whether
it contained rhubarb or not, These experiments appear com-

pletely to establish the fact, that the rhubarb did not pass
through the thoracic duct, and therefore must have got into
the circulation of the blood by some other channel. They
likewise completely overturn the opinion T had adopted of
the spleen being the medium by which the rhubarb had been
conveyed, and show that the spleen answers some other pur-
poses in the animal economy. The rhubarb found in the spleen does not arrive there be-
fore it enters the circulation, it is therefore most probably after-=
wards deposited in the cells in the form of a secretion.
