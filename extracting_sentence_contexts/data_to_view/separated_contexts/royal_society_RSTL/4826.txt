in favour of this opinion—I may remark, that the extension of the yelk of the Frog's

egg in a direction transverse to the first cleavage, may also be advanced as conform-
able to the same view. It is further supported by the fact which I have seen in the
egg both of the Frog and Newts, that before the second or crucial cleavage is com-
menced the yelk becomes contracted, s0 that the first cleft for a time is almost imper-
ceptible while it is extended in the transverse direction, or line of axis of the first
division, after which the 8econd or crucial cleft is commenced. To this I may add
another fact which appears to be equally significant, and which occurs in the unim-
pregnated eggs both of the Frog and Newts, but more especially in the latter. Although no recedence of the yelk from the vitelline membrane takes place in the
unimpregnated egg of the Frog, it becomes, nevertheless, slightly oval after the first
few hours, but returns to its original shape some time afterwards.
