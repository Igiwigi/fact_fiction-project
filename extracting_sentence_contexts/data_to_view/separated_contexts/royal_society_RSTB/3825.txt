As we shall see, this line of inquiry has not previously been

productive or so-called grey measures, and I have not concerned myself with the red
rocks of the so-called ‘‘ Lower Permian,’ which there is some reason to believe are of

are strictly limited. As the result of several weeks’ work during the last three
years, I have managed to obtain a fairly representative collection of fossil plants
from different parts of the Forest, and these will be found described here. In part
