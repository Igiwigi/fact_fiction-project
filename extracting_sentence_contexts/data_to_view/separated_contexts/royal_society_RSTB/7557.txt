Hence it is at present impossible to say
at what temperature migration would start without the aid of mutual stimulation. Possibly
the required temperature would be higher than for swarm migration. But the fact remains
that Volkonsky (1939) found that the threshold body temperature for mass taking-off by
locusts in a large cage varied between 31 and 37° C, and Gunn et al. (1948) found that the
highest body temperatures recorded at stream-away in the field varied between 27 and
41°C on different occasions. That is to say the start of mass migration often occurs
when the locusts’ body temperatures are well within Hussein’s range for normal activity. Waloff’s (1946) finding that the flight activity of Desert Locust swarms in East Africa
remained at a high level as long as the average maximum temperature was above 20 to 22° C
