Fia. 12.—Tadpoles of Ascidiella aspersa. A., recently hatched ; B., tadpole 10 days old, with functional
heart, outgrowth of ampulle and generally advanced differentiation of body, characteristic of tadpoles
developing in hyper-alkaline sea-water or from physiologically old eggs; C., metamorphosed and

in some degree acclimatised, and the absolute acidity would be less effective than an
increase in acidity. ‘'adpoles transferred from water of a low pH to water of a high
pH would find the production of an intercellular acidity by muscle contraction extremely
difficult, while the fact that tadpoles which have developed throughout in water of a
high pH have the same retardation of phagocytosis implies that there is a critical pH
above which phagocytosis is more or less inhibited. It should be noted that in typical tadpoles that have existed as such for a few hours
only, phagocytosis of the tail commences at the tip and progresses towards the base
until all the tissue has been stored within the trunk. This progression may be due to
