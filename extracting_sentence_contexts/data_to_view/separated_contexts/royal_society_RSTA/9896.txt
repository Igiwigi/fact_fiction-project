Also, looking at 2783, which is the
Pwest of the seven, we notice that it contains the least percentage of B,O;, but not
fhe highest percentage of K,O. This suggests that B,O, is more efficient in raising
&, than K,O in lowering it. That the effect of B,O; must be predominant is other-
Wise evident from the fact that the order of the percentages of B,O, is the same as
fhe order of magnitude of C,, with one exception (1809).

§ The last column of Table VI. shows the values of (percentage of B,O;)—3 (percentage

@ K,O). This places 1809 in the sequence, but throws out 3749. Also the marked

Alifference between the four first and the three last is shown very clearly.

3 The glasses do not form a sufficiently regular series to enable us to go further and
determine exactly the law of dependence of C, upon the percentages of B,O; and

"gf K,O in the glass.
