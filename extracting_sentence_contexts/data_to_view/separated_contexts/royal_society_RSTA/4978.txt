In the case of opaque media, a peculiarity of this analysis, as compared with that
of yon Hetmuorrz* and others, is that the conduction current is derived from the
electric displacement by the inverse operator k (md/dt + o’)~! instead of a direct
rator involving a coefficient of conductivity in place of the coefticient of resist-
ance o’. Notwithstanding that there are as many as four adjustable constants, it is
= to some extent, to crucially compare the resulting formula for K’ with the
‘experimental facts for metallic media. It is known that the broad type of formal
Btheory which simply assigns to the metals a complex index of refraction K" is con-
firmed by the general agreement between results deduced trom calculations relating
Bio reflexion experiments by Brrr, Vorar, Drupe and others, and those obtained
aetly from deviation experiments with thin metallic prisms by Kunpv.t
