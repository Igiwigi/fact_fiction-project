For example, time slice F-G compares the change first millennium AD. p-significant plots starting at slice G-H
in growth rates between 550-450 BC (block F) and 450-350 (400-300 BC) arguably signal the beginning of an Arawakan
BC (block G). For ease of writing, we employ the median expansion, while p-significant areas in J-K and K-L may be
dates of each set of blocks when reporting change over time, further fluorescence of this phenomenon (electronic sup-

i.e. we refer to time slice F-G simply as 500-400 BC. plementary material, figure S1). The fact that, in aggregate,


our demographic signal never overshoots the expectations epitomizes the expansion of both Arauquinoid/Incised-Punc-

of the logistic model can be interpreted as empirical evidence tuate ceramic complexes (which are often associated with
that populations never exceeded carrying capacity. We argue Carib languages) and pottery of the Amazonian Polychrome
that this better supports a ‘pull’ model of population expansion tradition (which in western Amazonia can be associated
[43], one characterized by ‘budding off’ of splinter groups, with Tupi-Guarani languages): both reach their apogee early
than a ‘push’ model of Arawakan expansion, the latter during the second millennium AD. That population growth
instigated by population pressure under scarce landed in the Madeira region accelerates earlier than the middle
resources [15].
