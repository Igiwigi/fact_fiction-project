angelegt werden, die sich schon sehr bald einkerbt und so jene vermeintlichen
Papillen. entstehen liisst, oder ob sie als wirklich Papillen hervorsprossen, ist
schwer zu entscheiden.” Werner (104, fig. 2, p. 450) shows, in a young Dreis-
sensia, separate gill filaments at the back part of the gill, while the extremities of
the anterior filaments are united in series. He does not say, however, how this
condition is arrived at. Murrsennermer, quite recently (56, p. 58) also admits the
difficulty in deciding the exact mode of the origin of the gills of Dreissensia ; but he
confesses that he did not specially investigate this point It is not possible to draw
one’s own conclusions from his figures (figs. 56-59).

In view, therefore, of the uncertainty that exists as to the exact details of the
development of the gills of the commonest and most investigated species; and
secondly, of the fact that Drew (22) has shown that the gill leaflets of Nucula
develop as papillee which later become flattened out; and thirdly, of the fact that the
Protobranchia are almost universally admitted to be the most archaic representatives
of the Lamellibranchiate Mollusea,* we may, pending further investigations specially
directed to this object, conclude that the perforation or the slitting into filaments of
a continuous gill-membrane is an infraction of the rule that ontogeny is a repetition
of phylogeny.

Labial Palps.

It is of no little interest to observe that throughout the wide range of the
Lamellibranchia the palps do not share in the remarkable diversity of structure
which the ctenidia exhibit. A minute examination of the palps was not made in
