The same again holds good for (¢) of
§ 8. It is because of their suggestiveness that they are here included. That a
differential fertility -or an individualisation in the sex of offspring should be corre-
lated with colour, would, if proved, be a fact of very considerable interest. It would
again emphasise the important part which genetic selection plays in the modification of
characters.* 4 priori it is not more unreasonable to expect coat-colour in horses than
to suppose hair-colour in men to be correlated with fertility. But the fertility of man
does seem to vary from the light to the dark races.
