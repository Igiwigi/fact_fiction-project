Another very
important consideration is that the SFX method at XFELs is a single-shot technique, and that
each crystal is fresh and not previously exposed. This removes the accumulating background
differences as well as fall-off of intensity and resolution that would be caused by repeated laser
excitation and X-ray exposure of the same crystal volume. Interestingly, the increased sensitivity
to light-induced differences using the SFX method was in fact not readily predicted before the
first convincing demonstrations for a number of reasons. Firstly, pump-induced structure factor
amplitude differences AF are typically smaller than noise particularly with ultrafast excitation,
such that the inverse Fourier transform after appropriate phasing of the data accumulates electron
density differences to statistically significant levels in real space in well-correlated cases. The
level of correlation between repeated measurements is increased by the lack of background from
damage, but may be increased by inhomogeneity of crystal size and the level of isomorphicity.
