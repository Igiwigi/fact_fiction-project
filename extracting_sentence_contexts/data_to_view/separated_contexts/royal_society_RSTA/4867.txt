Lemma 8.2. The cohomology group He (AZ [1/A],F) vanishes, but the weight 3 part of
Pp
He (AZ [1/A], F) is one-dimensional, and Froby, acts on it as gi.

Proof. The vanishing of the H# is the fact that My, =0. By the Lefschetz trace formula, M1,9(Fq)

is (1/(q(q — 1)) times the two term sum
1 1
—Trace(Frobs, |H? (43, [x] F) + Trace(Frobg, |H2 (23, [x] iP). From our estimate that M1 ,9(F,) = —1/,/q + O(1/q), we see that this sum is —q>/? + O(q).
