In
cords in which the crossed pyramidal tract comes to form a large portion of the
lateral column, it would seem that with the growth of the tract the shallow bay
containing tissue continuous with the sub-pial membrane becomes, so to say, unfolded
and more shallow, even to disappearance. But a septum thrusting itself into the
lateral column at the spot records the site of its existence. That the septum is of
real morphological significance, I believe, from the fact that it divides from one
another two masses of nerve-fibres, which offer a strong contrast in their appearance. On the dorsal aspect of the septum lie coarse fibres of fairly equable size (cerebellar) ;
on the ventral exists an admixture composed largely of fine fibres (ascending antero-
lateral). In the Monkey, in which animal, as I have indicated,* a portion of the
pyramidal tract lies outside the cerebellar along the surface of the lateral column,
the fibres of the pyramidal tract, as marked out by the degeneration method,
generally, when followed along the surface in the ventral direction, cease abruptly at
the little septum in question.
