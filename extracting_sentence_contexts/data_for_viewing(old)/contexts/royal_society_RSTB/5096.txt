process from the stapes, representing the lower part of the hyomandibular.

The living reptiles exhibit a curious four-rayed columellar apparatus, one leg
passing inward to the fenestra, the opposite one to the tympanic membrane, a third
goes downward to the hyoid, and the fourth is attached to the end of the paroccipital
process—that is, it occupies the position held by the head of the hyomandibular in
Osteolepis. I believe the process to have been present in Embolomeri, and that both
it and the foot plate of the stapes represent the original head of the hyomandibular
divided into two by an enlargement and migration upward of the hyomandibular
foramen, the inner of the limbs so formed migrating downwards over the jugular
canal to its final position.

The fact that a tympanic membrane connected to the otic region by a stapes can
be formed before the formation of ‘a fenestra ovalis is an astonishing one, perhaps
most readily understood if it originally took place in water, where the amount of energy
which can be conveyed by sound waves of reasonable amplitude is greater than in
air.

We have thus seen that in some cases, at any rate, the mode by which the changes
necessary to convert a fish into Amphibian took place was such as to demand little

modification of function of any part of the animal, and to avoid the necessity of any
sudden reconstruction of the nervous mechanism which controlled its activities.

Furthermore, the transformation as a whole is built up by the modification of many
