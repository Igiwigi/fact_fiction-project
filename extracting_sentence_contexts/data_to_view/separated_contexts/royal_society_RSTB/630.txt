Of course, some of these degenerated fibres are fibres on their way to form these two
tracts, as I have previously shown; but the great bulk are short ascending internun-
cial fibres. So far, I have only dealt with the experimental side of the question. I have still
to give a brief résumé of the more important facts which clinical practice and patho-
logical examination afford. On the experimental side, we have little difficulty in exactly localizing the lesion,
and the fallacies arise when we come to test the results of it, for nothing is more diffi-
cult than to test the different forms of sensibility in animals. This objection, however,
which is always raised by purely clinical observers, is not so great in the Monkey as
in the Dog, as I think the results of my experiments show.
