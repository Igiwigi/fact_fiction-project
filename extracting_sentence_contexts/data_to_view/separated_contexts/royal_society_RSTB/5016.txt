The perfect
sacrum of Eogyrinus shows that these ilia rested on long sacral ribs, exactly as does
a scapula on those of the thorax, and was attached to these by muscles. There is less

complete evidence of a similar structure even in the terrestrial Diplovertebron. Thus, as in the case of the respiratory movements, locomotion in the most primitive
Amphibia is carried on by a series of muscular movements carried out by the same
structures and with the same rhythm as in the fish ancestors, the first tetrapods in
fact swam upon land. But once the terrestrial habit was established, evolutionary
changes take place in the limbs and limb girdles which, unlike those which we have
already considered, have directly adaptive results, and alter their direction with modifi-
cation of the habits of life. On one other important element in the story of the conversion of a fish into a Tetrapod,
some light is thrown by the structure of the Embolomeri.
