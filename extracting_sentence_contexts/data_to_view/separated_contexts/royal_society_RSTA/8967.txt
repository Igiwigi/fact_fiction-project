Tables XX. to XXIII.* give steps in the
necessary computations, and figs. 5 to 12 show the results plotted against 6 from 0°
to 150°. These curves show that for this range the first approximation is very good
for Z,, Z,. In fact, the curves for &, & were easily drawn and gave interpolated values
of Z,, Z, to three places of decimals, the last figure being approximate. The functions
m,n, have a greater number of oscillations and greater amplitudes, and there was in
places some little doubt as to the exact forms of the curves. By careful examination
and comparison of corresponding curves for the two cases of xa =9 and 10, this
difficulty was overcome.
