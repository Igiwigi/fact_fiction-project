On cutting fresh surfaces it was found that the actual amount escaping and the amount
calculated from the rate of flow were nearly identical. Thus in a particular case (pear) the amount escaping was 14°4 cub. centims. per
hour, with a rate of flow of 128 centims. per hour. ‘The total internal area of cross-
section of the vessels being 0°106 sq. centim.; this gave a calculated amount of flow
through them of 13°6 cub, centims. per hour. In another case (apple) the observed
and calculated rates were 11°2 and 10°83 cub. centims. ; the difference being probably
due to the fact that a little of the water passes through the tracheides and walls of
the wood vessels. Full proof that in the absence of air the flow takes place in
accordance with definite physical laws was obtained by selecting straight young stems
bare of lateral branches for lengths of 10-25 centims., and saturating the stems fully
with water under pressure. The stems used remained living for some weeks after-
wards, Clean surfaces were then cut, water driven through, and the theoretical and
actual amounts of flow compared.
