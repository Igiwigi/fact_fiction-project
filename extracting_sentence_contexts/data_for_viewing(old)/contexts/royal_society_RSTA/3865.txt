We have already stated that laser cavity modes in the focal plane are analogous to two-
dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator eigenfunctions. In fact, the HG modes (1.1) are exactly
two-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator eigenstates (albeit with the convention that the
usual width of a quantum oscillator w= wo/V2 for wo the optical focal beam waist); as in
the previous section, we set our constants to be dimensionless, and the appropriate choice is


w=1,wo =1/V2. Having introduced the classical Hamiltonian formalism in the previous section,
we can observe that the wave mechanics picture (i.e. ‘quantum mechanics’) comes purely from
canonical quantization, where observables H,L,M and M become operators on wave functions,
and in configuration space, p > p = —i(dx, dy) (in our optical wave mechanics, we have no h). We
defer the meaning of the quantization procedure (and, indeed, the significance to Gaussian beams
of the classical harmonic oscillator) until later—the fact that HG and LG modes are eigenstates
of the two-dimensional quantum isotropic harmonic oscillator should be sufficient motivation to
continue for now.?

The two-dimensional harmonic oscillator is separable in Cartesian coordinates, as the quantum
Hamiltonian H = 1eP+A) ) commutes with the Hamiltonian in x, Ay = 3(P2 + @). Therefore,
there are eigenfunctions of H which factorize into functions of x and y (each one-dimensional
harmonic oscillator eigenfunctions), and of course these are the HG modes, for which (with our :
choice of dimensionless constants) AyHGin = (m+ )HGnin, AyHGin =(n+ 3)HGnn. Thus, [=

AG = (Ay + Ay)HG pm = (1 +11 + 1G = (N + HG, 3

so the mode order N corresponds to the quantum harmonic oscillator’s principal quantum ae
