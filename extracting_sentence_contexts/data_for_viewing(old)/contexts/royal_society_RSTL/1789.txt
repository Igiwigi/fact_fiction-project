hour; the thermometer at the diaphragm was 872; in the pelvis 83*; but the
animal was now less lively.

« Having been put into its cage, the thermometer being placed at the dia-
phragm, in two hours afterwards, was at 93* *,”

In these experiments the animals appear to have been roused partly by the
state of the wound in the abdomen, but chiefly by the extreme cold. They
can scarcely, however, be considered as experiments upon hybernation, how-
ever interesting they may be in reference to reviviscence from that state.

The fact of the fatal influence of excited respiration during the augmented
irritability of hybernation, contrasted with the similar fatal effect of suspended
respiration, during the diminished irritability of the state of activity, will
illustrate many of the causes, kinds, and phenomena of death. Do not these
resolye themselyes, in fact, into irritability insufficiently or excessively excited ?

Recapitulation.

The object of this paper has been to treat of the singular phenomena of hy-
bernation, and especially to point out the remarkable application of the law
slated in my former paper, to the active and lethargic states of the hybernating
animal.
