But it is possible that these are unfertilised ovules, though they have
attained the length and diameter of a ripe seed, and it is also probable that figs. 6
and 7 represent normal conditions of the ovule at different stages. However, this is
only a supposition, suggested by the fact that the condition represented by fig. 9
occurs in almost fully developed infrutescences of two different species. Opposed
to this is the fact that the embryo is not differentiated until late in the development
of the infrutescence. Now, whatever the shape of the ovular body be, the two opposed, more or less
equally developed lobes are present, and a vascular strand runs from the attachment
of the ovule, at the base of the cell up and into one of these lobes ; and in this lobe
the embryo is formed. The question arises, what is the nature and function of the
rest of the body?
