When generated in different ways, the action of the Same
gas would sometimes prove itself 80 discordant as to suggest to me the Pos8ible
existence of novel allotropic conditions to account for snch variations of behaviour,
Two samples, moreover, of nominally the same liquid, would furnish vapours yielding
results far too divergent to be tolerated. The drying apparatus also contributed its
quota of disturbance. These anomalies were finally traced to the fact that an
incredibly small amount of impurity derived from the stronger gages or vapours
sufficed to disguise and falsify the action of the weaker ones. All this had to be
learnt ; and when learnt, I thought it desirable, for the sake of accuracy, not to
publish the results which had been gained with s0 much labour, but to go once
more, with improved appliances, over the same ground. This I did ; though it
involved the total abandonment of seven weeks' uninterrupted experimental work
in 1859, of seven weeks' similar work in 1860, and of many fragmentary eftorts, On
the 10th of January, 1861, the memoir containing an account.
