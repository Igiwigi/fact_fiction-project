different experiments; particularly so, as the analysis of every
part of the animal body, except the bones, is at present 80 in-
complete; but I hope that the time necessary for my medical
pursuits, and the want of a complete chemical apparatus, will
not render the simple facts I have here related less useful.

I have not attempted to account for the various phenomena
which appear in the experiments, because the facts seem too
few to admit of any general conclusion.

If the above experiments should appear to the Society worthy
of their attention, the application of my former experiments,
and the results of ome which I hope to make, on some ani-
mals that are placed under different circumstances favourable
> to their decomposition, shall be the basis of a future paper.
