In this case there
is after-effect in the positive direction, 7.e., a retinal discharge in the same direction
as the exciting current. With a normal fresh eyeball giving the regular positive response to illumination
this retinal discharge is in the positive or upward direction, whether the exciting
current be directed upwards or downwards. This is the principal and most certainly
demonstrable fact. At later stages and with moribund eye-balls the effects become
variable. We-may then witness retinal discharge upward in response to upward
excitation, and downward in response to downward excitation, and finally I have
once or twice obtained a downward retinal discharge in response to both
directions of excitation. .
