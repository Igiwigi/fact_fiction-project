These conclusions are confirmed by other choices of the state on the environment. For instance,
we plot again the DFs for the choices Cy,1 (figure 2a,c) and C,,2 (figure 2b,d) and for the same choice
of the parameters as in figure 1, while the state of the environment is chosen different, because we
take now N; = Np = 1. We see that there is no particular difference between the two DFs nj(t) and
np(t) (this is possibly due to the fact that Nj = Nz). However, adding the phases to the a) creates,
again, a lot of noise in the DM process, noise which disappears, but only after a sufficiently long
time. It is useful to stress that, changing further the parameters of the Hamiltonian, does not really
affect our conclusions.
