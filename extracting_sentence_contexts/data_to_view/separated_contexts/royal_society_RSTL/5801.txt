ine drawn from the top to the bottom would rarely exceed 459, and in some parts would

Seven lava-currents which were noticed by the Canon RecuytRo in his *© Storia Natu-
ale dell Etna,” and to which the traveller BrxyDoxz called attention in England, by
ating in one of his © Letters on the two Sicilies,' that REcuPERo had been able by the
Aid of these lavas, * to assign a higher antiquity to Mount Etna than had heretofore
Sbeen ascribed to our planet itself.” Dr. CarLo GEMMELLARO assures me that he has

Seven different levels there intervene, between successive currents of laya, red layers
either of burnt tuff or of decomposed scoriaceous crusts of lava-currents, which have

Amyself in one vertical section at the Scalazza, a spot of which I shall presently have
more to 8ay. They reminded me precisely of the red clays and tuffs which abound
in the Island of Madeira, where many subacrial lavas have overflowed the surface in
8uccession, and where there have been sufficient intervals of time between 8uccessive
eruptions for the decomposition into clay of the crust of each preexisting lava, or where
* volcanic s8and has been showered down from above or washed over the older lava by
torrents and floods.
