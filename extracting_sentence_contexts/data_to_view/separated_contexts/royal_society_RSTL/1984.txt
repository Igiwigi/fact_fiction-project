vius”; but what is moſt extraordinary (as there was but
little wind during the eruption of the eighth of Auguſt)
minute aſhes fell thick that very night upon the town of
Manfredonia, which is at the diftance of -an hundred
miles from Veſuvius #,

Theſe facts ſeem to confirm the extreme ſuppoſed
height of the column of fire that iſſued from the crater
of Veſuvius laſt Sunday night, and are greatly in ſupport
of what we find recorded in the hiſtory of Veſuvius with
| reſpect to the fall of its aſhes at an amazing diſtance, and
in a ſhort ſpace of time, during its violent eruptions. We procezeded from Caccia-bella to Ottaiano, which
is-a mile nearer to Veſuvius, and is reckoned to contain
twelve thouſand inhabitants. - Nothing could be more
diſmal than the fight of this town, unroofed, half buried

(p) The prince of Monte Mileto told me, that his ſon, the Duke of Popoli,
who was at Monte Mileto the 8th of Auguſt, had been alarmed by the ſhower
of cinders that fel} there, ſome of which he had ſent to Naples, weighing two
ounces; and that ſtones of an ounce had fallen upon an eſtate of his ten miles
farther off, Monte Mileto is about thirty miles from the volcano,

(4) The Abbe 6ALtaxi, well known in the literary world, told me, that
his fiſter, a nun in a Convent at Manfredonia, had wrote to enquire after him,
imagining that Naples muft haye been deſtroyed, when they, at ſo great a dif-
tance, had been ſo much alarmed by a ſhower of minute aſhes, which fell on
that city at eleyen o'clock at night, the 8th of Auguſt, as to open all the
churches, and go to prayers.
