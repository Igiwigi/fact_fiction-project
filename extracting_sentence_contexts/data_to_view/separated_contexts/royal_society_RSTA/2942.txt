The difference between these two quantities E — Ey
is similarly a positive quantity determined by the variance in the real and imaginary components
of the wavelet among the various occultations. Hence Ey must have a value between 0 and E. In fact, Eg can only equal E when 4; — ¢; is the same for all occultations, as would be the case
if the opacity variations are entirely due to a single wave with the specified pattern speed and
m-number. For any other signal, Ey will be less than E because of the finite scatter in 9; — i. Indeed, as N approaches infinity, Ey, should approach zero for these signals (provided we can
sample all possible values of #; — ¢;).
