The use of the first form is justified if we believe that in the populations sampled there
are different standard deviations, o, and o,; while if o, = c, the second form should
be taken. The hypothesis concerning the two means has not, in fact, always to be
tested under the same conditions, and which form of the criterion is most appropriate
is a matter for judgment based upon the evidence available regarding those conditions. The role of sound judgment in statistical analysis is of great importance and in a
large number of problems common sense may alone suffice to determine the appropriate
method of attack. But there is ample evidence to show that this has not and cannot
always be enough, and that it is therefore essential that the ideas involved in the
process of testing hypotheses should be more clearly understood.
