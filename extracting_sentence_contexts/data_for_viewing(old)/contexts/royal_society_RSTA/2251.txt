is usually a fast, high-frequency process [29,37,49]. The energies usually oscillate in time and
practically reach equilibrium values at times of order of ten periods of atomic vibrations.
Characteristic frequency of these oscillations is of order of /c/M. It was shown that the
oscillations in graphene contain very low frequency of order of 10~?./c7M.

In the present paper, spatially uniform distribution of kinetic energy (or kinetic temperature)
was considered. In the case of non-uniform initial temperature profile, an additional physical
process, notably the ballistic heat transport, should be considered. The heat transport is much
slower than equilibration of energies considered above [30,50-54]. Therefore, at short times
behaviour of kinetic energy at each spatial point can be approximately described by formula (6.5).
It was shown that in a spatially uniform case, if initial kinetic energies, corresponding to degrees
of freedom of the unit cell, are equal then their equilibrium values are also equal. Note that this
fact does not guarantee that kinetic energies will remain equal during heat transport. In particular,
in paper [11], it was shown that in heat-conducting harmonic crystals the kinetic energies are
generally different even if their initial values are equal.

In the present paper, anharmonic effects were neglected. In paper [29], it is shown numerically
that anharmonicity of interatomic interactions causes an additional relaxation process. This
process leads, in particular, to equipartition of kinetic energies, corresponding to different
degrees of freedom. However, at least in the case of small anharmonicity, the relaxation process
is much slower than processes described above. Therefore, we believe that at short times
harmonic approximation has reasonable accuracy. Investigation of anharmonic effects would be
an interesting extension of the present work.

Thus presented results may serve for better understanding of thermal equilibration and
