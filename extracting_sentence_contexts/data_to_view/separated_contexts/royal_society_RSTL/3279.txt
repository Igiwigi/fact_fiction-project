The first. condition is satisfied by
grooving the polisher, provided the resinous surface is sufliciently soft to expand late-
rally into the grooves when necessary ; but when it is 80, I have not found it hard
enough to give a very true surface, and therefore the second condition is not satisfied. But here it is necessary to explain the meaning which I attach to the words true
surface, in contradistinction to accurate general, figure. A true surface is one which
observyes the law of continuity, when, in fact, the normal to the surface everywhere
cuts the axis in conformity to the law of the curve, whatever that may be. In prac-
tice, the defect, which I call an untrue surface, is perceptible at a glance where it is
very considerable, and the speculum is of long focus, for instance, twenty-seven feet ;
it is then only necessary to Place the eye a few inches within the focus, while the spe-
culum is turned to some bright object, as for instance the enamelled dial-plate of a
watch, or the moon. The irregularity of the whole surface will then -be apparent,
more at the joints where the speculum is in separate pieces, but still more where
there is a flaw or crack.
