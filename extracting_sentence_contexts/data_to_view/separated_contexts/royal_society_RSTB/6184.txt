No further details of this case are given, and evidently no strain showing hernia
without crest has been produced from this bird, as could have been done if she
really contained the gene for hernia without that for crest. Without such con-
firmation this single example remains inconclusive. That the authors were also
influenced in their conclusion by the belief that their data showed that crest was
not closely linked with pile, or “ dominant white,” is shown by the following further
comment :—

“The possibility of a close linkage between the two genes is made improbable by
the fact that, although hernia is very closely linked with the recessive allelo-
morph of dominant white, crest appeared in our previous data to be inde-
pendent of this colour gene.” It has, however, already been shown above that the data for crest and colour are
entirely consistent with very close linkage between these factors. The identification of the genes postulated for crest and hernia establishes and
simplifies an interesting linkage-group in poultry recently proposed by Hurt.
