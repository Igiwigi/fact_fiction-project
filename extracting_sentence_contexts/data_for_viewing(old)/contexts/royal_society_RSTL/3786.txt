ferable to a spiral mode of origin, similar to that producing the fasciculus of filaments
in the clot fig. 1483. And the formation of spirals out of discs in the clot of blood re-
sembles in a striking manner that described in the foregoing memoir, as witnessed in
the formation of certain tissues : for instance, nerve and muscle, TI have just men-
tioned the reproduction of filaments by self-division (fig. 148 y, 5) as noticed in the
clot : a process obviously the same as that described in the memoir as obseryed in
the tissues. But the analogy does not end here. In a former communication I
figured blood-corpuscles (cells) from which the contents, except the nucleus, had been
removed by acetic acid. If those figures be referred to, it will be found that the
nucleus s0 remaining is in many instances double. An examination of coagulating
blood enables me now to offer some explanation of this curious fact.

99. In fig. 150 is sketched a blood-corpuscle (cell) presenting a coiled filament, «.
This coil having arisen out of the nucleus of the corpuscle or cell, the residual por-
tion of the nucleus becaine double by self-division : and then each half of the nucleus
formed a coil, s0 that an outer coil contained two smaller coils (Þ, 3), each having a
pellucid centre for future change. We here again find a process in operation, bear-
ing a striking resemblance to that producing tissues.—Compare with fig. 147,

100. Where the supply of nutriment goes on, this process of self-division, and the
formation of new solid substance, are continued until an entire tissue is produced.
Where that supply is s00n exhausted, as in coagulating blood, the process in question
is speedily at an end. But here also, as in the tissues, greater firmness is acquired as
