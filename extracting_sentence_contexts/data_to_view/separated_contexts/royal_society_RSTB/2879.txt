After death in such a case there will be no intravascular clotting found. Again, Wau (3) pointed out years ago that if Daboia venom is heated for a short
time to 100 F. its action appears to be altered, the primary convulsions no longer
appearing, but a gradual failure of respiration occurs terminating in respiratory
convulsions of a secondary nature, much as in many cases of poisoning by the venom
of the Rattlesnake. The above references sutlice to show what different opinions
have been held as to the action of the Daboia venom, while the whole of the known
facts appear to be difficult to satisfactorily explain on any hypothesis yet put forward. In order to try und throw some light on the question I have taken simultaneous
tracings of the respirations and blood pressure curves with interesting and
instructive results. Blood Pressure and Respiratory Curves.
