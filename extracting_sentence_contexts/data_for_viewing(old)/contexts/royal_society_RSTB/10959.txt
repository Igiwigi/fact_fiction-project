exist in a number of different mammalian cell types, but
always exclusively within female cells [11,12]. A decade
passed before Ohno & Hauschka [13] deduced that only
one of the two X chromosomes exhibited the particular struc-
ture. This led Mary Lyon to hypothesize shortly thereafter
that the distinctive structure of the Barr body was related to
its function, or rather lack thereof, in that it was a manifes-
tation of an inactivated X chromosome with respect to
expression, with its homologue being in a transcriptionally
active state (Xa) [1,13].

Ohno & Hauschka [13] speculated that the Barr bodyâ€™s
singular structure possibly reflected the fact that it was
more compact than its homologue. However, it was unclear
whether this perceived compactness of the Xi relative to the
Xa, and to all autosomes, was due to the former having a
reduced volume relative to the latter, or whether this
impression was simply due to differences in their relative
shapes, surface areas and chromatin character [9]. A series
of studies emanating from the laboratory of the Cremer
brothers led efforts to clarify this question. Three-dimensional
confocal fluorescence microscopy performed on female
cells sourced from amniotic fluid showed that, in terms of
volume, the Xa was not substantially larger than the Xi
(approx. 1.2x) [14]. The authors noted that this ratio fell
