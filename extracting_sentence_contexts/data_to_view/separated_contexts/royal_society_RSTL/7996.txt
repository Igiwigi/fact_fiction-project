Hence the proposition is proved.

26. The quantities x, y, 2, w of the last article are evidently proportional to the tetra-
hedral coordinates of the point «, 3, y, 3, referred to the tetrahedron whose vertices are
the poles of the planes A, B, C, D of the quadrics S—A?, S—B?, S—=C?, S—TY, 80 that
the equation of condition in #, y, 2, w is only the equation of the surface F referred to
this tetrahedron. Hence the method of generation of surfaces of the fourth degree
having a conic for a nodal line is exactly the same as the method of generating cyclides
given in art. 5; and in fact the two surfaces are identical, since the cyclide has the
imaginary circle at infinity for a nodal line, s0 that by linear transformation we could
get one surface from the other; and to eyery property of a cyclide there is a corresponding
property of the more general surface here considered: but I thought that it would be
useful to show that their equations, the equations of the surface cutting them ortho-
gonally &c., are identical in form; 80 that for every theorem which I shall prove to hold
for a cyclide the reader may if he chooses put in the more general surface here con-
8idered#.

#* [Professor Carrey has remarked to me that, instead of the method of Chapter IT., the immediate general-
ization would be to consider, instead of spheres, quadric surfaces of the form $+LM, S+LN, &e., and that it is
a further generalization, or rather an extension, of S—A?, S—B?, &e, Professor CarLey remarks that itis a pity
to omit tho intermediate step. Before Professor Carry had drawn my attention to it, the intermediate step had
not occurred to me; however, any, person who reads Chapter IT. will find it easy to supply, by the assistance of
the two following propoxitions, the omissions referred to:—

I. $+LM=0, $+LN=0 aro two quadries; it is required to find the condition that the pole of L with respect
to $+IM will he the pole of M—N with respect to $+LN, Let

8+IM=a*+j*+22+u?+2(by +ez +dw Yo,
S+IN =@ +1 +2 +w*+2(Vy +: +dw)z;

and let A, p, y, c be the coordinates of the pole of the plane & with respect to the quadric S+LM=0; then we
get the four equations:
A+bp+o0 +dg=1, aAb+p=0,
ac+y =0, Ad+g=0. DR.
