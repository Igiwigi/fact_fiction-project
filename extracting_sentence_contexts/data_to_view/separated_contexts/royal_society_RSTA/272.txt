MINIMAL INDICES OF COLUMN DEPENDENCE

17. The method of reflexion can now be applied to any stratum S, and it will give
all information about the singular form N as well as the original form L. In fact let D
meet S in the space §,,, an [e+v—1], and therefore admit a certain nest of spaces
(S,,) through successive reflexions

Assume one or more ¥/, to occur, else no new feature arises. Since D will now meet each
stratum, we can take S$ to be the stratum C (x — 0) without loss of generality.
