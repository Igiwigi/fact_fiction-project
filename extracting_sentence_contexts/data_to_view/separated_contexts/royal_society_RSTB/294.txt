The comparisons which have been made will, I think, make it clear that the
Pterosaurian skull, as shown in Scaphognathus Purdont, has a very close affinity to
the skulls of Lacertilia in important points of structure, while the resemblances to
the Avian skull are only superficial, On the other hand, the brain of S. Purdoni
departs from the Reptilian type, and makes an approach towards the brain of Birds,
and more especially to the form found in the fossil Hesperornis and its allies. Accep-
ting these facts, about which there can be no doubt, the Pterosauria show close
affinities with both Birds and Reptiles. From an evolutionistâ€™s point of view, this
seems to be just what would be expected; and one is inclined to say at once, Here
is the link connecting the two Sauropsidan groups. If Birds are modified and more
highly developed Reptiles, the Pterodactyl was surely the intermediate stage, or, in
other words, the Pterodactyl was the direct ancestor of the Bird.
