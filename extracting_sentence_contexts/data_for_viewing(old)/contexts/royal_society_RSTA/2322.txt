the past few years [21-24]; of these, the Contextuality-by-Default approach [24] also emphasizes
applications of contextuality beyond quantum theory. However, this approach is focused on
probabilistic models. By encompassing a wider range of models, notably possibilistic ones, the
sheaf-theoretic approach allows a much larger class of examples to be recognized as exhibiting
contextuality.

(b) Outline

We begin, in ยง2, by introducing valuation algebras, inference problems and a few key examples.
In ยง3, we introduce a general definition of disagreement and discuss many instances of local
agreement and global disagreement. Section 4 reviews the sheaf-theoretic definition of non-
locality and contextuality, and presents the connection with disagreement. In ยง5, we show that,
in many relevant valuation algebras, detecting disagreement is in fact an inference problem,
and introduce the concept of complete disagreement. Section 6 deals with the connection
between disagreement and logical forms of contextuality. Finally, we discuss future research paths
in ยง7.

2. Valuation algebras and generic inference

(a) Basic definitions

We begin by reviewing the language of valuation algebras. In the simplest terms, a valuation
algebra is a set of pieces of information, or valuations, concerning some variables. Each valuation
carries information about a subset of the variables, called its domain. Valuations can be combined
together to obtain joint information, or projected to focus the available information on specific
