The boiling-point of dimethylated acetone is 93%5 C. Frov states that ethyl acetone
boils between 90* and 95% , The only discrepancy between the two compounds is in
their specific grayities, which are as follow :—
Dimethylated acetone - ©8099 at 13*®C.
Ethyl acetone 11 401. |, (oo £842) at 1990;

This discrepancy may perhaps be explained by the fact that Frev1G's ketone yielded
on analysis 0-6 per cent. too much carbon, and 0-4 per cent. too little hydrogen, which
would indicate that it till contained dumasin, from which it had been approximately
separated by fractional distillation.
