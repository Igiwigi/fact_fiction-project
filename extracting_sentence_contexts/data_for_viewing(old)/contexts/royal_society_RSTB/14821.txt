given age a (the term within square brackets), multiplied
to the trait effect on the probability of surviving till that age -
(l,(Zm, Z)/(0Zm)). To see the potential relevance of this,
consider a scenario where there are two age classes and the
evolving trait z is the effort invested into fecundity at
age 1. Suppose that expanding more effort diverts resources
from other fitness components, leading to increased
mortality at age 1 and decreased fecundity at age 2. An
increase in z thus results in a decrease in both the probability
of surviving till age 2 (ie. dl(@m, 2)/(Zm) <0) as well
as fecundity at that age (i.e. 0b2(Zm, Z)/(02m) <0), so that
Olo(Zm, Z)/(OZm) X Ob2(Zm, Z)/(0Zm) > 0 causing an increase in
hg") and thus in disruptive selection. In fact, we show in
electronic supplementary material, appendix B.2.5 that poly-
morphism may emerge in this scenario when individuals
compete within age-class. Disruptive selection in that case
leads to the coexistence of two highly differentiated morphs:
one that reproduces at age 1 and then dies, and another that
reproduces only at age 2. Beyond this specific scenario,
equation (3.8) reveals how age-structure opens pathways for
disruptive selection and thus for the maintenance of genetic
variation within populations.
