of their development.

The few previous investigators have failed to trace the egg membranes.

Sir Everarp Home, Mr. Hit, Sir R. Owen, and M. Verreaux have described
the appearance of the ovary in Monotremata. The two first observers pointed out
the large size of the Graafian follicle, and Sir Everarp (37) figured the yellow yolk
they contained, but Sir R. Owen, in 1834 (44), still considered it probable, on @
priori grounds, that the Monotremes had a small ovum, like other Mammalia.

More recently Pountron (51), Brepparp (2), and Guippere (31) have observed the
large size of the ovarian ovum, the eccentric position of the germinal vesicle, and the
fact that the ovum completely fills the follicle during the whole period of ovarian life.

Poutron and GuipberG have wrongly stated that the follicular epithelium remains
always a single layer of cells.

Bepparp figures the true condition, but agrees with the other two observers, ascrib-
ing the appearance of his preparation to bad preservation. PouLron came to the con-
clusion that it was probable that segmentation would be found to be unequal, perhaps
partial. GuLpBERG was unaware, when he wrote, that I had already described the
partial segmentation. GuLDBERG and Brepparp lost all trace of the vitelline membrane
in late stages. The former says the follicular epithelium becomes changed into a
chorion :—‘“es scheint, als ob die Zellen versehmolzen sind, um eine helle, schwach tingir-
