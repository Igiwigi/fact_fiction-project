The differential equation of the radial distribution of temperature, neglecting

S
4 in which & is the thermal conductivity of the liquid, and ¢ the specific heat per unit
6 volume, v the velocity of the stream, 6 the temperature, 7 the distance from the axis,
= and a the distance along the tube. The velocity v is a function of 7, which can be
‘2 easily calculated if the viscosity is assumed constant. As a matter of fact, both
'B the viscosity and the conductivity vary rapidly with change of temperature. The
EB viscosity at 100° is nearly six times less than at 0° C., and its variation is accurately
3 known. But if we assume both conductivity and viscosity constant (as we are
cs practically compelled to do, since the variation of conductivity with temperature is
£ quite uncertain) we shall obtain a solution which is sufficiently simple to be useful,
% and which can be strictly applied to small changes of temperature.
= To simplify the solution still further, I shall assume the longitudinal temperature
g gradient d@/dx constant over the cross-section of the tube at any point, and equal
