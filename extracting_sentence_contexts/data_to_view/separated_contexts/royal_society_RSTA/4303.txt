The eight dinucleotides {AA, CC, GA, GC, GG, TA, TC, TT} of G(Y) have no ingoing edges
and the eight dinucleotides {AC, AG, AT, CA, CT, CG, GT, TG} of G(Y) have no outgoing edges. (Online version in colour.)

Proof. A proof can be found in appendix B. a

In general, the maximal length of a path in a representing graph G(X) of a code has a relation
to the error correcting window of the code, i.e. the longest number of nucleotides that have to be
read in an arbitrary sequence of words from the code X in order to retrieve the correct frame. In
fact, any path in such a graph yields a sequence of nucleotides that can be read in two frames just
by concatenating the labels of the vertices of the path. Conversely, any sequence (of words from
the code) that can be read in two frames yields a path in the associated graph. The exact relation
is not yet clear and has to be investigated in the future but we would like to present an example.
