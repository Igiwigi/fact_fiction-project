country, ‘A very interesting feature is the skilful cultivation of tobacco, which is of fine
quality although the larger leaves become coarse and ribbed. Every village contains
many beds of the plant, old house sites being selected for the purpose, possibly because
of the well-manured soil. The walls are removed before planting and the plot is well
dug and mixed with ashes. The roof is left. As the seedlings become stronger the roof is
gradually removed until only the frame remains. The leaves are collected and dried in
the sun and in the houses; they are then packed in plaited rolls, ranging up to six feet
or so in length.’

The most connected account of the use of tobacco by the western trans-F ly peoples is
that by Williams (1936, pp. 424, 425) who says that native tobacco grows in almost
every village of the Morehead district, though more plentifully in the west than in the
east. ‘A striking fact is that in all the dialects from Kiwai Island to the Bensbach
tobacco is known by one word, sukuva (in various dialectic forms), the sole exception
appearing among the Wiram natives, where it is called kagai. The fact that the plant is
so much commoner among the Semariji and Gambadi than among the Keraki may
have some significance: Keraki informants on one occasion denied that it was known
to their ancestors and ascribed it to their northern neighbours, the Wiram; but the
distribution of this name sukuva throughout a mosaic of differing languages presumably
argues the comparatively recent distribution of the tobacco habit from some common
source; and that source seems most likely to be in the west. Keraki informants showed
me a wild leaf called komakoma which was said to be a bygone and inferior substitute
for sukuva.

‘Tobacco is cultivated principally in the village clearings, where the seed is sown in
