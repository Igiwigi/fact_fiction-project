At the transmission region, with cross-section area Ar and celerity cr, the transmitted pulse
propagates rightwards and no reflection occurs. The state variables at the downstream junction

Applying the junction conditions results in an overall transfer matrix for the Herschel-Quincke
tube with modulated branches that relate state variables at the upstream and downstream
junction
