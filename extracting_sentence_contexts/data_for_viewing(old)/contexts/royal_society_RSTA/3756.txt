mass) have also been performed and the results indicate that the sequence of dissociation
temperatures for Nat-(Bz)4 (T = 280K), K*-(Bz)4 (T =400K) and Cst-(Bz)4 (T = 560K) is not
the consequence of a mass effect. Moreover, the cation—Bz interaction contributions (for details,
see [29,74] and references therein) seem to suggest that the differences in the temperature of
dissociation cannot be due to energy effects. Accordingly, such differences could be due to the
distribution of the Bz molecules in the first solvation shell. An analysis of the radial distribution
functions at temperatures lower than the dissociation one shows the different mobilities of the
Bz molecules around the cation. Figure 5 shows the results obtained at T= 250K for Kt-(Bz)4
and Cst-(Bz)4.

As can be seen in figure 5, the fluctuation of the Bz-M* distances is larger for Kt than for
Cs*, indicating that K*-(Bz)4 forms a more flexible structure than Cst-(Bz)4, thus favouring an
earlier dissociation of K*-(Bz)4 than of Cs+-(Bz)4. In fact, in our previous paper on M*-(Bz)y
systems [29], where the distances between the centre of the benzene rings and the alkali ion were
analysed as a function of the cluster size, it was observed that such distances are equal for the
GM of Cs*-(Bz)4; however, for Kt+-(Bz)4 only three of them are equivalent, while the fourth one is
slightly larger. Moreover, strong ‘magic numbers’ of the M*+-(Bz),, clusters appear at n = 2,3 and 4
for M = Na,K, and Cs, respectively, thus explaining the higher stability of Cs -(Bz)4. The increase
of two molecules of Bz in respect to the magic number n = 2 for Nat explains the dissociation of
the Nat-(Bz)4 at low temperatures.

We report here for the first time global optimization results obtained with the EA described in §3b
for the clusters Ca*+(H2O), (1 =1— 27) and Ca*+(CH3O0H), (1 = 1 — 10). Previously, Gonzalez
