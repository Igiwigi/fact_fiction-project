to the same extent. The glass tube is much blackened, but the spectrum is constant.
BgrTHeLoT has, in fact, already shown that olefiant gas is decomposed by the electric
current, acetylene being at the same time produced. Indeed, as acetylene may, accord-
ing to BerTHELOT, be formed from its elements under the influence of the electric dis-
charge, it is inconceivable that a hydrocarbon gas could be perfectly decomposed in
such a tube as I have described.

The spectrum under investigation having then been obtained in one case when only
carbon and hydrogen were present, and in another when all elements but carbon and
nitrogen were absent, furnishes, to my mind, sufficient evidence that the spectrum is
that of carbon.

But an interesting confirmation of the conclusion just stated is found in the fact, that
the same spectrum is obtained when no other elements but carbon and oxygen are
present, and also when carbon and sulphur are the only elements under examination.
And first with regard to carbon and oxygen. Carbonic oxide burned in air gives a
flame possessing a continuous spectrum. ' A mixture of carbonic oxide and oxygen
burned from a platinum-tipped safety-jet also gives a more or less continuous spectrum,
but the light of the spectrum has a tendency to group itself in ill-defined ridges. Car-
bonic oxide, however, ignited by the electric discharge in a semivacuous tube, gives a
bright sharp spectrum. This spectrum was proved, by the simultaneous method of
observation, to be that of carbon plus the spectrum of oxygen. With regard to carbon
and sulphur almost the same remarks may be made. Bisulphide-of-carbon yapour burns
in air with a bluish flame. Its spectrum is continuous. Mixed with oxygen and burned
at the safety-jet, its flame still gives a continuous spectrum, though more distinctly
