To such as content themselves
with glancing at strongly-marked examples of this type, the propriety of its generic, or
at any rate of its specific separation from Peneroplis, would seem indubitable. Never-
theless I think that I shall be able to show adequate grounds for the belief, that the two
forms cannot be separated by any definite line of demarcation ; and that they must there-
fore be ranked as belonging not merely to the same genus, but even to the same species.

133. In the first place I would refer to the fact that the peculiar plication and puncta-
tion of the surface of the shell, which are such marked features in the physiognomy
of Peneroplis, are repeated in Dendritina (Plate Il. figs. 21, 22) in a manner s0 precisely
s8imilar, as strongly to impress every one who has his attention directed to the aspects of
these two forms respectively, with the idea of their very close relationship.

134. Secondly, the differences of general configuration between Peneroplis and Den-
driting axe differences of degree, and present themselves in very variable amount in
different individuals. For, starting from those forms of Peneroplis in which the spire
is least compressed, the transition is easy to those Dendritine whose spire is least turgid,
and whose septal plane is not broader in proportion to its length than it often is in
Peneroplis.
