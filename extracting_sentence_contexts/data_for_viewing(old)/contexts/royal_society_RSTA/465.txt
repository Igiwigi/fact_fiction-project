the varying operating conditions observed in wind turbines and discussed earlier, a damage
detection scheme is rather challenging. Another major issue is the appropriate choice of sensing
technologies of the blades that could be applied in order to achieve a reliable online SHM system.

Some of the related research studies use either passive or active sensing technologies in the
context of wind turbine blade SHM [35]. The difference between the two sensing approaches
is that in passive sensing techniques there is no external/artificial excitation as is the case in
active sensing techniques. In [36,37], an overview of sensor diagnostics for active sensing SHM
systems by using piezoelectric transducers is given. In addition, an investigation of the optimal
demarcation date that is essential for the proper normalization of active sensing data during their
collection is presented.

Despite the fact that many SHM techniques and sensing technologies have been discussed
in the literature for damage detection in blades, there has not been much progress on robust,
online applications of these techniques in the SHM of in-service wind turbine systems. Some of
the methods that have been applied in references [35,38-44] include vibration monitoring-based
methods (accelerometers, piezo or microelectromechanical systems (MEMSs), strain (strain gauge
or fibre optic cables), ultrasonic waves which are popular with composite structures (piezoelectric
transducer), smart paint (piezoelectric or fluorescent particles), acoustic emissions (usually
barrel sensors), impedance techniques (piezoelectric transducer), laser vibrometry (scanning laser
Doppler), impedance tomography (carbon nanotube), thermography (infrared cameras), laser
ultrasound (laser devices), nanosensors (electronic nanoparticles) and buckling health monitoring
(piezoelectric transducer). In addition, wireless systems seem to be a good solution in the case that
structures are remotely placed such as wind turbines. The main disadvantage of wireless sensors
