We must now
enter pretty fully into the functions of this plexus as revealed by sundry experiments
on the multitudinous and wonderful system of organs which, either directly or
indirectly, depend upon this plexus for their innervation. These organs are the ambulacral feet, the spines, and the pedicellarie. That all
these organs are in nervous connexion with the external plexus is proved by the fact
that when any part of the external surface is touched, however gently, all the feet,
spines, and pedicellarize within reach of that point, and even far beyond, immediately
approximate and close in upon the point, 80 holding fasb to the needle, or whatever
other body may be used as the instrument of stimulation. This simultaneous move-
ment of 8uch a little forest of prehensile organs is a singularly beautiful spectacle to
witness. In executing it, the pedicellarize are much the most active, the spines some-
what lower, and the ambulacral feet, very much slower.
