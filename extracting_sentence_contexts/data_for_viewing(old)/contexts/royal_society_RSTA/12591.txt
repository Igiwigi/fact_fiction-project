than justifies our anticipations.

§8. In the majority of the earlier investigations use was made of 10-day groups
selected by reference to the size of the absolute daily range. In the investigations
now to be described it was decided to employ 5-day groups, and to make the
Greenwich projected sunspot area the criterion for selection. It had become obvious
that the number of days preceding and following the representative day
must be largely increased, if one wished to ascertain the true nature of the
phenomenon, and it was obvious that the arithmetical operations would thus become
exceedingly heavy, even with 5-day groups. Experience had also shown that the
5 days of largest spot area in a month were not infrequently consecutive, while this was
hardly ever the case for the 10 days of largest area. Thus 5 appeared a more natural
number than 10, while the fact that the majority of the 5 days often occurred in a
sequence led to a marked economy of time in entering the data in the several columns.

The main reason for preferring the spot area as the criterion for grouping the days
was that it promised to facilitate the comparison of results from different stations, and
the comparison of results from different elements at the same station. The numerical
results for the sunspot areas for the groups of days of the present investigation will
obviously serve for any similar investigation dealing with the samé period of years.

One slight drawback to sunspot areas as the criterion of selection is the absence
of spot areas for a few days in the Greenwich publications. In these cases the day

- for which information was lacking was disregarded when selecting the 5 days of large
