Several obstacles are blocking increased nuclear power production. These include the fact that
there are few paths to the permanent safe storage of nuclear waste. In most of the world, spent
nuclear fuel is placed in dry casks after several years of cool down in water pools. The plutonium
in the spent nuclear fuel can be chemically separated. The proliferation risk is currently dealt with
by carefully tracking the loading and storage of the casks and by using seals to ensure that there
has been no tampering between periodic inspections.

Three decades of effort have been spent searching for methods to make passive gamma ray
or neutron measurements that can physically determine if the fuel in a cask has been tampered
with. The shielding provided by the cask walls has largely thwarted these efforts [1,2]. A number
of groups have used models to examine the possibility of using muon tomography [3] to non-
destructively inspect nuclear fuel in dry cask storage [4-10]. Recent data obtained on a partially
loaded Westinghouse model MC-10 dry cask at Idaho National laboratory have been used to
