At this stage the base of the skull is very much curved, the basi-facial axis being
placed at the angle of 45° with the basi-cranial axis (figs. 4 and 5). This gives the
skull a curious appearance, which is accentuated by the large size and massiveness of
the lower jaw. Further, in correlation with the fact that the young is now firmly
fixed to the nipple, the lower jaw is directed downwards and the mouth is open for

the insertion of the teat. The occipital plane is at an angle of about 60° to the basi-
cranial axis. A comparison of this model with the models of older specimens and
with the skull of the adult shows that this steep slope of the basi-cranial axis is an

embryological characteristic which is gradually reduced, till in the adult the basi-
cranial and basi-facial axes are in the same straight line.
