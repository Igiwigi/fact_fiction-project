In the British birds the growth of the oocytes continued until, in the second half of April,
they were shed from the ovaries. True and atretic ‘corpora lutea’ were then formed, and
the germinal epithelium was active once more. If, as frequently happened in the adults,
a bird produced a second clutch of eggs in early June, the germinal epithelium had a second
short period of activity. Regression was rapid in June, and the ovary reached a minimum
size in éarly July.

The accessory sexual organs of both the Wolffian and Miillerian systems varied in their
seasonal development according to the degrees of activity of the ovary. As in the case of
the male, some organs appeared to react to a lower threshold of sex hormone secretion
