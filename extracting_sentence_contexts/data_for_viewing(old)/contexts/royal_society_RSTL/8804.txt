(1) KowaLpvsxy was the first to describe, in a precise manner, the formation of the
foundations of the alimentary tract in a developing embryo by invagination of the wall
of a simple primitive blastosphere, or hollow ball of embryonic cleayage-corpuscles.
He detected this mode of development in Amphiozrs, and subsequently in Ascidia. By
later researches he was able to indicate the same mode of development in certain Vermes
(Sagitta, Iumbricus); and he mentioned incidentally that he had observed a similar
deyelopment in the Heteropodous mollusk Atalanta. I was at this time studying
the development of Pisidium and Limarz, and obtained evidence of the invagination of
the primitive blastosphere in those two widely separated mollusks. Subsequently at
Naples I found the same process occurring in Nudibranchs. The probable identity of
this process of invagination with that 80 well known in the Batrachians, especially
through STRICKER's admirable work on the 8ubject, became clear, to those occupied with
embryological studies, from the facts establighed by KowaLgvsky ; and the © anus of
Rvscox1 ” could now be recognized in the * orifice of invagination ” present in members
of the three large groups of Vermes, Mollusca, and Vertebrata.

The embryonic form produced by this invagination-process is a simple sac, composed
of an ectoderm and endoderm, with an orifice connecting the exterior with the cavity
lined by the endoderm. Tt, in short, presents the typical structure of the simplest
Ccelenterata, and corresponds exactly with the 80-called Planula of the polyps and
corals. Hence we are tempted to see in this primitive invagination-form the repre-
sentative of the Ccelenterate phase of deyelopment of the whole animal kingdom. In
a paper published in May 1873*, containing the substance of lectures delivered in the
preceding October, I have discussed this notion at some length, and other points
connected with the attempt to work out the correspondences of the embryonal cell-
