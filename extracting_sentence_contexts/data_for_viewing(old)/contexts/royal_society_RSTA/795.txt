equation of kinetic theory to hydrodynamics, as one has gone from an arbitrary momentum


distribution at a point in space-time to just three of its moments. In integrable models, there is
a significant difference in how hydrodynamical equations are related to kinetic theory. Consider
Lieb-Liniger as an example. As a distribution is uniquely determined by all of its moments under
the Hamburger moment problem conditions, hydrodynamics for all the conserved charges is, at
least possibly, equivalent to a kinetic theory description of the evolution of p(k, x, t).

What form would we expect such an evolution equation for the pseudomomentum to take? In
an integrable model, quasi-particles interact with each other through phase shifts: the initial and
final momenta of two particles going through a collision are preserved, but there is a scattering
phase shift. (In fact the Yang—Baxter equation, which we have used to name a class of integrable
models, is an expression of how scattering phase shifts for three particles are determined by the
two-particle scatterings and independent of their sequence.) According to Wigner, an energy-
dependent phase shift can be interpreted as a time delay, i.e. particles of one momentum k are
delayed by passing through particles of another momentum k’. [=

We thus should expect a Boltzmann-like equation with no collisions that rearrange momentum : 3
but with a velocity at each point that depends on the distribution of other particles,

d:o(k, x, t) + dx(u[{o(k, x, H}lo(k, x, #)) = 0. (3.10) S
