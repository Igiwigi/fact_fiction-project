of all their lamine, were found to exhibit some slight differences in their
centres, on a more complete division.

I shall adopt the same plan which I pursned in my former paper, and present
the results of the analysis in a tabular form, giving, in the order of their occur-
rence from the centre, the consecutive deposits of the different materials of
which the calculi are composed, according to the most prominent character of
such material. I shall include in the Table, both those of the former, and the
present analysis, amounting together to 663 specimens, in order to present, at
one view, a summary of the chemical composition of the whole cabinet *.

* T have placed in the cabinet, a book containing an outline of each calculus, with references; and
would also observe, that some of the facts stated in this communication, have been added since it was
presented to the Society,
