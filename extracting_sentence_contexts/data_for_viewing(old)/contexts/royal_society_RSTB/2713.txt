composition from bone is highly probable, but there is no evidence to show that this
substance actually possessed the histological structure of bone, nor, on the other hand,
is there any direct evidence to prove that it did not. The assumption has been made,
that it consisted, not of cartilage bone, but of calcified cartilage (5, 7); this may very
well have been the case, but the suggestion arises solely from zoological analogies.
That the skeleton consisted of fairly hard substance is suggested by the remarkable
manner in which thin walls and delicate processes are sometimes preserved.

In concluding this account of the mode of occurrence of Palseospondylus, we may
endeavour to reach some conclusion as to the physical conditions under which the
sediments of its “ gisement” were deposited. The rarity of any fossils in the Old
Red Sandstone, except fishes and Crustacea, and of these except sporadically or at
special horizons, where they suddenly become abundant, is a very remarkable fact,
and becomes all the more so when the rich and diversified nature of the contemporaneous
marine faunas is recalled to mind.

Had the Old Red fish inhabited a fresh-water lake, it would have been strange if
fresh-water molluscs had not lived along with them, and this argument is
strengthened rather than weakened by the isolated occurrence of the so-called
Anodonta Jukesii of Kiltorcan, in Ireland ; since, if this fossil has been correctly
referred to the genus, it proves that fresh-water molluscs were in existence, and
flourished in considerable numbers where conditions were favourable. That these
conditions were not general over the Old Red area seems fairly certain. In Russia
there is much evidence to suggest that some parts of the system were deposited in
salt lakes, pseudomorphs of rock-salt occurring in some localities, and the generally
