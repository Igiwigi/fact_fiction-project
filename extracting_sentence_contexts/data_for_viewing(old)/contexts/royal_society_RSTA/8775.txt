44472 is enhanced only from 13°1 to 19°5, and \4026 is unaltered. The phenomenon
is therefore in this case not at all defined as a transfer in increasing amounts to
the members of higher term numbers. It is apparently the resultant of a
combination of this process with the opposite process, resulting in a direct
and special enhancement of 4472 of the same nature as we found with low
pressure.

But the important fact for our present enquiry is that the role played by a large
quantity of Hydrogen is directly contrary to that played by a small trace, and we
may argue that the mechanism of inter-action of the two gases is quite different in
the two cases. A definite phenomenon has been quantitatively isolated which demands
for its appearance only a spectroscopic “trace” of one of the acting gases.

This reversal of the effect of a trace of Hydrogen, by the admixture of more
Hydrogen is, however, interesting in another way, for it introduces us to a striking
difference of behaviour between Diffuse and Sharp series. Inspection of Table XIII.
indicates that the line 17065 shows very little tendency to change in relation to
\4713 by the action of this Hydrogen—or at least that the change in the Diffuse
series is of quite another order. Moreover, the change among the lines \A7065, 4713,
4121, though comparatively small, is quite definitely present as a combination of two
