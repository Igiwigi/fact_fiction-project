The Bore in Tide Rivers.

When the tide is made to rise greatly by the contraction of its channel in
the manner just spoken of, the part of the water s0 affected may be abruptly
terminated on the inland side, the depth and quantity of the water on that
Side not allowing the surface there to be immediately raised by means of trans-
mitted pressure. A tide-wave thus rendered abrupt has a close analogy with
the waves which curl over and break on a shelving shore. Such a tide-wave
is called a bore, and in many places occurs in considerable magnitude ; pro-
ducing great noise by the large amount of intestine motion of its particles, and
appearing to travel with great rapidity, though it in fact moves slower than
the tide-wave under any other circumstances.

The bore which enters the Severn is nine feet high; that in the Creek of
Fundy is said to be till higher. In the Garonne this phenomenon takes place
near Bordeaux, and is called there le Mascaret ; at Cayenne it is called Barre ;
it occurs in the River of Amazons, at the junction of the Arawary, having there
a face twelve or fifteen feet high, and producing a noise which may be heard
at two leagues distance ; it is called by the Indians of the neighbourhood
Pororoca. (LaLanvs, Art. 202.)
