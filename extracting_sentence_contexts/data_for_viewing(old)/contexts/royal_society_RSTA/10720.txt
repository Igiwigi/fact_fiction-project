such factors as ,/(m? + n°) and $(1-+ 7) are of no importance in the ordinary appli-
cations of expressions for the law of disturbance in secondary waves, and that, in
fact, the enquiry after such a law involves a certain ambiguity. In the above deduc-
tion of such a law, we have used the general formule involving sources of two types ;
if we could have used formule involving sources of one type only, the result would
probably have been different ; this is the origin of the ambiguity referred to by Lord
RAYLEIGH.

23. There is another difficulty attending the deduction of a law of disturbance in
secondary waves from formule applicable to the propagation of a system of plane
waves, viz.: that integrals such as (45) taken over an infinite plane are not con-
vergent. The disturbances in the secondary waves ought to combine to give rise to
the disturbance actually propagated, or the result of the integration ought to be to
reproduce the displacements in the primary wave. If we form such an integral as
(45) for a portion of the plane («’, y’), and afterwards extend the boundaries of this
