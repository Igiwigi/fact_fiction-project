Figure 6. (a) Typical variance scaling with system size L at fixed bond dimension x = 32. The inset shows the same plot for
W = 5 with fixed error density, truncating the Schmidt spectrum at a variable bond dimension such that the total cut-off error
is less than 10~", which shows a linear scaling as expected. (b) Typical 5 of I-bits scaling with system size L at fixed bond
dimension x = 32. For high W, the typical -bit is captured to machine precision, flattening out at (log; 5) + 10-Â®.

superlinear growth in variance is that our states are in fact not of constant error density, as we are
simply truncating each bond at x singular values. To construct a state of constant error density,
one would have to consider a variable x on each bond such that the total discarded Schmidt
weight is below an error threshold. In such a scheme, one would still need to define a maximum
allowable x, Xmax, Such that the computation completes within a reasonable time frame. One
can then either discard samples that would exceed this limit (which avoids the issue of potential
Griffiths regions) or truncate the bonds at ymax (which no longer produces constant error density
states). Our fixed-x choice corresponds to the latter with a zero error threshold.

7. Concluding remarks

We have tested the performance of the DMRG-X algorithm for finding highly excited eigenstates
of the disordered XX model. With some small improvements to the algorithm, we were able
