This condition,
in which the members of the two rows were not functional at the same time, BoLK
called “ chorisstichic,’ and believed it to be the result of an increase in the time
interval between the eruption of the two rows. In support of the view he pointed
out that the time interval between the eruption of the two sets differed very greatly

among: various reptiles ; and that in the mammals, while the interval is very
considerable, the germs of both sets are formed very early. The establishment of the distichical condition in the post-canines of the described
cynodonts, together with the fact that there is a very considerable interval in time
between the replacement of the two sets in Thrinaxodon, adds some confirmation to

Borx’s views. In the maxillae, at least, there appear to be only two members of
each tooth family left in place of the large numbers typical of reptiles. Carried one
stage further this reduction would mean that such an animal would erupt one set of
teeth and then, later, another set between the members of the first.
