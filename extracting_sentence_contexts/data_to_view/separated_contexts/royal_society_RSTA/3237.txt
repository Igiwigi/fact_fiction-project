It will be seen that in the Himalayas the deflections are northerly and large, but
® that as we move southwards from the mountains they decrease rapidly—more rapidly
in fact than the law of gravitation requires. As we recede still further from the Himalayas we enter the positive zone, and here
we find a region 1000 miles long and 200 broad running parallel to the Himalayas,
throughout which the plumb-line is always deflected towards the south. As we progress still further southwards we enter the Indian peninsula ; on crossing
the boundary line between the 2nd and 3rd regions we find that the deflection of the
; plumb-line changes its direction and sign; between latitudes 24° and 18°, from coast
to coast, strong northerly deflections averaging 6” now prevail; as we move south-
wards towards Cape Comorin these northerly deflections slowly decrease, and in the
extreme south of India change to southerly.
