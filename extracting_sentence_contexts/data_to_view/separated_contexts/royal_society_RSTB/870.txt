ON THE COLORATION OF THE SKINS OF FISHES, 809

ose that there is no reversion in the matter at all, but that there is some occult
tendency, in certain individuals, of the lower side to imitate the upper. It is a
curious and remarkable fact that there is no tendency shown in Flat Fishes to develop
pigment on the dorsal halves of both sides whilst it is absent from the ventral halves. An interesting fact is the distribution of pigment in the peritoneum in normal Flat
Fishes. In some Fishes the colour of the peritoneum has an effect on the external
appearance, because it is visible through the thin translucent body-walls. Even in
Pleuronectidee in certain species, and in certain stages of other species, the reflecting
opaque tissue of the peritoneum of the lower side is visible from the exterior when
there is little or no argenteum in the skin.
