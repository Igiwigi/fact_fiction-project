Beyond
b there are several remarkable bands, especially those designated in the map by the letters
:and z. Fitself seems to become nebulous; and between it and G appear seven bands,
7, {,Â», &, 0, T, g: the representation of the six last given in the map is on the authority
of one single observation and drawing by Sir David BrEwsTER. It is but rarely that
this part of the spectrum can be seen at sunset ; and the portion beyond G is 80 seldom
visible, and when seen is 80 faint, that no atmospheric lines or bands have been descried
in it. Allusion has already been made to the fact that the band 3 is easily recognizable in
diffused light ; and this is more or less true, as might be expected, of the other bands
and lines. Indeed the western sky after sunset affords a favourable opportunity for
studying those in the more luminous parts of the spectrum. If the sky be red, C, C6,
D, and 3 generally appear as four very black bands; if it be yellow, they are not 80 well
defined.
