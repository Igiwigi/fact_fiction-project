Similar inflection points can be
seen on other bifurcation diagrams. The most striking feature of the diagram in figure 8 is the multiplicity of bifurcations that
takes place in a relatively narrow range of parameter change. This fact confirms that the CGLE
has a myriad of different types of solutions. There are periodic and chaotic solutions in this
region. The chaotic region can be entered through a sequence of period-doubling bifurcations.
