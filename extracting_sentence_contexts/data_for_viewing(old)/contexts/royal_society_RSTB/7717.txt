geographical trend because movements made during the rest of the time were chaotic or
ineffectually up-wind.

Note that the difference between the Iran and Kenya trends—the former against and the
latter with the prevailing wind—is attributed to the combined effects of temperature and wind
structure. Skies were clear in Iran, and it was warmer than in the cloudy Kenya highlands.
If this had been the only difference between conditions in the two places the migration
trend should have been more clearly up-wind in Kenya than in Iran. The swarms in Iran
were often enabled to rise high, probably often beyond visually-responsive range of the
ground, by the warm weather during the day. Yet they maintained their up-wind orienta-
tion because it was not disrupted by gusts or storms. The warmth enabled them to fly for
many hours daily. So their up-wind flight became a major geographical trend, given the
steady wind direction. Indeed, the very fact that they often rose well away from the ground
may have aided their up-wind displacement because they were not grounded by small
temporary wind increases. The swarms in Kenya were held closer to the ground which
ensured up-wind orientation when they did fly, but the wind directions were variable,
flying was often interrupted by gusts and daily flying hours were restricted by cold and rain
so that up-wind flying did not create a trend against the prevailing wind. On the contrary,
the cooler, cloudy conditions, given the gusty winds, created a with-wind trend. Although

the proportion of the total flying time occupied by with-wind moves was small, these moves
were nevertheless so rapid and covered such relatively long distances that they were respon-
