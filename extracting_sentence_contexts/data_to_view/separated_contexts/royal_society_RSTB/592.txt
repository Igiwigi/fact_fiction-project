Where the fimbria and alveus are in contact with the cornu Ammonis they
send a plexus into its cortex. This is especially the case at the anterior and posterior
parts. In the section which is on a level with the under surface of the frontal lobe, the
last vestige of which is seen, the cornu Ammonis increases very much in size, owing
to the fact that it is here cut across in a slanting direction as it descends forwards. The fimbria is much increased in size, and it is turned inwards towards the crus
cerebri, which lies on its inner side, whilst in front is the posterior eut end of the
optic tract. Its most internal fibres are directed backwards and outwards, forming
a thick plexus in the cornu Ammonis, while the rest of them have an antero-posterior
arrangement.
