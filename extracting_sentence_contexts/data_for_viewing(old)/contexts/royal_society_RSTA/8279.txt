group mark as shown in figs. 5 and 6 (Plates 6 and 7).

Under this classification to each specimen was allocated a group letter and number,
these being stamped on the specimen in small characters or, where the material proved
too hard, added by means of an electric engraving tool. In addition, each received a
serial number from 1 to 79 described in the tables as the author’s Research number,
in order to distinguish them from any marks previously added by Farapay.

Bach specimen was further carefully weighed and its dimensions taken,

It was hoped that this classification might provide some insight into Farapay’s
methods of working, if not of the actual nature and composition of individual specimens.
Useful information was, in fact, obtained in this way.

Group “ A” consists of three ingots weighing about 14, 33 and 44 ounces respectively.
The metal had evidently been allowed to solidify in the crucible, from which it had
afterwards been removed. These small ingots do not appear to have been mechanically
worked in any way, nor do they show any signs of subsequent heating.

On the upper surface of Nos. 1/A.1 and 3/A.3 is a small excrescence which will be
familiar to those having experience in the casting of metals, as due to the evolution
of gases on solidification, and known in the steel industry as “ rising.”

Specimen No, 2/A.2 is more irregular in its form than the other two, that is, it is
rather squat in character, and its exterior contour does not conform to the shape of
