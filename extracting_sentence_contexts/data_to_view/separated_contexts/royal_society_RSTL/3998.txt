This duration. is less in this case than in the preceding expe-
riments. This difference is easily accounted for, by taking into consideration the
diminished resistance of the circuit. in such a disposition, and comparing it with that
of the circuit formed by. the entire frog. Of this fact 1 have been enabled to satisfy
myself completely, by introducing a galyanometer in the two circuits, The difference
between the two currents, the same pile being used, is 80. great that it is impossible
to entertain any doubt upon the subject. Since, then, the current is strongest when
the nerve only is traversed, the phenomena corresponding. to the different periods of
excitability of the nerve oughbt to be obtained in a shorter time. I bardly need say
that, the manner of obtaining these phenomena, described at the commencement of
this memoir, is identical with that which I have mentioned.
