Whether the heart wood of oak trees, which are deprived
of their bark in the spring, and suffered to remain standing
till the following winter, recover the whole, or a part of the
good qualities which it loses (or is supposed to lose) in the
spring, is a very interesting question. A few experiments


of the heart wood of trees. 143

which I have made, lead me to think it probable, that both
the alburnum and heart wood become improved in quality
under such circunistances ; but I am not at present in pos-
session of such facts as can enable me to give any decisive
opinion.
I am, my dear Sir, with great regard,
sincerely yours,
