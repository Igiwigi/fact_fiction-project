to resting length, the sample appeared taut. In fact, when
the glue was manually stretched, then released, it snapped
back to its original shape almost instantly, as an elastic
band would. Note that these findings were for samples that
were not taken past the yield point at a strain of 5. The line-
arity during extension, the extent of hysteresis, and the shape
of the stress-strain curve were also the same in preliminary
trials at a strain rate that was roughly ten times greater
(0.5-1 s~?).

The energy dissipation occurred continuously during
extension and was not the result of reaching a critical value.
This can be seen by the fact that the hysteresis occurred
regardless of what strain the glue reached. When stretching
a sample through progressively larger strains, with a return
to the original length after each extension, the same extent
of hysteresis was seen at all strains (figure 4b). Interestingly,
every time the sample was re-stretched after returning to
the original length, the stress while re-extending matched
the low values of the previous return phase. Then when it
