The flock solution corresponds to the case in which all particles move with the same velocity
vector vj = vg with |vg|? =a@/f while the positions X; € RN, i=1,...,M satisfy that the forces are
balanced, that is,

Yo VW = 8) =0.
iAi

The flocking solution corresponds then to the translational movement of the shape formed
by the positions &;€RN,i=1,...,M with velocity vector vg. When the number of particles
tends to infinity, these discrete flocking solutions are approximating continuum density profiles
p satisfying VW * 6 =0 at least over the support of /. In fact, the connection between the
second-order microscopic model (4.1) and the first-order model given by

dx;
a7 =- » VW(x; — xj) (4.2)
j#i

has been clarified in [55,56]. In these articles, it is shown that the stability of flock solutions for (4.1)
is equivalent to the stability of the spatial shape of the flock as steady solution to (4.2). A similar
result at the level of the continuum equations is lacking.
