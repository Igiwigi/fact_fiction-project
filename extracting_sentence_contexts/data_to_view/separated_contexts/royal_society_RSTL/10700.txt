In the course of this work many unexpected difficulties arose, necessitating changes
In the apparatus and the method of operating, and preventing us for a long time
Afrom obtaining any 8uccessful results. In our experiments it was necessary not only

that the heart should live and beat, but that it should be in the best possible
pbysiological condition, and any marked pulmonary edema made an experiment
nearly valueless. This most frequent cause of failure was mainly owing to the
fact that, on account of the large quantity of blood required for an experiment, we
were obliged to use Calf's blood obtained from the butcher ; very often this blood,
as Professxor Mary states in his paper, will bring about cedemia of the lungs in a
short time ; large quantities of exuded serum pour out of the tracheal cannula, the
air-passages in the lungs become choked up with liquid, and the circulation from
the right to the left side of the heart is greatly impeded. We have succeeded,
however, in making a considerable number of experiments in weak all the conditions

were favourable, the cedema, of the lungs not occurring to any marked extent until
after many observations had been made.
