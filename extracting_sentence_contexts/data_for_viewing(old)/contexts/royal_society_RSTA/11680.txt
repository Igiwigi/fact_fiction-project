The Conduction by the Levers.

This lagging only extended over the body of the brake covering all the brass-
work, leaving the levers and balance weights on the levers bare.

These levers being in metallic contact with the brass of the brake assumed at
these points the temperature of the brake, and would conduct the heat along to
the balance weights till it was lost by radiation. As the temperatures were
constant in all the trials this loss of heat would merely form part of the radiation
and be eliminated as the rest; but, owing to the masses of the balance weights and
the Jength of the levers, it must take a long time for the balance weights and the
further parts of the levers to arrive at a steady temperature, a fact which would
account for a greater loss of heat in the first trial made in the day.

In order to obtain assurance that this delay produced no error it was arranged
that after the completion of the series of trials with the brakes lagged, corresponding
to that with the naked brakes, that the balance weights should be removed, and
only the load at 4 feet from the brake left, and a third series of trials made.

Starting and Stopping the Trials.

84. Having adopted an hour as the length of each trial, and 300 revolutions as the
normal speed, the engines having been running for an hour previously, while the
water entering the brake was being adjusted, and afterwards, so as to insure the
