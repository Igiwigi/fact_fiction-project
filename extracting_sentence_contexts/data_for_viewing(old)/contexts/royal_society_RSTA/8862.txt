atmosphere ; the greater the optical thickness the greater the quantity of radiation
returned. The exact relationship we will determine later, but for the moment we will
consider a well-known formula of ScHusTER’s involving this same optical thickness.
Denote this optical thickness measured for a certain wave-length by o,, and let R,
be the total radiation incident from the interior on the inner boundary of the scattering
layer, 8, the total emergent radiation. The formula in question* states that
approximately

Care must be taken to avoid making an incorrect use of this formula. In the first
place, it is incorrect to suppose that the obliquely emergent radiation will be given by
replacing o, by o, sec 9. In the second place, the formula must not be held to imply
that the initially incident beam is cut down in the ratio 1/(1-+-¢,) during transit
through the layer. The simple formula (22) somewhat obscures the fact that the
emergent radiation is the sum of two parts, the depleted incident beam and the light

* In Scnuster’s form the denominator is written 2 + oy, but this is due to calculating +, from the
mean coefficient of scattering of a thin plane layer for all directions.

is better written in the form corresponding to its derivation,
