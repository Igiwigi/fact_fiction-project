great interest which exists in the development of any one of these modes of action ;
for differing s0 greatly as they do in very peculiar points, it is hardly possible that
any one of them should be advanced in its illustration or comprehension, without a
corresponding advance in the knowledge of the others. Stimulated by such a feeling,
I have been engaged with PLuckzr, WEBER, Reiscn and others, in endeavouring to
make out, with some degree of precision, the mode of action of diamagnetic as well
as magnecrystallic bodies; and the recent investigation (2640, &c.) and endeayour
to confirm the idea of polarity in bismuth and diamagnetic bodies, the reverse of that
in a magnet or im iron bodies, was one of the results of that conviction and desire.

2719. Having failed however to establish the existence of such an antipolarity, and
having shown, as I think, that the phenomena which were supposed to be due to it
are in fact dependent upon other conditions and causes, I was induced, in the earch
after something precise as to the nature of diamagnetic bodies, to examine another
idea which had arisen in consequence of the development of magnetic and diamag-
netic phenomena amongst gaseous substances : this thought, with some of the results
which have grown out of it during its experimental examination, I purpose making
the subject of the present paper.

2720. BaxcaLart first showed that flame was diamagnetic*. The effect, as I
proved, was due chiefly to the heated state of gaseous portions of the flaineF; but
besides that, it appeared that at common temperatures diamagnetic phenomena could
