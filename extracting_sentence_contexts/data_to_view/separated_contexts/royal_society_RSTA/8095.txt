Thus vessel 4 loses more vapour than vessel 2. Now lower the temperature to Ty; a volume of air, say, A” c.c. leaves vessel 2 to
enter vessel 1, and carries with it*

A” (7, + e7,)/2 grammes of vapour,
and at the same time vessel 4 loses
(A” + BY”) (e2, + e2,)/2 grammes of vapour. Again vessel 4 loses more vapour than 2, and it is readily seen that both losses are due to
the fact that more air passes over the last vessel than over the first; so that if we had
had vessel 4 charged with EtOH instead of water, the alcohol would have lost relatively
more than the water ; on the other hand, had vessel 2 contained the alcohol, the water
in 4 would then have lost relatively more than the alcohol. The discrepancies between the ratio of vapour densities when derived with water
leading and with EtOH leading are thus qualitatively explained. Turning now to correction 6 (a).
