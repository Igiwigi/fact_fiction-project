Micro-SORS can, however, become relevant
in situations where OCT is not applicable. For example, where real-layer thickness exceeds the
maximum accessible depth of OCT. The higher accessible depth of micro-SORS is facilitated
by the fact that the method relies on the diffuse component of light and can, in principle,
therefore, achieve large penetration depths in turbid samples as demonstrated, for example,
in this study. By contrast, OCT by its nature relies on direct imaging within the sample and
