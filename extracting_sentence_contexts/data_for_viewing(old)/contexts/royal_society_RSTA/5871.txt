emphasis in this approach is perhaps almost orthogonal to the more popular approach followed
nowadays, the data-driven, empirical or ‘actual cosmology’ (for the latter, see [2] for a standard
treatment).

In the following sections, we shall present a panorama of cosmological models that aim
at describing some aspect of the universe. But what is a cosmological model? The standard
definition of a cosmological model in relativistic cosmology (see, e.g. [3] and refs therein),
although extremely helpful for giving orientation and meaning to a very wide set of issues in
cosmology, is perhaps too narrow for our present purposes.

Such definitions (or similar ones given in [4,5]) present cosmological models as having a
timelike (fundamental) vector field together with a manifold and a spacetime metric which
satisfies the Einstein equations. Apart from the fact that general relativity is currently only one out
of many different geometric ways of describing an interaction of spacetime geometry and matter,
there are areas in cosmology where even the very notion of spacetime and that of a fundamental
timelike field are probably too restrictive to use. As typical examples of this, we may mention
the multiverse, the landscape or the notion of braneworld, all of which require other types of
geometry and dynamics for their description rather than that found in the standard definition of
cosmological model.

The beauty and enormous variety of ideas of modern mathematical cosmology have their
roots in the different kinds of geometry required to be developed and studied in parallel and
in conjunction with those cosmological ideas for a better understanding of different aspects of
this most majestic of fields of theoretical physics.
