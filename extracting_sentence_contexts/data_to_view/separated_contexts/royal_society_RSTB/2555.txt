OGILVIE ON THE MICROSCOPIC AND

Considered vertically, however, the series of granulations is interrupted at the
peripheral and inner areas of the septum by irregularly-shaped pores. We may look
upon the series of granulations as the superficial form assumed by a successive series
of growth-parts belonging to a large trabecula. The irregular shape of the septal
pores in Hupsammia is due to the fact that the growth-parts of one trabecula may be
disconnected, and also the growth-parts of adjacent trabecule, When the spaces
thus left run into one another, naturally irregular pores arise. Moreover, since the
secondary outfilling has no definite relation to the structure, the original pores may,
in the course of time, be irregularly diminished in size. New trabecule are inserted at the periphery, and a distinct area of divergence
is there observed (a.d. fig. 50).
