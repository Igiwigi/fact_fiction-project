which it occurs.

In the presence of this peculiar form of tissue at the articular extremities of bones
we may perceive a striking instance of design.

It would appear that the articular cartilage must rest upon a firm and uniform
surface, otherwise it would, under pressure, yield unequally, and the joint would pro-
bably be but imperfect in its action. Circumferential Jaminz are developed only on
free surfaces, and do not present there a very level outer snrface. A surface formed
by Haversian systems would be irregularly fluted or nodulated, like that beneath
the calcified cartilage. Neither of those forms of development, then, would effect a
condition of surface similar to that attained by the ossified cartilage, A careful con-
Sideration of the foregoing facts will, we think, lead to the conviction, that the
presence of ossified cartilage as a basis for articular cartilage must not be regarded
Simply as the result of a slowly progressing ossification of a tissue prone to ossify ;
neither must it be regarded as an imperfectly developed tissue in which the forma-
tive process was arrested before the part had been perfected*; but it must be
regarded as a constant element in the osseous system, having its special use, and
necessary to the perfect organization of the skeleton in the higher forms of Verte-
brata.

Ossified Lacunal Cells â€”In addition to the parts already descrihed, the authors
have found a condition of bone which has hitherto escaped observation, or if seen,
has not been recognized as a form of osseous tissxue. The bones of aged people
not unfrequently become extremely light and spongy, readily break, and from the
