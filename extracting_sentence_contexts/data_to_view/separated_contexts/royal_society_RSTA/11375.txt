+ The statement is also true for the soft y rays from radium. With hard y rays a “density law” holds
and A/p is constant for different elements.



. EMISSION AND TRANSMISSION OF RONTGEN RAYS. 145

The fact is clear from the table that for the same radiator \/p is relatively low
when screen and radiator are alike. With a radiator of copper (or any member of the
Cr-Zn group) the effect is very marked, and Benorst’s transparency curve would in
this case be modified by the addition of a sharp maximum in the neighbourhood of
the atomic weight of the radiator. Barkia and SapLER* have obtained a similar
result in the case of secondary Réntgen rays.
