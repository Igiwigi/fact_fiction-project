the actual structure of the data, estimation of the model can be improved. A closely related
‘non-negative ICA’ approach was proposed by Plumbley [92].

See Plumbley et al. [93] for a detailed review, and Cichocki et al. [89] for further work including
extensions to three-way data.

8. Conclusion

It is probably fair to say that in the last 10 years, ICA has become a standard tool in machine
learning and signal processing. The generality and potential usefulness of the model were never
in question, but in the early days of ICA, there was some doubt about the adequacy of the
assumptions of non-Gaussianity and independence. It has been realized that non-Gaussianity
is in fact quite widespread in any applications dealing with scientific measurement devices (as
opposed to, for example, data in the social and human sciences). On the other hand, independence
is now being seen as a useful approximation that is hardly ever strictly true. Fortunately, it does
not need to be strictly true because most ICA methods are relatively robust regarding some
dependence of the components.


Owing to lack of space, we did not consider applications of ICA here. The applications have
become very widespread, and it would hardly be possible to give a comprehensive list anymore.
What characterizes the applications of ICA is that they can be found in almost every field of
science owing to the generality of the model. On the other hand, each application field is likely
to need specific variants of the basic theory. Regarding brain imaging and telecommunications,
such specialized literature is already quite extensive. Thus, the future developments in the theory
