developing in the nerve itself, and, finally, in some eases, most frequently in stale
nerves and in drugged nerves (by urea, e.g.), the excitatory variation was throughout
reversed (see fig. 8).

§2. Concerning the Unfatiguability of Nerve. Relation between the Magnitude of
Stimulation and the Magnitude of Electrical Effect.

Two characteristics of the nerve-response should be mentioned at this stage, as
being probably significant of a relative simplicity of this form of excitable matter, a
simplicity that may be regarded as rendering nerve the most favourable among
living tissues for the study of modifications by chemical reagents. These are :—

(1). The fact that in nerve the relation between magnitude of stimulus and magni-
tude of electrical effect is arithmetical within at least a considerable range, exceeding
what, judged by the muscular response, may be termed the “ physiological ” range.*

(2). The fact just alluded to that the electrical effect increases with increasing
magnitude of stimulus much beyond the physiological maximum effect as gauged by
muscle.

Both these points have been reported upon elsewhere? and are alluded to here
only inasmuch as they were at the outset of these experiments taken to be indicative
of the relative simplicity of nerve-protoplasm, and having regard to the considerable
range within which the electrical effects had been found capable of plus and minus
variations (¢.g., between 2 and 20 or more stimulation units, as compared with a
