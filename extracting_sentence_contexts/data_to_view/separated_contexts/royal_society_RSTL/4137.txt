The external pellicle, though cracked, is almost entire, but is removed in a
few places (a, a, a), 80 as to expose the brown corneo-calcareous layer which in most
specimens appears as the outer case, as in Plate XIII. figs. 2, 3. The snrface is very
finely striated with delicate interrupted elevated lines, disposed in a longitudinal
direction, as shown in the slightly enlarged drawing of part of the same at fig. 1 a. This structure appears to be analogous to that observable on the back of the sepio-
staire of the Cuttle-fish, and on the guards of certain species of Belemnites; but I have
never observed any traces of such a texture on the surface of the phragmocones of
the latter, which invariably presents the characters delineated in Plate XV, fig. 4, a.]*

According to the facts at present known, the chambered cone of the Belemno-
teuthis appears to me to approximate most nearly to the BelopteraFſ, which has a
horny calcareous conical shell with transverse septa, and is destitute of a guard. Taz BeLEMNITE.—To avoid unnecessary details, I beg to refer to Dr. BuckLaxd's
Bridgewater Essay, Professor Owen's Hunterian Lectures), and my Medals of
Creation ||, for descriptions and figures of the form and structure of the Belemnite as
indicated by the specimens then known ; and I now proceed to describe the most
illustrative example from Trowbridge, which is represented (somewhat less than half
the size of the original) in Plate XV. fig. 3.
