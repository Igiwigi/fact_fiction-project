The only known species is
Asterochlenopsis kirgisica, StENZEL, sp.

1889 Asterochlana (Clepsydropsis) kirgisica, Srmnzeu, ‘Die Gattung Tubicaulis,’
p. 20, Plate 4, figs. 38-44.

1889 Clepsydropsis kirgisica, ibid., p. 25.

1889 Rachiopteris ludwigii, Leuck. and ScuenK, in Scuenx, ‘ Ueber Medullosa
Cotta und Tubicaulis Cotta,’ pp. 553-554, Plate 3, figs. 50, 51.

* Saunt (1928), Plate 6, fig. 45. I am indebted to Dr. Scorr for drawing my attention to the fact
(which T had overlooked when writing on “ Clepsydropsis ” australis) that the rhizomes of Asteroxylon are
frequently found intruded into other rhizomes of the same plant (Krpston and Lana, 1920, p. 645, and
Plate 1, figs. 2-4).

+ I am adopting the specific name kirgisica as being the better known of the two. As already stated
there is no clear evidence on the question of priority. SreNnzet’s specimen was also more complete than
Scnenx’s, as it included the leaf-bearing axis.
