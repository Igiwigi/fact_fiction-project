+ Mr. WarnpurToy has also obtained expressions for the number of partitions as far as 4, and his results,
mulatis mutandis, agree with the above.


422 SIR J. F, W. HERSCHEL ON PARTITIONS,

of lower periods), it is easy to see, that besides a non-periodic portion of 5 dimensions
in z, and a periodic one with 60 constant coefficients, there will also be a circulating
portion of the form

whose coeflicients may rise to the second dimension in x. In fact, if we execute the
calculation of this portion by the foregoing processes, we find for the yalnes of the

coefficients
4500z? +15750z 3209zx

a,=e;=0;  bj=d;== 172800 3 C=775800'

With regard to the constant coefficients of the periodic portion, it is easy to see,
from the manner of their formation, that they must all fall very far short, in nume-
rical magnitude, of the half of 172800, 80 that the whole effect of this periodical part
does, in effect, go to adjust the final value to the nearest integer of the rational frac-
tion arising from the assemblage of all the terms in z, and a similar reasoning will
