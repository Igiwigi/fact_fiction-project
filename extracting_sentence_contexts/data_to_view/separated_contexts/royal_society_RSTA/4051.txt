Another possibility is that when one of the ions of the dissolved salt is also a con-
stituent of the solvent, there is some action between them, whereby either the
number of effective ions or their velocity is reduced. Such an action might require
time to reach its completion, and hence is not inconsistent with the gradual rise in
resistance which has been previously described. It is a well known fact that the
amount of chemical dissociation is greatly reduced when one of the products is already
present. Some such relation may explain the phenomenon in question. The absolute values of the equivalent conductivities of potassium bichromate and
potassium ferricyanide (see below) are, when calculated from the formulae 4K,Cr,O;
and }K;Fe(CN),, higher than the numbers for any of the other salts used.
