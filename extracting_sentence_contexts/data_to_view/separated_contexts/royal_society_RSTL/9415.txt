Secondly, the invisible wave of stimulation through the
excitable tissue of the umbrella may often be seen to have its passage visibly recorded
by the numerous tentacles which in Aurelia fringe the margin of the umbrella—one
tentacle after another successively retracting until the © tentacular wave” of retraction
which started immediately below the seab of stimulation in the umbrella has passed
throughout the whole series of tentacles. In umbrellas with their lithocysts removed
these tentacular waves course all the way round the margin without exciting any
visible contraction in the umbrella-tissue which was the immediate seat of stimulation.;
but if any of the lithocysts are left un $tu, they invariably discharge their ganglionic
influence shortly after a tentacular wave reaches them. These facts, of course, tend to show that in the excitable tissues of Aurelia there
is 8ome element which performs the essential function of nerve—the function, namely,
of conveying stimuli irrespective of the passage of contractile waves. But in view
of the fact that in these same tissues contractile waves may occur of 80 feeble an
intensity as to be almost invisible, it becomes necessary to be quite sure that such
waves may not sometimes be 80 feeble as to be quite invisible, and therefore that what
IT have called nervous waves of stimulation are not in reality only invisible muscular
waves of contraction. The evidence which I have to adduce in order to show that
such is nob the case is happily unequivocal.
