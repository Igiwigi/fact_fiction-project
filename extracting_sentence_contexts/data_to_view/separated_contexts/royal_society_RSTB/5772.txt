The temporal perpendicular, however, has not such a constant relation to the other
parts of the brain{ although the relief the temporal convolutions may give, even on the
outside of the skull, is very conspicuous (ScHWALBE, 1907). But, “si l’on n’a pas ce qu’on aime, il faut aimer ce qu’on a.” Yet it appears that
these two lines may be of some use in estimating homologies, especially of the frontal
fissures, in such casts. Although it does not provide new facts, it nevertheless gives new proof of the
correctness of the fissural homologies stated by Sir ARrHUR Kerr and by myself in
various prehistoric brains, e.g. in that of Pithecanthropus. Besides it may help us in
doing away with misinterpretations concerning the homologies of the frontal fissures in
anthropoids and man.

* T need not here enter again into a discussion about the value of endocranial indentations for the study
of fissures, doubted by Symincron. In this respect I quite agree with Boute and AnTHony (1917), ELL1or
Smrrx and Kerrx.
