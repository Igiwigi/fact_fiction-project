electronic state HO2(A’)*. The excited intermediate complex HO (A’)* can be stabilized with
the third body M, and, as a result, the relatively stable HO2(A’) molecule can form in the
course of reaction (3.11). The rate constant of this reaction was estimated in [7] using the Rice—
Ramsperger-Kassel theory. It was shown that the total rate constant ktot =k@.9) + k@.i12) was
pressure-dependent; however, such a dependence becomes notable only at pressure p > 100 atm.
Therefore, the probability of the quenching channel does not depend on pressure at p < 100 atm.
The recommended rate constants for reactions (3.1), (3.3), (3.6)-(3.12) are listed in table 1.

It should be emphasized that excited HO2(A’) molecules can also form via the process of
electronic-electronic exchange, HO2(A”) + O2(a! Ag) = HO2(A’) + O2(X3E  )- The rate constant
of this process was measured in [50] and was found to be rather high (approx. 3 x
10!° cm? mol~! s~!). Therefore, in the H2—O2 system with SDO addition, the excited HO2(A’)
molecules can form, and this fact requires a special analysis. Note that, in line with [50], the
rate coefficient of the HO2(A’) quenching channel HO2(A’) + M=HO>(A”) + M is as large as
approximately 10!2-10' cm mol~!s71.

(b) CO—0) system

One of the promising synthetic fuels is the synthesis gas consisting mostly of Hz and CO. The
analysis of the combustion enhancement of syngas in air due to the presence of SDO in the
syngas-air mixture was performed recently in [27]. The principal reaction responsible for CO
oxidation in the CO—O system is the reaction

CO + O2(X3 5) =CO) + OP). (3.13)
In the presence of O2 (a! Ag) molecules in the mixture, the reaction
