The conductivity of the inner core could be increased if it were screened more
effectively, in the case of the periodic variations, by the surrounding layers. This could
be done by increasing (within limits) the conductivity near the surface of the earth.
This additional conductivity might either be concentrated in a thin shell at the surface,
or spread throughout the thick shell surrounding the core. The available direct evidence
appears to favour the first of these alternatives, for the thin shell might be accounted
for as representing the influence of the relatively highly conducting oceans, which
cover the greater part of the earth’s surface, The conductivity of sea-water is, in fact,
about 4 10-!! e.m.u., which is considerably higher than the surface value (4 x 10~'
e.m.u.), of «, given by the distribution c of fig. 1; on the other hand, the measured
conductivity of surface rocks is only about 10>! or LO-!° e.m.u.

10. THE INFLUENCE OF THE OGEANS

The possibility that the electric currents induced in the oceans have an appreciable
effect on the magnetic variations was pointed out by Chapman and Whitehead, who
showed that the internal field of diurnal variations could arise from induction in a
uniform core, surrounded by a thin uniformly conducting surface shell, of which the
conductivity did not exceed that of a uniform ocean about half a mile deep. The
actual oceans, if uniformly distributed, would cover the earth to a depth of over 2 miles,
