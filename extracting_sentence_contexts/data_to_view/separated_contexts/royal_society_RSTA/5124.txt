The amplitude of the oscillatory motion of Â¢)/A at w
is not very much affected by A, as it is dominated by the linear term. Figure 11b,c shows that heave
and pitch motions are not dominated by a single frequency, even at a smaller wave amplitude. In
fact, as the triple wave frequency is set at the natural frequency of pitch, which is also close to that
of heave (table 2), the nonlinear components in the motions will be relatively more significant. Because of this, as A increases, the heave and pitch motions at 2m and 3w become more and more
pronounced. However, compared with the surge motion, the overall motion amplitudes of heave
or pitch are still much smaller.
