the ceramic sample and the window material. These perturbations can be reduced by choosing
sapphire as window material due to the fact that the impedance ratio between silicon carbide and
sapphire is closer than that between silicon carbide and lithium fluoride.

6. Conclusion

Currently, a deeper understanding of the mechanical behaviour and damage modes of brittle
materials such as ceramics as a function of the loading rate is required. To do so, the plate-impact
testing technique has been widely employed since the 1970s. However, this technique does exhibit
some limitations. In particular, a shock loading with this technique does not provide regular
and accurately controllable loading rates. Therefore, due to this limitation, several alternative
testing techniques have been recently developed, such as high-pulsed power devices. In addition,
these new technological devices have the ability to attain non-shock thermodynamic states
(isentropic compression loadings) of the test sample material. The use of functionally graded
