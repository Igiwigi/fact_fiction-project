According to my own
Sexperience, this variation is most frequent in the Flounder, Pleuronectes flesus; in
Sthe neighbourhood of Plymouth a large percentage of Flounders are sinistral instead
Sof dextral. Â® It is a curious fact that in a sinistral Flat Fish, whether it is normally sinistral like
sathe Turbot, or abnormally like a reversed Flounder, the viscera are in the same
position as in a dextral specimen; the liver is on the left side, the coils of the
intestine on the right. The reversal of the relations of the two sides externally does
Snot affect the relations of the internal organs, which remain constant. 3
