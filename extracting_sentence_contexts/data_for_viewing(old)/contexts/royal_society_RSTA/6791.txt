DEPTHS AND EXTINCTION COEFFICIENTS OF SHALLOW WATER 167

values of («-+-f) must remain constant throughout the profile. The brightness profile does
not permit determinations of extinction coefficients on a vertical line as in the photo-cell
method developed by Atkins & Poole (1933, 1936) and others.

Variations in the extinction coefficient, even over the depth ranges of interest (say
0-30 ft.), are certainly possible, whether caused by storms, currents, pollution, diatom out-
bursts, or the mixing of different water types as at the mouth of estuaries (Clarke 1938;
Le Grand 1939; Orr 1933; Poole & Atkins 1926; Sverdrup e¢ al. 1942; Utterback & Williams
1935), and such changes may be detected from analysis of brightness profiles. Values remark-
ably constant with depth have, however, been recorded by many workers (Atkins & Poole
1933; Clarke 1936, 1938; Erikson 1933) under conditions which are in fact most suitable for
vertical air photography of the sea-bed; therefore for this analysis the change in extinction
coefficient with depth over the range of depths concerned should be small.

The change of extinction coefficient as the distance from the shore increases may be
marked. High extinction coefficients may occur in the very shallow water close to the water
edge, due to the increased quantity of suspended matter, and possible air bubbles, in the
waves breaking on the shore. It has been found that this effect is negligible if the water is
calm and a few feet deep; the use of modified forms of equations (3) or (4) will, however,
enable depths and extinction coefficients to be determined from this point onwards. The
necessary modification is discussed later.
