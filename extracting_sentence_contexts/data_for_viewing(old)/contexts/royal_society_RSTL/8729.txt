of magnetism by weights on and increase by weights off, when the magnetizing current
was flowing. But when the current was stopped large effects (larger than those when
the current was flowing) were produced by putting on and taking off the weights ; and
these effects were always of the same Kind, whichever had been the direction of the
current.

195. I have not yet been able to explain these effects by terrestrial magnetic force®*,
nor to even guess any other possible cause ; and have in fact, since the 23rd of December
last, been exceedingly perplexed by seeming anomalies which the various soft-iron wires
tried have presented, commencing that day with a reversal of the electromagnetic effect
of the © off ” and © on” which the first of the wires experimented on showed after the
magnetizing current had been made for the first time and broken, and a weight of 14 1bs.
put on and off several times had first shaken out. nearly one third of the residual mag-
netism, and then given alternate augmentation by © on ” and diminution by © off” of the
magnetism that remained. A weight of 28 1bs. was then hung on, and it stretched the
wire permanently by about 8 per cent. of its length. Then immediately I found reverse
effects by putting.off and on and off the 28 1bs., and on and off smaller weights—the

residual magnetism, if residual magnetigm there was, from the first magnetization by
the current. '[his quality remained until an hour or two later, when the current was
