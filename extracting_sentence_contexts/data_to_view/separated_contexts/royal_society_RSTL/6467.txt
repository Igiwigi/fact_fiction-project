fact is the reason why the equations of vis viva can be obtained by multiplying Evizr's
three equations by w,, w,, z, respectiyely, and by adding together the products 80

70. If G, be the sum of the moments of the impressed forces about the instantaneous
axis, then by D'ALEMBERT'S principle G, equals the sum of the moments of the moving
forces about the instantaneons axis. Hence it follows from the preceding section that
