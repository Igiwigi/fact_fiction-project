the fact that in such tadpoles the cells of the tail increase in age from the base to the
tip, and according to Cump’s theory of susceptibility one would expect the cells in
the tip to be affected first.* This is supported by the phenomena seen in those tadpoles
that have existed as such for many days (those in water of high pH), where the difference
in age between the base and tip cells of the tail becomes relatively small. In this
case phagocytosis, when it does occur, may commence at any point, and it more often
occurs at the base or middle of the tail than at the tip, when only the tissue between
the trunk and the most proximal region of phagocytosis becomes stored within the
trunk. In viviparous ascidians, such as Styelopsis grossularia, eggs are fertilised a few at a
time, but the tadpoles are retained until twenty or thirty have been formed.
