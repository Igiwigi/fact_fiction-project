The theory developed here is free from a specific form of a kinetic equation (at least, as long
as it is linear). For example, it is straightforward to apply it to fractional kinetics with spatio-
temporal non-locality. In fact, the action principle for the fractional Fokkerâ€”Planck equation and
the corresponding canonical theory have already been constructed [29]. It is also pointed out that there have been continuous research activities of non-local non-
equilibrium thermodynamics [38-41]. It may be of interest to examine such discussions from
the viewpoint of generalized kinetics as in the traditional shift from the kinetic stage to the
hydrodynamic one.
