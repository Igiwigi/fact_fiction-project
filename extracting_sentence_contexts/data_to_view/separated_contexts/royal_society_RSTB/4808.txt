But over the very long
periods which have to be considered there must be a countervailing tendency to ultimate
decrease in the number of individuals, owing to the increase in the number of species. The area available being limited, the tendency, as it seems to me, must be towards greater
and greater numbers of species and fewer individuals in each.* Possibly the fact that
ignoration of the number of individuals leads to results in close accordance with the data
may only indicate this tendency first to increase and then to decrease in the size of the
species. (c) The possible effect of size of genus (number of species in the genus) on the chance
of a generic mutation is also ignored. This assumption may or may not be correct, but
was deliberate.
