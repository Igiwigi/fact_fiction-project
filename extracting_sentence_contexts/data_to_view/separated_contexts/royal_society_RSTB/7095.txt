The sunken cell bodies also
show traces of birefringence. As elongation continues the birefringence of the frenulum
hairs increases (figures 29, 30, 31 and 32, plate 2). This is shown by the fact that in order
to compensate the rudiment to blackness, the 74g W.L. plate has to be rotated farther from
the null position; if, after compensating to blackness, the rudiment is rotated into the
addition position, the field is increasingly bright with successively older rudiments. This
may mean that the thickness of oriented material deposited in the cell membrane is
increasing, or that the degree of orientation of material already deposited is increasing
with age. Both may well occur.
