applies to the aggregate relation, that is, when it is not more than m-fold, is of an order
equal to the product of the orders of the constituent relations; or, say, the orders of the
given relations being p, ', -- ., the order of the aggregate relation is =jp.. . .

43. We have considered 80 far relations which involve only the coordinates (&, y,...)*;
the coefficients are purely numerica], or, if literal, they are absolute constants, which
either do or do not satisfy certain conditions ; if they do not, the relation assumed in
the first instance to be fold is really k-fold, or, as we may express it, the relation is
really as well as formally þ-fold ; if they do satisfy certain relations in virtue whereof
the formally &-fold relation is really less than /-fold, say, it is (£&—1)fold, then the rela-
tion is in fact to be considered ab initio as a (E&—1)fold relation : there is no question of
a relation being in general {-fold and becoming less than &-fold, or suffering any other
modification in its form ; and the notion of a more than m-fold relation is in the pre-
ceding theory meaningless. '

44. But a relation between the coordinates (#, y, . . .) may involve parameters, and 80
long as these remain-arbitrary it may be really as well as formally &-fold ; but when the
parameters satisfy certain conditions, it may become (#—!)fold, or may suffer some
other modification in its form. And we have to consider the theory of a relation be-
tween the coordinates (z, y, .. .), involving besides parameters which may satisfy certain
conditions, or, say simply, a relation involving variable parameters. If the number of
the parameters be m', then these parameters may be regarded as the ratios of m' quan-
tities to a remaining 971th quantity, and the relation may be considered as involving
