Those lectures triggered my deep interest in studying Oliver Heaviside’s work and, even more, : S
his whole life. And this very interest drew me to (then PhD student but now Dr) Christopher : 2
Donaghy-Spargo, with whom we founded NEMIG—northeast Electromagnetics Interest Group, : &
which since 2013 has enjoyed a formidable series of seminars given by scientists, engineers, : _
historians and entrepreneurs, driven by the ideas and lives of Maxwell, Heaviside and generally ane]
by the exciting field of electromagnetism. : 2

Coming back to the main object of this paper, which is the relationship between energy current : 3
and computing, I must admit that I had drawn most of inspiration from my familiarization with :s

Heaviside’s work, his legacy in the work of others, and to a great extent by the fact that both Ivor
Catt and David Walton came to studying electromagnetic theory from the point of view of energy
current through their experiences in dealing with high-speed digital electronics. This electronics
does not deal with sine waves. It deals with digital pulses, which are physical enough to be dealt
with in a ‘more physical way’ rather than expressing them as an algebraic sum of sine wave
harmonics stretching in the time domain from —oo to +00. Such pulses have a clear starting point
in time and endpoint in time. They naturally lend themselves to causality between actions, such
as a rising edge of one pulse causes a falling edge of another pulse, for example, as the signal
passes through a logic NOT element (inverter). As I spent most of my own 40 working years
exploring asynchronous self-timed digital circuits, and such circuits could work directly when
the power is applied to their vdd lines, I was firmly attracted by the natural beauty of the ideas
of the electromagnetic theory approach relying basically only on energy current, Poynting vector
(S=E x H, vector product of the electrical field vector and magnetic field vector, representing the
