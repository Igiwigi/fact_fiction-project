470 DRS. T. ANDERSON AND J. S. FLETT ON THE ERUPTIONS OF THE

from our sight by the intervening ridges of Morne Ronde. Vast globular bodies of
fire were seen projected from the fiery furnace, and bursting fell back into it, or over
it on the surrounding bushes, which were instantly set in flames. About four hours
from the lava boiling over the crater it reached the sea, as we could observe from the
reflection of the fire and the electric flashes attending it.”

Now this looks very circumstantial, but the fact remains that when we were at the
mouth of the Larikai this summer we saw no lava in the bed of the stream there.
This torrent flows down a tremendous gorge, cut in the old lavas and tufts of this
part of the mountain. On the shore below there had been a small alluvial fan, but,
as already mentioned (p. 454), it had slid away and disappeared during the eruption
of this year. In the mouth of the gorge there was a low cliff, some 50 feet high or
more, capped by a few feet of the new, hot sand. The cliff consisted of a material so
exactly similar to the ash that overlay it that, if it had not been for the old burnt
soil, it would have been hardly possible to find a line of demarcation between the two
deposits. We were at once struck with the similarity, and came to the conclusion
that here was the evidence of a dust avalanche eruption previous to that of this year.
We could not land, as the bare cliff of voleanic sand was tumbling in frequent
landslips into the sea, but we rowed quite close in, and could make out all the more
