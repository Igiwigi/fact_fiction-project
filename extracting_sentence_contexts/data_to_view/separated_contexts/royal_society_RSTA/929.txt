'= 0:5 cm. (40°, 50°). NITROCELLULOSE IN ACETONE-WATER MIXTURES, 255

Partial Vapour Pressures of Acetone-water Mixtures.—In view of the fact that there
is an acetone-water complex formed, it seemed desirable to have measurements of the
partial pressure of acetone-water mixtures, as this figure is proportional to the activity
of the acetone in the solution: for where there is a complex the concentration alone
may give quite an erroneous measure of the “active mass” of the acetone. The
apparatus just described was suitable for the measurements. Taste I.—Total Vapour Pressure of Acetone-water Mixtures.
