is nearly insensible.)

'To use it the spring balance is tended till it keeps the arm near the middle of the
opening of the box ; the arm is then pressed back to touch the box, the cord is looped
on the pin already mentioned and shortened till the eross jus rests on the tube, and
the 0 read which gives the zero of the auxiliar. Dedneting this from the mean 8, we
have #, the measure of the auxiliar tension.*

The largest oscillation which I have observed under this arrangement was 54%;
the wind was moderate, V being only 16". This is equivalent to a change of tension
=764 grains at the cups, nearly 04 of the entire tension there. I cannot account for
the great irregularities of this friction, but T believe similar facts have been observed
on a large scale in applying Proxy's brake to machinery. The extent and frequency
of the oxcillations do not seem to follow any regular law of V or », thongh they
evidently are related to them.

(67.) The process described in paragraph (58) gives for each observation an equation
containing three unknown quantities, a, «-, y, and two unknown variables, V and V”,
or V+w, w being the difference of wind at the two instruments. Tt is shown by
Table XX. that w may be considerable for a few seconds, but when the time is a few
minutes it is probably confined within the limits +3. Even when (as in the whirling
experiments) we know V approximately, and have not V* to consider, the coefficients
are 80 related that it is impossible to get accurate values of the constants by the usual
methods of elimination, and here the difficulty is still greater. I have therefore
