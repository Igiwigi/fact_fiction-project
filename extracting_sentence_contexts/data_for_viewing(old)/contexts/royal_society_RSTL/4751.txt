2922. Proceeding to a point b, there the lines of force have dip. The same physical
effect will be produced upon them here as before, 3. e. the portions in the atmosphere
will open out; but neither here nor in the former case will they continne to have the
same curyature as before, for towards and in the earth, where they have their origin,
they are restrained more or less from altering by the unchanging action of the earth
(2919.) ; whilst at their more advanced parts, as at c, they enter into portions of the
atmosphere which are nearer to the most intense lines of solar action, H C, probably
also into the region of most intense action, and also into space, circumstances which
cause more displacement of the lines, tending to separate by the tension of the parts
altered in the air, than can happen in the earth (2848.). So the magnetic line of force
at b will not move parallel to itself, but being inclined a certain degree to the horizon,
when in the normal condition, will be more inclined, 7. e. will have more dip given to
it by the presence of the sun. This is the. fact made manifest by the needle when in-
dicating the position of the line as to inclination (2908.) at Hobarton, Toronto or
elsewhere, by the motion of its upper end; for it is manifest that whatever happens
on one ide of the place of the sun and magnetic equator, when, as in our supposition
(2920.), they coincide, will happen on the other.
