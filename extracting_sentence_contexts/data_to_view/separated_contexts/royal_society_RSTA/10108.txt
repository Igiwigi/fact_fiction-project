This diminishes the absorptions
throughout the spectram. But the volume proportion »—’ of crystallites produces absorption which is
much greater for the red and yellow than for the green and blue rays. The superposition of the
absorptions produced by p’ and by ».—’ would thus produce an absorption curve in accordance with that
observed,

* The aggregate may be supposed to be comparable in size with a wave-length of light ; the intensity
of the light reflected from it would thus be proportional to the square of its diameter, while the intensity
of the light diffracted by the small spheres is proportional only to the sixth power of their diameters.

{| A similar explanation possibly applies to the fact that when light, transmitted through a stretched
membrane containing gold in suspension, is polarised in the direction of stretching, the emergent light is
red, but when the incident light is polarised in a perpendicular direction the colour is blue, the gold
clumps being comparable with a wave-length in the direction of stretching, but not in a perpendicular
direction. (Cf. AMBRONN, ‘ Ber. d. math.-phys. Kl. d. k.
