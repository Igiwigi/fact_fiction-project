three variations were set off p{us or minus, and connected by red lines drawn from point
to point,

It requires only a glance at these projections to see with how much fidelity the
calculated represents the observed curve, in spite of the effects of the larger irregular
variations on the means for each period, and on the appearance of the obseryed curves
for the periods in which they occur.

The conclusions drawn are as follows :;â€”

1st, The increase of amplitude of the oscillations which appears in February and
March, and in September to November, 1844, is explained by the occurrence, near the
same time, of the maximum actions of the s8un and moon. In order to show this fact
more distinctly, the separate actions of each body are projected above the oscillation for
February 1844 (Plate 38).

2nd. The diminution and apparent disappearance of the oscillations in June and
July, which seemed 80 inexplicable when only one canse of yariation was supposed to
exist, are explained by the opposing actions of the two causes, the maximum of the one
occurring at the same time as the minimum of the other. The independent actions of
each body are shown in the projections below the movement for June (Plate 38).

3rd. The variation of the time of single oscillations is explained in a similar manner
by the combinations of the different variations.
