Rocks of such high susceptibilities are certain to cause magnetic disturbances.
Further, such rocks need not occur in exceptionally large quantity in order to cause
disturbances such as those at Rempstone and Melton, measured by 170y.

A difficulty arises from the fact that the central coarser portion of the Owthorpe
dolerite shows the extremely low susceptibility 9x 10-*. This value is exceptionally
low for a doleritic rock, but it may be purely local and due to the particular form
taken by the iron-ores present in the rock (see p. 105). The figure will also be
brought below the normal because of the extent to which the rock is impregnated
with calcite. The figure should be compared with the higher values 391, 279, and
210x10- for the Whitwick, Kelham, and Southwell dolerites, and with 255 x 10-°
the average value determined for basaltic rocks by RéioKER and Wurrr.

(vi.) Intrusions being of quite local character, and often irregular in shape, are
more likely to cause sharp changes in the character of the magnetic disturbances
than sedimentary rocks occurring as horizontal or gently dipping sheets.
