All of these func-
tions can be assumed to have undergone stronger selection in
volatile ecological niches. Importantly, humans themselves
must have amplified these selective pressures, through their
own colonizing behaviour which regularly exposed them to
new ecological stresses requiring rapid accommodation [33-
35]. The fact that contemporary humans demonstrate remark-
ably low levels of genetic diversity [36], despite having
colonized a huge variety of ecological niches [37], indicates
that plastic responses have been the key mode of geographic
adaptation. As with other species exposed to volatile environ-
ments, human genetic evolution appears to have shifted from
local differentiation to the enhancement of plasticity [24,38]. In this context of persistent ancestral exposure to ecologi-
cal volatility [23], the evolution of the brain and adiposity in
Homo are intricately connected.
