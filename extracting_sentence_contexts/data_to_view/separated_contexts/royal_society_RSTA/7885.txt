THEIR APPLICATION TO SOME WAVE PROBLEMS. 271

If r be the radius of a sphere whose centre is at the centre of the disc, and if r = cAt,
then the diameter of the dise must be small compared with 7, and r must be small
compared with 2. The change in energy of the motion of the disc in time At is merely communicated
to the fluid within the sphere of radius 7, as a first approximation, that is when the first
power of « only is retained in the expression for the motion close to the disc. Radiation
depends upon the higher approximations, and this is verified clearly in the theory here
developed by the fact that the first power of « disappears in the expressions for the
scattered wave. Case II. « in the neighbourhood of 3.—When « is large but not much greater than 3,
some very interesting results can be obtained from the theory so far developed. In
fact, when « =x the diameter of the disc is equal to a wave-length, and the develop-
ment of an approximate theory is fully justified if it can be applied to this problem.
