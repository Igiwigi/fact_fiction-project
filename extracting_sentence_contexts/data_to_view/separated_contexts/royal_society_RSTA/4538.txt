It is evident from the above numbers that it took about 20 minutes for equilibrium
to be established at this temperature, a fact which gives some indication of the
prodigious labour required in taking the observations. Another hysteretic effect, which is more likely to be a source of trouble in
experiments on the effect of change of pressure, is a time lag of the change in the
leak behind the change in the pressure. In testing for an effect of this kind it is
evident, from the preceding paragraph, that it is necessary to keep the temperature
constant while the pressure change is made.
