2. Human domain

Conservation, rewilding, restoration and degradation of eco-
systems are all human endeavours and any model or
perspective that insufficiently addresses this reality will face
insurmountable challenges. Most conservationists recognized
the role of humans in the past century or two in contributing
to the loss and degradation of grasslands but there is less rec-
ognition of the importance of humans in the management of
these landscapes prior to European settlement. In fact,
humans have played a significant role in the development,
maintenance and degradation of North American grasslands
for over 10000 years (figure 2). Human culture in the North
American Great Plains has been variable in space and time but
generally transitioned from mostly hunterâ€”gatherers to Euro-
pean settlers who were largely focused on subsistence

agriculture. This European dominance eventually transitioned
to industrial agricultural landscapes where grasslands were
small remnants of their historical vastness.
