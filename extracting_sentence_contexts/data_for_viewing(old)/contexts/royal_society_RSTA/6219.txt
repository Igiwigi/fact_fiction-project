Dark energy representing the major component of the current acceleration of the universe has
become the prime focus of attention since 1998 when two groups [162,163] using different datasets
and techniques discovered that observations showed that the speed of the expansion of distant
supernovae curved upwards with relation to their distance. This discovery has had an immense
impact on cosmology ever since, and confirmed the expectations of a cosmological constant—the
so-called ACDM (CDM here stands for ‘cold dark matter’, cf. [164, Section 7.2]) phenomenological
model—but allowed for the existence of many more exotic stresses to describe this mysterious
kind of energy.

Today models of dark energy span the whole range of possibilities, from a cosmological
constant, to scalar fields—the so-called quintessence—to modified gravity theories. It is indeed
an amazing feature of this hypothetical type of energy the fact that it has unified in a single quest
the incredible spectrum of modified gravity theories and other exotic forms of energy to search
for the missing explanation of this observed effect.


Dark energy appears as a property inherent in space-time because it is perfectly uniform and
insensitive to space-time being empty or full of galaxies, or with respect to the direction we
look, or the era in the universe history, or spatial location. The constraints from the supernovae
observations, the CMB temperature fluctuations and the baryon acoustic oscillations (that is
residual sound waves imprinted in the clustering patterns) all converge to the astonishing dark
energy budget of about 72% in the overall matter energy content of the universe. Another
component of the remaining material in the universe consists of dark matter with a percentage
of about another 24%. The mysterious fact that the visible components of matter and radiation
