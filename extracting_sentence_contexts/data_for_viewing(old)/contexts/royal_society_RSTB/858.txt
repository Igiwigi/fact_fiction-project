nected with the sensory surfaces of the mouth, and it also shades off into a plexus
of filaments connected with the epithelium lining the cesophagus. In point of fact,
it may be very accurately described as a local hypertrophy or condensation of this
cesophageal sensory nerve plexus, The outer ring, on the other hand, is connected

with the innervation of the well-developed muscles of this region, and may similarly
be described as a local development of a nerve-plexus connected with the musculature
of the cesophagus. Having thus established the fact that the inner ring is sensory
and the outer motor, can we proceed a step further and identify the two rings with
the two parts, anterior and posterior, of the typical ganglion? The connections of
the commissural portions, that is, those thicker portions which lie on the posterior
surface of the oesophagus stretched between the ganglionic enlargements on each
nerve cord, enable us to do this with certainty. The anterior and posterior com-
missures of the typical ganglion present, as we have seen, certain well-defined
structural characters. The anterior commissure, unlike the posterior commissure,
does not lie stretched between two cell groups. On the contrary, its fibres plunge
directly into the ganglionic plexus. The commissural portion of the external ring of
the circumoral ganglion presents this feature. On the other hand, the posterior
commissure of the typical ganglion does lie stretched between two cell groups, and a
similar connection characterizes the commissural portion of the inner ring of the
