It is not however to be supposed that this cyanide is present as a chemical com-
pound in the above proportion, as the differences in the analyses show that it occurs
in varying and not very definite proportions.

It would indeed appear that the barium and sodium nitroprusside contained a
body in which the iron and cyanogen are in the same proportion as in ferrocyanogen
(Fe Cy,). But as the silver salt precipitated from them does not contain an excess
of carbon, it can scarcely be supposed that this would not be precipitated. But in
fact there are no data further than the mere ultimate analyses upon which reasoning
can be founded with regard to this dissolved and combined foreign substance in the
partially decomposed nitroprussides. As however all their essential characters and
their crystalline form remain altogether unaltered, we cannot view the foreign sub-
stances as more than accidental.

SECTION IV.â€”Action of Caustic Alkalies on the Nitroprussides.

25. When a dissolved caustic alkali, such as potash or s0da, is added to a solution
of a nitroprusside, the dark red colour of the solution changes to an orange-yellow.
If both solutions have been moderately dilute, no oxide of iron is precipitated, nor is
ammonia evolved. The addition of alcohol to the orange-yellow liquid causes the pre-
cipitation of an aqueous solution of a new salt. This salt may be procured in a solid
