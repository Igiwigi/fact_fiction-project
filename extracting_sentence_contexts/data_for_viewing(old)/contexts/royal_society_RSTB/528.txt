ammonia free air passed through it, showed very little ammonia evolved. He points
out that the more imperfect the ventilation of the soil, the less was the gain; and he
considers it probable that in the absence of ventilation the evolution of free nitrogen
would be enhanced. In fact the losses were greater in experiments 2 and 3 with
vessels 80 cm. (= 31°5 in.) deep, and only 11 cm, (= 4°3 in.) wide, than in No. 1
with a width of 17°5 em. (= 6°9 in.).

It is indeed obvious that, with vessels so narrow and deep, and closed at the
bottom, as according to the description we conclude they were,* and with no plant to
cause evaporation, and with consequently very little atration, the conditions would be
favourable for the evolution of free nitrogen, and the more so in the narrower vessels.

In fact it may be doubted whether, if there had been holes at the bottom of the

* We have since ascertained that the vessels were closed at the bottom.

vessels, and free aération had been kept up, there would have been any loss at all
from a soil containing, as this soil did, less than 0°1 per cent. of nitrogen.

It is further to be observed that the losses with growth were, in No. 6, where the
one lupin plant died before blooming, and where only 7 of the 20 incarnate clover
seeds grew, and in No. 7 where only one of the two lupin seeds grew, and it gave
