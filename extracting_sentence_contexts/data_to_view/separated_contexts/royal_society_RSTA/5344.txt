Nowhere are there any intervening sedimentary beds, or any deposits requiring
Hength of time for their accumulation—the only subsequent work requiring time being
comprised in the alluvial accumulation of our great rivers. Besides, on Crouu’s hypothesis, Man must have remained comparatively stationary
during a vastly long period. But how does this accord with the facts. Take
the earliest works of Man with which we are acquainted—the rude implements
of the Chalk plateau—and note the difference between them and the implements of
the later Valley gravels. The former consist of rude flints picked up on the surface,
and given only such an amount of trimming as to bring an angle to a point, or to
form a cutting edge out of a blunt natural fracture, or else the stones, just as they
were found, were used as hammers and trimmers.
