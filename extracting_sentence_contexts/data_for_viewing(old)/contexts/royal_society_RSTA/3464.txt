One of the nice things about looking for OB stars in nearby galaxies is that there is virtually no
foreground contamination: one can be pretty sure that blue stars in the right magnitude range
really are members of that galaxy. There are, however, two down sides. First, these stars are so
hot that their observable light is on the tail of the Rayleighâ€”Jeans distribution, and there is very

little difference in the colours of these stars over a significant temperature range (30 000-50 000 K). : =
Yet the bolometric corrections are quite sensitive to effective temperature, and so converting the : a
observables to physical properties reliably requires spectroscopy once a suitable sample has been 12
identified [5]. aes

The second problem is that these stars are fainter than their evolved descendants, the yellow : _
and red supergiants, owing to the fact that massive stars evolve at fairly constant bolometric [4
luminosities and that OB stars are so hot that most of their flux is in the far-ultraviolet. This : ee
is particularly true for the most interesting of these massive progenitors, the young (zero-age) : S
massive O-type stars. : &

We illustrate this in table 1 where we use solar-metallicity single-star evolutionary tracks of the
Geneva group [6] to list the expected stellar parameters as a function of age. This is based upon
table 1 of [5], but uses models that are 20 years more advanced.

Massive stars evolve at (more or less) constant log L/Lo. As the star evolves, the star expands,
the effective temperature cools and the surface gravity decreases. The star becomes visually
brighter because the peak of the spectral energy distribution shifts to longer wavelengths as the
temperature cools. Thus, a 6 Myr old 25Mo star (spectroscopically, an O8.5 I) has an absolute
