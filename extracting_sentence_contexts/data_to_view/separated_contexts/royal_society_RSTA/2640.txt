Fourth Series—Effects of Electric Fields upon a CH, +- Og Spinning Detonation

Hitherto we have dealt with the case of a 2CO + O, “spinning” detonation
which is characterized by a comparatively low flame-speed of 1760 m/sec, and
marked instability of the association between the highly radiating flame-front
and the “shock wave” immediately ahead of it. It therefore seemed of importance to
examine also the case of a CH, + O, explosion. The peculiar interest of this lies
in the fact that, while a pronounced “ spin”’ is developed even during the pre-
detonation stage at flame-speeds exceeding 1200 m/sec with a frequency of about
68,000 per second in a tube of 13 mm internal diameter, on detonation the frequency
is abruptly increased to about 110,000 per second with concurrent abrupt increase
in the flame-speed to about 2600 m/sec. Also in such detonation a “ double spin”
(due to two spiralling “ heads”) may also be developed. According to our view of detonation, this would betoken a less attenuated flame-
front and closer association between it and the ‘‘shock wave” than in a 2CO + O,
detonation.
