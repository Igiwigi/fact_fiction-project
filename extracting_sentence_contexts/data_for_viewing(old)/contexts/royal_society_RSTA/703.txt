SERS was useful in the identification of cobalt blue and indigo in the Y4-19 and Y4-20 region
respectively. It was not possible to characterize the Y4-18 reference by Raman spectroscopy, but
the XRF analysis of this area shows the presence of Co, K and Si, characteristic elements of smalt.

(e) Green and black colours

Copper resinate (Y4-21), malachite (Y4-22) and green earth (Y4-23) were employed in the green
areas, while the black pigments were carbon black (Y4-24) and noir de vigne (Y4-25). The use of
532, 785 and 1064nm lasers proved unsuccessful for the identification of green pigments.

The application of SERS yielded good results only in one of the three green areas, assigned
to the green earth. However, the Y4-23 spectrum contains bands at 1190, 1289 and 1545 cm!
(figure 9), which may be related to the presence of phthalocyanine green [27]. In fact, the XRF
spectra of this area revealed the occurrence of Cu, also related to this pigment. Both findings
indicate that some phthalocyanine green was probably mixed with the green earth.

The identification of copper resinate (Y4-21) and malachite (Y4-22) was achieved only by XRF.
Carbon black from Y4-24 area was easy to identify by SERS, as observed in the spectrum of
figure 9, where the bands at 1327cm~! and 1595cm~! can be assigned to the G and D bands
