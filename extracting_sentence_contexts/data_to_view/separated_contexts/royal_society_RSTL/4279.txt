The function Y'A will be of the degree 09 and of the
weight 4 (m0—p)+s. And it is clear that in the series of terms YA, Y*A, Y*A, &c.,
we must at last come to a term which is equal to zero. In fact, since m is the
greatest weight of any coefficient, the weight of Y* is at most equal to md, and there-
fore if 4 (ml—p)+s>md, or 8>4(m0+þp), we must have Y'A=0.
