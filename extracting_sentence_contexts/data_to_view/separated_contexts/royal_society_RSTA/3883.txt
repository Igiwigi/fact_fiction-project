Many earthquakes were felt
about that time along the chain of the Greater Antilles, On January 22nd there
were several shocks in Havana; others were felt in Cienfuegos, San Diego, and
Santiago, and the town of San Cristobal was almost destroyed.} From December 21st,
1879, to January 10th, 1880, there was seismic disturbance in San Salvador, and on
February 5th several earthquakes were reported from Mexico.} The eruption of Montagne Pelée in 1851 was perhaps connected with the great
earthquake which shook Chili on April 2nd of that year.§

Humsotpr has given many interesting facts to confirm his hypothesis that
earthquakes and volcanic activity in this region go hand in hand. In 1692 Port
Royal, in Jamaica, was destroyed, and the volcano of St. Kitts was in eruption. In
1766 there was a violent earthquake in Cumana, Venezuela, and many shocks were
felt in Jamaica, Trinidad, and the Lesser Antilles.
