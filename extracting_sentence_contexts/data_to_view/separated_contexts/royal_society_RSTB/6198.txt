The shorter these are, the more
likely they are to be pulled apart in the jostling movements which clearly take place
during prophase and metaphase. Chiasmata may also occur between these short
paired ends ; but their numbers will be very few compared with the numbers which
have been assumed to form and terminalize along the whole length of the
chromosomes. It may be pointed out here that the high frequency of non-disjunction in all the
catenated Oenotheras, leading to a high frequency of trisomic mutations, appears to
be a direct result of the fact that the bivalents are not paired throughout their length
but that each catenated chromosome is attached at its ends to two others. The nature of catenation

Linkage of chromosomes in diakinesis and first metaphase is now known to occur
not only in Oenothera and Datura but in a number of other genera. It can be
induced in Datura by crossing “B” races with a standard line (BELLING and
BLAKESLEE, 1926).
