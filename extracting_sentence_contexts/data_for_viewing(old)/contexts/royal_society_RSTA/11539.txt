fore not the magnetic force, but matter, or some property of matter when under the
influence of magnetic force, that causes the rotation ; and the property of matter under
the influence of magnetic force is not force, but magnetisation.

Denoting the components of the imposed magnetisation by (a, Bo, yo), we assume

(m1 M2 Ns) = Coe* (% Bos Yo) oR a egrar ad e (OU)

where Ce is the complex magneto-optic constant of the theory. For any particular
metal the values of C, and « may be determined by experiment ; and if-we find that
the numerical values of these constants, as determined by all the different sorts of
experiments, are the same, we shall conclude that the theory can account for all the
observed facts, and therefore constitutes a complete mathematical explanation of the
phenomena.

The Optic Constants of Metals.

13. The constants R and a are different for different metals, and also for light of
different colours, Their values have not been directly tabulated, but they are easily
obtained from the tabulated values of Drupr’s optic constants; these latter are
denoted by 7 and k, and are connected with R and a by the relations

R cos 2a = n® (1 — #), Rsin 2a = — 2n*k,
so that
R=r(1+), . tana=—k,
