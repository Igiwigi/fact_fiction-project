srescentic paocess of the tripus. As the contraction of these muscles must evidently
have the effect of limiting the violent excursions of the tripades whieh miglit other-
wise take place when the anterior chamber is forcibly compressed by the contraction
of ils compressor muscles, we have suggested for each the nme of “ tensor tripodis,”

Au “clastic-spring” apparatus, provided with powerful protractor muscles, bas
already been described by Jonanxes Mttier us existing to the Sovth American
genera eluchenipierus, Dovas, and Evanemus, and in the Afviean Siluroids Synodoutis
aud Mealupterurus. To this list our investigations enable us to add the South
Aiericin form Oydores brevis, and the East Indian species Pangasivs Biches,
P.ihanbal, 2. juve, and P. macroneme. The absence of this mechanism in one
species of Pungusins, viz, £. mivronenea, while present in all the remaining species
of the genus that came onder our notice, ie an interesting and noteworthy fact.

Two points in connection with this apparatus may be noted, fist, the reception
of the outer margins of the tripedes into grooves between the terminal plates and
theiv flexible and elastic roots, whereby the forcihle compression of the airbladder
whieh follows the recoil of the plates. is prevented from imparting » too violent shock
to the Weberian ossicles and the fluids of the internal ear; secondly, the geographical
distribution of these fishes in which the mechanism is present, affords an additional
instance of the singular and exceptional resemblances that have been noted between
the South Awetiean, African, and Bast Indian finds.

The extent to which those species with an ‘elastie-spring” mechanism differ from
other &. normales is subject to some variation. Thus, in Malupternrus, Pougasius
