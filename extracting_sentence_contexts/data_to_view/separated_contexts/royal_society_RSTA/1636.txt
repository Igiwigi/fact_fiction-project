Photographs of the Stream Lines. Considerable difficulty was experienced in obtaining satisfactory photographs of the
phenomenon because when eosin was used instead of fluorescene a more concentrated
solution was necessary ; and it was found difficult to make up this solution so that its .
density remained the same as that of water when it was surrounded by water. It
frequently happened in fact that the coloured liquid formed two columns, one going up
and the other down, when strong eosin solution mixed with alcohol was used. In
spite of this and other difficulties some fairly good photographs were obtained. Fig. 9, Plate 4, shows the appearance of the films shortly after their formation.
