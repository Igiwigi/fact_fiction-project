mum quantity of spermatozoa necessary to effect impregnation, and to draw some
comparison between the results obtained by myself and certain of the more remark-
able ones by SPaLLaNzantF. It then seemed to me, that although the general results
obtained were in accordance with SPALLANZANT's, yet that a larger proportion of fluid,
and consequently a greater quantity of spermatozoa, was required than was supposed
by him. I have, therefore, made further investigation on this subject, and have
Q 80ught to obtain some knowledge of the quantity really necessary to fecundate the
© egg. PrevosrT and Dumas formerly made a similar attempt}, and M. QuaTREFaGEs
Z has recently done the sameF. The results of the observations by PrevosT and Dumas,
S QuarreFaces,and myself, although differing greatly in detail, coincide with the general
5 results obtained by SyaLLanzant,—that only an exceedingly small quantity of seminal
A influence, and consequently only a very limited number of vibratile spermatozoa is
=D necessary to effect impregnation. They agree, too, in the fact that the number of

£ eggs impregnated is always much fewer than that of the spermatozoa supplied to

S them; and, consequently, that there is reason to think that fecundation is not the

result of a single, isolated spermatozoon, although it has not been ascertained what
-2 is the number actually required. The course I have pursued in putting this curious
Z question to the test, has been different from that of either of the distinguished

5 naturalists mentioned. It has not been that of diluting the impregnating fluid in a

8 very large quantity of water, and then applying a minute drop of the water to the
