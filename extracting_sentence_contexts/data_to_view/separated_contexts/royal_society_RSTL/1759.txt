Of the Irritability. The single fact of a power of sustaining the privation of air, without loss of
life, leads alone to the inference that the irritability is greatly augmented in
the state of hyhernation. This inference flows from the law s0 fully stated in
my former paper, and the fact is one of its most remarkable illustrations and
confirmations. It might have been inferred from these premises, that the beat of the heart
would continue longer after decapitation in the state of hybernation, than in
the state of activity in the same animal ; an inference at once most singular
and correct. This view receives the fullest confirmation from the following remarkable

experiment: On March the 9th, s0on after midnight, I took a hedgehog which
had been in a state of uninterrupted lethargy during 150 hours, and divided
the spinal marrow just below the occiput ; I then removed the brain and de-
stroyed the whole spinal marrow as gently as possible.
