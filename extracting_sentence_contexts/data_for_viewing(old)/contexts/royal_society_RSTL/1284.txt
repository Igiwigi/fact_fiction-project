Dr. WiLL1am HuNTER; but in what manner the embryo breaks
its amnion, and opens a communication with the uterus, is a
question on which Dr. HunTE is silent : indeed it is one that
could not be touched upon till it was ascertained that the
ovum, when it arrived at the uterus, was completely enclosed
in the amnion.

Having been the first to ascertain that curious fact, and
having arrived at that knowledge through the microscopical
observations of Mr. Bave, I am peculiarly gratified, that the
same powers, exerted in another correspondent investigation,
Should have enabled me to give the solution.

In the ovum of the hen, the rudiments of the embryo re-

case there is a necessity for a communication between the
blood vessels of the embryo and the source of their blood's
