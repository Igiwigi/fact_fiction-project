Uj = f (x1) + mto(X1) + Bih(Xo).

Based on this model and some general assumptions about dis-
tributional and efficiency preferences (see model predictions in the
electronic supplementary material), the behavioural predictions
for neutral group pairings are straightforward and as follows:
given the same co-decision-maker, taking money from an out-
group victim is weakly preferred over taking money from an
ingroup victim. Likewise, given an ingroup victim, taking together
with an ingroup co-decision-maker is weakly preferred over taking
together with an outgroup co-decision-maker. Notice that the
higher the concerns for ingroup members in the group, the lower
the expropriation rate of ingroup members. The fact that people
care more about their ingroup members’ welfare than their
outgroup members’ welfare then gives the following proposition.

Prediction 2.1. Group constellations ordered according to
predicted expropriation rates are:

Out-In < In-In < min{Out-Out, In-Out}.
