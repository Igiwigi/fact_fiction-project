Finally, I notate the
character value of the offspring of parent i by z; = 2; + Azi, where Az; simply describes how parent and offspring differ
and we impose no constraints on whether this quantity is positive or negative or zero. Where a parent has multiple offspring
that vary in their character value, one can interpret z;' as an average taken over the brood. With these definitions in place, the difference between the average trait value of the parent and offspring aggregates is
AE e1(2)) = Eier(@')) — Ese (2) = 0 /2/ — S021 = Do aitwil@i + Axi) — YO gis = 0 gitwizs — S3 giz + YO giv iz

jel iel iel il iel iel iel

= Ejer (wj2i) — Eier (wj)Eier Zi) + Eier @ujAzi)

where, in the final line, I have made use of the fact that Eje; (w;) = 1. Noting that Eje; (w;z;) — Ejer (w;)Eier (Z;) = Covier (Wj,2)),
I arrive at equation (2.1) of the main text

AE jer (Zi) = Covier (w;,2i) + Eier WjAzi). Price’s equation expresses overall evolutionary change as the sum of a ‘selection’ term AcEj</(z;) = Covje(w;,z;) and a
‘transmission’ term AyEj<)(z;) = Eje(w;Az;).
