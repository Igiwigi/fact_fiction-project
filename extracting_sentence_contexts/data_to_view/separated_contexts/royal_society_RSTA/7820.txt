The pattern gis shown in fig. 9, taken at a greater
speed. Thus the order of appearance of the patterns e, f and g is determined. Tt is seen that the transverse rolls are not part of the scheme; the fact that they
were generated independently and could not be transformed from anything else confirms
this ; there is also the fact that at a speed of 0-5 cm./sec., both the transverse rolls and
the pattern b were obtainable according to whether the pattern started ab initio or
whether it started from a. The transverse rolls appear, therefore, to occupy a unique
position in the series of patterns. The fact that the transverse rolls have not yet been
obtained in a liquid lends further support to the statement.
