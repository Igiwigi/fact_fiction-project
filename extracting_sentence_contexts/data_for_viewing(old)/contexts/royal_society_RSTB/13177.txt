the strong feature-based condition (Bonferroni correction for
multiple comparisons; attention template: p=0.003, weak:
p =0.067, strong: p = 0.039; figure 3b). Additionally, the only
significant difference across the attention conditions within
a group was for aphantasic participants when comparing
strong attention stimuli priming with that of attention
templates (p = 0.026, all other p > 0.294).

These data demonstrate that aphantasic participants
show no evidence of having attentional templates; however,
they still retain some ability to attend to features when
perceptually presented, with priming above chance in the
full-strength feature-based attention condition. The fact that
aphantasic individuals do not show above-chance priming
in the attention condition indicates that attentional templates
are very similar to visual imagery and are different in
some way from standard feature-based attention. It should
be noted that priming in aphantasic individuals for the full-
strength feature-based attention condition is above chance,
but significantly lower than controls (although this was
not the case in experiment 2). These results highlight the
possibility that in participants with imagery there may
be multiple mechanisms (imagery plus feature-based atten-
tion) at play when attending to full-strength stimuli. Our
next experiment (experiment 4) aimed to further assess the
