342 Mr. HaTonrTT's Analysis

In the mineral kingdom, a great variety of substances, and
even some of the gems, exert a feeble degree of attraction on
the magnetic needle, and sometimes also acquire a slight degree
of polarity;* but, as this wonderful property has only been
observed conspicuously powerful in one species of iron ore, this
has been always emphatically called the Magnet, and is said
to consist of metallic jron combined with from 10 to 20 per
cent. of oxygen.

From the facts, however, which have been recently stated, we
now find that there is another natural substance, apparently
very difterent from the magnet in chemical composition, but
nevertheless approaching very nearly to it in power, which is
found in several parts of our globe, and particularly in a pro-
vince of this kingdom, where it constitutes a vein, running
north and south, of considerable extent, and several yards in
width and thickness. -

From the experiments also, which have been made on the
artificial preparation of this substance, we find, that it is capable
of receiving. the magnetic properties when the proportion of
sulphur amounts to g7 per cent. and is till powerfully attracted
