of nitrogen ; and the moderately fat one,
- only about 14 per cent. The striking fact of there being s0 s8mall a percentage of nitrogen in the bodies of the
- mnimals which we feed to supply our meat-diet, is one of great interest and importance. - On the one hand, as will be fully illustrated further on, the proportion of the nitrogen
2onsumed in the fattening food, which remains stored up in the animal, and is sent to
market as meat, is extremely small ; and on the other, as already alluded to, a consider-
Shle proportion of the nitrogen which really is retained by the animals is not appro-
gSpriated as human food ; whilst, of that which is 80 appropriated, a considerable portion
Spill exist in the form of gelatin and chondrin-yielding matters, the value of which as
70d is, to say the least, questioned. Â£ Before leaving the Tables showing the percentage of nitrogen in the different animals
Rnd their several parts, attention may be recalled to the illustrations of the latter point,
afforded in the lines of mean percentages, given at the foot of Table VI.
