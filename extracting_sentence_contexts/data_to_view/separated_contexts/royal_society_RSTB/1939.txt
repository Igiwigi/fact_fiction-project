The different
assumptions which have been made in discussing the question necessitate this: the
general problem will however be dealt with only so far as to define the author's
position on some points on which a clear understanding is necessary, although in the
present state of our knowledge they must be regarded as working assumptions

â€œmerely. The views entertained with regard to some of these questions profoundly
affect the value to be attached to some phenomena, among which those discussed in
this paper are included. It may be as well to state at the outset that only the facts
of alternation seen in Archegoniates and some of the Green Algze will be considered. The gain in clearness justifies the limitation of comparisons to organisms, some of
which may be presuined to represent more or less accurately steps through which
the ancestors of Bryophyta and Pteridophyta may have passed. The nature of the problem may be thus stated.
