From the same values of «# and y we could, of course, infer w = ‘125, so the
theorem may be expressed in words thus—- “In any case where cross-equality* and independence both subsist for the second-
order frequencies, independence must subsist for two at least of the four positive
third-order frequencies if either (1) the sum of the remaining two is equal to 4th or
8ths of the total frequency ; or (2) the difference between the remaining two is equal
to 4th of the total frequency.” T should, perhaps, note that in the present case the fact that the criterion of
independence holds for the positive fourth-order class necessitates its holding for all
the remaining classes of the aggregate. This is not so in general. It may further
be remarked that the independence of the attributes, pair and pair in the second-
order classes, does not connote independence for the groups of the third order, I
hope to return to the logic of independence on a future occasion.
