Among the Zoantharia, the greater number of forms agree with the Alcyonaria in
developing as solid delaminate planule in which the gastric cavity is formed by the
absorption of a central yolk-mass. A few forms, on the other hand, viz. : Cerianthus
(KowALEvs8KY, JOURDAN), Actinia equina L. (JoURDAN), and perhaps an allied Actinia,
and probably Caryophyllium (KowALEvsKY), develop as invaginate gastrule. BALFouR
states, on the authority of KLEINENBERG, that in 8ome of the apparently delaminate
types the segmentation is unequal, which © probably indicates an epibolic gastrula.”
While the occurrence of epibolic gastrulz among these forms is by no means improbable,
it eannot be accepted on this evidence alone ; for the segmentation of Renilla shows that
such an inference may be entirely false.

It is a curious fact that in two at least of the invaginate forms, viz. : Acting equind
(JourDAN), and Cerianthus (KOwALEVSKY), a yolk-mass is formed in the gastric
cavity some time after the invagination has occurred, though no traces of it exisb in *
earlier 8tages. Thus, of the former species JoURDAN states : * Lſespace entre les
cloisons es toujours occup6 par une masse probablement vitelline, et qu'on croirait
exsud6e des tissns de la larye; cette masse nutritive es form6e par de grosses
vesicules semblables 2 des cellules adipeuses et par des noyaux fortement color6s par
les reactifs,”* KowALevsky regards the yolk-mass of Cerianthus as a gecretion of
the deeper layers of the entoderm, and considers its elements as fat globules. In
both cases the yolk-mass is eventually resorbed. If the origin of the yolk-mass
is correctly described by these eminent observers, it is clearly not homologous with

that of the Alcyonarian forms. ;
