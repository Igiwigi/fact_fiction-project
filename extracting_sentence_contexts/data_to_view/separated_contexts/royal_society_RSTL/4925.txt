Are the tentacles the scene
ofa double respiratory process, by which the blood-proper and the chylaqueous fluid
are atrated simultaneously? Analogy renders it certain that the integuments of these
genera, like the Sipunculidans, are * fenestrated,‚Äù and that with express view to the
a&ration of the contents of the visceral cavity. These inquiries have thas placed in
clear light the interesting fact, that there prevails but one essential type or plan of Struc-
ture in the integumentary system of all Echinoderms, and that the blood-proper may
have its own respiratory apparatus, or that it may be atrated through the medium of
or by the chylaqueous fluid, itse{f having first received oxygen from the surrounding
element. The Entozoa constitute, really, the true commencement of the Annelida in the
rest. At present I will only commit myself to the statement, that in the fluid of the peritoneal cavity of the
Sipunculidz the germ-cell-like bodies are veritable ova, and the sperm-cells are veritable spermatozoa.

Sions, established by Professor Owen under the appellations of Ccelel- and Sterelmintha,
are distinguished from each other by a deep line of demarcation, two great classes of
Entozoa which differ in organization far more remarkably than any heiminthologist
has ever yet supposed.
