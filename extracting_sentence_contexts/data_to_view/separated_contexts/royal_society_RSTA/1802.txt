The effect of a large admixture of Hydrogen is again, as in Helium, directly
contrary to the effect of a small trace just discussed. There is an actual enhancement
‘of the members of higher term number in the series. There remains the necessity of verifying the fact that the Sharp series of Parhelium
presents no exceptional features, and of observing from a consideration of Hydrogen
lines emitted in the presence of Helium in these experiments—they have been
observed in presence of Neon in an earlier communication—the simultaneous
effect on the lighter component of the mixture. For consideration of the Sharp series of Parhelium we have calculated, reducing \5047
to intensity 10 in each case, the following intensities of the next member, \4437 :—

4487, intensity 7°87 in the ordinary spectrum, 7'2 with a trace of Hydrogen, and
6°03 with more Hydrogen. The reduction of the second member by a trace of
Hydrogen is again evident, though not very strongly.
