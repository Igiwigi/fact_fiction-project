MR. FRANCIS DARWIN ON STOMATA. 567

It will be noticed that a slight fall in the hygroscope readings follows the shaking
in Sagittaria ; whether this corresponds to the physical effect produced with pieces
of bread I cannot say. The question seems hardly worth the labour which an answer
would require.

§10. Execrric Srrmunarion.

N. J. C. MétiEr* showed that induction shocks produée closure of the stomata.
It is easy to control the fact on the leaves of Callitriche, or the stripped epidermis of
Ranunculus Ficaria.t The further question as to the mode of action of the shock is
‘pot SO easy.
"g Lerrarst assumes that the effect is simply due to death or injury of the stoma.
Blectric shocks which visibly affected the circulation in the guard cells did not close
@hem. If the stomata were made to close, they never opened again. But MULLER
Sbserved reopening after partial closure of the stomata.
2 In the following experiments it will be shown that a weak shock produces an
gpening of the stomata, while a stronger one closes them. Lerrexs (loc. cit., p. 144)
Bugesgts that such an effect might be produced by an electric shock diminishing the
Surgor of the surrounding epidermis, and thus lessening the pressure on the guard
Bells, but it does not appear that he observed any such effect.
a In my experiments I used a Leclanché cell and Ruhmkoff coil, and electrodes of
