The most important generalisations derivable from our study of the relation between
current strength and concentration of different sets of salts of different metals are
first, that the conductivities differ always according to the metal; secondly, that
among salts of the same metal differences of conductivities evident at high concen-
trations disappear when the dilution is greater ; and thirdly, that the conductivity of
haloid salts is different from the conductivity of oxysalts. We will give the explanation of these general facts, which appears to be most in
conformity with our results, and most compatible with chemical evidence. The fact that the conductivity of haloid salts at higher concentrations is approxi-
mately proportional to the square root of the concentration is consistent with the
presence of a binary electrolyte, and as we have found that the conductivity of
chlorides is maintained when the presence of a large quantity of chloroform in the
flame forbids us to suppose that the chlorides are chemically altered, we conclude that. the binary electrolyte in question is the haloid salt itself. Again, the approximately equal conductivity of the oxysalts of any one metal which
approaches that of the hydrates, indicates that in the flame they are changed into the
same electrolysable substance, which we conclude is the hydroxide or oxide.
