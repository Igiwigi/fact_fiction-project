Table XXIII. This result is favourable to the view that the difference is not purely
fortuitous, but betokens some physical connection.

The marked rise in the mean of the second column, as compared to that of the first
column in Table XXV., is also distinctly favourable to this view. On the other
hand, the mean for the seventh column is nearly as large numerically as those for
columns 8 to 10, and larger than the means for columns 11 and 12. This is equivalent

to the effect occurring 24 hours in advance of the cause. An explanation may, to
some extent, be forthcoming from the fact that there is a tendency for days of large
range and of small range to occur in groups. This tendency is, however, markedly
less than the corresponding tendency in the case of sunspot areas already alluded to
(a difference of significance in itself), and it is unusual to have more than two or three
successive days on which the ranges are all markedly greater or markedly less than
the mean for the month.
