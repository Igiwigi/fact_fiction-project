case of sharp measurements, one can always assume that the response functions &(k|A, M) take 6 |

only values 0 or 1, i.e. they are deterministic functions of A [24]. As a consequence, one can restate

the KS conditions of equation (2.1) in the language of measurement-non-contextual ontological 3

models as [3S
Ei, ME(jIA, M)=0 for ix; :g

and Yella M)=1. (3.4) 2

The situation changes, however, when measurements are not sharp. In fact, it has been proven :2
that, due to the statistical identification above, one can no longer assume the response functions 18
are deterministic. A rigorous proof has been provided in [24], the intuitive explanation is the &
following. Given a POVM effect E, consider its spectral decomposition >; i/7;, where the :ยง
eigenvalues j; satisfy 0 < 4; <1. The projectors {/7;}, then, form another measurement, from :B
which E can be obtained via classical postprocessing. Measurement non-contextuality, then, 2
implies that the response function associated with the effect E must be given by the same i>
post-processing of the response functions associated with {J1;}, since both procedures, i.e. the [=
measurement of the effect E or the post-processing of the effects {/7;}, give the same statistics. :8

As a consequence, the above approach is not straightforwardly applicable to experimental : >
procedures, since in any practical implementation of a measurement noise is unavoidable. This : Ss
result motivated the development of different notions of contextuality and different approaches Do
