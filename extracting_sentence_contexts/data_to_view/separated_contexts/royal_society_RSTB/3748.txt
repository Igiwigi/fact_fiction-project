Summary and Conclusions. The points which I have endeavoured to bring forward in support of my view of
the nature of the tubes in marsupial enamel are chiefly the following :—

The evidence that calcification takes place in the prisms previously to the calcifica-
tion of the cement substance, already more or less completely calcified prisms being
arranged in laminze and lying in a distinct fibrillar organic matrix substance which
can, in some cases, be seen in calcified enamel. The fact that spherical calcified bodies are found upon these laminz where they
can be seen to be undergoing disintegration. The presence in Bettongia of terminal bulb-shaped bodies, which form the termina-
tions of dentinal tubes deep in the enamel, and the presence in the enamel tubes of
the same stain and granular particles seen in the tubes in the dentine, in specimens in
which the soft parts have been fixed. The free injection of the enamel tubes with alcoholic fuchsin from the pulp cavity,
the stain passing not only into the tubes, but also into portions of the matrix substance
which have escaped calcification.
