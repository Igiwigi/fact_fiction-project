Helicity corresponds to topological properties of the flows and : =
fields, through knots, links, twists and writhes [6,8,9], and their entanglement. Helicity is a pseudo :3
(axial) scalar, since it can change sign upon change of a reference frame from right-handed to left- : =
handed. This corresponds to the (similar) fact that, in a Serretâ€”Frenet frame describing a string in 2k
three-dimensional space, the torsion is pseudo scalar, the line being able to exit the plane formed [3
by the tangent and curvature to the string, upward or downward. :s

Helicity appears to play a role in disparate areas of research beyond fluid dynamics and :8
plasmas, from DNA and bio-chemistry to meta-materials [10]. It is also involved in the problem of : Ss
entanglements of vortex lines in quantum fluids [11]. Yet another instance is the orientation of the 7k

swimming motions of simple biological systems, with possible applications to nanotechnology:
chiral behaviour basically allows for more complex three-dimensional motions and thus to follow
physical gradients, e.g. of nutrients.
