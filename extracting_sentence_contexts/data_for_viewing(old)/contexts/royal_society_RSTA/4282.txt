good qualitative information about the features of the system, capturing the spontaneous
wrapping phenomenon [11] and predicting the instant encapsulation threshold [23] that is also
present, yet not explicitly mentioned, in other similar systems [5]. However, the downside is
that none of the reduced set-ups appropriately capture three-dimensional scenarios, resulting
in inaccurate quantitative predictions. As a consequence, there is a need for the development of
three-dimensional models that take into account a full description of plate elasticity.

In this article, we begin the process of developing such a model. Neglecting the effect of
gravity, we assume capillary origami configurations are minimizers of an appropriate energy
functional containing only the interfacial energies of the drop and the deformation energy of
the sheet. Interfacial energies form the basis of the theory of capillary surfaces and come with
a well-developed set of tools [26]. The handling of the deformation energy is more problematic
and has been the focus of numerous recent studies (e.g. [27-31]). The difficulty lies in the fact
that the energy is composed of two parts: a non-convex in-plane stretching term penalizing
deviations from a flat metric and a convex out-of-plane bending term involving both the mean
and Gaussian curvatures. When the thickness of the sheet limits to zero, the resulting equilibrium
shape involves only bending from the initial configuration [32], and the plate can thus be locally
described as a developable surface. Imposing the isometric constraint becomes difficult due to
its degenerate and point-wise nature. Our present approach consists of avoiding this problem by



allowing for bending using a FÃ©ppl-von Karman ansatz, and should thus be viewed as a first
step towards the description of the three-dimensional encapsulation process. Indeed, although
the ansatz discussed here is not expected to be valid for the large deformations that are needed
