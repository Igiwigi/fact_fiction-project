ditional forms of political activism in Western democracies focus on winning
power and support through conventional means provided by the political
system, these emerging forms of activism seek to disrupt the existing system

institutions rather than build them.

Prior research links current-day disruptive activism to experiences of
social marginalization [8] and rising economic inequality [7]. At the same
time, however, not everyone who feels marginalized has a desire to ‘watch
the world burn’. In fact, an emerging line of research suggests that these
highly disruptive sentiments, referred to as a Need for Chaos, are contingent
on a particular set of psychological dispositions: an intense desire for social
