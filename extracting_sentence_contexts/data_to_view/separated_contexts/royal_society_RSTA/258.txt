21. In these circumstances the following procedure is indicated: Start with values
estimated as above from the boundary values of w, dw/dx, dw/dy without allowance for
higher differentials; carry liquidation a little way on the basis of these starting values;
then correct them in the light of the evidence so obtained. For example, if values
Wx W,, Wy, are obtained by a partial liquidation, a rough plotting (figure 8) shows that
the curve of w which passes through E and F (viz. KLMEF) will not in fact touch EF
at D: consequently the correct curve may be expected to have a form of the kind shown
in dotted lines through KLmeDf, and the modified values given by M'm, Ae, Cf may be
taken as a basis for further liquidation in which points A and C are not relaxed. By this means
greater advantage can be taken of coarse nets in the early stages. Ficure 8
