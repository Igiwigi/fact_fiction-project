GASKELL
S concerned himself with efferent visceral fibres only ; he compared the function and the
£ histological characters of a considerable number of nerves, and pointed out that in all
% these cases the nerves which had visceral functions contained many small nerve-fibres,
so that there was good ground for believing that efferent visceral nerves are always
5 small. GAsKELL gives 1°8 to 3°6 « as the diameter of these nerve-fibres.
= . The theory of Broper and Vorkmany, that the large fibres of the sympathetic
3 system are fibres of general sensibility, seemed to me, at first sight, as satisfactory as
q it was simple, and I was the more inclined to adopt it because of some facts connected
& with the cervical sympathetic. Bupcr and Water found that stimulation of the
a cervical sympathetic in an unaneesthetised Rabbit caused no sign of pain. I have on
several occasions made special experiments on the anzsthetised Rabbit and Cat, with
the object of determining whether stimulation of the central end of the cervical sympa-
thetic causes a reflex of any kind, I have not observed any certain reflex, neither body
movement, nor variation of blood-pressure, nor change in rate of respiration or heart-
beat, nor alteration in the pupil or arteries of the opposite side of the head.
