the more volatile propyl nitrites are far more active than the much less volatile
jso-primary amyl nitrite, which is one of the weakest members of the series. It is
clear that volatility is not the most important of the factors which lead to the
modification in physiological action. Although there are certain well marked irregu-
larities in the order, if we have regard to the strongest nitrites, viz., those of iso-butyl,
tertiary amyl, and secondary butyl, and to the weakest compounds, viz., the nitrites of
methyl and ethyl, it appears that, for the most part, the power of contracting muscular
fibre is associated with high molecular weight, and is not conditioned by the quantity
of nitroxyl which the nitrite contains.
a Iso-butyl nitrite, the strongest member of the series, represents less than half the
mantity of nitroxyl contained in an equal weight of methyl nitrite, which is the
est of all the compounds. This fact, taken in conjunction with the high place
ecupiod by the secondary and tertiary compounds, points to the conclusion that
Zehemical instability is here again the principal determining condition of physiologica!
Stetivity.
5 Tn relation to the rapidity with which muscular contraction is effected as dis-
TBiguiched from its extent, quite different nitrites prove themselves to be the most
SPflicient. The order in which the nitrites are arranged, according to the increasing
te at which they produce muscular contraction, is as follows :â€”
