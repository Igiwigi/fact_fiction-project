the ampere to a very high degree of accuracy. In fact, this unit is now known with
a precision considerably greater than any other electrical quantity of which absolute
measurements have been made.

Section 2.—GENERAL Description.

The instrument consists of a very sensitive physical balance supporting a coil with
vertical axis from each end of the beam, these coils hanging coaxially within fixed
coils carried from the base of the balance. A diagrammatic sketch of the arrangement
is shown in fig. 1, and a view of the complete instrument in fig. 2, Plate 7.

From the former it will be seen that the current flows in opposite directions in
the upper and lower parts of the outer coils, On the left-hand side of fig. 1 the
