an investment of enamel, partial or complete, but that cementum is only present in a
few instances.

The only reptilian teeth which are really coated with cementum, 80 far as T am aware,
are those which are implanted in more or less complete sockets or in a groove. Thus the
teeth of the Crocodile and of the /ehthyosaurus have cementum upon their basal portions;
but whether the inference that cementum is in all cases associated with implantation
in sockets will be borne out by a more extended series of obseryations, T cannot as yet
with certainty say.

In proof of my statement that the thin outer layer upon Ophidian teeth is enamel,
the following facts may be advanced :—

Its refractive index is high, s0 that it resembles enamel and does not resemble
cementum. It is very brittle*, 80 that it is often entirely lost in grinding down a thin
section, and is invariably much cracked when it does remain 7 8i7u (se Plate 48. fig. 1).

The application of acids to the sections wholly removes it, whereas cementum is even
less affected by acids than is dentine.

But what is more conclusive than all is its development ; it is formed from the
elongated cells of a perfectly characteristic and unmistakable enamel-organ, to be
presently described—a fact which alone would put it beyond all doubt that enamel
is present on the teeth of Ophidia, and that therefore cementum is not.
