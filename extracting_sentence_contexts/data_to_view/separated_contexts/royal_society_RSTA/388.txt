To test this experi-
mentally the surface temperature was measured by the thermoelectric method, as
described in earlier papers. Figure le shows the results obtained for constantan sliding
on steel with paraffin oil as lubricant. It will be seen that the surface temperature as
well as the frictional force is in fact fluctuating violently during sliding. During the
stick the surface temperature remains sensibly constant, but at the instant a slip occurs
there is a sudden rise and fall in the surface temperature. The whole temperature
flash may be over in less than a thousandth of a second.
