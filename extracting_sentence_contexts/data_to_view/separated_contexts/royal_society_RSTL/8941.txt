Now on the
5 part of the coast where my work has throughout been carried on—viz. the Cromarty
w=] Firth, on the east of Scotland—the Medusz have been this year as scarce as last year
E they were abundant. Probably the cause of this scarcity in the land-locked position
bi occupied by the Cromarty Firth is in part to be attributed to the unusual prevalence
S of westerly winds which has this year been observable in that locality. But whatever
= the cause, the fact of this scarcity having existed has compelled me this year to restrict
= my observations, almost exclusively, to the genera Sarsia, Tiaropsis, and Aurelia. By
Z way of introduction it is only necessary further to state that, for the sake of facilitating
= reference, I shall endeayour to construct the present communication on as nearly as
5 poSible the same general plan as the last one. B=]
