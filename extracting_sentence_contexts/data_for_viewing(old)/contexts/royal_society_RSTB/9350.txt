There is also evidence that synaptic vesicles in DA cells may
contain both dopamine and GABA: as noted above, confocal
microscopy had shown co-localization of VMAT2, VGAT and
GABA in the axonal varicosities of DA cells [22], and we
observed in electron micrographs of retinal cryosections that
both synaptic vesicles and LDCVs were apparently labelled
by antibodies to both transporters.

The relative contents of dopamine and GABA seem to vary
dramatically among different secretory organelles. This is partly
caused by the different sensitivity of the methods used to
measure the size of the released quanta: amperometry is in
fact very sensitive compared to recording current events after
release, diffusion and binding of GABA to its receptors on the
cell surface. Nevertheless, this variability must also reflect
differences in the relative organelle concentration of the two
transmitters. Indeed, some organelles seem to contain a single
vesicular transporter, either VGAT or VMAT2, and others con-
tain both, as demonstrated by immunocytochemistry. We have
suggested previously [48] that the presence of variable numbers
of VMAT2 and VGAT molecules within the membrane of the
synaptic vesicles may result from stochastic sorting of the two
transporters during recycling from the cell membrane. In a
similar manner, the sorting of both VMAT2 and VGAT to
the various secretory organelles in the cell body may be deter-
