hopper, where it occupies a small area beneath the anterior end of the crop. Whether
it persists in the latter instars has not been ascertained. In the late embryonic stages
of Xiphidium (WHEELER, 1893) and of Forficula (Heymons, 1895, a) the cells of this
body become attached to the salivary glands. No such association was observed in
Locusta.

Discussion—The suboesophageal body has been shown to exist in the embryos
of the Orthoptera, the Isoptera, the Rhynchota, and the Lepidoptera. It is usually
of a temporary nature except in Gryllus and the Blattidae where it persists in the
larva (Hrymons, 1895, a), and in the Isoptera where it is present even in the sexually
ripe individuals (HotmGrEN, 1909). It is generally unpaired in origin, but in the
Orthoptera evidence of its paired origin has been produced (Hrymons, 1895, a ;
Wiesmann, 1926 ; Roonwat, present paper). Notwithstanding the fact that the
suboesophageal body shows a strikingly uniform structure and is, in all probability,
homologous in all insects, its origin is remarkably varied. Below are briefly
summarized the various modes of its origin in different insects. They fall into
three main groups, viz. :

(a) Endodermal Origin.

It arises from the anterior endodermal mass—Lepidoptera (ScHwANGaRT, 1904 ;
Hirscuier, 1907 ; JOHANNSEN, 1929) ; Orthoptera (NusBaum and Futinsx1, 1906).
(b) Mesodermal Origin.

(i). From the mesoderm of the intercalary segment—Lepidoptera (EasTHam,
