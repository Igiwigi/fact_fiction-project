“nodule” remained unproved as an individual structure. Kocn instituted a direct
comparison between the microscopic structure of the septal spines in a Paleozoic
genus and that of the * two-leaved” compact septa, both in Cyathophyllum, a Palso-
zoic genus, and in Caryophyllia, a recent Turbinolid. He recognized a distinct area
of indefinite structure in the middle both of “spine” and of ‘‘septum,” and out-
side it a lamellar “‘stereoplasm” of fibrous structure. From that time forward the
view of LinpsrrROM was adopted with more security, and was generalized for the
structure of the septa in Madreporaria of all ages.

The brilliancy of the decade 1872-82 in Zoological Research.

A strong stimulus had been given to the zoological research of Actinozoa by the
embryological works of Lacaze Dursimrs. We may, in fact, regard the decade
1872-82 as a high tide in the zoological literature of corals. The late Professor
Mosenry* was then producing his brilliant series of papers touching various classes
of Coelenterata. His general reports of “Challenger” material appeared in No. II.
of the “Challenger” Expedition volumes, and several papers on special genera
appeared in different magazines. Amongst the most interesting of his researches
were those on dimorphism in the zooids of the Alcyonarian Heliopora cerulea ;t
and again the dimorphism in the families Milleporida and Stylasteride.t He proved
that both those groups, which had been formerly classed with Actinozoa, were in
reality Hydrozoa.

The researches of the Herrwics}{ gave insight into the fine histology of the mus-
culature, the nerve-system, and the generative organs of the Actinians. A couple
