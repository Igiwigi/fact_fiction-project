to p. 153. Dr. Joux Rep (Cyclop. Anat. and Phys. Article Heart, p. 597) has suggested that Saxagr-
RING had Lt Cat's case in view, when he states (De Corp. Humani Fabr. vol. v. P- 340) © rarissime vena
hzc in vena subelavid deatrd finitur,” being probably misled by an inadyertence of HarLen, who, in quoting
the case, has substituted the word © deztram” for * sinistram” (Elem. Physiol. t. i. p. 375, editio 1757), It
may be added, that the termination of the coronary vein in the left subclavian is, as explained in the text,
readily reconcileable with the mode of development.

{ In one instance recorded by Lexairz (Bull. des Scienc. Med. 1808, vol. v. p. 21), two coronary veins are
said to have joined a pulmonary vein, and 80 reached the right auricle ; but the facts seem to bear another
explanation, the pulmonary vein in question being apparently a left $uperior cava descending in its wonted cir-
cuitous course beneath the root of the left lung, and receiving two cardiac veins as usual.
