[ors made. We have no evidence whether such equation exists in comparisons by end-
-Zmeasure, as the whole of the comparisons for the Prussian Standard were made by
ZBra8BL himself. Still it is scarcely doubted that in this respect the system of end-
Smeaures has an advantage. On the other hand, there is no doubt that, by repeating
Ethe measures, and by varying the observers, the errors in line-measures arising from
Erccognized causes will be eliminated, and unexceptionable accuracy will be given to the
Erexults.
& *9. After consideration of all these points, as far as they were known at the time ;
Zremarking, in particular, the freedom of a line-standard from any tendency to constant
Swear, the applicability of a line-standard to our geodetic measures, the facility of com-
Eparing all other measures of a similar construction with a scale carefully subdivided, the
Acireumstance that there exist no means of reproducing the old standard length but by
reference to existing line-measures, and the historical fact that the British standard for
many years past has been a line-standard ; we decided on adopting a line-standard, or
measure @& traits, for the Parliamentary Standard of Length.

*10. The point which next engaged our attention was the material of which the new
Standard of Length should be formed. The qualities required in the material are
invariability and durability. Already we had reason to suspect that bars, which have
received their form by undergoing while cold the violent mechanical operations of ham-
mering, rolling, or drawing, will not preserve an invariable length ; and these suspi-
cions were raised to certainty by Mr. BaiLy's examination of the standard scale which
primd facie appeared to be the most trustworthy representative of the old Imperial
