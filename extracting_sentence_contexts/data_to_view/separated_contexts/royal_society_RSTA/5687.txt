From condition (2a) of definition 2.3, the family {u”} converges to u weakx-L™((0, T); L?(T?)). In
addition, we have F’ — F weak-L1((0,T); L?(T?)) (condition (2b)) and Up > uo strongly in L?(T?)
(this is condition (2c)). Using these facts, and in view of (3.1) it is easy to see that, in order to prove
theorem 2.4, it is enough to show that the weak-« convergence of u’ is, in fact, strong, and that the
energy dissipation term (2.5) vanishes in the limit. Let us begin by addressing strong convergence. Lemma 3.1.
