But the Society being of late years greatly enlarged, and their communications more
numerous, it was thought advisable that a Committee. of their members should be
appointed to reconsider the papers read before them, and select out of them such as
they should judge most proper for publication in the future Transactions ; which was
accordingly done upon the 26th of March, 1752. And the grounds of their choice are,
and will continue to be, the importance and singularity of the snhjects, or the
advantageous manner of treating them ; without pretending to answer for the
certainty of the facts, or propriety of the reasonings contained in the several papers
80 published, which must still res on the credit or judgment of their respective
authors,

It is likewise necessary on this occasion to remark, that it is an established rule of
the Society, to which they will always adhere, never to give their opinion, as a Body,

upon a 8ubject, either of Nature or Art, that comes before them. And therefore the
thanks, which are frequently proposed from the Chair, to be given to the authors of
guch papers as are read at their accustomed meetings, or to the persons through whose
hands they received them, are to be considered in no other light than as a matter of
civility, in return for the respect shown to the Society by those communications. The
like also is to be said with regard to the several projects, inventions, and curiosities of
various kinds, which are often exhibited to the Society ; the authors whereof, or those
who exhibit them, frequently take the liberty to report, and even to certify in the
public newspapers, that they have met with the highest applause and approbation.
