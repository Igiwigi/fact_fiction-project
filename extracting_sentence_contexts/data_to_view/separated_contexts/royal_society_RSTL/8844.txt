S We have pretty clear proof that, when this intense local action is set up, the gases
EV are in a state of violent disturbance, and that waves of pressure pass backwards and
= forwards from one end of the charge to the other, the action occasionally lasting the
EY whole time that the hot is in the bore. In fact, with the rapidly burning, and in a
= less degree eyen with the slower burning powders, motion is communicated to the pro-
EZ Jectile not by a steady, gradually decreasing pressure like the expansive action of steam
H in a cylinder, but by a series of impulses more or less violent. 65 The time during which these intense local pressures act is of course very minute ; but
= ï¬†till the existence of the pressures is registered by the crusher-gauges.
