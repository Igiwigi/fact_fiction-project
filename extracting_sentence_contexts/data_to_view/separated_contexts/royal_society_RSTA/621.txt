There are some other differences of detail between the behaviour of the double
and the more complex field-changes; for example, for distant discharges type C is
comparatively common among the double field-changes but is rare among the more
complex ones. Vor, CCXXXVIIT. A, 36

One of the most striking facts which emerge is that when a complex field-change
accompanies a flash within 3 km. the first perceptible effect is in 80% of cases a
negative change of field. If simple field-changes are included, the proportion of all
observed field-changes due to discharges within 3 km. in which the first detected
change is negative is just over 60Â°%,.
