The equation 4 5 + a (= 7 | =0, is considered by LAGRANGE
in No. g. As this equation was obtained by reasonings which
are independent on the nature of the molecules in the differ-
ence between the spheroid and the sphere, it ought to be true
for all values of the function v' which expresses the thickness
of those molecules. In order to examine this point, LacRancs
$upposes v/ to be a constant quantity; and on this supposition he

finds that in fact the equation & s + a (=] = 0, does not take
Place, but that the true equation is & 5 þ a ( = ==—2r.0.v. Here then there is certainly a great difficulty : for the very
same reasonings which prove + $ þ a (=) = 0, on the sup-

position of LaPLAct that the sphere touches the spheroid at
F2


96 Mr. Ivory on the Method of computing the

the attracted point, will Iikewise prove that the same equation
js true, when the solids do not touch, and when v/ is constant,
or has any other value whatever. At present I shall pass by what is said in.
