After all, there could be intermediate principles
that are derivable in T. Dick de Jongh was the first to investigate this phenomenon: in his doctoral
dissertation [3], he showed that the propositional principles valid in Heyting arithmetic (HA)
under all substitutions are exactly those of propositional intuitionistic logic (IPC). This fact is now
known as de Jongh’s theorem and has sparked fruitful investigations into the logical structure of
intuitionistic arithmetic. A generalization of de Jongh’s theorem would be to consider not only
the propositional principles of HA but also its propositional admissible rules (see definition 2.3). Visser [4] showed that the propositional admissible rules of HA are exactly those of IPC.
