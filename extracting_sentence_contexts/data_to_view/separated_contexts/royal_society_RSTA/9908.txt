Sometimes the two valleys coalesce
by the washing away of the central mass, but quite often the two remain distinct,
as in the case of the Trespé Rivert and Wallibu Dry River to be mentioned
shortly. The fact of this side formation of streams is clear; it is seen in the
ravine just noticed, also in the upper Rozeau, and in several of the plates in
Part 1, where, though not noticed at the time owing to its being then in an early
stage, it is distinctly visible when looked for, but the cause is not so clear. It
appears to be due to the fact that the water from the old slopes in running down
into the original valley meets the soft new ash, and at once turns down along the
valley and so starts the new stream, and it seems likely that the chief cause of its so
turning is that the surface of the deposit tends to be higher along the middle of the
valley than at the sides, the shape of the mass somewhat resembling a glacier, which
it is well known is usually higher in the middle because of the more rapid motion ot
that part. The Wallibu Dry River and Trespé River.—These are two small and short rivers
to the north of and parallel with the lower part of the Wallibu valley, and both run
in deep gorges in the floor of a wide valley bounded on the south by the Wallibu
plateau. In 1902 both these gorges were filled with new ash to the level of the
main valley floor, and the process of re-excavation of one of them is shown in
Part I., Plate 30, fig. 2.
