The ſubjects employed here were aloes,
ſcammony, gamboge, opium, and corroſive ſubli-
mate, In one of theſe experiments, a boy of ele-
ven years were electriſed with his naked feet

ſtanding upon cakes of pitch. Under his feet, and
- upon the pitch, was ſtrewed a large quantity of pow=
der'd ſcammony, fo thick as to prevent his ſkin from
touching the pitch, The ſcammony ſtuck to his feet,
and his ſoles were in a manner cover'd with the pow-
der of this drug. - During the enſuing night and the
next morning, the boy had four copious ſtools, but
without pain or griping. This effect excited ſome debates among the ſo-
ciety, Some were of opinjon, that the purgative
power of the drug manifeſted itſelf by this new me-
thod of a* niniſtration : others accounted for what
had happened, from an alteration in the temperature
of the air, which, from hot and ſerene, had become
ſuddenly cold : ſome again aſcribed it to the waſh-
ing of the boy's feet, which immediately preceded
his electriſation ; others attributed it to the immode-
rate quantity of fruit he had eaten, Tt was more-
over inſiſted upon, that his being acquainted with
what might be expected, might even ſo work upon
his imagination as to produce this effect : but as a
real matter of fact was the object of the debate, it
was thought proper to make a freſh inquiry, without
truſting to conjectures. Three days afterwards there-
fore he was electriſed again with a freſh parcel of ſcam-
mony added to the former, and the operation continued
for the ſame time, and in the ſame manner, as be-
fore ; but this produced nothing. No ſtools follow'd
it, as in the former experiment, But to prevent any
doubts ariling from the above trials, they ſtrongly
electriſed a healthy youth of about fifteen, with pow-
dcr'd gamboge under his naked feet, for forty minutes,

During the operation he felt a great heat in his feef
and legs, and a conſiderable quantity of the gum,
which the heat had ſoftened, ftuck to the ſoles of
his feet ; but this perſon felt no diſturbance in his
ſtomach or bowels, and had: but one ſtool in the
ſubſequent four-and-twenty hoars.
