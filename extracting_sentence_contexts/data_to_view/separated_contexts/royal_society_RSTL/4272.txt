At every variation of the times of observation, and at different epochs with the


308 MR. GLAISHER ON THE THERMOMETRICAL OBSERVATIONS

same times, I determined two mean values, the one from the morning observations,
and the other from the afternoon observations, and compared the difference between
them, with the difference as exhibited in my tables; in nearly all cases the values
thus found were nearly alike; hence it appeared that the corrections apply equally
well to all the years since 1774. Having ascertained this fact, I felt I had the means, to a certain extent, of deter-
mining the quality of the instruments which have been used, as, for the most part,
different instruments were used in the morning and in the afternoon observations,
and also the correctness of the observations generally ; and thus the means of ascer-
taining the value of the results which could be deduced from them. I need not mention all the tests to which I have subjected the observations, but
briefly state that the results were, a conviction on my mind that the instruments had
been uniformly good, that the observations had been faithfully recorded as read from
the instruments, and that very great care had been taken in reading at the times
stated ; the latter circumstance was most satisfactorily proved from the fact of the
results being the «ame when the times of observation have been such that the changes
were rapid, and consequently a small error in the time of reading would have entailed
a considerable error in the results, :

I found however that during the time the maximum and minimum thermometers
were in use, their readings were frequently in defect or excess respectively as com-
pared with those of the other thermometers made during the day, and this was found
to be more frequently the case in the later than in the earlier observations. On ex-
amining farther and bearing in mind that a self-registering thermometer, whose read-
ing is taken once a day only, merely registers the extreme reading which has taken
place in the preceding twenty-four hours, many of the apparent discrepancies vanished,
yet still s0me remain for which I cannot account. I know it has been said that at
times the sun has shone upon, or its reflected rays have impinged upon the maximum
thermometer; but, if this has been the case, I feel certain that it was of rare occur-
rence, and therefore it is not suflicient alone to warrant us in rejecting a long series
of observations: possibly no journal of the weather has been kept for any length of
time, where an attempt has been made to have the instraments properly exposed,
that snch accidents have not happened.
