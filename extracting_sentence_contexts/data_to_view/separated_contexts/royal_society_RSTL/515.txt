This, as I have shewn, is to be had, in the first place, directly
from the sun, by means of a prism applied to its rays ; and, in
the second, we may have it from fires inclosed in stoves, and
from red-hot iron cooled till it can no longer be seen in the
dark. Besides the arrangement in the order of my experiments
which would arise from this division, we have another subject to
consider, For, since the chief design of this paper is to give a
comparative view of the operations that may be performed on
the rays that occasion heat, and of those which we already
know to have been effected on the rays that occasion light, it
will be necessary to take a short review of the latter. I shall
merely select such facts as not only are perfectly well known,
but especially such as will answer the intention of my compa-
rative view, and arrange them in the following order.

1. Light, both solar and terrestrial, is a sensation occasioned
by rays emanating from luminous bodies, which have a power
of illuminating objects; and, according to circumstances, of
making them appear of various colours.

2. These rays are subject to the laws of reflection.

3- They are likewise subject to the laws of refraction.

4 They are of different refrangbility.
