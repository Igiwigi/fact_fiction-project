Furthermore, the obtained fields were considered to
be independent of the FE mesh, i.e. the chosen elements were sufficiently small, so that any further
refinement would not result in notably different displacements. The loading boundary condition
was considered as a distributed pressure pulse with the temporal distribution obtained from an
actual experiment [16]. Rather than simulating the whole experimental set-up, the spalling sample
was modelled by directly applying the loading pulse on the bar—specimen interface based on the
fact it has been numerically shown that two approaches are fairly similar [58]. This is mainly due
to the fact that the dispersion effects of the smoothed wave travelling through small diameter
