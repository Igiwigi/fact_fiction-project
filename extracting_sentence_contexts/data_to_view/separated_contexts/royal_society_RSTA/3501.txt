It hence gives some
© idea as to the manner in which they are formed. Be Such straight boundaries are a strong indication that the portions on either side
= are connected by a twin relation, and the fact is further brought out when we
examine the geometrical relation of the pits on either side. It has been said above
2 that these pits, which are portions of a cubo-octahedron, are placed in a correct
§ direction to the crystalline axes, and are in fact representations in miniature of what
