ON THE GROWTH OF THE OOCYTE IN ANTEDON. 457

the fixing reagent to the nucleolus of the adult egg may be due to a change in the
physical properties of the corticle layers of the nucleolus after the activity of the
latter structure has ceased.

(c) Fate of the Discharged Nucleolar Spherules.â€”The occurrence of discharged
nucleolar spherules in the young oocyte long before there is any obvious indication of
the formation of spherules on the chromatin threads (e.g., fig. 24), their almost
invariable spatial relation to the de-stained area of the nucleolus, and their uniform
behaviour, irrespective of the nature of the fixing reagent (e.g., figs. 54, 55, 57, ete.),
sufficiently clearly distinguish these spherules from those on the chromatin threads.
The fact that the nucleolar spherules are less frequently met with in later than in
earlier stages indicates that they do not accumulate as such within the nucleus.
Equally certain is it that they do not dissolve in the caryolymph, for there is
never, at any period, any trace of nucleolar spherules in course of solution in the
nucleus, although, if such a process occurred, it would necessarily occupy some time.
There remains, therefore, as the only possible fate for the discharged nucleolar
spherules, an immediate passage to the cytoplasm. This cytoplasmic fate for the
nucleolar spherules has been already suggested by fig. 18 and considerable additional
evidence to the same end will be adduced in considering the origin of the yolk
nucleus (p. 466).
