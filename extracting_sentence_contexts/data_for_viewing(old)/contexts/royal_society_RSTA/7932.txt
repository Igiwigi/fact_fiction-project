0-5 cm/sec. rounded cells of fig. 6, were produced and not the transverse rolls.
The formation of the favourable system of polygons depended on chance, but from this
system the rectangular and transitional patterns could be obtained every time.

At a speed of between 1-5 cm./sec. and 2 cm./sec. fairly regular polygons moved
down the channel as shown in fig. 8.

At a speed greater than about 2 cm./sec. the longitudinal rolls of fig. 9, Plate 2,
were formed. In this as in the double shear experiments adjacent rolls rotated in
opposite directions.

The speeds given above are necessarily only approximate, because complete regu-
larity of conditions could not be achieved, in fact, many of the photographs show
two of the patterns at the same time ; these photographs are useful in helping to piece
together’the complete transformation from polygons to longitudinal rolls. This trans-
formation was not achieved experimentally, and was partly due to the fact that the
smoke settled or dispersed too quickly, and to the fact that conditions were not
sufficiently regular.


A. GRAHAM ON SHEAR PATTERNS IN AN UNSTABLE LAYER OF AIR. 289

An attempt was made to get the patterns with different depths of channel. At a
thickness 1 mm. greater than the successful 8 mm., #.¢., at 9 mm. transverse rolls could
be obtained on occasions, but these were extremely irregular as fig. 10, Plate 2, taken
