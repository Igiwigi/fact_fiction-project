ACTIONS OF THE NEUROHYPOPHYSIS 401

It should be emphasized that the anti-diuretic effects of stimulation of the neurohypo-
physis were similar to those following intravenous injection of appropriate doses of posterior
lobe extracts (see figure 4). The following extracts were used: ‘pituitrin’ and ‘pitressin’
(Parke, Davis and Co.), pituitary (posterior lobe) extract (Boots Pure Drug Co.), and
extract of posterior lobe of the pituitary of rabbits. The spread of the stimulus

Two salient facts emerge from these results. The method of stimulation used makes it
possible to apply a precise and highly localized stimulus to the neurohypophysis, and the
nerve fibres supplying this organ are relatively insensitive to electrical stimulation. In group A were rabbits in which the stimulating tip of the electrode was situated at
varying distances from the neurohypophysis and in which the anti-diuretic responses
obtained on stimulation were few in number.
