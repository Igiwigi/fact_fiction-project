and the generating line of the other kind counting as 4[q—1] lines through three
points, 80 that

ImP+m—2+M=ip—1P+H[0—17.
The complete scroll $(1z) is made up of the hyperboloid considered as generated by the
generating lines of the one kind taken Z{[ p}* times, and the hyperboloid considered as
generated by the generating lines of the other kind taken Z[q]* times (80 that there is
in this case the speciality that the surfaces S'(m?), S"(77?) are in fact the same surface).
And hence we have
S(w)=(2(3[pP+3[197)=)8[PP +3007

21. I notice also the case of a system of 1m lines. Taking here a point on one of the
lines, the (þ—m+2=)[m]—m+2 lines through three points which can be drawn
through this point are the 4[m—1] lines which can be drawn meeting a pair of the other
(m—1) lines, and besides this the line itself counting as one line through three points
(4m—IlT+1l=[mP—m+2); the line itself, thus counting as a single line through three
points, is not to be reckoned as a line through four or more points drawn through the
point in question, that is, the system is not to be regarded as a curve through every
point of which there passes a line through four points: each of the lines is nevertheless
to be counted as a single line through four points, and (since there are besides two lines
