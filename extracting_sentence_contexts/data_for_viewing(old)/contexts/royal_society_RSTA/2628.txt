is an integer.

The total interaction energy W of one particle with all other molecules of the cluster is
given by

L 4nan ay"
w=| w(r)n4ar-dr = Wa a3 f - (7) , (3.1)

where d is the diameter of the particles and L is the size of the system. Note that the clustering
coefficient C=1 is this case because each particle interacts with every other particle. If d/LÂ«1
and m > 3, large distance contributions to the interaction will disappear [53]. This makes possible
the existence of intensive thermodynamic properties of condensed phases, which are independent
of the size of the system L. Such systems are called weakly coupled, due to the fact that most of
the energy of a particle comes from interactions between nearby neighbours.

However, for d/L <1, m <3, the contributions from more distant particles will dominate over
those of nearby ones [53]. In such cases (which are called strongly coupled systems), the size of
the system matters, as occurs for gravitational forces where n = 1 and where distant planets, stars
and galaxies are still strongly interacting with one another. Note that the boundary value m=3
arises from the 3D nature of the space. This marginal class of systems whose interaction decays
with an exponent equal to their dimensionality D (in other words, D = n1) will be discussed below
in the context of microfluidic droplet clusters.

The size of clusters is often of the same order of the diameters of the particles, namely
d/L=1, and it follows from equation (3.1) that the size of the system must be taken into
