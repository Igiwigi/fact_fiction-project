The bast in Agathis and Araucaria, according to SrraspurGER (1891, IIT), has no
albuminous cells associated with the rays. These he considers as the counterparts in
the bast of the ray tracheids in the wood, and finds that in exceptional cases only are
they not continuous with ray tracheids. Some of these cases have been explained by
the fact that the ray tracheids which were ancestrally present have been lost.f The
absence of the marginal medullary ray cells from the bast of the Araucarinew (and
Taxiner), STRASBURGER (1891, III, pp. 92-93) considers evidence of their primitive
structure. It is certainly almost in the nature of a demonstration that these forms
have had no connection with the Abietinez after the latter had developed ray
tracheids and albuminous marginal medullary ray cells.
