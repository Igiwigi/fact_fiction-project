into exactly & (multipartite) parts.

Art. 3. It is the same problem also to enumerate the separations of a given
(unipartite) partition. Thus in relation to the partition (321) of the number 6, there
is a one-to-one correspondence between the separations which involve two separates
and the partitions of the multipartite number 111, which involve exactly two parts.

The separations are in fact

(82) (1), (31) (2), (21) (8).

In general there is a one-to-one correspondence between the separations of the
partition
(a"'q,™ --- 9”),

which involve & separates, and the partitions of the multipartite number

which involve exactly & parts.
