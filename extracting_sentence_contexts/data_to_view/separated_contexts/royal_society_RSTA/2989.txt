(a) Theorem 1.1 for anti-de Sitter space

Clearly theorem 1.1 is stated in very general terms, however, one might worry that there are
implicit assumptions about the global (asymptotic) geometry within which the black hole of
interest sits. In fact, all that is really required is that the radiation can be remotely separated from
the black holeâ€™s interior and its surrounding neighbourhood (on distances large compared to the
UV cutoff, presumably the Planck scale). This is all we need to ensure that maximal entanglement
between R and B and/or N may be identified as contributing to the thermodynamic entropy of
these systems (as discussed in the main text). What about if there is a boundary to the space-time, such as in AdS space?
