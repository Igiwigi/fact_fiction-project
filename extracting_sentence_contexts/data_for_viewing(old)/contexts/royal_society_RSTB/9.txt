have often been described, and it is regarded by all the authorities as a well-marked
species. It has, however, so far as I know, not been specially investigated in detail,
and, in addition to the other facts contained in the following memoir, it is of interest
to have observed the germination of the conidia for the first time; the infection
experiments are also new, and consequently important, and they establish beyond
doubt the relations of the conidia to the Hntyloma.*

I now proceed to the description of my own observations, the completion of which
has been rendered possible by an outbreak of the disease which the fungus induces on
a large patch of densely crowded plants of Ranunculus Ficaria during the spring and
early summer of this year; this patch of diseased plants was so favourably situated,
and the fungus spread so rapidly and in such enormous numbers on it, that I was
enabled to observe and record some facts of considerable interest respecting the origin
and spread of the epidemic due to the action of the parasite. Moreover, material was
to hand in abundance and in excellent condition, and the circumstances were so
fortunate that it was possible to note day by day the symptoms of the disease, and
the progress, climax, and decline of the epidemic. I mention this expressly because
it is not sufficiently recognised how necessary is the study of the diseases of plants in
the field—clinically, as it were—as well as in the laboratory.

The patch of Ranunculus referred to above extended some distance along the
course of a conveniently situated damp ditch : during February and March thousands
of young fresh green leaves sprang up, and in April the ground was densely carpeted
with them ; the leaves were so closely packed that the ditch appeared full of them.
The ditch itself runs nearly due north to south, and is only damp as a rule; it
