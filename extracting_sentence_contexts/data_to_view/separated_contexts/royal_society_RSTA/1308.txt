For m=5 (figure 3d,h), the picture is clear. The
energy distance has a better approximation in all considered characteristics. Another fact that
can be observed for m =5 is that in the last step from t = 4 to t=5, the energy distance captures
better the path dependency than the Wasserstein distance. In a binary tree, the ratio of branches
which go upwards and downwards is equally distributed. As 11 =5 is odd this can never be
perfectly captured in ensemble reduction.
