APPARENTLY CORRELATED TO THE CONDITIONS OF LIFE. 315

In the eastern lake (No. 2) were great numbers of living Cockles. In texture
these shells resemble those of Ramleh Lake No. 1, though the tendency to ribbing
on the inside was not so much marked, being generally slightly present behind the
10th to 12th rib. The colour of the outside of the shells is yellowish-white almost all
over, but on the inside the region of the posterior 3 to 6 ribs is chocolate colour, but the
rest of the inside of the shells has the same bright white colour as in Ramleh Lake
No. 1, The proportion of length to breadth is very great in these shells. In 30
shells varying in length between 29 mm. and 16°5 mm. the average ratio of length
to breadth is 1 : 0°657, and in 30 shells varying in length between 21 mm. and 17 mm.
this average ratio is 1: 0°665. It is a remarkable fact that in the case of these shells
the increased proportional length is almost as much marked among the small shells as
it is amongst the large ones, and, as may be seen in Table VI. (a), this feature is
present fairly uniformly in nearly all the individuals.

Another character of these fresh-water shells is the frequent occurrence of specimens
with the free ventral margins of the shell bent inwards, as shown in Plate 26, fig. 13.

RecapiruLation (Mareotis and Ramleh Lakes).

The shells found in the Mareotis and Ramleh district were of four kinds: (1)
ancient shells, like the ancient shells of Abu Kir; (2) shells lately extinct (?) in
Mareotis itself. Though the conditions under which these animals lived cannot be
