ratings. The partial R’ values for the cross-linguistic data
shown in table 2 suggest a similarly humbling picture, with
6 out of 10 regression models describing less than 10% of
the variance.

The results presented here generalize the idea of emotional
grounding to a larger set of languages, but they also suggest
strong limitations. The following sums up all data-driven
results that speak against the emotional grounding of abstract

concepts:
