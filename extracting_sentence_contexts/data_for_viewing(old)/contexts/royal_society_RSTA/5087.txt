three overlapping, very distinct, slip bands. In fact, similar to the findings for Waspaloy discussed
earlier, the bands are very narrow and there is strong evidence for particle shearing in the
paired dislocations.

Precipitate shearing and slip band formation have further implications on the deformation
behaviour. It was shown, not unexpectedly, that in Nimonic 80A [34], heat-treated to contain
shearable precipitates, the slip bands acted as effective barriers and there was reasonable
correlation with a Hall-Petch kind of relationship, as shown in figure 10. The change in the
slope of the curve for the Nimonic 80A was associated with the onset of multiple slip bands.
The deformation substructure via optical microscopy and SEM is shown in figure 11. Also, the
form of the stress versus cycle number was exactly as seen in Waspaloy [26] for all strain levels
and precipitate sizes, indicative of precipitate shearing.
