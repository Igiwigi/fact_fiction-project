throughout. Thus there is nothing in the observed sunspot variation to account for
the rapidity of the variation in magnetic “ character.”

Taking the individual years, the largest sunspot area occurred in 1906 in column
n—7, in 1907 in column n+3, in 1908 in column +10, in 1909 in column n—2, and
only in 1910—a year of small sunspot area—did it oceur in column 7. Thus the
occurrence in column 7 of the highest percentage met with in Table IX. is a fact of
somewhat doubtful significance. A considerably longer series of years would be
required to give a result whose representative character could be relied on.

$18. In S.M., in the comparison made between sunspot area and magnetic
“character,” the representative days n were the days of largest spot area, On the
average of the 11 years 1890 to 1900, magnetic “character” was below its mean
from days n—7 to n inclusive, and above its mean from days n+1 to n+11. The

highest “character” figures appeared in columns n+4 to n+6, that in column n+4
being slightly the highest. In this case the sunspot area (primary) pulse was much
