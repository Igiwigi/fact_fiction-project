divided into electric and magnetic portions. This is with restriction to symmetrical
p and c, and with persistence of their forms as a particle moves, but is otherwise
unrestricted.

Neither stress is of the symmetrical or irrotational type in case of eolotropy, and
there appears to be no getting an irrotational stress save by arbitrary assumptions
which destroy the validity of the stress as a correct deduction from the electro-
magnetic equations. But, in case of isotropy, with consequent directional identity
of E and D, and of H and B, we see, by taking N in turns parallel to, or
perpendicular to E in the electric case, and to H in the magnetic case, that the
dlectric stress consists of a tension U parallel to E combined with an equal lateral
Bessure, whilst the magnetic stress consists of a tension T parallel to H combined
with an equal lateral pressure. There are, in fact, MAxWELt’s stresses in an isotropic
edium homogeneous as regards », and c. The difference from MAXWELL arises when
Ik and ¢ are variable (including abrupt changes from one value to another of p and c),
thd when there is intrinsic magnetisation, MAxWELt’s stresses and forces being then
&fferent,
