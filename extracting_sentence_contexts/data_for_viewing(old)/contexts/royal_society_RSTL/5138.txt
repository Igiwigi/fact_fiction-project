ENotwithstanding the roughness of the latter, the bands H and fixed lines far beyond
Sare seen with the utmost facility.

Z 94. These phenomena are much better observed by covering the slit with a deep
Sblue glass, which absorbs all the bright part of the spectrum, while it freely trans-
Smits the violet and invisible rays, which are mainly efficient in this class of pheno-
—mena. In this way fixed lines may be seen on common white paper far beyond H.
EThese lines may be seen without the use of the blue glass, by allowing the bright
=colours to pass by the edge of the paper, and receiving on it only the extreme violet
Sand invisiþble rays.

95. Paper coloured by turmeric having exhibited 80 well the sensibility of that
substance, I was induced to try various other washed papers, in fact, papers washed
with most of the fluids with which I had made experiments. I found almost always
that sensitive solutions gave rise to sensitive papers, exhibiting a change of refrangi-
bility of the same character as that shown by the solution. Besides the turmeric
paper, the two most remarkable were paper washed with a pretty strong solution of
sulphate of quinine, and paper washed with the extract from the seeds of the Datura
sframonium. T should here observe, that it was not till long after the time when these
experiments were made that I was acquainted with the high sensibility of a decoc-
tion. of the bark of the horse-chestnut. The former of the papers just mentioned ex-
