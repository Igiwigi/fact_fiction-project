that must have been the oyum in that organ ; Vox Bax in 1827 found and recognised
it there.

This important discovery of Bats formed an epoch in the history of development ;
but it was a © first step,” and the object one of extreme minuteness. It was there-
fore not surprising if the excellent discoverer did not see or justly estimate all that
appertained thereto ; and he said himself © there remains yet many a thing that will
become a prize” for others.

Von Baz for instance did not see the germinal vesicle contained within the mam-
miferous oyum ; he saw no more than a transparent space. This, however, was an
oversight of the first importance, because that which gives peculiar interest to the
germinal vesicle is the fact, now generally acknowledged, that it is the most essential
portion of the ovum ; and besides, as in the following pages I sball have to show, this
structure and its contents are the earliest that appear in the order of formation.
Overlooking the germinal vesicle in the Mammalia, Vox Bazr supposed the ovum
itself to represent, in that class of animals, the germinal vesicle of Birds. Other
analogies, and they are not few, which he based on this were consequently erroneous.

T have thought it proper to make these introductory remarks, because of the neces-

+ Professor Baz called the vesicle he discovered in the ovary, not the ovum but the © ovulum.” If, how-
ever, it can be made to appear extremely probable that the chorion or external membrane of the oyum of the
uterus is a primitive part of the ovarian vesicle of Baz, it is perhaps better to call the latter an ovum, as will
be done in this memoir,
