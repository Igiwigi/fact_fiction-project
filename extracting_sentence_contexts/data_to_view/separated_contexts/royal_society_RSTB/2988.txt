Mriiats says: “I have received wild Cats barely full
grown at such times as would lead me to suppose that they were born rather later than May, but hardly
so late as September ; the latest of these which I noted on receipt was probably barely six months old on
February 15. It was therefore probably born about the latter part of August, but may not have been born
until September. In captivity I have never observed a female wild Cat come in season during the summer

Many years, when owing to the death of the young or the fact that the pair had not bred
together in the spring, I have kept male and female together all summer, but they have shown no
inclination to breed.” {

or about the same time (MILLAIS, 1904).
