plexity. From the base of the tree two alternative items of a
complexity level of 1 can be produced, A and B. Each of
these items can then be improved in two different ways.
Item A, for example, can give rise to AA or AB, which are
items with a complexity level of 2. Alternatively, item B can
give rise to BA or BB. The number of cultural items that
can be produced at any given level of complexity C equals
2Â° as each new item opens two alternative pathways.

Highly complex items are composed of simpler items
along the same trajectory. An increase in cultural complexity
is represented as a climb up the tree, and cultural loss as a
walk down it. This captures the fact that the accumulation
of cultural traits leads to new branching possibilities, that is
new opportunities for cultural diversity.

Figure 1. The cultural landscape is modelled as a branching tree. Each node represents a cultural item that can give rise to two new cultural items. More complex
items are composed of an increasing number of sub-items. Progress along different trajectories leads to cultural divergence. The number of alternative items
increases with cultural complexity according to 2 The coloured lines are examples of progression within the landscape. The individual in red produced A
then AB then ABA. The diversity level of her cultural repertoire is 3 (she knows A, AB and ABA) and its complexity level is 3 (that is the complexity level of
