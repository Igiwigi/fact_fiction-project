The relative length and degree of curvature of the jugal differ considerably in
different species of Ichthyosaurus; in some, as for instance J. intermedius, the bone
is not so much curved as angulated. ;

In making a comparison with the jugal of Sphenodon it may first be pointed out
that Osawa has given an imperfect account of this bone owing to his having oyer-
looked the prolongation of its horizontal limb beneath the orbit. This curious
oversight is doubtless due to the fact that this prolongation cannot be seen on the _
face, where it is completely concealed by the maxilla, but is plainly visible on the
floor of the orbit, and is well defined by sutures. Howes and Swinnyerton have

figured it correctly.
