the first term whereof, substituting for (a, b, c, f, g., h, 1, m, n, p) their values, is in fact

loss of generality in putting all but two of the quantities (2,4, », e, s, 7) equal to zero;
in fact this leaves in the formulee a single arbitrary quantity, which is the right number,
since the ratios B : C : D : E have to satisfy only the two conditions C=0, D=0. ApDp1T10N, Nov. 10, 1862. I take the opportunity of remarking, with reference to my memoir *
