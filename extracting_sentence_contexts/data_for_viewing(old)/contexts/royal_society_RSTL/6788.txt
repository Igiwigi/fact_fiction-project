< labours, in the early part of the eighteenth century, the merit of having been guided by
E a proper spirit of experimental inquiry. Nor did he fail in applying to good account,
and eyen in extending, the then existing knowledge of the material things around him
= Which were apparently inyolyed in the mysterious processes of vegetable growth.
Y With our present knowledge, however, of the general composition of plants, and of
S the sources of their constituents, it is easy to see how essential was a proper under-
2 Standing of the chemistry of the air, and of water, to any true conceptions of the mate-
Z rial changes involved in the vegetative process. Tt can, indeed, hardly excite surprise,
5 that what may be called the germs of our present knowledge of the chemistry of plant-
2 growth came forth almost simultaneously with the now adopted views of the compo-
'S Sition of those univyersal, though not exclusive, media of vegetation—air, and water.
S Accordingly, it is between the dates of 1770 and 1800 that we find BLACK, SCHEELE,
& PresTLEY, Lavoisler, CAVENDISH, and Warr establishing for us the facts that common
+ air consists chiefly of nitrogen and oxygen, with a little carbonic acid, that carbonic
ZE acid itself is composed of carbon and oxygen; and that water is composed of hydrogen
5 and oxygen; and it is within the same period that PresTLEY and Txcatxnnousz, SENNE-
S BIER and Woopnoruss, laboured to show the mutual relations of these bodies and vege-
© table growth.
S But the observers last mentioned seem to have had more prominently in view the
Z question of the influence of plants upon the media with which they were surrounded,
A than that of the influence of these media in contributing materially to the increased
substance of plants themselves. Following closely on their footsteps, both in point of
time and in general plan of research, came Ds SavssURE. His labours were conducted
towards the end of the last century and in the beginning of the present one ; and their
results, and the arguments he founded upon them, published by him in 1804, may be
