634 DR. RISIEN RUSSELL ON DEGENERATIONS CONSEQUENT

criticism of my results, as this method of tracing the degenerated nerve fibres }
been exclusively employed in the present investigation.
The discrepancies which exist between the results as obtained by Marcut in trae
the degenerations consequent on ablation of parts of the cerebellum, and the
obtained by Ferrier and Turner after similar lesions of this organ, are sufficie
reasons why I should record my experience in this connection,
I determined to employ Marcut’s own method of tracing the degenerations con
quent on ablation of parts or the whole of the cerebellum, and had condueted |
large number of such investigations, before I became aware that Frerrrer and Tury 7
had undertaken the same task, a fact which was made known to me just before the;
observers brought their results before the Royal Society.
Ferrier and TurNER have relied mainly on the We1cER?T or WEIGERT-Pat meth
of staining the tissues in their attempts to trace the degenerations which res
from lesions of the cerebellum ; but no contradiction of Marcut’s results based o1
this method of tracing the degenerations can be accepted as conclusive, for there cai
be no question that the WEIcERT-PaL method cannot compare in delicacy with
Marcut method for tracing small tracts, or the terminal ramifications of large one
It is not surprising therefore that my results do not entirely accord with those
Ferrier and Turner, though they do so in respect to certain points in which the
observers believe Marcut’s results to be erroneous.
I hope to be able to show further, that I have obtained certain results which
not appear to have engaged the attention of either of the observers whose results
