Fox & Southwell carried out further computations on a finer mesh, but even here the
error at the central point was as much as 13 units. At least one finer mesh, involving no less
than 136 points, would certainly be required if the difference-corrections for differential
equations and particularly for boundary condition are to be ignored. The dangers of ill-
conditioning already mentioned are correspondingly magnified.

8. Curved boundaries

The theory of the treatment of curved boundaries in the biharmonic equation is not more
difficult than in the corresponding harmonic case; in one important particular, in fact, the
problem is easier. This arises from the form of the boundary conditions, which usually
specify both the function and its normal derivative. This is equivalent to specifying the
function and its boundary derivative in all directions, in particular in the direction of

the mesh lines.* The difficulties mentioned in ยง 4 are therefore not likely to occur with the
biharmonic equation. The remaining problems are purely practical ones, arising from the
relatively complicated nature of the finite-difference form of the biharmonic equation.
