They vary in
appearance much in the same manner as does the embryonic uranium halo, That is
to say, some show a greater degree of darkening than others. â€˜They may present the
appearance of a delicate smoke-coloured ring, or be more or less darkened within,
the original ring appearing as a still darker border. They are often wonderfully
sharp in outline. At an early stage they may show the faint development of the
ring due to RaC, that is, of the fourth ring of the uranium halo, This fact at once
attaches them to the uranium series of elements.
