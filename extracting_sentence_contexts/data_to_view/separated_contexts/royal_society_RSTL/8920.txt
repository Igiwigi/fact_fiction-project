To this it may be replied that
we are here considering results; that the expression (7—«) means the occurrence of a
phenomenon of which the result is the substitution of @ for z. But it does not inform
us of any particular way in which this result is attained. And, in fact, this result may
with equal justice be considered as the aggregate of the two transferences (&—1)—(a—1)
as a 8ingle substitution. Such an expression, therefore, as (y—&a)(y—b) is always to be
regarded as an abbreviated form of expression for the aggregate

(z—1(y—1)—(z—1(b—1)—(«—1(y—U+(«- (5 =1). Similarly, developing the expression (zy—ab), we have
a2y—ab=(a—1)+(y—1)+(z—1X(y—1)—(a—1)—(b—1)=(a2—16—1),
80 that the event symbolized (for example) as (xy—ab)(2—1) is to be regarded as an
abbreviated expression for the aggregate of events,
(#=1z—1)+(y—1)(2—1)+(#—1(—1\2—1)—(a—1(2—1)(6—12—1)
—(a—1)b—1)z—1).
