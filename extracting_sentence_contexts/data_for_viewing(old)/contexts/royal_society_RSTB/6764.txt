ectoderm has almost recovered from the degenerative changes seen at the previous
stage, except over the hinder part of the sternum where the plates have not yet united;
here the epithelium is still somewhat folded and degenerate.

424 HONOR B. FELL ON THE ORIGIN AND

By the time stage 7 is reached, when the plates have fused except at the extreme
hind-end and a mesenchymatous keel extends along the line of union, degeneration
in the mid-ventral mesoderm has greatly diminished beneath the forepart of the keel.
Farther back, however, it remains pronounced, probably owing to the fact that the
pectoral muscles are fairly widely separated in this region and are still connected by
a thick band of flattened cells.

A few hours later (stage 8) (fig. 15, Plate 35), when union of the plates is complete,
the pectoral muscles have come to occupy their final position in relation to the keel,
and the band of degeneration has disappeared from the mesenchyme throughout the
length of the sternal region. The ventral body wall now consists of normal skin, with
rather thin epidermis and thick, vascular dermis, beneath which are the pectoral
muscles attached to either side of the keel by fibrous connective tissue.
