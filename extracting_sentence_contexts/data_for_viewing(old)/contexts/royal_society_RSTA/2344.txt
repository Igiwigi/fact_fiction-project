circular shape made it easier to evacuate the gases, but also offered less resistance to the wind,
one of the main actions for which these structures were originally designed to resist. On the other
hand, the circular shape implied a lower consumption of material, although in this case the bricks
had a rounded shape to adapt themselves to the chimneyâ€™s geometry. The crown is the upper part
of the stack and finishes the chimney; its function is purely ornamental and it usually contains
bricks arranged differently from the stack (figure 1).

The total height of the industrial chimneys in Portugal usually varies between 20 and 30m.
Industrial chimneys over 30m, such as those shown in figure 1, are usually associated with
important industrial companies. The height of the industrial chimneys also depends on the
surroundings, since it should guarantee that nearby populations would not be affected by the
smoke. The binder used in the masonry was usually lime mortar, although cementitious mortars
are also found in more recent industrial chimneys. In fact, after the invention of Portland cement,
Portuguese twentieth-century constructions had the lime mortar replaced by cement mortar.

According to archive documents, such as the one shown in figure 1c, the foundations of these
industrial chimneys were made of a bottom layer of concrete, which received a massive block
