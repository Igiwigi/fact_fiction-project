rest of the apparatus by a bent tube of considerable length, as for example in the
apparatus shown in fig. 2, shows that this is not the source of the nuclei.

The question whether the nuclei which exist in small numbers in moist air are

qgharged or not must, I think, be left an open one for the present. It is manifestly a
Snatter of considerable meteorological interest.
4 The view which was taken in previous papers concerning the dense fogs which are
“Sbtained with expansions exceeding the second limit v./v, = 1°38, was that the degree
woe supersaturation is then great enough to cause condensation to take place indepen-
Alently of all nuclei other than the molecules of gas or vapour themselves. According
‘Ho this view no effect is to be expected on applying an electric field when expansions
So great as this are used. In fact, the same apparatus being used as before, no
Blifference could be detected in the appearance of these fogs, whether they were pro-
Bluced in the absence of any electric field, or with a difference of potential of
P25 volts, between the tin and water surfaces, these being 1 centim. apart.

5 The experiments described in this paper furnish strong evidence that the passage
aot electricity through gases is effected by carriers of the same nature, whether the
ronducetion is the result of exposure of the gas to Réntgen rays or Uranium rays, or
the action of ultra-violet light on a negatively electrified zine plate, or consists in the
Eescape of electricity from a pointed platinum wire. It is not only in their efficiency
