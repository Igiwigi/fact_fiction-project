© On the Expansion by Heat of Water and Mercury” *, I described a
method of determining the expansion of bodies by weighing them in water at different
temperatures. This method was chosen on account of its yielding accurate results with
comparatively small quantities, for to purify large quantities of metal would entail
immense labour and expense; 80 much 80, in fact, that to purify sufficient quantities to
make bars for the determination of the linear expansion would be practically impossible. On determining the expansion of the metals by this method, I found that they did
not expand regularly between 0” and 100”, The difference, however, between the rates
of expansion between 0? and 50? and 50? and 100? was found to be s0 great that part of
it might be possibly attributed to errors in the determination of the coefficients of expan-
sion of water, as the coefficients of expansion of the metals are comparatively small
when compared with those of water. Now, although the coefficient of expansion of mer-
cury when determined by this method agrees with REGxXAavu1T's value, yet on account of
this value being large, small errors in the water coefficients will not materially influence
it ; for the yolume of water at

4*=1-0000, at 100*=1-04316,
that of mercury at
0*=1-0000, at 100*=1-01815,
and that of copper, for instance, at
0*=1-00000, at 100*=1004998,
Showing that the expansion of copper is yery small compared with that of water or
mercury.
