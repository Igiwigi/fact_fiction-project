therefore, we can update our terminology, and expand our definitions, by turning to Iris
Murdoch, who distinguished not between imagination and fancy but between imagination
and fantasy.”

3. Murdoch on imagination and fantasy

Like Coleridge, Murdoch (1919-1999) also spanned the worlds of philosophy and literature, as
the author of more than 25 novels (starting with Under the Net, published in 1954) and several
works of philosophy, Metaphysics as a Guide to Morals (1992) being her most extended work.
Educated at the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge, she was a fellow in philosophy at St
Anne’s College, Oxford, from 1948 until 1963. Also like Coleridge, and Kant before him, Murdoch
located imagination in every act of perception. ‘The world which we confront is not just a world of
“facts”’, she wrote, ‘but a world upon which our imagination has, at any given moment, already
worked’ [29]. In saying this, she was not reducing our understanding of the world to mere fiction
or projection. Her point is that we only understand the world in as much as it has entered into
our apprehension: in as much as it has been taken up into our imagination, or overarching image
of reality. In this way, and again like Coleridge, Murdoch did not see the exercise of imagination
as an overlay that obscures the world, but as a matter of entering into reality, so that it may enter
into us, as represented by internal images.

Fundamental to Murdoch’s vision here is her contention that to know and act imaginatively
is to be willing to turn towards the world, so as to receive from it. She saw this as far more

from a Pragmatic Point of View as ‘the power of imagination’ to produce images in an ‘involuntary’ fashion [20]. His contrast
