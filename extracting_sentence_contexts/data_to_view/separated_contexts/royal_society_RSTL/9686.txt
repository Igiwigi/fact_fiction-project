Then followed,
instead of drought and heat, drought and unusual cold, both day and night, especially
the latter, and the already backward herbage was very materially damaged, yielding
not only checked and stunted, but really damaged crops. In the discussion of the characteristic effects of the different manures, it has been
pointed ont, in general terms, that both the botanical and the chemical composition
of the mixed herbage varied very greatly according to the deseription of manure
» applied ; and the foregoing typical illustrations of the effects of the varying climatic
conditions of different seasons clearly indicate how different, both botanically and
chemically, will be the character of the produce dependent on the character of the
8easons. In fact, a given quantity of gross produce of the mixed herbage may be one
thing in one season, and quite another in another season, both as to the proportion of
the different species composing it, and their condition of development and maturity. In this place, however, we have to deal with the question of the quantity rather than
= of the quality of the produce, and from this point of view the few illustrations of the
influence of season which have been given will suffice. But, in the next section of our
report—* Part IT,—The Botanical Results ”—the characters of the four seasons in
which the botanical analyses of the produce were undertaken will be considered ; and
then, not only will the effects of variation of climatal conditions on the quantity of
produce yielded be further elucidated, but an endeavour will be made to trace a
connexion between the distinctive habits of growth of plants of different orders,
genera, or species, and the way in which, accordingly, their predominance, and the
amount, and the character, of their development, are influenced by the characters of
the seasons.
