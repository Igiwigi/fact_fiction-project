Thus, a lot of intra-
type reasoning in science might be reinterpreted as inter-type reasoning in a given context (we
would expect this to be particularly true in the life sciences, and also in molecular and materials
science). Moreover, there exist examples of scientists using Wilsonian type universality arguments
to justify inter-type reasoning of this form in a range of condensed matter contexts [106-109]. Thus inter-type inductive reasoning is in fact far more credible, and mundane, than it might at
first seem. Let us then instead interpret the scepticism to be regarding the rule of inference from accessible
to inaccessible phenomena. That the ‘inaccessibility’ of the target system is at the heart of
Crowther et al.’s worry is indicated numerous times in the paper.
