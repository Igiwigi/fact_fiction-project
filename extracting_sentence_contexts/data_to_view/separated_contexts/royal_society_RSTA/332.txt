The network is acyclic, which is seen in the fact that after
a suitable reordering of the variables (which has been done here), all the arrows go down.

4. Testing of independent components

After estimating ICA, it would be very useful to assess the reliability or statistical significance of
the components. In fact, in the literature, independent components estimated from various kinds
of scientific data are often reported without any kind of validation, which seems to be against the
basic principles of scientific publication. The classical validation of estimation results is statistical significance (also called reliability),
which assesses if it is likely that the results could be obtained by chance. In the context of ICA,
we would like to be able to say if a component could be obtained, for example, by inputting just
pure noise to an ICA algorithm.
