VI. Of the Analysis of the Chemical Rays of the Spectrum by Absorbent Media.

100. As the effectual study of mixed colours, as nature presents them to us, would
be impracticable by the mere use of absorbent media, unaided by prismatic analysis,

would be equally unavailing, were such media alone resorted to for the purpose of
effecting a separation of the luminous elements prior to their action. A combination
of their analysis with that effected by the prism will lead, however, to results of no
small interest. The facts I am about to recite, 80 far from exhausting or even s8y-
stematically arranging and attacking the subject, are hardly more than sufficient to
show what a singularly wide field of inquiry is here laid open to us.

101. To study this subject in its most simple form, it would be necessary to ope-
rate on 8ome preparation which shall be equally and indifferently sensitive to every
ray of the spectrum. Such a preparation, with exception of the rays beyond the ex-
treme red, exists in the bromuretted paper of Art. 77. But when the paper used to
receive the spectrum, after undergoing absorptive analysis, has its own peculiar law
of sensitiveness, it is evident that the resulting impression left on snch paper will be
a mixed effect depending on two distinct functions, the one expressing the degree of
transmissibility or diacratic index of the medium for that ray, the other that of sensi-
bility in the paper to the action of such ray.
