contrast, the SPBS_ON forecasts are very close to the control experiment stochphysOFF, in terms
of both spread and error. This means that it is primarily the perturbed tendency scheme that
generates a smaller RMSE and a larger spread of the ensemble compared with the control
forecasts. The backscatter scheme by itself has only a very small impact.

The improvements owing to the stochastic parametrizations in System 4 in reducing both
the RMSE and under-dispersiveness of ENSO forecasts may appear small. However, they are
approximately of the same order as the effects of changing the physical parametrization packages
and model configurations as occurs from one ECMWF seasonal forecast model version to the
next [17].


The fact that the stochastic physical parametrizations in System 4 improve the forecast quality
of the tropical Pacific SSTs is in good agreement with the conclusions of Weisheimer ef al.
[13], who compared the impact of stochastic parametrizations in seasonal forecasts of tropical
Pacific SSTs with the multi-model and perturbed physical parameter approaches to account for
model uncertainty.

6. Quasi-stationary circulation regimes over the Pacific-North America region

The notion of how stochastic perturbations have the potential to impact on the long-term
statistics of multi-modal systems has been discussed in the Introduction. While §§3 and 4 focused
on analysing the impact of the operational stochastic physical parametrizations in ECMWF’s
seasonal forecasting system on the mean state and the statistics of the MJO, in this section, we
shall discuss how the stochastic perturbations in System 4 affect the statistics of quasi-stationary
