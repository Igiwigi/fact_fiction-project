The fraction of hemizygous genomic sequence in the
mussel is nearly sixfold that of S. broughtonii, the species
with the highest hemizygosity among those included in this
study (ie. 36.78% versus 6.69%). Moreover, approximately
35% mussel protein-coding genes were encoded by hemizy-
gous genomic regions, as opposed to less than 2% found in
the eight molluscan species studied here (table 2). These
differences may be partially attributable to the fact that the
estimates provided here derive from only single individuals. Further sampling will be needed to find the regions that
are homozygous absent (nullizygous) from these specimens,
but present more generally in the wider population. The size
of the hemizygous regions not incorporated into these particu-
lar assemblies could be significant.
