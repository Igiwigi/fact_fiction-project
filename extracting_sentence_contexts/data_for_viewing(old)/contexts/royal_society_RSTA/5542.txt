considering that wavelet p-leaders moments of positive and negative orders q (in contrast with
the second-order moments only as in equation (2.1)) behave as power laws with respect to:

The collection of scaling exponents ¢(q) for positive and negative q can be associated with the
multifractal spectrum D(h) of the signal X, and thus describes fine details of its temporal dynamics.
A first limitation in the use of these scaling exponents ¢(q) lies in the fact that
they mix-up linear and nonlinear temporal dynamics. To disentangle nonlinear dynamics

from linear dynamics, it has been proposed to rewrite S$, (j,q) = (1/1) Ya ei, O17 as

Sen (i,q) = (1/n;) Yea exp(qlog PG, k)|) thus motivating the use of the cumulants of log-leaders
