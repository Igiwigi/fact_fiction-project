transformation might have no discontinuity of direction in the full linear range there
would be discontinuities in the analytical form of the equation to the curve at
the extremities of the inner range. This illustrates the fact that a curve-factor, which, for its total linear range
of curvilinearity, is not necessarily simple, may have branch-points not only at
the extremities of the linear range but also at points within the range. If the
general character of the types already chiefly considered is to be maintained in such
a multiple curve-factor, the net effect of proceeding along the real axis of w with a
suitable detour round each branch-point must be simply a change of sign when the
whole range has been traversed. ‘Thus the formula

@,, = w—k+ (w—a)? (w—e,)™ (w—e,)"... (w—b)4,. 2. . (188)

where a > ¢, > ¢, >...>¢,>k> ¢,4,>...> 0, gives a curve-factor provided all the
indices are positive, and

The function has no real zeros, and there can be no imaginary zeros in the relevant
region unless the angular range is different from 7. On writing down the expression
for the tangent of the vector angle x in any sub-range ce, to ¢,,, it can be verified
that, except in the case of s = 7, infinities of tan x, if they occur at all, must occur in
pairs which are not separated by a zero, Thus all the sub-ranges have zero angular
ranges, except one whose angular range is 7, and so the total angular range is 7.
