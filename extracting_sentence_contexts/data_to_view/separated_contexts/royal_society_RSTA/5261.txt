Also shown in figure 1 is the value of the steady-state dissipation rate h - fr, which is also the
upper bound for the dissipation rate in any flow, and the numerical estimate of & computed
by simulating the system (3.2) from random initial conditions and taking the time average of &
over a suitably long interval. The numerical estimates use the average of 20 simulations at each
Reynolds number. While the background-flow method introduced in [40] appears to be rather different from
the analysis here, in fact it is equivalent, up to the reduction to a finite-dimensional case, to
selecting in our approach V = p2. Because every positive-definite polynomial of a second degree
can be represented as an SOS, our result for a second-degree polynomial V produces the best
bound obtainable by the background-flow method applied to this finite-dimensional system. Comparing the results for the second-degree and higher-degree polynomials, one can judge the
potential improvement in the bound owing to the change in degree.
