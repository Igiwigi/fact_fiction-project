inquiries have been made under cireumstances of great adyantage, for the living plants
have never before been under the control of the experimenter. The ability to study the
changes occurring in the growing tissues cannot fail to throw light on the formation and
physiological functions of the chemical constituents whose production is the object of
the undertaking.

The organic principles which characterize these cinchona-barks are the alkaloids
Quinine, Cinchonidine, Cinchonine, and occasionally Quinidine, the peculiar bitter
principle Quinovin, the acids Quinic and Quinotannic, and in small amount another
not fully investigated.

Without attempting to describe the well-known alkaloids, it may be stated that all
the facts known point to a marked natural connexion between quinine and cinchonidine,
notwithstanding the difference of an atom of oxygen in their composition. Thus the
analysis of the individual plants will frequently give results which show the same amount
of alkaloids, but which differ by the respective quantities of these alkaloids, while all

other constituents remain unaffected. Chemically these alkaloids greatly resemble each
other, their solutions both rotate the plane of polarization to the left, and their salts
and behaviour with reagents are very similar. With the exception that cinchonidine
