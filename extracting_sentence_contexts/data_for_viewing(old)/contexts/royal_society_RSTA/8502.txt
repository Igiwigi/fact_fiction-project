§1. Examination for the law y (T + A)=C.

A glance at the graph (fig. 10), which gives the reciprocals of the principal susceptibilities
of cobalt ammonium sulphate as functions of the absolute temperature, will show
immediately that down to about 80° K. the graphs consist of three approximately parallel
straight lines, none of which pass through the zero. From this fact we may draw two
important conclusions, viz. :—

(1) That each of the principal susceptibilities follows the Wxiss law y, (I + A) = C (and
not the simpler Curie law x (T) = C) down to about nitrogen temperatures and

(2) the Curte constant C is approximately the same in the three cases, since C is given
by the slope of the curve. ;

The similar result of Fo®x* thus receives confirmation from the present work.

Tn columns 2, 3 and 4 of the first table on p. 39 are given the values of ’,,, (T + A,),
Xam (T-+ Ay) and y's, (I+ As) derived from the observations. The values of
