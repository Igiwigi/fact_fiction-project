are not properly a construction at all. Many Mycetophilid larvae are covered with
slimy silk they are constantly emitting. The matter emitted by Diadocidia appears
to be of a more silky and less slimy nature than usual, and I imagine that to this
fact and to the adhesion to the wood and possibly to some peculiarity in the integu-
ment of the larva the tubular form taken by its emitted matter is due.”

“ The larva frequently rests in the anterior part of the tube and protrudes its small
head, moving it from side to side and touching the wood but making no movement
that looks like the prehension of food. When alarmed it will dart rapidly along the
tube as already stated, but usually its movement is a deliberate glide made apparently
without any effort. The posterior part of the body is sometimes apparently exerted
from the tube and when again withdrawn it leaves a prolongation of the smear
behind it. It is in fact always covered with the slime or silk and it looks as if this
were extruded from the posterior part of the body. I believe, however, this is not
the case, but that it comes from the mouth and that the posterior part of the body is
constantly as it were drowned in this sludge. This point is of importance in con-
nexion with the absence of breathing organs in the abdominal region.”

“ Notwithstanding the larval breadth being almost that of the tube, the larva
experiences no difficulty in turning itself in the other direction by doubling up.
When the larva is full grown it advances to one extremity of the tube and forms
outside it a curious little mass of silken matter so irregularly formed that it is scarcely
entitled to be called a cocoon ; in this it turns to a pupa and if so fortunate as to
escape being eaten by some of its numerous predacious neighbours, emerges in a few
days. In the case of our specimens indoors this was in the latter part of October.”
