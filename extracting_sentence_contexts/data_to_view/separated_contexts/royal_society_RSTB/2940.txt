1, 2 and 9). Elements with black contents,
recalling the “secretory sacs” of Lyyinodendron, can sometimes be detected in the
cupular tissue, but their characters are not definite enough to help materially in
identification. The most interesting point about the ground-tissue of the cupule is
the fact that it was infested with fungi. Fungus-spores are almost always to be
detected ; in some specimens (e.g., U. C. L., R. 15) the tissues are completely filled
with them, and they occur in such masses that they might be taken for a part of the
normal structure, if it were not for comparison with other specimens in which the
sume bodies occur isolated. Fungal hyphe are also found, sometimes forming dense
strands following the course of the vascular bundles.
