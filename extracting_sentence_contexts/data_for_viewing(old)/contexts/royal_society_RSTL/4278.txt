In the functional relations of their respective parts. For whilst in the former there

But the limits of sveb individuality as this cannot be strictly defined, and they

And the question in regard to the functional independence of its multiple segments, is

self-sustaining, and to prevent the existence of any definite limit to the growth of the
whole; yet it is quite possible that in a form 80 much more elevated as Nummulite,
there may be, as maintained by MM. p'Arxcaiac and Hains (op. cit. p. 69), such a
degree of mutual dependence among the segments, and of unity in their aggregate
life, that the latter predominates sufficiently to limit the growth of the organism to a
