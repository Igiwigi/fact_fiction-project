Note, in particular, that most vocal
learning mammals are not typical terrestrial quadrupeds,
but rather aquatic (cetaceans), semi-aquatic (pinnipeds) or
terrestrial flying animals (bats). Therefore, our and any cross-
species analysis needs to consider these speciesâ€™ adaptation
to a highly three-dimensional lifestyle: this factor, rather than
VPL, could be the main driver of allometric deviations. Like-
wise, the fact that several vocal learners also echolocate
introduces an additional bias. Unfortunately, until more
species of terrestrial vocal learners are discovered, it will be
difficult to disentangle these factors. Second, selective press-
ures may also have favoured the emergence of vocal learning
abilities without necessarily affecting acoustic allometry
relationships.
