the equilibrium therefore, in exercise, is never approached at all closely when the
oxygen consumption is great and the arterial blood becomes dark in colour.

Instances could be cited in actual life, both in which the arterial blood does, and
in which it does not, darken on exercise. Normally, there is little or no change in
the colour of the arterial blood when the oxygen consumption increases, a fact which
looks as though fig. 31B was the one which most correctly represents the normal
condition, for in it the value of 1/P — p, could decrease to one-fifth of that shown in
the picture without any appreciable shift in the position of the line ; and even if its
length were reduced 1/16 of that shown, X’Y’ would only revert to the position of
90 per cent. saturation, and the saturation of the arterial blood would be above
95 per cent. instead of 96 per cent. On the other hand, in rabbits poisoned with
pulmonary irritant, in which the diffusion coefficient must be very low, for a great part
of the lung is out of action altogether and the rest much impaired, the properties of
the animal are such as would be suggested by fig. 31a. If the legs are thrown into
contraction the arterial blood at once darkens, and presumably because, as Q increases,
1/P — p must decrease, and this can only be obtained by the whole region of utilisa-
tion, including even its upper limit, being forced away from the position of approximate
