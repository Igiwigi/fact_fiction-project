b. For the whole of past life (past fertility) ; and as total of both values—

ce. Life fertility, that is, number of children during the whole duration of life,
and as a special kind of this latter, the full life fertility, showing the number of
children to be expected for the case that the parents lived together during the
whole procreative period.

But these values cannot be deduced from the Table of Natality, which shows only
the probability of birth for a year. One might perhaps think that the addition of
the natalities stated for each year of the procreative period, would furnish the
probability for this whole period. To prove the impracticability of such a proposition
it is sufficient to point out the physiological fact that female conception stops not
only during childbed, but even during the period of lactation. There exists between

* The anthor deals with this question in a more particular way in his ‘ Demologische Beitriige,’ aud
in his book on the fertility in Budapest, now in preparation. Though this question cannot be treated in
this place, I feel, notwithstanding, obliged to mention at least some important contributions to it. Such
are—Rupin-Westercaarp, ‘Statistik der Ehen’ (translated from the Danish), Jena, 1890; R. Borckn’s

quoted in this essay,
