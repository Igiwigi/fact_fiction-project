light. On removal of the light from the system a similar though not identical
curve is obtained, which is the reversal of the first. It should be added that it has
been established beyond doubt, in four different ways, that the peculiar form of the
curves was not due to the inertia of the moving galvanometer mirror, but repre-
sented the true nature of the phenomena.

When we look away from the line which gives in the above-mentioned kind of
curve zero deflection in the dark, we are struck by the fact that all these curves seem
to have one characteristic course, as if under the action of light two opposite E.M.F.’s
of two different values and with two different rates of increase were simultaneously
produced, each of them ultimately reaching a maximum value, and on removal of the
light the two E.M.F.’s disappear with different speeds. According as one or the
other is more rapidly produced, the total E.M.F. starts by moving in one or other
direction; as long as one E.M.F. preponderates over the other, the total E.M.F.
continues in the same direction; when the preponderating E.M.F. reaches, or almost
reaches, its maximum, while the opposite, owing to its being produced with a smaller
speed, is still increasing, the total E.M.F. begins again to decrease, the mirror begins
to move in the opposite direction, and the total E.M.F. goes on diminishing, until the
opposite E.M.F. reaches its maximum; then the total E.M.F., which is equal to the
difference of both constant E.M.F.’s, will remain constant in light, 2.e., will give a
