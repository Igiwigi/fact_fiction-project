down at the trigeminal gill slit. The skeleton of the gill septum lying between the

trigeminal and facial gill slits, which consisted of a single chain of four elements, the
pharyngo-, epi-, cerato- and hypo-branchial cartilages or bones, thus came to be
related to the mouth, and its musculature enabled it to be used as a jaw. In fact it
becomes the palato-quadrate and Meckelâ€™s cartilage. At this stage the facialis or
hyoid gill slit obviously remains of its original size and structure; it was identical in all
its important features with the glossopharyngeal gill slit. This is the primitive Gnatho-
stome condition.
