MOTOR CORTEX AND INTERNAL CAPSULE IN AN ORANG-OUTANG. 145

From an inspection of the foregoing table which, with the exception of the combina-
tion of facial and oro-lingual movements to be mentioned later, is an absolute record
of all the “ marches” noted to have occurred, the extreme paucity of such combina-
tions shows more clearly than words to what a remarkable extent the representation
of each individual segment is integrated in the cortex of the Orang. Too much stress
cannot be laid upon this point since it demonstrates incontestably the great advance
in evolution of function of the Orang’s cortex above that of the Macacque, for, in the
latter animal, single primary* movements were only rarely obtained, and even then
by only momentary application of the electrodes,

Tn complete harmony with this view we also see that at only two groups of squares
was there a combination of segmental movements in the upper limb (viz., 83, and 28,
29, 30), and these only involved the digits and wrist, whereas in the lower limb no
less than nine such combinations were observed, and those (owing to duplication) at
eleven squares. The limited extent of such combinations is also manifested by the fact that all the
segments of the lower limb were thrown into action at only two squares (63 and 64),
and at a large number of the remainder only two segments were involved. We have now to consider four points in this connection, these are :—

(1.) Combination of facial and oro-lingual movements.

(2.) Juxtaposition of synergic segments.

(3.) Character of movements in each march.

(4.) Relative position of squares from which marches were obtained.

* Te. a single movement not followed by any other movements, which latter we have termed
secondary, tertiary, &c., in the successive order of their appearance (‘ Phil. Trans.,’ B, 1887, 1888).
