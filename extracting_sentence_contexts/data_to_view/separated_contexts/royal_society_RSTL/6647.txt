In the experiments on the question of the assimilation of free Nitrogen,
however, but a very small proportion of the total organic matter is subjected to decom-
posing actions apart from those associated with growth, and this for a comparatively
short period of time, at the termination of which the organic form is retained, and
therefore but little carbon is lost. It would appear, then, that- we need not fear any
serious error in our experiments in regard to the latter question, arising from the
evolution of free Nitrogen in the decomposition of the nitrogenous organic matters

olved. On the other hand, the facts adduced afford a probable explanation of any
ll loss of Nitrogen which may occur when seeds have not grown, or when leaves, or
r dead matter, have suffered partial decomposition.

"The importance attached by MuLpeR, and others after him; to the action of nascent
Irogen, evolved in the decompoxsition of organic matter, upon gaseous Nitrogen, as a
e of ammonia, is snch as to require that we should refer to the subject here, in
he course of the discussion of the conditions possibly affecting the snpply of combined
Nitrogen to our experimental plants. The results given in the last sub-section (pp- 509â€”

er. They suggest, therefore, the possibility that snch an evolution may take place
ny decomposition of organic matter involved in our experiments on the assimilation
free Nitrogen by plants, and hence prove a source of ammonia to them.
= That nascent hydrogen may, under certain cireumstances, combine with gaseous
itrogen, has long been admitted.
