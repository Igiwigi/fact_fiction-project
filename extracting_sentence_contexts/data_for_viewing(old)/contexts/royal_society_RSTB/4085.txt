stone canal and the various structures forming the axial complex are situated in the same inter-radius
(9, p. 68). In this larva the (brachiolarian) hydroceele gap being reduced, pouch I of the hydroccele has
moved round so far that its apex is directed anteriorly, or even antero-ventrally, instead of antero-
dorsally (see Bury, 8, Plate XXXVIII, fig. 7). Little or no adjustment is accordingly required between
pouch I and arm rudiment I during the formation of ray I of the starfish (Bury, 9, p. 68).

Tt is only after the preoral lobe has become much reduced (ef. Plate 21, figs. 13
and 14) that lateral swellings for the first and second pairs of sucker feet make their
appearance, This corresponds with what occurs in the development of Asterina,
Cribrella, and Solaster and Asterias vulgaris, but in some specimens of
Bip. asterigera before metamorphosis examined by me, as many as 12 pairs of
sucker feet are already present in each ray. The circumstance is probably related to
the fact that in this species the larval swimming organ is cast off abruptly (KorEN
and Danrerssen, 46; Detar, 19), and, since there is no sucker which can provide
temporary fixation, the tube feet must be ready for early functional use.

Stone Canal.â€”The stone canal takes origin on the right posterior wall of the /.m.c.,
five or six days before metamorphosis, as a groove lined by elongated strongly ciliated
cells beginning near the inner opening of the pore-canal and ending at the bottom of
