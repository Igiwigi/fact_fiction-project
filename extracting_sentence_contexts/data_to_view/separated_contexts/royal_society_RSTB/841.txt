I often
© suspected the connection of some of these fibres with the gut itself, and am inclined
©to believe that a few, at any rate, form the nerve supply of the mesenteron,
However that may be, they mainly constitute the motor supply of the body as
2topposed to the appendage muscles, and form a motor system comparable in its
“GZuntero-posterior extension to the sensory system connected with the ventral lines of
‘Qsense cells. I stated above that: the ventral sensory system owed its antero-posterior
pextension to the fact that it is related to longitudinal lines of sense cells. Similarly,
‘Bthis dorsal diffuse motor system appears to me to owe its antero-posterior extension
Bto the fact that it is connected with a group of muscles, the flexors and extensors of
Sthe body, which extend from end to end in almost unbroken series, and are not

ees divided into disconnected myomeres related to the successive body segments. =
