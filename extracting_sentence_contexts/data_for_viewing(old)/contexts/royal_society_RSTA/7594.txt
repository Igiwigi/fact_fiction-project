3aand 4d). Reliable absolute measurements would provide a useful further test of the theory.

In view of the interest attached to type X peaks it is perhaps worth concluding this short
section by mentioning that Maier-Leibnitz and Dorrestein (using the same experimental
methods as in their work on helium) have established that these features appear in the
excitation functions associated with transitions to the groups of levels arising from the 3s
and 3/ orbitals.

4:5. Mercury

A great deal of work has been done on mercury, and from various comments that appear
in the literature it might be thought that there is very close accord between theory and
experiment. In fact, however, the agreement is only fair—which is scarcely surprising in
view of the complexity of the system. =

Calculations have been performed by Penney (1932) on the transitions 61S 61P and
61S'>68P and by Yavorsky (1945, 1946) on the transitions 61§-+73S, 63P>735 and
6°P, > 64P,. The wave functions employed were of the crude Slater type except that allow-
ance was made for the strong coupling between the spin and orbital motion; as evidence of
their limitations it may be mentioned that the oscillator strengths that have been computed
using them are several times too great. For all transitions (even those not necessitating
exchange) the approximation applied was that of Oppenheimer.f Unfortunately, only a
prior interaction was adopted and no results based on a post interaction are available for
comparison.
