peatedly over the same area at different stages of crop development has proved very
useful at Giza (fig. 13, Plate 33); we are indebted tothe British Royal Air Force for this
assistance, in the shape of six photographs at monthly intervals. Ideally, the series
should be continued until the full rotation of crops has been covered ; failing this, a
single photograph taken during the maximum rise of the water-table in a year of abnor-
mally high flood should be most valuable. A map illustrating the kind of result which
would be obtained is shown in fig. 28, p. 362.

The deep-lying detritus termed the “ sakia gravels’ is the most important water-
channel ; encountered at a depth of some 10 metres, it yields water to the indigenous
cattle-power water-lifting wheels known as “ sakias.” The rate of propagation of
the flood wave through it down the Delta has been observed by AUDEBEAU and by
Frerrar. Its importance consists in the fact that it offers practically no obstacle to
transmission of pressure changes, and relatively little to bulk movement of water.
This importance is often overlooked through the inevitable use of distorted vertical
scales (cf. figs. 6, p. 346, and 43, p. 378). The resistance to lateral flow through a distance
of a hundred metres in ordinary soil must often be prohibitive in comparison with the
resistance in a vertical direction for the same distance; the longer way round must
usually be the quicker for sub-soil water, so that the addition of fresh water in one place
may cause the emergence of stale water in another.

For convenience in description, we shall classify water-tables into four types, condi-
tioned by the soil structure :—Free, Isolated, Perched, and Backwater. They are
illustrated in fig. 1, which we are fortunately able to superimpose upon a drawing of an
