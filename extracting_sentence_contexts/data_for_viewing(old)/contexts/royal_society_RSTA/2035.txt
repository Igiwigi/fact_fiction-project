It is underlined that an identical procedure may be developed for the evaluation of the strain
when the stress is known, as often happens in practical structural applications. Specifically, in the
framework of the proposed approach, the strain ¢;, at time t, = nAt is evaluated in the form

én = — (Wn(Bner + @n—1(Bne2 + + + 2(Bn)en—1) + Ep AP ran. (4.9)

Note that equation (4.9) mirrors equation (2.182) for linear systems. Analogously to
equation (4.6), the value of strain obtained with equation (4.9) is consistent with the previous
strain history ¢,,_; and with the parameters 6, and Eg, within the time interval t,_1 + tn.

Finally, it is worth emphasizing that the quasi-linear viscoelastic model of equation (3.3) is
a special case of the proposed approach in the form of equation (4.9). As a matter of fact, the
discretization of equation (3.3) and some simple manipulations (as those defined in §2) lead to

&n = — (@n(Bn)er + @n—1 Bndea + +++ + @2(Bu)en—1) + Ep AM" lonl*sgn(on), (4.10)

that is exactly the same result that one obtains if the proposed approach is applied directly to the
quasi-linear viscoelastic model of equation (3.3).

In conclusion, the proposed approach is developed to appropriately compute the stress/strain
response to a generic strain/stress history of a nonlinear fractional viscoelastic material with
time-dependent parameters. In practice, for instance, the material parameters 6 and Eg could be
obtained experimentally as functions of strain to calculate the stress response to a given strain
history or, conversely, as functions of stress to calculate the strain response to a given stress
