other writers the prearticular. There is no doubt that Gaurr’s interpretation of
this bone is correct, and that PALMER is wrong in terming it the supra-angular.
The bone, as mentioned above, enfolds the base of Meckel’s cartilage and is pierced
by the foramen for the chorda tympani as shown in Gaupr’s figures. The second
bone to be described in this connection is the tympanic. In this stage, 11-0 mm. head
length, it is triradiate, the two dorsal radii running parallel and ventral to the
prearticular, while the third arm, which persists in the adult together with the
posterior dorsal portion, forms a semicircular rod of bone with the concavity towards
the back of the skull.

Palate and Upper Jaw.

The palate, beyond the fact that the palatal plates of the maxilla now meet in the
mid-ventral line, is little changed. The anterior palatine foramen is seen bounded
posteriorly, and for the most part laterally, by the palatal plates of the maxille, The
posterior palatine foramina are seen bounded by the maxille and the palatines ; they
are very different in appearance to those of the adult, as they are small and some
distance from the middle line. Also, the palate being much arched laterally, they
open inwards and not downwards as in the adult.

The premawille are now important bones, the tooth groove is deep and the septa
between the loculi are high. The premaxilla passes up the side of the nasal capsule,
almost meeting the nasals.

As stated before the palatal plates of the mawille articulate in the middle line.
