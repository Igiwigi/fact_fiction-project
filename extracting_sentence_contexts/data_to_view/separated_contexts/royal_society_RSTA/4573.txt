This supports the suggestion from Krylov et al.
[8] that with todayâ€™s drift speed and sea-ice circulation pattern, sediment from the Eurasian
coast cannot reach the North Pole ACEX core location in a single season. For SEASON, sediment
deposition again mainly occurs on the continental shelf break, and also extends far along the path
of the Transpolar drift stream, reaching the ACEX core site and recirculating also in the western
branch of the Beaufort Gyre (in the case of Eurasian sediment) (figure 4). Note that the transport is
far greater despite the fact that the ice season is much reduced in length (January-June in SEASON
as opposed to October-July in PERENN). The main reason for the faster drift speed is the thinner
sea-ice cover and the corresponding smaller sea-ice interaction term.
