for the time-continuous one. At the heart of this ‘Koopman theory’ for topological dynamical
systems lie on Banach algebras and Banach lattices, allowing a translation of properties of
topological dynamical systems to the language of functional analysis. In particular, the famous
representation theorems of Gelfand for commutative C*-algebras (e.g. [4, Section 1.4]) and
Kakutani for AM-spaces (e.g. [5, Section IL.7]) imply that the categories of topological dynamical
systems on compact spaces on one hand, and strongly continuous semigroups of unital algebra or
lattice homomorphisms on unital commutative C*-algebras or on unital AM-spaces on the other
hand, are equivalent. :

We are interested in extending the Koopman theory to the more general framework of [gS
semiflows on completely regular spaces. First results in this direction have been given in [6-10] :
for dynamics on metric spaces. The interest in this very general class of topological dynamical
systems stems from the fact that they often arise from the solutions of abstract Cauchy problems
ona Banach space E of the form

u'(t)=Au(t) fort>0,
u(0) = uo,

where A: dom(A) > E is a (generally nonlinear) map defined on a subset dom(A) of E and ug €
dom(A) is a fixed initial value. These, in turn, can be used to give a functional analytic description
of (nonlinear) evolution equations (e.g. [11-14]).

In this article, we describe a Koopman linearization of dynamical systems on completely
regular spaces (e.g. subsets of Banach spaces). After giving an introduction as well as a discussion
of examples and basic continuity properties in §2, we proceed by extending the algebraic and
