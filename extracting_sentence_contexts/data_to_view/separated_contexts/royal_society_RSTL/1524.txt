Should the necessity for such a condensing cause be thought
to be admitted upon too slight an induction, a more detailed
gupport of it will hereafter be found in the condition of such
a copious collection of objects, as will establish its existence
beyond all possibility of doubt. *

Instead of inquiring after the nature of the cause of the
condensation of nebulous matter, it would indeed be sufficient
for the present purpose to call it merely a- condensing prin--
ciple ; but since we are already acquainted with the centripetal
force of attraction which gives a globular figure to planets,
keeps them from flying out of their orbits in tangents, and;
makes one star revolve around another, why should we: not
look up to-the universal gravitation of matter as the cause of.
every condensation, accumulation, compression, and concen--
tration of the nebulous matter? Facts are not wanting to
prove that such a, power has been exerted; and as I shall
point out a. series of phenomena in the heavens where astro-
nomers. may read in legible characters the manifest vestiges
of such an exertion, I need not hesitate to- proceed in a few. additional remarks on the consequences that mnust arise from
the admission of this attractive principle.
