134. The case of the ellipsoid Fee +p=1 for s+1-dimensional space may be

worked out, by the theorem ; this is in fact what is done in tridimensional space' by
TazEUNE- DIRICHLET in his Memoir of 1846 aboye referred to.

Axxex VIII. Prepotentials of the Homaloids.—Nos. 135 to 137.

135. We have in tridimensional space the series of figures—the plane, the line, the
point ; and there is in like manner in (s+1)dimensional space a corresponding series
of (s+1) terms; the (s+1)coordinal plane—the line, the point : say these are the
homaloids or homaloidal figures. And (taking the density as uniform, or, what is the
same thing, =1) we may consider the prepotentials of these several figures in regard to
an attracted point, which, for greater simplicity, is taken not to be on the figure.

136. The integral may be written
