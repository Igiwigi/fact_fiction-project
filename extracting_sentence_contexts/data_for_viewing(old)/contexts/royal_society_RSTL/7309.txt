Brachial might be easily mistaken for the First Brachial of the other arm of the same
ray.

49. Third Brackial.—The general form of this segment (Plate XXXVI. fig. 6) is
more discoidal than that of either of the preceding ; but it still has a decided obliquity
(figs. 0, D) between its proximal and its distal articular surfaces, which is, however, in
the contrary direction to that of the First and Second Brachials (Plate XXX VII. fig. 3).
The proximal face (A) presents the usnal arrangement of foss for the lodgment of
muscles and ligaments; the surfaces for the attachment of muscles being here chiefly
provided by the two rounded lamelle which project from the upper or ventral margin
of the segment (d, d, figs. A,B). The distal face (B) shows a peculiarity of conformation
which we have not yet encountered ; for it is unmarked by any prominent ridges or fos80,
being in fact almost flat, except that it presents a series of slightly elevated ridges with
alternating furrows, which radiate from the opening of the central canal towards the
dorsal margin. The union of this face with the opposite face of the Fourth Brachial
(59, figs. ©, D, E) constitutes what was designated by Professor J. MULLER a 8Y2Y9Y-

50. Fourth Brackial.—This segment (Plate XXXVI. fig. 7) has the same general
form with the preceding, and the obliquity of its two faces (c, D) is in the same direction,
