In turn, these information limitations can lead to by selecting initial hypothesis distributions (Bayesian


priors), it seems likely that the prior beliefs of predators (such
as an innate bias against prey with certain colours) are also
subject to selection. However, while we would only rarely,
if ever, expect uninformative (unbiased) priors, it is hard to
envisage specific innate avoidances evolving for a wide
range of different prey types that are only moderately unprof-
itable. The fact remains that learning is a widespread feature
of the vast majority of experiments dealing with mimicry (e.g.
[13,18-20]), and most biases can be overcome if there is
sufficient opportunity and incentive to learn. Finally, although the idea that mimics remain imperfect
because predators have not adopted the appropriate discrim-
inative rules may seem somewhat obvious in hindsight, it is
worth bearing in mind that theories of deceptive mimicry
(in contrast to theories of Mullerian mimicry among unpalat-
able species [12]) have tended to assume that learning is
complete. As we show, this simple ‘information limitation’
hypothesis not only explains the evolution and maintenance
of imperfect mimicry, but also allows us to predict the
traits under selection in would-be mimics and conversely,
the traits that are likely to be overlooked by predators.
