on Az to indicate type, we have obtains a coupled system of equations whereby Price’s 5
equation is coupled to equations governing the demography >
of the population. For example, in the above model Price’s = S
equation (4.15) involves the density of susceptible hosts S = &
as well as the total number of infected hosts I (see equation =
Az =(1— %)-0+ (1) = %. (4.7) (4.12)). Each of these variables changes through time as speci- NS
fied by equations (4.13) and (4.14), and these equations are ==

Therefore, together we get coupled to Price’s equation (4.15) because B and 3 both &

depend on p.

ELbAz] = pBiS(—71) + (1 — p)Bat2, 8) The fact that there is an epi-evolutionary feedback
between Price’s equation and the equations for population
demography highlights that the direction and speed of
evolution can be influenced by the number of different
kinds of hosts in the population and how these numbers
change over time. The above equations (4.13) and (4.14) are
adequate for capturing these demographic dynamics pro-
vided the number of individuals in the population is large
enough that this deterministic description is appropriate.
For smaller population sizes, however, we need to account
for demographic stochasticity. Moreover, because the evol-
utionary dynamics are coupled to the population dynamics,
demographic stochasticity will presumably alter how evol-
