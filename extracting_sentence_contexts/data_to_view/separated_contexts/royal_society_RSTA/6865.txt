An equation of the type (A. 6) is to be satisfied
at every internal point, and for mesh points adjacent to the boundary some of the w’s in the
equation take the given boundary values.* The procedure is then to obtain an approximate
solution to the differential equation by neglecting A and solving by relaxation methods the
set of simultaneous equations. The function is then differenced in both directions, approxi-
mations to A computed and inserted as new residuals, and the process is repeated until the
full finite-difference equations are satisfied. When the boundaries are curved one or more of the points involved in the equation
(A. 6), applied at mesh points adjacent to the boundary, is a so-called ‘fictitious’ point lying
outside the boundary. The procedure here is to obtain an expression for this external value
in terms of the known boundary value and values at internal points, using the Gregory-
Newton formula of interpolation (involving forward or backward differences) and retaining
all significant differences. Equations for mesh points adjacent to the boundary can therefore

be obtained which involve no external points, but which are rather more complicated than
the general equation.
