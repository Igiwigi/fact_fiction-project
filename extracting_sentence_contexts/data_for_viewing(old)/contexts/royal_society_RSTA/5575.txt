general very high. The three classes with the highest agreement are IAVB, LAD, and Tinv. In
such cases, the interpretability methods agree that the most relevant part of the ECG to take
into consideration are the P-wave (IAVB), QRS complex (LAD) and T-wave (Tinv). The three
classes with the lowest agreements are PR, LBBB and CRBBB. For only four out of 24 cardiac
abnormalities (classes) the agreement is below 80%.

4. Discussion

The main contribution of our study is threefold. First, both versions of the framework were
capable of providing a local interpretation for a given ECG signal classified by the network,
by suggesting which ECG wave was involved in the decision. Depending on the class-wise
recognition accuracy (recall) achieved and the ECG wave highlighted by the framework, our
understanding of the decision process in place by the network may change. In fact, when the

recall is low and the framework points to the right ECG wave for the diagnosis of the cardiac â€˜=
abnormality, the network is likely confounding its decisions with other abnormalities involving : =
the same wave. For example, high RV values regarding the T-wave may mean that the network :B
did not learn the correct pattern to distinguish between T-wave abnormality or T-wave inversion, : =
but was understood to focus on the correct wave. On the other hand, when the recall is high :g
and the RV value is low, the network might be overfitting on the given dataset, or the cardiac 3
abnormality is not uniquely related to a specific ECG wave (e.g. AF). In our preliminary work [13], :3
using the LIME methodology [32], we found that an RF classifier was mostly relying on the QRS 8
peak amplitude for providing its classification between normal ECG versus myocardial infarction. : Ss
Such a feature is not related with the considered cardiac abnormality, hence the ML algorithm 7B
