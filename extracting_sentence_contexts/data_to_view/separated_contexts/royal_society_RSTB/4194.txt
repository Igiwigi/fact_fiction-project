These experiments show that when asphyxia occurs under cobra poison the

terminations of the phrenic nerves are unable to transmit efficient impulses to the
diaphragm. The other respiratory nerves are equally disabled. This does not
negative the view that the centre is also emitting impulses which are also insufficient,
but in view of the fact that the rhythm of the centre is unimpaired, and that the
peripheral action affords a sufficient explanation of the weakness of the respiration, it is
unnecessary to make such a hypothesis, for which there is no foundation whatever. *
_ It is difficult to obtain direct graphic records of the movements of the diaphragm
during experiments of long duration, and, on the other hand, in more acute
experiments the changes progress rapidly to complete paralysis of the phrenics.
