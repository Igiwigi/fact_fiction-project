kinetics at surfaces is amenable to modelling using statistical rate theories (e.g. the energy-grained : 3
master equation (EGME)), or whether more detailed approaches based on explicit molecular :8
dynamics are indeed required. : s

In this paper, we investigate these questions by carrying out a detailed study of dissociation 8

at the surface of a diamond slab shown in figure 1. Through comparisons between molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations and EGME calculations, we show that dissociation at the diamond
surface is in fact amenable to statistical treatments. There are two aspects which are key to the
accuracy of the statistical approach outlined herein: (i) the system must be separated into ‘system’
and ‘bath’ components; and (ii) it must be possible to construct reasonably accurate models for
energy transfer between the system and the bath. Our strategy for constructing an energy transfer
model for surface reactions is straightforward: we have developed energy transfer functions
which can be used within the EGME and which reasonably reproduce the time-dependent energy
transfer profiles obtained in non-equilibrium MD simulations.

Chemical vapour deposition (CVD) is a common way of making diamond in the laboratory;
however, there remains significant uncertainty regarding the microscopic chemical mechanisms
that drive deposition and etching kinetics at diamond surfaces. The specific motivation of
the method described in this paper is to provide further insight into the etching behaviour
observed in CVD experiments. In particular, it has been shown that etching occurs in atomic
