The first
of these is still a debated question, but the degree of fusion of zooids in a colony
has long been recognized as being of little importance. JuLIn, in 1892, observed
a migration of mesenchyme cells through the epidermis to form test substance,
while recently Brien (1930) observed a similar migration of cells to form new test
material from stolonic vessels of Clavelina. The test, in fact, is an external collagen
secreted by mesenchyme cells that have migrated through the epidermis and
especially from vascular processes. At the same time such cells apparently are
able to live and secrete tunicin only within a certain distance from the adjacent
epidermis. Thus the degree of fusion of the zooids of a colony depends upon two
factors, the distance apart of the whole zooids and the number and distribution of
the stolonic vessels.
