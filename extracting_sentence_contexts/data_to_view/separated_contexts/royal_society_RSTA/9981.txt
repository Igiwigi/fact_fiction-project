SE Se S| pe ae ee | Gee | peS BREA 8 ak et =. Comparing Tables XVIII. and V., we see that in both the amplitude of the
Z 24-hour term varies much with the season; but whereas in the case of P it is
2 conspicuously largest in winter, that is precisely the season when it is least in B.
3 Table XVIIL shows apparently a secondary minimum for ¢, in summer, but the
2 smallest value in summer is 13 times the value in January. The fundamental nature
‘@ of the difference between the annual variations of ¢, in B and P ean in fact be seen at
a glance on comparing the heavier and lighter full line curves in fig. 3, which repre-
sent the monthly values expressed as fractions of the arithmetic mean,

The phase angles a, in Table XVIII. show erratic variations in the winter months,
which are very probably fictitious. Judging by the seasonal values, «, is larger in
winter than in summer, but the difference is small compared to the corresponding
difference in Table V. In all the seasons «, is much less for B than for P, in other
words, the hour of maximum for P is much the earlier.
