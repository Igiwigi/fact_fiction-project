It is evident that no appreciable modification in the dimensions of the hore had
been brought about in making the glischrometer. The hevsnrements indicate also
the inorease in the section of the tube towards the end B,, which was apparent from
the previous optical measurements,

Length of the Bove of the Capillary Tube.—From the fact that the ends of the
tnbe were somewhat oblique, if was 4 olitter of some diffieulty to find the exact
length of the bore. When the glischrometer waa laid fit on the table with that side
undermost upon which the yartous marks ya', wm, &e, were etched, owing to the
obliquity of the ends the termination of the bors could nof be seen, and even with the
efohed side uppermost the termination was not quite detinite, Acenrvate readings
were obtained, however, by introducing u thread of mereury into the tubs, the
qoantity of meronry heing so arranged that at either end the thread expanded into a
spherical plobule With the etched side apperoost the points where (he hore ended
und this expansion took place could be ¢learly iade out, Measurements were then
mide with a Brows's calibrating instrument of ihe length of the bore inidicated in
this way, when the bore wae parulel to the tine of motion of the reading microseope
and when different parts of the sale of the Histriusent were vged,

Fron twelve measurements the uienn observed length at 15°95 wis

4°9318 centims. Corrected for the expansion of the brass seale and the expansion of glass, at 0”

this value became
4°9326 centims.
