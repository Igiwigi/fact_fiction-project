In cosmology, the energy density and pressure
contribute to the cosmic expansion due to their gravity, as described in the Friedmann equations
(2.3) and (2.5). Yet in general relativity the entire energy and stress is supposed to gravitate, and
not just the renormalized part, which produces a figure that disagrees with fact by 120 orders of
magnitude, as shown in ยง1. In the view of this obvious conflict with reality, why should we not
take the empirical fact of the astronomically small mass density, equation (1.1), as evidence that
the bare vacuum energy, for whatever reason, does not gravitate?

3. The theory

The bare vacuum energy and stress has not appeared in any experimental test of Casimir forces,
nor does it appear in cosmology. Should we still take it as real?
