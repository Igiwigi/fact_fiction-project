This can lead to observable effects such as gravitational wave
production or even vacuum decay. If the Higgs field has a high amplitude at the end of inflation,
it can also have a similar effect on other fields. In fact, it has even been postulated that the Higgs field could be the inflaton [1,3]. To give
rise to inflation, the inflaton potential has to be flat enough so that the energy density remains
approximately constant in spite of the expansion of the Universe. As such, the Higgs potential is
too steep for this, but if the Higgs field has a strong non-minimal coupling to space-time curvature
& ~ 10+, then the effective potential in the Einstein frame becomes flat at high field values [1,3].
