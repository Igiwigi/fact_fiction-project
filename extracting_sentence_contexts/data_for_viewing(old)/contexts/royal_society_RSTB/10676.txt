In total, 222 households were interviewed and asked about their expenditure for treatments the last three times someone
in the family had been sick. In order to capture hidden costs from lost income, the number of days missed at work or in
school was also captured, the latter because it is potentially poverty-promoting. Data were also collected on how much
households spent annually on preventive measures, including mosquito nets, health insurances, boiling or other water treat-
ments, vaccination and routine child health visits, deworming and vaccination of animals, treatments for flies or ticks, animal
insurances and other health preventive measures for both humans and animals. As it is common never to get a diagnosis,
people were asked for any disease.

The average household had 2.9 adults (range 1-10) and 4.6 children (range 1-11). The most commonly held livestock
were small ruminants, followed by cattle (table 1). Costs per tropical livestock unit (TLU) varied greatly, with many house-
holds not treating their livestock at all. (Owing to the fact that few people kept poultry, and only 12 people had treated them,
the cost for treatment per TLU makes this estimate very high; in terms of cost per animal treated, least was spent on poultry.)
