T. PRICK; A MATHEMATICAL DISCUSSION ON THE STRUCTURE OF

In the case when E = Ey Q -+ < cos *), for example, this product-becomes aw

taking ¢ less than 1. We observe, then, that this makes E, greater than Ey, which would correspond to Ey
in wood being greater than Ex, whereas the reverse holds in actual fact. We conclude
that any effect of the layers on the anisotropy of wood is quite overshadowed by the much
more important effect of the medullary rays.

$17. Effect of Heartwood and Sapwood, etc.—Besides the periodic variation from layer
to layer, the properties of wood may vary as a whole from the centre of the tree to the
circumference ; the heartwood may be stronger than the sapwood, or vice versa.
