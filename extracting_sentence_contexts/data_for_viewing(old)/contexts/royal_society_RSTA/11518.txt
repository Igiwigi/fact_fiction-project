gallate. On transferring the latter to the eudiometer and exploding with oxygen, it
was found to be composed chiefly of hydrogen, together with a small quantity of some
hydrocarbon which was not further investigated.

On several occasions we have obtained specimens of platinum black of low
absorptive power, which may readily be distinguished by the fact that they have
a grey appearance instead of the usual dead black. (Platinum black of this
description is apparently formed by the reduction of solutions which are acid instead
of neutral or slightly alkaline.)

A quantity of this greyish platinum black from a preparation which on ignition
in a vacuum gave off only 21 volumes of oxygen was treated with ammonia gas.*

After exhausting at the ordinary temperature, 24°83 volumes of gas were extracted
on ignition and were found to consist of CO, 4:2 volumes, O, 0:0 volumes,
H, 15°6 volumes, and N, 5:0 volumes.

The total gas extracted, viz., 24°8 volumes, is sufficiently close to 21 volumes, the
