If you
normalize all hexagonal close-packed metals to quasi-static, they all fall
on the same gradient; Ramesh did a beautiful paper on that [6]. What
you find with the interstitials is that you get these huge variations in
the strain rate sensitivity around the —100 to +150°C range, which is
exactly the range where hydrogen has its effects as well. You have the fact that your local stress states are changing, and one of
the areas I am really keen to have a go at is the nature of the interstitial
strength from oxygen at the fundamental level. I have been having a lot
of conversations with the Berkeley group about this, and they have been
doing some lovely work on it. Currently, there is a fair bit of work going
on including Imperial, Oxford and Berkeley, looking at aluminium.
