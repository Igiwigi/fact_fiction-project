without applying the electric current for the purpose of contracting the muscle which
ought to induce the contractions, adopting for this purpose any other stimulus to the
lumbar plexuses or to the spinal marrow. I finally tried these experiments, introducing
between the nerve of the galvanoscopic frog and the inducing muscular surface very
fine laminz of different substances. A leaf of gold and a very fine non-conducting
stratum of mica or of glazed paper being interposed prevented the phenomenon, that
is to 8ay, the induced contractions in the galvanoscopic frog failed to appear, whilst
a stratum of fine paper soaked in water did not interrupt the induced contraction.
From the whole of these facts I was led to conclude, â€”I1st, that the contraction in-
duced in the galvanoscopic frog could not be attributed to the effect of derived cur-
rents; 2nd, that it should rather be considered the effect of an electric discharge
taking place during the contraction of a muscle. For the sake of supporting this
explanation of the induced contractions by facts, I instituted a great number of ex-
periments which are described in the tenth chapter above referred to. With this
view I compoxsed a pile of entire frogs, and closed the circuit with the two extremities
of the galvanometer. Allowing the needle to become stationary, I touched specially
the nerves of the frogs composing the pile with a solution of potassa, by which means

contractions were excited in these frogs. Operating in this manner, I have often
remarked the deflection of the needle to be increased by a few degrees, after which
the needle retrograded. When the frogs were touched several times with the potassa,
or were very much weakened, so that touching them again with the alkali no longer
