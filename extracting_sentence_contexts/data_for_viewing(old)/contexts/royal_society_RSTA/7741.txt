x 2-11. Consideration of possibility of magnetic shielding

© It is normal practice to surround an astatic galvanometer with a magnetic shield con-
Bsting usually of several separate shields, the inner ones being often of Mumetal and the
Suter of soft iron. With such a shield external magnetic disturbances can be reduced
Bo say 10-3 of their unscreened value (see, for instance, Terman 1943, p. 131). However,
4 such a shield was made large enough to contain the bodies which it was intended to
“Gnvestigate, calculation shows that it would be very heavy and so very difficult to use, and
~glso very expensive. However, a more serious objection exists to the use of magnetic shields
Gn such experiments. Though they attenuate to a very small value an external disturbance,
“ahey do not reduce the field inside to zero; in fact, it is usually quite large due to the fact
hat the Mumetal shields will become magnetized by the earth’s field during erection. In
Zact the use of a magnetic shield appears incompatible with the attainment of a field-free
‘Fpace, unless some practicable system of demagnetization of the complete shield system

“Grom inside could be found.
