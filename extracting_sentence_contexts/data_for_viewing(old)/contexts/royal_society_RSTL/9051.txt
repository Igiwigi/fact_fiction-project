only partially absorbed, are but faint indications of what the innate metamorphic energy
is capable of performing, when the changes take place timely, 80 as to convert the
Axolotl into a kind of Salamander.

Tenth Stage. Skull of an adult Amblystoma opacum, 3 inches 10 tines long.

This is a North-American species, closely related to, if not identical with, the form
into which the Axolotl changes when its metamorphosis is complete.

The whole appearance of the skull is changed ; it is altogether neater, more solid,
and its narrowed, more elongate form is much more like that of a Frog.

In fact it has undergone changes quite similar to those which the skull of a meta-
morphosing Frog undergoes in passing from the short-tailed condition to that of the
adult.

Nevertheless the adult skull of the Caducibranchiate Urodeles and that of the
Batrachia are very different ; the former types belong to a lower and more Jateral fork
than the latter, but both are terminal or culminating. There is no inosculation.
Indeed, whilst the Urodeles may be considered as an upgrowth from the Dipnoi, the
Batrachia must needs have had ichthyic forefathers, in whom the characters of a Lamprey
and a Chimera were combined (+ Frog's Skull,‚Äù pp. 193, 194).

The process of ossification in the occipito-auditory region has been very intense, and
has obliterated all the sutural landmarks,
