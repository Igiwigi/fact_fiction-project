This is the natural next step to
explore using exponential asymptotic methods. Given the similarity between gravity-capillary
and flexural-gravity waves, it is likely that an analysis of this sort would share many similarities
with the gravity—capillary studies of Trinh & Chapman [24,25]. Implementing a computational
scheme for the full nonlinear flexural-gravity wave problem would be challenging due to the fact
that the different wave contributions propagate in opposite directions (as in the gravity—capillary
problem, discussed in detail in [25]), making numerical studies more complicated. Data accessibility. This article has no additional data.
