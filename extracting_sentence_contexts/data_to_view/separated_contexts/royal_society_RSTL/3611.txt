It was to the elucidation of these questions that I applied myself. In the majority
of instances it is impoxssible to ascertain what has taken place when a mixture of the
kind alluded to has been made; but the physical properties of salts will s0metimes
give an indication. Colour seemed to offer the best means of solving the problem ;
yet even here a difficulty arose from the fact that many bases, such as nickel, give the
same coloured solution when combined with different acids, and vice vers4. Sesqui-
oxide of iron, however, appeared to promise good results, since many of its salts are
intensely coloured, while others are almost colourless. The formation of the sulpho-
cyanide was first 8ubmitted to a full investigation ; after which other ferric salts were
more cursorily examined ; and after them a number of other binary compounds in
order to extend the range of observation.
