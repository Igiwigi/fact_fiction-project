flora should apply to these remains wherever found. Without entering fully into
these questions at present, it may illustrate the problem to point out explicitly that
if these two fossils are held to be remains of marine Algae in the Downtonian and
Silurian, they will have to be taken as indicating marine conditions wherever they
are found. If this is applied, for example, to the Carmyllie and Cairnconnan beds,
the Senni beds, and to the Rhynie Chert, it would involve profound readjustments
in the views of geologists as to the conditions of accumulation of the Old Red Sand-
stone. These difficulties do not arise if, as seems probable, Prototaxites and
Nematothallus were land-plants of peculiar type.

Whatever the ultimate conclusion may be on the question raised here as to the
continental origin of the Downtonian flora as a whole, this study of the plant-
remains has added a number of facts of botanical interest to our growing knowledge
of early plants. It has added some details to our knowledge of Pachytheca and
of Prototaxites. It has confirmed the presence of Parka in the Downtonian. It
has extended back the history of Zosterophyllum. It has demonstrated fairly
completely the morphology and structure of a new genus of the Rhyniaceae ;

Cooksonia has become the most ancient Vascular Cryptogam yet known in the
British flora. Perhaps the most important addition to our botanical knowledge,
however, is the demonstration of the structural features and the spores of Nemato-
thallus, which occurs along with Prototaxites as an important element in the flora.

._ NÃ©ematothallus substantially increases our knowledge of an isolated group of plants,
