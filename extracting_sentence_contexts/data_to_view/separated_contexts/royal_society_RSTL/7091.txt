A formula containing an uneven number of these
elements jointly is rendered as improbable, from our experience, as a formula containing
fractions of atoms. But the atomic theory in its present form takes no account of this
relation, and s0 little has this great discovery been appreciated that such formule are
often met with, even in the works of accomplished chemists; and indeed they are truly
admisible, 80 far as the limitations imposed by our actual theory are concerned. It
need not certainly be a matter for surprise or reproach, that the speculations of DALTON
8hould not apply to a class of facts with which he was unacquainted ; nor eyen can this
be regarded as conclusive evidence against the truth of his system. But nevertheless
this omission indicates 8ome profound defect in chemical theory, and if it should be
found that another view of the constitution of matter should cover the whole ground,
and account by one and the same hypothesis for both numerical relations, there can be
but little room for doubt as to which should be preferred. Another, although a less important, defect in our method is the singular unit of yolume
which chemists have been compelled to adopt, for which selection no reason can be

assigned except the necessities of the atomic hypothesis.
