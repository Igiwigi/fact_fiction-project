will be determined as above by 'TayLor's theorem. The n+1th term will involve the
operation denoted by the symbol C1, and it is by this term only that the interpretation

of © differs from that of Cavcuy's sxymbol, E. We have in fact

the complete interpretation of © involving two distinct elements.
It happens in certain problems that one of those elements alone presents itself, the
symbol © becoming equivalent either to & or to —C:;. In other problems they both

appear, but I am not aware of any problems in which the vanishing of one of the
elements is not due to some special cireumstance of restriction or limitation affecting the
interpretation of the symbol © in the case supposed. In a Note to this paper I have
endeavoured to illustrate the above remark by employing the symbol © in certain pro-
blems, in which Cavcuy has made use of the symbol of residues, and to that Note the
reader who is interested in the comparison is referred.
