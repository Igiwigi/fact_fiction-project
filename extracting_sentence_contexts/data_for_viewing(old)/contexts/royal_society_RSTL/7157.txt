increases to the eighth band; over the ninth, tenth, and eleventh, especially over the
two last, a shadow is spread, which gives to the red a rather brownish tint. 'The next
seven bands are of a fine orange and yellow colour. The nineteenth and twentieth bands
are very dark, the twenty-first is less dark. 'The following bands have a green colour,
varying in brightness. The darkest are the twenty-eighth and twenty-ninth, succeeding
the lightest ones.

The cause producing these bands and their shading by dark transverse lines is
evidently not the same as that which produces the shadow overspreading 80me of
them. This may be concluded, for instance, from the fact that the shadow which
darkens the nineteenth and twentieth bands, without entirely destroying their limits,
Spreads at the same time over the neighbouring third part of the preceding eighteenth
band.

18. When the light sent out from the incandescent nitrogen within the capillary
tube is dispersed by means of four prisms, the shading of the less refracted bands also
is resolved into dark narrow lines; but these lines are smaller than the similar lines of
the. more refracted bands, and their distribution quite different. If the dispersion
increase, in each band we at first perceive a new dark limit; but the design becoming
gradually more defined, we observe in each band extremely delicate bright lines
bounded by a shadow or by dark lines,
