proxy records over the last glacial cycle (e.g. Clark et al. 2002; Rahmstorf 2002).
The importance of the AMOC to climate lies in its association with much of
the total oceanic poleward heat transport in the present-day Atlantic, peaking
at approximately 1.2+0.3PW at 24°N (e.g. Ganachaud & Wunsch 2000).
Owing to the importance of the AMOC in the transport of heat to the North
Atlantic, the variability and stability of the AMOC (particularly in response to
anthropogenic forcing) is a subject of considerable scientific interest (e.g. Wood
et al. 2003; Meehl et al. 2007).

This collection of currents has traditionally been referred to as the
thermohaline circulation, a term which is problematic because it emphasizes
density gradients while implicitly downplaying the importance of mechanical
forcing by the winds and interior turbulent mixing. In fact, ocean density
gradients are largely set up by the winds via Ekman currents and surface
buoyancy fluxes. Furthermore, mechanical forcing provides the energy source for
