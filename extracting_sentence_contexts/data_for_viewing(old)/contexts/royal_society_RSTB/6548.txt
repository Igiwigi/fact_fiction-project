basement membrane (fig. 29, b.m.) is well developed and often in sections one sees it
separated from the epithelial cells and carrying with it the circular muscles.

The musculature consists of only circular muscles (c.m.) which are powerfully
developed and in number correspond almost exactly to the number of circular
rows of cells of both the gutters, and each muscle is lodged in a slight depression
between the two adjacent circular rows of cells. There is no trace of longitudinal
muscles in the larva of WV. fasciatus, but Harms (1912, p. 203) describes them as
poorly developed in the larva of C. canis.

While examining different series of sections, I was struck by a fact which clearly
shows that the radial striations in the bigger cells act as muscle fibres and control
the dilatation of the lumen of the rectal sac. As shown in fig. 30, the lumen is
reduced and is star-shaped and the lateral insinkings are very deep. In another
specimen (fig. 31) I found the lumen in cross-section was wide and almost quad-
rangular. The lateral insinkings were shallow and the epithelial cells (e.c.) com-
paratively narrow.

This curious section of the proctodaeum has been called the rectum by Harms
(1912, p. 200) and Lass (1905, p. 84), and the colon (“‘ Dickdarm”’) by PerFiLjEw
(1926, p. 116). Both these names are inappropriate for this section. Taking
into consideration its function and the presence of an anterior blind end, itis reason-
able to call it a rectal sac.
