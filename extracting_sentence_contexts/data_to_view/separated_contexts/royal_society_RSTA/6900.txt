The difference can be accounted for by an
8 attenuation loss of about 2 db./kiloyard.

2 The figures quoted above represent good conditions in the Atlantic. On the edge of the
8 continental shelf, where gradients of up to 1 in 5 are experienced and the bottom is ex-
2 tremely irregular, it was sometimes difficult to record echoes at all. This was attributed to
