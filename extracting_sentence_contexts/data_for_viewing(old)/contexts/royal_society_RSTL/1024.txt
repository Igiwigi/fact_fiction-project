a surface of mercury, and then separated. Tin, zinc, and
copper, which adhere much more strongly, communicate
higher charges to the condensing electrometer: I have had
no instrument sufficiently exact to measure the differences :
but it would seem that the adhesion from the difference of
electrical states must have operated in these experiments,*
which being proportional to the electrical energies are, on
the hypothesis before stated, proportional to the chemical
affinities. How far cohesion in general may be influenced
or occasioned by this effect of the difference of the electrical
energies of bodies is a curious question for investigation.

Many applications of the general facts and principles to

regard to the metals, the soda is positive ; and in contacts of glass with metals I find
it exhibits the excess of the energy of the alkali: the case, as is well known, is the
same in friction, the amalgam of the common machine is essential to its powerful
excitation,

* Amalgamation undoubtedly must have interfered ; but the genreal result seems
to have been distinct,
