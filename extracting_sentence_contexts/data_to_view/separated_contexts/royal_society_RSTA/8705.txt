The same phenomenon
is to be noted in the case of ice, the molecular heat of which is 8°6, whilst that of
liquefied ice is 18, again more than double. In both cases there are no doubt changes
of state with rise of temperature which account for the difference. The figures
seem to point to the fact that the liquefied solutes have like water a complex
molecular structure which is altered by rise of temperature.

23. Analysis of the Specifie Heat of the Solutions—The relations at which we
have arrived enable us to analyse in a simple manner the isothermal changes in
specific heat whicli take place on dilution of a solution,

If we put E grammes of solute into H grammes of water then in one gramme of

grammes of solute and ete grammes of water. E+H

: E
the solution we have present hau

s(E+H) = s,E+s,H
we can write As in the form

Ae = E (sw—ss) ae H (sw—sw) ,
E+H E+H

Since

That is to say, the specific heat lowering by the introduction of E grammes of
solute into H grammes of water may be regarded as the sum of two components.

(1) The specific heat lowering due to the mere substitution of

E grammes of
E+H
solute for the same weight of water ;
(2) The reduction of the mean specific heat of the water from sw to sy.
