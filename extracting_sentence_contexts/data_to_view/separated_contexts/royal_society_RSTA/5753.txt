We stress once more that the condensate (3.2) involves integration over graviton degrees of
freedom, and, as such, it is a consequence of (weak) quantum-gravity effects. We also remark
[44] that the crucial for inflation H* term in the RVM energy density (3.18) is missing in both,
the quantum field theory example of a non-minimally coupled scalar field considered in [40]
and the Starobinsky inflation [5]. In fact, we remark for completeness that the latter is based on
H ~ constant, rather than H ~ constant, which is the case of the RVM inflation [33].

4. Post-RVM-inflationary eras

Chiral fermionic matter and radiation (gauge fields) are assumed to be generated in our model at
the end of the RVM inflationary epoch, as a result of the decay of the RVM vacuum [43-46]. The
corresponding effective action for chiral fermions is obtained in a similar manner as its bosonic
counterpart (2.8).
