connection with the cells is, as Rerzrus (Joc. cit.) has already shown, by lateral
branches, The nerve cells, therefore, do not lie in the direct path of the nervous :
impulses to or from the ganglionic plexus. Exceptions to this appear, however, to
occur in the case of the small tubular fibres with thick neurilemma.

THE POST-GSOPHAGEAL NERVE CORD OF THE CRUSTACEA. 105

Internal Connections of the Posterior Pair of Nerves.

The first and most striking facts in connection with the posterior nerves is that
they do not pass to two distinct centres, and that a certain number of the fibres, as
Rerzius also found, do directly decussate.

On entering the ganglion the fine fibres of each nerve take up a position posterior
to the large fibres, and form a well-defined single stream which passes to a single mass
of fine plexus on the ventral surface and towards the median line (fig. 34, fpl.). This
centre, therefore, occupies the same relative position as the internal centre, or centre

+ for the ventral root, of the anterior nerve, Sometimes the fine fibres enter the nerve
S tissue of the ganglion at a point higher up than the large fibres, and arch round to
8 pass to the ventral-lying fine plexus. They may be said generally to take a more or
less arched course through the nerve substance of the ganglion and to enter their
