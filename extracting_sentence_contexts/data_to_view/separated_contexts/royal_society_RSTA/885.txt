Any single-qubit Pauli measurement on a qubit u gives a product states between qubit u and
the rest of the qubits, see equations (2.15)-(2.17). The sequence W cannot therefore contain a
single-qubit Pauli measurement on a qubit u, different from v, since u has non-zero degree in the
graph G’ by assumption. Without loss of generality, we can in fact assume that W is a sequence
of single-qubit Clifford operations followed by a measurement of v in the standard basis and
then by another sequence of single-qubit Clifford operations. The reason why it is sufficient
to consider a measurement in the standard basis is that any other Pauli measurement can be
simulated by performing some single-qubit Clifford operation followed by a measurement in the
standard basis. Assume that the sequence of single-qubit Clifford operations before (after) the

measurement is described by the sequences of local complementations m (m'), which exists due
to theorem 2.2.
