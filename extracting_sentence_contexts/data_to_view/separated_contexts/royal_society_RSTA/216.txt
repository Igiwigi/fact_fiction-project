Two main problematic areas were reported: accuracy anc
understandability. With respect to accuracy, evaluation participants reportec
that 51 per cent of the automatically generated clusters were useful, but 12 per
cent (standard deviation s.d. 10%) thought that they were not relevant. More o
an issue for users, however, was the fact that the automatic clustering function
was not easy to understand. Even after using it, interviewees were not able to
explain the exact function and nature of the clusters. Typical responses were ‘I’m
not sure where they come from’, ‘are they linked to the taxonomy terms?’ anc
‘another way of sorting information’.
