(i) The ‘tree’ pollen is restricted to Betula, Pinus and Salix, with Betula decidedly the most
abundant of the three.

(ii) There are present non-tree pollen and spores of genera shown by Iversen (1946,
19474), Jessen (1949) and others to be characteristic of the late-Glacial period and its open
‘Park tundra’, viz. Armeria, Artemisia, Botrychium, Empetrum, Helianthemum, Selaginella and
Thalictrum. Another species of similar but less pronounced significance is Myriophyllum
alterniflorum; since anther clusters of this plant were also identified it is not surprising that
in the lower muds which represent the open-water phase of the channel’s history, very
large percentages of its highly recognizable pollen should have been encountered.

(iii) There are present pollen grains of species which, although not yet generally recog-
nized as typical of the late-Glacial vegetation, have in fact been found in late-Glacial
deposits elsewhere in Britain (particularly in unpublished counts from the Lea Valley,
Essex-Hertfordshire). These include a single grain of the readily identifiable genus Pole-
monium, now of very restricted natural distribution in Britain (see § 4a), Epilobium and
Valeriana. In addition, we should mention the grains referred to as ‘cf. Ligustrum’ ; it seems
improbable that these really refer to the genus Ligustrum, but the precise identification is
still lacking. The grains of Montia now identified by Miss Andrew for the first time in
British late-Glacial beds may later fall into the category of late-Glacial indices; their
occurrence is interesting since the seeds of Montia fontana have already been recognized
(§ 4a).

(iv) Certain categories of grains are present in fair amount, but can only be referred to
the family, e.g. Umbelliferae, Labiatae, Caryophyllaceae, Compositae, or to a genus which
