The tendency to give E broods
is now definitely known to be inherited and strains showing this tendency in a high
degree can be extracted from sinistral stocks by selective line breeding. There is no
evidence that E broods are due to extra-nuclear (7.e., cytoplasmic) factors and broadly
speaking our results are compatible with the idea that they are caused by nuclear
factors or genes, though some non-factorial unknown is not excluded. The majority of these discrepant facts can be brought under one heading by saying
that there is a general tendency for dextrals—some genotypic, some only phenotypic
—to appear where sinistrals are expected. The reverse does occasionally occur, but in
our material at any rate it is relatively very rare. I. Cross- anp Se.r-FERTILISATION.
