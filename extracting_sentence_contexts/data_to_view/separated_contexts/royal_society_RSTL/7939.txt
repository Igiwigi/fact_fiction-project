J. W. STRUTT ON THE THEORY OF RESONANCE. When, however, the separate passages are sufficiently far apart, the constant & for the
system, considered as a single communication between the interior of the resonator and
the external air, is the simple swm of the values belonging to them when taken sepa-
rately, which would not otherwise be the case. This is a point to which we shall return
later, but in the mean time, by addition of equations (7), we find

&,+&,+E(6,+6)(X,+X4)=0,

If there be any number of necks for which the values of & are C,, C,, C4, -+ ++, and no
two of which are near enough to interfere, the same method is applicable, and gives

n=2z\/2utgt =, TITS (4)

when there are two similar necks &,=c,, and

n=v/2 x <3 y

The note is accordingly higher than if there were only one neck in the ratio of 4/2: 1,
a fact observed by SoNDHAUSS and proved theoretically by HeamonTz for the case of
openings which are mere holes in the sides of the reseryoir. 80 that,
