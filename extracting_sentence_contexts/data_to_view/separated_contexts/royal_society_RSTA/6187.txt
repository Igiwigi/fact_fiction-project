To pass to the limit also in terms on the right-hand side, we use (3.10), (3.11), (3.14), (3.23)
and (3.45) combined with the Lebesgue dominated convergence theorem and together with the
minimum principle for 0". Consequently, n satisfies entropy equation (2.11).


(c) Continuity of 2 in time

Finally, we focus on the attainment of initial conditions and continuity with respect to
time variable. Concerning the velocity field, we can recall (3.10) and by standard parabolic
interpolation, we observe v â‚¬ C([0, TI; LG, div): The fact that v(0) = vo is then proven analogously
as for Navier-Stokes equations, see e.g. [2,8]. Now, we focus on the temperature. For the attainment of the initial condition, one can follow
[1-3].
