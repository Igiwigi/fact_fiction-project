Cultural technique and material

According to Lemmermann (1910, p. 376) Anthophysa is an indicator of waters rich in
iron. Itis, in fact, generally associated with Leptothrix, the sheaths of which are impregnated
with iron. If there is sufficient organic matter, Cladothrix dichotoma, Zoogloea ramigera and
many other bacteria may be present. There is, however, often no evident precipitate of
iron compounds in the waters frequented by Anthophysa.
