Sn 22. S.c. chill at 680°, and chills at 650° (not reproduced).

This is a remarkable example of the polygonal pattern produced by cutting the
grains of solid solution composing the ingots at different angles, and so causing them
to etch differently, though they are probably the same chemically. Tilting, or
rotation under oblique illumination, does not much alter the relative shade of these
patches, and they show no iridescent effect. The bars of y are much scantier than in
the preceding ingot, but they can be found. The chill at 650° is very similar to the
preceding, and as far as we can see it is free from bars. Another chill at 650°, very
slowly cooled before the chill, has many more bars, but they are small and thin, and
may, we think, be attributed to the chill not being sharp enough to arrest all further
change. In fact, the bar pattern is so slight in all the above-mentioned ingots, that
we think it almost certain that the alloy passes through a region of temperature in
which it is really a uniform solid, as in the case of Sn 21.

Sn 22. S.e. chill at 600° (not reproduced).

We should have expected the bar pattern to become a real feature when the
transformation curve was passed, as in the present chill, but it is, on the contrary, a
very good example of a uniform solid solution consisting only of a few large patches,
which turn from dark to light when tilted. There is hardly a trace of the bars.
Even the chill at 588° is very similar, though here some of the polygons are bounded
by straight lines and may be massive bars.
