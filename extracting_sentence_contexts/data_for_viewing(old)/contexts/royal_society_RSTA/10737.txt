expressed in words will therefore read—

Total heat dissipated = Convection + Conduction + Radiation.
Or Emissivity = F,(p,t) + F(t) + F(t). «2. 2. (i).

Of these four quantities, two, Conductivity and Radiation, have been determined
by previous experimenters, and the determination of a third will enable us to solve
the equation for any value of t or p. The heat carried off by convection not being
directly measurable, our only resource is to determine it by difference.

The experimental results will be found plotted in figs. 2 to 6. It will be seen
that in all cases above about 10 atmospheres the emissivity is practically a linear
function of the temperature, from which fact we conclude that the loss by radiation
must be relatively very small. We may therefore write for any given pressure

E=m + n9.

Both the values m and 2 increase as the pressure rises: closer observation shows
that for any one gas they may be expressed as exponential functions of the pressure.
We thus obtain for the total emissivity an expression of the form
