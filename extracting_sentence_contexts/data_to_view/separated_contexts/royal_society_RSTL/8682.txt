Thus we
find that the epithelium contains a tisswe consisting of a reticulum containing in its
meshes lymph-corpuscles. If, now, sections of the epithelium covering the villi or the yillus-like processes of
the large intestine be examined in any animal, it will easily be seen that the epithelium
contains lymph-corpuscles similar to those in the follicles (see fig. 13). It is specially
easy to demonstrate this fact in the intestine of the rabbit and sheep. In preparations
treated by chromic acid and stained in hamatoxylin, these cells are seen to consist of a
small zone of unstained protoplasm surrounding a very deeply stained spherical nucleus. tn the following pages T intend to apply the term <lymph-corpuscles ” only to these cells.
