Pristivrus melanostomus. The evidence in these species points to a uniform
expansion of the cartilage. In the Carchariidse, the positions taken up by the
remnants of the membrana elastica externa go to show, as is pointed out above, that
there is an out-pushing of the cartilage along the diagonal lines, in marked contrast
with the failure of the sheath-cartilage to extend along the vertical and horizontal
radii, where growth is provided for by the superficial perichondrium (fig. 8, p. 354),
but, in some other Galeoidei, the out-pushing of the sheath-cartilage is, at all events
for a time, towards the perichondrial tracts, and not along the diagonal lines (fig. 17,
B, p. 365).

The arch-cartilages as a rule grow in thickness by a general expansion, as is
evident from the even spacing of the cartilage cells in such of the middle parts
as are unealcified, and from the fact that the calcified tesserse of the arches, both
internal and external, develop in a nearly superficial position, and retain this relative
position throughout life. Even in those cases in which the edge of the layer of

tessere is no longer superficial (e.g., Galeus; hindermost caudal vertebrae of Alopias,
fig. 10, p. 357), the result has been brought about by an overgrowth of the outer
parts of the wedges of perichondrial origin, and not by superficial additions to the
arch-bases themselves.
