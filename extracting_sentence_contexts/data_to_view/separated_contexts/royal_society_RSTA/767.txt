So
you're absolutely right it’s going to be a huge challenge asking people to
switch to any new form of heating. Gas central heating has been a very
well optimized technology that works really well in the British climate
with British homes. The fact that 22 and a half million people are using
that is probably testament to the fact it works. Telling people that they
need to change the way they operate is going to be a huge problem. What
needs to be done is convincing people that this is the right way to travel,
and if people are finding heat pumps and a switch to hydrogen are a better
and more cost effective way of doing things perhaps that’s the way to
get people to move down that route.
