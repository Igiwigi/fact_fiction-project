On the face of it then, linguistic structure
looks remarkably independent of the interactional niche, and
this has made it possible for linguists like Chomsky [30] to
claim that language did not evolve for communication at all. Here I propose two responses. The first is to point out that
there are in fact many ways in which natural languages adapt
through cultural evolution to the interactional niche, certainly
more than normally meet the linguistâ€™s eye. This section
spells those out. The second is to sketch how in fact the
very core of language structure may owe its origin to the mul-
timodal niche in which language most likely evolved, which . sae .
is the subject of the rest of the paper. 3.
