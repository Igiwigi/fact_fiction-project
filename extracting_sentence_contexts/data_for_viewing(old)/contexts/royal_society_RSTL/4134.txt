the coal-trams, &c. on the tram-way was inaudible. The Harton shaft is the down-
cast air-shaft for a very extensive series of workings, of which the nupcast shaft is at
the St. Hilda pit in the town of South Shields ; and the lower pendulum station, from
its proximity to the Harton pit, was constantly and agreeably ventilated with pure
fresh air.

The owners of the mine immediately proceeded, at their own expense, to make the
following preparations for the pendulums.

11. In the stable for the upper station, an additional brick wall was built round
three sides of the space (about 16 feet square) intended for the pendulum room, and
an additional substantial ceiling was constructed above it; and an anteroom was
constructed on the fourth side ; 80 that the room was in fact surrounded by double
walls and ceiling. The immediate entrance from the external air was into the ante-
room ; and from the anteroom there were doors into the pendulum room and into a
narrow room at, one side. [In this narrow room were afterwards placed the galvanic
batteries and journeyman-clock, and the lamp for illuminating the pendulum disk.
'The lamp for illuminating the face of the principal clock was in the anteroom, giving
its light through a hole in the dividing wall ; and the observer was stationed in the
anteroom, his observing telescope being fixed in a hole in the wall.] From the
gas-works of the mine, gas was led to a gas-stove in the anteroom, and also to a
writing-lamp. In order to make the snpport of the pendulum firm, the soft earth
was removed to the depth of 3 feet (at which level the hard clay was reached, which
extends about 90 feet lower to the first bed of rock), and the cavity was filled with
ashlar stones united with mortar at the joints: the surface was payed level with flag-
