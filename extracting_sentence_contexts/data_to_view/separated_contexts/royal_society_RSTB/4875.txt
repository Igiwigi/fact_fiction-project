Dr. Redfield has measured the slope of the dorsal segment of the eighth rib, and
shows definitely that this segment of the eighth rib is more horizontal—has less
slope—in the “natives” than in the “whites.” The mean angle which the dorsal
segment of the eighth rib makes with the horizontal is 16°2° in ‘“ whites” and
12°8° in “natives.” The slope of the dorsal segment of a rib is not an index to
the axis of movement of a costal arch, nor to the degree of slope of the arch;
the axis on which ribs move is largely determined by the spinal and other muscu-

lature attached to them; the lesser slope of the dorsal segments of the ribs in
natives does not necessarily signify a more inspiratory poise of their chests. Another fact which shows that the ribs of natives have a greater slope as regards
their anterior, or ventral ends, is the relationship of the upper end of the sternum to
the vertebral column. Dr. Redfield has used a costo-clavicular plane to indicate the
upper limit of the thorax; the mean position of the plane in whites is opposite the
middle of the vertebral attachment of the fourth pair of ribs; in natives the plane
cuts towards the lower part of the same attachment.
