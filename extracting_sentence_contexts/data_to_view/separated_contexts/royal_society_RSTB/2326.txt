The activity of the neurilemmal cells is a point in favour of the origin of the
medullary sheath from them. On the other hand, the association of the complete
return of function with the appearance of the medullary sheath, would rather be
in favour of the other theory, that it originates from the axis cylinder. This is
supported by the fact that in the central nervous system the primitive sheath is
absent. The axis cylinder and its sheaths must necessarily, for descriptive purposes, be
considered separately. There is little doubt in our own minds that, functionally, all
three parts of a nerve fibre must be considered to act as an oegaae whole, with
intimate inter-relations of a nutritional or metabolic nature.
