by using equations (2.15) and (2.19). The operations on the qubits in V(G)\V’ in the left part of
equation (A 2) will only give a global phase as follows:

n-k n—-k
® ZEisadioiadiy, | a QHD HAA x,
i=1 i=l
nk yi . nok
= (yea Ljai Kixjadj(vi,v)) ® xi) (A4)

i=l
The exponent in the global phase }); k Die 1 xixjadj(v;, vj) is in fact the number of edges in the

induced graph G,; = G[{v; : x; = 1}]. Let us now consider the correction operators in the right part
of equation (A 2). A qubit v € V’ will have a Z contribution from the ith factor if v € Ny, and xj =1.

1We identify 0 and 1 with the measurement outcomes +1 and —1, respectively.


Thus, we see that the total contribution on qubit v is given by

ZY, where yy = > Xj. (A5)
