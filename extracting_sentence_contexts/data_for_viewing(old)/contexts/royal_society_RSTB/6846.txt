Kuno suggested that the Japanese tridymite and cristobalite are primary crystalliza-
tions belonging to an earlier stage than the glass base. According to Larsen, the
tridymite crystallized after the lavas had practically ceased to flow, but during their
original cooling and as part of the groundmass of the rock. It tended to concentrate
in the last mineralizer-rich part of the magma. To a very small extent it was deposited
in gas cavities during the cooling of the rock, but after the crystallization of the ground-
mass. Larsen was apparently unaware of Kuno’s work.

(ii) Microscopic characters. The optical determination of tridymite and cristobalite
in the rocks of Montserrat presented great difficulties, owing to the fact that diagnostic
data concerning these minerals, as given in various papers and standard mineralogical
text-books, are either incomplete, ambiguous or contradictory. Kuno’s paper is an
exception, and his descriptions of tridymite, and his drawings and photographs of
cristobalite, are extremely useful. Kuno’s determination of cristobalite was confirmed
by Kazumoto by means of an X-ray powder photograph.

The writer recognized tridymite by its low double refraction, by its very low re-
fractive index (which gives it marked “‘relief’’), by the straight extinction and negative
elongation of numerous lath-shaped sections showing a cross-cleavage, by the frequent
occurrence of “‘arrow-head” or “‘ wedge-shaped” twins (Rogers and Kerr 1933,
fig. 133), and by its comparative freedom from cracks. To confirm the determination,
