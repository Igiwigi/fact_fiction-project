& The sme is fairly clear from the formulee, for in Table Il. we could reconcile theory
and experiment by supposing that at high angles of incidence Þ is somewhat greater
than 63? 44' 30”, and tha it decreases continually as the angle of incidence increases,
but this assumption would just tend to increase the differences given in Table IL.

Thus a small variable error in the value of Þ will not account for the observed
facts.
One point, however, needs further investigation. An error has been confessedly

- committed in the value of Þ. Can we assign a limit to its value ?

to coincide with the end of the needle point in the focus of the telescope. The tele-
scope was then turned to view the images reflected from the faces of the prism, and
the levelling screws of the prism adjusted until the same coincidence was established.
