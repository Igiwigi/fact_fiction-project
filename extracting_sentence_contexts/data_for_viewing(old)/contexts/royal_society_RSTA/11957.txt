fic heats of a gas we can calculate the relative rates

From the ratio of the two speci
of increase per degree rise of temperature of the energy of translation of the molecule

as a whole, and the energy due to the motion of the atoms relatively to the centre of

gravity of the molecule.
If f is the ratio of the rate of increase of the internal energy to that of the trans-
