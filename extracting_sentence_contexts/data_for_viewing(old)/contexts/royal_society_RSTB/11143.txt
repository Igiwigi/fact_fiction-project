texture, etc.) reliably activates an identifiable ensemble code of
multiple neurons, that feature can be encoded—and thus,
learned about. It may indeed be the case that neurons can be
shown to respond to approximate numerosity [54], among
other things, but this does not mean that numerical cognition,
in the first instance depends on specification of numerosity-
detecting neurons. Consider, for example, that the optic lobes
of insects (lamina, medulla, lobula (and lobula plate, in some
insects)) contain perhaps 200 neuronal classes, and together
comprise approximately half of the brain [55,56]. Although
many optic lobe neurons have historically been described as
e.g. ‘colour coding’ [57,58], ‘orientation detecting’ [59],
‘motion coding’, most have in fact extremely complex response
properties, responding to a wide variety of stimuli, depending
on eye region, spectral content and behavioural context, and
may at best be described as responding predominantly to a


certain stimulus attribute. Recently, it was shown that a neural 1.0
network with as few as eight of the simplest feature detector (a) detection
neurons was able to discriminate a large variety of seemingly 33
