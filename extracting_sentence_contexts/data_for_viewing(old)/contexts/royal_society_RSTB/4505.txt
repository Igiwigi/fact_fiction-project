eskers to the south and south-west of Edenderry. From them it is separated by a
gap of about eight miles, which might be due to subsequent denudation.

The Ballyduff Esker is exposed in gravel pits beside the roads going north-west
and north from Tullamore. The esker begins about 5} miles west-north-west of
Tullamore, and good sections of it are exposed two miles north-west of the town
by Ballyduff Bridge (fig. 2). The core of the esker there is a ridge of well bedded
sands and fine gravel with a slight dip to the north. Four layers of clay are inter-
bedded in the sands. These beds have been cut through by two faults with a
downthrow to the north. These faults were contemporary with the formation of
the esker, because the coarse gravel which forms the upper sheet of it passes unbroken
across these faults. This fact is fatal, for this esker, to the supraglacial river theory.
On the southern side the bedded sands have been denuded, and a coarse torrential
gravel occupies the hollow thus formed, and passes upward into a fine-grained bedded
gravel, which on each side dips away from the crest of the esker. The sands of the
esker core were obviously once much wider, and are the remains of material deposited
in quiet water. The faulting was probably produced by subsidences consequent
on the melting of masses of ice included in the sands, as after the faults were formed
powerful currents of water spread a sheet of coarse gravel over the ridge of sand.

Sections on the southern slope of the esker beside the road to Kilbeggan, 14 miles
north of Tullamore, expose at the base a coarse bouldery wash, which passes laterally
