35 economic sectors in the USA. For each sector, it includes data on the value and the price of
labour, capital,?” materials and energy, and the value and the price of output between 1960 and
2005. These data allow us to estimate a translog cost function for each sector and calculate the
Hicks—Allen partial substitution elasticities as in Salgado-Banda & Bernal-Verdugo [39]. We focus
on six major metal-using sectors: construction, primary metal, fabricated metal, non-electronic
machinery, electronic machinery and motor vehicles.

Row 1 of table 1 reports the own price elasticity: how does the use of materials respond to
changes in the price of materials, by sector, holding output of that sector constant. Rows 2-4 report
the Hicks—Allen cross-price substitution elasticities, capturing how the use of capital, labour or
energy respond to changes in the relative price of materials, again holding output of the sector
constant. As expected, we observe that, when the price of materials goes up, the demand for
materials goes down. With respect to the cross-price substitution elasticities, a number of facts
stand out. First, labour and energy are substitutes for materials in all but one sector (fabricated
metal). Second, there is a great deal of heterogeneity in the degree of substitution: the difference

2’ The input ‘capital’ refers to capital services provided by capital assets, for example, machineries and infrastructures that
have been purchased in previous years. The input ‘materials’ refers to various kinds of materials, such as metal, glass, cement,
paper, plastic, etc.


Table 1. Responses to changes in the price of materials. Asterisk denotes significance at 5% level. The numbers represent the
percentage change in use of the different inputs following a percentage change in the price of materials. A positive co-efficient
indicates an increase in the use of, for example, labour in response to an increase in the price of materials.
