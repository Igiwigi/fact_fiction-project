Although problems of estimation and of distribution may be studied separately, they
are intimately related in the development of statistical methods. Logically problems of
distribution should have prior consideration, for the study of the random distribution of
different suggested statistics, derived from samples of a given size, must guide us in the
choice of which statistic it is most profitable to calculate. The fact is, however, that
very little progress has been made in the study of the distribution of statistics derived
from samples. In 1900 PEarson (15) gave the exact form of the distribution of ,?, the
Pearsonian test of goodness of fit, and in 1915 the same author published (18) a similar
result of more general scope, valid when the observations are regarded as subject to
linear constraints. By an easy adaptation (17) the tables of probability derived from
this formula may be made available for the more numerous cases in which linear con-
