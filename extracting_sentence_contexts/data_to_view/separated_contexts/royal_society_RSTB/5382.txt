It is therefore needless to recapitulate the terminology of the previous
authors. Some of the parts of a developing vertebra were not known to Gavow, such as the
Dorsointervertebral procartilaginous piece, which becomes divided into the zygapophyses. Gapow thought that the intervertebral cartilage was divided into two definite pieces,
an interdorsal and an interventral; but, as a matter of fact, no such division exists,
the whole thing being one mass ; so that we have termed it the intervertebral. Gapow did not observe the connective tissue arches. The upper cartilaginous arch
has been described as basidorsal and the connective tissue arch as the upper connective
tissue arch.
