Mr. Ds La Rus (Phil. Trans., Vol. 169, Part I.) found a result decidedly 8maller,
the explanation of which is to be sought in the fact that in his experiments the cells
were making a current of about +55 ampdre, whereas in ours the electromotive force
is measured when no current passes.

It may be useful to record also a comparison between our CLARK's and a new form
of DAxIErr, introduced by Sir W, THoms0N, This cell is charged with zine 8ulphate
of 8p. gr. 102, and with saturated solution of copper sulphate. The zine is not;
amalgamated. According to Sir W. TromsoN's directions, the circuit of the cell is
closed through 250 ohms, and the E.M.F. measured is that between the poles under
these conditions. After the current had been running for about an hour and a half,
the E.M.F., which had been increasing, became fairly constant, and its value was then
743 in terms of CLARK No. 1. The comparison was made on April 8, 1884.*
