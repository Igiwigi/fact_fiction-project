series, one for Â¥y on AB and one for y on CD. The (r+ 1)th term in either series will then be
related to the rth term in the other series by an equation identical in form with equation (61).
Finally, the first term in either series will be the solution for y in the half-plane problem
relevant to the appropriate edge; this solution can be expressed in terms of the incident
pressure gradient as shown in appendix B.

5-1. Scope of calculations

Calculations of the pressure on the strip have been carried out for representative points
up to time f = 3-1. By symmetry we need only calculate the pressures on half the strip, but
since any one diffraction wave G, is not symmetrical we must in fact calculate it over the
whole strip and points Y = 0-1, 0-3, 0-5, 0-7 and 0-9 were chosen for evaluation.

The function Gy was tabulated from equation (85) and thence G, and G, were successively
evaluated from equation (86) using numerical integration. The values of these functions
are given in tables 1a, 1b, 2 and 3 where it may be noted that for Y>1 the values were
required for the numerical integration and thus had to be tabulated fully with the intervals
of 0-1 in Y and 0-2 in 7 adopted for this integration. For 0<Y< 1, however, values of the
G, functions were only required at points at which the final results for pressure were required.
The values given in tables 1@ and 16 for G, are accurate to errors of about three units or less
in the fourth decimal place. The values in tables 2 and 3 for G, and G, are subject to greater
crrors arising in the numerical integration; independent checks for G, using different
integration processes indicated that G, and G, are unlikely to be in error by more than about
