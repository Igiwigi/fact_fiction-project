thought to be a dyke (fig. 19, Plate 27). Microscopical examination reveals that it is
composed of angular quartz grains set in an isotropic ground mass which has the
appearance of a glass. This led me to believe that the “dyke” resulted from thrusting
movements which fused the surfaces and that it was in fact a pseudo-tachylyte. On
the other hand, several authorities to whom the specimens have been submitted are of
the opinion that it cannot be pseudo-tachylyte. In particular, they insist upon the
absence of crushing of the included fragments.
