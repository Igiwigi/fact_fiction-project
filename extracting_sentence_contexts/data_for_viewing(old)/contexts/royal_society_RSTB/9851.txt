of an impairment of personality functioning. In contrast to
neurodevelopmental disorders, differences in interaction
styles and impairments of interpersonal functioning associated
with personality disorders present later in life after a period of
relatively normal social functioning. Nonetheless, personality
disorders are thought to be characterized by alterations of
developmental trajectories during which relevant experiences
(or a lack thereof) made in social interactions may bring
about maladaptive patterns of thought and behaviour, which
can constrain and increasingly limit flexibility in social inter-
actions later in life [52]. This, in turn, negatively affects
experiences of social interaction in individuals with personality
disorders and can even lead to derailments thereof. In fact,
the clinical presentation of personality disorders is often
dominated by severe interpersonal dysfunctions, which consti-
tute an important discriminator for diagnosis. Furthermore,
chronic, personality-related difficulties in social interaction
can also lead to other forms of transiently present psycho-
pathology (such as states of depression) as evidenced by high
rates of psychiatric co-morbidity in personality disorders
(e.g. [53]).

While research in the past has attempted to explain inter-
personal impairments in personality disorders most often in
terms of individual deficits emotional dysregulation, behaviou-
