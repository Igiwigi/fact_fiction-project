the largest of the set of discrete values of 4 for which L,) does not vanish is } = 1/5

Even here the »* term predominates over the higher powers.


THE DEFERRED APPROACH TO THE LIMIT. 325

The fact that L,, vanisheswhen 4 = + 1/(s — 1) and when 4 = + 1/(s —2) shows that it
is not possible to choose 4, independently of s, so that L,, may remain approximately
of the form 1 — X??, where X is independent of 4, as s > 0. Consequently, as far as
the polynomials L,, are concerned, it is not possible to fix h so as to make an h?-extrapolation
valid for every s. But for Lg, it will ome to make n, the number of steps in the range |
large relatively to(s —1)®?®. . 2... eae .(9)

This condition is the same for all range Le ‘sida Yy shi diond, vf even on The
behaviour of 3° (a)/h?* and w8***14 (a)/h2*** must also be considered ; it is different in
different problems. If % be fixed while the integer s increases, then L,, vanishes as
soon as (s—1)? 221 and remains zero for all greater values of s. Let s,, be the
greatest s for which L,, does not vanish. Then
