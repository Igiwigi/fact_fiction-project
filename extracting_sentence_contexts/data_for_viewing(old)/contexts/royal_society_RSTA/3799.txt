derive an evolution equation for the quantity 7;;. To this end, we determine an evolution equation : S
for the fluctuations ui by subtracting the equation for the coherent motion from the original [83

Navier-Stokes equations, which is followed by a multiplication by uw. The resulting equation
for uu is then phase- and time-averaged and the desired evolution equation for 7; is obtained by
subtracting the respective averaged equations. This equation for 7;; is rather unwieldy, and further
assumptions are employed to reduce it in complexity and to adapt it to wall-bounded shear flows.

We first separate the linear terms from the nonlinear terms and consider the latter terms,
together with unclosed expressions (triple averages), as a generic driving term of the linear
evolution equation for 7;. This separation precedes our ignoring the driving term, because we
are principally interested in the parts of 7; responding to the coherent motion i/;. This procedural
(linearization) step can further be justified by recalling the fact that the portion of 7; which
responds to a vanishing nonlinear driving term is uncorrelated to i;.

Further simplifications can be made by invoking boundary-layer assumptions, thus tailoring
our analysis to the near-wall region of turbulent flows. In particular, the standard observation
of the streamwise velocity component dominating over the velocity components along the
remaining coordinate directions, together with its predominant variation in the wall-normal
direction, yields u = u(y) and {v, w} = 0. Furthermore, the principal components of the mean shear
stresses, generated by the fluctuating small scales are given by {w'u’,v'v', ww’, u’v'}, while the
velocity cross correlations with the spanwise velocity component are negligible, i.e. w/w’, vw! ~ 0.
Moreover, derivatives in the streamwise and spanwise directions are negligible compared with
the derivative in the wall-normal direction, {0/dx,4/dz} « d/dy.
