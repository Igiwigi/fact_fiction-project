other.

In the three species of Corbula examined the lamelle are simple, flat and
homorhabdic. The main interest in connection with these forms centres around the
interlamellar junctions, since the two lamellie of the same demibranch are joined by
septa, in relation with alternate filaments, in Corbula levis (figs. 41B, C, and D), but
by irregular bars inCorbula gibba (fig. 41A). The bars of Corbula gibba are not
simple horizontal rods such as occur in Astarte, but have a tendency to spread down
the filaments, and to run along the interfilamentar junctions. They thus form what
are practically irregular and partial septa. Further than this, they do not always
reach across, or only do so for a certain portion of their full extent. Whether any
great importance need be attached to the difference in the form of the interlamellar
junctions in these two species is doubtful. The difference is probably due to the fact
that Corbula levis, having a greater capacity for forming subfilamentar tissue than

Corbula gibba, is enabled to develop complete septa, whereas the latter is not. The
condition in Corbula gibba may, therefore, be the more primitive, or, on the other
hand, it may indicate a defection from the septal condition.

Solenide.

The gills of the three species of Solenocurtus examined agree tolerably closely in
their general structure. The lamelle are highly plicate, the plicee being flattened
antero-posteriorly so as to resemble the leaves of a book. The numbers of filaments
in a plica are about 80 in the outer, and 40 in the inner demibranch in
