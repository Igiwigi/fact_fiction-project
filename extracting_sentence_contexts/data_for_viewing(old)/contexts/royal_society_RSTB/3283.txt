the elements of the periderm, and of the primary and secondary wood, with the
exception that we have not recognised, beyond doubt, the occurrence of spiral
tracheides in our stems.

The Leiodermarian species, S. spinulosa, has neither ribs nor leaf-bases. The well
developed periderm composed of fibres, forming a network which encloses a tissue of
thin-walled elements, is quite unlike that of S. scutellata, though the form of the
individual thick-walled fibres offers a close comparison. The primary wood consists of
groups of centripetally developed xylem, either quite free from one another laterally,
or, as Sotms{ has shown, united in groups as continuous strands for some little
distance. The leaf-traces are also diploxylie, the secondary wood being well developed.

Yet S. spinulosa agrees with S. scutellata in the fact that the secondary xylem
is less clearly differentiated into bundles than in S. Menardi, and in the form of the
elements of the primary and secondary wood.

In S. spinulosa, as in S. Menardi, part of the parenchymatous inner cortex, and
the leaf-traces in that region, are preserved.

Passing to Eusigillarian stems, the Favularian species, S. elegans, described by
Mr. Kinston, differs from â€˜8. sevtellata in the shape and close approximation of the
leaf-bases. The anatomy, however, appears to correspond very closely. The structure
and course of the leaf-traces through the wood are practically identical. We have,
however, no information in the case of S. elegans as to the structure of the traces in
the periderm and leaf-bases, and especially as to. whether, in the latter region, the
