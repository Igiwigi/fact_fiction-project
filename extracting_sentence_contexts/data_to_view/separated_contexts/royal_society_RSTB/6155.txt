Therefore it is a fair presumption
that this harmful mutation has persisted in occurring throughout the history of
the entire class, if not for a longer period, and has been as persistently eliminated
by its injurious effects on the survival and reproduction of the affected individuals. At the time the theory of the modification of dominance was first put forward, few
special facts could be adduced in its support, beyond the calculation that the
magnitude of the selective forces in operation was of an order likely to have been
effective. Several remarkable facts were, however, soon adduced by a number of
different geneticists which strongly confirmed the view that dominance had in
special cases, most notably, perhaps, in the polymorphic species, been modified so
as to allow the heterozygote to resemble the more advantageous of the two
homozygotes, and so to give dominance to the characters of the latter. This
evidence has been summarized elsewhere (FisHer, 1930, 1931). The existence of a theory of the evolution of dominance naturally gave special
interest to the apparent exception exhibited by poultry.
