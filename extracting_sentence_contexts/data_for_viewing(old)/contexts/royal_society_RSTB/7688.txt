These facts indicate that the mosquito has a preferred retinal velocity, divergences from
which evoke compensatory responses. Three types of response were observed:

(1) change of air speed,

(2) change of orientation,

(3) settling.

In the original account of this work it was suggested that compensatory responses were
evoked whenever the retinal velocity departed from some supposedly ‘normal’ range: that
experienced in free flight in still air over a still background. This suggestion took no account
of the fact that the retinal velocity experienced under such conditions would vary with the
insect’s height above the fixed background, for this point was not examined in the experi-
ments in the small wind tunnel. The more familiar concept of a preferred retinal velocity is
introduced here in place of the indeterminate ‘normal’ velocity. By the preferred velocity
is meant simply that which the insect’s various responses tend to restore, and it is apparent
that what is preferred is the movement of images directly from front to back over the eye, at a certain
moderate rate.

Thus the various responses are not compensatory in the absolute sense of serving to
nullify all movement of images in the eye; that would render locomotion impossible in the
presence of visible fixed objects. Nor are the three types of response independent of one
another. They are all evoked only by deviations from a tolerated or preferred retinal velocity
and form an integrated system, one kind of response being replaced by another when the
