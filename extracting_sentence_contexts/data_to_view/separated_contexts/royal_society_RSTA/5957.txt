We follow the same loading process up to the different time moments as in figure 5a, and
unload at a very high rate of changes in the volume yy = 10 to obtain the instantaneous pressure
AP/Eo-volume change AV/Vp relations (figure 6a-f). When the shell is unloaded at moment
2, right after the instantaneous pressure is applied (figure 5a), the instantaneous AP/E9-AV/Vo
relation (figure 62) is exactly the same as the AP/Eg-AV/Vo curve for the elastic shell with the
same geometry (the red curve in figure 3b). This agreement is due to the fact that creeping has not
yet started and thus viscoelasticity plays no role. At moment 2, the local minimum pressure of
the instantaneous AP/Eg—AV/Vo curve, APmin/Eo, is larger than zero, so the shell is monostable. When the pressure is held until moment 3, APmin/Epo of the instantaneous AP/Ey—-AV/Vo curve
decreases to zero (figure 6b).
