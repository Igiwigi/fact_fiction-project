and appeared in remarkably dense, white, dusty looking films on the top of the
culture liquids: these films were so like flour in appearance that I habitually
referred to this form in my notes as the “ floury yeast.”

I have made no very extended cultures of it in detail, because, as stated on p. 138,
I found that it was not a normal constituent of the Ginger-beer plant; but one or
two interesting facts about it came to light during the examination of the pure
cultures, and those may be put forward in the hopes that further investigations may

be undertaken to clear up its life-history, &c. Owing to the gaps in my knowledge
of its characters—e.g., as to whether it forms spores—it seems unadvisable to give
it any specific name.

In the first place, it is aérobic in a marked degree, forming a pure white floury
