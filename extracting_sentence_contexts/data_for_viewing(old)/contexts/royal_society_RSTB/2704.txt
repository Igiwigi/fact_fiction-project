range westward to the Sutlej Valley (about 78°), Hipposiderus armiger and Chloropsis
havdwicktwi to Mussooree (78° 10’). No more typically Indo-Malay bird could be named
than the beautiful Psarisomus dalhousia, the range of which extends from Mussooree
to Borneo. Cissa chinensis, another conspicuous species, is known to occur about
equally far to the westward. Arboricola rufiqularis appears first in Kumaun (about
80°). Of snakes, an Ablabes has been recorded from Simla, and a Simotes from
Kumaun, but the range of Himalayan reptiles is not as well known as that of
mammals and birds.

These details are only a few of those which might be given to show the gradual
disappearance of Indo-Malay forms to the westward in the Himalayas.

The principal facts to be remembered with regard to the Himalayan fauna are the
admixture of Indo-Malay and Holarctic forms, the former prevailing to the eastward,
the latter to the westward, the gradual diminution in number of Indo-Malay types in
the west, the generic and very often specific identity of Himalayan vertebrates with
those of Assam and Burma, and the marked difference between the Himalayan fauna
and that of Cisgangetic India.

There is yet another peculiarity in the Himalayan forest fauna to which attention
may be directed. Although, especially in the eastern portion of the range, in Nepal
and Sikhim, Holarctic types are less numerous than Indo-Malay, the former comprise
more genera that are peculiar or almost peculiar to the area, Thus amongst
