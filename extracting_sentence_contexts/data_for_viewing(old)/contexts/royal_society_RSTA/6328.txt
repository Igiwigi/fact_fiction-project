suggest an orientational relationship between graphite, lonsdaleite and c diamond [1,20-22], and
it was argued to play an important role during the martensitic graphite to c diamond transition
[17,21].

‘The black hard carbon grains found in some specimens of the Canyon Diablo iron meteorite have been described as
‘diamonds’ since their discovery in 1891 [5]. Subsequent work has shown these grains to have a complex structure and
not pure cubic diamond. As such, in this paper we refer to these grains as ‘Canyon Diablo hard carbon grains’.


Early reports and numerous subsequent ones used XRD data for the identification of 3 |
h diamond. A characteristic feature of the X-ray data from both laboratory-produced and
terrestrial/extraterrestrial samples interpreted as h diamond/lonsdaleite are broad diffraction a
features. The broadness of the XRD reflections, as well as the fact that the most intense c diamond :
reflections coincide with the purported h diamond reflections, complicates the analysis of the
patterns. As a result, the majority of the XRD data were interpreted as physical mixtures of c and
h diamond, and the significant broadening was attributed to small particle sizes [3,4,23]. Even
the early reports [3,4] suggested that the particle size of Canyon Diablo h diamond was below a
few tens of nanometres. Similarly, Yoshiasa et al. [23] used Rietveld refinements for analysing the
XRD data of HP and HT compressed graphite samples and determined a small (approx. 1 nm)
crystallite size of h and c diamonds.

Given the apparent nanometre scale of the diffracting domains, transmission electron : S
microscopy (TEM) has been used to probe the structure of samples that are thought to contain :F
lonsdaleite [24-31]. In particular, selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns and fast : a
Fourier transforms (FFTs) calculated from high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images have been : =
