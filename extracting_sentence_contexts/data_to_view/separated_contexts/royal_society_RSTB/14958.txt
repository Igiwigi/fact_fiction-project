They probe this distinction through an experimental manipulation = =

synchronously. Similar to the famous ‘rubber hand illusion’ [111], this is sufficient to cause the participant to experience some © =

Payne & Catmur [8] find that this illusion is enhanced by greater initial conceptual similarity (operationalized as gender =

Such complexity echoes more general debates about the nature of human consciousness, which has been characterized as =
everything from a concretely embodied feeling [112] to a form of computational self-reference [113]. In fact, different people
likely mean many different things when they talk about consciousness. Damasio [112], for example, distinguishes between the © =:
protoself (a neural ‘mapping’ of the physical state of the body), a ‘core’ consciousness roughly comparable to the bodily selfand © 5
an ‘extended’ consciousness that includes autobiographical narratives comparable to one’s ‘identity’ or conceptual self. It is not «©
clear whether a purely symbolic narrative consciousness that was not built on top of embodied sensation would be possible or = 4
even conceptually coherent.
