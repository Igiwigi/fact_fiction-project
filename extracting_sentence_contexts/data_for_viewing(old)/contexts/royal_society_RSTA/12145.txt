medium filled with magnetic molecules which are under the action, from a distan
of a magnetic system. But the same peculiarities that were supposed to fa
beset MacCuLiacu’s medium and render it inconceivable, are present in an actu
mechanical medium dominated by gyrostatic momentum,

2. The general dynamical principle which determines the motion of every materi
system is the Law of Least Action, expressible in the form that 8 {(T — W)dt=¢
where T denotes the kinetic energy and W the potential energy of the system, ex
formulated in terms of any co-ordinates that are sufficient to specify the configuratic
and motion in accordance with its known properties and connexions ; and where ¢
variation refers to a fixed time of passage of the system from the initial to the fin
configuration considered. The power of this formula lies in the fact that once #
energy-function is expressed in terms of any measurements of the system that
convenient and sufficient for the purpose in view, the remainder of the investigatic
involves only the exact processes of mathematical analysis. It is to be observed tl
forces which can do no work by reason of constraints of the system tacitly assume
in this specification, but which nevertheless may exist, do not enter at all into #
analysis. Thus in the dynamics of an incompressible medium, the pressure in fl
medium will not appear in the equations, unless the absence of compression

otherwise redundant, which is combined into the variation in LAGRANGE’s manné
in certain cases (e.g. magnetic reflexion of light, infra) we are in fact driven to #
explicit recognition of such a pressure in order that it may be possible to satisfy é
the necessary stress-conditions of the problem, while in other cases (e.g. ordin
