In steady state, ecosystem C storage is constant throughout time with
ecosystem respiration outputs balanced by plant production inputs. The atmospheric decline
of â€”4%o per year (figure 1) represents the theoretical upper limit of decline that should be
observed for ecosystem respiration over time in a steady-state ecosystem. And in fact, the
decline of ecosystem respiration through time should have a somewhat less negative slope,
since autotrophic respiration and fast-cycling C labelled by the current-year atmosphere could be


50-75% (but not 100%) of ecosystem respiration returned back to the atmosphere [22,29,50,80]. The remainder of the return C flux (25-50%) is derived from ecosystem pools with longer C
turnover times [22]. Slow turnover C pools have slower year-to-year changes in radiocarbon
values since new atmospheric C inputs are buffered by older C already contained in the pool
[73,79].
