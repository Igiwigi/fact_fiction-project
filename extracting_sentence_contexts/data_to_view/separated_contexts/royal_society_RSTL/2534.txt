966. &c.) ; it
was then passed through the wires of the powerful electro-magnet (1056.), and again
examined with respect to its intensity by the same means and found unchanged. Again, the constancy of the quantity passed in the aboye experiment (1071.) adds
further proof that the intensity could not have yaried ; for had it been increased upon
the introduction of the soft iron, there is every reason to believe that the quantity
passed in a given time would also have increased.

1073. The fact is, that under many variations of the experiments, the permanent
current /oses in force as the effects upon breaking contact become exalted. This is
abundantly evident in the comparative experiments with long and short wires (1068);
and is still more strikingly shown by the following variation. Solder an inch or two
in length of fine platina wire (about one hundredth of an inch in diameter) on to one
end of the long communicating wire, and also a similar length of the same platina
wire on to one end of the short communication ; then, in comparing the effects of these
two communications, make and break contact between the platina terminations and
the mercury of the cup G or E (1079.).
