174 MR. G. J. ROMANES ON THE LOCOMOTOR SYSTEM OF MEDUSM.

the mutilated nectocalyx under these cireumstances are most unmistakably of a
rhythmic nature. Viewed from a little distance, indeed, these motions are not dis-
tinguishable from the natural swimming motions of the unmutilated animal, except
that, not being of quite such a powerful character, they are nob s0 effective for
locomotion. Viewed more closely, however, it may frequently be seen that the whole
bell does nob contract simultaneously, but that, as it were, clouds of contraction pass
now over one part and now over another. Still, whether the contractions are partial
or universal, they are always more or less rhythmical. As this is the only case that
has ever been observed of rhythm as due to a constant chemical stimulus, I have
sbudied it with much care, and shall now give a full description of what appears to
me an important body of physiological facts.

Ten to twenty drops of acetic acid having been added to 1000 c.c. of sea-water, and
the paralyzed bell of Sarsia having been placed in the mixture, an interval of about
half a minute will elapse before any movement begins. Sooner or later, however, the
artificial rhythm is sure to be induced, and it will then continue for a variable timeâ€”
occasionally as long as an hour, and generally for a considerable number of minutes.
After it ceases ib may often be made to recommence, either by adding a few more
drops of acid to the sea-water, or by supplying an additional stimulus to the bell by
nipping it with the forceps. Eventually, however, all movement ceases, owing to the
destruction of irritability by the action of the acid. By this time the whole inner
surface of the bell has become strongly opalescent, owing to the destructive influence
of the acid on the epithelial cells which overspread the irritable tissues. The latter
