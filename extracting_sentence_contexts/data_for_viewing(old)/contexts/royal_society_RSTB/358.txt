this vegetative resemblance, as my friends M. Renauur and Grar Sorms-Laupacu
wish to do, would be wrong. I have already shown that the leaves of my
Asterophyllites are not those characteristic of Sphenophyllum; and the fructification
of my Bowmuanites Dawson is altogether distinct from the strobili of Sphenophyllum.
It must further be remembered that evidence is now being obtained from various
quarters that there are Carboniferous plants, the branches of which bear both Astero-
phyllitean and Sphenophylloid leaves.

I therefore conclude once more that we must unite Sphenophyllum and some
forms of Asterophyllites in one and the same genus; it is equally clear that Bow-
manites, though its peculiar fructification demonstrates that it constitutes a perfectly

* The facts here referred to illustrate conditions so frequently seen amongst these Carboniferous plants,
in which the exogenous development of a xylem zone as well as the differentiation of separate zones of the
cortex mark advance of age. The fructifications, being young and temporary organs, seem invariably
to have a central axis, the interual structure of which is identical with that of the youngest vegetative
twigs of the parent plant. The Bowmanites described above is a good illustration of this truth.

distinct genus, has strongly marked features of affinity in the structure of its stem
to the Sphenophylloid type. Hence all these plants may be recognised as constituting
one of the several groups which collectively form the great family of the Calamarie,
and of which family the modern genus Equisetwm, instead of being the central type,
