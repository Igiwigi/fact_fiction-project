And a point of the conic U+AV=0 may be
considered as determined by the same parameter p which determines the tangent at that
point. As regards the conic V=0, the common parameter for all its tangents is oo, and we
may consider any other tangent of this conic as determined by the -oltarr gud 0, and a
point of the conic as determined by the same parameter 0. in the first instance, that the two conics are

U=ar+by*+c*=0,
V= a+ 9+ 2=0;

Suppose,

the equation of the tangent of U+#V=0, the parameter whereof is p (in fact a com-
mon tangent of the conics U+#V=0, U+pV=0), is easily found to be

/b—o/ati/atp+1V/c=a/b+kVI+p+ a—by/c+Ihy/e+p=0 ;
and if this meet, the conic V=0 in the points P, P', the parameters whereof are c, 0,
and >, 0, or say 0 and 0 respectively, then the coordinates of the point P are given by

w:y:2=/b—c/aÞ+0:w/c—a/b+0:x/a—by/o+0;
and substituting these values in the foregoing equation, we have
(b=e\/a+kVatpy/a+0+(ca)/b+k/b+p/b+0+(a—d)/e+kVetpy/c+0=
as an equation connecting the parameters p and 8. This equation may be replaced by
V(a+b)(a+p)(a+3)=>+pa,
V(FFDTHDCHD=>+6b,
ietpVeHD)=3+pe,
from which 3., p are to be eliminated ; and squaring and reducing, we have
M=abe+hkpd,
—2np=be+ca+ab—(p0+kp—F8),
#=a+b+e+k+p+06,

and thence

(be+ca+ab—p0—kp—k0Y—A4(a+b+e+k+p+0(abe+kp0)=0

as the rational form of the original equation. But the same rational equation would, it
is clear, be obtained from the system

V(E+a#+0)(k+e)=L+ME,
V(p+a)(p+0)(p+c)=L+Mp,
vV(9+a)(09+3)(0+ec)=L+M0,

by the elimination of L and M.
