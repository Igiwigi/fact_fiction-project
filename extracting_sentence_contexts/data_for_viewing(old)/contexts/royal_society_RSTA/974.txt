Figure 5. Hyperbolic tangent solution to equation (3.8), with e« = 0. The fact that a simple explicit formula exists for the
leading-order problem facilitates the analysis. See also equation (3.12). (Online version in colour.)

A necessary condition for stability is obtained by first determining the real roots. Keeping t
fixed, we analyse A = 4(n) from equation (3.5) in the implicit form nt = At(exp(—At) — 1)1. We
find that 4 is unique and negative if

—1<nt<0. (3.6)

Equation (3.5) admits no purely imaginary roots, and it can be shown that all the complex roots
have a negative real part (the roots of 4 = —a — bexp(—Ar) are studied in [40, p. 60]). The critical
point
