Jyas5es occur parallel to the lines m 2, or per- ©
gpendicular to the tension, while the dotted 4
lines mark the direction of the blue veins which are at right angles, or nearly s0, to the
Zerevasses. I have dotted the line marking the direction of the structure along the
Smargins ab, ab. In connexion with this point, I would refer to the instructive papers of
SMr. HorxiNs*, who has shown that in glaciers which move through valleys of uniform
'Swidth, the directions of maximum pressure and tension are at right angles to each other,
Zeach of them enclosing an angle of 45 degrees with the side of the glacier.
2 I have simply said that the structure in the case described is © associated with the
Spreszure;” thus confining myself within the strict limits of the facts. But what has
ij been aid shows that the pressure theory affords, at all events, a possible solution of a
g difficulty, which, without violence to fact, is inexplicable upon the hypothesis of stratiti-
Ecation; the difficulty, namely, that a finely developed structure often exists along the
Z margin of a glacier, while it is excessively feeble, or entirely absent, in the central
S portions,

= In many cases, however, the structure is not thus limited to the margins, but sweeps
across the glacier from side to side, without interruption, being as well developed at the
centre as at the margins. The stratification theory is wholly incompetent to account
for this; the pressure theory requires that to produce this transverse structure the
glacier must, at some portion of its route, have been forcibly compressed longitudinally.
It was not till after my return from the Mer de Glace in 1857, that the full mechanical
