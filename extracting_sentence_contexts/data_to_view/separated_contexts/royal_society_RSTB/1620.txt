The absence of such separate elements (and the same applies to the ventral
side) constitutes the only absolute difference between Amphibia and Fishes. VII. The vertebrae do not possess, and cannot form, neuro-central sutures, because
their bodies are exquisitely arco-centrous, formed, in fact, by the arches
proper, namely, by the basidorsalia and basiventralia, while the interbasalia
produce the neutral, intervertebral mass. Hereby the Amphibia differ from
the Amniota. J, therefore, distinguish the Urodele vertebral bodies as Pseudo-
centra.* The terms Pre- and Postcentra, as used in Ama and in certain
Jurassic Ganoids, are not applicable to Amphibia.t

* Tho candal vertebre might be called Holocentrous, because their bodies, taking the central mass
from joint to joint, contain all the four pieces of arcualia fused together; or they might be called Meso-
centrous, with regard to the median position of the arches with the interarcual cartilage at either end.
