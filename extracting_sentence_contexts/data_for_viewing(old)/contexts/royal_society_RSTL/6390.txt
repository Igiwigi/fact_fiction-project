appears sufficient to cause the combination of the constituents of the bisulphide of
carbon with the oxygen of the air. Such a combination certainly takes place, for the
odour of sulphurous acid is unmistakeable amid the fumes,

To test this idea I tried the effect of compression in the air-syringe. A bit of tow or
cotton wool moistened with bisulphide of carbon, and placed in the syringe, emitted a
bright flash when the air was compressed. By blowing out the fumes with a glass tube,
this experiment may be repeated twenty times with the same bit of cotton.

It is not necessary even to let the moistened cotton remain in the syringe. If the
bit of tow or cotton be thrown into it, and out again as quickly as it can be ejected,
on compressing the air the luminous flash is seen, Pure oxygen produces a brighter
flash than atmospheric air, These facts are in harmony with the above explanation,
