The red areas indicate a reduction in the recognition ability of the model when a particular location is occluded, while the blue areas indicate the
opposite. The colour bars indicate the appropriate probabilistic scale for each instance. (b) Average of the occlusion analysis in the KDEF dataset projected on the
