with V.v =0 since we consider an incompressible fluid; and Ampére’s law for a conducting fluid

becomes

* + Agv.Vb =A3b.Vv + nV2b + fy, (3.14)

which is to be supplemented by Maxwell’s equation V.b = 0. Here, A1,A2,43 are the nonlinear
coupling constants. A pair of equations for scalar c and velocity v having formally similar
structures as the MHD equations (3.13) and (3.14) govern the dynamics of binary fluid turbulence.
It is well known that both binary fluid and MHD turbulence display turbulence-like behaviour
for sufficiently strong external forces. In fact all the relevant dynamical variables v, b and c display
multiscaling [13,27]. With that analogy in mind, it may be concluded that both u and u, should
display turbulence-like behaviour. Thus, it is reasonable to expect that even with the couplings
with u,, uy should show turbulent-like behaviour for sufficiently large Fy. This in turn should
imply, via the coupling of u, with uj in equation (2.5) that u, should show turbulent behaviour
for sufficiently large pulling forces. Then again with the quenched disorders included, both u
and u, should continue to display multiscaling that generalizes the scaling displayed by w) and
