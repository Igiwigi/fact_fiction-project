As to the magnitude of the stress reduction which, according to the view here put
forward, may accompany the dislocation within an individual grain, nothing definite
can be stated. There are some grounds for supposing that the stress may even be
reduced to zero. The fact, for instance, that when the external load is reversed plastic
flow may, as shown by Roperrson, commence at zero load, would suggest that this
