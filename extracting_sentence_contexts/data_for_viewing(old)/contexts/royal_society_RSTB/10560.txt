statistics, we simulated learning of a ‘community structure’
sequence that cannot be parsed based on transition probability
or joint frequency [5,19]. The sequence was generated via a
random walk on a graph (figure 3b) with three densely inter-
connected ‘communities’ of nodes [41]. The walk tends to
stay in a community for a while before transitioning to the
next, but any individual node has an equal probability of tran-
sitioning to exactly four other nodes. We constrained the
sequences such that the observed joint frequencies were exactly
equated in each epoch (as opposed to equated on average).
Thus, transition probabilities did not provide information
about the location of community boundaries. To learn these
boundaries, it was necessary to pick up on the fact that
nodes in the same community were connected to overlapping
sets of other nodes, whereas nodes from different communities
were not.

The only change to the architecture and parameters for this
simulation was the addition of seven units to EC;,, and EC,,,; to
accommodate the 15 nodes in the graph (versus the eight
paired items). We exposed the model to sequences in the
same way as for the pair structure paradigm, with two items
presented at a time in a moving window and the previous
