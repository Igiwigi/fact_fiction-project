= This method is the simplest, and could usually be made to work satisfactorily. It

, however, open to the objection that if the current changes rapidly we musb either
Flow for a considerable galvanometer displacement or else alter the auxiliary resist-
noe. But the latter change reacts upon the principal current, and renders the
Errent weighing curves discontinuous, thereby increasing the difficulty of specifying

Hhe value of the current at the moment of observation.

$35. In the second method the resistance between the points of derivation is the
£ 8imply, and compensation is made in the galvanometer branch by the introduction
ES a graduated E.M.F. (Plate 17 fig. 1). The arrangement is in fact almost the game as
H the comparison of two cells by the method of difference (F 28), one of the cells being
Splaced by the resistance [4] traversed by the main current. As the apparatus for
Hhese comparisons was always ready for use, this method was, under the circumstances
If the case, really more convenient than the other, and was employed in the later

terminations. The procedure will be best understood from an example.
— On March 29, 1884, determinations of silver and of electromotive force were made
Ymultaneously, 80 that the same set of current weighings might serve for both pur-
Poses. Accordingly the main current traversed the three voltameters, the currenc
Feighing apparatus and the resistance [4]. In the derived branch (Plate 17, fig. 1)
were the standard cell No. 4 CLARK, the galvanometer with its commutator, tf
coils from a resistance box, through which passed the current from the two LECLANCHE
