if the group Streptophiuree is to stand it cannot be defined by the character of its
vertebral. ossicles, and in seeking relatives of Onychaster among more modern forms
we are limited to the Zygophiuree.

Let us first consider the articulation only, neglecting the form of the vertebra. In
any Zygophiurid, as we know, the articulation is characterised by a change from a
condition of opisthocoely in the dorsal region to one of procoely below, if we may so

express it. In Onychaster, as we have stated, there are three regions, and these
three merge more or less into one another, owing to the fact that the processes are
local developments of a pair of ridges. In cross-sections there is at one level obvious
similarity to a section of a Zygophiurid vertebra taken through the peg and paired
ventro-lateral sockets, This is in the neighbourhood of the radial canal. It is clear
that if we suppose the radial canal to sink, and its place to fill up with skeletal
tissue, we should then have a posterior knob and paired sockets at its sides, and
correspondingly an anterior pit and paired knobs (compare fig. 1B, and Plate 9,
fig. 3). The latter are very closely embraced by the outer walls of the sockets.
Passing upwards from this level, we find throughout the greater length of the arm
that these embracing walls retreat, the paired ridges on the anterior surface
broadening out and fitting, as we have said, into shallow grooves, open at their outer
or interradial border. But in the neighbourhood of the mouth, the vertebrae A,â€”A;
show a modification; the embracing ridges on the posterior surface are greatly
