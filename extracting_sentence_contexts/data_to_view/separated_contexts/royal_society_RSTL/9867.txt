DEBUS ON THE CHEMICAL THEORY OF GUNPOWDER.

sulphur, which sball, of all possible mixtures of this nature, possess the greatest,
energy ; the resnlts 80 obtained will be nearly correct for ordinary gunpowders,
'This would be the most general form of the problem of the explosion of gunpowder
which could be proposed for solution to a chemist, . Equations (IX.) and (X.), viz. :—

V=32+iy+HÞ 0700007 009006 2
W=1000[1827-154—16:925y—8*7882] 41 + 210/87 ol (X.)

at once show that, if for a given weight of saltpetre, 16 mols., the carbon and sulphur
of the mixture were allowed to increase, the volume of gas generated by combustion
would likewise increase, but the quantity of heat will grow smaller, and if the carbon
and sulphur be diminished the gas will also become less, but the heat of combustion
will increase. NoBLE and ABEL have called attention to the fact* that the products of heat and
gas obtained by them in their various experiments with different descriptions of
powder do nob differ much from each other. The explanation of this interesting
observation is to be found in equations (IX.) and (X.). The work which can be performed by a given weight of powder will, ceteris paribus,
be proportional to the volume of gas and amount of heat, respectively, which the
powder can produce by its combustion, and hence, will be proportional to the product
of both.
