From the very wide variations found in different specimens of the same species, and
from the feeding experiments described below, we must conclude that the proportion
between vesicular tissue and intervesicular tissue varies under different physiological
conditions. B. Parathyroid.â€”The parathyroid in the pigeon differs strikingly in its general
appearance from the corresponding structure in other animals. But this difference
appears to be simply due to the fact that the epithelial cells contain an abundance of
fat, and that they become extensively vacuolated during the process of preparation
for the microscope. Unlike the parathyroids of reptiles, those of birds appear to
have no lumen in the masses of cells (Plate 12, fig. 11, pthyr.).
