Moreover, the few facts detailed in this paper show that the habits of these crea-
tures, although hitherto comparatively neglected, are as interesting to the naturalist
as those of the more extensively investigated divisions of other Articulata.

But it is in the evolution of the embryo that the facts ascertained appear to be of
the greatest interest. In conformity with the views of Scawaxx and SCHLEIDEN, and
of our own accurate observer, Dr. Marmix Barmy, the embryo of Julus in its earlier
stages is found to be composed entirely of a congeries of cells, thus assimilating in
origin the animal to the vegetable creation. But in the higher animals, as is well
known, in which, chiefly, this subject has been studied, the changes which the future
being undergoes in this stage of its existence are 80 exceedingly rapid, that it is with
great difficulty that the facts connected with them are ascertained. In the embryo
of the Myriapoda these changes are more gradual, and the transitions more slowly
marked. Besides confirming the statements of Savr and Waca regarding the apodal
condition of the embryo at the bursting of its shell, and its hexapodal state at a later
period, I have noticed the important additional facts of the detection of the amnion
and chorion [?] which inclosed the embryo, and also the insertion of the funis at the
posterior margin of the penultimate segment of the body, instead of at the dorsal part
of the thoracic region, as seen by Raruke in Crustacea; thus more closely identifying
the structures of the embryo, as well as those of the ovum in Myriapoda, with similar
structures in the ovum, and its development. in the higher classes, and further illus-
trating the persistence of one general law or principle in the development of ani-
mated beings.
