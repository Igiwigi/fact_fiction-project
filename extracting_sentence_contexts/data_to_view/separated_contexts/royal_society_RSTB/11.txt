Moreover, the stomata on the upper
surface appear to be more numerous: on the lower surface the stomata seem to be
larger, but I cannot say they are more numerous. The stomata have wider
openings in the damp shaded plants, and the cell walls of all the parts are thinner
and more watery; of course it may be assumed that there is more aqueous vapour in
the intercellular spaces, ‘Taking all these facts into consideration, I see no difficulty
in explaining the differences in the times occupied in infections; and they also throw

conditions existing. I have other facts in other connections which bear out this, and
I hope some time to be able to devote special and continuous attention to this
question. i

I do not propose to enlarge upon the subject of the resting-spores. After some
months in the dormant condition they put forth promycelial tubes, from which
