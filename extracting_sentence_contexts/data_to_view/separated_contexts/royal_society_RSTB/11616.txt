These effects are weighted by appears to increase over the course of infection. However,

the proportion of all infections that are of age s, ie. q(s), and the rate at which this increase occurred depended on a

fact that virulence at infection age s can influence evolutionary
change in the transmission rate at age a, given some genetic
covariance between them, G),(a,s). These effects are again
weighted by the proportion of all infections that are of age s,
q(s), but also by the reproductive value of those infections, o(s),

of increase in spores over time was almost identical between

virulence ends infections).
