parent Progrediens, which should, in accordance with the established alternation of
form, give rise only to Sistentes, and subsequently increases at the expense of the
Sistens type.

Lastly, the Sistens type, after a great number of generations, makes its appearance
amongst the offspring of the parent Sistens, which should give rise only to the
Progrediens-Sexupara type, which it finally eliminates. °

Now the Sexupara is clearly a true dimorphism of the Progrediens, and, owing to
Borner’s observation that a single individual Sistens will give rise to larve of the
Sistens and Progrediens type, both he and Marcnan (4) uphold that the Progrediens
is also a dimorphism of the Sistens, the latter even going so far as to suggest that
the dimorphism in this case has arisen by mutation. From the facts which research
upon isolated stocks of known origin have brought to light, we cannot hold the view
of those authors who laid no stress upon the clear existence of an alternation of form
in the successive generations of the main cycle upon both host-plants.

In the case of Cnaphalodes strobilobius, it has been demonstrated that a regular
alternation of form is pursued in successive generations until the third year of
parthenogenetic reproduction upon the Larch. At this point the Progrediens gives
rise to a small number of Progredientes amongst a majority of Sistentes, This is a
clear divergence from the normal procedure of reproduction, and does not constitute a
true dimorphism in the Sistens and Progrediens types.

The abnormally-produced Progredientes, indeed, rectify the divergence, by giving
