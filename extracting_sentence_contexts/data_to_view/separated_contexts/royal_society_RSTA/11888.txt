If this is also
—as Mr. GrirrirHs suggests as probable—in close agreement with the mean calorie,
0° to 100°, then the mean specific heat from 12 to 100 should come out only a very
little less than unity. In fact, by plotting Barrort and Srracctatt’s observations
below 15°, we can estimate what the mean specific heat from 12° to 100° ought to be
if the mean from 0 to 100 is the same as the specific heat at 15° and both equal
unity. A rough estimate gives this to be 0°9995. My value is therefore too low to be in harmony with the supposition that the mean
calorie and the 15° unit are identical.
