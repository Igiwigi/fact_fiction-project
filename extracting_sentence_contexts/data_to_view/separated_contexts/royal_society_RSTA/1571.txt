in which in contrast to (1), (2) and (3) there is no need for a special statement about sign. The equations are much simplified by the fact that the upward speed is usually much
greater than the horizontal relative speed. For example, in a uniform wind of 10 m/s.
the steel ball, the size of a pea, is shot up with a muzzle speed of 150 m/s, at a tilt of
0-15 radian and reaches the earth again with a speed of 37 m/s. So as the ball emerges from the muzzle
