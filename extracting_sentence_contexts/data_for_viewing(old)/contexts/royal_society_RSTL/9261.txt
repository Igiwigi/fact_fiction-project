(ec) Now we have here to deal with a class of facts which physiologists will recognize
as of a perfectly novel character. Why it should be that the very tenuous tracts of tisswe |
which I have named should have the property of responding even to a feeble 8timulus
by issing an impulse of a kind which throws the contractile tissnes into a spasm ;
why it should be that a spasm, when 80 originated, should manifest a power of pene-
tration to which the normal contractions of the tissues in which it occurs bear 80 8mall
a proportion ; why it is that the contractile tissues should be s0 deficient in the power
of originating a spasm, even in response to the strongest stimulation applied to them-
selves—these and other questions at once suggest themselves as questions of the highest
interest: at present, however, I am wholly unable to answer them. 'To assume that
it is the ganglionic element in the margin, and possibly also in the radial tubes, which
responds to direct stimulation by discharging a peculiar impulse which has the remark-
able effect in question—to assume this is not to explain the facts, For the sake of
rendering the matter quite clear, let us employ a somewhat far-fetched but convenient
metaphor, We may compare the general contractile tissues of this Medusa to a mass
of gun-cotton, which responds to ignition (direct stimulation) by burning with a quiet

to each cut of the contractile tisswes with a locomotor contraction (or it may not respond at all); but overy

behind it immediately go into a spasm.
