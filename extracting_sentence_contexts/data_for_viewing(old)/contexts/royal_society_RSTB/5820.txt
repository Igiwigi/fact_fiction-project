seen in many roots with secondary growth like those described above (fig. 20, Plate 7).

Diagnosis.—In view of the facts now described we may re-define the genus Zygopteris
as follows :—

Genus Zygopteris, Corpa, emend. SAHNI.

Stele cylindrical, with a stellate core of primary xylem and a thick outer zone of
secondary wood. Leaf-trace at first mesarch, with a complete sheath of secondary
wood (which may extend into the petiole) ; then a tangentially extended band with a

* The Matoniaceous resemblance here strongly hinted need not be seriously considered till we know the
facts better.

+ Diarch roots, with steles almost identical in structure with those here shown in figs. 19, 24, Plate 7,
are to be seen in slides 2158 and 2550 of the Scott Collection (Brit. Mus.).

temporary abaxial curvature and two lateral protoxylems: final form and mode of
branching as in Etapteris. Pinne biseriate, deeply forked. Roots with well-developed
secondary wood. The sporangia are known in Etapteris Lacattei, which is probably a
Zygopteris, as the genus is here defined.
