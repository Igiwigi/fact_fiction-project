The frequency sub-bands that yielded the stronger correlations between time-varying degree
and band-limited power are related to each signal’s characteristic and suggest that fluctuations
in these bands have a clearer modulatory effect. For PETCO2 modulations in very low-frequency
power (0-0.08 Hz in functional space and 0-0.02 in MNI space) were found to have the clearer
effect, which is consistent with the previously described spectral characteristics of PETCO2
fluctuations [19,32]. For HR, a wider frequency band was identified (0-0.25 Hz) reflecting the
fact that HR has a richer spectral content than PETCO}. Additionally, the identified frequency
band contains the low-frequency (LF—around 0.1 Hz) spectral peak and possibly also the high-
frequency (HF—around 0.2 Hz) spectral peak of the HR signal. While, often, these two spectral
peaks are assumed to correspond to cardiac sympathetic and cardiac parasympathetic neural
activity, respectively, the relative contributions of each mechanism still remain the subject of
controversy and investigation.
