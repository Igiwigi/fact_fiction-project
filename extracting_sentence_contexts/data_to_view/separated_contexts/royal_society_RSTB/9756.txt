After thereby leading to erroneous conclusions about the effects of
all, if LTP were a ‘memory’ mechanism, how could females stress on learning. For example, exposure to laboratory stressors
be left without it (or even less of it)? More astounding to me such as swim stress or tail stimulation often suppresses motor
was the fact that virtually no scientists were testing females activity or motivation to forage for and consume food; therefore,
in their laboratory experiments. Indeed, the only scientists stress can induce deficits in performance simply as a matter of
that I could find who were currently using females in their change in motor activity and motivation. These effects may
