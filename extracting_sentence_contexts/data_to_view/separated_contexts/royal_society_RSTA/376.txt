many regions of the world for the CPDN ensemble compared with the CMIP3
ensemble, most likely owing to the fact that the CPDN ensemble is based only
on one GCM, albeit with a wide range of physics parameter values. We also explored the relative importance of changes in precipitation and
evaporation on MAR, although completely disentangling the two effects is
difficult without additional experiments. In our simulations, changes in potential
evaporation (PE) are a function of temperature change only, as we assume other
variables are unchanged in the future.
