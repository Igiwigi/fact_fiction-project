vomer is a derivative of the reptilian parasphenoid, and that the reptilian “pre-
vomers”’ are represented in the mammal only by the palatine processes of the pre-
maxillae. But during the last few years doubts have been expressed about the validity
of some of the evidence used, and it has been claimed that there is now good reason
to return to the original homology.

Whether the mammalian vomer evolved from the parasphenoid or from the
““prevomers” is not, in itself; a very important matter. But the current parasphenoid-
vomer hypothesis is founded mostly on embryology, while the doubts of its validity
have arisen from a consideration of recent palaeontological evidence, and the
importance of the problem lies in the necessity of finding an explanation which
satisfies both lines of evidence. To do this it has been necessary to re-examine both
the facts and the lines of reasoning. The value of such an analysis lies in its promise
to expose unreliable evidence and misleading methods.

In the first section of the following account the writers have attempted to give a
concise summary of the available evidence on the problem, and the interpretations

that in this section no importance is attached to evidence about which there is any
