Using the
best-fit line from figure 5a, we converted the lengths for each
data point in Craft et al. into an equivalent train size N, and
then re-plotted the occupancy data in figure 5b. As shown in figure 5b, the actual measurements of Pemptyr
as reported by Craft ef al. [14], are well fit by a straight line as
predicted from equation (3.2). This result suggests that in fact
tubulin binding to IFT particles may not be length-dependent,
and that the reported length dependence of tubulin loading
onto trains may simply be a result of the decreasing number
of particles per train in longer flagella. In order to definitively
say whether tubulin loading is, or is not, length-dependent, it
will be necessary to quantify the amount of tubulin per IFT
particle. This has been done with non-tubulin cargo [11] but
is more challenging for tubulin because the signal is less
intense.
