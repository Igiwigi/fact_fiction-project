Figure 6. (a—f) Jacket: tower top deflection and maxima acceleration profiles in x- and y-directions for fixed and flexible FMs.

Figures 5c and 6c show the maxima accelerations along the support structures, in x- and
y-directions. The acceleration profile in the x-direction shows that combined wind—wave—
earthquake loadings activate first and second FA support structure modes, in both Tripod and
Jacket, in all three load cases under investigation. The same observation can be made based
on the acceleration profile in the y-direction. The activation of the second FA and SS support
structure modes is confirmed by the fact that the acceleration profiles exhibit significant values
at approximately 2/3 of the support structure height, and this result is consistent with analogous
results for land-based HAWTs under earthquake loading [11].

(b) Response for flexible foundation model

Figures 5d-f and 6d-f show the tower top deflection and maxima accelerations along the support
structures, in x- and y-directions, for flexible FM. Results appear in agreement with the
corresponding ones for fixed FM. That is, the tower top deflection is significantly affected by the
earthquake strike, with a considerable increase with respect to the operational deflection in load
case LC1, a deviation from the operational deflection and subsequent transient in load case LC2,
an increase with respect to the parked deflection in load case LC3, with no notable differences
