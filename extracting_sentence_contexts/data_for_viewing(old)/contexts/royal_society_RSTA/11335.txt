Thus, any algebraic curve can be uniformised by means of groups of substitutions
formed from self-inverse substitutions.

It will be seen that a great similarity exists between the place occupied by self-
inverse substitutions, in the theory of groups of projective substitutions, and the

place oceupied by branch-points at which only two branches interchange, in the
theory of Riemann surfaces; the usefulness of the method of self-inverse substi-
tutions depends on the fact that algebraic forms can be represented on Riemann
surfaces with only simple branch-points.

Algebraic functions are not, however, the only ones which can be uniformised.
Porncar&* has proved a general existence-theorem that, if 4, %,... U%,, ave any
multiform analytical functions of a variable z,a variable ¢ always exists, such that
Z, Uy, Us,. ++ U,, are uniform functions of t. The existence-theorem, however, does
not connect ¢ analytically with the other variables. If w,, %%,... Up, are transcen-
dental functions of z, their multiformity will not in general be capable of being
expressed by simple branch-points, and so the groups generated by self-inverse
substitutions cannot be used.
