and difference, which are brought out by an examination of the process of menstruation
in these two species of monkeys, and to point out the fact that the results arrived at
by the study of M. rhesus, entirely contirm the results which my examination of
S. entellus led me to publish, I have purposely avoided all unnecessary repetition, and
have been obliged, in consequence, to assume some knowledge of the details given in
Part I. of this paper (No. 8).

The advisability for this course has seemed to be the more pronounced since the
results which I have arrived at differ, in various important particulars, from the
accounts of menstruation which have been generally accepted, and a confirmation of
the former has therefore some increased interest and importance.

With regard to the body of the uterus, I have only here to record the fact that the

mucosa is somewhat thicker than it is in S. entellus, and that the protoplasmic
network of the stroma is more granular and is denser, and the glands more numerous
and more branched than are these structures in the latter animal.

In M. rhesus as in S. entellus, there is an absence of any connective tissue frame-
work in the stroma ; we have, in fact, here, an essentially primitive tissue capable of
extensive and rapid growth, and of transformation into other and more specialised
tissues. The uterine and glandular epithelium, the glands devoid of a definite sheath,
