Identify conflicts of interest, but do not necessarily use them as grounds
to exclude individuals. And, above all, do all this openly. In many practical
circumstances it is most important, yet most difficult, to separate the scientific
facts and uncertainties—which must serve as a constraining background—from
policy choices. In addition, one should aim to assess the magnitude of risks,
whenever possible, and to manage them proportionately. When real or perceived
uncertainties remain, give people choices whenever possible (e.g. label GM food).
