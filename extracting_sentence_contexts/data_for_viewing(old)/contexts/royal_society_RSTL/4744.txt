336 LIEUT.-COLONEL SYKES'S DISCUSSION OF METEOROLOGICAL

meter, and the greatest daily and monthly range, occur in the same month at Doda-
betta, namely, January 1848. The lowest temperature in the year was 38*5, the
highest 672, and the annual range 28*5. The greatest monthly range was 243,

Aqueous Vapour.

Preliminary to the discussion of the question of aqueous yapour, a few words are
necessary on the caution requisite in generalizing on a limited number of facts, or
on observations not extending over lengthened periods of time. The hourly obserya-
tions of the wet bulb at Madras and Bombay, for 1843 and 1844, are apparently
trustworthy and satisfactory, supposing the wet bulb theorem to be correct. Those
at Calcutta were taken only twice daily, at 9% 40” a.m. and 4 Þ.M., and how far obser-
vations, taken twice only during the daytime, can be relied upon for the expression
of normal conditions, will best be shown by the following comparison of obseryations
of the wet bulb at Dodabetta at 8640 feet above the sea-level. The regular meteoro-
logical observations were recorded twice a day only, at 9" 40” a.m. and 3» 40m p..,
but on one day in each month independent observations were taken for twenty-four
consecutive hours. In a table I have compared the means of the 9* 40® a.m. and
31 40" p.m, observations with the means of the twenty-four consecutive hours for the
same day. The discrepancies are considerable, and too numerous to admit of the
