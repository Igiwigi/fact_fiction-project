The continuity of magnetic induction demands that this field is to a large
extent localized (see p. 89 supra). Now reverting to diamagnetic substances we are led, in the light of Rrrz’s
theory, to identify the local molecular field (10’ gauss) in their case as due to
the existence of molecular magnets, so arranged that for any particular molecule
the moment is zero. It seems that we could readily account on such a view for
the fact that the chemical combination of two diamagnetic substances can give
rise to a paramagnetic substance possessing magnetons. This is the case for
instance with the union of copper (diamagnetic) and sulphuric acid (diamagnetic)
resulting in the formation of cupric sulphate (which is paramagnetic and contains
10 magnetons to the molecule). The forces which come into play during the
chemical combination we may regard as upsetting the magnetic equilibrium of each
component.
