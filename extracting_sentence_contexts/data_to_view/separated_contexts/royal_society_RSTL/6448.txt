In one word, the proof against the theory of the direct action of
earth-currents in causing disturbances may be summed up by saying that, while the
magnetic disturbances of September 1859 and August 1860 were of opposite character,
the corresponding earth-currents, as determined by these three telegraphic lines, were of
the same character. 6. At first view it would almost appear as if this fact, which seems conclusive against
earth-currents (at least those earth-currents observed in this country) being the direct
and main cause of disturbances, were equally conclusive against their being induced
currents, since the effect of such upon the telegraph needle might be supposed opposite
in character to that which would be produced by such currents as would directly cause

magnetic disturbances, the two effects being antithetically and therefore definitely related
to each other. MDOCCLXIL, 4g

in passing over the surface of our globe.
