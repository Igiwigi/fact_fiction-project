For example, in the Euplotid nuclear code, there are two amino acids (Ile, Cys) that are
represented by three codons each (table 1). In the same way, in the non-power model, numbers 7
and 16 have degeneracy 3 since they are represented by three binary strings each (in green).

We have seen that the degeneration of both the Euplotid nuclear and of the mitochondrial
genetic code admit a non-power representation. Is this a fortunate coincidence?

The degeneracy distributions that admit a non-power representation are extremely rare. In
order to see this, note that symmetry of the degeneracy table is a necessary condition for a
existence of a non-power representation. The ratio between the number of symmetric degeneracy
tables over the total number of possible tables gives a coarse assessment of this fact under the
assumption that every table occurs with the same probability.

Counting the number of degeneracy tables is analogous to what in physics is called the Bose—
Einstein statistics, that is, counting the ways one can distribute k indistinguishable balls into 1
labelled urns. In our 6-bit binary system, we have 64 strings/balls and 24 numbers/urns. Hence,

the total number of tables is
n+k—1)\_ (64+23\ _ 20
( k-1 )-( 23 ) =sa2 10 :

The number of symmetric tables is
