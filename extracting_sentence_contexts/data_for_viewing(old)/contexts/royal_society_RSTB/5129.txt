In other cases, though red corpuscles were present, they were relatively few and

were considerably outnumbered by leucocytes. In a transverse section through a vessel
of 0-2 mm. diameter, upon the margins of a large granular clot were not more than
eight red corpuscles, and around and within the clot some 17 leucocytes.

The presence of red blood within these vessels, though its quantity is remarkable, does
not necessarily imply that they are part of the true blood vascular system, for in fishes
the lymphatics normally contain a fluctuating number of red corpuscles. This fact
has been generally observed, and I can confirm it in the case of the lymphatics of Lophius,
although in this fish the proportion of red corpuscles“in the lymph seems never to be
high, though sufficient sometimes to give to the contents of the larger lymphatic trunks
a pinkish hue. In a smear made from the contents of the main abdominal lymphatic
trunk the proportion of red to white corpuscles was about 3 to 16.

Discussion.

It seemed probable that Lophius was not the only fish in which these vessels occur.
On « priori grounds it would be unlikely that a system of vessels so extensive and well
defined should be restricted to one particular species of fish, and it was therefore with
some satisfaction that I observed in some preliminary investigations that I have made
