(b) Observable perspective :8

A different approach to contextuality and contextuality tests has been developed starting from the
perspective OP. In contrast to EP, joint measurements and, in particular, sequential measurements
are considered. In the OP, the ‘physical properties’ are associated with measurements instead of
single effects, whereas ‘contexts’ are identified with joint measurements of them.

This approach includes, in particular, the Bell scenario [1], in which this structure is clear. In
fact, in a Bell test, the goal is to measure correlations between different measurements performed
on two parts of an entangled system and located in two space-like separated regions.

The typical example of such correlations is given by the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt
(CHSH) expression with the corresponding classical bound, i.e. the CHSH inequality [25]

(A1B1) + (A1B2) + (A2Bi) — (A2B2) < 2, (3.5)

where A; is a measurement with +1 outcomes, denoted as a;, and similarly for B;, and one defines
(AjBj) = aba] a;bjProb(aj, bj).

In each round of the experiment, a measurement on Alice’s system, say Aj, and a measurement
on Bob’s system, say Bj, are performed (figure 2a). Connecting the Bell scenario with the OP
