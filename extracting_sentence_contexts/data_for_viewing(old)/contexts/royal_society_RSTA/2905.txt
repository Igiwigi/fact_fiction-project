statutes, treaties and doctrinal treatises or to predict the outcome of future case law. ALI is entirely [8

dependent on the choice of training data (legal text), its labelling and curation (marking what is .

deemed relevant for the output, i.e. a decision about whether or not a legal norm was violated),

the hypothesis space that was developed (a set of mathematical functions that aims to connect

input data with output data), and the performance metric chosen (percentage of output that is

correct according to legal experts) [9]. ALI is not deterministic in the sense that IFTTT is. In point

of fact, it contains a new type of discretion, situated in the design choices made when training

the algorithms. These choices have many implications as to the reliability, the comprehensibility

and the contestability of the output, but, as they are usually made by technology developers

and policy makers, they are largely invisible to those who may be subject to decisions based on

ALI. Each and every design decision has trade-offs, for instance between speed and accuracy,

between generalizability and correctness or between accuracy and interpretability. There is an

unwarranted aura of objectivity around the output of ML, notably concerning complex ML
