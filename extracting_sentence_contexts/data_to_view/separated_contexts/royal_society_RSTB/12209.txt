Maximum shell length in
modern oysters rarely exceeds 120mm, while Pleistocene
oysters can reach lengths in excess of 250 mm. This difference
is size does not result from faster growth rates in Pleistocene
oysters. In fact, growth rates in modern oysters (15.72 mm

are defined from population samples, then whole population yr) are twice as fast as Pleistocene oysters (7.82 mm yr)
estimates of filtration per unit area can be generated and scaled (when modelled linearly for oysters less than or equal to 5
appropriately to reef coverage in estuarine or coastal systems years of age). Instead, this pattern results from the fact that
(SOM Filtration Calculation). Pleistocene oysters lived an average of 5 years longer

Cycling of carbon was determined using the model of carbon than modern oysters, which is more than double (2.75x) the
flux developed by Fodrie et al. [48].
