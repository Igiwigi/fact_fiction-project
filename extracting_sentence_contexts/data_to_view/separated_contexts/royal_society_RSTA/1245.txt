The third column : S
shows the density perturbation of a slow kink body mode in a cylindrical magnetic flux tube and the dashed circle shows the : 3

boundary of the tube. In the first and the second columns, the solid black line shows the umbra/penumbra boundary as shown
in figure 1b and the dashed circle is to compare the observations with the flux tube in the third column. The images shown in
the two rows are chosen to be in anti-phase, hence, they represent different time snapshots. (Online version in colour.)

could simply be due to the fact that the observed oscillations are being continually forced and are
not free. The next POD mode that can be interpreted as a physical MHD wave mode is the 13th mode
which has the azimuthal asymmetry of a kink mode as shown in the first column of figure 3, with
a peak at 6 mHz as shown in figure 4b. The DMD mode with frequency of 6 mHz is shown in the
second column in figure 3.
