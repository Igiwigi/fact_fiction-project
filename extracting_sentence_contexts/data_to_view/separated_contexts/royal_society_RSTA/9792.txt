A. FOWLER ON THE SPECTRUM OF MAGNESIUM HYDRIDE.

intensity in the region about 4780, and can be followed to the violet head at 4371. The spectrum, in fact, shows an almost unbroken succession of lines at very short
intervals throughout the entire visible spectrum, but the lines are mostly faint, except
in the definite flutings to which reference has been made. The ultra-violet spectrum, of which no measurements have yet been undertaken,
also exhibits a great number of lines distributed throughout its whole extent. There
is a well-marked fluting, very similar to the one in the green, with its head about
2430, and fading off on the more refrangible side.
