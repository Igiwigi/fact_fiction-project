* Synonymous with P. neriifolius, Don. t+ Ihave observed the same feature in one other (unidentified) species of Podocarpus (§ Eupodocarpus),
and consider it very probable that it occurs in several other species. The fact that StiLEs does not
figure or describe the phenomenon in P. macrophyllus, a species closely allied to P. bracteata, may be due to
his sections not having passed through the region to which this condition appears to be limited. AFFINITIES OF ACMOPYLE PANCHERI, PILGER. 285

The conception of a cup-like vascular system pendent from the chalaza oceurred to
Favre (1865, p. 381) as early as 1865 from his study of Podocarpus chinensis, but,
so far as I am aware, no one has followed up his suggestive idea.
