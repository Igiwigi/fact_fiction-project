The effect produced by the variation of one condition only, that of motion, is most
remarkable, the result to all appearances paradoxical. For all investigations on



CHANGE BETWEEN NITRIC ACID AND CERTAIN METALS. 301

chemical change have taught us that its amount is increased by the removal of the
products of change from the immediate environment of the reacting substances. Herein an example of the reverse is presénted: The explanation lies in the fact that
hy this chemical change the solvent is produced of one of the substances entering into
the change, and this, remaining within the sphere of action, increases the amount of
| the chemical change, and is itself simultaneously increased. In another experiment a
globule of mercury, 7°5885 grms. in weight, was introduced into 750 c.c. of nitric
| acid (specific gravity 1°2106, concentration = 34°12 per cent.), heated to 26°; at the
end of one hour the globule weighed 7°5745 grms.; there was thus a loss of ‘014
+ grm., equal to "18 per cent. Into the same acid, heated to the same temperature, a
R globule, of weight 6°535 grms., was introduced, while the acid and mercury were
Q kept at rest.
