The fact that the resolution in the synXPC


system was approximately twice that of the CAXPCi system would suggest that this could be
within reach, although more detailed analysis (e.g. quantitative comparison between the signal-
to-noise ratios obtained with the two systems) and tests are still required before firm conclusions
can be drawn. (ii) In the longer term, further improvement in the CAXPCi system may lead to
a new generation of CAXPCi micro-CT scanners, which could be used for in vivo longitudinal
pre-clinical imaging of AC at resolutions impossible to achieve by current MRI technology. Notably, given the proven difficulties with contrast-enhanced micro-CT imaging of the mouse
AC in vivo, X-ray phase-contrast micro-CT seems to provide the most valuable potential solution
to bring the mouse model of OA to the next level in terms of throughput and translational
applications. Some degree of promise in this sense is given by the fact that our preliminary studies
on rat cartilage with the laboratory-based system were conducted at acceptable dose levels [21];
however, the main challenge will consist in being able to maintain comparable dose levels in the
three-dimensional implementation of a system with at least twice the resolution. Funding statement. This work was funded by the EPSRC (grants EP/G004250/1 and EP/1021884/1) and the
