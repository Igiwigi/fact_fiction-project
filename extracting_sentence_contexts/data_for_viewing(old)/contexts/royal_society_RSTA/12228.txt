work necessary to compress the following layer——that is to say, the layer loses on this
score just as much heat as it gained by its own compression. ‘The whole proceeds, as
far as the elevation of temperature is concerned, precisely as if we had operated under
constant pressure.” On the facts of the case there is no dispute. The gas is exploded
in a closed vessel. Each layer is compressed before being fired; after firing it
compresses the layer beyond it. Now, as regards this preliminary compression, each
layer, in turn, expends the same energy as was previously communicated to it, and,
therefore, it does no work of its own. But a gas heated under conditions where it
syloes no work is raised to the same temperature as it would be had its volume
Semained constant. M. Berruetor admits that it would appear at first sight as if
She gases were heated at constant volume; he adds that the concordance of the
@alculated with the observed numbers supports his explanation of the phenomena.
& Again, the fact that each layer is fired by compression involves the preliminary.
heating of that layer, and this heating must be added to the heat developed by its
Surning. The temperature of the burning layer must, therefore, be greater than
#hat obtained by dividing the heat developed in the chemical change by the specific
fReat of the products of combustion.
2 When a sound-wave alone is transmitted through a gas its velocity shows that
"wach layer of gas forming the wave-front is heated by compression, and there is no
geason why this should not happen when the compression is accompanied by a
xhemical change.
To what extent is each layer heated before combustion? MM. Mantarp and
Sir Cuatetrer* state that the explosion-wave will be propagated when each layer
Bs brought by compression to its own temperature of inflammation, For hydrogen
"gind oxygen, they find this temperature to be about 550° C., and calculate that a
