Sranish. Quere, whether the character of the five-rayed pencil (centre at origin), in which a, A; b, B; c, C;

Sd, D; e, E mark points, may not serve to distinguish between the case of four real and four imaginary roots, ]

= (© When J=0 and K=0, but not L=0, it is obvious that p: @:7:; 1:4: 8, i being any imaginary cube root of
unity, and the reduced form is uw + +45, with the relation u+v+w=0.

JT and K being zero, D will be 80 too, and accordingly the equation uw*+w*+ Pu*=0 will have two equal
roots, Tt will easily be found that these equal roots correspond to the system of ratios u=1, v=i?, w=.
In fact, if we write u=1 +6, v=®+1g, w=i+0#%, the equation becomes uw+1*+1%u*=g*(30p+3g*)=0.

Hence, understanding by e either of the two prime sixth roots of unity, the complete system of ratios of uw, v, w
may be expressed as follows ;—

u=1 v=s? ws
u=1 v=i? was
u=1— 10 v=i?— 4/10 w=i—F 10

u=1+ 10s v=e\— 4/10 w=e*+ 106
w=zl+ 106 v=e'+ 4/108 w=ze— 4/10.
Thus, when J=0 and-K=0, u, v, w (with the relation u4+v+w=0) may firzt be”found, in terms of w, y, by
