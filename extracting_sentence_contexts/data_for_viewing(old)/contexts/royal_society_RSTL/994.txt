inner membrane of the human stomach : and the surface of
the plice is in many respects different.

From the facts and observations which have been stated, it

undergoes different changes preparatory to its being con--
verted into chyle, and this last process is effected by a some-

produces it, has in all of them an evident similarity of
structure.

The above facts appear to throw some light on the diges-
