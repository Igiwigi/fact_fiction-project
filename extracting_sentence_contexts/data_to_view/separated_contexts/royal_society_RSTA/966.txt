More precisely, can
one tell from asymptotics of joint eigenvalues or eigenfunctions of (P},..., Py) that the principal
symbols are almost everywhere independent? A great achievement of microlocal analysis of pseudo-differential operators is the formulation
of complete Bohr-Sommerfeld rules to any order. Given a quantum integrable system, these rules
are, in fact, some kind of integrality conditions (or cohomological conditions), depending on a
parameter E € R", that are satisfied if and only if E is a joint eigenvalue of the system, modulo an
arbitrarily small error of size O(h™). Historically (both in physics and mathematics), these rules have been written for regular
Lagrangian tori, ie. E should stay in a small ball of regular values of the classical moment map.
