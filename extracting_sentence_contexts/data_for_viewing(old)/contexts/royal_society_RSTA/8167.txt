The method in which the dust is carried to the nodes has been described in Section 3.
This can be explained in terms of the general node-to-antinode circulation described
in the paper on “ Circulations,” and the vortex formation round an obstacle. If
conditions are such that the general circulation is very strong, the flow near the walls
will carry particles along with it, the particles most easily entrained being the extreme
particles of each ridge, since at the middle of the ridge, where it is several particles
deep, the inter-ridge vortex motion will be more vigorous, as can not only be deduced
from the fact that vortex motion is more easily initiated by a big obstacle (see “ Circula-
tions ”), but can also be directly confirmed by observation of the motion of the minute
particles which are always to be found mixed with the larger cork particles.

Again, the velocity of the general circulation is greater close to the wall than it is
at some little distance from it,* so that at the extremities of the ridges, where the flow
is undisturbed, the motion due to the general circulation is largest. The ridges near
the antinode are therefore robbed of their particles from the edge, and gradually
destroyed, while fresh ridges are built up near the node, and ultimately carried towards it,
A general confirmation of this view is given by the fact that the more dust there is in the
tube, the more stable are the ridges, and the less the general motion towards the nodes.
