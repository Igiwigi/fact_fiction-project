In the junction between rings A and B the arrangement may be either cis or trans,
and the chemical evidence shows it to be trans in the cholestane allo-cholanic acid

series, passing to cis in the coprostane-cholanic acid series. Compounds of both groups
have been examined crystallographically, but the differences between them do not at
this stage appear to be diagnostic. It is perhaps interesting, however, that coprostene
(VIII) and coprostane (IX) are crystallographically closely related—a fact which
may have some stereochemical significance. Cholestene (X) and cholestane (XI), on
the other hand, both crystallize in rather irregular structures. HO HO
