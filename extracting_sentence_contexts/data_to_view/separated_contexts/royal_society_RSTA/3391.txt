Hence with increasing distance from the origin the disturbance tends to the
limiting form represented by (101). Before leaving this part of the subject, it is to be remarked that the peculiar
protracted character of the minor tremor which we have found to precede and follow
the main shock is to some extent special to the two-dimensional form of the question. It is connected with the fact, dwelt upon by the author in a recent paper,* that even
in an unlimited medium a solitary cylindrical wave, whether of the irrotational or
equivoluminal kind, is not sharply defined in the rear, as it is in front, but is prolonged
in the form of a “tail.” In the three-dimensional problems, to which we are about
to proceed, this cause operates in another way. The internal waves are now
spherical instead of cylindrical, and so far there is no reason to expect a protraction
of a disturbance which in its origin was of finite duration.
