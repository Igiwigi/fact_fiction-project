Xenopus on the effects on both Nodal laterality and organ the case in many scenarios. It would also explain the appar-
situs. The level of incorrect Nodal expression in untreated ent lack of conservation in mechanisms for left-right
embryos, while low, was higher than the level of abnormal patterning across closely related vertebrates, as different
organ situs ([86], table 2).
