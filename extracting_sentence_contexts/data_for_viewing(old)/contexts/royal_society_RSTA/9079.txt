disturbance in one case than in the other—the melting-points of the two elements
are not very different—it may be, however, that the volatilisation points differ.
Ihave pursued this matter in connection with the examination of a large number of
meteoric irons (siderites) that will form the subject of a further communication.*

Although these experiments only make it possible to form an approximate
estimate of the amount of chromium present in these aerolites it would seem to lie
between 0°6 per cent. and 0°1 per cent.

In the previous experiments the proportion of nickel which was kept the same in
all mixtures was evidently in considerable excess of that contained in any of the

* Without anticipating this communication on siderites, I desire to point out the remarkable fact that
although the chromium lines appear, sometimes very strongly, in all my aerolite spectra they do not
appear in any of the siderites I have so far examined—except in one instance, that of “ Zacatecas.”
Although of course the nickel lines are always visible—from the spectroscopic examination of a number
of specimens of iron, to which I had added decreasing amounts of chromium, I found that the dominant
lines of chromium were quite visible even when the amount present was no more than 0-0175 per cent:
This is due to the fact that chromium is absent from the nickel-irons but almost universally present in
the aerolites in the form of chromite. In Aubres, &c., there is probably more chromite than nickel-iron.

In the magma which produced meteorites all the Cr was converted into oxide or sulphide, giving rise to
the mineral chromite or daubreelite and leaving no Cr for the nickel-iron.
