embryos of the Dorsibranchiata and Tubicole come forth in a state of far less advance
ment, and only acquire their perfect form by such a series of changes as deserves the
designation of a metamorphosis.”

It remains to be pointed out, as before alluded to, that although the quinary arrange
ment of organs and parts is 80 prevalent amongst the Echinoderms, it is far from being
invariable ; for, as remarked by Professxor ForBrs, © monstrous starfishes and urchins
often appear quadrate and have their parts fourfold, assuming the reigning number of
the Actinodermata,” or Polypes. In the Nematoids, too, we meet with a quadrate mixed
with a ternate type of formation. The lateral and median lines radiate crucially from
the mouth and extend along the body, alternating with four great longitudinal muscles;
but whilst we have here a radiate arrangement, which may also be considered bilateral,
this approach to a bilateral symmetry is disturbed by the fact that the czxophageal canal
in the Nematoids is almost invariably triquetrous, that the number of teeth in the phas
ryngeal cavity of the free Nematoids, when s8uch exist, is generally three, and that the
8ame number applies to the cephalic lobes of the Ascarides, and a multiple of it to thoss
of the Spiroptere. Ag another notable instance of deviation from a bilateral symmetry,
may be cited the remarkably unsymmetrical distribution of the peculiar transverse pairs
of yessels existing in some members of the genus AscarisF.

By reason of these various resemblances, though more especially on account of the
remarkable identity in the structure and arrangement of their nervous systems, I think
it most in accordance with the nature of ascertained facts to look upon the Nematoids
as close allies of the Echinodermata—more closely allied to them, in fact, than to the
