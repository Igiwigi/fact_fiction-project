We investigate the HIV infection dynamics with therapy using microscopic
simulations. Non-uniform cellular automata (CA) are employed to simulate drug

reatment of HIV infection, where each computational domain contains different
CA rules, in contrast to normal uniform CA models.

We have defined CD4+ T-cells as the main entities. Each cell is assigned
healthy /infected or dead flag depending on the interactions with its neighbours

for more details see Sloot et al. 2002).

Different drug therapies can be modelled by differences in a response
distribution function over time. The function is chosen to model the fact that
he drug therapy will not immediately influence all of the infected cells, but
rather it will affect part of them at each time step. At the same time, the function
accounts for the concept of drug-resistant virus strains emerging.

The simulation result for treatment naive individual dynamics is shown in
figure 5. The result represents qualitatively the HIV infection dynamics. The
first phase indicates the fast proliferation of the original HIV strains before
he actual immune system response (acute phase). This phase ends when specific
immune response occurs for these strains. The next phase, the chronic phase
hat takes years, is the phase where the viral load increases slowly and CD4
counts decrease slowly. When CD4+ T-cell counts drop to a certain level
normal 200-500 counts ml~'), the drug therapy is started. In this phase, virus
