Till tables have been
calculated for the skew curves, such processes are all that are available ; but they
are quite sufficient, for we do not want great exactness in the determination of ?. We merely desire to know whether the observations are with reasonable probability
the result of a random sampling from the proposed theoretical distribution, Now
let us examine the results. We see that for (2), (83-2), and (2-1) the normal curve is
for practical purposes “ impossible.” As a matter of fact, we might have gone to the
tenth figure without the probability being sensible in these cases. Further, (1) is
highly improbable, the odds being about 1666 to 1 against its occurrence as a
random sample. In the case of (1-3) the odds are 22 to 1 against a deviation as
bad or worse than this, so that this is an improbable result.
