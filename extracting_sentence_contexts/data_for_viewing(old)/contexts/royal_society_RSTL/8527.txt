transformation of cos am u=cos am v. If, therefore, we perform the process of $11 in
reverse order (#. e. starting with the trigonometrical side of the identity to be proved,
sum the rows instead of transforming them) we obtain (42) at once.

It appears at first sight as if ScHELLBACH's formula

(45)

gave rise to another formula for the cosine amplitude, by writing a for > and changing
the modulus from & to &' ; but this, in fact, merely gives an expression already obtained ;
for the right-hand side of (45), on writing a for & and &”* for q, becomes

Formulz such as (45) are the nearest approach I have met with to those numbered
(10) to (17) and the other expressions at the end of < 5; but (besides that an imaginary
