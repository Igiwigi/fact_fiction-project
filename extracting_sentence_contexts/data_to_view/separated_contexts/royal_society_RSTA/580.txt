Empirical studies show that the behaviour of commodities is modelled by the complex branch,
and hence our choice of domain and additional constraints are as discussed above. In fact, we shall
later see that our model fits the market data quite well. Note that the market correlation function additionally exhibits oscillations that do not vanish
even for large t — t’, for which the model correlation function has decayed to zero. The value for
t — t' for which the model correlation function G(t — f’) is zero indicates the range for which the
model is applicable, and which is an important consideration in fitting market data.
