At its upper extremity this line, widening into a groove,
contains the remains of the bent edge of the anterior boundary of the nostril, which can
be traced downwards for some distance along a kind of canal, and which in a foetus 65
retains its connexion with the soft structures lying beneath the nasal process, reaching
up towards the nasal bone,

Lastly, in a foetus 9 inches long, the boundary of the intermaxilla is still distinctly
marked on the under surface of the palate, extending outwards to the posterior half of
the outer wall of the lateral incisor, which it forms as far as the margin of the foramen
for the nerve, thence it extends, as a fissure occupied by the nerve for the middle incisor,
and crossing the septum between the incisors is lost in the plates of bone which have
Joined the incisor process. The preceding observations account for the absence of all trace of the human inter-
maxillary bone on the facial aspect of the upper jaw in the adult, whilst the permanent
fissure through the palate and on the inner side of the nasal process are equally explained. The bone, in fact, is shut, off from the face by the nasal and incisor processes of the supe-
rior maxilla. Distinetly outlined (Plate XIV. fig. 6)
