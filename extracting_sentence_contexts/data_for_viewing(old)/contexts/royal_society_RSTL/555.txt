4- That those animals, in which the nerves of the electrical
organs are intersected, lose the power of communicating the
shock, but appear more vivacious, and live longer than those
'n which this change has not been produced, and in which

is power is exerted. Is the loss of the power of commu-

power over the organ? Does this fact bear any analogy to
the effects produced by castration in animals ?

5. That the possession of one organ only is sufficient to
produce the shock.

6. That the perfect state of all the nerves of the electrical
organs, is not necessary to produce the shock.

And, 7. From the whole it may be concluded, that a more
intimate relation exists between the nervous system and-elec-
trical organs of the torpedo, both as to structure and func-
tions, than between the same and any organs of any animal
