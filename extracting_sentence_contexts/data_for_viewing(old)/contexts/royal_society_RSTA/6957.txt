condition, the maximum error of the first approximation was 58 units, but the first correc-
tion gave a maximum error of only one unit. Quicker convergence is alsosecured by arranging
the mesh so that the line y = 1 lies half-way between two mesh lines, and using equation
(A. 12) for the derivative condition. In this case the first and second approximations had
errors of up to 44 and 1 units respectively.

354 L. FOX ON THE NUMERICAL SOLUTION

It may be remarked that the maximum error of the first approximation was less in the
first method than in the second, in spite of the fact that a more accurate derivative formula
was used in the latter. The reason lies in the fact that in this example neglected terms in the
differential equation are of opposite sign to those in the boundary condition, and the two
sources of error cancel each other to some extent. As pointed out in previous papers, this is
not a circumstance to be relied on, and, indeed, the corrections are not negligible even at
the smaller interval h = 0-1.
