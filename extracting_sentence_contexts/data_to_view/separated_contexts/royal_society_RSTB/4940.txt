Soon a small additional plate is
laid down in the gap, and as this space increases in size more and more small plates
are laid down in it. Text-fig. 19, Â¢, shows two of these, but the sur-anal plate is still
contiguous with genital 3. Meanwhile the sur-anal plate is increasing in size (fig. 19,
a-c, shows three stages in the development of this plate), and owing to the fact that
the calcite is undergoing rapid resorption, the rim of the plate which is in contact with
genitals 2, 1,5, becomes thin and transparent (fig. 19, d and a). Then the margin itself
becomes jagged and the plate gradually assumes approximately the shape found in
the adult (fig. 19, c). It retains its connection with genital 3 for a long time, but as
more plates are laid down in the periproct it is ultimately separated completely from
the genitalring.
