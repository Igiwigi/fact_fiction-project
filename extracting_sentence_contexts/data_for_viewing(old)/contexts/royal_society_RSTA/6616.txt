This Theme Issue on X-ray topography and crystal characterization is dedicated to
Professor Andrew Lang on the occasion of his seventy-fifth birthday. Since his inven-
ion of high-resolution X-ray topography in 1959, a very wide range of applications
has been found. At that time, relatively few crystals were available of sufficiently
high perfection to benefit from the technique. Since then, the growth of the elec-
ronics industry and the application of Lang topography itself to problems of crystal
growth have meant that studies of materials as diverse as silicon, diamond, copper,
iron, sapphire, ferroelectrics, explosives and delicate organic crystals have proven
tuitful. The development of synchrotron radiation topography in the late 1970s led
o a resurgence of interest and the development of dedicated beamlines for X-ray
imaging at the major synchrotron radiation laboratories. Andrew himself has moved
with these developments and even in retirement remains an active user of the Dares-
ury SRS. This volume also attests to the fact that many of those originally inspired
o work in X-ray topography have branched into other fields of X-ray science, from
omographic crack imaging to the application of genetic algorithms to the inverse
roblem of X-ray scattering.

For this issue we invited former students, postdoctoral visitors, colleagues and
summer school associates of Andrew to submit papers relevant to the Theme. Some,
of course, for various reasons, had to decline the invitation, but we were delighted by

he response and enthusiasm of all to the idea of the Theme Issue. We are grateful
o the Editor of Philosophical Transactions, Professor Michael Thompson, for his
ready agreement to include this Theme. It is particularly appropriate that this trib-
ute should be published by the Royal Society, which recently awarded Andrew its
