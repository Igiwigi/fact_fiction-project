558 Sir H. Davy's Experiments on the

ALLEN and Peyys, seems till inclined to adopt this opinion,
though in admitting a much smaller quantity of oxygene than
he originally supposed in charcoal ; and he considers the dia-
mond as pure carbonaceous matter, containing, possibly, some
atoms of water of crystallisation.

I have long had a desire of making some new experiments
on the combustion of the diamond and other carbonaceous
substances, and this desire was increased by the new facts
ascertained with respect to iodine, which by uniting to hy-
drogene, affords an acid so analogous to muriatic acid, that it
was for some time confounded with that substance. My object
in these experiments, was to examine minutely whether any
peculiar matter was separated from the diamond during its
combustion, and to determine whether the gas, formed in this
process, was precisely the same in'its minute chemical nature,
as that formed in the combustion of common charcoal, | I
have lately been able to accomplish my wishes; I shall now
have the honour of communicating my results to the Royal
Society.
