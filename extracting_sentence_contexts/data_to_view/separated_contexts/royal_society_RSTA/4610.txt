Note that FALSE_BOTTOM, the
simulation that uses the same Bitz & Lipscomb [36] parametrization has a similar low sea ice
state bias. Comparing REF and NO_3EQTN, we see that the differences are smaller (AA ~ —5%,
AH ~ —20.cm, ATmix ~ +0.3°C and ASmix ~ 0 PSU), the impact is localized over the marginal ice
zone and happens almost exclusively in the summer season (June and July not shown). This is
consistent with the larger melt rate in this region in NO_3EQTN and reflects the fact the three-
equation boundary condition is most effective where there is a source of fresh melted water at
the IO interface, hence lowering the interfacial salinity, S9, and reducing the bottom heat flux (see
equations (2.4)-(2.6) in §2b). The impact of switching off the form drag parametrization of Tsamados et al. [40] in
NO_FORM_DRAG is spatially bi-modal; increasing the summer concentration (marginally), ice
thickness (AH ~ +1m) and ML salinity (ASmix ~ 1 PSU) in the heavily ridged regions north of
Greenland and the Canadian Archipelago, and decreasing the ice concentration (AA ~ —10%)
and ice thickness (AH ~ —25cm) while increasing the ML temperature (ATmix ~ +0.3°C) over
the Russian continental shelves. As discussed in §3a, these differences can be largely explained
by increased (reduced) interfacial heat fluxes due to the higher (lower) than average atmospheric
