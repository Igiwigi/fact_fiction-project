Such a situation can occur in patients or in healthy individ-
uals in various pathologic or experimental conditions such
blindsight, neglect, subliminal perception, attentional blink,
change blindness or attentional blindness for instance. How
would P-Cs theory categorize this non-reported stimulus: as
P-conscious or unconscious? If one would rely on the fact
that the individual ‘is in some way aware of having it’ to
label it as P-conscious, then we are back to the previous
issue we raised: P-conscious status would exclusively rely

on subjective report, and would, therefore, be included
within the content of A-Cs. Alternatively, it is easy to see
that no solid criterion enables us to tease apart these two
categories: P-conscious versus unconscious. In sharp contrast, reportability theory provides a clear
delineation of conscious representations (accessed) and can
be used in the framework of the global workspace (GW)
model to propose a precise and testable taxonomy of various
types of unconscious processing defined on their correspond-
ing psychological and neural mechanisms [5,6].

(c) From ‘pan-consciouscism’ of contents to ‘pan-
consciouscism’ of states

In addition to the risk of pan-consciouscism of content (defin-
ing the whole perceptual content as P-conscious), P-Cs theory
also paves the way to a pan-consciouscism of states.
