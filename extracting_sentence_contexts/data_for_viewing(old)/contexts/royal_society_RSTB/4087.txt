the contractions. In late larvee there may sometimes be made out a “skeleton” set
of fibres which resemble muscular fibres, but do not quite disappear when ‘the
contractions cease. This set of fibres was very definite in the late larvee of my
cultures of Porania, and could be seen to have a practically uniform arrangement in
different individuals. The fibres were too few in number to have any appreciable
power of effecting movement by themselves. Careful observation showed that they
underwent some shortening when the neighbouring muscular tissue was in contraction.
Their definiteness, the regularity of their arrangement, and the fact that one or more
fibrils from them passed to all the ciliated processes and to the different regions of the
ciliated tracts made it difficult to believe them abnormal or without meaning, and,
indeed, left little doubt that they are specialised for some purpose, probably for
conducting stimuli. In that case, whatever their origin, they may be called neuro-
muscular, and the fact of their existence in the larva may be comparable with, and
related to, the occurrence in the adult of the so-called entoneural nervous system.

While in the case of many important adult organs (hydroccele, axial sinus, axial organ, gonads,

pharyngeal ceelom), a left ancestral structure has persisted, we need not say the same of the adult nerve
ring. This ring may have arisen through gradual modification of the whole of a circumoral nerve
