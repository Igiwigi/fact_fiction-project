It is illuminating to inspect some of the reconstructed images in figure 13, which correspond to
the plots in figure 12. The second and third reconstructions for the structure phantom straddle
the sharp transition in the corresponding image RMSE curve, and it can be seen clearly in the
difference image that the result for Ny =60 is not recovered, while that for Ny =68 is much
closer to the test phantom. We point out, however, that the difference images are displayed in
a narrow 4% grey scale window and visually the Ny = 60 image appears the same as the structure
phantom. That the discrepancies between reconstruction and phantom are so small emphasizes
the challenge for the large-scale optimization algorithms; for actual application where images are
presented for visual inspection, such accurate solution to equation (1.1) would not be necessary.
The results for the texture phantom are also quite interesting in that we see the reconstructed
image is visually accurate for as few views as Ny = 80. That there is no sharp recovery transition
for the texture phantom is probably due to the fact that the object variations occur on two scales:
the jumps of the structure borders, and the splotches of the walnut meat texture. It also cannot be
ruled out that a sharper recovery transition will occur if the accuracy of the computed solutions
is improved even further.

(e) Conclusion on Study C

In this study, we have taken first steps towards phase-diagram analysis for prediction of critical
sampling levels for realistic CT systems. Both test phantom design and accurate large-scale
optimization are more difficult than for small-scale studies, and we have demonstrated how
phantom appearance as well as parameters and convergence of the algorithm can affect recovery
studies. For the simplest, and piecewise constant, structure walnut phantom, we found the critical
sampling level to be predicted very well by phase-diagram analysis. The situation for the texture
