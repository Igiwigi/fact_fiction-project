Interestingly, as will be discussed in ยง3f, there seems

to be also a correlation between the cone crack angle and v. The concomitant increase of the

E/H ratio results in radial/median cracks to grow on heating in a window glass (figure 14c-e). As a matter of fact, the soda-lime-silicate glass seems more damaged at 473K than at ambient

(figure 14d) [52]. Nevertheless, viscous flow takes over at higher temperatures, and especially

on approaching Tg which corresponds to a characteristic relaxation time constant of the order

of a minute, i.e. comparable to the time scale of an indentation experiment. In the present case

visible microcracks disappeared in the 723-753 K range (figure 14e,f).
