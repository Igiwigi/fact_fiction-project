these planes and the angles at which the first order spectra occur. The heights of the
vertical lines represent intensities, and their magnitudes are also indicated in figures
underneath, in arbitrary units. Their abscisse represent the sines of the angles of
reflection. The numerals placed above the lines on the right ef the diagram show
the percentages of the molecular weight lying in the various planes.

The structure of calcite has already been investigated by W. L. Braaa,* and fig. 15,
is reproduced from his paper. In its determination use was made, as in other cases,
of a knowledge of the crystal symmetries. The fact that the (111) planes contain

~ alternately calcium atoms only, and groups of CO; only was inferred from a
S comparison of the (111) spectra of the calcite series of crystals. In all cases there is
