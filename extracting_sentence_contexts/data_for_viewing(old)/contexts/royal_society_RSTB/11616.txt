both captive conditions and the field. For example, cases of
infants stillborn during veterinary intervention or where the
infant corpse is removed forcibly from the mother should be
excluded. Similarly, carrying duration is invalidated if portage
is interrupted artificially or by conspecific intervention.

We suggest a novel approach to analyses—direct com-
parison of influencing factors between infant deaths after
which mothers carry, and deaths after which mothers have
the opportunity to carry the corpse yet do not. Note that,
due to the infrequent observation of death events and thus
limited feasibility of establishing complete absence of carry-
ing, especially in the field, ‘no carry’ may in fact apply to
carrying for no more than a few hours. Effects of multiple
potential contributory factors, both nominal and interval
level, on the nominal dependent variable (carry/no carry),
could be analysed together using logistic regression.

4. Quantitative coding in case reports
(a) Behavioural responses

Case reports could contribute more substantially to this
field. Several researchers [3,21] have highlighted the need
for more detailed, objective, quantitative data on behaviour-
al responses to death. Behaviours directed by nonhuman
