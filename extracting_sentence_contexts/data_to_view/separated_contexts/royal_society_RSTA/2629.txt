What is also interesting from this approach
is that the ACCFyax and Ds profile comparison results obtained with fresh leaves against
negative moulds and fresh leaves against positive moulds consistently show deteriorated results
for positive moulds (i.e. for the second moulding step), thus validating the consistency of the
quantitative analysis as well as the utility of both model parameters. With regard to quantification of the accuracy of surface replicas, ACCFyax and Dg are
advantageous parameters for characterizing and comparing the surface morphologies. For our
study, both values were appropriate to use (with a relatively small margin of error), given the fact
that standard parameters (e.g. surface roughness) are not descriptive enough when comparing
two different surface morphologies, especially when the replication is done with biological
samples. Now that we can quantify the accuracy of surface replicas, we must determine what level of
accuracy is necessary to answer different scientific questions related to biological surfaces and


for using the replicates for bioinspired applications. The answer is not straightforward and is
completely dependent on the desired outcome of a study or application.
