The aim of the work carried out on the Erefio gilded spur was to provide the scientific community
with a practical example of the potential offered by the application of Raman imaging and
coupled SEMâ€”Raman systems in the study of iron-based archaeometallurgical artefacts.

In the first step of this work, it was demonstrated that, by combining the use of molecular
and elemental portable systems, it is possible to achieve an overall characterization of the item. In
fact, the spur alloy was successfully characterized by in situ elemental analysis, while the portable
molecular system effectively detected the main degradation product threatening its conservation.

However, data provided by the use of portable instrument need to be supported by laboratory
analysis in order to better characterize the composition of the items and estimate the magnitude
of their deterioration phenomena. In fact, owing to the elemental mapping of sample cross-
sections by SEM-EDS, the presence of a double decorative layer was observed, providing more
information about the history and the evolution of the spur. Furthermore, the molecular images
obtained from both the M03 and M04 sample cross-sections using the Raman imaging technique


allowed us to evidence the stratigraphic distribution of the iron corrosion phases detected by
in situ analysis.

The most innovative part of this work is the use of the coupled SEM-Raman system, which
enables the characterization of new degradation products. For example, Raman analysis of silver
degradation crusts, carried out by taking advantage of the magnification feature of the SEM
system, allowed us to identify the presence of silver chloride. Even if this compound is easy
