INTENSITY RELATIONS IN THE SPECTRUM OF HELIUM. 169

The other three lines are all greatly enhanced with respect to (5876. They were
selected because of the astrophysical interest attaching to these lines. The greatest
degree of enhancement occurs in 4388, which would suggest the conditions obtaining
in nebule, but there is an almost equivalent enhancement—producing in fact an
actual greater intensity—in \5015. In a previous section of this communication, we
concluded that the relative behaviour at low pressure, as regards their own individual
series, of \\4472 and 4388, reproduced the intensity relations found in the nebule.
But the corresponding effect for 45015 shows that we have not isolated the conditions
which produce the nebular intensity relations in this way. Some further condition,
which is capable of producing a diminution of intensity in \5015—with perhaps a
further enhancement of \\4472 and 4388—must be superposed. A consideration of
the results of a previous communication* relating to the effect of a condensed
discharge, suggests that the great intensity of excitation obtaining under such
conditions may be the necessary co-operative condition. It is at least evident that it
we could superpose the effects separately obtained under the two conditions—very
low pressure and the condensed discharge—a very close approximation to the actual
