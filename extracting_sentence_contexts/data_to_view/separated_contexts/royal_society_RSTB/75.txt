He put an Emys into coloured water, and observed that, when put after-
wards into clear water, it vented coloured water. He concluded from this that water was
pumped into the anal pouches, and that the latter served for hydrostatic purposes. This view has been generally accepted, and is strengthened by the fact that neither
