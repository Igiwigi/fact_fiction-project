Literature stirs and satisfies our curiosity, it interests us in other people and other
scenes, and helps us to be tolerant and generous [59]. The artistic products of imagination are significant, therefore, and not least for their power to
educate the clear-sighted operation of outward-turned imagination, over inward-turned fantasy. Fiction can open the reader to other points of view, not simply in the sense of furnishing new
ideas to consider, but also in the sense of educating us that other people are genuinely other, and
occupy alternative vantage points. As Martha Nussbaum has written, even something as basic as
being a competent citizen requires the ‘narrative imagination’ to be able ‘to think what it might be
like to be in the shoes of a person different from oneself’ [60]. This has traditionally been fostered
through literary fiction and other forms of storytelling, as an integral part of education [61].
