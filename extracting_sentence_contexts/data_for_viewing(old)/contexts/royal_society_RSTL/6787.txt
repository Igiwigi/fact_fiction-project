Seorron T.â€”INTRODUCTION, AND EARLY HISTORY.

Tas facts at the present time. generally accepted regarding the ultimate compoxsition,
and the sources of the constituents, of plants, have, for the most part, received their
preponderating weight of proof within the limits of the present century. But it is to
the century preceding it that we must look for the establishment of much that was
exxential as the foundation of those advances which have since been made.
Whatever may be the value at present attached to the particular views of Harrs
& regarding the composition and the sources of vegetable matter, we must accord to his
< labours, in the early part of the eighteenth century, the merit of having been guided by
E a proper spirit of experimental inquiry. Nor did he fail in applying to good account,
and eyen in extending, the then existing knowledge of the material things around him
= Which were apparently inyolyed in the mysterious processes of vegetable growth.
Y With our present knowledge, however, of the general composition of plants, and of
S the sources of their constituents, it is easy to see how essential was a proper under-
