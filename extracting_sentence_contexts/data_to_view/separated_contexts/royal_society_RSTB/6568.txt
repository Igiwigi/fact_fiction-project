This period of “‘phasic castration” may last nine months, and ends with the
appearance in the field of the susceptible stage of the host. The possibility that this factor of reabsorption of the eggs might be involved in the
above behaviour was investigated by the method outlined below. The fact that appreci-
able numbers of eggs were laid by the older females indicated that the reabsorption,
if any, was only partial, and this could, therefore, be most conveniently gauged by
supplying females, which had been kept for various time periods without hosts, with
large numbers of unparasitized gipsy moth eggs. Partial reabsorption of the mature
eggs of the ovaries should affect the amount of parasitism in these higher host densities. By varying the host densities it was possible to extend the scope of the experiment to
give some indication of the effect of density of the host upon the exercise of restraint.
