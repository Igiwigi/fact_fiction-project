With regard to this remarkable effect on the polypite of removing the margin of the
nectocalyx, it is now to be observed that in it we appear to have very unexceptionable
evidence of ch a relation subsisting between the ganglia of the nectocalyx and the
muscular fibres of the polypite, as elsewhere gives rise to what is known as museular
tonus, This interpretation of the facts cannot, I think, be disputed ; and ib fully
explains why, in the unmutilated animal, the degree of elongation on the part of the
polypite usnally exhibits an inverse proportion to the degree of locomotor activity
displayed by the bell. I may here state that I have also observed indications of
muscular tonus in some of the other Meduse, but for the sake of brevity I shall here
restrich myself to the consideration of this one case,

* 1 may here mention that the fact of the polypite of Sarsia undergoing this extreme elongation after

the removal of the marginal ganglia, serves to render tho artificial rhythm of the organ under the influence
of injury, as previously degcribed, all the more conspicuous,

To my mind, then, it is an interesting fact that ganglionie tissue, where it can first,
be shown to occur in the animal kingdom, has for one of its functions the maintenance
of muscular tonus ; but it is nob on this account that I now wish to draw prominent
attention to the fact before us. Physiologists are almost unanimous in regarding
