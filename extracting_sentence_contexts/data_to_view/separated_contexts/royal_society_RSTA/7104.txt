The incident pressure cannot then arrive at any point on AB (figure 6) earlier than
time —y so that

bily,t) =0 (t+y<0), (162)
whence equation (161) indicates that
F(Y¥,t)=0 (t<Y), (163)

corresponding to the propagation of a diffraction wave down the back of the half-plane. Further, it will be realized that the form of solution given by equation (161) remains
unchanged if we proceed from a source at a finite distance in the region x>0, y>0 to the
limiting case of infinite distance corresponding to a plane wave arriving obliquely from
above. For this case it can, in fact, be easily checked that equation (161) gives the known
solution in the form given by Friedlander (1946). As discussed in §2 the general solution for the pressure anywhere can be expressed in
terms of F, by means of equations (1) and (9). Alternatively, we can use equations (1) and
(7) if we know the solution for ¥.
