From the year
1892 onwards Herrwic, Driescu, Herpst, and many other observers have studied
the early development of Echinoidea under abnormal conditions, not primarily with a
view of extending our knowledge of the Echinodermata, but with the object of
investigating the general laws of development. Since a well-grown female urchin
contains about 20,000,000 eggs, it will be seen how admirably this group is suited
for the purposes of experimental embryology. Incidentally, however, a number of
facts have transpired which are of interest to the special student of Echinodermata,
amongst the more important of which we may mention Driescu’s discovery that the
cells of the blastula stage are at first potentially alike (8); that is to say that any
sufticiently large fragment of the blastula, from whatever region it is taken, will round
itself off and pursue a normal development, whereas after the mesenchyme has been
formed this is no longer possible, the cells of the animal pole being unable to form a
gut; and Herpsr’s discovery (12) that by altering the chemical constitution of the
water the gut may develop outwards instead of inwards, so that the process of
invagination is due to the existence of a lesser pressure in the interior of the blastula
than outside. It will therefore be seen that, at-the time the investigations recorded in this paper
were commenced, we possessed an exhaustive account of the developmental processes
which occurred during the first few days of larval life, a fairly coherent account of
the external features of the larva throughout the entire period of the development,
and the scantiest notices as to the internal changes which occurred after the first few
days of development and as to the relation of the organs of the larva to those of
the adult. It is the aim of the present paper to present a full and thorough description of
the steps by which the body of the adult is built up out of that of the a a task
which has not been heretofore accomplished.
