In some of the later tests the speed was lowered to 1500 r.p.m. in order to reduce the amount
of fuel.required for a test.

When the tests on methane came to be carried out, it was found that the h.u.c.r. with
an inlet air temperature of 30째 C and an engine coolant temperature of 70째 CG was in the

region of 18. This compression ratio was inconveniently high for continuous working,
particularly in view of the fact that it was proposed to try the effect of anti-knock substances
in the fuel. Accordingly, the inlet air temperature was raised to 120째 C and the engine
coolant temperature to 90째 C. The h.u.c.r. of methane under these conditions was 14 to 15,
a more convenient range for continuous testing.

The conditions under which a particular test was carried out are given in the table or
graph concerned.

Where both fuel and additive were liquid, the latter was usually added to the fuel before
test. With gaseous additives, like formaldehyde, and gaseous fuels, like methane, this was
not possible; the additives were, therefore, introduced into the inlet air stream in the
following manner. The additive was contained in a tightly corked flask into which fitted
two glass tubes. One of these tubes communicated directly with the atmosphere, and the
