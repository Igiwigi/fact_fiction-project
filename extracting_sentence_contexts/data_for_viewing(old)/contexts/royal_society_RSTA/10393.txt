Let y denote the left-hand member of the equation (89). When z is small, y is
Semall of order 2°, In fact, we have

and when z is small, the first approximation to y is —(3—4y)z°. When 2 is great,
ay e~*dt is approximately equal to $,/7; and thus y is positive when z is great. The

equation (89) has a root zero and at least one positive root. The zero root is
