The histology of the corpus luteum
The present material does not include early stages in the development of the corpus

luteum of the elephant, but certain characteristics of the stages of activity and regression
call for description. In the first place, the corpora lutea of pregnancy, which never occur
singly, together constitute a relatively large mass of luteal tissue which maintains an
apparently active condition for nearly a year. It is estimated that in some of the pregnant
animals the ovaries contained over 200 g of luteal tissue. For some time after the corpus
luteum is fully developed, the luteal cells are large, rounded and sometimes binucleate,
and the cytoplasm has a frothy appearance. They present, in fact, the structure charac-
teristic of this type of cell in the fully developed condition (figures 23a and 24a). But in
most of the available specimens the cytoplasm of the luteal cells is occupied by large
spherical globules which stain black with osmic acid and which appear as vacuoles in
preparations in which they are not preserved (figure 26, plate 8). This very marked
degree of vacuolation is evidently a process of fatty degeneration, but nevertheless appears
to represent a functional phase of the corpus luteum which persists for a long time. It
would seem that during this time substances are slowly released from the vacuoles in
a process which involves the eventual destruction of the cells. With the exhaustion of the
vacuoles the luteal cells in fact disappear, and are replaced by connective tissue elements.

Another feature is the marked orientation of the luteal tissue in a framework of connec-
tive tissue, seen in figures 23 and 24. The orientation is related to the vascular supply, and
