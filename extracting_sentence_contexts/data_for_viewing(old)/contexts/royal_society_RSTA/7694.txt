as if this were the a posterior’ probability law of the 0’s.

This procedure is perfectly justifiable on the ground of certain theories of
probability, e.g., as developed by Haroip Jerrreys, but it is not justifiable on the
ground of the theory of probability adopted in this paper. In fact, the function
fp; (9,... 0,/E’) as defined by (10) will not generally have the property serving as a
definition of the elementary probability law of the 6’s. Its integral over any region
w in the space of the 6’s will not be necessarily equal to the ratio of the measures of
two sets of elements belonging to the fundamental probability set, which we call the
probability. Consequently, if the experiment leading to the set of values of the x’s
is repeated many times and if we select such experiments (many of them) in which
the observed values were the same, x’,, x’)... x’,, the assumed validity of the law
of big numbers (in the sense of BorTKrewicz) will not guarantee that the frequency

of cases where the true value of 0; falls within 6, —-A<0< 6, + A will approach
the value of (8), if this is calculated from (10). Moreover, if the 0’s are
constant, this frequency will be permanently zero or unity, thus essentially differing
