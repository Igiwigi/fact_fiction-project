4, 7, 9, 1841), and remarked that in both
species these bodies come from the yelk before segmentation is commenced, and that their presence indicates
that the body of the Limaz will be formed on that side of the yelk at which they appear. Nevertheless Vax
Bexevex, observing that they are suspended for a time in the transparent fluid which surrounds the yelk from
which they proceed, believed that they become dissolved in this fluid and do not take any direct part in the
formation of the embryo; and although he appears to have regarded them as the representatives of the Purkin-
Jean vexicle, he seems to have doubted whether this body plays the important part which has been attributed
to it in the higher animals. At the same time he called attention to the fact of the constancy of these vezicles
in Lymneus, Limaz and Aplysia as meriting consideration. Yet Karscn, who afterwards saw the vesicles in
Lymnaus (Wiz@xaxN's Arch. xii. 1846, p. 255), thought their presence an abnormal condition.
