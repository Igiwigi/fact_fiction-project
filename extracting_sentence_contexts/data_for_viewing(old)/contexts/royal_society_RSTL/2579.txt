to the office of the suborbital division-of this nerve, since it has given occasion
to the revisal of the anatomy#*.

We were: inyolyed in great confusion by the discovery of new branches of
nerves and of ganglions, through which we had no guide, until we formed a
correct arrangement of the whole system. It. is satisfactory to find that the
ideas first suggested by a comparison between the roots of the nerves and their
complex distribution in the face and neck are. correct, when tried by a minute
investigation of the internal nerves of the head; and that the conelusions
drawn. from the anatomy, are confirmed |hoth by experiment. and by a know-
ledge of the effects of injuries and of disease in the human frame,

App1TI0NaL NoTE.—As the most important fact in this paper is that ascer-
tained by experiments on the fifth nerve, I am bound to say by whom they
were made, and for what purpose,,,

To my late brother-in-law Mr. Joun, SHaw, whom I educated, 1 have been
indebted through the whole of this inquiry. He had long been acquainted in
the most intimate manner with my pursuits. He had repeated my experiments
on the roots of the spinal nerves, confirming the results,—that the anterior
roots when irritated caused the muscles to, contract, and that the posterior
roots had no such influence.

He assisted me in my experiments on the nerves of the face, which were for
the purpose of establishing that the fifth pair resembled the nerves of the spine,
