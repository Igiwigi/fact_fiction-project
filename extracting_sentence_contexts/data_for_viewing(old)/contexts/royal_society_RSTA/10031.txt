greater molecular weight of a benzene homologue shifts all the bands towards the red,
though it is apparent that certain of the bands are so shifted ; it is also clear that
certain groups of bands are common to benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and o-xylene,
and that these are the bands affected. But the weighting of the molecule, besides
diminishing the number of the vapour bands, causes the general absorption to extend
further towards the rays of longer wave-length. At constant pressure the effect of
rise of temperature might be expected to cause an increased number of molecules to
cross the path of the rays, which is the same in effect as increasing the quantity
of substance, or lengthening the column of vapour; reduction of pressure would
therefore be expected to have an opposite effect, by reducing their number and
increasing the mean path of the molecules—the absorption bands, if caused by
vibrations within the molecule, would as a consequence become more distinct. This
is, in fact, what is actually seen in the least refrangible groups, between AA 2750 and
2500, particularly when benzene vapour is maintained at 100°C. and the pressure is
gradually reduced to 4mm. (See fig. 2; for the wave-lengths also Table VIL.) The
quantity of benzene in the 79 ¢.c. is only 0:0011 grm. in weight, at 4 mm. pressure.

It has been experimentally shown that increase of mass, of density, and of tempera-
ture operate in the same manner upon the rays entering a column of benzene vapour :
in the first place, the general absorption is increased by an extension towards the
visible rays and it is also intensified ; in the second place, the bands of absorption
broaden, become diffuse, and coalesce. As the bands attributed to the internal
vibrations of the parts of the molecule in different isomeric hydrocarbons become
diffuse and coalesce, partaking of the character of the general absorption, and as this
is not confined to one part of the spectrum, namely to the less refrangible or trans-
