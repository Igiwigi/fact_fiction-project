1. Corrections of political misinformation: no evidence for an
effect of partisan worldview

Misinformation, defined as false information that is presented as valid, often
has a continuing influence on peopleâ€™s reasoning even after it has been clearly
and credibly corrected, and even when people remember the correction. This
effect is known as the continued influence effect (CIE; [1-3]).

Most studies demonstrating a CIE have used fictional event reports. For
example, Johnson & Seifert [4] presented participants with a scenario regarding
a fictitious warehouse fire, purportedly caused by the negligent storage of vola-
tile materials. Participants who were subsequently informed that the volatile
materials did not cause the fire continued to rely on the discredited misinfor-
mation when responding to inferential-reasoning questions about the event
(e.g. why the fire was difficult to extinguish). This research has established
that the CIE is driven at least in part by cognitive factors, such as failures of
information integration, memory updating and retrieval [5-11].

However, it seems like a truism that motivational factors also play a role,
