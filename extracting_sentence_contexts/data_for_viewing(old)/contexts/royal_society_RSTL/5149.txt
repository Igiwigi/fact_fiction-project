However, among the multitude of preparations capable of being acted on by light, it is probable
that there may be some which are acted on mainly by rays of unusually high refrangibility, and which,
on that very account, would not be suitable for the ordinary purposes of photography. With these
it is possible that the new region of the solar spectrum might be taken photographically.

I have since examined the salt, or product, whatever it may be, in the dry state, and under more
favourable cireumstances, and have found it sensitive, though not by any means in a high degree.
It exhibits also the absorption bands which seem to run through the salts of peroxide of uranium,

In connexion with the insensibility of a solution of nitrate of uranium in ether, it seems interest-
ing to mention a fact which I have since observed, namely, that the sensibility of a solution of
nitrate of uranium in water is destroyed by the addition of a little alcohol.

On repeating this experiment on a subsequent occasion, I could not satisfactorily make out the
difference of character of a strong and of a weak spark from the prime conductor, perhaps because
the machine was in less vigorous action ; but the difference between the effects of a mere spark and
of the discharge from a Leyden jar was plainly evident. I would here warn the reader, that in order
to perform the experiment in 8uch a manner as to obtain a striking and perfectly decisive result, it
is essential to employ an excessively weak solution. The reason of this is evident.

A severe thunder-storm which visited Cambridge on the evening of July 16, 1852, afforded me a
