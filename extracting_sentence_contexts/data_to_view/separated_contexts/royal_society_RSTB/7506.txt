8, plate 15, figure 3, F 10662; 9, F 10811; 10, F 10812. Remarks. Differs from B. arabicum in the fact that all, instead of only some, of the ribs
spring from a tubercle; in the coarser, more distant ribs; in the more numerous tubercles;
and in the stouter whorl. Theveninâ€™s pl. ii, fig. 13, may belong to this species, if the
(hidden) inner whorls are not bituberculate.
