Thus there are O(Q?) terms in (3.4)
when compared with the DFT representation which has N terms.

(b) Relation to Ramanujan sums

Recall that the Ramanujan sum is defined as in (1.1). Clearly, the Ramanujan sum cq(n) belongs to the
Ramanujan space S,. In fact, cg(n) can be used to generate a real, integer, basis for the Ramanujan

2The elements of 8, can either be regarded as length-q vectors or as infinite length vectors with elements repeating with
period q, depending on what is more convenient in a particular context.


space S;. Thus, it can be shown [12] that the $(q) successively shifted signals

Cq(1), Cq(n — 1),...,¢q( — (9) + 1) (3.11)

are linearly independent and form a basis for Sj. Since cq(n) has period q, the sequence c,(n — k)
is a circularly right-shifted version of cq(n), the amount of shift being k samples.
