Sf the cubic curve (*Lz, y, 2*=0 meets the curve in a point (E, 1, Z), which is the tan-
Jeontial of the first-mentioned point; and I showed that when the cubic is represented
Zn the canonical form a*+z*+2*+67zy2=0, the coordinates of the tangential may be
taken to be a(y*—2*) : y(2—3®): 2(2*—z*). The method given for obtaining the tangen-
ial may be applied to the general form (a. 6, c, F. 9g, h,i,j, k, 1X, 9, 2)*: it seems desirable,
Sn reference to the theory of cubic forms, to give the expression of the tangential for the
General form; and this is what I propose to do, merely indicating the steps of the
-Salculation, which was performed for me by Mr. Creepy. = The cubic form is

hore a, g, h are arbitrary coefficients; but as it is not obvious how these coefficients
ould be determined in order to present the result in the most simple form, I have given
the result in the form in which it was obtained without the adjunction of any such term. Write for shortness
