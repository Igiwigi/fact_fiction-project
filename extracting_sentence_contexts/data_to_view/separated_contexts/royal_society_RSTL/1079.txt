1. Introduction. Ix the Philosophical Transactions for 1807, Part I. and 1808,
Part I. I have detailed the general methods of decomposi-
tion by electricity, and stated various new facts obtained in
consequence of the application of them. The results of the experiments on potash and soda, as I
stated in my last communication to the Society, afforded me
the strongest hopes of being able to effect the decomposition
both of the alkaline and common earths; and the phenomena
obtained in the first imperfect trials made upon those bodies
countenanced the ideas | that had obtained from the earliest
periods of chemistry, of their being metallic in their nature. *
