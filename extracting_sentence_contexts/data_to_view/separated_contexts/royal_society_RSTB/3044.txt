Apparently he assumes the structure of intumescences in leaves and
on stems to be always the same. But it seems to me that the difference between
hypertrophy and hyperplasy is one of degree only, and therefore non-essential. In
fact, Kister himself{ says that in higher plants the cells of any tissue which can
form a hypertrophy can also form a hyperplasy, and that no distinct line can be
drawn between the two. Internal and external factors, he says, determine whether
a hypertrophy or a hyperplasy will be formed. Other hypertrophic (or hyperplastic)
tissues also show similarities in structure to intumescences and callus, notably galls,
whether due to vegetable or animal parasites.
