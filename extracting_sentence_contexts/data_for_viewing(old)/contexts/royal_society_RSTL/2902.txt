would be consistent with the probable errors of observation. In oil of cassia, how-
ever, I have found that the errors, eyen when thus distributed among all the indices,
are $till too great.

2. The constants a and b are derived solely from the values of > for each ray, taken
from the well-known determinations of Frauxnorts from interference. It is doubt-
less possible that these determinations may be affected by errors. In computing, by
the method here used, some of FraunnoreR's indices, in which small discrepancies
were found, Sir W. R. Hamrrox undertook to investigate what amount of alteration
in the values of A would account for those differences. He communicated his re-
searches in a letter to myself, with the values of x, and consequently those of @ and b,
thus altered. I have repeated the calculation for oil of cassia, but find this change
quite insufficient to remove the discrepancy ; and that, in fact, a much larger altera-
tion than could for a moment be allowed in Frauxnortr's data, must be supposed,
in order to produce any sensible effect.

3. The entire method of computation here followed, though founded on the exclu-
sion of those approximate suppositions which are allowed in the simpler formula, is
yet dependent on the omission of terms in the series for p beyond the three first*,
