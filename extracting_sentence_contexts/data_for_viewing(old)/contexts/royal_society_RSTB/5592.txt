spond with those published by Frorran (1930, 6), and were constructed on the basis of
the figures of sections published in Strmve’s paper. As we (FLORIAN, 1930, 6) have
already shown, the embryo is not cut transversely, but obliquely ; the recognition of
this fact explains the asymmetry of the specimen (especially that of the primitive
streak) mentioned by Steve. The cloacal membrane, according to FLorran (1928, a,
p- 545; 1930, 6), is to be found in sections 60-62 (figs. 31-32 in Srmeve’s paper),
its connection with the endoderm being close to the point designated in Srreve’s
fig. 31 as “ Sichelknoten,” the connection with the ectoderm in fig. 32 being designated
as “ Blutinsel”” ; the connection between these two is present in section 61, the figure
of which was not published. If we observe the position of the primitive streak in
Srreve’s figures, we notice that as we pass back in the series the streak gradually
approaches nearer to the right margin of the embryonal shield ; the cloacal membrane
(in Srteve’s fig. 31) being situated actually at that margin. This fact clearly indicates

that the specimen is not cut transversely. We have estimated that the sectional
plane forms an angle of about 64° with the median plane, and an angle of about 26°
with the transverse plane, and is perpendicular to the embryonal shield. We have
measured this specimen in the reconstructions made in accordance with these estimates,
and naturally there are some small differences between our measurements and those of
Srieve.
