section being at a lower level than the proximal. Thus, in fig. 17 the distal
extremity is missed, the plane of section here passing below the sporophyll. The
vascular bundle of the sporophyll appears at three places, twice at the proximal and
once at the distal end. On entering the sporophyll it made a sharp curve, which is
clearly shown in some of the radial sections.t| The fact that the attachment of the
sporangium is seen near the distal end, and that the bundle reappears in this region,
indicates that the pedicel of the sporophyll was curved, with its convexity down-
wards, an inference confirmed by the radial sections. The sporangium shows the
usual structure and contains a large megaspore, much contracted. It may be
mentioned that the membrane of the megaspore in this species shows an irregularly
reticulated structure. Fig. 18, representing the third section from below (the
intermediate one not being figured), is of greater interest. The marked narrowing
of the ‘‘ seed” towards the proximal end is due to the fact that the plane of section
here passes through the micropylar region. The contracted megaspore is still visible ;
the sporangium is free from the sporophyll; between the two at the distal end, and
seated in a depression of the sporophyll-tissue, is a delicate crescent-shaped body (/g),
which from its position, form, and structure is evidently the ligule. It is shown,
more highly magnified, in fig. 19, from which we see that the ligule consists of an
extremely delicate tissue, a dark body in each cell no doubt representing the
contracted and carbonised cell-contents. The ligule is cut transversely, as must
necessarily be the case in an approximately horizontal section of the sporophyll.

* By horizontal I mean in a plane parallel to the sporophyll-pedicel, and transverse with reference to the
axis of the parent strobilus. Compare above, p. 302.
