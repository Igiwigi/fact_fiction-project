The orange circles indicate results from paradigm 1
(AM paradigm) whereas the dark blue circles indicate the results from paradigm 2 (Fade paradigm). The ordinate is scaled such that the upper half of the graph
(from 0 to +1) indicates when the responses corresponded more to ‘synchronous’ tones being heard and the lower half of the graph (from 0 to — 1) indicates
when the responses corresponded more to ‘alternating’ tones being heard.
