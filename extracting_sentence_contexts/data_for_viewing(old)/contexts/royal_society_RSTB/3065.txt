theory leaves the immediate cause of menstruation and “heat” quite un-
explained.*

Other authors besides Bearp have laid stress on the rhythmical nature of
menstruation. Thus Stevenson (1882) has advanced the “ menstrual-wave ” theory,
according to which the metabolic processes gradually increase in intensity until the
time of the catamenia, when they suddenly decline to their lowest point, after which
they gradually rise again, and the process is repeated (cf. JoHNsTONE, 1886, 1895 ;
Wesster, 1897 ; Geppgs and THomson, 1901). According to this theory menstrua-
tion and the ovarian functions are in no way inter-dependent, but are related only
in so far as each may be brought about by the same cause. This theory is disproved
by the fact, which may now be regarded as well established, that menstruation and
“heat” cease after ovariotomy,f the small proportion of cases in which they are
said to continue being explained on the hypothesis that the ovaries had not both
been entirely extirpated (cf Knauer, 1899, for Rabbits, and Harpan, 1901, for
Monkeys ; vide also our remarks on this subject below).

In the present place it remains for us to refer to FRAENKEL’s hypothesis (19038),
according to which menstruation is caused by the activity of the corpus luteum.t
This hypothesis is based upon nine cases in which the corpus luteum was destroyed
by the cautery, in eight of which the next menstruation is said to have been missed.
In our opinion FRAENKEL’s theory is disproved by the fact stated above that
ovulation in the Bitch does not occur until cestrus, and consequently that at the
time of the procestrum there are no corpora lutea present in the ovary, for the
