With a general move towards miniaturization in technology, understanding the principles
of elasto-capillarity is crucial. For example, standard fabrication techniques for building micro-
electromechanical systems involve wet etching, and in the drying process flexible parts become
susceptible to stiction [4]. This can deform or even break components, thereby compromising
the functionality of the device. On the positive side, capillarity can be used in the design of
microstructures, as illustrated by the development of passive pipetting techniques [5] and by
alternative approaches to self-assembly [6]. Other applications include the formation of foams by
evaporating water from a vertical array of multiwalled nanotubes [7], the engineering of highly
hydrophobic surfaces in the form of coated carbon nanotubes [8], and the fact that locomotion of
robots and insects on interfaces is facilitated by means of flexible appendages [9,10].

One particular promising aspect of elasto-capillarity is the ability of surface tension to fold
planar objects, possibly with hinges, into three-dimensional structures [6]. For elastic sheets,
this process is known as capillary origami [11,12]. It could potentially lead to a new self- : =
assembling approach to microscale manufacturing that is an alternative to standard methods, 3
such as photolithography, which involves the deposition and etching of thin films [13] and is
essentially two-dimensional. Applications have already been proposed to efficiently produce nee)
three-dimensional photovoltaic cells [14] and to form graphene nanostructures [15]. :

The concept of capillary origami was developed by Py et al. [11,12], who demonstrated that a a]
variety of three-dimensional structures, such as tubes, pyramids and spheres, could be created by DN
