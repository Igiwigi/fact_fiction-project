It was found that a better way to make use of this optical method of obtaining a
constant temperature was to determine the change of resistance required to keep the
filaments equally bright when the pressure was varied, and to use the results thus
got to correct the readings for the leak at constant resistance to what they would be
at constant temperature according to the optical criterion. This procedure may
appear pointless at first sight, but it is not. The advantage of it lies in the fact that
it separates the difficulties of the optical regulation process from those which are due
to the vagaries of the leak itself. The leak then was measured with the wire heated
so that its resistance remained constant; this is done by the purely mechanical
process of keeping a galvanometer spot at the middle of a scale, so that all the
attention of the observer could be devoted to the actual measurement of the leak
itself. Similarly, in finding the way the resistance changed for the same brightness,
all the attention could be devoted to seeing when the two wires were equally bright.
