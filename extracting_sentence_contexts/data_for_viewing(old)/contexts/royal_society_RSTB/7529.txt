regarding the actual contacts is either valueless or superfluous—indeed, for some purposes
it may be important—but that it is information which by itself gives no clear idea of
phyllotaxis proper; in conjunction with such a measure as phyllotaxis index it provides very
full data indeed as to the geometry at the apex.

Estimates of phyllotaxis index may be obtained from several of the sectional drawings of
apices presented by Snow & Snow; the methods used are similar to those adopted when
assessing the Dryopteris apices of Wardlaw, but owing to the fact that transverse sections
nowreplace the plan of the apex, for reasons given above (p. 538) it is necessary to confine the
measurements to a smaller number of the youngest primordia. At least this is so when,
owing to the fact that only a few isolated sections from any apex are presented, the measure-
ments must be confined to a single section. This may well increase the error of determina-
tion, although in fact the Lupinus apex appears to be more regular than that of Dryopteris.
A number of determinations on single sections have led to phyllotaxis indices ranging
from 2-8 to 3-3, and usually a little higher than 3-0.

For a few of the apices depicted, however, it is possible to obtain estimates derived from
two sections, using two selected primordia each measured at the particular level where it
is just breaking completely free from the axis. Such an estimate may be compared with a
