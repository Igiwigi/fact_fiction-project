Various software modules
support the deployment configuration, maintenance and general administration of the platform’s
components.

6. Optimization

Many research projects and industrial companies are working towards the realization of Industry
4.0 and the self-organizing factory. In this context, several leading academics have recently
commented on the fact that the real core concept of Industry 4.0 is related to optimization, as
discussed in §1. Once the necessary connectivity has been realized to enable the collection of
good quality data capable of forming the basis of actionable insights derived from the multitude
of devices, the challenge is dynamically optimizing production through both local and global
adaptations. Decision support and optimization of manufacturing processes in real-time are demanding
tasks.
