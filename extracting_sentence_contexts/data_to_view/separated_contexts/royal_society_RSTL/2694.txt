The neryous power
we have found to be a modification of one of the latter principles, because it can
exist in other textures than those to which it belongs in the living animal, and we
can substitute for it one of those principles without disturbing the functions of life. Late discoveries have been gradually evincing how far more extensive, than was
supposed, even a few years ago, is the dominion of Electricity. Magnetism, chemical
affinity and (I believe, from the facts stated in the foregoing paper, it will be impos-
sible to avoid the conclusion) the neryous influence, the leading power in the vital
functions of the animal frame properly s0 called, appear all of them to be modifica-
tions of this apparently universal agent; for I may add, we havye already some
glimpses of its still more extensive dominion. IN the preceding paper my objects have been to review the whole of the functions
of the more perfect animal, to ascertain the nature of the powers on which they de-
pend, the seat of each of these powers, the manner in which they are employed in
effecting their several functions, and the manner in which they are associated in pro-
ducing their more complicated results. Nothing in any part of the subject has been
taken for granted, no position having been advanced without a reference to the obser-
vations or experiments on which it is founded.
