We do not surely in all this see any
difference in the nature of the muscular power of the heart,
and that of the muscles of voluntary motion, except their
being fitted to obey different stimuli, a difference which we
find in the two sides of the heart itself. It may here be objected, that in apoplexy the power of the
muscles of voluntary motion is lost, while that of the heart is
little or not at all impaired. Were such the fact, this objec-
tion would be unanswerable; but I have repeatedly examined
the: state of the -muscles of voluntary motion in apoplexy,

82 Dr. Pn1Lie's experiments to ascertain the principle

both'in the warm and cold blooded animals, and found their
excitability unimpaired. It is not their power, but the 8ti-
mulus which excites them, that is lost in apoplexy. In this
disease, the heart continues to contract; because its stimulus is
ﬆtill supplied; the muscles of voluntary motion cease to con-
tract, because their stimulus'is withdrawn.
