. 1107 years. Secondly, we see that in all of the three cases the time from a minimum to the next
maximum is less than that from a maximum to the next minimum,â€”a fact which has,
we think, been previously noticed by Sir J. HersoneL, Thus the time from the first
minimum to the next maximum is 3-06 years, and from the firs: maximum to the second
minimum 6:75 years. In like manner that from the second minimum to the next maxi-
mum is 4-14 years, and from the second maximum to the third minimum $:44 years,
Finally, the time from the third minimum to the third maximum is 3:37 years, and from
the third maximum to the fourth minimum 7:44 years. We see again that the second
curve, which was longer in period as a whole than either of the other two, manifests this
excess in each of its branches, that is to say, its left or ascending branch is larger as a
whole than the same branch of the other two curves, and the same takes place for the
Second or descending branch.
