Using the same data, viz., the indication given by the temperature, we see that the
descending current of the anticyclone starts from a height of about 11 km. and also
spreads out as it descends ; it, too, forms part of a cone, but has the apex upwards.
Unlike the upward cyclonic current, its intensity slackens some distance before the
end of its course, neither does the current seem to be so pronounced, since the
departure only reaches +5° C. against —10° C. for the cyclone (29°00 in.).

The nature of the circulation thus indicated agrees well with what is known from
other sources. The ascending current in the lower part of a cyclone can be inferred
with certainty from the inward tend of the surface winds; it is also proved by the
formation of clouds and rain. That the region of ascending air increases with height
may be deduced from the fact that the formation of cirrus is often the first sign of an
advancing cyclone, and rain may fall from high clouds some time before the lower
cloud sheet and scud are formed. Also high clouds are generally visible after the
lower sheet has cleared when the depression is passing away.

The descending current of the anticyclone is proved by the absence of high cloud
at the centre of an anticyclone, for no cloud can remain uneyaporated in a descending
current, also by the great dryness that prevails at such times on mountain summits.
But the descending current does not reach the earth at the centre, for Messrs. SHaw
and Lemprert, in their ‘ Life-History of Surface Air Currents’ (M.O. 174, p. 24), state :
“These latter,” 7.¢., the central areas of well-marked anticyclones near the ground,
“are for the most part inert and comparatively isolated masses of air, taking little
part in the circulation that goes on around them.” Also, in England at all events,
