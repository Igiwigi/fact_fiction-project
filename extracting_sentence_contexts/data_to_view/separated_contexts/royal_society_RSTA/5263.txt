The key
motivation for seamless prediction studies is that by developing weather and climate simulators
that are as similar to one another as possible, insights and constraints from weather time scales
(where verification data are relatively plentiful) can be brought to bear on the climate time scale
(where verification data are less plentiful). However, in practice, ‘seams’ are inevitably apparent in
moving from weather and climate simulators, even though these simulators may share common
dynamical cores and parametrizations. Not least is the seam arising from the fact that weather and
climate simulators typically have different resolutions. A way to lessen this ‘resolution seam’ may
be possible using the ideas presented in this paper. That is to say, instead of changing from high
to low resolution as one moves from weather to climate prediction, it may be possible instead to
scale-selectively degrade precision with a single fixed resolution.
