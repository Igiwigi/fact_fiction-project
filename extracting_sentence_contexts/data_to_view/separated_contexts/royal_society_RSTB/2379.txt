The case of Loxsoma strengthens this suggestion,
for in it we see that cells which are typically indurated may remain thin-walled, or
even isolated cells of the part usually thin may be thick-walled. This shows a want Â©
of constancy of the induration in an individual case. Again, in Thyrsopteris, the
large sporangium has an irregular annulus, oblique in position, of which the induration
is incomplete on one side, and it is an interesting fact in this connection that the
actual point of dehiscence is not uniform in this case. Matonia, again, though it
maintains characters of the sorus and sporangium which suggest comparison with
Glvichenia, has a lateral dehiscence determined in position by the incomplete annulus. OF SPORE-PRODUCING MEMBERS. 103

It is to be noted that in these cases there is no highly specialised stomium, such as is
found in many Leptosporangiate Ferns.
