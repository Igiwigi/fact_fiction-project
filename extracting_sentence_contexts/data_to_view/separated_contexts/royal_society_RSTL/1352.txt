Ws I recollect the many learned men who have given this
lecture, I cannot but feel myself much flattered by the honour
of being named to that office ; I feel, at the same time, my own
inability to explain many of the phenomena of muscular mo-
tion ; yet more its principle, the subject to which this lecture
was originally confined. The many, and perhaps insuperable, difficulties which ob-
struct our progress towards that knowledge, have led the ablest
anatomists and physiologists, who have been called upon by
this learned Society for their observations upon muscular mo-
tion, to deviate from the original intention of the founder, and
instead of attempting an investigation of the principle, to ex-
plain the anatomical structure, and various phenomena of
muscles with which they were acquainted ; that by this means
they might furnish data for future inquiries. I $hall consider the example of such men as sufficient au-
thority for not confining myself too closely to the subject pre-
scribed ; and content myself with giving such facts and obser-
vations respecting muscles, as have not, I believe, been already
laid before this learned Society. This lecture was given for several years by Mr. HUNTER,


Mr. Home's Lecture, &c. 203

who till continues to prosecute the subject ; and should the
following observations contain any new materials, it is from
that source that many of them are derived : for in my pecu-
liar situation, I should little merit the honourable task assigned
to me, were I not to avail myself of every advantage in my
power, that could make the present lecture worthy the atten-
tion of this learned audience. The principle of action in an animal, appears to beas exten-
sive as life itself, and is almost the only criterion by ESTA we
can distinguish living matter from dead.
