Millions of research hours had been devoted to this problem of ‘differential aptitude’ before
I learnt of its existence. Happily, though, my ignorance of the literature was complete: if I
had had even a smattering, I should certainly have tackled something else.

In my own early days, there was a similar situation with regard to the monumental thesis of
Warner Tjardus Koiter at Delft [9], which appeared, written in Dutch, immediately after the war
in 1945. It was not until 1967 that it was translated into English by NASA: and very recently a set
of Koiter’s lecture notes were published [10]. As I wrote in 1973 in the preface of my book with
Giles Hunt on A General Theory of Elastic Stability [11]:

For several years the first author was blissfully unaware of the classic dissertation of Prof
W. T. Koiter which had surprisingly lain largely unknown since 1945 and has in fact only
recently been translated into English by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration of
America. This was indeed most fortunate since the weight of Prof Koiter’s contribution
could well have discouraged him from proceeding with his own development of the
subject. As it transpired, the full significance of Prof Koiter’s work has filtered slowly
into our consciousness in a gentle stream, moderated by the Dutch language and by our
temperaments which have invariably preferred to explore the field for ourselves. This
having been said, we must nevertheless hasten to admit our deep indebtedness to Prof
Koiter’s work, which we hope is adequately acknowledged in the text.

Koiter later referred to these remarks [12], writing ‘at University College London ... a similar
approach for discrete elastic systems was developed more or less independently, as described so
eloquently in the preface by Thompson and Hunt in their monograph’.
