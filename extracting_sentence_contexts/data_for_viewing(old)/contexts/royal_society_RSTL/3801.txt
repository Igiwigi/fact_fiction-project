92. I have the satisfaction of stating that since the foregoing memoir was pre-
sented to the Society, many gentlemen have afforded me the opportunity of demon-
strating to them, either with my own microscope, or with instraments made by
PowELL, Ross, or SmiTH, the leading facts recorded in it. To one of them (the 80n
of an eminent physiologist, Dr. Bosrock) I am indebted for sketches of some of the
appearances he saw. 'Two of these (figs. 145, 146) represent the filament within blood-
discs : another (fig. 144) shows a similar filament constituting the muscular fibril.
At «, this filament is on its edge: at Þ, it presents its flat snrface. What gives pe-
culiar value to these sketches, is that they were made by one who then for the first
time saw the objects in question.

Facts observed in the Coagulation of the Blood,

93. In the examination of coagulating blood, discs are seen having two very differ-
ent appearances: the one kind comparatively pale, the other very red. It is the
latter discs in which a filament is to be found, and which enter into the formation of
the clot: the former being merely entangled in it, or remaining in the serum. Ob-
Servers having directed their attention almost exclusively to the undeveloped discs
80 remaining in the serum, it is not surprising that they did not discern the filament
in question : or that they supposed the blood-discs to be of subordinate importance,
and to have no concern in the eyolution of the fibrin.

94. In order to see distinctly the filament within blood-discs, some chemical re-
agent should be added, that will remove a portion of the red colouring matter, with-
