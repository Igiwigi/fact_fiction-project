The recognition of these ossified cells in their isolated
state will be followed by the observation of similar cells occupying the Haversian
canals and cancellar spaces in the majority of microscopic preparations of adult bone
(Plate VI. fig. 5 a) ; and the same may sometimes be seen on the outer surface of bone
(Plate VII. fig. 18). The appearance of the cells is, however, liable to be modified by
the various cireumstances which operate upon growing bone, such as the presence
of a tendon, or of a large pulsating vessel, or in fact, by pressure from any cause. Thus if situated in the immediate neighbourbood of a tendon, they assume an elon-
gated form ; while on the other hand they may be flattened by pressure. It has been thought desirable to describe the ossified lacunal cells at this place, on
account, of their frequent occurrence in adult bone (Plate VI.
