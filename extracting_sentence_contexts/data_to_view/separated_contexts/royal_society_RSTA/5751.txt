With the above assumptions, one may implement the Bianchi
identity (2.5) as a constraint in a path-integral, via a pseudoscalar (axion-like) Lagrange multiplier
field b(x). After the H,») path-integration, then, one arrives at an effective action for the dynamics
of the early epoch of the string-inspired Universe [44-46], which, upon the assumption of constant
dilatons, contains only gravitons and the now dynamical field b(x), canonically normalized,
without potential, which corresponds to the massless string-model-independent gravitational (or
KR) axion field [48,77]:

sett = Jax=s [-5 aak+5 siubil'b — fe K#(w),,b(x) + ‘|, (2.8)

where we have used (2.7), setting A=0, and performed appropriately the integration by parts,
taking into account that fields and their first derivatives vanish at space-time infinity. We note that

2Using local field redefinition ambiguities [41,42,48,67-70], which do not affect the perturbative string scattering amplitudes
[71,72], one can extend the torsion interpretation of 1 to O(a’) effective actions, which include fourth-order derivative terms.


classically, in (3 + 1) dimensional space-times, the duality between Hyp and b(x) is provided by
the relation (corresponding to saddle points of the H path-integral) [48,65]

— 3V 20,6 = \/—8eurpa He”. (2.9)

The ellipses ... in (2.8) denote subdominant, for our purposes, higher derivative terms (in fact
an infinity of them), but also other axions, arising from compactification in string theory [77],
which have been discussed in [44] but will not be the focus of our present study. The reader
should note the presence of anomalous CP-violating couplings of the KR axion to gravitational
anomalies in the action (2.8). These will play an important role in inducing an RVM inflation in
our string-inspired cosmology [43-46].
