concentration of polystyrene, reaching eightfold and 13-fold,
respectively, of that of the non-particle control at the highest,
40 pg ml ' concentration [amine-modified NPs (P), carboxyl-
modified NPs (P)]. This was associated with a corresponding,
approximately 50% decrease in SP-D levels in the supernatant
samples, at 5g ml’ and above, of amine- and carboxyl-
modified NPs [amine-modified NPs (S), carboxyl-modified
NPs (S)]. It was only possible to reveal a significant decrease
in the supernatant SP-D content when adsorption of SP-D to
the corresponding NM was particularly high, usually at the
greatest NM concentrations. This might reflect relatively high
levels of SP-D originally present in the supernatant fraction, as
well as the fact that immunoblotting is not sufficiently sensitive
to reveal a slight decrease of SP-D level in such a sample.

When the same experiment was performed with 50 nm
polystyrene NPs, the only significant increase in SP-D adsorp-
tion was with the carboxy]-modified particles, which increased
with concentration but only reached 1.8-fold that of the
