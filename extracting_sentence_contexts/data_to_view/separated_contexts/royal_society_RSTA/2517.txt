Objectives for a universal notion of proof identity

The lack of understanding of the nature of proofs has its cause in the very fundamentals of proof
theory: we study formal proofs as syntactic objects that are represented in some formal proof systent,
and we cannot consider the proof independently from that system. In that respect, we can say
that current proof theory is not a theory of proofs, but a theory of proof systems. In fact, most of the
important theorems of proof theory, like soundness, completeness, cut admissibility, focusing
or proof complexity results are not about proofs but about proof systems. All notions of proof
identity that exist are between proofs within the same proof system, as it is not clear what it
means to compare two formal proofs that are given in two different proof systems.

(a) Existing notions of proof identity

Up to now, there exist only four notions of proof identity, and two of them are trivial: (1) two
proofs are the same if they prove the same theorem, and (2) two proofs are the same if they are
syntactically equal. They have already been ruled out by Hilbert, and there is no need to discuss
them further here.
