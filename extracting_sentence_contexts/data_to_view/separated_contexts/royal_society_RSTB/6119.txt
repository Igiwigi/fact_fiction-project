The method employed in this study has
been that of injection of the living embryo, followed either by rendering the tissues
transparent in a whole mount, or by the preparation of serial sections. The attempt has been made, whenever possible, to trace definitive blood vessels
from an antecedent capillary plexus, as well as to study their changes subsequent
to the attainment of definitive form. No facts contrary to the view that blood
vessels are in general preceded by an antecedent capillary plexus have been disclosed. The tracing of veins and arteries from a common antecedent plexus has disclosed
relationships which could only receive recognition in a study which dealt with both
types of blood vessel. The necessity for such simultaneous study is emphasized.
