The age at which the animal attains its full size. In respect to the second point: as Mr. HaRRis caught the female Echidna with the
young, about an inch in length, on the 12th of August, she may be impregnated at the
latter end of June or in July. Females killed in the last week of July and the first
week of August, in the Province of Victoria, would be most likely to afford the capital
facts noted under the fourth head ; viz. the impregnated ovum #n utero showing some
stage of embryonal development in the spiny terrestrial Monotreme. As to the hairy
and aquatic Ornithorhynchus, the impregnated females in which ova were found in the
uterus, of 8mall size, and prior to the formation of the embryo, were caught on the 6th
and 7th of October*.
