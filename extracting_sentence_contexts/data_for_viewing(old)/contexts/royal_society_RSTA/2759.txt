horizontal is used to capture five images.

For the reasons of copyright, I cannot copy these images from Cattâ€™s paper. But, they were
taken in the following points: (A) across the terminator 75-ohm resistor, (B) 25% to the left of the
reed switch (4.5m), (C) 50% to the left of the reed switch (9m), (D) 75% to the left of the reed
switch (13.5 m), (E) at the extreme left of the open end of the cable (figure 6).


(d) What if the load is a self-timed digital circuit?

When I asked myself a question of what the law of discharging a capacitor via a self-timed
switching circuit is, I had already suspected that it was not a normal exponential process that
we see in an RC circuit with a constant R. Clearly the fact that the switching circuit forms a
voltage-controlled impedance would affect the discharging process. Theoretically, one can try to
produce a model of resistor R and apply it at every step of the discharging process. But then the
question arises, what if the dynamics of change of R is not related to the dynamics of the capacitor
discharge? While it would still be interesting to study the discharging process for a TL in place
of a lumped C, here we can consider the model of discharging a lumped capacitor via a digital
switching circuit as the first step in this direction. Here, we will focus on the step-wise process
associated with the changes in the resistive load due to switching from one destination capacitor

to another capacitor and modelling the dynamics of the delay in such switching. As a self-timed :2
digital switching circuit, we consider a ring oscillator. The original details of this derivation can : =
