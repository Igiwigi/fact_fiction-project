Now in P’
1=8'c'.¢d'.d'b'! =a'u' uy’ vl =a. Thus the canonic mapping # maps the element a+1 of the amalgam on to aJ =a’ = 1;
hence @ is not one-to-one and the amalgam is not embeddable in a group. In fact @ acts as
a proper homomorphism on each constituent group, that is, it lacks the isomorphism pro-

perty. On the other hand, one easily verifies that P’ is the free Abelian group generated by
b,c’, d’; and the groups which correspond to the G, are

Gi ={',c}, Gl={e',d}, Gy={d',b'},
; . ee ey MU Meee Hc

They intersect in pairs in

70 G = {c'}, 719 Gs = {b},

Gin G, tigi e iGoaiGe=and it

GoG=Cd} GyaGi—{db'}. One verifies at once that (Gin G;) 0! = Hyp,
that is to say, 0 has the strong (and thus also the weak) intersection property, and lacks only
the isomorphism property.
