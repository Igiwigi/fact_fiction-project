trisecant plane of ¢,, containing three chords of ¢,, and it must therefore meet ¢ in three
points. Thus ¢ is a quartic surface of the type [1, 3] on Q, i.e., a Veronese surface.t

Any prime of § meets ¢, in four points P, Q, R, 8; and to it there corresponds a
locus whose order is equal to that of the ®’-curves, i.¢., four. This locus V,* on Q
contains a double four{ of planes corresponding to the points and planes of the tetra-
hedron PQRS ; and since any prime of 8 meets every chord of ¢, V,* must contain
the surface $2. Hach such V3 is the intersection of Q with another quadric Q’ through
¢,*. For it is easy to calculate that there are three independent quadrics through the
first four planes of the double four on V,*, and these quadrics necessarily contain the
second four planes and meet V;* in just these eight planes. Hence there must be two
independent quadrics which contain V,‘ entirely, 7.e., 2 and one other, 2’, as stated.
It is known in fact, that there are ~* quadrics through a Veronese surface§ : and these
meet Q in the »* V5"’s corresponding to the primes of 8.

To the point P of § there corresponds some point P’ of 2; and we now project Q
from P’ on to a [4]. S then is in bi-rational correspondence with = ; and to quadrics
of ® there correspond prime sections of 2 which pass through P’ and project into
the primes of . The V,‘’s, being sections of 2 by quadrics, project into V,‘’s of &,
which have a common double quadric surface Q, and which all pass through ¢’,*, the
projection of the Veronese surface ¢,%. Generators of Q are projections of planes
of 2 through P’; and since these meet ¢:‘ in one or three points, $’.* must meet Q in
a curve of the type [1, 3], 7.c., a rational quartic. Thus the reverse system of primals ¥
consists of quartic primals having a double quadric surface Q and a projected Veronese
surface $',4 in common, where $',* meets Q in a rational quartic curve.
