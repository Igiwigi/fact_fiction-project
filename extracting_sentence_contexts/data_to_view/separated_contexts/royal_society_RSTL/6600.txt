The excess of Nitrogen in the produce has been absorbed as free gaseous Nitrogen. In regard to the explanation of the assimilation of free Nitrogen by plants, M. Vis
calls attention to the fact, that nascent hydrogen is said to give ammonia, and nascent
x nitric acid, with free Nitrogen; and he asksâ€”Why should not, the Nitrogen in
juices of the plant combine with the nascent carbon and oxygen in the leaves? He
her refers to the supposition of M. pr Luca, that the Nitrogen of the air combines
the nascent oxygen given off from the leaves of plants, and forms nitric acid. Again,
he juice of some plants (mushrooms) has been observed to ozonize the oxygen of the
; is it not probable, then, that the Nitrogen dissolved in the juices will submit to the
jon of the ozonized oxygen with which it is mixed, when we bear in mind that the
Wi contain alkalies, and penetrate tissues the porosity of which exceeds that of spongy
inum, a body 80 apt to favour combinations ?
