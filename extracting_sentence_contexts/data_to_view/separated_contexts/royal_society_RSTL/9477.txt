This formula may be written

and the expression on the right-hand side therefore corresponds to 4(Q+8) where
Q and $S are as defined in art. 3, 80 that the algebraic theorem to which the two forms
of Brssgr's Functions (58) and (60) lead is V=4(Q+8).

46. The formula involving descending series for BessgL's Function, J'(z) is

the descending series ultimately diverge for all values of » for which they do not
terminate, but the converging terms may be used for the calculation of J*(z); and this
formula was m fact employed by HAnsENn in the calculation of his tables of J*(z)
and J(@)*. If v=p+4, p being an integer, the series terminate and we obtain a
finite expression for J-+4(z). Replacing the sine and cosine by their exponential values, this formula may be
written

Ta)= ang i(—) "a+ o*B},
