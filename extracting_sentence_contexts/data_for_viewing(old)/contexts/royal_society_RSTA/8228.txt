formula.* The integral in (74) is rapidly convergent, the effective upper limit being
5or6. Since the values of @ and ¥ can be found only to 3 significant figures, the value
of P is unlikely to be correct to more than 2 figures, but this does not matter as, when
e exceeds 1, the contribution from P to %% is a small one. The values obtained were—

They lead to the last three entries in the first column of Table XV. This table reveals
the interesting fact that the tension on the axis tends to its limiting value more rapidly
than in a plate of great breadth.

Taste XV.—Stresses on the axis of a strip whose diameter is twice that of the hole
compared with those in very broad plate with the same size of hole.
