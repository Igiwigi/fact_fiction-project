navigation just as well as many other guidance strategies such
as parallel navigation. In fact, the dragonfly appears simply to
align its body to the prey flight direction and keep the target
within an approximately 50° cone directly overhead [96]. This
interception strategy simplifies the task to two-dimensional
tracking in the zenith direction and the dragonfly must only
increase its altitude to achieve interception.

Prior to prey pursuits, Plathemus lydia dragonflies often per-
form a rapid head movement to centre the target in its dorsal
fovea [103]. It was proposed that such head movement, together
with some thorax translation, produces sufficient motion paral-
lax for target distance estimation [103,107]. However, the fact
that some pursuits were not preceded by significant head move-
ment [103] and that the head movements produce little
translation means that parallax target ranging is questionable.
Instead, this head movement has a pure foveation function
and is triggered as the target enters a specific visual receptive
field (H-T. Lin 2013, unpublished data). Foveation is maintained
during pursuit flight [108] with minimal time lag (approx. 4 ms),
signifying the presence of predictive control [96]. Further ana-
lyses of the three-dimensional head orientation during pursuit
revealed that such predictive control cancels prey drifts owing
not just to the dragonfly’s in-flight body rotations, but also the
prey drift owing to relative translation. This suggests that the dra-
