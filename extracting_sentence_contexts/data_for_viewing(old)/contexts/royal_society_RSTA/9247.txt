Of the thermometers used, 11,048 gives the sharpest peak to the curve, while 4517
behaved very much more erratically than any of the others. 4304 shows a pronounced
double peak, but it is possible that this would have been eliminated by a more extended
series of observations : other thermometers showed a similar effect in the early stages of
the observations, but the trough filled up as the work proceeded. There is a smaller
effect of a similar type shown by 18,370. The other two curves, 16,377 and 11,151, may
be regarded as representative of the remainder which are not shown here. The
“ probable error” figures given in Table XI must, of course, be taken with reserve.
Tn order to find errors such that the chances are ten to one against their being exceeded,
the“ probable errors * must be multiplied by six, thus giving values of about + 0-004° C.

The form of the distribution curve and the fact that the arithmetic mean of the
observations is in fairly accurate coincidence with the peak of the curve give some
evidence that the number of observations was sufficient for the application of the
