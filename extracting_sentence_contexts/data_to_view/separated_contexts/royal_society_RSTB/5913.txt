J. P. HILL ON THE DEVELOPMENTAL HISTORY OF THE PRIMATES. 65

It might be held that these cells are the last remnants of former proliferative activity
on the part of the trophoblast, but the fact that they appear to be produced by the
division of a parent trophoblast cell tangentially to the surface, instead of radially
thereto, as is normal, suggests that they are to be regarded simply as the products of
accidental deviations from the normal mitotic plane. Apart from these cells, we have not observed in the development of the placenta of
Loris any structural feature which in the slightest degree suggests its derivation from a
more complicated type. Turning to the opposite view that the Lemuroid placenta is essentially primitive,
what evidence, apart from theoretical considerations, can we adduce in its support ?
