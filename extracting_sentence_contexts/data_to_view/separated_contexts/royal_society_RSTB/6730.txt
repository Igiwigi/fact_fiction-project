If for
some reason X* died out, then another strain, even if present in the smallest quantity,
would have a chance of overrunning the plant. At the other end of the series we have
found X” apparently unassociated with any other strain in all the otherwise healthy
Up-to-date plants examined. From experimental work we know that healthy potato plants infected with either
X#, X¢ or X* cannot in subsequent seasons be further infected by sap inoculation with
X° or X", These facts should inspire caution before invoking mutation within the tissues
of the potato as a general explanation of the mixed infections found in nature. It
would seem more probable that potato plants in the field suffering from an infection
with mixed strains had received such mixture either simultaneously, in a single

inoculation, or in two or more individual infections at short intervals of each other. Whatever the vector in nature is, it would seem to exert no selective action in the
process of infection, though it is not impossible that the plant may do so.
