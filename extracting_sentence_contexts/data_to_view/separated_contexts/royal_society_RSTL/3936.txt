They occur in 8mall patches in which the
branches are seen to be very numerous, and the anastomoses very frequent. The
epithelium is more abundant, and the cells large and of a dark colour, and the
injection does not run $0 readily as in the adult.

These facts appear to me to militate strongly against the notion of these ducts
being modified and anastomosing mucous glands, as TyziLE supposes. From their
arrangement it seems not improbable that they are really altered secreting tubes, and
at one time formed a part of the secreting structure of the liver. As the portal vein
increases in $ize at the termination of intra-uterine life, it is not nnreasonable to
suppose that some of the hepatic tissne close to it would be removed to some extent,
to make room for the enlarged vein; in such a case, many of the vessels would
degenerate into fibrous tissue, and the branched and anastomosing vasa aberrantia
would represent all that remains of the hepatic tubular network.
