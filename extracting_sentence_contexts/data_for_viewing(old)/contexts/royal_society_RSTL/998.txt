II. An Account of two Children born with Cataracts in their
Eyes, to shew that their Sight was obscured in very different
Degrees: with Experiments to determine the proportional
Knowledge of Objects acquired by them immediately after the
Cataracts were removed. By Everard Home, Esq. F. R.S.

Read January 15, 1807.

Ms. CurserLonx's observations on this subject, recorded in
the Phil. Trans. for the year 1728, pointed out two material
facts; that vision alone gives no idea of the figure of objects,
or their distance from the eye, since a very intelligent boy,
13 years of age, upon recovering his sight was unable to dis-
tinguish.the outline of any thing placed before him, and
thought that every object touched his eye.

Mr. Warz's cases, which have also a place in the Phil.
Trans. for 1801, and are compared with that of Mr. Cyz-
SELDEN, appear to lead to a different conclusion. The fol-
lowing observations are laid before the Society with a view
to explain this circumstance.
