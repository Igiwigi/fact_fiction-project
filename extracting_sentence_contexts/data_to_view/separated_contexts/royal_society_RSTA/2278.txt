Each single operation associated with an input x is represented by a quantum
instruments {Zp|x}a, namely a collection of completely positive maps, from the space of linear
operators into itself, that sum up to unital map for all x, ie. 7, Zajx(1) = 1. Notice that instruments
are defined in the Heisenberg picture, i.e. they transform the observables rather than the states. In fact, for a POVM {Ep}, we have the transformation Ey +> Zq\x(Ep), which must be still a POVM.
in a,b, ie. Yq Zajx(doy Ev) = oq Za\x(1) = 1. Here, the dimension plays the same role of the finite
number of perfectly distinguishable states in the classical model.
