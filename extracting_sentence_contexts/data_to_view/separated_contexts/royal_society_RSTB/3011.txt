This atrophy commences in
the follicles in closest proximity to the newly-formed corpus luteum and is continued in
the other follicles in ever widening circles. SaNnpEs suggests that the process is
brought about by mechanical pressure or is due to the internal secretion of the corpus
luteum, if it has one. Without in any way disputing the accuracy of the facts which Sanpxs describes,
we find it difficult to understand what advantage is gained by a mechanism having a
no more important object than that of securing the degeneration of the surplus ova

within the ovary instead of externally to it, nor do we see how, according to the
usually accepted doctrines of utility and natural selection, an organ having such a
function could ever have been developed at all. The theory that the corpus luteum is a “ ductless gland” having the function of
providing a secretion which aids in the attachment of the embryo to the uterine
mucosa, was first suggested by Gustav Born of Breslau, who persuaded Lupwia
FRAENKEL to put this view to an experimental test. For this purpose a series of
experiments upon Rabbits was undertaken (FRAENKEL and Coun, 1901, FRAENKEL,
1903), the ovaries being removed from one to six days after the occurrence ot
copulation, The animals were subsequently killed, when it was found that the
extirpation of the ovaries had prevented the fixation of the ova.
