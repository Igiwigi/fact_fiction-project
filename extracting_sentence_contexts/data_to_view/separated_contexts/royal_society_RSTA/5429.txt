In a more narrow sense, the term refers to either an entire property, e.g. of a corporation that is
applicable to the payment of debts or items on a balance sheet showing the book value of property

owned. The description of a technical system (e.g. a production system) of a company in terms of 7s
assets refers to the book value of the property owned and appears in the financial balance sheet of [3
the respective enterprise. If one extends the term to humans involved in the company’s operation, ar)
it is important to clearly define what is meant. :8

If one opts for the rather vague meaning of a simple ‘advantage’ or a ‘resource’, one misses 8
the fact that the human assets appear in a company’s balance sheet as cost factor only, pointing aN

more into the direction of ‘book value’ or ‘property owned’. Then the ‘book value’ of a human
is reduced to the financial value of her/his functioning correctly in the overall system. All the
intangible values of the respective human being, e.g. the ability to think associatively and thus
come to new solutions or to solve a difficult human situation at work, is not considered.
