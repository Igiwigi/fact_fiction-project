XII. 950 543, before XII. The explanation of the variations found in experiments 9, 11, 12 we take to be that
the pilocarpin did not bring about the normal increase in the blood flow through the
gland. In the absence of direct observations on the blood flow in these cases, we
cannot, of course, positively assert that the explanation we give is the true one, but
there are certain facts somewhat in favour of it. In Experiment 11, the rate of secretion of organic substance is rather faster in

II. than in I. :â€”

So that presumably the stimulus to the gland-cells either was a little stronger in II.
than in L., or the gland had increased in irritability ; but, since the rate of secretion
of water was rather slower in II., despite this, it is probable that the blood flow
through the gland was less in amount in II. In Experiment 9, the salts fall with the falling secretion, but less than normally ;
but, since the percentage of organic substance also falls less than normally, the cause
of the variation may be that the water is secreted less rapidly than corresponds with
the strength of stimulus and a full blood flow; that is to say, the percentage of salts
falls less than normally because the flow of blood through the gland falls more than
normally.
