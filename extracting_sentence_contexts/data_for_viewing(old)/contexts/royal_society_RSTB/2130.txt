g It is clear that there is a tendency to a gradual opening of the stomata in con-
gnued darkness, but more work is needed on the subject before any more detailed
wonclusions can be drawn. There is clearly the same irregularity of behaviour here
hat we have noted in regard to nocturnal closure of the stomata. Thus, Spar-
Mannia* did not open between January 22 and January 29, whereas, in November,
3396, it was well open after 29 hours’ darkness; this was also true of Cineraria
hich in January, 1897, had only begun to open after 48 hours ; similar differences
‘Gecur with Salvia in a less definite degree.
"8 What the meaning may be of the facts here given is not easy to say. The most
Sbvious analogy is that of nyctitropic plants, in which continuous darkness brings the
‘eaves into a fixed position which resembles rather the day than the night position.
he existence of some degree of periodicity in the diurnal variation of the stomata
@nds probability to this view. In itself it is not an explanation of the fact, since we
Flo not know what is the cause of the analogous behaviour of sleeping leaves. It is,
owever, a classification of the fact that seems to me more satisfactory than the quasi-
anechanical treatment which is often applied to the stoma problem.
& It may, however, be better to look at the problem in a more simple and direct manner,
As Leirces has done. Het has called attention to the variable result which follows pro-
gonged darkness. The case of Viola lutea, described by him, seems to resemble my
esults, inasmuch as the stomata gradually opened during several days. Lerraxs is
Anclined to explain the result (without much reason, I think) to the continued effect of a
