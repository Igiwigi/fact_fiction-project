In two other instances we found
this to hold good after the lapse of periods of twelve minutes and twenty minutes
after the stop. Our attempts therefore, so far as we went, to obtain indirect evidence of lactic acid
production on Pike’s Peak gave negative results up to the pace of four miles an hour. Coupled with the fact that the alteration of the respiratory quotient was quite evident
when walking at two miles an hour and was not influenced by the duration of the exer-
tion, this throws us back for an explanation on an alteration of the metabolism, which
would mean that during the exercise a larger proportion of carbohydrate was utilised
than in the resting period. We make this suggestion with some diffidence as it is contrary to the accepted
view, for the great majority at least of the previous observations have shown that the
relative proportions of carbohydrate and fat consumed remain the same during work
and rest.* Very likely a longer duration of the exercise than in our experiments would
have given a lower value of the respiratory quotient, for if carbohydrate is being
more readily used than fat, prolongation of the exercise must lead to a diminution of
the amount of carbohydrate available.
