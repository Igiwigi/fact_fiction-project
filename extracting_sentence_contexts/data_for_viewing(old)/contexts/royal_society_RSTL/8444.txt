occurrence at such a depth, some doubt may be entertained whether it was originally
lodged at the level from which it was removed. 2. The second exception is also a portion
of a cannonbone which has been split down the middle on each side, and has been much
gnawed at either end, apparently by the Hyzna. The bone is of much the s8ame size 2
the preceding, and it is in the same condition in other respects, or perhaps rather more:
mineralized. It was found at a depth of 4 feet in the third bed, together with two:
flint fragments (implements 1). 3. The third deep-seated specimen is a doubtful frag-
ment of a humerus.

The specimens met with near or on the surface of the third bed consist of:â€”(1) A
small fragment of a large metatarsal. (2) The third and fourth cervical vertebre, of
which the bone is of a light colour, with scarcely a trace of dendritic deposit, and
covered with a thin layer of crystalline stalagmite. These two vertebre, in fact, are in
precisely the same condition as the Horse's jaw described above. They are both stated
to have been found at a depth of 3 inches in the third bed, and at a distance of 85 feet
from the entrance, although from their aspect it would seem likely that they should
have been nearer the surface and in contact with the stalagmite. (3) A portion of
the left maxilla with four molar teeth #2 8it4. This specimen was found, as it. would
8eem, on the surface of the third bed; but it presents no trace of calcareous deposit, and
the condition of the bone and teeth, as respects colour and mineral impregnation,
exactly resembles that of the two cannonbones above described.

This specimen is worthy of special regard. It is probably the jaw of a rather young!
animal, inasmuch as the two premolars which remain are very little worn. - The species
appears to have been about the size of the common Ox. The length of the series of two
