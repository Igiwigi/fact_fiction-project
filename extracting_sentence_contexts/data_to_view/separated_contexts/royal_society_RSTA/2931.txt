Had we used ginf instead of &gm for
the initialization of the LPT, we would have obtained exactly that result of a prefactor of 3. This
means that, in [49], in essence the infimum for the Hamiltonian was used for initialization of ICs,
instead of the RM Hamiltonian. It was possible there not to remain on the RM for the derivation
of the critical coupling due to the fact that the critical coupling prefactor there did not depend on
N. Thus, there is no jump at the limit of vanishing foundation, but rather a different choice of
the initial point dictated by the dependence on N. However, had we not used a generalization
of the underlying conditions of an LPT, and simply taken fi, =0, by analogy with what was
done in [49], the numeric prefactor for the critical coupling would have been 3 = 0.4286, which
is relatively quite far both from the value of 3 of the case of no foundation per se and the result
given in equation (6.12).
