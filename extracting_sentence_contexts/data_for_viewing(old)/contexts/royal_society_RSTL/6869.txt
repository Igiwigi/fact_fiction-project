3. Action of Nascent Hydrogen.â€”When an aqueous lution of opianic acid is warmed
for seyeral hours with sodium-amalgam, the subsequent addition of hydrochloric acid
causes a precipitate of meconin. The formation of meconin is not due, in this case, to'
the decomposition of the opianic acid by the soda formed from the sodium-amalgam ; for
it takes place in a dilute solution, and at a temperature yery much below that at which
opianic acid is decomposed under the influence of alkali; the quantity of meconin
formed from a given weight of acid is also considerably greater than that produced
under the latter circumstances; for instance, 5 grms. opianic acid gave 3:65 grms, pure
meconin, whereas 5 grms. opianic acid decomposed by: alkali would yield 2:3 grms.
meconin and 2-7 grms. hemipinic acid. 'The barely possible supposition that the addi-
tional quantity of meconin is owing to the reduction of hemipinic acid formed in a
previous stage of the reaction is excluded by the fact that hemipinic acid is not acted on
by sodium-amalgam in presence of water, Moreoyer opianic acid is similarly converted
into meconin by the action of zinc and dilute swlphuric acid. Hence the transforma-
tion consists in a direct reduction or deoxidation of the acid under the influence of
nascent hydrogen.

According to this equation, 5 parts of opianic acid correspond to 4-6 parts of meconin.

Of the two following analyses, the firs was made with the product of the action of
sodium-amalgam, the second with that of the action of zinc and dilute sulphuric acid on
opianic acid; this latter product retained a slight colour, even after being several times
