We are indebted to Dr L. H. Aller for this information and for sending us the results of the calculations
on O* and N* (see table 10a, footnote) before publication. t The fact that the most serious failure occurs with neon (which occupies a central position in the group
studied) is of course in no way contradictory since s- and p-shell systems are not strictly comparable; and
furthermore the difference in the representation of the ejected electron (see above) may introduce com-
plications. 18-2
