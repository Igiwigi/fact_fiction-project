If the irregularities in the angular spectrum are so widely spaced that they are separated
by an angle much greater than Js, as indicated in figure 1, then the ‘running mean’ over As
will, to some extent, repeat the irregularities of P(s) without much smoothing. These con-
ditions will hold when there is some considerable degree of correlation in the angular spec-
trum so that p,(4s) is not much different from unity. The fact that there is considerable
correlation in the angular spectrum implies that the stop is not too large. Next consider what happens as the optical ‘stop’ is made wider. The irregularities in
P(s) will assume a finer structure, corresponding to the increasing fineness of the diffraction
pattern of the ‘stop’ itself.
