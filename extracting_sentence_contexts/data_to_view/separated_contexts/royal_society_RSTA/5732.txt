I shall call this portion of the
multiverses presented in equation (3.59) the ‘tail’ of that four-dimensional multiverse. Note that
this tail is actually a four-dimensional open submanifold of each multiverse. The fact that all of
the multiverses have the same tail, is the key to the construction of the megamultiverse. But before
I do that I would like to say a few words about time travel. Say we are given two points (t1, pi) and (t2, p2) in T(Dp), where tz > t) > 0.
