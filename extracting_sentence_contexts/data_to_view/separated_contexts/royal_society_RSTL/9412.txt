For now, in conclusion, I may observe that
in order to render the experimental parallel complete, T imitated in the case of chemical
stimulation the proof of the fact which I have just narrated in the case of electrical
stimulation, viz. : that the artificial rhythm depends on the continuous reception by the
excitable tissues of a stimulus which is continuously supplied from a seat, or seats, of
injury. The method which T employed to prove this fact in the case of chemical
stimulation was as follows. Having slit open the paralyzed bell of Sarsia along the
whole of one side from base to apex of the cone, I suspended the now sheet-like mass
of tissue by one corner in the air, leaving the rest of the sheet to hang vertically
downwards. By means of a rack-work support I now lowered the sheet of tissue till
one portion of it dipped into a beaker filled with a solution of glycerine of appropriate
strength.
