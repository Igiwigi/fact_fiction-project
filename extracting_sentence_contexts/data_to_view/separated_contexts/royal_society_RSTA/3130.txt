A flower border used to run the whole length of the west wall, containing shrubs
3 or 4 feet high. The northern half of this border was cleared of shrubs and laid
down in grass, which has been kept short the whole year round. These changes were
made with the object of securing that no appreciable fictitious element should be
introduced into the annual change of potential gradient. A definite test of the insulation of the apparatus was introduced, and is applied
each morning. It is not always possible to improve defective insulation immediately
when discovered, but at the worst the test shows when a dayâ€™s record is to be
regarded with suspicion.
