Tt was found moreover that, whenever two liquids under-
went @ change of position of this kind, the vapours of the liquids underwent a similar
change; in its finest gradations, the deportment of the liquid was imitated by that of
its vapour. F 12. And here we find ourselves in a position to offer solutions of various facts which have
hitherto stood as enigmas in researches upon radiant heat. It was for a time generally
$upposed that the power of heat to penetrate diathermic substances augmented as the
temperature of the source of heat became more eleyated. KNoBLAUCH contended against
this notion, showing that the heat emitted by a platinum wire plunged into an alcohol
flame was less absorbed by certain diathermic screens than the heat of the flame itself,
and justly arguing that the temperature of the spiral could not be higher than that of
the body from which it derived its heat.
