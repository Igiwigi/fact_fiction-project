But that result is puzzling: clearly, as our analysis above has shown, there are
scenarios where such an assertion seems neither false nor unduly prolix. The prefix ‘it is the
whole truth that’ does not seem to be redundant in the way that ‘it is true’ has been taken
to be. In Tractatus 1.1.1, Wittgenstein writes: “The world is determined by the facts, and by their

being all the facts. In recent years, philosophers have aimed to give a more precise meaning
to this ‘quantifier over everything’. This has involved efforts in metaphysics [65,66] and also
crucially for us, ethics and the law [67,68].
