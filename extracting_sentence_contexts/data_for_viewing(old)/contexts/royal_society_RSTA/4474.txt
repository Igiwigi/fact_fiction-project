call here inconsistent connectedness (or violations of marginal selectivity), and it should not be
confused with the meaning of contextuality as defined in §§1 and 2 and indicated by the sign
of AC.

4. Schréder’s staircase illusion (a cyclic system of rank 3)

Asano et al. [29] studied a cyclic system of rank 3, using as ‘objects’ q1, 42,43 Schréder’s staircases
tilted at three different angles, @ = 40°, 45°,50°, as shown in figure 1. In fact, these three angles
formed the middle part of a set of 11 angles ranging from 0° to 90° and presented either in the
descending order (context c,), or in the ascending order (context cz), or else in a random order
(context cz). Each context involved a separate set of about 50 participants, and each participant
in response to each of 11 angles had to indicate whether she/he sees the surface A in front of
B (+1) or B in front of A (—1). From these 11 responses, in each context, the authors selected
two. In context ci, the selected responses were those to @ =40°,45°, so, formally, cy can be
identified with (q1,q2); in contexts cz and c3 the selected responses were those to @ = 45°, 50°
and to @ =50°,40°, respectively, making cz = (q2,q3) and c3 = (q3,q1). It is irrelevant to the logic
of the analysis that each context in fact contained all three tilts q1,q2,q3, as well as eight other
tilts. (Reference [29] includes a variety of other combinations of three objects and three contexts
extracted from the experiment in question. The dataset for the combination described here was
kindly made available to us by Asano et al. [29].)
