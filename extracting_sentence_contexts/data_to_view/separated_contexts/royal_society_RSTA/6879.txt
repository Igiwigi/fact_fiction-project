Consider the mesh of figure 14, on the curved boundary of which the function w and its
derivatives dw/dx, dw/dy are specified at every point. If the differential equation were of
the second order (with only one boundary condition to satisfy), finite-difference equations
would be set up at all internal points, external (fictitious) points being eliminated. The
finite-difference form of the biharmonic equation, however, involves more pivotal points,
and in particular its satisfaction at internal points adjacent to the boundary would involve
the elimination of many fictitious points, at least one of which is more than one mesh length
distant from the boundary. Ficure 14

Fox & Southwell (1941) therefore proposed to satisfy the differential equation only at
those internal points, marked with a cross in figure 14, which involve only those fictitious
points, marked with an open circle, less than one mesh length outside the boundary. The
other internal points, marked with a closed circle, would be obtained by means of the
boundary conditions; they might then by analogy be called internal fictitious points.
