The
film was again removed with acid, and this time the disc was drastically cleaned by
the method of Harpy and Doustepay (loc. cit. in 1) and afterwards heated in vacuo
for 4 hours at 550Â° C, which should remove any water vapour. With subsequent
sputtering and heating the pattern was once more repeated. The fact that drastic
cleansing leaves a pattern of lines unaltered was observed at many different parts of
the surface, with all three silver films, and was as definite in most, if not all, cases
as in the one instance shown in the photographs. The feature of quartz glass
