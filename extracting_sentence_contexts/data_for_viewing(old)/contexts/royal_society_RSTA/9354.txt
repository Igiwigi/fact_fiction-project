more correctly represented in the manner shown by the broken line in the diagram
in fig. 6 than by a gradually sloping line. The lower yield stress is seen to remain
constant over a range of strain several times as great as the previous elastic strain.
Tt will further be seen that when the load is removed and re-applied during this range,
flow again continues at the lower yield stress.

Table IT shows that the mean value of the initial yield stress is greater in the longi-
tudinal direction than in the transverse direction, for each material. The lower yield
stress also, except in the case of steel A, is greater in the longitudinal direction and,
in the case of steel B, by approximately the same amount. Steel A appears in fact to
be more uniform in properties in the two directions that either B or C. The amount
