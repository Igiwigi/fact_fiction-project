small terms in the expression for the lost energy, which it would be very troublesome
to evaluate.

The term (e—s) Z represents the mutual energy of the departure from sphericity
of e with the layer of surface density Zon £, This term is clearly very small and
will be omitted. Similarly (#—S)/ will be neglected. It will appear from the
results below that these terms are at least of the seventh order in powers-of 1/r.
A fortiori LL, which is at least of the eighth order, will be omitted.

The whole expression for V will now be divided into several portions.

Let (e#), be that portion of e# in which each ellipsoid may be replaced by a
particle ; it is, in fact, the product of the masses of e and £ divided by 7,

Let (e#), be the rest of eH.

Let (vv) denote that portion of V in which the larger body £ may be replaced by a
sphere ; then

(vv) = gee+hll+[e+ 8,4 $0* (y?+2*)] 14+ 80.

Similarly, let

(VV) = $BE+4004+[E4+s,4+40?(¥?+Z’)| L+s,L.
