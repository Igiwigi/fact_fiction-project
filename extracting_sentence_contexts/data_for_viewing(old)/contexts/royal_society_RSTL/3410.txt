Town, and that Mr. G. Txomesow sent a piece of one to England.

I consider I am justified in the opinion that but a small proportion of the whole

but unseen at the time of explosion. I may also remark, that beyond Dx Torr's
house for a considerable distance in the direction of the line of flight, there is nothing
but rugged mountain, without, I believe, inhabitants.
