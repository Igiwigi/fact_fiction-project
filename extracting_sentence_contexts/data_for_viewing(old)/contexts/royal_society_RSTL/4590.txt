T HAD for a long while entertained the idea that among the fossil remains collected
from the Wealden deposits of the South-East of England, there were indications of an
enormous Lizard entirely distinct from the Iguanodon, Megalosaurus, Cetiosaurus,
and other genera which have been named and more or less accurately determined ;
and I have at length obtained such evidence in support of my opinion, as induces me
to submit to the Royal Society the data which appear to establish the existence of a
terrestrial reptile contemporary with the Iguanodon, and which equalled, if not sur-
passed in magnitude, that colossal herbivorous Saurian.

I shall not on the present occasion enter upon those minute anatomical details
which are indispensable for the solution of many of the difficult problems which but
too often perplex and bewilder the palzontologist, but content myself with faithful
descriptions and figures of snch facts as will suffice to establish my proposition ; in
the hope that these guesses at truth, which recent investigations have suggested to
my mind, may serve to direct future labourers in the right path of inquiry, and tend
to enlarge our knowledge of that remarkable fauna which prevailed in the islands and
continents of the Cretaceous, Wealden, and Oolitic ages.

The occurrence of very large isolated vertebra, and portions of femora with medul-
lary cavities, indicating animals of terrestrial habits, and of great size, and which,
though assigned to the Cetiosaurus, could not properly be included in a genus of
aquatic marine reptiles with solid bones like the Cetaceans, first suggested to me
the probability of there having existed another genus of Saurians contemporary with
those previously mentioned, and to which some of the supposed Cetiosaurian remains
might belong. This idea, though vague, seemed to offer an explanation of certain
