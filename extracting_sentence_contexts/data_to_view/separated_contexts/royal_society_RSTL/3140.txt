Some years before the publication of the Principia, it had been ascertained by
observation that the same mass of matter has not the same weight at all the points
of the earth's surface. A pendulum clock regulated by mean time at Paris was found
by M. Ricnes to lose two minutes a day at Cayenne, within 5* of the equator. Now
the length of a pendulum that oscillates in a given time is an exact measure of gravity;
and the fact observed by M. Rricnzs proved that, if a heavy body were carried from
Paris to Cayenne, it would lose some part of its weight. On learning this fact,
HuvyGnexs conjectured that it was caused by the centrifugal force arising from the
daily revolution of the earth ; the intensity of this force varying in different latitudes
at different distances from the axis of rotation. Combining this obseryed variation
of gravity with a principle, which is indisputably true, namely, that a plumb-line
freely snspended is perpendicular to the surface of standing water, or to the surface
of the earth supposed entirely fluid, he drew an argument, that the earth is not ex-
actly spherical.
