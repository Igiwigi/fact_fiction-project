of the rotary motion of the input solitons in this setting. We have found that, for a fixed value of
amplitude Ro of the refractive-index modulation profile, the maximum tangential kick strength,
Mmax, decreases with the increase of amplitude Lo of the loss-modulation profile, as shown in
figure 4a. In addition, we have found that, for fixed amplitude Lp, Mmax increases with the
increase of Ro, as shown in figure 4b. However, in the case of stable evolution, M < Mmax, the
input soliton cannot display persistent rotary motion. In fact, it performs a circular motion only
at an initial stage of the propagation, subsequently transforming into a stationary stable state.
A typical example of this evolution scenario is shown in figure 4c. Obviously, this scenario is
drastically different from those described above, when we considered lattices with sole refractive
index or loss modulation. Finally, in figure 4d, we show a typical example of unstable evolution,
leading to decay of the soliton.
