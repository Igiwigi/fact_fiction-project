It is unusual in that
all its megaspore membranes are of small size, well under 1 mm. long. Below some, and
perhaps all, of the megaspores there is a small dark nodule very like the pollen masses of
the specimen called Microcheiris. Accordingly, it was removed and further macerated, and
it was proved that each was in fact a pollen mass. One of these masses teased out
from the capsule is shown in figure 24, plate 19, and in figure 4B; the others are
similar or a little larger, but the pollen grains composing these masses are so numerous
and so compacted together that it is not possible to trace the outline of any one of them
completely. The innermost layer of the capsule which is called the fibrous membrane proved trouble-
some to investigate and is by no means understood.
