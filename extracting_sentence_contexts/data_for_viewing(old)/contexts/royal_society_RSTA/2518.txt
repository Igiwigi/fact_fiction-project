Formal proofs should be viewed as representatives of ordinary mathematical proofs only when they
preserve leading ideas and have been constructed in a strategic way relative to a methodological
framework. Of course, the character of this intricate connection is itself a central topic of
investigation.

Appendix A

Here is the list of lemmas that are actually used in the top-level proof of the Cantor-Bernstein
Theorem. For a full list of lemmas used in the proof of the CBT, see ([8], appendix A). One
should note the directness of the first five observations; the remaining ones are facts concerning
Dedekind’s chains and are used in the proof of the structural identity.

"This technique is reminiscent of the Greek way of partitioning geometric figures and showing them to be congruent by
arguing for the congruence of the parts; such Zerlegungsbeweise are the topic of Mahlo’s thesis [9]. Its most famous application
is found in Euclid’s proof of the Pythagoras’ theorem; see my [31].
