Nevertheless, the study clarifies the structural functions of the collagen links and the
suggestions drawn from the results can be used to improve existent models of the cornea. In
the limits of approximation offered by the present model, the suggestion that we obtain from this
study is that from the structural point of view the keratoconus is the result of the weakening of
intra-fibrillar bonds. The numerous simplifying assumptions used in the creation of the trusswork
rule out any predictive capacity of the model, that cannot be used directly for quantitative
estimates.


In particular, the collagen structure here presented fully disregards the elastin and
proteoglycan matrix, and therefore it fails to be representative of the actual behaviour
of the stroma. As a matter of fact, the collagen structure is immersed in a deformable
medium and connected to it by chemical bonds that allow the interaction between fibrils and
matrix.

In the view of the creation of a predictive model of the human stroma, the collagen structure
should be connected to the elastic matrix by classical methods of computational mechanics;
for example, (i) adopting homogenization techniques, where the structure is embedded into
a homogenized material that preserves the features of the microstructure, making use of
generalized tensors or pseudo-invariants [26]; or (ii) using superposition techniques where
structural and continuum elements are combined as it is done in modelling steel bars in
reinforced concrete. A more challenging task is the direct inclusion of the collagen structure in
micromechanical models of the cornea, which opens the possibility to account for other physics
to describe the material degradation and explain the weakening of the bond stiffness [39]. In this
