e two, when the muscle is exposed at the surface of the body ; thus seen, the extre-
mity has somewhat the shape of a battledoor; and the pair meeting behind almost
ely enclose the occlusors and the terminal extremity of the intestine. Though thus
Itered and combined into one, the function of this single pair of muscles will be exactly
the same as when divided into two, as the areas of attachment are not materially changed.
[t will, in fact, open the valves and at the same time protrude the peduncle ; but on
ccount of the combination, the two actions may perhaps be rendered more harmo-

Water and more important abadontios obtains in W. cranium and T. caput-ser-
is). In these two species the dorsal adjustor muscles are not attached to a hinge-
Kato, as in W. Australis, but have their insertions in the valve itself, and are very large
nd powerful. In both species the superior extremities of these muscles are seen at the
- Surface of the animal, on each side of the median line, elongated in the antero-posterior
: direction, and extending between the occlusors almost as far forward as their anterior
argins. They are enlarged posteriorly, particularly in T. caput-serpentis, in which they
2are of an irregular form.

The divaricators and the accessory divaricators in W. eranium? are likewise united in
