An example of the communities detected with LPA is shown in figure 1, where nodes with
the same colour belong to the same community. Notice that the algorithm is not provided with
any knowledge of the spatial relation among the nodes. In fact, it is completely model-agnostic,
in the sense that it is designed to work on arbitrary weighted graphs that may represent any sort

Figure 5. Community structure of concurrence networks. (a) Number of communities in the concurrence network over N, n/N, —
as a function of k/N, for V = 100, 200, 500, 600, 960, by treating the edges as unweighted (blue) and weighted (green). In the {a
weighted case, the number of detected communities is exactly equal to k (with some fluctuations due to numerical errors), :2
regardless of NV.
