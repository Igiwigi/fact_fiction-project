Ov the other hand, there is » large body of experimental evidence for the belief
thot the air bladder has an important, though secondary, relation to respiration by
wehiig os u reservoir for jhe superabandance of oxygen which is taken into the blood
through the gills, and subsequently re-absorbed from the wir-bladder into the blood
when the Fish is in water containing but little of that gus in solution It seems
lear, névertheless, that, however important this secondary relation of the au-bladder
to respiration may be in Fishes in general, there van be no physiological conection
between it and the Weberian mechanism. The function of the air-bladder as aa
oxygen veservoir is, to say the least, as characteristic of those Wishes in which a
Weberian invchanism is absent, as if is of those in which it is present. In fact,
Morgan's researches go much firther than this, and prove to the point of actual
demonstration that of the Fishes with which he experimented those provided with a
Weberian mechanism had relatively but little expucity for absorbing oxygen fiom the
ai-bladder, when placed under conditions likely to cause asphyxia, 4, in water
deprived of its oxyyen, whereas mauy otber Fishes belonging both to the Physoclist
ind Dhysostome divisions of the Teleostei, in which the Webevian apparatus is
wating, had a far greater capacity for absorbing oxygen under similar conditions
than the former. Morpav has also shown that a marked capacity for oxygen absorp-
tion is ulways associated with the presence of retia mirabilia in the walls of the air-
Tladder, and these structures, as we have already pointed out, ave invariably absent
in all Siluridm, and, so furas we are acquainted, in all the remaining Ostariophyses.
