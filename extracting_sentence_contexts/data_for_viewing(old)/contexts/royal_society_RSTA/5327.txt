believe should be a correction of —6 ppm with an uncertainty of 6 ppm; and

— an unnecessary correction of +8 ppm included in the calculation for G in both servo and
Cavendish methods for an offset in the alignment of the source masses which should
not exist because the alignment procedure eliminates such a misalignment. In addition,
more accurately represented thermal effects in the dimensional metrology decreased the
correlation coefficient from —0.58 to —0.63; this has reduced the uncertainty on the final
value of G from 27 to 25 ppm.

2B. Final remarks

In our 2013 paper, we remark that the value then given and that published in 2001 are statistically
independent and that they are also statistically consistent. We also referred to the fact that each is
based on the average of two largely independent methods, the servo and the Cavendish. At the
start of this paper, in describing our method we said: in an experiment in which there are two or more
independent methods, one has first to look for errors in each until they all agree. When this is the case, the
only errors that can remain are those in the much more limited set common to all. We note again that in
our experiments the servo method relies essentially on electrical and angle measurements while
the Cavendish relies on timing and angle measurements, but that the same relative error in angle
measurement produces equal but opposite effects in the two methods and is thus eliminated
in the average of the two. Thus, it seems evident that if the servo and Cavendish results agree
within their own uncertainties, this is strong evidence that unknown errors in electrical, angle
and timing must be at or below the level of these uncertainties. The experiment will still, however,
be subjected to unknown errors in other measured quantities that are common to both servo and
Cavendish methods, notably in our case, dimensional metrology and source mass properties. But,
