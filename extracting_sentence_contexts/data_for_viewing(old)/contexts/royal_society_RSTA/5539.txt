where nR and hk are the right and left limits of the spectrum; the right component of Wss
WSs = hf — HX, (2.8)

with h?** the Hélder’s exponent of the maximum of the singularity spectrum, and the left
component of Weg
Weg = HP — hi. (29)

If the singularity spectrum is concave with a continuous first derivative, then its maximum occurs
at q=0. In fact, substituting the definition of /j in equation (2.5) into equation (2.6), one obtains

and calculating the derivative versus q

dq dq?
Thus dD(q)/dq=0 for q=0, which corresponds to the maximum because D(q) is concave. In
practice, a(q) is estimated over a finite number of moment orders q spaced by Aq increments and
thus, the evaluated D(q) maximum is influenced by the Aq amplitude and the finite-difference
method used to calculate the derivative of the mass exponent. If the whole singularity spectrum
