Further, it was the external parathyroids in
the experiments of Vincent and Jonny which, after removal of the thyroid, became
converted into a tissue resembling the latter. So that, although some authors have
been inclined to look upon external and internal parathyroids as separate and distinct
organs, the present series of observations does not lend any support to the view that
either one is less intimately connected with the thyroid than the other.

_The nature of this relationship is, however, by no means clear. As stated above,
the facts of embryology cannot be ignored. It seems to be well ascertained that the
parathyroids are developed from the epithelium of the third and fourth gill-clefts,
while the thyroid is derived from the median rudiment on the ventral wall of the
embryonic pharynx. Moreover, the two structures do not arise at the same time, and
many embryologists believe that parathyroids only secondarily enter into relation
with the thyroid.
