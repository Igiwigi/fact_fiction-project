Tax present Series of these Researches is divided into two parts: in the first I propose to
treat of the development of heat, electricity, and vis viva, by the muscle in a state of
contraction ; in the second, of the chemical changes produced by the muscle in contrac-
tion on the air.

PART THE FIRST.

I 1. That the temperature of an animal is raised by muscular exercise, is a fact gene-
rally admitted and proved by common experience. M. BECQUEREL having introduced
the point of a thermo-electric pile into a muscle of the human body, found an increase
of temperature during contraction which amounted to a degree Centigrade : Mr. NewPorT
also discovered a remarkable increase in the temperature of insects while in movement.
M. BxcqueRtL attributed this increase of temperature in muscles during contraction to
the greater activity of sanguineous circulation which apparently takes place in a muscle
in that state. In support of this interpretation, M. BEcqQUEREL 8howed, that, by com-
pressing one of the large arteries distributed in a muscle under experiment, an immediate
decrease of temperature takes place in that muscle. M. BERNARD discovered an increase
of heat in one of the ears of a rabbit or dog after having cut the cervical ganglion con-
nected with the nervous filament of that ear: this remarkable fact is also associated in
80me unknown manner, depending on the peculiar action of the ganglionic system, with
