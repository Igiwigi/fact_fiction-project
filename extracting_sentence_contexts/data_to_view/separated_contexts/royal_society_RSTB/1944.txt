This consideration appears to me to lessen the force
of the objection, which has been raised to the use of the phenomena of apogamy and
apospory for phylogenetic purposes, that they are as yet unknown in such groups as
the Lycopodinez:.§

The Ferns appear in some respects the best suited of the Vascular Cryptogams for
the attempt to obtain experimental evidence on the nature of alternation of genera-
tions. If the gametophyte and the sporophyte are to be traced back to originally
similar stages of a primitive organism, it is evident that the sexual plant has diverged
less widely from the latter than the sporophyte has. Among the Vascular Cryptogams
