It is finally worth noting that the above methodology allows us to recover the behaviour of
monatomic gases (C, = D/2) with a Prandtl number fixed to Pr=1. The former limitation can
be overcome through the use of a second population [52], while the latter problem is usually
corrected by changing the collision model [53,54].


(b) From discrete velocity models to lattice Boltzmann method

A common, deterministic and efficient way to solve the (force-free) BGK-BE

inf + dala) = =F f°), 28)

is to rely on a discretization of the velocity space, which leads to the discrete velocity Boltzmann
equation (DVBE) based on the BGK operator [37]

Vie{1,...,V), difi + dalfia) = ~ 26 — 3). (2.9)

If the above velocity discretization is done in such a way that the matching conditions between
discrete and continuous moments

> fe Tev Eg EL = Mae (2.10)

are satisfied up to the order p+q+r=n, then the macroscopic behaviour of interest is
automatically satisfied up to the same order n [2,14]. In fact, there are several ways to enforce
them. The most popular ones rely on the maximum entropy principle (MEP), the moment-
matching approach or the (Gauss-Hermite) quadrature-based methodology. For the latter two
approaches, strict conditions must be satisfied by the velocity discretization in order to obtain an
analytical formulation of the discrete equilibrium. f. ‘4 [3-5].
