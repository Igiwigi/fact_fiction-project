(19144, 19146) and with Kato (19144, 19146) concluded that no differentiation, either
structural or functional, between purely contractile and purely conducting muscular
tissue, occurs in lower vertebrate hearts, or in those of birds. Skramlik (1921, 1932)
found that in the frog and toad the muscle fibres, apart from slight variation in size,
have the same histological characters in all parts of the heart, and attributed the delay
in the passage of the impulse across the junctional sites to the arrangement, rather
than any specialization, of the junctional muscle.

In marked contrast with all of the investigators so far quoted, Dogiel and Archangelsky
(1906), Dogiel (1907, 1910) and Imchanitzky (1908, 1909) failed to find in the frog,
lizard and tortoise any muscular connexion whatever between the atria and ventricle,
and maintain that the connexion between these chambers is purely a nervous one.
In fact, Dogiel (1907) attributed the results of other workers, who found such muscular
continuity, to the artificial dragging of muscle fibres across the A-V junction during
the actual process of cutting the sections.

The foregoing survey has been mainly confined to the morphological aspect of the
question, but there still remain a number of purely experimental investigations to be
discussed. Omitting from the present discussion the numerous experiments designed
purely to determine whether the origin and conduction of the cardiac impulse are
neurogenic or myogenic, there are others which suggest the existence of specialized
muscle in various parts of the heart. ‘Thus Engelmann (1895, 1897) found that the
speed of conduction of the impulse across the A-V junction of the frog’s heart is much
slower than that in the general atrial wall and attributed this to the muscle of embryonal
type described by Gaskell and by His at the junctional sites of the heart. Garrey
