in excess or deficiency of the
mean, and it is quite possible that such exceptional cases are due to purely chance
errors and are not inherent in the method itself, as there is opportunity for them to
occur since the experiments are somewhat prolonged and involve a considerable
number of separate observations. ‘The true experimental error of the method is bound
in any case to be considerable, for the error of the carmine titration sums with those
of the measurement and analysis of the carbon monoxide.t As was pointed out
by Haupane and Lorrain Suir, the carbon monoxide must certainly unite with
any hemoglobin in the muscles, &c., as well as with that in the blood, and though we
give the value for the total oxygen capacity and calculate the blood volume from it as
if all the hemoglobin were in the blood, this fact should be remembered. All the
figures for the blood volume are therefore too high by an unknown, though probably
not very large, proportion, owing to the inability of the carbon monoxide method to
discriminate between the heemoglobin within and outside the circulation—in the case
of normal rabbits Boycorr and Dovenas found that the hemoglobin left in the
muscles, bone marrow, &e., after washing out the blood-vessels as thoroughly as
possible, was about 7 per cent. of the total amount of hemoglobin in the body.
