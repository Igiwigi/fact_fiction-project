306 DR. HASSALL ON THE FREQUENT PRESENCE

Since, however, normal urine-pigment very closely resembles hazmatin in its compo-
Sition, it is probable that in some cases indigo is formed from this pigment, altered
or modified by disease.

Professor SCHERER® long since directed attention to the fact, that there is a close
relation between the elementary composition of hazmatin and the several colouring
matters of bile and urine, and he even hazards a conjecture that the two latter may
be derived from the former. If we view the per-centage composition of all these
£1 bstances side by side, the following is the aspect they present :—

Ry nes ; on Blue pigment | Brown pigment | Brown pigment
White indigo | Hematin | Bile-pigment Pig! On a
(Cron). | (Muros). | (Scnxrzs). | , Of urine in disease. in health
(Scnxres). (Scnxrss). (Scare).
