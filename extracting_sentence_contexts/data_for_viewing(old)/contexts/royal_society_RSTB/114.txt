in the open. As regards the generalisation that the tubercles are commoner in soils
which are poor in nitrogenous substances, this might be because there is more oxygen
supplied to the very large active root-systems in such soils ; a view, moreover, which
is in accordance with the well-known fact that the tubercles are apt to be more
abundant and larger on those parts of the roots which are nearer the surface of the
soil, though this is not necessarily the case. There is another point to note here.
Tscurrcu himself observes (p. 90) that the Leguminosx are deep-rooted plants which
do not thrive well in rich humus-soils, abounding in nitrogenous materials. Now,
without agreeing with him to the extent of his generalisations (for it is by no means
established that the Leguminosr as a class are dependent on one kind of soil), it is
obvious that nothing in this contradicts the explanation of the tubercles as hyper-
trophies due to the stimulating action of a symbiotic Fungus. Tscutrcu lays great
stress on the facts that the analysis of the tubercles shows them to be relatively very
rich in potassium, phosphorus, and nitrogen, and claims that the abundance of nitrogen
is due to the “ bacteroids”: no doubt this is the case, since the “ bacteroids” are of the
nature of Fungi—yeast-cells—structures known to be particularly rich in potassium and
phosphorus as well as nitrogen.* Tscurrca employs the evidence of the analysis
in support of the hypothesis that the tubercles are normal organs used as storehouses
for reserve materials: the evidence, however, distinctly supports the view that the
protoplasm becomes surcharged with materials employed in the hypertrophy and for
the good of the parasite. Other facts, quoted by Tscurrcu in a different sense, are
equally in favour of this: for instance, the absence of sugar and the presence of fatty
substances in the winter.
