We emphasize,
however, that there is technically no fine-tuning in the pure Standard Model Higgs boson mass
computation: there is no higher mass scale within the Standard Model, because it does not include
gravity or higher scales such as those derived from grand unified theories. However, we shall
proceed on the basis that the hierarchy problem is pointing us in an interesting direction if we
take it seriously as a problem, expecting that gravitational degrees of freedom will induce a huge
quantum correction to the Higgs boson mass. If we examine the correction to the Higgs boson mass shown in figure 1, we note an interesting
fact: the large corrections have an different sign for the first contribution compared to the second. In fact, this is a property of quantum field theory: fermions give a negative sign, whereas bosons
give a positive sign. Supersymmetry provides a mathematical reason for a large cancellation
between the two diagrams, by imposing a symmetry on the quantum field theory between bosons
and fermions.
