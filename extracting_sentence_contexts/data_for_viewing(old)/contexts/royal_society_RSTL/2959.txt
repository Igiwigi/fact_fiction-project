inactive, the heat becomes oppressive to them, and they leave the hive in great numbers.

6. Mean Temperature during Summer and Winter.

We have seen that the natural temperature of the hive during the winter is very
mueh lower than during the summer, and that instead of the hive possessing a tem-
perature of 86* Fanr., as stated by HuBgs and other naturalists, it oceasionally has a
temperature even below 32 in very low states of the atmosphere, while its mean, or
average amount in the months of January and December, when it appears to have the
lowest temperature, may not exceed 45%, Tt is, however, regulated by the temperature
of the external atmosphere, being in a very mild season higher, and in a very severe
season lower than its usual mean. Without very much digressing from the subject
of the present paper, I cannot help remarking that a knowledge of these facts may
lead us toa practical application of them, in the preseryation and culture of the valu-
able insect which is the subject of these remarks, the Honey-bee. It tends to confirm
our opinion of the utility and prudence of the practice which is adopted by some
cultivators, of placing their beehives during the winter in vaults, or other subterranean
recesses, where they may remain in quietude, and in an almost uniform temperature,
unaffected by the changes of the varying season.

From the accompanying tables of the mean temperature of the hive, throughout
nearly the whole year, it is seen that the mean temperature in the different days and
months constantly maintains in every hive a certain relative amount of difference
above the temperature of the atmosphere, and that although occasionally interfered
with by casual circumstances, it is gradually increased from its minimum, in the
