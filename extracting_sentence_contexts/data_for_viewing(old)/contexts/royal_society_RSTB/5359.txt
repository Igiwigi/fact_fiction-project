CORALLIAN ROCKS OF OXFORD, ETC. 113

The upward sequence is continued in an old disused quarry on the opposite side of
the road, where the Urchin Marls, 2 ft. thick, are overlain by 3 ft. of Highworth Clay.
Between here and Friars Hill the Highworth Grit crops out, and on the top of the hill
a shallow pit near the cross-roads shows massive Isastreean coral rag of Osmington
Oolite age, resting upon a yellow, oolitic, sandy rubble. Descending the southern side
of Friars Hill, the road to Watchfield crosses a steep slope formed of the outcrop of the
Highworth Grit, then flattens out for a mile across a plateau formed of the T'rigonia
perlata Limestones. Now, in the distance of half a mile, during which the higher rocks
of Friars Hill conceal the outcrop, a great change comes over the limestones and, instead
of the usual oolitic limestones with Trigoni@ and other shells, we find massive Thamnas-
trean and Isastrean corals littering the fields ; the latter bear, in fact, the aspect typical
of fields situated upon the Osmington Oolite coral rag. The reef is only a local one,
for a small quarry a quarter of a mile due east of West Mill shows the limestones once
more in their normal condition.

Several old quarries close to the road N.W. of West Mill penetrate this reef, and, though
only a few feet of coralline limestones are now exposed, the neighbourhood of the quarries
provides a good collecting ground. ‘The fauna is of peculiar interest, for it is an
admixture of many of the shells highly characteristic of the ordinary shelly limestone
facies with the true “ coral fauna” characteristic of the coral rag; Lima zonata and
Chlamys nattheimensis, everywhere so common in association with the reef-building
corals in the later Osmington Oolite coral rag, here make their earliest appearance. At
the same time ammonites are conspicuously absent.
