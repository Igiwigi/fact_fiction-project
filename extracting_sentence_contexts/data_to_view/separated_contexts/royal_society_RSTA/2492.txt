If all goes well, PROVER9 will find a proof that bypasses that
clause. Here is the result.

% Length of proof is 192.

% Level of proof is 33.

% Maximum clause weight is 41. Note that we had a very significant drop in the proof length, and in fact, the maximum clause
weight dropped well below our cut-off of 48. PROVER9 was forced to search among clauses of
smaller weight and it paid off. Let us try again, reducing the maximum clause weight to 40.
