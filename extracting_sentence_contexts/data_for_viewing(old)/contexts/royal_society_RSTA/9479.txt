days we have a balance of (—1541+564+304)y or —673y, as compared with a true
secular change of —22°6 x 11ly or —249y. This suggests an instrumental drift at the
average rate of —39y per annum, ~

The chief importance perhaps of these calculations is the light they throw on the
trustworthiness of the magnetic curves and measurements. It is unnecessary to
emphasise the fact that when instrumental creep is large it is a source of very

considerable uncertainty. The results obtained above are not put forward as exact

measures of the instrumental creep, but only as showing its order of magnitude and

the general fact that it was small. Most of the quiet day curves were measured

many years before the others, and a variety of scales were employed. Then the
curves of the 209 originally selected disturbed days were not smoothed, while those of
the ordinary days were. Thus in a good many cases, at the midnight common to a
disturbed and an ordinary day two readings were taken, at widely different times,
one on the unsmoothed curve, the other on a smooth pencil trace. In individual cases
these two midnight readings differed considerably, and this of course influenced the
balance of the n.c. changes. The difference between the n.c. changes in H on the
