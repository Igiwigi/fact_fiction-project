Amplitude noise corresponds to
power fluctuations, whereas phase noise (instantaneous frequency jitter) manifests in minuscule
(and not noticeable by the human eye) variations of the colour of the light. An equivalent way
of displaying this is as an arrow (so-called phasor) in the phase space picture on figure 3b. The
uncertainty in both amplitude and phase of the light is clearly visible here; in the fact, the tip of
the red arrow can be anywhere within the ball made up by the blue dots. Now let us examine these uncertainties in more detail: in the phase space picture of a coherent
state—the light emitted by a well-stabilized laser—the coherent amplitude (related to the laser
power) is represented by the arrow, the uncertainty of the state is shown as a shaded ‘ball’. The
