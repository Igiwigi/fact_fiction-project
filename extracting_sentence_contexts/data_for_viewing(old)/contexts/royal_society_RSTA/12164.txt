consideration of the discontinuity in the medium, we must imagine as above a flow
rotational displacement along the wire so long as the capacity of one of the condensers —
is being altered; and the velocity in the field will be deducible, by the ordinary a
formule for a continuous medium, from this ideal flow together with the actu:
changes of displacement throughout the dielectric. For a perfect conductor
circumstances will be exactly represented by confining this flow to its surface; wha
is required to make the analytical formule applicable, without modification ©
account of discontinuity in the medium, is simply the addition of such an ideal flow
at the places of discontinuity as shall render the displacement (/, g, 4) circuita
throughout the field, without disturbing its actual distribution in the volume of tl
media.

The kinetic and potential energies of the medium may in fact either be caleula ‘
for the actual configuration, when they will involve surface integral terms extend
over the surfaces of discontinuity, or they may be calculated as for a continuo
medium if we take into account a flow of displacement along these surfaces, such |
we would require to introduce by some agency if the medium were perlec
continuous, in order to establish the actually existing state of motion throughout 1

in estimating the energy of the medium in terms of the flow of displacement these
| surface sheets must be included, after the manner of vortex sheets in hydrodynamics,
In the same way, when the electric charge on a conductor is executing oscillations,
