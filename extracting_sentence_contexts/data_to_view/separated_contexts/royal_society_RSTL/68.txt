II. 4n Account of Animal Secretion, the quantity of ©
of Blvad in the Human Body, and Muſcular Motion, |
By James'Keill, M. D. |

HE Author'of rheſe Diſcourſes, prefixes a Preface,
wherein he ſhows the neceſſity of a right Know-

ledge of the Principles ottrue Philoſophy, and of the A- *
'nimal Oeconomy in the | Prattice of Phyfick ; where '
our Skill in curing Dil-aſes, whoſe Hiftories are known,
is always proportional to our Knowledge of the Anis |

lolophy of Hhpocrates being built on a certain propenſion -
which ſome things have to one another, whereby they f
