It is known that for A > 0 equation (A 1) has three different real solutions, while for A < 0 it
has only one real solution. For A = 0, we have either (i) two different real solutions (two roots are
coinciding) or ii) one real solution (all three roots are coinciding). One can readily verify that these
facts confirm the classification of the number of solutions presented in §3 (up to exclusion of one
of the solutions for 4 = 4g corresponding to x = xq.) We note that the case A = 0 takes place when
A =A; for some i=a,c,d. In the subcase (ii) we obtain solutions x = x, =1 (for w <0, A =A,) and
X=Xqg=X_ = —2 (for a > 0,m =4 and A=4, = 4g = 1/4), which are forbidden by our restrictions. For Aa =A =0, we obtain W = 32(m — 1)3m(m — 2)(—Ag)Acdg > 0 for m> 2 or A <0.
