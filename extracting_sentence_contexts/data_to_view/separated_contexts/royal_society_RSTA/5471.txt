The electric field acts —
in the positive x direction. Visualization was obtained through the VMD software. (Online version in colour.) 8

cathode wall, the plot plateaued around a constant value as more and more counterions piled up
at the cathode interface. An equivalent temporal pattern was not observed for the MSD in any of nea)
the other directions, due to the fact those counterions could move freely along the y and z axes. :
As made evident in table 2, the presence of the electric field had the twofold effect of breaking the [4
isotropy of the material and facilitating counterions’ transport in all directions; both these effects DSS
were more pronounced for the strongest electric field. [8

Qualitatively similar trends were observed for water transport (figure 5 and table 2), albeit : =
we did not register a plateau in the MSD plot in the x direction as walls were permeable to water ,
molecules. In particular, we confirmed anisotropy in water transport, along with a beneficial effect
of the electric field. These similarities are likely associated with the migration of water molecules
towards the cathode that accompanied sodium counterions.
