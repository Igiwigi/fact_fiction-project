that provide more mechanistic or species-specific details of (iii) competence in streptococci, like S. pneumoniae, is induced

competence induction and transformation [15-17]. for only a short time period during exponential growth when


other resources are highly abundant [15], (iv) transported DNA
is heavily protected against nuclease digestion within the cell,
potentially enabling transported fragments to remain intact as
a substrate for recombination [27], and (v) the hypothesis does
not explain why several species that become competent for
natural transformation only take up DNA from close relatives
due to conserved DNA uptake sequences (DUS) despite the
fact that non-homologous DNA could be used as a source of
nucleotides for direct use or degradation [19,28]. In addition
to these concerns, it remains uncertain, on energetic grounds,
whether the costs of DNA transport are sufficiently offset by
any metabolic savings provided by exogenous DNA [11].
Thus, despite the intuitive appeal of this idea, the evidence in
its favour is currently limited.

(c) DNA repair

An old idea for a potential benefit of transformation is that
acquired DNA is used as a substrate for genome repair
[29,30]. Early experimental evidence indicated an immediate
