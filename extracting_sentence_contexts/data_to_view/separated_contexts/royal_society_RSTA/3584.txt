Capitalists invested in machines, which made it possible
to appropriate more work from humans and nature, creating ever-more surplus. A substantial
portion of surplus was directed to science, research and development that led to the invention
of new machines, and the appropriation of more work from nature, further fuelling this cycle
of growth. Empirical facts confirm this theory. There is a strong correlation between the input of useful
energy—that is energy left after subtracting the energy lost in its production and conversion—
and economic output [14]. Economists accounting for growth attribute it mostly to ‘total factor :
productivity’—a name given to all factors other than capital and labour that affect growth—a [=
shorthand for ‘technological progress’.
