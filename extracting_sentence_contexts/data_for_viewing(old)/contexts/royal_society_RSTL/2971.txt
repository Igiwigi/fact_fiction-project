'Thus the chamber of the aquatic shell is increased, not only, as is the land shell, 80
that it may contain the greater bulk of the Mollusk, but s0 that more and more of it
may be left unoccupied. Now the capacity of the shell and the dimensions of the
animal began together, and they increase thus in a constant ratio; the whole bulk of
the animal bears therefore a constant ratio, of greater inequality, to the whole capacity
of the shell, in aquatic shells : in land $hells, it is probably equal to it.

Now let the generating curve of a shell be conceived to describe, as it revolves
round its axis, a series of snccessive equal angles, represented each by A ©. Corre-

curve, will be certain increments of the capacity of the shell ; and it appears from the
following mathematical investigation of the properties of conchoidal surfaces (see
equation 19.), that the increments of the capacity of the shell, thus taken, will bein a
constant ratio to the then existing whole capacities of the shell. The increment of
the animal's bulk corresponding to each of these increments of the shell must then be
in a constant ratio to its then existing bulk ; that is, the animal's growth correspond-
ing to a given increment, A ©, in the angle described by the generating curve of its
