In my instrument, one division of the scale cor-
responds to 53> of an inch when it is at the distance of 16,6
inches from the lens; and since the apparent magnitude in
small angles varies in the simple inverse ratio of this distance,
each division of the same scale will correspond to +5; at the
distance of 84 inches, and the intermediate fractions 55,

55, &c, are found by intervals of 1,66 inch marked on the
outside of the tube, The basis on which these indications were
founded-in this instrument, was a wire carefully ascertained



a single-lens Micrometer. 121

Since any error in the original estimate of this wire must per-
vade all subsequent measures derived from it, the substance
employed was pure gold drawn till fifty-two inches in length
weighed exactly five grains. If we assume the specific gravity
of gold to be 19,6, a cylindrical inch will weigh g837 grains,
and we may thence infer the diameter of such a wire to be +;
of an inch, more nearly than can be ascertained by any other
method. For the sake of rendering the scale more accurate,
a similar method was in fact pursued with several gold wires,
of different sizes, weighed with equal care ; and the subdivi-

of 16,6 inches, and hence one division ==

$ions of the exterior scale were made to correspond with the
average of their indications. In making use of this micrometer for taking the measure
of any object, it would be sufficient at any one accidental posi-
tion of the tube to note the number on the outside as deno-
minator, and to observe the number of divisions and decimal
parts which the subject of examination occupies, on the interior
scale, as numerator of a fraction expressing its dimensions in
proportional parts of an inch ; but it is preferable to obtain
an integer as numerator, by sliding the tube inward or out-
ward, till the image of the wire is seen to correspond with
some exact number of divisions, not only for the sake of
greater simplicity in the arithmetical computation, but because
we can by the eye judge-more correctly of actual coincidence,,
than of the comparative magnitudes of adjacent intervals. The smallest quantity, which the graduations of this instru-
