there exist sets of values satisfying the reduced
system, but not satisfying the given /-fold relation. 32. In fact consider a /-fold relation the aggregate of less than all of the onefold rela-
tions of the asyzygetic system, and in connexion therewith an omitted onefold relation ;
this omitted relation is not implied in the aggregate, and it constitutes with the aggre-
gate not a (4&+1)fold, but only a fold relation. 'This happens as follows, viz. the
omitted relation is a factor of a composite onefold relation distributively implied in the
aggregate; hence the aggregate is compoxsite, and it implies distributively a composite
onefold relation composed of the omitted relation and of an associated onefold relation ;
that is, the aggregate will be satisfied by values which satisfy the omitted relation, and
also by values which (not satisfying the omitted relation) satisfy the associated relation
Jjust referred to.
