being done at the time. The facts then stated, and the conclusions drawn being
similar to, but less complete than those presented in this paper, no reference to the

Scope of Present Paper.

In the course of the present paper we present the work done during the last three
years, largely in the field and in mines where the “coal balls” occur, but also in the
laboratory. The facts here described illustrate :—The internal structure of the
“coal balls,” and their relation to the coal in which they oceur, their size and
position in the seams, their chemical composition, and their relation to the “ roof
nodules” above them. Many of these facts give support to the view of the origin
in situ of the calcareous “coal balls.”* We also present facts in support of the
statement that they occur in more than one geological horizon ; experiments and
deductions showing the importance of the peaty acids and sea water in the preserva-
tion and fossilisation of the plant tissues in the coal balls, and the possible chemical
reactions which took place during the process of mineralisation. Further, a com-
parison is made between the type of flora found in the roof shales and nodules and
that in the seam, and their respective origins.

Delicacy of the Tissues preserved.—Before examining the masses as actually seen
in the mine itself, it may be well to remind the reader of the extreme delicacy
