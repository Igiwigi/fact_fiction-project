the Euler-Lagrange proof is that they already assume that the roots of an algebraic equation
exist somewhere, to apply the Viéte formulae, and derive that then these roots are in fact complex.
Retrospectively, after the work of Kronecker, this proof is correct to all effects. The problems in
d’Alembert’s proof are slightly more serious, but I would assess it as essentially correct, as we
know the later work of Weierstrass.

Unfortunately, the same does not apply to Gauf’s first proof, which if not quite false, is
severely problematic. In fact, unlike the two preceding proofs that today can be easily patched
by a first-year undergraduate student, Gauf’s first proof contains a huge gap, that was only
fixed by Ostrowski [6] in 1920, and that even today would be non-trivial to fill for a professional
mathematician outside of the field. Smale [7] describes the situation as follows: ‘I wish to point
out what an immense gap Gauss’s proof contained. It is a subtle point even today that a real
algebraic plane curve cannot enter a disk without leaving. In fact even though Gauss redid this
proof 50 years later, the gap remained. It was not until 1920 that Gauss’ proof was completed.’


e Let me quote several momentous statements chosen at random from the 1821 Cours
d’analyse by Cauchy [8], where he ‘set the foundation of rigour’ for modern Analysis:
‘Each continuous function is differentiable almost everywhere’, ‘The sum of a convergent
series of continuous functions is itself continuous’, ‘A function of several variables,
continuous in each variable is continuous’, ‘Any essential singularity is a pole’.
Browsing this textbook for a few minutes, you will easily find dozens of similar
statements, ‘accompanied by complete and detailed proofs.’ (Of course, I know Lakatos’s
objections [9] that Cauchy made no mistakes, but was arguing in terms of non-standard
Analysis. Iam not convinced, since most early authors praise Cauchy precisely for getting
