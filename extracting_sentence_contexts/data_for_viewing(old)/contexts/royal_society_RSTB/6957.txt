gynoecium there are more adnate interseminal scales forming the ‘upper flange’, and then
the thickly cutinized axis projects for 2-3 mm. forming the corona. The present account
agrees with that given by Thomas, who regards the flat facets of the corona as the places
moulded by the tips of the microsporophylls in bud. The margins of the facets are limited
by a mere bend in the cuticle, and their lower margins trespass on the top of the gynoecium
and include some of the uppermost scales.

(b) Bracts

Five flowers show attached bracts clearly; various naked axes show bract scars and there
are many isolated bracts forming a varied series. Thomas described some of these isolated
bracts but concluded that they were vegetative bud scales and that the flower was normally
naked. It is likely enough that some of them are in fact vegetative, but the vegetative buds
of this plant are as yet unknown.

The attached bracts are all members of the inner perianth, the outer ones being attri-
buted to it on circumstantial evidence. These attached ones are about 15 mm. long,
1-5-2:0 mm. wide near the base and taper to a point. Their substance is fairly dense, and
in the lower part shows some small pimple-like thickenings. The back and margins, and
to a less extent the upper side, are covered with fine hairs up to 1 mm. long.

The cuticle (figure 2 A, C) is moderately thick (2-4) on both sides and easy to prepare.
The upper shows rows of rectangular cells, short in some, long in other specimens. There
are no stomata and hairs are frequent in some specimens, rare in others. The cell surface
is mottled and often longitudinally striate. The lower side shows less regular cells, hairs
