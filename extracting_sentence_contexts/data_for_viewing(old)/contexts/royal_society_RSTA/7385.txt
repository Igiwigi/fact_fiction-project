seems considerably larger than could reasonably have been expected. If the free
produced by ionization of the terrestrial atmosphere its temperature in these regions must be at
least 7200° K. The results might alternatively be explained on the assumption that the electrons
are falling in from outside, and if this were so it might account for the relationship between the

occurrence of whistlers and magnetic activity.

Between about 15 ke/s and 20 Me/s the only important natural sources of radio waves are
lightning flashes, and the impulsive atmospherics to which they give rise can be heard as
clicks on a receiver tuned to any point in this band. On going, however, to the very lowest
frequencies, in fact to radio waves of audible frequency, there appear atmospherics of a
totally different and more musical, tonal kind. Chief among these is an atmospheric which
in its commonest form consists of a whistling tone of steadily falling pitch; starting above
the upper limit of hearing the frequency falls at first rapidly, then more slowly at the lower
frequencies, sweeping down through several octaves in the space of one or two seconds. This

forms the subject of the present investigations.

Different workers have referred to these atmospherics by different names, principally
‘swish’, ‘whistler’ and ‘long whistler’, this last to distinguish them from the ‘short whistler’,
‘tweek’, or ‘chink’, which is the short (about 20ms) musical tone produced by repeated
reflexion between the earth and the ionosphere of the waves from a distant lightning flash.
Here they will simply be called ‘whistlers’.
