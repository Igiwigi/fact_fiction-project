Indeed 80 general has been the opinion that there is no penetration by the sperma-
tozoon, even into the envelopes of the egg, notwithstanding Wacxer'sFf announce-
ment that he had seen spermatozoa within the envelopes in the eggs of Fishes, that
one of the most recent investigators, M. QUaTREFaGcss, in alluding to MM. Prevosr
and Dumas' views, observes, that * it is nseless to allude to the question of penetra-
tion by the spermatozoon, as he believes that the only living author of the theory has
himself renounced it}.‚Äù But very recently it has been announced, in a paper on
the Ascaris Mystar, by Dr. NEeLs0N, communicated to the Royal Society, that the
spermatozoon in that animal does penetrate into the snbstance of the yelk; and a
somewhat similar account of that of the Earth-worm was formerly given by Dr. ArzTfur
Fare ||. Yet, with all due respect for the observations of these able investigators, I
must still have hesitated to admit the fact of any penetration, eyen into the envelopes
of the egg, had I not more recently been convinced of this fact by direct observa-
tion, in correction of my former opinions, in s0 far as relates to the penetration of
the spermatozoon into the envelopes of the eggs of the Frog, and its arrival at the
vitelline membrane. To them, then, be all honour on this subject, while I subjoin
my testimony to a fact which I had heretofore failed to observe.

It was during the month of March last (1852), while making experiments on the
Frog's egg by artificial impregnation, before some scientific friends, that certain
appearances were noticed beneath the microscope within the expanded jelly of the
egg, which led to a snspicion of the probability of penetration by the spermatozoon.
Heretofore I had employed, in my observations, either a deep glass cell, in which the
egg was completely immersed in water, or the common object-glass of the microscope.
In the experiments now referred to, a shallow glass cell was employed, which was
