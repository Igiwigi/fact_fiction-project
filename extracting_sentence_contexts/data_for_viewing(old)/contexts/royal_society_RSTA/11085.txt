of a distortional plane wave in an infinite solid. This for continuous rock of the
nature of that which forms the crust of the earth is about 2°6 kiloms. per second, so
that if we take the rate of propagation of the greatest surface waves at 2°9 kiloms.
per second, the excess is just about what the defect should be.

The form of the molecular movement in the waves investigated by Lord Ray.eicn,
does not seem to be consonant with that recorded in the neighbourhood of the origin.
At great distances it may be in closer accord, but apart from this, the rate of propa-
gation of the purely elastic surface waves is not a function of either their length or
amplitude, while that of the great surface undulations of an earthquake appears
to be a function of one or both of these. This is intelligible if, as was suggested by
Lord Krtvin,* the propagation of these waves is accelerated by gravity, and the
fact that the rate of propagation seems to be in some way a function of their size is
a support to the suggestion.

§ 8. There remain now for notice only those cases where the record has commenced
earlier than the time at which the condensational waves, set up by the earthquake
to which the record is attributed, would be expected to emerge. In all, seven such
eases are included in the records noticed above, and are tabulated below.
