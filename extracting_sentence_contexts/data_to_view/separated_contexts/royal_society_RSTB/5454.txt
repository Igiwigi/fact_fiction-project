From the embryo there is for a time a constant release of isolated cells into the yolk. These are liberated from the whole length of the mesoderm and most markedly from the
anterior mesenteron rudiment. â€˜This fact has already been referred to on p. 17. When
the mesoderm is first congregated into paired segmental masses, but not yet forming
definite somites, certain cells, those nearest the yolk, are set free, and for a time they
form an indiscreet sheet of cells partially separating the embryo from the yolk (figs. 16
and 18).
