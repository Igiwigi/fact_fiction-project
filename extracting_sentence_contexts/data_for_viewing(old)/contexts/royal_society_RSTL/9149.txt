the sixth day. Next night, however, the temperature rose, and in the morning of the

i seventh day all the segments were dead.
id I have dwelt thus at length upon the differences between the results yielded by Dr.
A Ener's experiments and those yielded by my own, because, although these differences
Py L refer to points that were of minor importance at the time when Dr. Engr published
E his paper—a fact which, doubtless, led this observyer, 80 well skilled in dealing with the
S great and peculiar difficulties that attend such an investigation of these and allied
S organisms, to neglect repeating these subordinate experiments a sufficient number of
{: times,—still it will shortly be seen that, at the stage which the inquiry has now
& reached, it is of great importance to be in possession of accurate and precise data with
E regard to the points which we have just been considering®,
b=] * [T here withdraw from the proof a footnote mentioning the fact that T had obtained histological evidence
= of the presence of nerve-cells and fibres in Aurelia aurita, I withdraw this note because it is now ren-
© dered superfluous by the much more extended and detailed histological researches of my friend Mr. Scnirss.
S Perhaps, however, it is desirable to state that my own histological work was merely of a cursory nature, suffi-
i= cient only to show that there was here a splendid field for further cultivation, In accordance with my original
7 plan, however, I deferred all systematic inquiry concerning the histological part of the subject till the more
4 important of the physiological experiments should haye been completed—not because I underrated the import-
A ance of a thorough re-investigation of the histology of the Medus, but, on the contrary, because I deemed 8uch
EZ a re-investigation to be of 80 much importance that T hoped best to give it the attention which it deseryed by
Z postponing this difficult part of the inquiry until I should be able to deyote to it my undivided attention,
= But as the physiology of the 8ubject continued to open up more and more, I felt it was undesirable, either, on
V the one hand, to 8uspend this part of the inquiry, or, on the other hand, any longer to defer a careful deyelop-
FS! ment of the histological part. Accordingly I represented the case to Mr. Scxiyss, who with great kindness
