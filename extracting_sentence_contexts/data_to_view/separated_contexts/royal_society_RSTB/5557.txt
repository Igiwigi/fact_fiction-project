From personal observations such forms are characteristically ovoid
in shape and live with but their siphons projecting above the surface of the sand, and
there is little doubt that the larger individuals are safer from engulfment by the shifting
sand or mud than the smaller ones. The attached species of shallower water and the littoral zone are colonists from the
sand flats, a view already expressed by GarsTane (1928). This view is supported by
the fact that the majority of all Molgulids live unattached, a few are anchored merely
by a slender stalk, and the majority of attached forms retain an adherent covering of
sand grains, while even in others typical test hairs are present. The adaptation for
attachment to a three-dimensional surface (sand-immersed) tends to unfit an ascidian
for attachment to a two-dimensional surface (rock or weed), the ideal shape of the first
being a sphere, of the second a film. When a sand-living Molgulid colonizes rocks, etc., the settling is commenced as
larve.
