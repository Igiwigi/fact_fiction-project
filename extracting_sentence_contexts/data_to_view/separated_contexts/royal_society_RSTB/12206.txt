cp19k is low in amino acid complexity and particularly rich 2
in Gly across all species, with glycine making up 20.5% of There was no evidence that recombinant cp19k from P. polli- S

complexity has been associated with nanofibre formation faces and in conditions mimicking the gland cell or the 8
and Gly-rich regions, in particular, are linked to amyloid seawater environment.
