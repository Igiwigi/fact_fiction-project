Thus Ig2, < 671, for all 6 > 1. Hence, for all y € (A/2,A),

If y € (0,A/2), repeat the steps above with replacing y with 4 — y. a

By concentration compactness, there is a subsequence {ug, a

such that u;,(- — yj) > uo in L’, for some tg € H1(R2). We will show first that yy is a bounded
sequence. In fact, we have the following.

Lemma 2.3. The sequence {y;} C R? is bounded.

Proof. We argue by contradiction. Let {y;} be unbounded (and after picking a subsequence,
denoted again by {y;}), so that lim; |y;| =0o and y;/|y;| > (cos(6o), sin(@p)) € S'. Without loss of
generality, ux,(x) = ox, (Ix) eX", for real-valued functions Pk; Let € > 0. Then, there is N and jo,
so that for all j > jo,
