blood-corpuscles are generated by a like process; the difference between the condi-
tion of these objects in the embryo and in the adult of the same animal, being appa-
rently referable to a difference in the degree of their development as cells.

70. An incidental observation may perhaps be mentioned here. 'The brain in the
embryo of the Ox, at certain periods, appears to consist almost entirely of objects
such as those in figs. 59 and 60; which, it will be seen, are composed of discs.
Before the addition of acetic acid, such objects in many instances are surrounded by
a halo, which seems to represent the membrane of a minute cell. If the objects now
mentioned be compared with some of the nuelei of blood-corpuscles which I haye
figured, it will be found that there is a remarkable similarity between them.

71. On a review of the facts stated in the course of the present communication,
the opinion I have been led to form, is that the mode of evolution of the minute
mammiferous oyum is deserving of close attention in connection with some of the
processes by which nourishment is communicated, and the growth of the body
effected at all future periods of life.

APPENDIX.

The following additional remarks were kept out of the memoir itself, for the pur-
pose of rendering it as simple and brief as possible.

72. The chemical reagent principally used in the investigations forming the sub-
ject, of this paper, has been dilute acetic acid of the strength of distilled vinegar. I
