been 8ome slight slip of their ends through the vice. No sign, however, of anything
of the kind could be detected, and on re-suspending and again testing them almost
exactly the same results were obtained. Finally, the permanent loading was gradually
increased in amount to determine if any error had arisen from the wires not having
been sufficiently straight. It was hardly expected that this would prove to be the case,
as before any of these trials had taken place the wires had been previously loaded for
at least 24 hours to such an extent as to cause considerable permanent elongation.
Nor indeed could any appreciable change in the measurements be detected until the
weights used were such as to. produce further permanent elongation.

When this happened, however, there was evidently an apparent alteration of
elasticity. A reference to the notes made on previous occasions then revealed the fact
that whenever the above-mentioned discrepancies had occurred a similar permanent
elongation had been produced. A fresh series of experiments was therefore begun,
which ended in the discovery of the following facts â€”

1. In the case of a wire which has suffered permanent extension the temporary
elongation which can be produced by any load becomes less as the interval between the
period of permanent extension and that of applying the load becomes greater,*

2. This increase of elasticity is greater in proportion for great loads than for small
ones.

3. The increase of elasticity takes place whether the wire is allowed to remain loaded
