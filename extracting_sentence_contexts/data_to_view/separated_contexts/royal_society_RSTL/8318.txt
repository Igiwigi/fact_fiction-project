REPORT ON THE EXPLORATION OF BRIXHAM CAVE. 565

a given zone,â€”that zone being generally above the deposit of caye-earth covering up
e remains of animals which may previously have frequented the cave. Tn the instance, however, of the Brixcham Cave, although we have in evidence these
imitive works of man, they are so few and s0 scattered, and they occur also on leyels
widely different (no two, in fact, of the fifteen flint implements found there having been
met with on the same level), that it is not possible to conceive that man inhabited the
e at any time. The specimens are not numerous enough: they are found isolated
and without any corroborative adjunets. 5
