The most
commonly found proteins in their results were different isoforms of keratin, which comes as no
surprise to anyone who has ever prepared samples in the laboratory for protein identification
by MS; human keratins are a ubiquitous and highly abundant contaminant resulting from
sample handling. In contrast, in our results, the most abundant protein observed was various isoforms of
collagen. While it is not possible to distinguish the source of the keratins present, the fact that
they are present at much lower amounts than the collagens identified suggests that they originate
from the mummy. Contamination from sample handling would be expected to introduce keratins
in much greater abundance. Our morphological study clearly showed that these skin tissues
of Egyptian mummies are mainly composed of collagen fibres.
