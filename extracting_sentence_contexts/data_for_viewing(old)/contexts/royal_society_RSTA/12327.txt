_ motions round an axis, the velocities at different distances from the axis must be
inversely as those distances.

But now, in truth, the ideal case which Hapiny touched upon, was quite outside
of the scope of the real conditions of the atmospheric motions, which he professed to
_ explain better than had been done in the attempts of others before his time. He had
amply sufficient reason for his averment, to the effect that the real trade-wind air in
_ its approach from the tropic to the Equator, under the influence of indraught towards
the Equator, should be expected at each new place nearer to the Equator than the
_ previous one, to have a less velocity of eastward absolute motion than the surface of
the sea has at that new place, and that the frictional drag eastward applied to the
air by the sea surface will only act towards assimilation of the eastward velocity of
the air to that of the water, while still in principle, as in fact, leaving the air to go
slower eastward than does the waterâ€”that is, to blow as a westward wind relative
to the ocean. If what he professed to do had been to bring into notice a special

variety of vortex motion, constituting what we may call a vortex of free mobility in
a frictionless fluid, and to offer a dynamic theory of its motions, and if his theory had
included such an error as the one in question; then his theory would have been
fundamentally erroneous. But such was not at all what he professed to do. He
proposed to explain certain large and very remarkable phenomena of the observed
winds. This he did well, and in doing so he made a very important advance in
