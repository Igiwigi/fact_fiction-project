The unconsolidated sedimentary layer thickness is greater than has been found by
Ewing (1950) in the north-western Atlantic Ocean Basin. In a depth of 2800 fm. (5100 m)
and with the assumption of a uniform velocity of 5600 ft./s (1-7 km/s) he calculates a
thickness of 4500 ft. (1370 m). It would seem possible that this thickness should be in-
creased because of the fact that no allowance has been made for the increase of velocity
with depth. . If this layer does not represent undisturbed deep-sea sediments, then the most probable
explanation of its origin is that it represents the seaward edge of a continental shelf
shallowing to the north-eastwards which has been subsequently downwarped. The thick-
ness is consistent with the seismic measurements made on the European (Bullard &
Gaskell 1941) and eastern United States (Ewing et al. 1937, 1939, 1940, 19500) continental
shelves.
