ties, where, from the abundance of turgid capillary vessels, the tubes assumed a
bright scarlet appearance. The cavities of the oviducts were filled with, and much
distended by, a thick bloody mucus, which readily escaped from their peritoneal
apertures when the tubes were subjected to slight pressure between the finger and
thumb. Both of the Fallopian tubes were carefully laid open by means of a pair of
fine scissors—the operation being conducted on a clean white plate, containing a
little water,—and their contents were minutely examined. The right tube did not
present any object worthy of notice ; but the left one contained, at about. 1 inch from
its distal extremity, a small white vesicular-looking body, which on being floated out
into the water, was found to be rather ragged on its surface, and to have the size of
the cavity noticed in the recently ruptured Graafian follicle. This body was sub-
mitted to microscopical examination. When viewed as an opake object, nothing
could be made out beyond the fact that it was covered with white floeculi. It was
then placed between two pieces of glass, and examined by the aid of transmitted
light; but it was too opake for the eye to distinguish its structure, notwithstanding
that the flocculi were very transJucent and were seen to be made up of oval nucleated
cells (see fig. 6). By the employment of slight pressure the body was readily crusbed,
and then I could perceive that it was composed of a mass of nucleated cells, among
which, at one part, there was a number of highly refractive oil-globules (see fig. 5).
The result of this investigation led me to think that the body in question was an
oyule, the elements of which had been $0 far disarranged by the pressure, that the
membrana granulosa and yelk-globules were the only recognisable constituents of it.

The fluid contained in the uterus and Fallopian tubes were likewise subjected to
mieroscopical examination. "That removed from the former was found to consist
