TOMLINSON ON THE INFLUENCE OF STRESS

These results give an alteration of 1160 X 10-22 per unit in the resistance for a
pressure of 1 grm. per 8quare centimetre, and as in the cage of copper mecrease of
pressure produces diminution of resistance. : '

The experiments were again put an end to by a flaw in the insulation, which was
made on attempting to carry the pressure to a greater extent, and therefore the final
result can only be considered as very roughly correct. Fortunately, however, there is
a means of testing approximately the accuracy of this result, as ib was found that at
the temperature of the room (about 4* C.) the heat cansed by the compression of the
metal exactly balanced the effect of the pressure on the wire—s0 exactly, indeed, that
even when pressures of 3000 Ibs. per square inch were employed, the instant after the
removal of the pressure there was no change whatever mn the resistance, but in a few
econds afterwards the resistance began to. decrease, and apparently attained a
minimum in about half an hour. About this fact there can be no doubt, as it was
repeated geveral times and with several different pressures. Now-the change of tem-
perature produced by an alteration of fluid pressure amounting to 1 grm. per 8quare

Therefore the rise of temperature caused by an increase of pressure of 1 grm. per
£quare centimetre would be '000000264* C. ; and since the increase of resistance of
the wire for 1* C. at 4* O. had by preliminary experiments been determined to be
almost exactly '0047 per unit of resistance, the increase of resistance due to the heat
of compression would be *000000264 X *0047, or 1241 x 10-P—a regult which agrees
fairly with that arrived at by direct experiment.
