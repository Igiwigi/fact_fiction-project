possible to extract scene gist as fast as we can (the ‘seeing
the forest before the trees’ problem) and how we select
among the many motor plans that are activated by the mul-
titude of stimuli in our surroundings. But when we take
into consideration how we experience our brains doing this,
an entirely different matter arises, that of consciousness. We
are not mere automatons executing reflexes ‘in the dark’.
We see the ball that we hit during a tennis match, we feel
the urgency when we grasp that glass. Somewhere along
the way, a conscious experience of what we see arises.
Where, when and how does that ‘magic’ happen? And why?

The short answer to the when and how is: after the fact.
Feedforward processing itself is unconscious. The arguments
for that have been laid out in many past reviews [12-15],
showing considerable consensus on the matter. In short,
when visual processing is artificially restricted to the feedfor-
ward sweep, it appears that features are extracted and that
potential motor responses are activated yet that people
remain completely unconscious of these events or of the
visual stimulus that has set them in motion. The most
widely applied method for doing so has been backward
masking—i.e. showing a visual stimulus very briefly and
then have it followed by another stimulus, the mask. This
typically renders the visual stimulus completely invisible
