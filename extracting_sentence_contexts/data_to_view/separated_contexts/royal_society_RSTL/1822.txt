It clearly appears, that in their flight
they exceeded the.progress of the thaw, as thenorthern birds
did that of the frost. This thaw, though it was again suc-
ceeded by frost, came on very rapidly, and occasioned, by
the sudden melting of the snow, those destructive inundations
through the kingdom, that will not readily be forgotten. This account of the fieldfare sets the fact of migration,
though from an accidental cause, beyond the reach of doubt. There was no support for it here ; the ground was deeply
covered with snow, and the intense frost, by its long dura-
tion, had destroyed every thing that could afford it succour ;
it must, therefore, have taken a long flight from this coun-
try, and returned to it again at the approach of temperate
weather. Having already made s0 many digressions, I cannot add
another without offering an apology ; but as there is some-
thing s0 like providential design in the order in which the
song birds chaunt out their warblings during a long sum-
mers day, I trust the Society will pardon my laying before
them the following observations on the subject.
