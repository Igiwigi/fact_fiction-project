It seems
therefore to be highly improbable that the Cycadofilices could have descended from
plants to which the name of “ fern,” as understood in recent botany, can be applied. What the progenitors of the Cycadofilices were, for the present remains unknown. As to the ancestry of the Cycadofilices, 1 believe that they and the Marattiacee
have descended from a common stock and this seems borne out by the fact that
the microsporangia of some of the Cycadofilices—those with a single loculus—
have considerable resemblance to the sporangia of the Marattiacee, for to the

Cycadofilices I would refer such genera as Telangium, Dactylotheca, Urnatopteris,
Sphyropteris and most probably Renaultia, believing that what have been regarded
simply as “ sporangia,” are in reality microsporangia. There is another most distinct character of Arch@opteris which persists to the
present time amongst the Marattiacea, and that is the stipular appendages at the
base of the petiole (fig. 13). Such a structure has been observed on Archeopteris hibernica, ForBES sp.,
Archaopteris fimbriata, Navuorst, and Archaopieris Roemeriana, Gore sp.t
