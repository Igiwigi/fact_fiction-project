(3) The distance in clean air was decreased by contaminating the solid faces. (4) The difficulty with which a cylinder can be forced down on to a plate and the
relative ease with which it can be wrung down. Of these the two first are perhaps accounted for by the fact that on either hypothesis
the pressure P is the difference between two quantities, both of which may be functions
of the nature of the lubricant and of the solids. P may then be a pure function of the
geometry of the system over an extremely wide range of conditions. The effect of the contaminant seems to point to the conclusion that the attraction
of the solid is not a shadowless force as Laplace assumed, but a force which, like chemical
affinity, can be saturated.
