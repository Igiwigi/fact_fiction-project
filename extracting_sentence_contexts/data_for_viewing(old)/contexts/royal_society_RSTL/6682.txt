most, marked features of the solar-diurnal variation, and which are found to prevail

univyersally in all the extratropical parts of the northern hemisphere, are, an extreme

deflection to the observer's right (or towards the magnetic east) about 8 A.Mt., and an

extreme deflection to the observer's left (or towards the magnetic west) about 2 P.M.

660 MAJOR-GENERAL SABINE ON THE RESULTS OF HOURLY OBSERVATIONS

Whenever the phenomena are viewed within the aforesaid limits, the facts thus referred
to are identical when expressed magnetically.

This description of the solar-diurnal variation, in which all geographical relations are
put aside, applies with equal correctness to the phenomena at Port Kennedy and at
Point Barrow ; but when geographical relations are again introduced, the same pheno-
mena have to be described in a very different manner, and the two stations become
widely distinguished from each other*. The marked end of the magnet, when looked
at at 8 A.M., is 8cen at Port Kennedy to have moved from its mean position of S. 35* W.
towards the geographical West, and at Point Barrow to haye moved from its mean position
of N. 41*E. towards the geographical Fast; and correspondingly at 2 p.x. the marked end
is at Port Kennedy to the geographical Z#ast of its mean position, and at Point Barrow
to the geographical West. The bearing of this distinction between the magnetical and
