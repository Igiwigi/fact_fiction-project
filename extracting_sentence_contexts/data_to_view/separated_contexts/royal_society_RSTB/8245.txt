The presence of coldwater-seeking deepwater species
Perhaps, the most striking feature of the functional on the ESS could be an indication of the water cooling
equivalence applied to the ESS is the presence of that occurred on the ESS in the late-1980s and early-
many deepwater species such as argentine (Argentina 1990s, which also led to increases in coldwater shrimp
sphyraena), grenadier (Nezumia bairdi) and hakes and snow crabs. Furthermore, though grey seals
(Merluccius bilinearis). Surprisingly, cod was not impli- increased in abundance at the same time, grey seals are
cated in the ESS collapse despite the fact that cod not deep divers and if the deepwater species remained
were a highly targeted species prior to collapse. The in the shelf basins and slope water, they would be less
inclusion of grey seals is also expected as they were susceptible to grey seal predation than would cod. Phil.
