The ventral border as far as one can judge of it appears
to lie not so distally on the mid-ventral line of the limb as does ventral border of the
Vth. The most distal part of the mid-ventral line of the limb is therefore occupied
by the Vth lumbar field, but the most distal part of the mid-ventral line of the
limb is occupied by the VIth lumbar field. This is in harmony with the fact that
the ventral edge of the IIIrd lumbar field is the first to leave the mid-ventral line of
the trunk and run to a lateral extension of the mid-ventral line on the limb, while
the commencement of the mid-dorsal line of the limb is not made until the IVth
lumbar segment is reached. A means of testing the correctness of this determination
of the borders of the VIth lumbar skin-field lies in delimiting the field and then
determining the modification in its area produced by section of the posterior or the
anterior half of the root. This I did in three experiments with the results detailed
above.
