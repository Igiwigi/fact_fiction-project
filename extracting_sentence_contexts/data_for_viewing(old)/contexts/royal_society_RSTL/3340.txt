perly. This derangement, which in the ordinary mode of polishing by the hand is
perceived at once by the feel, is as s0on perceptible with the machine, becanse mi-
nute bubbles from the air, which bas insinuated itself between the speculum and the
polisher, are immediately observable. For some time this difficulty was exceedingly
puzzling, and it was not until after many abortive attempts that the cause became
evident : during the operation of polishing, the abraded matter, mixed with the polish-
ing powder, is in part taken up by the pitch, but not equally oyer the whole sarface ;
as, however, pitch is not sensibly elastic with a moderate pressure, wherever most is
taken up, there the surface will be most prominent, and the figure of the polisher de-
stroyed, unless the pitch can spread laterally. To allow of this lateral expansion a
certain thickness of pitch is necessary, and I found, as might indeed have been an-
ticipated, that the thickness required to be increased with the size of the speculum :
in fact, if I may be allowed s0 to express myself, that the necessary thickness was
some function of the diameter of the speculum, By using a layer of pitch sufficiently
thick, a solid speculum of twenty inches aperture and a divided speculum of twenty-
four inches aperture, the subjects of these and many other experiments, were made
to define tolerably with a low power, and, at the swme time, had acquired a high polish.

Mr. Epwarps mentions that he had found, that, unless the pitch was of sufficient thick-
ness, it would not preserve its figure; he had observed the fact correctly : in assign-
ing the cause he was evidently in error, as he attributed it to the circumstance that
the thin coat of pitch, as he supposed, acquired more heat from the friction than the
