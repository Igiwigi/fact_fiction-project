This may be related to the fact that bachelor males spend
much of their time alone and, thus, have relatively few
opportunities to form intragroup coalitions.

Among the 39 species of primates included in our dataset;
intragroup coalitions were found within both sexes for most
species (90%). Male-only and female-only coalitions are = =
