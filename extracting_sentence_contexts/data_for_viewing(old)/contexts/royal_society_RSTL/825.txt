58 Capt. Karen's experiments for determining the

knife edge, or from a line terminating a surface, are liable to
much uncertainty from what has been called 7rradiation, or
indistinctness of the image. But this is by no means the fact ;
for if the reflection of light from the knife edge be prevented,
and it be viewed on a white ground, it may be made to bisect
the cross threads of the microscope, with nearly the same
precision as could be attained by the use of a line. There
is, however, a correction necessary to be applied in this case,
and I hall proceed to describe the method employed for as-
certaining its amount.

A slip of writing-paper was pasted on the mahogany case,
under each knife edge, extending beyond it about the tenth
of an inch, and adjoining, was a piece of black paper to pre-
vent the reflection of light on the knife edge from the sur-
