this point has been reached some of the nuclei gradually diminish in size, and their
original seat is marked by a. collection of granules. 'These granules are sometimes
absorbed, and the seat of the original nucleus is marked by a short line which gradually
tapers at the two extremities until it is lost.

It is almost needless to say that no alteration produced by the different contractions
of the muscle in different parts, would account for the position of the nuclei observed
in the fine fibres of the papillze of the frog's tongue.

'These views, it need scarcely be said, differ entirely from those generally entertained
upon the development and formation of muscular tissue. They are supported by
detailed observations made in all classes of animals, and in the same species at different
periods of age. There are 8ome facts in connexion with the changes occurring in disease
which afford support to this view, which involves three positions. That in the nutrition
of muscle the pabulum invariably becomes converted into germinal matter; that the
latter undergoes change, and gradually becomes contractile tissue ; and that all the con-
tractile material of muscle was once in the state of the material of which the nuclei or
masses of germinal matter are composed. It is not deposited from the blood, nor pro-
duced by the action of the nuclei at a distance, but it results from a change in the very
matter of the nucleus itself. The manner in which this occurs has been already dis-
cussed in the paper above referred to (Archives, No. XIV.). It was shown that the
oval nucleus could be followed into a very fine band of contractile tissxue or fibrilla
(Plate XXII. fig. 13). We pass from the matter of the nucleus into very transparent
imperfectly-formed tissue in which no transverse lines are perceptible, an and from this
into fully-developed contractile material in which the characteristic transverse markings
