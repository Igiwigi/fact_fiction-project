2. Prequel to the current model of allantois
development

When earnest study of the mouse allantois began several dec-
ades ago, facts were scarce. The general morphological
sequence of allantois development in rodents had been
described [1,2], and included the spatio-temporal where-
abouts of the allantoic bud, its enlargement and extension
toward the chorion, and union with the latter to create the
chorio-allantoic placenta (figure 1a). The allantois appeared
to issue from the posterior end of the embryo in register
with its primitive streak, or body axis, whose physical bound-
aries were claimed to be limited to the embryo [7,8].
