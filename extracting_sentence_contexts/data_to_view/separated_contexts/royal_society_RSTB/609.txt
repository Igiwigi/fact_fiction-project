With regard to the “ecrossed” pyramidal fibres described by Prrres,* Homen,t
and Suerrimncton{—the latter author states that he found degenerated fibres in the
crossed pyramidal tract of the opposite side in Monkeys. I was unable to satisfy
myself of their existence in Cases III. and VII. This, however, is due to the fact
that the fibres are scattered, and the animals were allowed to live a sufficiently long
time to produce a true sclerosis and disappearance in part of the degenerated fibres. The ascending degeneration above the lesion.—The degeneration of Goxt’s column
in a perfect hemisection is limited to the same side, and it disappears at the post-
pyramidal nucleus. The degeneration of the postero-external column soon disappears, partly because most
of the fibres are short and soon terminate in the grey matter, and partly because the
long fibres run towards the mid line to ascend in Gott’s column. 4

The antero-lateral tract of GowErs.—The degeneration in this tract could be
traced upwards as far as the nucleus lateralis, the number of degenerated fibres rapidly
diminishing in the medulla.
