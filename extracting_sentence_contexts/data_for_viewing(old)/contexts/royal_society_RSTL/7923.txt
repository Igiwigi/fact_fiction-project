progressed, and the temperature of the air fell, clouds were again formed, and from 1b 40m
up to the time of totality it was impossible to make any observations, as the 8wn was
never unclouded for more than a few seconds at a time; indeed just before totality a
slight shower of rain fell. As the illuminated portion of the solar disk gradually increased
after totality, the clouds rapidly disappeared, the estimated amount falling from 9 (over-
cast=10) to 3 in about fifteen minutes. 'The observations were then regularly continued
to within a few minutes of last contact.

Although the disk and by far the greater portion of the heavens were completelyobscured
by clouds during the period of totality, rendering any determination of the photochemical
action perfectly valueless in view of our special object, it was yet thought worth while
to attempt to estimate the chemical intensity of the feebly diffused light at this time,
That it has a certain degree of actinism is of course evident from the fact that photo-
graphs can be taken during totality. Immediately, therefore, after the supposed com-
mencement of totality the slit was opened, and the sensitive paper exposed for ninety-five
seconds; as the end of totality was very plainly indicated about two or three seconds
after the slit had been again closed, it was clear that the paper had been exposed only
during the period of totality. Not the slightest action, however, could be detected on
the paper; on comparing them in the dark room it appeared considerably lighter than
the extreme light end of the graduated strip. 'The calibration of the fixed strip employed
in our measurements was not carried out to the extreme limits of the tinted portion, but
on the supposition that it decreased uniformly in shade from end to end; or, in other
words, assuming that the curve representing the decrement in intensity of tint maintained
its symmetrical character throughout, which is a perfectly legitimate assumption to
make when we bear in mind the manner in which these tinted strips are made, it follows
