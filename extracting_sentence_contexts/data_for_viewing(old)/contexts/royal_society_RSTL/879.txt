SECTION III.

ON THE COMPARATIVE WEAR OF GOLD, WHEN ALLOYED BY
VARIOUS METALS.

The comparative wear of gold, especially when in the form
of coin, has never yet been ascertained ; the opinions con-
cerning it are therefore various. The most prevalent idea ap-
pears to be, that pure or ductile gold suffers more in a given
time, under equal circumstances, than that which is of a harder
quality.

Supposing this fact to be well established, it would not be
difficult to render gold as hard as could be desired; for, as
certain metals, when employed in equal proportions, cause gold
to become of very different degrees of hardness, it would be
easy even to make gold perfectly hard and brittle, without
changing the standard proportion of alloy, provided that such
extreme hardness was compatible with the process of coining.

But the question, whether ductile or hard and brittle gold
sustains the greatest loss by wear, under equal circumstances,
has by no means been fully determined; and Mr. Harris ap-
pears to have considered hard metal as the most liable to suffer,
it being, when compared to that which is pure and soft, more
