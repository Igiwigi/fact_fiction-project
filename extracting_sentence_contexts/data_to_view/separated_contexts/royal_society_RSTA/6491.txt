Such very rapid rates for Central India are partly confirmed by observations made
during the present year (1886) in a tower at Allahabad, which for April and May
give initial rates of decrement of 40° and 37°5° per thousand feet respectively at the
time of diurnal maximum. According to the law of decrement deduced from the last Table, the topsy-turvy
movements described by CuamBers would, at the hottest time of the day, ascend the
slopes of the North-Western Himalaya to an elevation of some 2600 feet ; while, over
the mountain tops of Central India and Rajputana, they would rise to above 11,000
feet, if the same law of temperature decrement held good.*

The heights thus computed, of course, have no pretension to exactness ; in fact, the
former is undoubtedly too low, for the temperature decreases much less rapidly on #
broad mountain zone heated by the sun than it does in the free atmosphere. They
suffice, however, to show that about midday, in the hot season, convective currents are
very active up to an altitude of several thousand feet over the drier part of Northern
and Central India. It is probable, therefore, that the wind direction anomalies, which
are so striking at this season, may be explained by the descent, from a considerable
height, of atmospheric strata which retain, for a time, the velocity acquired by them
under the pressure differences prevailing at the level from which they descend.

* The temperature of the Himalayan slope may be represented by the formula ¢=T— 75h
+ 1:07? — 0:08, while according to the ultimate law of convection ¢ = T — 5-46h; T being the sea-
level temperature and h the height expressed in thousands of feet.
