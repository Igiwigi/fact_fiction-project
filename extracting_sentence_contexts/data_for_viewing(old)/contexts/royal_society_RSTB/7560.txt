No graft destruction occurred in the present experiments without the accompanying
lymphocyte and plasma-cell reaction. But cancer investigators find that homografts of
tumours sometimes regress without the usual cellular infiltration (e.g. Potter & Findley
1935). Skin homografts appear to undergo a very mild and variable round-cell infiltration
(Gibson & Medawar 1943; Dempster, Lennox & Boag 1950) and especially second-set

grafts (Medawar 1944). But since in these grafts the main inflammatory reaction (appar-
ently with much round cell infiltration) occurred in the graft ‘bed’ (i.e. the adjoining host
dermis), the fact that the graft proper was not significantly invaded is weakened as an
argument.

(ii) Evidence from the first-set grafts

The only relationship found between the speed of breakdown of the present homografts
and their cellular infiltration was for the lymphocytes in the grafis at 8 days after trans-
plantation, i.e. just at the beginning of breakdown for the average set of grafts; the faster
the speed of breakdown the greater was the lymphocyte concentration at this time
(P<0-05). This result can be interpreted in terms either of cause or effect (a strong
vascular inflammation indicated that the immunity reaction had begun). It is not sur-
prising that such a relationship was not found at 12 days, since the destructive reaction
would then be on the wane in the more rapidly destroyed grafts. The fact that no relation-
