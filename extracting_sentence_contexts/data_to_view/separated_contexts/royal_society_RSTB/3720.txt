With regard to the development of the resin plates PanaaLtow (p. 56) states
that “the resin gathers locally upon the inner face of the tracheid wall, and as its
volume increases it projects from all sides towards the centre, where it coalesces to
form a continuous and imperforate septum.” The form of the resin deposit that
I have found is not such as can be accounted for as above. It does often appear in
radial and tangential sections (fig. 41, Plate 4, and figs. 44a and b, and 47, Plate 5)
like plates or spools, but with proper stain it may be seen to line the tracheids far
above and below the transverse part. In fact where two spools come fairly near one
another in vertical sequence, the ends of the spools unite. When similar appear-
ances are found in both sections this can only mean that the deposit encloses
acavity. Smaller bubble-like cavities may also occur in the axis of the spool or in
the body of the deposit itself when this is large (figs. 44a, 47, 50, and 52, Plate 5).
