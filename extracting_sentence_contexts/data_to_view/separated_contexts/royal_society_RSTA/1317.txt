These studies are continued by Makoveeva & Alexandrov [23]. Namely,
three important effects (the shift in the phase transition temperature induced by the Gibbs—
Thomson effects and atomic kinetics, as well as the effect induced by the non-stationary evolution
of individual crystals) on the nonlinear dynamics of particulate assemblages in supercooled
and supersaturated liquids is analysed. This paper confirms the fact that three effects under
consideration substantially change the desupercooling/desupersaturation dynamics and the
transient behaviour of the particle-size distribution function in metastable liquids. The asymptotic
state of the distribution function (its ‘tail’), which determines the relaxation dynamics of the
concluding (Ostwald ripening) stage of a phase transformation process, is also derived. This ‘tail’
is used in the next paper [24], which is devoted to the Ostwald ripening theory developing in the
presence of the simultaneous occurrence of various mass transfer mechanisms: this extends the
well-known Lifshitz-Slyozov theory.
