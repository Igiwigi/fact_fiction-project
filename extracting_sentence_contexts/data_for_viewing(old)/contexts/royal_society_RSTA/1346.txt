and then, using ideas of Cherkaev & Gibiansky [35], make a transformation to an equivalent
problem where the tensor entering the constitutive law is real, symmetric and positive definite
(see [36] and section 12.11 of [7]). Also one can introduce a periodic vector potential v for j — (j)
in (2.13) so that j — (j) is expressed in terms of the antisymmetric part of Vv using the completely
antisymmetric Levi-Civita tensor giving j — (j) = V x v, while on the other hand the Levi—Civita
tensor applied to VV gives an antisymmetric field that has zero divergence. Then the equations

can be manipulated into the same form as (2.8)-(2.11) with real of = o\).

(a) Equivalence between problems (2.1) and (2.2)

The connection between problems (2.1) and (2.2) is implicit in existing results. To see this, we first
consider a problem associated with, and in fact equivalent to, problem (2.2). This is to characterize
the G-closure associated with the equations

in which J(x) and E(x) satisfy the same constraints as in problem 2.2, K; and Kp are positive
definite and given by (2.6), the indicator function x(x) is again given by (2.10), but not subject to
the constraint that (x) =f, 0 is a constant scalar, and s(x) is an arbitrary scalar valued function
having the same periodicity as x(x). The effective tensor K,, is defined by the linear relation
