Krauser,
from his experiments and dissections on Lepus and Cynomolgus, also supported the
“law” of VANDERKOLK|| and Hirron,{ to wit, that a muscle is supplied with nerve-
fibres by the same spinal nerve as innervates the skin overlying it. In this again
Kravsz is as directly controverted by examination of the fore-limb as of the hind. Also, in speaking of the longest nerve-fibres, as those in the VIIIth cervical root,
Krause must be ignorant of the fact that the Ist and [Ind thoracic roots send nerve
fibres to the intrinsic muscles of the hand. SECTION IV.—SPINAL REFLEX ACTION. The above examination of the peripheral distribution of the roots of the spinal
nerves was undertaken “as a step preliminary to observations on the reflex functions
of the spinal cord.”**
