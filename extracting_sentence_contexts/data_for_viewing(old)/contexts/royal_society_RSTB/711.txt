such is thrown well cephalad, and the fornicate gyrus is carried forward along the
mesial surface, as may be seen from an inspection of the transverse sections of
Plate A. Thus it happens that the caudal portion of the dorsal commissural system
is much more highly developed than the cephalic or callosal portion. The latter
consists of a few fibres which spring from the region about the anterior prolongation
of the splenial fissure, if this term may be applied to the fissure which bounds the
cephalad continuation of the fornicate gyrus.” No description of the tract in question
is contained in the paper.

ZUCKERKANDL{ also describes the brain of Ornithorhynchus, although he is careful
to state that the brain was badly preserved. He also simply names the decussation
of the fornix “der rudimentiire Balken,” and, although the ‘“Randbogen” is the
structure under discussion, he overlooks the fact that it passes right above his sup-
posed corpus callosum to the front of the hemisphere.

If, as appears to me to be the case, the corpus callosum is totally absent in
