in the following months, during the prevalence of the south-west monsoon, winds from
south, s8outh-west, and west are frequent. In respect of mean velocity, there are two
epochs of maximum and two of minimum annually. The former occur in April and
September, the latter in July and December; of these, the April maximum is the abs0-
lute maximum of the year, and the December minimum is generally below that of July.

At Seebsaugor, winds from the north and north-east amount together to 54 per cent.

from Tibet) preponderates considerably over that from the sea. Nevertheless the
climate of Seebsaugor, though cool, is not. 80 dry as this fact might lead us to antici-
