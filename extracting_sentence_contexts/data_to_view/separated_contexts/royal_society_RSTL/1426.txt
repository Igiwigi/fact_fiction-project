Again, if salt of British
production, should be. proved to be really inferior in chemical
purity to foreign salt, it would be important to ascertain, as
the basis of all attempts towards its improvement, in what,
precisely, this. inferiority consists... It 8eemed. desirable, also,
to examine whether any differences of chemical compoxition
exist among the. several varieties of home-made salt, which
can explain their yariable fitness for economical purposes,

Such were the considerations that induced me to undertake
an enquiry, which. has occupied, for several months past, a
large share of my leisure and attention. I began the investi-
gation, wholly uninfluenced by any preconceived opinions on
the subject ; and I had no motive to see the facts in any other
than their true-light, since I have no personal interest; either
directly or remotely, in.the decision, of the question.

The principal sources of the salt, which is manufactured in
this country, are rock salt, brine springs, and sea water. The .
first material- is: confined entirely, and the second chiefly,
though not wholly, to a- particular district of Cheshire. Of
the extent and boundaries of this district, the process of, ma-
nufacture, and other circumstances interesting to the. minera-
logist as well as to the .chemist, an ample and excellent
history has been given by Mr.
