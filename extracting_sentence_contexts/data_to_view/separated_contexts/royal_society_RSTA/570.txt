The report analyses in depth the
chain of events and includes findings and recommendations about safety and the nuclear safety
culture. We note as a preamble, that not a single one of the twenty one members of the panel was
a tsunami expert, in the sense that it is usually understood, i.e. with a record of earlier research
and journal publications on tsunamis. This was probably because of the fact that the emphasis of
the US National Research Council panel was on mechanical issues and the nuclear safety culture. The report is overall excellent with a meticulous discussion of the background of US and Japanese
NPPs and a detailed analysis of the timetable of the accident. A very useful recommendation is
that a high priority should be given to protecting DC batteries and power distribution systems.
