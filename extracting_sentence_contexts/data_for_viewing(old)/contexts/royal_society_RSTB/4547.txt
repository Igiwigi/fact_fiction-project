§ Eupodocarpus shows a medium thickness.

Prof. Ourver’s work has conclusively shown that Yorreya possesses one of the
most primitively organised seeds among living Gymnosperms. From his study of the
seed of Cephalotawus, WorsDELL (1900, pp. 317-18) has come to a similar conclusion
with regard to this genus. The resemblance in the general morphology of the
female shoot of Tawus and Cordaites has also been widely recognised. These
considerations impelled me to search for possible archaic features in the mature seed
of Taxus, and to attempt to describe it in terms of Torreya, which, according to
Prof. Otrver’s well-known theory, is not difficult to derive from a type like
Cardiocarpus. The result of this search has been to convince me that the seed of
Taxus is in some respects even more primitive than that of Torreya, appearing, in
fact, to form the terminal link in a remarkable chain of seed-types, leading from
Cardiocarpus through Cycadinocarpus, Rhabdospermum, Mitrospermum, and
Taxospernum, to the living genus Taxus.

It would take us too far here to discuss the relations between the different stages
of this series, which, although not by any means suggested as representing the actual
course of evolution, yet appears to illustrate progression along certain well-marked
tendencies, which would seem to bridge up the structural gap between the seeds of

the Cordaitales and those of the Taxales. I hope shortly to deal with this subject in
