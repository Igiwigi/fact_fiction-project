The latter was obtained directly from SCADA data by [50]. However, in


the planning phase of a wind farm, there is usually little technical information about the wind
turbines to be used. In this case, the best approach may be to exploit the fact that most modern
wind turbines are tip-speed regulated to rated wind speed after which they are power regulated. For wind speeds less than rated, (2.8) may be employed with a taken as optimal. At wind speeds
above rated, the average power coefficient is given by

where Pg is the generator power.
