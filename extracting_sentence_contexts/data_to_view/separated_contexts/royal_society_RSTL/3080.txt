(SERIES X1.) position of the existence of an electric fluid or fluids. It may be impossible to have
the one fluid or state in a free condition without its producing by induction the
other, and yet possible to have cases in which an isolated portion of matter in one
condition being uncharged, shall, by a change of state, eyolye one electricity or the
other: and though such evolved electricity might immediately induce the opposite
state in its neighbourhood, yet the mere evolution of one electricity without the other
in the first instance, would be a very important fact in the theory which as8umes a
fluid or fluids: these theories as I understand them assigning not the slightest reason
why such an effect should not occur.

1176. But on searching for such cases I cannot find one. Evolution by friction, as
is well known, gives both powers in equal proportion.
