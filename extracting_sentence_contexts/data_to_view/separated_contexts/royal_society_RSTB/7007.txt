The valve between the
two is the thin median strand of tissue running from the stomach wall to the hinder margin of
the pleats (figure 12) together with the parenchymatous sheets that I mention later (p. 117 and
figure 13). Nussbaumâ€™s paper is very difficult to follow, but it seems that he considers a system of arteries as
radiating from his ventricle, that is, the rostral sinus, up the cirri. Actually there is no such connexion
and his cirrus vessels which he considers afferent are in fact efferent. Nussbaum dealt with the musculature at great length. Unfortunately, it is usually impossible to
follow his detailed descriptions.
