The structure of the hypoderma is another point, though one of secondary impor-
tance, in which our Medullosa and Heterangium agree, and the arrangement of the
adventitious roots is also similar.* It is, however, on the agreement in the stelar
structure that stress is to be laid. This comes out much more clearly in M. anglica,
even than in M. Leuckarti, partly because we know the details better in the former
species, and partly because its structure is much simpler, and so allows of more
direct comparison,

The affinity which, as it seems to me, is now demonstrated between Medullosa and
Heterangium, is of much interest, for the genus Heterangium is one of the most Fern-
like of the Cycadofilices. Apart from the secondary thickening, the structure of the
stem in Heterangium is closely similar to that in the recent Gleichenia, while the
foliage is altogether Fern-like, and in fact almost certainly identical, as Srur’s descrip-
tion shows, with that of Sphenopteris elegans.t It would thus appear that Medullosa,
though so complex and highly specialized in many of its representatives, may well
have been derived, by fairly direct descent, from a simple Fern-stock. This does not,
of course, imply that any known form of Heterangium was the ancestor of any Medullosa
—a most improbable supposition—but that the Medulloseze generally may have sprung
from plants related to, and with the same type of stem-structure as Heterangium. Such
a view agrees better with the facts than would an attempt to derive the Medulloseze
from the Cladoxylez. The latter, indeed, conspicuously resemble the former in having
polystelic stems with secondary growth, but the structure of the individual steles is
strikingly different, notably in the fact that the primary wood of Cladoxylon consists
exclusively of scalariform trachese, without conjunctive parenchyma.{ I should, there-
fore, incline to regard the Cladoxylez as representing a parallel line of development
