Heating the phosphate before the blowpipe made little change in the character of
the phosphorescence. Ib was moistened with- sulphuric acid, heated to a dull redness,
and then tested, bub no further change was produced in the spectrum. This
experiment shows that the citron-band test for yttrium is far less delicate in the
presence of phosphoric acid than in its absence,

79. It is an old and probably a true saying that every element could be detected
everywhere had we sufficiently delicate tests for it. Early observations (10, 16) had
prepared me for the wide distribution of the element giving the citron band, and no
80oner had the exquisite sensitiveness of this spectrum test forced itself on my notice
than I gought for yttrium 1n other minerals. Facts which I had noticed in connexion
with the variation of the appearance of the citron spectrum, according to the quantity
of yttrium present, showea that it might be possible to devise a process for the rough
quantitative estimation or yttrmm, and after several experiments this was ultimately
carried out in the following manner :â€”

The calcic carbonate which was found to give no citron band (12) was boiled in a
quantity of nitric acid insufficient to dissolve it. The lution was filtered from the
insoluble residue, diluted to a convenient bulk, and standardised : 14:91 grains of
