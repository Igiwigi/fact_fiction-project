now appeared at the point where the dorsal and dorso-lateral septa unite. The ventro-
lateral filaments (»./,f.) are still longer and extend down to the level of the buds or
beyond them. The ventral filaments, finally, are very short, being intermediate in
length between the dorsal and dorso-lateral filaments,

This grouping of the filaments is quite constant and exists at a very early stage.
It is extremely difficult to determine whether these yarying lengths represent the
actual snccession of the filaments since the latter are in their early stages closely
contracted together and their arrangement cannot be made out. This grouping
persists for a long time and the dorsal filaments remain permanently shorter than the
others, and of different structure as K6L11KER has observed. (The dorsal filaments
are in many cases longer than the others, but this is, in {enzlla at least, only
apparent, and is due to the fact that they never become convoluted like those of
the lateral and ventral septa.) All of the filaments except the dorsal pair increase
rapidly in length and very 800n become folded back and forth and yariously convoluted
(see figs. 183, 205). This is a result of the cirenmstance that the filaments increase
in length much more rapidly than the septa which bear them, and they are necessarily
therefore thrown into folds or © gathers.”

The dorsal filaments grow backwards very slowly and are never thrown into
transverse folds (see figs. 183, 204). They are less opaque than the other filaments,
with a darker central line, and are of much less diameter than the others. These
differences are permanent and persist in the adult. The dorsal filaments always
remain in connexion with the cesophagus, and appear like long narrow prolongations
of the latter down upon the edges of the septa. The other filaments, though ab first
