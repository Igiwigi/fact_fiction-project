about the opaque mass, producing the reticular appearance shown in the stripe down the

b; middle of the sketch. I had in a preyious case seen a similar ring become affected with

JN quence of the pungent yapour of the volatile oil Playing upon the neighbouring parts
Z of the web, and there could be no doubt that the effect on the pigment in the present

E visible in the blood except close to the edge of the mustard, where the corpuscles were

[= the irritant had lain being examined, was found to be the seat of the most intense inflam-

Â© the pigment there had experienced only an exceedingly light degree of diffusion, being,
S in fact, almost exactly in the same state as at the commencement of the experiment.

FI upon it, arrested that very process of diffusion to which its gentler operation gives rise.
EZ In the progress of the case it happened that the animal changed from the medium

V hours after the mustard had been removed, the pigment on which it had acted retained
E its stellate disposition, and the reticular appearance in the surrounding ring als0
5 remained unchanged, showing that the power of concentration had been permanently
lost in thoge parts, and affording a favourable opportunity for obtaining by means of
