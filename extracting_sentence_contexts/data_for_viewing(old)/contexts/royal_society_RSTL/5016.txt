decomposition, the corpuscles of the chylaqueous fluid go on gradually disappearing.
The ova and sperm-cells accumulated in the fluid of the visceral cavity during the
eason of reproduction, also supersede, to a great extent, the proper corpuscles of
this fluid. At this period however the blood-system acquires a very conspicuously
augmented development.

In studying the histology of the solid elements of the fluids in the Invertebrata, it
is desirable to forearm the observer with one admonition. When these bodies dehisce
under the eye in the field of the microscope, the semifluid contents are projected out
in strings or filaments ; the highly fibrinous fluid contained in the cells coagulates
as it escapes. This appearance has deceived some observers into the supposition that
such cells are ciliated, epithelial, self-motive bodies. They are not 80. I have
ventured to estimate this frequent fact as a direct demonstration of the theory advo-
cated by some physiologists, that the floating cells of the fluids secrete a self-coagu-
lating principle. But at the present stage of this inquiry the question admits of no
reply, whether the mode indicated is the only process by which fibrine is generated in
the living fluids? It is probably not 80. My present conviction is that fibrine, at all
events in the vital fluids of the invertebrated animals, may be evolved in a non-
corpusculated fluid, in virtue of a zoo-chemical process enacted by the liquid per se.

Let us now proceed to a detailed description of the corpuscular elements discover-
able in the chylaqueous fluid of the principal families of the Annelida.

In Arenicola Piscatorum the chylaqueous fluid is very abundant ; the cavity in
which it is contained is scarcely at all partitioned by segmental septa. The floating cells
