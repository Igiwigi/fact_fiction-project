Furthermore, universal biology would immediately shed light on the question of the
ubiquity and inevitability of life, if it turned out that life is an inevitable consequence of the
laws of physics, to be expected in any sufficiently complicated environment that is sufficiently far
from equilibrium to enable multiple layers of hierarchical organization to exist, with numerous
feedbacks between them. Our prejudice is that this is the case: life is one of the processes that
allows planets to come to equilibrium. If life is, in fact, a means to dissipate free energy, one would expect that the mechanisms
behind all its universal properties involve free energy-driven non-equilibrium processes. One
of these universal features of life is homochiralityâ€”the fact that all the chiral amino acids used
by terrestrial biology are left handed (the sugars are right handed). The fact that this effect is
not a mere enantiomeric excess is surprising and requires a detailed explanation.
