It does not seem necessary, as the two surface
densities are themselves well known from the work of Kexvxry, to prove that our formula
— 2E/= cot~? c/a is again obtained by integrating the total charge. We may, in fact,
at this point take leave of the present problem as an illustration of our analysis. §20. Relation between Aperture and Dise Problems in Hlectrostatics and Hydrodynamics.
