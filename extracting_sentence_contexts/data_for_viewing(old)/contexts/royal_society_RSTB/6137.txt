postero-medial process consists of a relatively slender shaft flanked by narrow lateral
and broader inner flanges.

Fic, 80.—Microhyla ornata.—Transverse section of half larynx. ar’ = thin pharyngeal region of arytenoid.

The bronchial plates are only weakly fenestrated. M. constrictor laryngis anterior
extends even farther forward on the ventral surface of the hyoid than in M. berdmorei,
almost to the hyoglossal sinus.


504 KE. TREWAVAS ON THE HYOID AND LARYNX OF THE ANURA.

The hyoid and larynx of this specimen have been sectioned and the following facts
are revealed :—The ventral cushion of the hyoid plate, between the postero-medial
processes, consists of hyaline cartilage, with more matrix between the cells than in other
parts of hyoid and larynx. The extrahyals, on the other hand, consist of cartilage
with small elements and little matrix.

The aryteenoids are not fenestrated. At the aditus laryngis their edges are produced
into a thin layer of typical cartilage, which merges at its upper edge, without peri-
chondrium, into the firm‘connective tissue of the lip of the aditus. To this thin cartilage
the dilatator is attached. Dorsal and ventral pulvinaria vocalia are present and serve
for the attachment of m. constrictor laryngis posterior.
