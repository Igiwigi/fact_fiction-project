area of the Southern Ocean impacted by hydrothermal supply from different ridge systems.
Owing to their supply of Fe to relatively heavy isopycnal surfaces, Atlantic ridges only influence
7x 10'! m?. Alternatively, Pacific ridges influence 50 x 10!! m?, with Southern and Indian ridges
affecting 25x 10'! m? and 17 x 10'! m?, respectively. In other words, Pacific ridges have a


potentially sevenfold greater influence than Atlantic ridges. We note that this is the maximum
possible area over which we might anticipate carbon export to be affected. What is not accounted
for is the transit time, which will be important due to the loss of Fe via scavenging, colloidal
pumping etc. This explains why there is not a direct connection between these areal extents and
the relative carbon export affected by each ridge system (figure 5). For example, the greater impact
of Pacific ridges relative to Atlantic ridges in terms of carbon export can be linked to the fact
that hydrothermal Fe originated from Atlantic ridges can only reach a small surface area of the
Southern Ocean. On the other hand, Southern ridges have a greater carbon export impact than
might be expected from the outcrop area of the hydrothermal Fe they supply due to the shorter
transit times to Southern Ocean surface waters, which results in reduced Fe losses.

(a) Evidence of the stabilization of hydrothermal Fe from GEOTRACES sections

Across our modelling experiments, we find some support for the role of Fe stabilization in
hydrothermal plumes. The models with stabilization do a much better job for the GP-16 and
GA-02 sections, perform similarly to those with greater absolute Fe fluxes for GA-03 and
overestimate the hydrothermal anomaly for the CoFeMUG section. This suggests the need for an
