experiment. 'The rapid endosmic action of the envelopes of the egg at the instant of
their contact with any aqueous fluid, and the rapidity with which the yelk itself then
becomes affected, seemed to fayour the idea that if the bodies of the newly obtained
spermatozoa could be quickly reduced to a state of difluence simply by mechanical
means, without the addition of any menstruum, saving only a very small quantity of
water, and be applied in this state of diffluence to the egg at the instant after it has
left the body of the female,—that then an experiment thus made would be a fair test
of the question. Some imbibition of the substance of the spermatozoon with the
water might thus be expected to take place, and some changes in the egg to follow,
if impregnation be the result of simple chemical combination of the substance of the
male with that of the female. The presence in the experiment of a portion of water
holding the difluent spermatic substance in suspension, appeared at first sight to
be an objection, but this seemed to be met by the fact that water must always be pre-
Sent to ensure the natural fecundation of the Frog's egg ; and that it not only perme-

ates the envelopes, and is the means of facilitating the entrance of the spermatozoon,
but that it passes even to the substance of the yelk itself, as shown in the experiments
with large quantities of potass before alluded to, and also in others made by immer-

sion of eggs in water with given proportions of potass in solution. As the details of
these latter experiments are contained in a paper which is now in the Archives of
the Royal Society®, I need give but little more than the results of these experiments,

in the present communication, before proceeding to relate those now referred to with
