The close similarity of the phenomenology of solar and stellar activity constitutes the basis
of the ‘solar-stellar connection’ (e.g. [45,46]). The challenge of the solar-stellar connection is to
investigate the limitations of the solar analogy. In fact, several significant differences in solar and
stellar activity phenomena are also observed, especially going towards the extreme of activity. Active stars, for example, tend to have large polar spots (e.g. [47-49]), at odds with less active
stars like the Sun. Also, the high level of X-ray emission of active coronae, several orders of
magnitude larger than that of the Sun, cannot be simply reproduced by scaling up the solar
corona, i.e. covering the entire stellar surface with solar active regions (e.g. [50]).
