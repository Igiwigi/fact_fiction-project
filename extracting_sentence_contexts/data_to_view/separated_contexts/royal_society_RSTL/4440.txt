On the view I have stated the cause is plain. When nitric oxide acts chemi-
cally upon oxygen, the gas is thrown into a polar condition ; the result of which is
to give to other particles of the mass a combining power, in a direction the reverse
of that in which the oxygen combines with the nitric oxide; the change being in all
respects analogous to the decomposition of water by the joint action of nitric oxide
and chlorine*; thus—

NO, 00 $0,=NO,+80,. ER,

The best of the other explanations of this fact is, in my opinion, that of P#1160Tf, who
considers the formation of the sulphuric acid to be the result of the successive forma-
tion and decomposition of nitric acid. This, however, does but shift the difficulty to
another point ; for why does nitric acid oxidize sulphurous acid? In truth, in this
case, a perfectly similar polarization takes place within the acid itself—
