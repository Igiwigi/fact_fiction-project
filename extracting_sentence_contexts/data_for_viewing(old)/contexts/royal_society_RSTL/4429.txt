IT is not without considerable regret that I am compelled to depart from my esta-
blished rule of never publishing any facts relating to electro-physiology without having
previously endeayoured to connect them with those already discovered, and without
having succeeded in reproducing them in such a constant and unyarying manner as
to remove the slightest doubt of their truth. The announcement, however, just made
to the Acad6mie des Sciences by M. pu Bots Raymonp of a work *On the Law of Mus-
cular Current, and on the Modification which that law undergoes by the effect of Con-
traction,” obliges me, though unwillingly, to transmit to the Royal Society the con-
tinuation of my researches on induced contraction, confining myself, for the present.,
to s8ome fundamental experiments, made a long time since, for the publication of
which I should have wished to await a more favourable moment.

In the Third and Fifth Series of my Electro-physiological Researches*, I studied,
with all possible care, and in its minute details, the fact of induced contraction, in order
