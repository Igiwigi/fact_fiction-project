of a higher conducting power connected with its greater
density.

The consideration of these various facts, led me to adopt a
form of a lamp, in which the flame, by being supplied with
only a limited quantity of air, should produce such a quantity
of azote and carbonic acid, as to prevent the explosion of the
fire-damp, and which, by the nature of its apertures for giving
admittance and exit to the air, should be rendered incapable
of communicating any explosion to the external air.

If in a close lantern, supplied with a small aperture below
and another above, a lighted lamp having a very small wick
be placed, the natural flame gradually diminishes, till it
arrives at a point at which the supply of air is sufficient for
the combustion of a certain small quantity of oil ; if a lighted
