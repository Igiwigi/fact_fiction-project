spondingly, it seems quite possible that we have K E heterozygotes analogous to A K
and AE. It is also suggestive that this separation occurs in the earlier generations
—the third, fourth and fifth in our line-breeding and in F, and F; of our Ax E and
A x K crosses: after this the ¢ and « lines continue as such and the latter show no
tendency to throw off more E.

On the whole our results are compatible with this hypothesis, though we have no
clear evidence in its support from segregation ratios in the line-breeding. When we
test it directly by crossing K and HE, the results are equivocal. F, has 24 K broods
and 21 E broods, all of low E-ness, & = 5-5, and as a whole it is « rather than <, though
definitely more « than the « put into the cross. In F, the ratio between E and K
broods (16 : 51) would pass for 1 : 3, but the E broods quite fail to reproduce the high
E-ness of the original E parent, and they are in fact not certainly different qua per-
centage of dextrals from the E broods of F,. We may evade these difficulties by
assuming (1) that dominance is incomplete, (2) that the high E-ness put into the cross
is masked by the vigour of heterosis. This brings us into the predicament that we
cannot be sure whether a brood of, say, 150 sinistrals and 2 dextrals is a masked < brood
or a x brood, and, if we assume that these alternatives are exclusive, makes the formal
interpretation of K x E crosses impossible.

Or we may consider the possibility that E-ness is not of itself a type of sinistrality,
but the product of an independent gene whose only phenotypic effect is the modification
of sinistrality towards the production of odd dextrals and other monstrous forms, the
allelomorph being simply the absence of E-ness. This interpretation involves the
possibility that E-ness might be carried in « strains, though it could obtain expression
