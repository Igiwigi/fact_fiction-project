gravel, and organic remains lying on the shores, has already been discussed. In addi-

tion, however, to the ice 80 formed, observations of late years have Shown that a very
considerable formation of ice takes place along the beds of certain rivers, especially
when those beds are stony and gravelly, In these climates we rarely have the opportunity
of observing this phenomenon on a large scale, although, from a few facts noticed, it
appears even here to be far more common than has been supposed.

That this agent is one of considerable power in producing changes of the character
we are referring to, is evident from the facts recorded by ARAGo®, and the experiments
made by M. LrcLercef at Li6ge, and by Colonel Jacks0N in Russia. These observyers
show that most running streams give rise, under certain conditions, on the setting in of
