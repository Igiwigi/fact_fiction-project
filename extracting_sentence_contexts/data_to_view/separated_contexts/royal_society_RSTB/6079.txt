WrnKLER (1921, a),
who has studied this tract in an elaborate experimental investigation, states that it
extends some way caudally into the medulla, and that frontally it constitutes a dorsal
trigeminal lemniscus which is distributed mainly to the thalamus. Huser and
Crossy (1929, a) also regard the tract as lemniscal in nature. â€˜Taking into account
the facts that the fifth nerve already possesses a very good thalamic connection in
the medial lemniscus, and that the dorsal secondary path closely accompanies the
medial longtitudinal fasciculus and is related like this to the motor nuclei, it appears
more likely that it is a reflex co-ordination pathway exactly analogous to the medial
longitudinal fasciculus but related more intimately to the fifth nerve than to the
eighth. According to VAN VALKENBURG (1911) the mesencephalic nucleus of the fifth
nerve in Echidna is very like that in sub-mammalia in its almost exclusively mid-line
distribution. The marsupials exhibit a condition intermediate between that of
Echidna and the higher mammals in the better development of the lateral extensions.
