We can expect heterogeneity in the above density
values across the vast expanses of the Pleistocene mammoth
steppe. However, commercial tusk collection data from
Yedoma in different regions suggest similar numbers for
mammoth [31], and multi-taxon herbivory values in Mamon-
tovy Khayata—another intensively exposure east of the Lena
River Delta, as well as in the New Siberian Islands, are roughly
similar to those in Duvanniy Yar [66]. In fact, data from
multiple sources suggest herbivore biomass values ranging
between 8.8 and 10.5Mg of herbivores km™, with even
greater values in Great Britain in last interglacial [35],
suggesting that herbivore density values might have been
even higher in past interglacials, because improved climatic
conditions would translate in higher productivity. These
values are within the range of present-day African savannah
game reserves, 0.9-19.1 Mg of herbivores km? [35].

(a) The mammoth steppe and climate change

The Pleistocene mammoth steppe interacted with the Earth
System differently to the current wet tundra/forest-tundra. Key differences relevant to the thermal regime and carbon
budget, and hence climate change mitigation, are:

(i) grassland-dominated ecosystems have more reflective
surfaces than shrub-dominated tundra and _forest-
tundra, both because of vegetation type and exposed
snow cover, and thus enhanced albedo [31];

(ii) snow trampling in winter by large herbivores as they
move and forage for food implies a more compact
snow layer and reduced surface insulation from very
low winter air temperatures, enabling colder and
deeper winter soil freezing [31];

(iii) Gi) is enhanced by the lack of snow-trapping by shrubs
and trees [63,64];

(iv) increased evapotranspiration of graminoids promotes
lower soil moisture and decreases waterlogging
[23,31];

(v) large-herbivore densities increase nutrient cycling and
productivity by orders of magnitude, as the death-and-
slow-composition nutrient pathway is overwhelmed
by the herbivory-and-egestion pathway [23]; and

(vi) the root structure of grasses and forbs—they both have
deep, diffused roots, contrary to the shallow root sys-
tems of tundra shrubs and larch—increase soil carbon
storage in the first 1 m [21].
