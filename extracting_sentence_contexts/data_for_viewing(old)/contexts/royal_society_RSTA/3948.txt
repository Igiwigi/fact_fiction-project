authors demonstrate that a dominant fraction of these elements is transported in the :s
river and estuaries with particles. This solid load is deposited on the shelf and slope iS

and contributes to build oceanic margins on geological timescales [9]. This solid load
comprises the bedload flux and the suspended particle flux [10-12]. River discharge is
commonly understood as occurring at the Earth’s surface, most cases through estuarine
systems in areas subjected to tidal forcing, but can also meet directly salty water, as in the
Mediterranean Sea for example.

— Sediments. Once deposited on the margins, marine sediments act as chemical reactors to
release and adsorb species to and from seawater. Actually, distinguishing the riverine
solid load from the deposited sediments is not straightforward in coastal environments,
owing to the fact that they essentially refer to the freshness of the material. However,
recent works identified that submarine weathering of deposited material can act as a
source of trace elements and isotopes to the ocean, allowing the present distinction of
this later pathway [13-19].

— Submarine groundwater discharges (SGD). In the last two decades an increasing number of
studies underlined the importance of SGD. The term SGD includes the discharge of fresh
groundwater to coastal seas to which recirculation of seawater often contributes [19,20].
Subterranean estuary describes a reaction zone between seawater and groundwater with
seawater recirculating though permeable sediments [21-23]. As ‘open air’ rivers do, SGD
are vectors of dissolved and particulate chemical species to the ocean.
