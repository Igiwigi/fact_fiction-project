Amongst other Mammals this character is met with occasionally ; it may be well
seen in the Hyrax (Plate 16, fig. 1); in some Insectivora, notably in the Shrew;
in the Jerboa, and in a few other Rodents ; whilst in the human subject it may be
rarely found, but only in a rudimentary condition (fig. 2). The facts that the tubes do not reach to the exterior of the enamel, even in
Macropus ; that the penetration is variable, even amongst the Marsupials; that it
does not exist at all in the Wombat, and that the character reappears sporadically
amongst other Mammals, would seem to render the inference justifiable that striking,
and in some respects anomalous, as the character is, it cannot depend upon any very
radical difference in the developmental process from that which results in the
formation of an ordinary solid enamel. This inference is borne out by the investigations to be related, which prove to
throw much light upon the development of enamels other than those of Marsupials. In those Marsupials in which but few tubes enter the enamel, there is often little or
no dilatation at the point of passage, nor is there any marked deviation in direction,

but in the Macropods there is usually a well-marked dilatation at this point, and
there is usually also a sharp bend; there is, in fact, what might almost be described
as a clumsy joint ; this is noticeable, though to a less extent, in Hyrax.
