As a consequence, the problem of
power system stability can be expected to become even more relevant in the coming years. This
makes it important to derive easily and quickly verifiable analytic conditions for stability, which
is the topic addressed in the present work. A further motivation for our work is the fact that—despite the rich and extensive literature
on power system stability—even today many basic questions remain open. This applies to
the analysis of vast networks, but also to individual network components and is explained
by the complexity of their dynamics. Thus, researchers and practitioners alike are forced to
invoke several assumptions simplifying the mathematical tasks of stability analysis and control
design.
