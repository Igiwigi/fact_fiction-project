15 ,, extension,
4  ,, “interosseal position.”

At centre 85, where the greatest number of movements occurred, of 15 observations
flexion occurred 14 times. And at 87 also flexion was alone obtained.

In striking contrast to this representation of flexion at the lowest part of this region;
we find the movement of extension is alone represented at the highest part of the
region, viz., at centres 11 and 79. In front of the fissure of Rotanpo, a somewhat
different arrangement prevails at the upper part of the upper limb area. Here, as we
showed in our previous paper, movement of the fingers occurred very slightly in
degree and very late in time, and the character of this late and feeble movement
was flexion. This fact we have now confirmed in our re-examination of the border
centres 6 and 6’ (situated between the upper and lower limb centres).

(b.) Primary.—Of 11 movements,

4 were flexion,
3 ,, extension,
4 ,, abduction of the index.

The rarity of primary movement of the fingers here indicated is explicable by the
fact that in the ascending parietal gyrus the movements of the fingers are almost
universally secondary to those of the thumb. Thus of fifteen absolute movements of
the “all fingers” (7.e., excluding primary movements of the index), only 1 was a
