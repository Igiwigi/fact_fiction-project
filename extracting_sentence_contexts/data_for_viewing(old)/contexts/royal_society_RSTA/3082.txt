assessment of expected thermal noise from the bonds [51]. It culminated in the installation of the
final prototype, also including the quasi-monolithic fused-silica final stage, at the LASTI facility
at MIT in 2010 [52]. With a few minor adaptations the quad suspensions with a monolithic final
stage were then installed at the LIGO sites, and played a vital role in improving the seismic as
well as thermal noise. The design sensitivity as well as noise budgets for aLIGO are shown in
figure 3. With improvements to detector sensitivity still ongoing to reach design sensitivity, these
suspensions perform extremely well, reaching violin mode Qs (the inverse of mechanical loss) of
approximately 10° [49], and, as with GEO600, dampers are applied to help with the control of the
suspensions.

Virgo has also developed quasi-monolithic suspensions of a slightly different design [53], using
the same CO} laser technology to pull and weld fibres and using HCB for the jointing of interface
pieces (albeit with a different procedure). Virgo in fact implemented this design before aLIGO and
