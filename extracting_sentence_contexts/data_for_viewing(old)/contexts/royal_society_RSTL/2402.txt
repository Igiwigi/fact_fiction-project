be withdrawn from the lungs, unless yoltaic electricity be supplied, which enables it to breathe as well as when
the nervous influence is entire,

A proper apparatus, therefore, for sending voltaic electricity through the lungs in the direction of their nerves
and in due power, should be added to the other means of resuscitation, which would render them, and probably
to a great degree, more successful. The force of this observation will be perceived when it is considered that
it is at the time of the first application of the remedies that the chance of recovery is greatest, and consequently
that the immediate application of the whole means of healthy respiration, as far as we poszess them, is of most
consequence. It appears from what has been said, that the due functions of respiration cannot be restored
till the due degree of neryous influence is supplied, and this cannot happen from inflation of the lungs till the
due force of circulation returns. Now the fact, explain it as we may, is, that voltaic electricity 80 perfectly
supplies the place of the neryous influence in the lungs, that their functions are equally perfect under the influ-
ence of either. The one can only be supplicd at an adyanced period of recovery, that is, in fact, only in those
cases where the success of our endeayours can be secured by other means; the other is, in all cases, within our
reach on the instant,

but greater in degree, its influence is throughout confined to that system*, In the
former case we ce all the vital functions deranged; in the latter, the breathing alone
