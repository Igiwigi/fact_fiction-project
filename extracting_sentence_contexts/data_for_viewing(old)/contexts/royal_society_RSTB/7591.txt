Yet the evidence from table 13 is that there had been mortality, at least among the animals
first marked in September and November; if so, the observed recapture rate of the
January sample is lower than expected. From a subdivision of these data it seems that the
low recapture rate is not entirely explained by the excess of males (32g, 2799) or of
animals from lines 1 to 7 (32 from lines 1 to 7, 27 from lines 9 to 15) though both these
classes had higher death-rates. The fate of this sample must therefore be examined in
more detail.

We may first see if there was evidence that trapping in January had weakened the
unmarked voles and increased their subsequent death-rate. Conditions at the time were
not obviously severe and there was no abnormal death-rate in the traps on block Q, but
there was in fact a rather poor recovery of newly marked voles. This difference is not
statistically significant, however, and there is no evidence from other months that it might
have been expected. Indeed, the only other evidence—from the November sample—is
in the other direction. These two extreme instances are given below, animals first marked
in August being omitted in order to reduce any bias. The numbers recaptured include all
individuals known to have been alive in the next month:
