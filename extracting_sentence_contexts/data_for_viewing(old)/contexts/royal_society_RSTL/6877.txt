Here in each case the bromine has greatly increased the refraction ; but that this is
owing to its great weight is evident from the fact that the specific refractive energy is
much diminished. The dispersion is increased, but this is very nearly counterbalanced
by the increase of weight, 'The sensitiveness is diminished, at least in the ethylene
group.

1t will be observed that, in each of the five cases mentioned in this section where
there are two substitution products, the lower one is intermediate between the original
substance and the higher product.

These observations put us in a position to consider the question, Does an element
retain its special influence on the rays of light with whatever other elements it may be
combined ?
