The firs series of experiments were made with a view of determining the volume
occupied by iodide of silver at different temperatures between 0? and 300% C. Pre-
liminary experiments showed the nature of the changes to be examined. A mass of
iodide of silyer fused in a glass tube contracted while cooling 80 that it could be with-
drawn from the tube, but on returning it to the tube and permitting it to cool further,
it was 8een to suddenly change in colour and structure, and simultaneously to expand,
and violently break the tube,

Again, a thin spherical flask, which contained 10 cubic centims., was fitted with a
long capillary tube attached to an accurately ground stopper. Todide of silver was
placed in the flask, which was then filled with mercury, and the capillary tube attached,
forming in fact a large thermometer, the bulb of which contained, in addition to the
mercury, a quantity of iodide of silver. On heating such an arrangement the mercury
was observed to expand, until the contraction of the iodide exceeded the expansion of
the mereury, when on further heating, the column of mercury descended in the tube,
