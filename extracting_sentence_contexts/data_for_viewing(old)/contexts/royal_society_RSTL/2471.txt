ject in this inquiry was to prove that the blood possessed
within itself a principle of life, by which all these changes
were regulated.

By his direction I made the following experiment, which
proved that when frozen 'and- thawed it had undergone no
change.

Two. inches in length of the jugular vein distended with
blood and secured at each end by a ligature, when immersed
in a cooling mixture and frozen, was found after it was
thawed to remain fluid, and to coagulate on exposure like
recently drawn blood. From this fact, which is published
in his work on the blood, corroborated by many others, he
concluded that as the principle of life resided in the blood,
and no change was produced in that fluid by the act of
freezing, none were to be expected to arise from its action
