At T*/(ul?) ~ Tu) 1, as can be seen in figure 2, the tensile fragmentation rate behaves as a

lognormal, namely

where a’ is a dimensionless fitting constant, and 4) and t are fitting parameters with dimensions
of a frequency and a time, respectively. The values of these parameters reported in the caption
suggest that, while ro is of the order of the Kolmogorov time scale t,, the time t is 100 times
larger. This can be explained by the fact that Tmax(“02) ~ 7/16 and in turn, as seen in [25], typical
values of y are of the order of 0.1/t, leading to a factor of the order of 100.

To summarize this section, let us stress that tensile failure is here entirely prescribed by the
(intermittent) statistics of the velocity gradients. This is a stylized feature of our approach, and
provides a simplified framework to study fragmentation. Note that this assumption holds true
only for small fibres. When considering fibres larger than the Kolmogorov length scale, the
velocity gradient will not be uniform along the fibre. This implies in particular that the fibre could
be locally stretched and compressed at the same time and breaks in pieces of arbitrary sizes.

Also, it is important to notice that reaching large values of the tension requires y to locally
exceed a critical value that is « ¢~*. Tensile failure thus becomes rarer and rarer when fibres
become smaller. In addition, the daughter population is typically centred over the half of the
