urged, therefore, that it was quite irrelevant to apply one and the same composition to
- the final weights of animals fattened on foods differing 80 widely in this respect. It is
not denied, that, other things being equal, a highly nitrogenous food may give some
© tendency to a greater proportion of increase in frame and flesh ; but all observation would
lead to the conclusion, that, at least with animals fattening under ordinary conditions,
this would happen but in a very limited degree; in fact, by no means in anything like
a numerical proportion to the increased relation of the nitrogenous to the non-nitroge-
D nous constituents of the food. It has been found, indeed, that as our current fattening
= food-stuffs go, the increase in weight is more in proportion to the amount of digestible
S non-nitrogenous, or total dry organic substance, than to that of the nitrogenous com-
= pounds consumed. And, although with a high proportion of available non-nitrogenous
Ematter in the food there is a s0mewhat less tendeney to increase in frame, and a greater
Cone to fatten, yet animals which have been fed on very highly nitrogenous food, though
Sas a rule they have appeared to grow somewhat more, have nevertheless frequently been
extremely fat. Upon the whole then it is concluded, that the relation of the nitroge-
"Bnous matter to the fat, in the increase of the fattening animal, is by no means increased
Sin the degree which might be expected, by a considerable increase in the proportion of
nitrogenous to the non-nitrogenous compounds in the food. 'The proportion of the
