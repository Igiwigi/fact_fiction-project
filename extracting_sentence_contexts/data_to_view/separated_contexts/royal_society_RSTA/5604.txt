After the grid search, we set dropout rate, batch size,
learning rate, graph sequence length T as 0.5, 4, 0.001 and 7, respectively.

(b) Comparative baselines

To demonstrate the significance of our proposed approach, we compare with three categories of
baseline models, including compartment models, statistical models and neural network-based
methods.


— Compartment models

1. RobertWalraven-ESG [65] approximates the SEIR model with a mathematical
model that initialized from a particular skewed Gaussian distribution.

2. UCLA-SuEIR [18] further considers Untested/Unreported compartment than the
SEIR model based on the fact that exposure to the virus can also infect the
susceptible group in a certain period.

3. JHU_IDD-CovidSP [66] is a variant of the SEIR model which aims to generate more
realistic infectious periods by employing an Erlang distribution to model the time
in the Infected compartment.

— Statistical models

1. ARIMA [67] is an autoregressive moving average model and leverages the past
values to explain the given time series.

2.
