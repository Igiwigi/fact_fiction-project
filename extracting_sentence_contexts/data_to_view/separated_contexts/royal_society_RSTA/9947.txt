SCHUSTER ON THE PERIODICITIES OF SUNSPOTS. 91

as those of 1727, 1738, 1750, and 1761 are at a distance of neatly 11 years, the
differences between the calculated and observed times are always small. The two
maxima of 1649 and 1660 fit in well in a similar manner with the computed times. These facts are difficult to explain unless we believe in the permanency of the period. Having thus once more become a partial convert to that belief, I turned again to the
periodogram of 1750 to 1826 (curve B, fig. 2). The small peak showing at 114 years
I had, as explained, ascribed to the years 1800-1826, during which, as I then
thought, the 11-year period had come into existence.
