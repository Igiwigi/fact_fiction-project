a metabolic effect of the body temperature, once that is high enough, but is a reaction to air
temperature’. That is to say, the phenomenon was attributed to the direct action of tem-
perature on individuals, rather than to an indirect effect, through the gregarious relations
between individuals, on the movement-pattern of the mass.

In the later, full account of their observations, Gunn e¢ al. (1948) granted that the air
temperature might play a ‘permissive’ rather than a directly stimulating role in mass
departure, but they left the whole question open, as a problem of balancing the quantitative
importance of one factor against others, and said (p. 44): ‘gregariousness may not in itself
be a causal factor in migration, though it may very well be a modifying factor.’ If, however,
it be conceded that mass departure is by its very nature a gregarious act, then gregariousness
is thereby conceded to be a causal factor in swarm migration, and there is an a priori case for
the role of temperature and of other external influences being in fact permissive (see also
pp. 236-238).

Each gregaria locust is an individual capable of independent activity and differing some-
what from its fellows in its responsiveness to external stimuli, including those from its
fellows; and yet it is also a swarm member, capable of the closest integration into a larger

and itself provides, the same types of stimuli as they do. The actual behaviour of an indivi-
dual may be dominated hy either one of these two sides of its nature, according to how much
