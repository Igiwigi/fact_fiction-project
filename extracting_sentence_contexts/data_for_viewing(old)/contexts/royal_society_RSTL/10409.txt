— It will be convenient to describe first those changes which are visible from the
Sxterior, leaving to the next section an account of the corresponding internal changes

discovered in sections. In a third section a review of the facts will be given,
Su cog with a discussion of their significance.

The 8egmentation of the egg in Renilla is remarkable for the surprising amount of
individual variation of which it is capable. $0 great is this variation that it is safe to
8y that no two eggs ever develop in precisely the same way ; and although most of
the variations may be arranged in a definite series, ome of them are 80 irregular that
they seem to follow no definite law. No one indeed without actually following the
entire development of some of these eggs would suppose them capable of vormal
development. For a long time, in fact, I passed by some of the less usual forms as
due to abnormal or pathological changes, and only after repeated and careful sbudy
was able to convince myself that these peculiar embryos gave rise to active larve,

differing in no visible respect from those which had developed along the more usual
course. The matter appeared to me of 8uch interest and importance that T gladly
availed myself of the aid of two of my fellow workers ab the laboratory—Mr. H. L,
Os8BoRN and Dr. J. Merepita WirsoN—in order to 8tudy as completely as possible
the various forms of development. A. large number of eggs, produced at different
times by different individuals, were kept under continuous observation from the time
