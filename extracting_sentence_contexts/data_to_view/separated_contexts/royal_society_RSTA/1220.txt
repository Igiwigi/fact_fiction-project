In Love's * Elasticity ” an element of certain volume in the standard configuration is considered for
purposes of energy definition. Though physically the same, slight mathematical differences result. The
fact that the surface integral on p. 93 is taken over the surface of the solid in the standard configuration
implies a definition of stress with reference to the standard configuration, which prevents the stress-

components from being components of a tensor, (All references to Love's “ Elasticity ” refer to 4th ed. (Cambridge, 1927).)
