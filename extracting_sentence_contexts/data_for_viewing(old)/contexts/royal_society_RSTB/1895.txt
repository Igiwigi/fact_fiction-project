extend right up to the basement membrane, occupying the place of the future enamel as well as that
of the dentine; and it is these regularly arranged processes which cause the striew often described. If
the tooth be quite young, the processes are easily separated and seen in connection with the cell from
which they proceed, and they are frequently branched.

“Tf the tooth be left in ammonium bichromate for a few hours, or even in salt solution, the processes
as well as the cells can be more readily isolated. Indeed, on simply breaking through the basement
membrane, many of them escape and will be found outside. When the tooth becomes a little older,
and the basis thickens, the processes appear glued together by an intercellular matrix as it were, so
that the whole basis appears as one mass, the constituent parts of which are separated with difficulty,
and only by prolonged maceration in ammonium bichromate. But by this time, the deposition of
calcareous salts begins, and soon after, the differentiation of the mineralised portion into dentine and
enamel. The fact that the processes of the odontoblasts extend right up to the basement membrane,
occupying the place of the future enamel, admits of only one view with regard to the origin of the
enamel, and explains the existence of tubules which have often been described as extending into it, and
continuous with the dentinal tubules.”

From these and other data she concludes that ‘“ The enamel, like the dentine, owes its origin to the
odontoblasts, the presence of which, at an early stage, may be traced quite up to the outer edge,” this
generalisation being applied by her to the development of all enamel and not only to the tissue so
named in Plagiostomes and Ganoids.

She also writes : ‘‘ The whole tooth is formed under the basement membrane, and the entire growth is
from the side of the pulp. The calcification begins at the surface of the tooth, and there is no addition
made outside the part already calcified, no newly-formed layer of enamel appearing as a membrane on
