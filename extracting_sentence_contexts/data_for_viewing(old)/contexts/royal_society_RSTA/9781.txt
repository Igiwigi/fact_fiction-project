These melting-points are plotted in the diagram, fig. 6, and connected by the
upper curve P, of that diagram. The curve P, is not shown in the diagram as it
runs very close and parallel to P,.

The difference between the pressures P, and P, is about 20 kg./cem.*, and the
amount of super-cooling necessary to reach the part C of the crystallization-velocity
curve as shown in fig. 5, where the velocity of crystallization attains large values and
growth-structures also appear, is thus only about one degree in the case of CBr,—one
degree on the melting-point curve corresponding to 20 kg./em.%. From the fact that
the difference between the values P, and P, does not change at higher pressure, it
may be concluded that pressure does not influence the degree of super-cooling which
is necessary in order that growth-structures may be produced, The curves showing
the velocity of crystallization in its dependence on the degree of super-cooling
(diagram, fig. 5) will, therefore, be similar in shape at all pressures, although the
absolute value of the velocity at corresponding degrees of super-cooling may vary
with the pressure.

(2) Transition-point Determinations—When the molten carbon tetrabromide is
cooled between glass plates it first crystallizes in isotropic crystals, and on further
cooling a crystallization of the anisotropic erystal modification suddenly starts. The
anisotropic crystallization begins usually from one or from a few points at the border
