We define the matrix
product state showing two possible ways to build it. The first one is in the spirit of DMRG
method of White [3], based on the Schmidt decomposition of a quantum state. The second one,
the original point of view, comes from the fact that the matrices can be seen as a bond between the
neighbour sites in a chain. The latter approach springs from the valence bond model introduced
by Affleck et al. [70] and generalized by Fannes et al. [71]. The link between the two points of view
has been unveiled by Ostlund & Rommer [6].
