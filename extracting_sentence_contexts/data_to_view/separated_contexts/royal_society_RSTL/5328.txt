* Originally given by myself in the London and Edinburgh Philosophical Magazine, as long ago as 1839 or
1840; and some years subsequently in unconsciousness of that fact, reproduced by my friend Mr. CarLey, to
whom the method is sometimes erroneously ascribed, and who arrived at the same equations by an entirely

different circle of reasoning.

If we equate the right-hand members of (e+2;) of the above equations: to-zero;
and then eliminate dialytically the several -powers of -@ from 2"***** to a'* (both
inclusive), the result of this process will evidently be: of (e+:) dimensions in respect
of the coefficients in V, and of : dimensions in respect of the coefficients in U; and of
the degree a” in it will also be of the form

(A+Ba+...LYv”)U+(F+Gr+...+Qr*="),
and by virtue of art. (2.) must consequently be the th simplified residue to the
system U, V. Art. (10.).
