If using power was good, then using more power was better. But not all Americans were using it equally. In fact, some were not using it at all. Electricity
generation in the USA was mostly the work of entrepreneurs such as Thomas Edison and
George Westinghouse (who manufactured generators and other necessary equipment in for-profit
enterprises) and private utilities that used that equipment to produce and sell electricity as a


commodity. This model proved highly successful in urban areas, but rural areas were another
matter [26-28].
