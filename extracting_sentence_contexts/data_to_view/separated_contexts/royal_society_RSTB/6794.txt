The
crystals were insoluble in petroleum ether, but very soluble in methanol and gave an
orange solution in carbon disulphide with two absorption bands at 516 (H) to 514 mu
(HF) and at 483 (H) to 481 my ($). These values are close to those for a number of
xanthophyll pigments such as sulcatoxanthin, zeaxanthin, petaloxanthin and cynthia-
xanthin. The fact that the pigment is entirely hypophasic in 90 % methanol against
petroleum ether differentiates it from cryptoxanthin. In one case a second xantho-
phyllic pigment was obtained which gave an orange solution in carbon disulphide
with bands at 509-510 and 478-481 my (HF) which are close to the bands of fuco-
xanthin or lutein. These observations show that the red animals store large quantities of the esters of
the acidic carotenoid metridene, and in some cases small amounts of astacene, caro-
tenes and xanthophylls with their esters: while among the yellower members of this
series carotenes and various xanthophyllic carotenoids may attain much larger
quantity.
