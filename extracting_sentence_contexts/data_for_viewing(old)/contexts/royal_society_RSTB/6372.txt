first place, the curved process of the angular in Cynodonts is undoubtedly the homo-
logue of the outer plate of the angular which we can trace up from the Dinoceph-
alians, and we may be perfectly certain that this outer plate did not support the
tympanic membrane in Dinocephalians, Therocephalians, Anomodonts, or Gorgonop-
sians. Then it seems impossible to conceive of the mandible opening widely and
closing and with every movement carrying the tympanic membrane into a different
position. But if these arguments were not convincing we now have the certainty that


STRUCTURE OF THE SKULL IN THEROCEPHALIA 41

in the Therocephalians at least the tympanic membrane was attached to the squa-
mosal and the quadrate, and not in any way to the jaw. In fact, the position of the
membrane in the Therocephalian is exactly where I assumed it must be, in my 1912
paper. We thus have a new definite step in the advancement of our knowledge.

The discovery of the extra-stapedial is a second and equally important advance.
But it raises a new problemâ€”how the extra-stapedial disappeared and had its place
taken by a process of the articular. Unfortunately, the condition of the auditory
apparatus is less satisfactorily known in the Anomodonts, the Gorgonopsians, and the
Cynodonts than in the Therocephalians. All these groups have a fairly massive
stapes as a rule, and so far no evidence of any extra-stapedial has been detected.
Possibly a cartilaginous extra-stapedial has been present.

When the jaw had formed its new articulation between the dentary and the
