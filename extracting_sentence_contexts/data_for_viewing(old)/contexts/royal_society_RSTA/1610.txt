Speaking loosely, we may say that a common feature of the topological techniques in
mathematical analysis and dynamical systems theory is that they derive information about the
problem under consideration (be it some sort of equation, inequality, inclusion or estimate) from
the topological structure of the space where the problem lives or of the operators involved. As an
illustration of this fact one may consider the well-known Misiurewicz-Przytycki theorem that
establishes a lower bound for the topological entropy of a C! self map of a smooth compact
orientable manifold in terms of the topological degree of this map! (e.g. [29]). Usually, it pays
to place the problems in a wisely chosen space. A case in point is [30] where the classical Brouwer
degree is applied to the study of the eigenvalue problem for square real matrices yielding a
result about global continuation in nonlinear spectral theory that, in turn, can be applied to a
Rabinowitz-type global continuation property of the solutions of a perturbed motion equation
with friction.

A broad but somewhat fuzzy distinction can be made between two groups of topological tools.
One class consists of those devices that provide existence results directly on the grounds of how
the involved functions interact with the topology of the space they operate upon; examples in
this group are Brouwer or Schauder or Kakutani fixed point theorems [22,31,32], the Wazewski
