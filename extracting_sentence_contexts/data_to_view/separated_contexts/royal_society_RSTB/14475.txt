In addition to not requiring an internal estimate of cue
variability, the IC theory and the Vector Sum model have
also a theoretical advantage over probabilistic theories and
the MLE model. Probabilistic theories need to clarify how
the visual system has learnt either through evolution or
during development to associate the visual input to the accu-
rate geometrical description of the viewed objects. In fact, the
brain has no way to access the geometrical structure of the
outside world since all information comes through our inher-
ently ambiguous proximal sense data. The IC theory, instead,
is based on the conjecture that the visual system ‘discovers’
(ontogenetically of phylogenetically) distal properties of
objects from the intrinsic relationships existing among inde-
pendent image cues. In principle, the correlation among
these cues enables the bootstrapping of individual depth
modules so as to produce outputs that are linearly related to
distal properties.
