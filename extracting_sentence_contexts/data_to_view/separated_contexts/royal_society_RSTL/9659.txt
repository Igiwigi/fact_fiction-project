But the
question suggests itself—whether something may nob be also due to the position of the
plot as above referred to, and something possibly also to an unknown difference in the
character of the 80il and subsoil? Finally, ib must not be overlooked that if the
combination of the conditions of manure, soil, and local cireumstances, was more favour-
able to certain freer-growing species, these, as a coincident of the character of freer
growth, would necessarily be able to avail themselves more than others could do, of the
same 8upplies within the 8oil. In fact, something is to be attributed to the greater
powers of food-collection of the species favoured, as well as to the somewhat increased
supplies by manure. With an increased faculty to take up food, more of it is taken
up than would result from the mere increase of supply ; that is, more than would be the
cage were one and the same species, with one and the same habit and functional capacity,
growing on the two differently manured plots.

9. 800 lbs. Ammonta-Salts, and Mixed Mineral Manure containing Potass ;
Plots 11-1 and 11-2.

'The next illustrations show the effects of a cousiderably increased supply of amumonia-
salts, used in conjunction with the same mixed mineral manure, including potass, as on
plot 9.
