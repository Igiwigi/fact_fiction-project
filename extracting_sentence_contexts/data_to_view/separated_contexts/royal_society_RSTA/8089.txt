But so many approximations are involved in the application of Fresnex’s theory,
that an outstanding event in the history of diffraction theory was the discovery of the
exact solution for waves impinging upon a semi-infinite plane. This problem constitutes the only one in diffraction theory which has been solved
completely in a comparatively simple form. It is a special case of the wedge problem,
the successful treatment of which is due to the fact that there are no dimensions con-
cerned which bear a relation to the wave-length of the incident disturbance. The
solution of the problem is due to the labours of a number of mathematicians, among
whom Porncaré (‘Acta Math.’ vol. 16, p. 297 (1892-3) ), SommerrEeLD (“ Math. Theorie der Diffraction,” ‘Math.
