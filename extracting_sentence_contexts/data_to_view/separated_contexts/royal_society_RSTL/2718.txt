But if the diffused polarity be of an oval form, and if the greater axis of the oval on
one side of the lens be perpendicular to the same axis on the other side, we may then
safely infer that the fibres are related, as in the lens of the salmon, to two septa at
each extremity of the axis of vision. When these methods fail, the ambiguity may
sometimes be remoyed by boiling the lenses, and observing the manner in which
they crack at the poles. From a too hasty generalization of a small number of facts, LezUweExnork main-
tained that all fishes and birds have two short septa ; and M. SaTT16* has advanced the
same opinion in reference to fishes, and committed the additional mistake of making
every part of the fibres lie in the same plane. Dr.
