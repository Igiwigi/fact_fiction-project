They were only indifferently preserved,
and were made rather worse through my efforts to work out their structure by maceration. They are in the collection of the Geological Survey of Greenland at Copenhagen. I have, however, re-examined all the preparations of cuticles, and while I can confirm
most of what I previously stated, certain facts are now recognized for the first time and my
account is corrected. I had supposed that the lateral organs were originally cup-shaped. This was a mistake; one of the preparations (2881) shows the lateral edge of a valve though
this feature was missed.
