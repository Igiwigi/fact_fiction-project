and the lymphatics of the superficial ventral system passes into a large reservoir in the
centre of the thyroid body. From this reservoir it is conveyed directly to the heart. In Scorpenichthys ALLEN (1) was unable to demonstrate any direct connection between
the pharyngeal portion of the ventral lymphatic system and the veins, though the fact
that injection thrown into these lymphatics passed into the inferior jugular vein led
him to assume that there must be some natural communication between the two. In Lophius this question is not open to doubt, for there is an important open and
direct connection between the thyroid sinus and a vein that I take to be the represen-
tative of the inferior jugular. It will be remembered that in describing the cavity within the thyroid, reference
was made (p. 11) to the reflexion of the dorsal wall of this lymph sinus above the bifur-
cation of the ventral aorta, to form a posteriorly directed recess that led into a
membranous vessel situated upon the dorsal surface of the pericardium.
