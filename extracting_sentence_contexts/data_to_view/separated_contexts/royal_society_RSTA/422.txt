Figure 8 shows two SPAD
implementations, where the guard ring was ineffective (figure 8a,c) and effective (figure 8b,d)
to prevent PEB. A technique called light emission test (LET) enables one to visualize the location of avalanches
occurring in a period of time. The technique uses the fact that impact ionization generates
photons, with a certain probability, and thus avalanche discharges can be optically identified. Figure 8 shows an LET on two different devices in which PEB suppression was, respectively,
unsuccessful and successful. Several techniques exist to implement PEB prevention.
