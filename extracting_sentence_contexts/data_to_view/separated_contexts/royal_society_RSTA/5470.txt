Water migration was also visible
from the sulfur-oxygen in water RDFs and CNs, especially for the strongest electric field. While
the location of the peak did not vary, the magnitude of the peak decreased due to the electric
field. This was potentially due to the fact that some of the water molecules migrated along
with counterions, in contrast to the vast majority that maintained their relative arrangement
with respect to the sulfonate groups. A similar behaviour was captured by the oxygen-oxygen
RDFs and CNs for water molecules. With respect to sodium, the sulfur-sodium RDFs were
characterized by two peaks up to small values of the electric field.
