orange is produced, which s0on passes into bright yellow.

6. The alkaline s0lutions may be evaporated nearly to dry-
ness without Iosing their red colours; during the evaporation
of the ammoniacal solution, the alkali flies off, and a brown+
red s0lution of the colouring matter in water remains.

108 Mr, W. Braxpe's Chemical Researches on the Blood,

Having ascertained the above facts respecting the colouring
principle of the blood, I next proceeded to examine how far
it was susceptible of entering into those combinations which
are peculiar to other varieties of colouring matter.

These experiments I shall detail in the order in which they
were made,

1. Some pure alumine was added to a concentrated aqueous
solution of the colouring matter of the blood, and after twenty-
four hours the mixture, which had" been frequently agitated
during that period, was poured upon a filter, and the residuum
washed with hot distilled water. f
