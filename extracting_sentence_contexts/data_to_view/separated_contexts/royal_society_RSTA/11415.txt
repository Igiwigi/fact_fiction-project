448 PROFESSOR K. PEARSON AND MISS A. LEE ON THE DISTRIBUTION

An examination of these lists seems to show that, even allowing for some dis-
turbances in the Stonyhurst, Llandudno, and Margate returns, there is no
geographical fact closely represented by range above the mode thus measured. There are but few and small changes introduced into the order of stations, whether
we consider H, — M, or H, only. But H, differs so widely from H, that we must
consider one or other of them as of little value in the determination of the nature
of the frequency above the mode, In general the range above the mode dealt with
in this manner appears to be more closely correlated with local conditions than with
geographical position.
