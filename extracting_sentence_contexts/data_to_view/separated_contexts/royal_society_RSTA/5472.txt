x 15°5 = ‘013675,
and : a X 15°5 = ‘013799, taking B = ‘000008. We have then Piss = Po X 1:018799. The factor 1-013799 was used in calculating the specific resistance at 0° C. from
that at 15°°5 C.
The value of «,;.; above given is obtained from (ec), correction being similarly made
for the fact that the formula applies to mercury in a glass tube. * Mactxop and CrarKs, ‘ Phil. Trans.,’ 1880.
