When referring to the transition realms of the
cortex it was stated that the passage of one form into that of another is never abrupt ;
the change is a gradual one, and hence no exact boundary line can be drawn betwixt
the clustered cells of the fourth layer in the limbic lobe and the solitary elements of
the same layer in the adjacent parietal gyri, Vertical sections taken through these
adjacent conyolutions constantly exhibit the grouped arrangement overstepping the
boundary of the crucial suleus and spreading towards the summit of the uppermost
parietal convolution, but thinning out into the stratiform or solitary arrangement
beyond. On the other hand, numerous nests of these game elements occupy that
aspect of the third parietal gyrus which dips into the inter-parietal sulens. Bearing
this fact in mind, we may state that the crucial and inter-parietal sulci roughly map
out the boundary lines between two highly characteristic formations—the clustered
and the solitary ganglionic series. We will now deal with the several regions alluded
to seriatim, and describe the local variations in the conformation of the mid-regions of
the cortex in—1, the limbic lobe ; 2, frontal lobe ; 3, parietal lobe.

1. The great limbic lobe —We hall limit our examination to the antero-superior
are of this lobe, or the convolution of the corpus callosum, and first inquire into the special
arrangement; of the fourth layer of the cortex in that anterior portion which lies in
front of the 8b-parietal 8nlcus, and whose limits extend from the commencement of
the crucial sulcus to the internal root of the olfactory nerve, fig. 1 (6-19).
