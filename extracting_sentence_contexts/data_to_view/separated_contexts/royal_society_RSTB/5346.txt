The latter, after receiving spermatozoa from the
males, enter frit-fly larvee and in this way the cycle of growth within the host is
carried on. So far the events described above have been determined for the stem and panicle
generations of flies, but it is evident that an exactly similar cycle must be passed through
in the case of the overwintering generation on grass. That this is so is proved by the
fact that the first worms found by the writer in oat stems were ensheathed larvee under-
going their last two moults, and these must have come from parasitised flies of the over-
wintering generation. The accompanying diagram (text-fig. 1) has been drawn to illustrate the life-history
of the fly and the parasite. SrructuRE AND DEVELOPMENT.
