inals of a HoLTz machine (Plate 26, fig. 8), and an air-spark be introduced into

4 circuit, the only effect that is produced upon the phosphorescence is that it grows
-Srighter, and is sometimes lightly altered in its position and distribution. Sub-
Ftantially, the phenomenon remains the 8ame as before the introduction of the air-
Spark, thus showing that the intermittence of the discharge does not prevent the
:Aegative pole from sending off the streams of molecules to which this phosphorescence
/=s due, but, on the contrary, favours its 80 doing. This is in accordance with what
Sas already been stated in Section XV LI.

To the eye the phosphorescence of the intermittent or sensitive discharge is just as
-Sontinuous as that of the continuous discharge. But this is easily proved to be a
-Qnere optical effect, and that the phosphorescence is, in fact, like the discharge itself,
-antermittent. To demonstrate this, ib is only necessary to take a revolving mirror
Ad examine the tube through a narrow slit in the ordinary way. Whether there be
© positive or a negative air-spark it will be found that the green luminosity is inter-
» mittent. If the air-spark be large a very small velocity of rotation will show the green
> lines which are the images of the lit clearly separated by dark bands ; and with an
© increased velocity of rotation the intermittence can clearly be shown even when the
—air-spark is very 8mall.

Ti -/It might, be thought that since phosphorescence is supposed to last for a short time

» after the excitement which causes it has ceased, the green light would be continuous
