The phenomenon
appears to us to be an end or involution phase, rather than a transition phase. We
are aware that, amongst the fungi, more than one sclerotioid process is described ; but
whether anything analogous to the above occurs we are unable, from want of expe-
rience, to state. It appears, however, to be a fact that parasitic sclerotia do occur,
in which remains of the tissue of the plant host may be seen. Dr BAry* mentions
that Corvat points this out in the case of Peziza sclerotiorum, but we have not
been able to find where he makes the statement in his atlas. Dr Bary himself
figures Sclerotinia Fuckeliana, containing the cell d√©bris of its vine-leaf host.
