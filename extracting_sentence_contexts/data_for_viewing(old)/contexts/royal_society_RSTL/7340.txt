correction required in R.A. or P.D.

29 h. 13; IL 241=1L 243. In PT. the determining # is omitted, and in the state-
ment of the places of these nebulz, as well as of II. 239, 240, 242, and IIL 199,
there is much confusion, for the correction of which see the list of errata sub-
joined. Awyers has threaded the intricacies of this maze with singular felicity,
but has been misled in. the case of IT. 243 into assigning to it a totally erro-
neous place (22Â» 48" R.A., 73% 37' P.D. 1830), and, in consequence, has not per-
ceived its identity with II. 241.

78 IL. 3. Auwers makes the P.D. of this neb. (1830)=99* 32', from P.T., which
Places it 2*+ n of 17 Ceti, C.H. makes it 1*5V 2 of the same star, or for 1830,
99% 4, Tn fact H. has two observations of it, neither of them more than eye-
drafts with neighbouring stars, and the P.D. is concluded graphically by C.H.
from these diagrams.

88 III. 876. The P.D. of Auwwers (81? 16') is 1? wrong. The place given in P.T. is
1*48' n of 51 Piscium; 80 also in Register (H. 2296).

119 Awy. N. 4=D'Arr. 6. The place given is that brought up from D'Arrest's obser-
vations, the R.A. being set down only roughly in Auy.

132 h. 57=V. 20. Once looked for by Lord Rosse and not seen. Having been
observed both by H. and h., there can be no doubt of its existence.
