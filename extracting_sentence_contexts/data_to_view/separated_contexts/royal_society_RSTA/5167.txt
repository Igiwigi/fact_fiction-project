The objective of Climate
Engineering (hereafter CE, but also referred to as
‘Geoengineering’, and sometimes as ‘Solar Radiation
consequences of deliberately altering the Management’) is to offset the warming and some other
Earth's energy budget’. climate consequences that would otherwise result from
increasing greenhouse gas concentrations by reducing
the amount of sunlight reaching the Earth’s surface or
by increasing the outward transmission of long-wave
