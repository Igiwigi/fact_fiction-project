However, careful attention needs to be paid to knowledge transfer, and we
should learn from some of the mistakes encountered when RANS was introduced
into industry, and an awareness of the limitations of LES is needed. For this
purpose Hutton (2009) rightly advocates the development of best practices
guidelines. However, these should not detract from the fact that the safe use o:
LES needs a level of fundamental understanding. Again, LES should be seen as a complementary tool to experiments, and wil
not, in the foreseeable future, replace testing, and industrial practitioners should
ye aware of those limits. Indeed, a closer collaboration between experimentalists
and numericists is required both for developing accurate tools and for using them
o their full potential.
