i. Preparation of Hydrogen.—The preparation of hydrogen and its occlusion in
palladium have been fully described in the previous paper.t The only alterations I
introduced in the arrangement of the apparatus were these :—Four phosphorus
pentoxide drying tubes instead of three were used, and a water reservoir was attached
to one arm of the electrolysis vessel. The whole apparatus, including the bulb
containing palladium, was made of boro-silicate glass.

In the preparation of the hydrogen, the gas passed through two U tubes containing
platinised pumice, kept at 400° C., instead of 220° C., to remove any oxygen diffusing
from the + electrode.

The purity of the hydrogen is evidenced by the fact that the residual gases from
the combustion of all the hydrogen—about 154 grammes—burnt in my eight
experiments and of the corresponding weight of chlorine yielded less than half a cubic
centimetre of nitrogen. If it be assumed that all this nitrogen came from the
hydrogenised palladium bulb (which is not likely), the maximum weight of nitrogen
present in the hydrogen was 1 part in 25,000.

2. The Palladium Bulb.—The palladium bulb, of which a sketch is given in fig. 1,
differed little from that described in the former paper. It was made of boro-silicate
glass, and terminated, not in a jet, but in the inner portion of a ground joint.
