A lava dome collapse can be triggered by various events, for example heavy
rainfall [18], seismicity [19] and pressurization. Determining the thickness of the low-density
crust is crucial because it is one of the key factors that controls the collapse magnitude. This
is due to the fact that erosion of the crust may expose the hot and dense core, leading to
an explosive event [17]. If muographic visualization of the internal structure of growing lava
domes is resolved within a few hours, this helps to provide evidence of the talus thickness
and, therefore, repeated measurements would provide direct information on its evolution that
might be essential to facilitate risk mitigation of dome collapses. Tanaka [9] demonstrated that
simplified, multidirectional muographic images inside the Heisei-Shinzan lava dome could be
obtained within this level of observation time by airborne muography [9].

(b) Vulcanian explosions

Because the individual volume of silicic volcanoes is relatively large in general, usually only the
top part can be inspected with muography.
