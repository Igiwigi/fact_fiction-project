2. That if the mammalian pterygoid is really homologous with the reptilian
pterygoid, then it is necessary to find a new homology for the Echidna pterygoid.
If that bone be the ectopterygoid (an obvious first idea), then it must have changed
its position enormously.

Neither of these objections is a very powerful one. If Broomâ€™s idea that the
independently developed exterior part of the ala temporalis is homologous with the
pars palatina of the palato-quadrate cartilage is correct, and no evidence has been
brought forward against this view, then the pterygoid of Ornithorhynchus develops
in close proximity to the palato-quadrate cartilage, as it should do. Even if this
view be not upheld by further discussion, we have the fact which I have pointed out
above, that in all the advanced Therapsids of South Africa, which we know, as surely
as we know anything in phylogeny, to be related to the ancestor of the mammals,
the pterygoids invariably cover the whole lower surface of the basipterygoid
processes, which are, of course, part of the neural cranium, Even in the living
Chelonia the pterygoids spread inwards under the lower surface of the basal plate.

The discovery of a new homology for the Echidna pterygoid presents no difficulty.
The fact that, according to ScHULMANN, a rudimentary muscle connects the Echidna
pterygoid of Ornithorhynchus with the sphenoidal and_petrosal region, shows, as
Gaupr has pointed out, that the bone was originally free. It must therefore, from
its general relations, be some bone belonging to the palato-quadrate series. If the
mammalian pterygoid be really the true reptilian pterygoid, it must be either the
