other traces to best allocate time for. From a volume crime
perspective, this opens the possibility of monitoring the
nature of offences, and detection of emerging series or
trends that can be realized as they happen, not simply in
hindsight, as current practice and information management
prohibits. The possibilities appear endless, ‘only’ limited by
the capacity of organizations to manage the exponential
amount of data available.

More broadly, blurring the boundaries between the scene
and the specialized laboratory is a shift that may partly solve
the anomaly expressed by DeForest [32] above, or at least
improve it in some ways. In fact, this shift may catalyse a
two-way engagement:

(1) scientists who, by leaving the traditional laboratory, may
be more directly engaged in the field and integrated with
the other actors in the security system; and

(2) policing and security in general who, by having a more
direct access to the detection, analysis and use of foren-
sic case data, may be more pro-actively connected to
forensic science.

This shift would be positive as it reconnects forensic science
