V. DER
a Korx’s law had reference chiefly to the distribution of the nerve trunks of limb-
g plexuses, and was not, by v. per Korx, applied to the distribution of pure
§ spinal nerves. That in the trunk the skin overlying a muscle is supplied with
B sensation by the same spinal nerve as that supplying the motor innervation
Sto the muscle is no doubt generally the case. But a fact of greater constancy
§ is that between the anterior and posterior borders of the skin-field of a posterior root,
P the mid-point lies posterior to the mid-point of the muscular field of the anterior
sproot. The cutaneous field of the sensory root lies somewhat further back than
= does the muscular field of the motor root. And this obliquity of mutual
s relationship becomes greater as the trunk is followed backwards.
