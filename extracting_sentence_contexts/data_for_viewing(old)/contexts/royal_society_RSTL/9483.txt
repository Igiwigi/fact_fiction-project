The only other course was to look to firsb principles for the evidence wanting to
establish the truth of the assumption. This I had attempted.

Obviously the first step in this direction was to examine the values of U, V, W as
determined by the case of gas at varying temperature and umform pressure. This
showed that if a plane be supposed to be moving through the gas with velocities U, V, WE
then, measured with respect to the moving plane, the aggregate momenta carried from
opposite 8ides across the plane are equal.

This fact appeared pointed, but the exact point of it was not at onee obvious, nor
did it fully occur to me until I had completed the investigation founded as already
described on the agsumption.

Subsequently, however, working at the subject from the other end, 80 to speak, I
came to see that whatever might be the action between the molecules, the probable
effect of encounters in a varying gas would not tend to reduce the molecules after en-
counter to the same state as those of a uniform gas moving with the mean component
velocities of the varying gas, but to a uniform gas moving with the halves of the
mean component velocities of all the molecules which cross a unit of s8urface in @ unit
of timeâ€”whach pass through an element in a unit of time.

I had no till then apprehended, nor do I know that ib has anywhere been pointed
