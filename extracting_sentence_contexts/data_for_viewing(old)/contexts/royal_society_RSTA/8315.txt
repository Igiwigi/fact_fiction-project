If we know the properties of the vertex figure of IT,, and the number of vertices of II,,,
we can thus obtain the number of II,’s which have (°|!) vertices.

Since the vertices of a polytope correspond to the bounding figures of its reciprocal,
the reciprocal of I1,, has only one kind of bounding figure, and this bounding figure is
the reciprocal of II,,1,, (with respect to an (m— 1)-dimensional sphere-analogue
concentric with I,,_;,). This agrees with the fact that (by 1.35) () <1) and ("| m—1,1)
are reciprocal properties if s +-s’ = m — 2.

2.6. If I,-1.1 happens to be uniform, its vertex figure is denoted by II,,-2,, and is
called the “second vertex figure” of II, Extending this idea: if Ma-wstu-1
uniform, its vertex figure II,,_,,, is called the “ uth vertex figure * of II,,. It follows
that I,,-,,, is the (w—v)th vertex figure of II,,.,,., and that the uniformity of
Tl,,-.+1,u-1 implies the existence of I,,_,., for all vsu.  M,,,9 must be taken to
