If the first be true, the network must be terminal, and impressions must be oral
along the fibre, of which the plexus is but the terminal expansion, direct from peri-
phery to centre. If the second arrangement is correct, the network forms a part of a
continuous circuit or of continuous circuits. I believe the division of the nerves at the
base of the papilla, already adverted to, is alone sufficient to justify us in accepting the
second conclusion as the more probable ; but when this fact is considered with reference
to those which IT have adduced in my paper published in the © Transactions * for 1863,
and that, in the © Proceedings? for June 1864, and the observations published in several
papers in vols. 11., iii., and iv. of my © Archives,” and in the Croonian Lecture for 1865,
T think the general view in favour of complete circuits is the only one which the-anato-
mical facts render tenable. 'The mode of branching and division of trunks and indiyidual
fibres is represented in Plate XXII. figs. 20, 21, 22, 23. From the number and size of the nervye-fibres constituting the bundle in the centre of
the papilla, we should infer that the finest ramifications resulting from the subdivision
of these branches would be very numerous, since it has been shown that the fine fibres
resulting from the subdivision of a single dark-bordered fibre in the frog's bladder,
palate, skin, and muscle, constitute plexuses or networks which pass over a very extended
area. The mode of formation of a nerve-plexus is represented in Plate XXII. figs. 11
& 14.
