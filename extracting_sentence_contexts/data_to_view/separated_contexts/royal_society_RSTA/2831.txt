As @ is so small and varies so little it can scarcely be a function of the atomic weight. The atomic volumes of the elements are much more even and it may be a function of
them as is the case with the p-sequence. In fact, in the case of the alkalies, the a
are not far from being proportional to v, 2v, 2v, 3v, for the four elements considered,
but the data are so inexact and uncertain that it seems not worth while to undertake
an exhaustive numerical discussion. We do not know that the chief lines of these sets are those depending on m = 3. Tf lines exist depending on m = 2 they would all be in extremest red, in fact with
wave-lengths comparable with those of electro-magnetic waves capable of being
experimentally excited, and it is possible that VF (2) might be the same for all low
melting-point elements and as for He (see [I.]).
