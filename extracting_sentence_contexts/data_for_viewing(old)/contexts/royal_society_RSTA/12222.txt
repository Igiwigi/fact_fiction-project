With mixtures of hydrogen and carbonic oxide the formula is found to hold good.
BerrHetor explains this by saying that “ the hydrogen communicates to the carbonic
oxide a law of detonation analogous to its own.”

The general concordance between the observed velocities and the calculated rate of
translation of the molecules shows, according to BrerTHeEtor, that, dissociation plays
but a small part in these phenomena, perhaps because of the high pressure developed :
a result which is confirmed by the fact that the velocities are found to be independent
of the pressure.

A comparison is next made between the rates of explosion of ‘“ isomeric mixtures,”
z.¢., mixtures of different gases which yield the same products of combustion. For
instance, the rate of explosion of marsh gas and oxygen is compared with the rate of
explosion of a mixture of ethylene, hydrogen, and oxygen yielding identical products ;
the object being to eliminate the influence of the individual gases burnt. ‘The same
conclusions are drawn.
