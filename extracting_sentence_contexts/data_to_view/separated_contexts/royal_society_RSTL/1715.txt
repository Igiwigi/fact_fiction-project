Fig. 2, shows the gall bladder upon the same scale, laid
open, as well as the large duct leading to the gut, till it pene-
trates through its coats. These parts are distinct from the liver, lying directly be-
hind the duodenum, and connected to it by cellular membrane ;
the duct by which the bile is brought to this reservoir is
also shown. Some curious facts respecting the walrus and seal, &c. 241

Plate VIII. represents the placenta of the seal, in which
there are several peculiarities ; upon a scale of half an inch
to an inch : the foetal surface of the placenta only is exposed. The funis is nine inches long, but the blood vessels are
not twisted on one another as is common in quadrupeds ;
and after passing three inches from the navel of the foetus,
the vein divides into two branches, At six inches the arteries
and veins sub-divide $0 as to form three distinct chords, and
these, instead of going directly into the substance of the pla-
centa, have doublings of membrane surrounding them in form
of mesenteries, in which their branches are inclosed ; and
these terminate in the placenta, rendering the surface very
vascular. This surface of the placenta has a lobulated appearance :
but the fissures do not extend to the maternal surface, which
has throughout a granulated appearance.
