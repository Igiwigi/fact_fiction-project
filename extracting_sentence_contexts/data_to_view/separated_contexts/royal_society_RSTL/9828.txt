The ribs
are short and stout. Only a few fragments of the limbs have been found ; they would seem to have been
less developed than in Zylonomus, and perhaps this animal was less gifted with
powers of walking on land than any of the other Microsauria. This would accord
with the fact that its bones are much scattered, and occur chiefly in sandy layers, as if
introduced in times of rain or of partial inundation. o

Some fragments indicate thoracic plates, and there are numerous abdominal scales of
oval form. Above, the body appears to have been clothed with small tubercles and
horny scales, and to have had cuticular pendants like those of Dendrerpeton. In a large specimen the mandible measures 2:2 centimetres, the femur 2 centimetres,

and a rib the xame.
