Series (i.). Hampden Spanish Chestnuts.

T had hoped to get records for 26 leaves from each of 100 trees from the splendid
chestnut avenue at Hampden House, but it provided records for some 60 trees only.
These I owe to Miss Lina Ecxensrery. I was able to add by diligent search
about 25 additional trees from the same neighbourhood, All these were large
forest trees of splendid growth. In order to make the number up to 100, some 15
additional trees were added, these being all large old trees from other neighbour-
hoods. I look upon this series as a fairly homogeneous one, representing the degree
of resemblance between leaves on fully developed forest trees. The counting of the
veins on this series was undertaken by Miss C. D. Fawcerrr, B.Sc., and the
tabulating and numerical reduction by Dr. Lez. Both these processes involved
an immense amount of labour, in fact days and days of careful and fatiguing work.

* The leaves were all gathered in the autumn, towards the fall.

Series (ii). Mixed Spanish Chestnuts.

My second series consists of 26 leaves from each of 104 trees. These were
gathered in a variety of neighbourhoods, Many of these were young trees.
In the case of nearly 50 sets, the trees were pollards from old stumps with about
15 yearsâ€™ growth; some of the others were from fine old trees, and as a result
