(b) Generating patient-specific heart models

Bajaj & Goswami (2008) explore a solution to the problem of constructing
good finite-element and boundary-element models of the human heart from high-
resolution computer tomography (CT) imaging data. In fact, the quality of
patient data, even if acquired with state-of-the-art CT hardware, is not sufficient
to produce satisfactorily meshed models of the anatomy and to perform further
simulation for diagnostic purposes. Imaging is therefore only the initial step of
a complex computational pipeline, needed to generate a robust and spatially
realistic mesh model of a patientâ€™s heart (figure 8). Rough imaging data are first put through an image processing pipeline to
enhance their quality.
