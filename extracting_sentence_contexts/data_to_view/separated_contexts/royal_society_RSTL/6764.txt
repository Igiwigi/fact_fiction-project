In the only case in which we have been able to try it among liquid elements, namely
terbromide of phosphorus, the result was pretty near; but there is no doubt that
chemical combination often greatly changes the optical as it does the other properties
of elementary bodies. Yet it is quite conceivable that an element may retain a specific influence on the
rays of light through many if not all its compounds; and this view certainly finds some
support in our experiments. Witness the fact of the great increase both of refraction
and dispersion caused by the addition of nitrogen, whether combined with oxygen or
not, to compounds of carbon and hydrogen (ee Appendix I., Nos. 32, 52-99, 97-62,
75, 76). But when we look more narrowly at the numbers, we find this general perma-
nence of special optical properties subject to much modification. Thus the difference in
the optical properties of some isomeric bodies shows that such a generalizatien cannot
be strictly true.
