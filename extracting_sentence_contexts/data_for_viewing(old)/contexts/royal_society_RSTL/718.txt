when heated. The noise- is similar to that occasioned by firing
an equal quantity of gunpowder, and accordingly the 'explo-
Sion is attended with no marks of violence unless occasioned
by close confinement. The heat requisite for this purpose is
barely sufficient to melt bismuth, consequently is about 500? of
FAnRENHEIT. The light produced is proportionally feeble, and
can only be seen in the absence of all other light.

In endeavouring to dissolve a piece of palladium in strong
colourless nitric acid for the purpose of forming the detonating
prussiate, I found: that, although the acid shortly acquired a red
colour surrounding the metal, the action. of the acid was ex-
tremely slow, and I was surprised to observe a fact that appears
to me wholly singular : the metal was taken up without any
extrication of nitrous gas; and this seemed to be the cause of
the-slow solution of this metal, as there was not that circula-
tion of the fluid, which takes-place in the solution of other
metals until the acid is nearly saturated.

As the want of production of gas appeared to retard the solu-
tion of palladium, I tried the eftect of impregnating a quantity
of the same acid previously with nitrous gas, and observed its
action to be very considerably augmented, although the expe-
riment was necessarily tried in the cold, because: the gas would
have been expelled by the application of heat.
