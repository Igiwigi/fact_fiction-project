This power model has already been identified for standard concrete using quasi-static direct
tension experiments, spalling tests conducted with a Hopkinson bar device [12] and with ultra-
high strain-rate uniaxial deformation tests carried out with a pulsed-power generator (générateur
électrique de pression intense, GEPI) [13].

A problem of mesh size dependency is often observed for damage models. In order to limit
this effect, the Hillerborg regularization model has been included [14]. In this method, the energy
consumed by a crack to propagate through a band of finite elements is no longer dependent on the
mesh size because of a fixed characteristic length L¢. In fact, the method consists in modifying the
softening part of the stress-strain relation in order to obtain the same fracture energy whatever
the mesh size. To do so, a new variable w is introduced,

@=1 if eq Ep, (2.13)
L

w= Py (1 - =) =“a(Ri) if eq > ep, (2.14)
& E L
4 eq) Le

where &p = H€pet(1 - )Epd with Ept and Epd being, respectively, the peak strain in tension
and compression. a(R;) is a corrective function dependent on the dynamic increase factor Rj.
