The
fertile frond is not unlike the fertile lobe of Botrychium. The sterile fronds are very
similar to the sterile part of the frond of Botrychium lunaria,+ but these features of
resemblance appear in other families of ferns as well. There is also the possibility

the group and in consideration of some additional facts to be demonstrated below, it
would seem that the evidence is perhaps in favour of a Fern rather than a Pteridosperm
connection.
