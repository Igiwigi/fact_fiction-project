These are the functions that participate in the standard thermal and linear momentum balance
equation (3.1).

The constitutive relations for the microstructural fields (4.5) then take the form

aw ay $
M=—5. 0a", spre tpvar, (5.3)
and - 7
a 1 a pM
m™ =_F (a + oat") +1, SMa pFs (<a + 9a ) +sM, (5.4)

where aM and sM are given by (4.6). In (5.3) and (5.4), the fields T1§ and 1™ characterize the
net driving force associated with internal rearrangements of the microstructure. In fact —dw/d&
and —d~/dH™ yield the free energy release in the bulk that is associated with changes in &
and M, respectively. Conversely, #AS and oA yield the internal resistance (i.e. the driving
force consumption) encountered during transformation and reorientation. The microstresses s°
and SM, which characterize actions on surface elements, contain terms describing a similar
partitioning into energy release and energy consumption.


The results (5.1)-(5.4) are expressed in terms of objective constitutive functions. This allows
one to rewrite the base expression appearing in (3.5) as
