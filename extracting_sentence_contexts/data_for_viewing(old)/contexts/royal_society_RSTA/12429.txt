nitrous acid to the latter, produces the property of conductivity “in a very high
degree among electrolytes.” Thus the presence of nitrous acid is the necessary

condition that nitric acid should become an electrolyte. Again, Farapay* proved
that the electric position of certain pairs of metals in nitric acid is varied according
to the conditions of concentration and temperature; in fact, experiments on this
point were considered by him to be of especial importance in confirming the chemical
and disproving the contact theory of the voltaic cell.

PoagEnporrF gives one determination of the E.M.F. of a cell consisting of copper,
nitric acid (sp. gr. = 1'222, with nine times its volame of water), and platinum; the
value found, taking the E.M.F. of a Daniell’s cell at 1070 millivolts, is calculated out
as 660 millivolts.

Tuomsent alludes to the various reactions occurring in the combinations zine /
H,SO,, 100 H,O/fuming nitric acid /carbon,as also zine/ H,SO,, 100 H,O/HNO,, 7H,0 /
carbon ; the chemical changes taking place in these cells are shown to vary with the
concentration of the acid and the chemical energy produced. In the latter cell there
