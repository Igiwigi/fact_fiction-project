1), the discharge in the tube becomes gensitive ; and this sensitiveness
may in general be increased by increasing the length of the air-spark, until the
discharge becomes visibly intermittent, 80 as no longer to appear to the eye as a
steady continuous discharge. Although this is by no means the only way in which
the sensitive discharge can be produced, it, is the one which is the mosb generally
convenient, for the purposes of experiment ; and it may on that account be regarded
as the typical mode of production. That the discharge within the tube should be
intermittent when the supply of electricity is rendered intermittent by the air-spark
is 80 obvious as not to need discussion, and though we cannot positively asserb (without
experimental evidence of the fact) that the pulses of free electricity of which the dis-
charge is composed pass into the tube instantaneously, it is difficult to imagine any
cireumstances under which we should less expect the individual discharges to have a
prolonged or continuous character than when, as in the present case, they are due to
charges of free electricity that come suddenly to the terminal of the tube after leaping
in the form of a disruptive discharge across the air-spark interval. Another method of producing a discharge which shows indications of sensitiveness
is by using an induction coil in connexion with a large condenser, such as that
described in a paper © On Stratified Discharges, V.” (Proceedings of the Royal
Society, xxvii., p. 60). If the discharge be allowed to pass through the tube while the
