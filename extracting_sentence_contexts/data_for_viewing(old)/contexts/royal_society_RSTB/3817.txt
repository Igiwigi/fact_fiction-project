indicate how the resin tissue in the other modern Conifers has been derived from their
Cordaitalean ancestors.

6. The medullary rays consist of thin-walled unpitted parenchyma, without typical
ray tracheids, though bent-ended tracheids are associated with the rays. These are
probably the precursors of the ray tracheids, since they have been found in the
Cordaitean forms and in the cone axis of the pines. The ray cells are practically
identical with those of the Cordaitez.

7. The rays of the bast have no albuminous cells, which are the counterparts of the
ray tracheids in such forms as have this specialisation of the rays.

The periderm is late in development in the stem, a fact possibly associated with the
persistent leaf base.

8. The state of development of the growth rings varies in the different species and
even in different individuals of the same species. Whether these are annual rings
has not been determined. They are often “inverse” or even root-like. Normal
rings also occur, so that the Araucarinese combine the characteristics of the growth
ring of the ancient and of the modern forms. Tangential pitting occurs where the
growth ring is well developed. It is usually multi-seriate and sometimes flattened.
