region, where the TADF materials formed by relatively strong electron donor-electron acceptor
units are more difficult to work, owing to the large Stokes-shift induced by the excited state charge
transfer [21]. In fact, most TADF materials emit in the green region, and obtaining efficient TADF
in the blue region is a very difficult task, which has not been fully achieved so far [20].

Figure 5 shows the chemical structure of the four materials used in this work, together with
their state diagrams and singlet and triplet energies. Material (2), one of the blue emitters used in
this work, is a pure non-charge transfer material, where only the 3arx* and the !z7* transitions
are involved on the population of the S; excited state. The singlet-triplet energy gap in (2) is large,
around 1.0 eV, and therefore TADF is not efficient. Material (2) is used purely as a reference for
the TTA mechanism.

The delayed luminescence observed in (2) is most probably entirely due to TTA (figure 6),
and thus varies with the square of the excitation dose in agreement with equation (3.7), showing
that in dilute solutions the monomolecular decay of the triplet state dominates over the triplet
