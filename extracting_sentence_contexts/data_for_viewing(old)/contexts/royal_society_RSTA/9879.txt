bands of calcium, yttrium, and other substances, but it was quite adequate for the
re-determination of wave-lengths, assuming the lines to have been correctly attributed
to scandium by THALEN. Measurements of photographs of the arc spectrum of the
mineral removed all doubt as to the precise correspondence of the spot lines 6210-90
and 6305'88 with strong lines of scandium first tabulated by THALEN,

The scandium lines came out so clearly in the spectra of some of the fragments of
euxenite that I was induced to carry the inquiry a stage further, in view of the
peculiar selection of lines for representation in the solar spectrum and in sunspots:
As I have previously remarked :{ “ The scandium lines which appear in the spots are
among the strongest in the are spectrum, while the possible coincidences with the
fainter lines are so few as to be probably accidental. At the same time there are
some strong are lines which are not intensified in the spots ; it is a noticeable fact
that these are more intense in the solar spectrum than those which appear in the
spots, and the probability is that all of them, like 5527-03, are related to the enhanced-
line class.” There is a similar selection of lines in the chromospheric spectrum, as also
remarked by LockyER and BAxanDALt, but the lines are different from those which
appear in spots.

Similar differences of behaviour have been noted in the case of other elements, but
scandium appeared to be rather an extreme example, and further study of the varying
intensities of its lines promised to be of value, not only in identifying particular lines
with scandium, but in helping to establish the principles to be followed in assigning
solar lines of different classes to metallic origins.
