In a broad sense this arises both from the
social uncertainty about whether and when mitigation efforts will be agreed and
achieved, as well as from the scientific uncertainty about how the many feedbacks
in the Earth system operate, arising from imperfect climate modelling, the role of
tipping points [9] and other limits to our understanding of the system. Hallegatte
[8] notes that these sources of uncertainty will not go away in the foreseeable
future: social uncertainties will play out over decades, and recent experiences of
improving scientific understanding have often led to more uncertainty about the
future rather than less [10], as the implications of unappreciated processes such
as ice-sheet dynamics become clearer. Set against these challenges, though, are two inescapable facts. Many areas
of human endeavour proceed in the face of great uncertainty. Hallegatte [8]
cites managing exchange rate risk, energy cost uncertainty and research and
development outcomes among others.
