largest, and which I suppose' to be impregnated, are of a
brownish yellow colour; they resist'a considerable degree
of force before they burst, and the contents when pressed
out melt as it were into a oft jelly, leaving a tough' mem-
brane which enveloped them. The smaller ova are of various
sizes and of nearly a white colour, and of 'a much more
Slender and compressed form than those which I have sup-
posed to be impregnated. This difference in the degree of
maturation corresponds with a fact stated by R6sxr, that the
mole-cricket does not deposit all the'eggs of the season at
one time. In a'few instances I found two or three ova which
had entered the narrowest part of 'the duct and were very
near the uterus ; and from the appearance .of these, which
may fairly be supposed to be, if not impregnated, at least
in a state fit for impregnation, I have ventured to derive the
character of the impregnated ovum.
