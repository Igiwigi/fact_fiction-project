inner pillar is a little prolonged backwards into a small additional cusp ; this prolonga-
tion is especially marked on the inner side of the last inferior molar, making the pos-
terior additional talon of this tooth quite double. This difference may be clearly 8cen
in comparing a lower jaw of a Camotherium from Auvyergne with the enlarged figures of
Pieter (+ Faune siderolitique,” plate xxvi. fig. 9, c). By all these characters the Caing-
therium Renevieri, Pict., differs from the true Cainotheria, and agrees entirely with
the Eocene Hyopotamide figured by RimnerER and by Prcter himself. Therefore the
Cainotherium Renevieri cannot remain in the genus in which it was put by Prever,
but must be arranged with the res: of the Eocene yopotamide, as Hyopotamus
Renevieri®.

I cannot refrain from stating that, in my opinion, the five-lobed character of the upper
molars is of a too general value to be used for generic distinction. In fact all the
Eocene and Miocene Paridigitate genera (with crescentic teeth) have five-lobed upper
molars, and therefore this character is as unfit for generic distinction, in this large
asxemblage of animals, as the fact of having four-lobed molars would be found unfit if
we tried to apply it to the living Ruminantia; it is of too general a nature, all living
Ruminantia having four-lobed upper molars.

In such cases where the true molars present too great a uniformity for furnishing
good distinctive characters, the shape of the premolars may be of great use, as was well
shown by Professors RimiMerER and HrNsRL, in reference to Suina and Ruminantia.
And, in fact, if we compare the premolars of the Eocene Hyopotamideae figured by Prover
and HuMBerr, {Zlyopotamus Gresslyi, H. Renevieri, and even his Z. erispus (1. c. plate
xxiv. fig. 11), we shall see that all these Eocene Zſyopotamideae, though of such different
