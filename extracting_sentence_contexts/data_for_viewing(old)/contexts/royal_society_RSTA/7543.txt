It may happen that a form can be shown to reduce in such a way that in each term of the
reduced expression one factor is an invariant; that is to say, that the variables x and uw which
occur in the form are never separated in the process of reduction. When this is the case, the
same reduction will clearly demonstrate the reduction of the form in which x, w are replaced
by any cogredient symbols (or combinations of symbols) such that the form has an actual
(as opposed to a symbolical) meaning. We shall make frequent use of this principle in what
follows. A reduction of this type will be called an invariant reduction, and when it is necessary
to emphasize the invariant nature of the reduction the equivalence sign will be replaced
by the symbol =.

It may also happen that a particular form whose symbolic expression involves a symbol
p (or a symbol f used as a suffix) can be shown to be reducible without making use of the
fact that a symbolic product containing a factor p, is reducible, and without splitting p up
into a pair of equivalent symbols (â€™). If this is the case we can clearly replace p by any
cogredient combination of symbols. This process will also be used, on occasion, in the course
of the work.

402 J. A. TODD ON TERNARY QUADRATIC TYPES

4, If P is the symbolic expression of a form, all the forms whose symbolic expressions are
obtained from P by permuting the symbols referring to the different quadratics will be said
to form a set, it being understood that the permutation applies to all the symbols referring to
