But as Grirrirus remarks, “There can be but little doubt that the mass of
mereury expelled from a Bunsen Calorimeter by the subtraction of a definite thermal
unit, is a quantity that can be and doubtless will be determined with accuracy.”
(Grirrirus, ‘ Phil. Trans., A, vol. 186, 1895, p. 265.) It was with the object of
contributing something to the solution of this problem that the investigation to be
detailed subsequently was undertaken,

Previous Methods and Results.

The first paper of importance, as regards scientific accuracy, on these subjects was
published by Brunner in 1845 (‘ Pogg. Ann.,’ vol. 140, p. 118, 1845), but before
treating of his paper, we may glance at the state of knowledge on the subject when
he attacked it. He was led to take up the research by the fact that Prerznonpr
(Perznoxpr, ‘ Beitriige zur Geognosie von Tyrol, 1843) had announced that ice
expanded when its temperature was lowered. PrrzHonpr obtained this result
experimentally, and proceeded to found thereon a new theory of glacier action which
had the effect of bringing his paper into prominent notice. The idea that ice contracted
on warming was an old one, and had been originally mooted by MusscHENBROEK,
