Temporally, we have focused here on relatively recent his-
torical populations from well-understood contexts (medieval
and post-medieval northwestern Europe) for pragmatic
(reliable contextual information, good preservation, access
to digitization technology, osteological expertise) and theor-
etical reasons (controversies about sexing using the lower
jaw, changes in food and nutrition, sound changes in the his-
tory of Dutch). But our experience clearly suggests that this
can be extended back in time for as far as there are well-pre-
served components of the vocal tract in the fossil record,
emphatically preceding the emergence of anatomically
modern humans a few hundred thousand years ago [140]. Geographically, there is nothing special about northwes-
tern Europe besides the fact that it is historically rather well
understood and archeologically intensively studied, but as
more work is conducted in other regions, as more osteologi-
cal and fossil data become available, either physically (in
museums and collections) or digitally (as three-dimensional
optical or CT scans), and as the various non-scientific
hurdles related to accessing these data diminish, this type
of investigation can be used to shed light on regional or
larger-scale developments. Finally, we are guilty of producing yet another study of
vowel production here (although we do provide the formants
Fl to F5 and the spectra up to 5000 Hz), but this can be
extended to other speech sounds and vocal tract structures
as well. Just to cite a few possibilities, one could investigate
the alveolar ridge and its effects on click consonants
[91,141], hard palate shape and ‘1’ [41], dentition/bite and
labiodentals [94], or larynx position and, indeed, vowels [4].
