For instance, in the case of Rb, if L.’s values for P (1) and S (3) be used, N,—N = —12,
N,—N = 1300. IfS.’s values for P (1) and S (3.4) are used, N,—N = 141, N,—N = 651. In the first case P is reproduced as well as the original, but S not so well; in fact,
S() comes out too large. In the second, P is not so good, and § is better than
with the 1300 difference. The discussion shows, however, that within easy limits of
error the N of P may be taken as constant, and for a provisional value the usual
value of N will do very well.
