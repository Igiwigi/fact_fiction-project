Now, in dealing with WzrBrr's theory ib would seem more suitable to take RK,
the magnetic force in a spherical cavity, as the independent variable. If we assume
Wesper's theory with this modification we arrive at the following conelusions —

1. All observations yet made upon the magnetisation of iron are upon the straight
part of WzBER's curve.

2, The particular features of curves of magnetisation as ordinarily observed arise
from a 8light irregularity in WeBer's curve, magnified by the near approach of iron
to a state in which a random distribution of the magnetic axes of the molecules is
unstable.

I do not put these remarks forward as indicating more than the fact that we are
very long way from obtaining a range of facts sufficiently extended for testing ©
molecular theory of magnetism: The broad fact which strikes the mind mos forcibly
is the specific difference which exists between magnetic and non-magnetie bodies.
Most bodies are either very slightly ferro-magnetic or very slightly diamagnetic. On
the other hand iron, nickel, and cobalt are enormously magnetic.

Iron with 12 per cent. of manganese, and some small quantities of carbon and
other substances, is 80 little magnetic that its magnetism would be accounted for by |
supposing that in its mass were distributed a few little bits of pure iron. There
