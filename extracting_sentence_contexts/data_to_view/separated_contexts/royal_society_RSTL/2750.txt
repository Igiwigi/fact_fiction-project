for r, we shall obtain the following equation of the system of branches of the curve
of contact :

(cos a, sin i=aft — (cos &, sin =

From this equation we learn the important fact, that no more than two points of
the curve of contact can exist for each value of 0. To render it subservient to the
completion of our object in this inquiry, it will be necessary to establish two other
properties, viz. that the quantity under the radical is essentially positive, 80 as to
render the curve real for all values of 0, and that of these values one is greater and
the other less than þ sec 0.
