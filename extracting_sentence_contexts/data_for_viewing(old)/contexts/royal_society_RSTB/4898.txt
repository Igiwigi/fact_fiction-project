(2) Within any genus, in any interval of time, an “ accident ’’ may happen that brings
about the throwing of a (viable) “ generic mutation,” 7.e., a new form so different from
the parent that it will be placed in a new genus.

The chance of this occurrence in any assigned interval of time is similarly taken as
the same for all genera within the group considered and as constant for all time.

These statements call for some comment.

(a) The assumptions that the chances of specific (or generic) mutation are identical
for all forms within the group considered and constant for all time are unlikely to be
in accordance with the facts, but have to be made to simplify the work.

(b) The chance. of a generic mutation or a specific mutation occurring is not taken as
dependent on the number of individuals in the genus or species. It cannot be said with
certainty whether it is so dependent or no till we know the nature of a mutation, though
there very probably is such dependence, and there must be dependence if the “ accident ”
that brings about a mutation is of the nature of a breakdown in the mechanism which
forms the germ-cells. But in any case, and apart from the great additional complexity
it would introduce, [ was compelled to ignore the number of individuals as I could feel
no confidence in any assumption as to the function which number of individuals, that
is the “ size of the species,” would be of the age of the species. At first, as the species
spreads, the number of individuals must tend to increase. But over the very long
periods which have to be considered there must be a countervailing tendency to ultimate
