Again 1—m will always be positive, or m less than unity. For the upper branch
of the loop of the biquadratic lies below its asymptote, or 88,—96,—123 = 0, and
accordingly below the line 88,—98,-12 = 0; thus the numerator of 1—m is always
positive. So also is the denominator, for the upper branch always lies above the line
28,—36,—6 = 0.*

* In fact the R-line (58 -68,—9 = 0) the parallel to the asymptote (8) - 9) - 12 = 0), the limiting
frequency line (f,—,-—1 = 0), and the Type III. line (28;-38-—6 = 0) meet in the point By = -
f, = —4 of the negative quadrant and the upper branch of the loop lies in the angle between the first two
and in the positive quadrant,

As m is positive and less than unity the area and moments of the curve are all real
and finite. When the point (8, 8,) moves along the loop of the biquadratic towards
the R-point (8, = 1'8, 8, = 0), the value of 1—m becomes more and more nearly
unity, and ultimately at R we have m = 0, or the frequency curve is

a rectangle, 7.e., we reach the rectangle point. If on the other hand we move towards
infinity along the upper branch of the biquadratic loop, we find 1—m approaches the
value 1/8, and thus ultimately becomes zero, or m= 1.
