In contrast, anxiety was not altered by overex-
pressing FKBP51 in the dorsal hippocampus of mice [69] or
by knocking down FKBP% in the prelimbic cortex of rats [76]. The region-specific influence of FKBP51 in the amygdala is criti-
cal for anxiety regulation. In fact, stress-related mechanisms
have also been shown to modulate FKBP51 in the amygdala. One study found that chronic stress increases amygdalar
FKBP51 in mice through a mechanism involving neuropsin-
mediated cleavage of the tyrosine receptor kinase, EphB2 [75]. A more recent study found that microRNA-15a_ inhibits
