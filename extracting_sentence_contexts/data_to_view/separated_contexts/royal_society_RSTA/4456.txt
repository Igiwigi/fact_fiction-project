x The Compensation. a It is an interesting fact that pure aluminium expands 2°6 times as much as
Splatinum-iridium for the same increment of temperature, and it is this fact which the
guthor has utilised for the purpose of effecting compensation for the expansion of the
platinum-iridium serews. A circular disc of aluminium, whose thickness is about ten
Siwenty-sixths of the length of the parts of the platinum-iridium screws projecting
Ghrough and above the table, is laid upon the latter. Provided adequate care has
‘been taken to adjust the screws to the length calculated for complete compensation,
obrom a knowledge of the two coefticients of expansion, it will be evident that the
‘Sxpansion of the apparatus is entirely eliminated.
