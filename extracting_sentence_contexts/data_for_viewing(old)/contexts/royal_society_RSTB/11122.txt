set with numerosity 4 are the same as the speed and accuracy
with which a numerosity of 60 can be discriminated form a
numerosity of 40. The dependence of discriminability solely
on the objectively measured ratio has two consequences
called the size effect and the distance effect. The size effect
refers to the fact that the discriminability of given numerical
difference depends on the size of the two discriminanda.
Thus, for example, a difference of 2 is easily recognized
when the discriminanda are 4 and 2, but the same difference
is unrecognizable by the non-verbal system for representing
numerosity when the discriminanda are 52 and 50. The distance

effect refers to the fact that the discriminability of two numeros-
ities depends on how widely separated they are. We—and all
other vertebrate species tested—more readily discriminate 10
from five than we discriminate six from five. Both the size
effect and the distance effect are implied by Weber's Law.
This property of the non-verbal representation leads to its
being called the Approximate Number System. Remarkably,
this Weber’s Law property also governs the reaction times of
human subjects when deciding on the ordering of two
numerals (the written symbols for number) [11,12].

Male frogs, and other anurans, use enumeration for a quite
different purpose, as Rose describes [13]. The number and type
