are present in the usual sulpho-acids. Sulphanilic acid, C,, H, NS, O,, may be viewed
as formed by the association of one equivalent of aniline and two equivalents of an-
hydrous sulphuric acid.

We were curious to ascertain whether this acid, by assimilating once more the
elements of anhydrous sulphuric acid, was capable of becoming disulphanilic acid,
CoH;zNS,O:j.-

The existence of disulphobenzolic acid, C,, H;S, O,,, the barium-salt of which we
have descrihed in the preceding pages, together with the formation of an interesting
acid lately obtained by M. KiLkexkawy* in the reaction of sulphite of ammonium
on dinitrobenzol, appeared to leave no doubt regarding the existence of a disulph-
anilic acid. In fact, M. Kiixenkany's dithiobenzic acid, C,,H,N,S,0,., is most inti-
mately connected with the acid we were in search of, as is obvious by a glance at the
following Table, in which we have placed a number of known substances in juxta-
position with bodies, ideal at present, but the existence of which can no longer be
doubted.
