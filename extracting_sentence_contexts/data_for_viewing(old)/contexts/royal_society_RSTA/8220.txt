important when it is remembered that four-fifths of the vapour is absorbed in the first

* It is obvious that when the posterior H,SO, becomes diluted by the vapour carried forward by the air
ipso facto, the forward diffusion tends to cease, but it may be argued that back diffusion, if any, into the
anterior acid still goes on. Even if this be so, the air leaving the third branch of this vessel is dry and will

thus dry the fourth branch, thus receiving precisely the amount lost; but this may not apply to EtOH
on account of chemical reaction.

branch of the sulphuric acid vessel. This latter fact, the effect of which cannot be
calculated, prevents any other than rough qualitative results emerging from the analysis
of such experiments as can throw light on the hypothesis. In this connection it should
be borne in mind that in most cases we are dependent on the “ handling corrections ”
which are far from accurate.

We must therefore be content to consider our hypothesis as probably true if the second
vessel losses are found to run in the direction indicated, 7.e., that the loss is less the
swifter the air current.

In Table VIT all the second vessel losses are gathered together and numbered (first
column) for convenience in reference. The losses are corrected for “ handling ” where
a proper H and C correction was not known.
