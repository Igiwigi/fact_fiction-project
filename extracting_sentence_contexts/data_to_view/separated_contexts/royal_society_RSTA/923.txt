By taking a point on the axis r=0 in the interval 0 <= </h,
when I= 2r, we see that the coefficients A, are determined from the expansion

Proceeding us in Section 2, making use of (18) and (15), we find that the goneral formulw

for A, are the same as (14). An inspection of (17) shows, furthermore, that the special

formula (18) with (dZ,/dz),-, = 0 is applicable, while the first term in the expansion
(19) is omitted, in view of the fact that C = 0.

depth.
