This resistance to combination can be considerably increased by a
Sriety of circumstances. The presence of a very small quantity of foreign gas in the
rmal mixture of chlorine and hydrogen is sufficient to cause this resistance to be
Mcreased to a very great extent. EZ Experiments made for the purpose of determining the influence of such impurities on
He sensIbility of the gas are subject to a great difficulty, owing to the fact, that in
Srder to avoid all the disturbing phenomena of absorption and diffusion, it is not, possible
Aerely to add the foreign gas to the normal mixture in. the insolation-vessel, but it is
necessary to allow the impurity as well as the chlorine and hydrogen to pass for hours
through the liquids of the apparatus until the absorptiometric equilibrium is completely
established. It is perfectly useless to collect the electrolytic gas in a large vessel, then
to mix it with the impurity, and afterwards to allow the mixture to pass through the
apparatus, for there is no possible means of collecting this pure mixture of chlorine and
hydrogen in large quantities and again forcing it out in a given direction.
