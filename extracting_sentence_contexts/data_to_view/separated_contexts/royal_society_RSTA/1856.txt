The late Justice Antonin Scalia submitted a minority,
dissenting opinion. Scalia argued that the Balanced Treatment Act correctly defined evolution
and creationism as two competing theories for the origin of life. He further defended the Act’s
requirement ‘... that, whenever the subject of origins is covered, evolution be taught as a theory,
rather than as proven scientific fact’ (p. 14). Scalia’s argument promotes two key misunderstandings of Darwin’s theory. First, Darwin
states explicitly that his theory is not about the origin of life.
