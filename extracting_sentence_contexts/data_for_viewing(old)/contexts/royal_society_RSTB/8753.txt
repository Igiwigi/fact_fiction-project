the underlying processes, or misidentifying processes, can be a
major obstacle to incorporating environmental regime shifts
and states into stock-recruitment relationships. In addition,
the confounding effects of fishing on spawning biomass can
mask environmental signals in recruitment unless: (i) less than
50% of the total recruitment variability is due to random varia-
bility [41] and (ii) recruitment observations span at least a whole
regime shift and state [32].

Ecosystem regime shifts and states also impact other biologi-
cal parameters, such as growth. Unlike recruitment time series,
there are probably several size-at-age time series that are long
enough to span at least one regime shift and state. In fact, several
stock assessments now include time-varying growth [42-44].
Expanding time-varying growth to include environmental for-
cing could include regime-shift impacts since size-at-age can
dramatically change from one regime state to another [45]. How-
ever, environmental forcing of growth or other biological
parameters will result from indirect impacts (e.g. prey avail-
ability) and direct impacts (i.e. physiological impacts such as
mortality) which can have confounding consequences. There-
fore, it is unlikely that these avenues of investigation will
provide better results than those produced with environmentâ€”
recruitment studies, unless a large portion of the variability is
due to direct impacts. Since biological parameters, such as
