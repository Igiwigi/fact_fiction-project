The enhancement of (4922 and 4388 relatively to 6678 is at once obvious, by
inspection of the table, in the case of the low pressure spectrum. It is in fact even
more remarkable than in the corresponding Helium series. Moreover, 4388 is
enhanced relatively to 14922. The remarks which we made earlier regarding \4472
in the nebular spectrum apply with greater force to \4388, The behaviour of these
two lines in nebulz is thus correlated, in the light of these experiments, by the fact
that nebule are in a state of extremely low pressure—and certainly much lower than
in the present investigation, so that the relative enhancement of \4471 and \4388
may be expected to be much greater. But the degree to which the phenomenon
occurs, even with the present exhaustion of the tube, is sufficiently convincing.

As in the case of the Diffuse series of Helium, this effect again cannot be described
as a continuous transfer of energy down the series, for if this were the case, \4144
would become visible when enhanced to a greater degree than \4388. It is actually
