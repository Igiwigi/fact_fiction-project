Now this effect you will, I think, find to be perfectly con-
sistent with the view you have taken of the subject, in your
letter of Jan. 13th, where you say in reference to your for-
mer query, and to the views I then entertained, * I should
rather have expected a diminution of the magnetic polarity,
commensurate to the rapidity of rotation and a change in the
direction of the magnetic axis of the globe, from parallelism
to that of the earth, to a position somewhere intermediate
between that and the axis of rotation, but approaching nearer
the latter as the velocity increased, &c.‚Äù

The fact is, that the needle in my experiments being under
no influence prior to the rotation from either the iron or the
earth, the direction which it takes up in consequence of the
motion, enables us to discover the precise direction of the
new forces thus iimpressed upon the shell, and it will be
seen immediately to indicate a polarization of the latter in the
direction c d; that is, in a direction perpendicular to the axis
of motion, and to the plane passing through that axis and the
actual poles of the ball.

You will of course understand that I do not mean that
such a polarization actually takes place; I mean merely that
the cohesive power of the iron is such, as to resist in a cer-
