equation there is clearly no worry, but the boundary condition presents great technical
difficulties.

The difficulty can be seen with reference to figure 7, in which it is required to establish
finite-difference equations at points adjacent to the curved boundary, and to satisfy a boun-
dary condition involving a normal derivative. The differential equation at the point 0
involves the fictitious points 1 and 2, and expressions for the values at these points must
therefore be obtained in terms of internal points and the given boundary conditions. There
are two obvious possibilities, neither of which is completely satisfactory.

FicureE 7

First, normals can be drawn from the fictitious points (Fox 1944) and the boundary con-
dition satisfied at the points where these normals cut the boundary. In figure 7, for example,
the normal from 1 cuts the boundary at B, and internal mesh lines at points marked with
a cross. Formulae can therefore be established for the value at 1 in terms of the normal
derivative at B (and the functional value at B if required), and values at the crossed points.
The latter can then be obtained, by interpolation along mesh lines, in terms of interior
values.

Alternatively, the boundary conditions can be satisfied at points like C, where the mesh
lines hit the boundary, by expressing the normal derivative at C in terms of the derivatives
in the x and y directions. The x-derivative can be obtained from the values at Cand the points
marked with closed circles, the latter being obtained by interpolation from internal values.
The y-derivative, and the functional value at C, are obtained from the mesh points 20...
