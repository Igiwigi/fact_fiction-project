I propose to solve the following problem :—

A globe, of radius 7, is surrounded by a number of concentric spherical shells,
called A,, As, Ay. .., of thicknesses a, ag, @3..., respectively. The globe remaining
at its initial temperature, the shell A, is cooled by ¢,°, the shell A, by ¢,° in the same
time, and so on. The linear coefficient of expansion being ¢, and the same for all the
Shells, it is required to find the distribution of strain resulting from this method of
Soling,

3 (6). Consider the shell A,. If the globe were absent, the radius of its inner
Surface would become 7(1 —et,). It is, however, obliged to remain of radius 7, and
& must, therefore, be stretched. Assuming the stretching to be uniform throughout
fhe shell, and expressing the fact that the volume of the shell after cooling ¢,° is
Equal to its original volume multiplied by 1 — 3et,, it will be found that the radius of
Bhe outer surface of the shell is
