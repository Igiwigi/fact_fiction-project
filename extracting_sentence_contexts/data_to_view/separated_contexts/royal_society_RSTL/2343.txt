Hat the uſe of the lungs is to carry off a putrid effuvium,
& to diſcharge that phlogiſton, which had been taken

E Feral, I have now, Ithink, proved to be effected by means
F the 20d, in conſequence of its coming ſo nearly into

a fluid wonderfully formed to imbibe, and part with,
Hat principle which the chemiſts call phlogiſton, and
Shanging its colour in conſequence of being charged with

ances, which prevent its coming into immediate con-
fact with the air. PAs it may not be unpleaſing or unuſeful, I ſhall,
