If we open a chemical treatise and examine the equations expressive of actual results,
we cannot fail to be impressed by the cireumstance that numerous equations satisfy
this condition and are of the * normal ” form. For example,

SIR B, C. BRODIE ON THE CALCULUS OF CHEMICAL OPERATIONS. 69

(1) Two units of hydrochloric acid are identical with a unit of hydrogen and a
unit of chlorine.

(2) A unit of oxychloride of phosphorus and three units of water are identical
with three units of hydrochloric acid and a unit of phosphoric acid.

(3) A unit of alcohol and a unit of oxygen are identical with a unit of water aud
a unit of acetic acid.

(4) Two units of ammonia and a unit of oxalic ether are identical with two units
of alcohol and a unit of oxamide.

(5) A unit of glycerine and three units of acetic acid are identical with three units
of water and one unit of triacetine.

(6) A unit of lactic acid and two units of hydriodic acid are identical with a unit
of propionic acid, a unit of water, and a unit of iodine.

(7) A unit of mannite and eleven units of hydriodic acid are identical with a unit
of iodide of hexyl, six units of water, and five units of iodine.

(8) Five units of hydrogen and a unit of pentoxide of iodine are identical with
five units of water and a unit of iodine. Snch examples might be greatly multiplied, Equations possessing this peculiar
property are not due to accident, but to the simplicity of natural laws.
