This tendency to vertical folding in the aboriginal Australian, as determined by
the form of the intrastriate sulci, constitutes a very interesting feature because it is

much more marked than in the brain of the Chinese. In the Australian the medial
occipital region is much less developed than in the Chinese brain. There is a much
smaller cuneus and the arcus intercuneatus is much more frequently exposed. In
the examination of some hundreds of Chinese hemispheres, although there are cases
of vertical folding, I have not met with any specimens showing collections of primitive
features such as the Australian brain does. These facts make one hopeful that a
definite basis for racial classification may be obtained from the whole features of the
brain, but it is certain that such a basis cannot be obtained with reference to indivi-
dual features.

S.5.R. (Plate 19)—FLasHMman’s description of this hemisphere is very accurate and
complete so far as the actual disposition of the sulci is concerned. His account of
the occipital region is reproduced in full so that the difference in interpretation may
be fully discussed.

“ Right Occipital Region—As has been said, the condition of the two occipital
lobes differs considerably. If we look at the photograph of the mesial surface
of the right occipital lobe we will see that the posterior end of the retrocalcarine
