measure the cortical microvasculature in vivo, these physiological
assumptions have been shown to be inaccurate. First, it was
shown that most of the vascular-volume increase originates
from the arterial compartment rather than from the venous
pool as previously thought [18,32]. Second, it has been known
that oxygen is extracted before the capillary bed [33,34] and
therefore, the oxygen saturation in the precapillary arterioles
and the capillaries themselves is much lower than previously
assumed. Recent microscopy techniques have shown that 50%
of the total oxygen delivered to the brain tissue is coming from
the arterials [27]. Taken together, these new findings indicate
that the parameter a in the Davis model must represent an effec-
tive compliance parameter that takes into account the fact that
(i) precapillary arterioles experience a large volume increase
that contributes weakly to the BOLD response owing to a
