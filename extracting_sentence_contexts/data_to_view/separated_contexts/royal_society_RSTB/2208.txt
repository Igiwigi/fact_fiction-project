As regards functional value this
character of the Mammalian limb is on a par with details of structure which are

not specific, and, therefore, with other details of structure outside those immediately
© acquired by the species, not to be considered as of necessity of present functional
importance. The functional use of the contribution of one or two nerve-fibres to a
muscle requiring hundreds is difficult to see; the probability of the occurrence
of such poverty-stricken contributions is, on the view of the morphological necessity
of the ray-arrangement of the limb musculature, so high as to be only what might
have been expected from theoretical considerations. The fact that certain’of the
motor-roots of the limb contribute fibres to the innervation of certain muscles
in such scanty number as to be ineffective for movement is a further argument
for the morphological rather than functional character of the motor-root distribution
in the Mammalian limb. A number of motor-fibres, too small to evoke appreciable
movement in a muscle when excited electrically, will hardly be effective for movement
under the action of the will. As to the relation between delicacy of co-ordination and number of nerve-roots
contributing to motor innervation, one remembers that no muscles are more delicately
adjustible than the ocular, although their individual innervation must be considered
uni-segmental.
