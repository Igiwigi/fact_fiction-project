It is also unfortunate that Hoap.ry isolated the ectoderm and endoderm together,
so that it is impossible to say where the competencies are localised ; while the added
possibilities for the occurrence of induction make the interpretation of a series of processes
of differentiation still more difficult.

Hoaptey’s work does not in any way deal with “the origin of parts possessing
irreversible prospective value’: he made no attempt to reverse (7.e., alter) the pros-
pective value, so that the definitive test was lacking. Similarly, Werzen (1929), and
Hunt (1929a, 6, 1931), and Wittier and Rawtss (1931) and Umanskr (1931) have
made speculations as to the position of the organisation centre in the chick embryo,
based on self-differentiation experiments. But the characteristic feature of an
organiser-region is not that it can self-differentiate but that it can alter the prospective
value of other tissue. Experiments designed with this fact in view have been described
in this paper, and it has been shown that alteration of the prospective value can
oceur.

In the first place there is an influence of the endoderm on the growth of the primitive
streak. This is probably effected by an influence exerted on the material movements
taking place in the epiblast, and it is suggested that, probably, the endoderm not only
affects the movements but also originates them.

In the second place, we have the induction of medullary plate by the primitive streak ,
probably by the mesoderm which is formed therefrom.

Lastly, the axial epiblastic structures can cause the formation of a foregut from
