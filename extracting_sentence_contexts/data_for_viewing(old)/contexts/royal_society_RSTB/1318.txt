tissues. The struggle for supremacy showed itself first in the conversion, not of the
chorda itself, but of its produce, its sheath. With the introduction of skleromerism
(itself an innate result of the conversion of the bulk of the skeletogenous layer into
cartilage) the partly converted chordal sheath had necessarily to partake of this

metamerism, and its existence was thenceforth guaranteed in the shape of chorda- :

centra.

Another form of the struggle exhibits the suppression of the chordal sheath. When
this first began we do not know. The few recent cartilaginous Ganoids and Cyclos-
tomes do not show any reduction of the sheath, but in the osseus Ganoids and
Teleosteans it was the consequence of the fact that the same skleral metamerism had
asserted itself. It is obvious that gradual suppression of a more primitive rival is a
more complete victory than its conversion.

Tt is wrong to assume that the so-called membranous stage of the vertebral
column is followed by a likewise non-segmented continuous cartilaginous stage.

Such a notion was based upon the observation, subsequently shown to be erroneous,
that in the five daysâ€™ chick embryo the chorda becomes surrounded by an unsegmented
tube of continuous cartilage before it shows any indication of metamerism. Had
the observation been true, the structure in question must undoubtedly have been
considered as a ccenogenetic feature. For we now know that in fishes even the
uniformly unsegmented layer of cartilage in the chordal sheath is a secondary
