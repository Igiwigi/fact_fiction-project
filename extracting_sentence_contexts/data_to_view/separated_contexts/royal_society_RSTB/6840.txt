When later
(1935) Broom published a section of the skull, the position of the critical sutures of
this bone are quite different (figure 8c). Here the parasphenoid is shown underlying
the basisphenoid, and not extending so far forward as in the earlier figure. In fact,
the section is an entirely hypothetical one, as is indicated by the dotting of the lines,
and does not supply the critical evidence of the forward migration of the parasphenoid. ON THE EVOLUTION OF THE MAMMALIAN PALATE 317

Broom’s drawing of the palate suggests a different interpretation. The animal is a
small one, and if, as might be expected from its advanced skeletal structures, the
brain has become larger than that of its more primitive ancestors, then the “pre-
sphenoid” would have had to move down to provide the necessary accommodation.
