This occurs corresponding
to a period of 1°865 years, or 97 weeks. The amplitude, in the measure indicated
above, is 413. This amplitude far exceeds—in fact, is double the value of—the
amplitude given by any other period except those in the nearest vicinity, namely,
those for 96 and 98 weeks, Had the 97-week period not varied during the
75 years in question, such high amplitudes would not have been observed, but the
magnitude of the variation is no greater than might be expected in a biological
phenomenon of this kind. The next point to be noted is the extent to which the
numbers of deaths from measles are affected by the solar year. Amplitudes of
approximately 200 are found both for the yearly and half-yearly periods.
