SrrasBuRGER (1872, p. 69) has also drawn
attention to somewhat similar analogies among Angiosperms, of which the adnate
inflorescence of Tilia affords the most familiar instance. The fact that the supply to the ovuliferous scale appears to arise from the supply
to the bract, therefore, does not necessarily indicate that the one organ is morpho-
logically an exerescence of the other.

(b) Degree of Development of the Ovuliferous Scale as an Index of Affinities.—
Considerable importance has been attached by several authors to the degree of
development of the ovuliferous scale as an index of affinity or of relative antiquity. While the exponents of the ligular theory have naturally interpreted the poorly
developed ovuliferous scale of Araucaria and Agathis as signifying primitiveness,
Prof, Jerrrey and his pupils, who believe in the brachyblast theory and in the
Abietineous origin of the Conifers, have made use of the fact that in Pinus and allied
genera the ovuliferous scale (in the middle region of the cone) appears more nearly to
resemble an axillary shoot than it does in Araucaria. Finally, against those who
advocate a Cordaitean ancestry for the Conifers, the criticism has been made (SewarD
and Forp, 1906, p. 393) that as we pass backwards in geological time we do not find
an increasing development of the ovuliferous scale, which would bring the older
Conifers (Araucarineze) more nearly into line with Cordaites. We have seen, however, that the degree of development of the ovuliferous scale is
variable, not only within narrow circles of affinity (Eames, 1913, on Athrotaxis spp.),
but even in different regions of the same cone (Aasg, 1915).
