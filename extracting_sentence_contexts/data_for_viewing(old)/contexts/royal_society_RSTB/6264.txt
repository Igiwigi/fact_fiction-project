all of which were adult, were caught by hand in barley stubble when the stooks were
being carted ; 16 adults and about 10 immature animals, of which all the adults
and 2 immature animals were preserved and are recorded, were caught in clover
stubble. About 15 animals were trapped of which 1 was adult and the others

immature. The adult and 8 of the immature animals were preserved and are
recorded above. Elsewhere during the months of September, October, and
November, 4 adults and 135 immature animals were trapped and 1 adult was picked
up dead. Thus a great preponderance of immature animals were trapped during
these months both in Hertfordshire and elsewhere. The fact that of approximately
35 animals caught in barley and clover stubbles 25 were adults clearly indicates that
for some obscure reason this method of obtaining material favoured the taking of
adults as compared with trapping.

The numbers of each sex obtained each month are given in Table II. The upper
part of the table contains animals taken in the year in which they were born, the
lower part animals in their second year.
