for the origin in the first instance of a sorus with a plurality of sporangia united
together, as in Asterotheca, though I think this not improbably the mode of their
origin. I am disposed to regard such synangial types as being probably the more
primitive, and to think that a progressive separation of the individual sporangia has
led from these to such a type as Angiopteris or Hawlea. This view is at least
consistent with the facts, so far as 1 understand them, though it is not put forward
as in any way demonstrated. A full discussion of this matter will, however, be
deferred for the present ; it will find its best place when the Leptosporangiate ferns
have been examined, and it is to them that the next part of these Studies will be
largely devoted, while it will also include a discussion of the morphology of the
spore-producing members of Pteridophytes at large.

Certain of the facts brought forward in this Memoir have a general bearing. It
follows from the occurrence of partial septa, and of gradual steps in septation, that in
the cases where this occurs the identity of the individual sporangium is not main-
tained. Seeing, in the Leptosporangiate ferns, the wonderful specialisation of the
sporangium, and the regularity of its segmentation, the mind is disposed to accord to
it a definite individuality ; but this is only a character of this highly-specialised
series, and is in itself one of the most clear marks of their specialisation. In such a
leaf as that illustrated in fig. 30, the identity of the single sporangium seems quite
lost, and it may be left as an interesting matter for reflection whether or not such a
condition is to be considered as more primitive than the highly-individualised
sporangia of a Polypodiwm.

Again, it is a matter of general interest to note any further example of the want of
