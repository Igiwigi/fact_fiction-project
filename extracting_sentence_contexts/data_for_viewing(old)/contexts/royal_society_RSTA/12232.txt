* MM. Matrarp and Le Cuaretier conclude from their experiments that some dissociation occurs
when equal yolumes of hydrogen and chlorine are exploded. When excess of hydrogen is added they
find no dissociation.

148 PROFESSOR H. B. DIXON ON THE RATE OF EXPLOSION IN GASES.

The fact that the rate of explosion of hydrogen and chlorine exceeds the calculated
velocity of the sound-wave, as calculated from THomsen’s Heat of Combination
(22,000 cals.), is possibly due to the behaviour of the unburnt chlorine in the wave-
front. The rates agree fairly with the sound-wave calculated from the mean heat of
combination, which I have given in the table.

There is, lastly, one important phenomenon in the propagation of explosions in gases
which I have not touched on—the pressure produced in the reacting gases. BUNSEN
was the first who attempted to measure this pressure. In his well-known work* he
describes the explosion of mixtures of hydrogen and of carbonic oxide with oxygen in
a strong vessel closed with a loaded lid. When the pressure produced in the vessel
