[14,38]: these show that the dispersion equation for a two-dimensional square array of meta-
atoms (cylindrical Helmholtz resonators) possesses the structure Keio) tke) - o Boa =0 at
low frequencies, which is identical to that for linear uniform anisotropic media. In light of
these observations, we do not find evidence to suggest that two-dimensional arrays of Helmholtz
resonators possess low-frequency Willis coupling effects in bulk, despite the presence of Willis-
like effects in the scattering response of a single meta-atom. How this effect is averaged out in
this limit certainly warrants further investigation; however, it seemingly does not manifest in
bulk at low frequencies and so we encourage the use of alternative nomenclature (e.g. Willis-like
depolarizability) for the behaviour observed in (A 3).

Asa final corollary, an apparent Willis coupling effect could inadvertently be introduced where
it does not genuinely exist, through a specific decomposition of Bot OF Peg to recover the form of
(A7). This is due to the fact that uniqueness is not present in any homogenization description, in
the absence of additional constraints. For the purposes of comparison, we present the scattered
field profile @s- and scattering efficiency Qsc for the resonator geometry considered in Melnikov
et al. [15] in figure 7. Here, we observe relatively strong enhancements in both the scattered field
and scattering efficiency at the Helmholtz resonance ky, as expected, and only comment that
there could be room for obtaining a stronger response through an optimization search of the type
considered in figure 3d.
