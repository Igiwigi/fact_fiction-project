GILBERT, AND M, T. MASTERS,

plot became more gramineous than that on the former, and it included a larger number
of other grasses in moderate proportion than did the produce with the ammonia-
salts alone. In fact, with the ammonia-salts alone, with a somewhat larger total
number of gramineous species represented in the samples, only nine came into the list
as yielding more than 1 per cent. in any one year, whilst on plot 4-2, with the
superphosphate in addition, there were 12 that came into this category. The
result, was a somewhab more mixed herbage 80 far as the gramineous components were
concerned, due, however, it is to be supposed, rather to more of maturing tendency,
and therefore of consolidation, giving weight, than to increased luxuriance of the
species which came the more into prominence. Among the five Miscellanees coming into the foremost lis, Rumex Acetosa was, as
in other cases, by far the most prominent ; next in order coming Achillea Millefolium,
Conopodium denudatum, Centaurea nigra, and various species of Ranunculus.
