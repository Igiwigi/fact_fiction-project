A limb traversed by the direct current may be compared to a limb fatigued by re-
peated efforts. The inverse current may be supposed to act in an opposite manner,
and during its passage the neryous force might accumulate in the nerye.

I prefer, however, suppressing considerations of this nature on account of the vague
and uncertain impression which they are calculated to leave in a reflecting mind.

It may not, however, be without some utility to close my electro-physiological
researches with an attempt at embracing, under some general views, the phenomena
of muscular contraction, of the production of electricity in fish, and of the relation
between the electric current and neryous influence.

I would here recall the facts discovered by M. Loxcer and myself, on treating the
motor nerves with the electric current. Monsieur LoxcGgr and myself discovered that
the action of the electric current upon these nerves was precisely the opposite of its
action upon the mixed nerves.

The direct current acting upon the motor nerves, determines the contraction in the
second period of the excitability of these nerves when it ceases to pass, and the in-
verse current produces it when it begins to pass. It is natural to think that the
phenomenon of tetanic contraction would be produced by the cessation of the direct
current when the motor nerves are acted upon. In connexion with this subject, I
will here relate a phenomenon which I have lately discovered, and which appears to
me to be worthy of remark. With the aid of a wheel armed with insulating metallic
teeth, similar to that of Mons. Masson, I passed a current in a frog prepared in the
