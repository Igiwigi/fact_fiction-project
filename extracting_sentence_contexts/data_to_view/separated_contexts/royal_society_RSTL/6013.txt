The association was distinct ;
any friend Professor Ramsay was with me at the time; I drew his attention to the fact. Sand to him the case was perfectly conclusive. Thus the Aletsch glacier, which had
Sheen referred to by Mr. Barr as furnishing evidence against the pressure theory, gave
Sus a fact, which, as far as I could see, was perfectly fatal to the theory of stratiti-
Zeation. But the case was solitary, and although inspiriting at the moment, its effect upon the
ER became feeble as time passed, and no repetition of the observation occurred. 1
Shad remained at the Riffel from the 9th to the 18th of August, exploring all the adja-
Scent glaciers, and adding each day to my stock of knowledge ; but I met no case in which
Sthe structure and the bedding were s0 clearly and independently exhibited, as to leave
Zan adherent of the stratification theory no room for doubt.
