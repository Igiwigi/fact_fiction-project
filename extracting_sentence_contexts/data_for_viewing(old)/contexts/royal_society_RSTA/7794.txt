shall exceed 8m? considerably. The following table gives some representative values
showing n,, the maximum number of observations that may be expected to avoid slow
convergence, and 1, 3m?) the number that must be exceeded if any determination
of such a value of m is to be possible.

If in fact m — 25, we shall need well over 2000 observations to detect it; but in 650

observations there will ordinarily be some beyond the range where the series gives

a satisfactory approximation. It will be only at such large values of m that the number
of observations needed to show that m is not infinite will be 10,000 or more that the
approximation by series will be of any use. The trouble is that it is biased in dealing
with the outlying observations, which are precisely the ones of most use in finding m.

We can illustrate this from the above series. The danger line is at x—a — }0,/(2M),
and the series will diverge beyond o/(2./), We tabulate the latter and the departure
of the extreme observation from the mean.
