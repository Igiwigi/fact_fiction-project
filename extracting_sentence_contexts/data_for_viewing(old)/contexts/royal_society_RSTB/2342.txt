254 DR. H. T. BROWN AND MR. F. ESCOMBE ON STATIC DIFFUSION OF

the existence of a system of overlying equi-density shells brought into existence
by the converging streams of the gas on their way to the absorbing surface.

There is, however, one important difference between the behaviour of absorbing
dises, and of perforations in a septum dividing two regions of different density. In
the former case, as we have just seen, the absorption, according to linear dimensions,
is extremely sensitive to any disturbance which may be supposed to affect the
stability of the overlying “ shells,’ whereas in the case of a perforated diaphragm,
through which, for instance, atmospheric carbon dioxide is diffusing, no special pre-
cautions to keep the outer air quite still are requisite; in fact, we may obtain good
indications of the “ diameter law” under these conditions from air which is in distinct
movement, a movement far more than sufficient to sweep away and destroy the
efficacy of any shells over an absorbing alkaline solution of the same shape and
size.

In the case of the absorbent disc, the convergent hyperbolic lines of flux of the
carbon dioxide all terminate in the surface of the disc, and normal to it, where they
are trapped by the absorbent. (See fig. 1, p. 256.) With the perforated diaphragm, on
the other hand, the lines of flow, which are convergent as they approach the disc, bend
round their foci, situated in the edges of the dise, and form a divergent system on the
other side. If the chamber into which they pass is a perfectly absorbent one, and is
sufficiently large, we shall have formed on the inner side of the diaphragm a system
