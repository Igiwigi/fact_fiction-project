The nuclei are, as has been said, of a large size, and they contain one or more
nucleoli, together with a beautifully clear chromatic network, which is even at this
stage seen to be markedly polarised (figs. 2, 3). Commonly, at the same time, a

single centrosphere can be seen at one side of the nucleus, though it is not always
definitely related to the polarisation of the chromatic thread. Later on a second
centrosphere becomes visible ; and from the fact that the two are not always situated
at 180° apart from each other, it might be inferred that they have had a common
origin ; but we have never been able to satisfy ourselves as to this, either in this or in
the other divisions. Indced, in some cases it seemed almost certain that the second
one was formed independently of the first, and was differentiated ab initio at some
distance from it.
<= The chromatic thread is now seen to be double in many places, indicating a longi-
Studinal fission ; but the object is too small, and the various steps are gone through too
rapidly to permit of this point being investigated by us in greater detail. We are,
