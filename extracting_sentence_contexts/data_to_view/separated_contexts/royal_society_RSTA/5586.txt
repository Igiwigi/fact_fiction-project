Hence, in this work, the UAV is assumed
to be sufficiently stiff to justify its representation by a 6-d.f. rigid body, equipped with deployable
control surfaces. This assumption is appropriate, as it is satisfied by many UAVs, particularly in
the context of landing. Linearization is also justified by the fact that the controller can be expected



to maintain the UAV within small perturbations about a pre-designed glideslope, except if it 4 |
has to deal with an exogenous event just before touchdownâ€”a scenario that is not considered

in this work. On the other hand, linearization about a steady-state equilibrium point would 3
not be effective in this case, because the fluid state at such a point is time-dependent. For this oS
reason, a more suitable linearization is performed instead.
