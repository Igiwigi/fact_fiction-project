(2.) The magnetic moment of each member of the suspended system should be a
maximum.
S (3.) The mirror should, if possible, be so good that its defining power is only limited
its size; it should be optically perfect.
"E (4.) The optical magnification should be a maximum.
2.(5.) The astaticism of the suspended system should be a maximum.
6.) The field in which the suspended system moves should be zero when the
astaticism is perfect, and the directional force entirely due to the unavoidable torsion
rad the suspending fibre. Since the astaticism is never perfect, and the field can never
& zero, the torsion of the suspended fibre can only operate so as to reduce the sensi-
Breness, and must therefore be made as nearly zero as possible.
74 It is obvious that the above conditions are partially incompatible, and, as a matter
“Sf fact, it is the last condition which provides a starting-point.
& The line of argument is this. In order to prevent changes of zero, we are compelled
‘ use quartz threads. These threads are, however, very stiff. In order to prevent
‘the stiffness being such as to seriously affect the sensitiveness, the threads must be
Eery fine, and, consequently, the suspended apparatus very light. In order to go
jeyond this, it becomes necessary to determine to what point the optical sensitiveness

Salue of the fluctuations of the zero, Under fixed conditions, the weight of the
Shirror will simply depend on the defining power required. The maker must take
Bito account (1) the optical limit as to smallness, depending on the wave-length of
ght; and (2) the fact that the mirror must be thick enough neither to deform under
own weight, nor to deform owing to the freeing of internal stresses during its
Fhanufacture. Before exact theory can be applied to the construction of a galvano-
