Classificatory Relationship of Siderastrea.

The microscopic structure of a single trabecula is, as we have seen, identical in the
genus Siderastrea, and in genera belonging to the sub-family Pseudoastreine, PRrarz.
Fungia on the other hand shows secondary thickening in the form of new centres
of calcification developed on the side surfaces of the septa in connection with the
synapticular granulations. This is, however, a feature correlated with the low form
of the #ungia corallum, and the fact that the soft tissues remain in the canalicular
portions of the ccelenteron throughout the life of the polyp; it is, therefore, not a
feature in itself of classificatory distinction between fungia and Siderastrea. In
spite of the dissimilarity in the form of the corallum in those two genera, the
agreement in all essential structural features is undoubted. Recapitulating briefly,
the septa both of £ungia* and Siderastrea are typically compact, and have granu-
late surfaces, the miscroscopic structure showing that the septa are composed of
trabeculee which may diverge from one another in the space of a single septal ridge ;
whereas, in the Pseudoastrewine, the trabecule composing a septal ridge are
absolutely parallel throughout the whole course of that ridge. The only mode by
which adjaceut ridges can coalesce in the latter case is by means of elongation of the
fibres in the septal plane. This elongation takes place at regular intervals between
successive growth-periods in the Pseudoastraine, and the result is a series of regular
