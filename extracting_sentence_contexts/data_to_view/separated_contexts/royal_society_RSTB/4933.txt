Can.,’ vol. 5, Section TV (1911). t It is just possible that the stimulus acts on the young products on the tracheary side of the cambium,
our reason for stating this being the fact that we have just recently found that formic acid when inserted
into a wound travels far up the tissues, evidently in the upward current in the wood, and results in
production of resin canals many times farther above the seat of injury than below it. However, the
stimulus does produce a result on both sides of the cambium, and our conclusion holds independently
of this debatable feature, which has, however, a very distinct bearing on the “damming up’ theory,

and that of the vertical series.
