The youngest dentine-papilla is a simple hemispherical eminence; that next in age
is conical, while above this point the characteristic form of the future tooth is more
closely approached.

In the youngest dentine-germs of the dogfish the cells near to the surface are larger
than those more deeply situated, and measure about gg4;5 of an inch in length ; in older
germs the larger size and greater abundance of the cells upon the surface is noteworthy,
but nothing at all comparable to the distinct odontoblast layer or membrana eboris,
characteristic of the formative organs of hard unvascular dentine, is met with.

It is not, however, 80 much in the dentine-papillee as in their epithelium that the chief
interest lies, especially when the facts described by myself in a former communication
upon the development of the teeth in Batrachia and ReptiliaF are kept in view for the
sake of comparison.

Tracing the epithelium downwards from the exposed convex surface of the jaw (, fig. 1)
it is 8een, opposite to the interspace between the third and fourth teeth, to leave the
Jaw and spring across to inyest the thecal fold. In the specimen figured it has been
