Threshold error in voltage u for observation error standard deviations of 0.05 (black) and 0.1 (red). As the observation : >
error increases, the error in the analysis increases as well. (Online version in colour.) ia

Even with the larger error the LETKF reduces the analysis error, although the error reduction
is not as swift and the analysis error using 0.1 observation error does not reach the same low
levels as using 0.05 observation error (figure 5). The observation error gives a theoretical limit on
the possible accuracy of the analysis, so the fact that a larger observation error leads to a large
analysis error not surprising. What is encouraging is that the larger observation error does not
appear to change the overall effectiveness of the LETKF in reducing the analysis error.

(c) Model error cases

In the remaining scenarios, we consider cases in which the numerical prediction model is different
from the model used as the truth. Here, we consider only cases in which model parameters were
changed, but it is possible to use an entirely different model for the truth (for example, we used
the Beeler—Reuter for some studies in [65]) or to use experimental data for the observations.

(i) Electrophysiological parameter: excitability

To obtain some insights into the effects of varying an electrophysiological parameter, we
considered the excitability ty, which has strong dynamical effects on conduction velocity,
wavelength, and other properties.
