60 DR. J. S. RISIEN RUSSELL ON THE INFLUENCE

I. Introduction.

I HAVE much pleasure in thanking Professor Vicror Horstey for allowing me
to conduct the experiments which form the subject of this paper at the Pathological
Laboratory of University College. -

It has always appeared to me contrary to the best established facts with regard to
the cerebral localisation of motor processes that some abduction of the vocal cords
should not be represented in the cerebral cortex. That abduction should be less
powerfully represented in the cortex than adduction seemed clear, but that there
should be no centre at all to subserve this function in the cerebral cortex seemed
strange. I therefore decided to test the matter on the lines suggested to me by
Dr. Hucutincs JAcKson in connection with a recent investigation of eye movements,
when, after excluding the possibility of the lateral movements of the eyes to the
opposite side from the hemisphere stimulated taking place, by dividing the muscles
which bring about these movements, I found that it was possible to evoke many other
movements of the eyes which hitherto could not be obtained. The conclusion which
appeared warranted by these results was that the lateral movements of the eyes are
so powerfully represented in the cerebral cortex that they overpower all other move-
