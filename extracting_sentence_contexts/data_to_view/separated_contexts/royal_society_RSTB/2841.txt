[PLaTE 6.]

I. Introductory. I have recently pointed out (1) (2) (3) that if a small wound, removing a patch of
epidermal cells, is made on the leaf or stem of certain host-plants, and conidia or
ascospores of certain species of the Hrysiphacee are sown on the cells of the internal
tissues thus exposed, vigorous infection will take place, and in a few days the surface
of the wound will be covered by a mycelium bearing densely clustered conidiophores
with ripe conidia. The fact was somewhat surprising, since the fungi in question are confined
normally to the external surface of the epidermal cells. It was desirable to ascertain
the details of the growth of the fungus under these abnormal conditions, and to
discover to what extent the hyphe of the mycelium penetrated into the intercellular
spaces of the internal tissues, and especially whether haustoria, normal or otherwise,
were produced, and if so, in what cells they were formed. Before describing the experiments carried out with the object of determining these
points, and the results obtained, it will be convenient to give first a brief account of
our present knowledge of the mycelial characteristics of the Erysiphacee in relation
to their parasitic habit.
