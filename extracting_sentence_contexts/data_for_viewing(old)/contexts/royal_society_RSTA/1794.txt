Figure 4. Long-time comparison of Stehfest and pole extraction methods to NILT for (a) Carbon and (b) Stainless Steel. Only
the first pole is used for each q; eigenvalue.

Hence, the thickness and location of the wall loss can be derived from the combination of
amplitude in the short-time domain and decay rate (curve inclination) in the long-time domain.

From the depicted results, it is easily derived that the pole extraction can be used for calibration
of instruments that use PEC for thickness measurements. The fact that the presented model
describes the exact cylindrical configuration improves the method accuracy since no planar
geometry simplification is used.
