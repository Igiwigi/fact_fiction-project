For the fields typical of the ALPHA-1 and -2 magnets, the antihydrogen magnetic moment
Hy is approximately 0.670KT~1, and results in a trap depth of approximately 540mK for
antihydrogen atoms born at the centre of the magnetic volume. In these traps, antihydrogen
atoms are confined vertically primarily by the field gradient of the octupole, making the
gravitational potential difference across the trap approximately 50|1K over the approximately
44mm height of the trap. Antihydrogen will tend to be deflected vertically by the additional
gravitational dependence, which in principle can be measured with our position-sensitive
detector.

The gravitational analysis involved calculating the reverse cumulative averages (RCA) (x|t)
and (y|t) for antihydrogen annihilation positions as a function of time f during the trap ramp-
down. This choice of measure aimed to weigh the fact that events occurring at later times during
the magnet ramp, though fewer in number, will deflect more by the gravitational potential as they
possess a lower energy. A detailed comparison between the experimental distribution measured
in ALPHA-1 against extensive simulations for different test values of F was made. Figure 3 shows
an example of the RCA of annihilation positions compared against simulations for F = +150. The
RCA distributions from the real data are tested for incompatibility with simulated data in order
to create a bound on F. With this approach, we excluded F < —12 and F > 75 at the 95% certainty
level. Worst-case scenarios for possible systematic errors moved these bounds to F < —65 and
F>110 [18].

As a proof-of-principle experiment, this analysis activity served to identify the key areas of
improvement required to achieve a better measurement on F. The dataset used in the above
analysis included 434 antihydrogen atoms that are consistent with sampling from the cold (less
