We conclude that limy_, +50 1; = 0. Moreover, it has been proved in lemma 2.2,
see equation (2.10), that limy_, 4.0 I, =0. For the last term, we have, using the fact that W is
bounded in L®, that, for some non-negative constant C,

Ik < Cf yrzpa 2 = Up. >o}) + 1 = Upp pn /2))1p.>0}) a. We have shown in the fourth step above that Uppy>py/2) converges weakly towards 1p.>0}- Then
passing to the limit k > +00 in the latter inequality, we deduce that limy_, +55 I, =0. We conclude
from (2.27) that, for any open bounded subset U,
