In fact, in the case of the alkalies, the a
are not far from being proportional to v, 2v, 2v, 3v, for the four elements considered,
but the data are so inexact and uncertain that it seems not worth while to undertake
an exhaustive numerical discussion. We do not know that the chief lines of these sets are those depending on m = 3. Tf lines exist depending on m = 2 they would all be in extremest red, in fact with
wave-lengths comparable with those of electro-magnetic waves capable of being
experimentally excited, and it is possible that VF (2) might be the same for all low
melting-point elements and as for He (see [I.]). For m= 1 we should expect the
lines of negative wave number in regions which have been observed and in which no
such lines have been seen. The F series in the high melting-point elements, on the contrary, are profoundly
influenced by the atomic weight term.
