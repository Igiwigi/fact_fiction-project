However,
as some parts of my apparatus might contribute to that un-
certainty, I intend to correct it, and repeat the experiment ;
which, if T obtain regular results, I shall have the honour to
communicate to the Royal Society. I have now summed up the series bf propositions which
connect together in one system the whole of the fundamental
phznomena of hygrology and hygrometry ; and the only
part of that system which remained to be proved by imme-
diate experiments is, that link mentioned above between the
two classes of phanomena, namely ; « That in vacuo, as in air,
« the product of evaporation affects the hygroscope as it
« does the manometer.” I had ascertained that fact since
the year 1776, by immediate experiments ; which was the
reason why, in my last work, I considered that circumstance
as a principle, which, at least, could not be denied by any
thing known to the contrary. But, for an immediate demon-
stration of it, many conditions were wanting in my first ex-
periment, which could not be obtained but by the whole of

my subsequent labour. That experiment is now made with
a sufficient degree of regularity ; and the more 80, as it has
been executed by Mr. Haas, in one of his air-pumps, with
some of my whale-bone hygrometers, made by himself : and
I shall now give its result.
