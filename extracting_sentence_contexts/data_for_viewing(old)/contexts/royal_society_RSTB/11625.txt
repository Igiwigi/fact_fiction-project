recognition that carefully crafted media portrayals can have a
positive influence on children’s understanding of death
[6,52,58,59]. For example, there is a small children’s literature
on death education, aimed at providing facts about death
and suggesting ways to cope and normalize grief [59]. Clini-
cians and educators recognize the value of these books both
in promoting children’s understanding of the realities of
death and in stimulating communication between children
and their parents [59]. In the USA, a now-famous episode of
the children’s television show Mister Rogers’ neighbourhood
focused on the death of a goldfish [60,61]. This episode ‘dealt
with death in a low-anxiety situation’ [60, p. 183] and was
explicit in providing factual information about the death
sub-concepts of irreversibility, universality and cessation. The
producers received numerous letters from parents and children
expressing thanks for the programme and providing examples
of how the programme helped them deal with the realities of
death [60]. The programme was repeated several times over
the next few years. More recently, an episode of the Sesame
Street television show, entitled ‘Farewell Mr Hooper’ centred
around the death of a popular (human) character in the show
[62]. The episode portrays frank and factual discussions
about death and grief. Shortly after the 2012 Sandy Hook mas-
sacre in the USA, the episode went viral as parents sought a
way to help explain death and dying to their children [63].
