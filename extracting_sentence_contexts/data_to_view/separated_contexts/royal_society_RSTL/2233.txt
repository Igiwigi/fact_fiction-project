The structure of those general
organs, which are adapted to the functions of whole classes of
animals, has, in all their modifications, been again and again
examined and described ; and in many instances little perhaps
remains to be ascertained. But with regard to those-secre-
tions which belong to individual species, or to smaller groups,
and which are formed only for the performance of a function
required by their peculiar and exclusive habits, comparatively
little information has hitherto been acquired. A detailed
examination of each individual structure will be necessary to
the establishment of any correct general views, or accurate
classification of them ; and every discovery, even of an
isolated fact, exclusive of what individual interest it may
possess, becomes of increased importance, from its possible
relations to other analogous structures. In order to illustrate
the truth of this remark, it is only necessary to refer to the
laborious and profound investigations of SIR EVERARD Home,
whose Papers in the Philosophical Transactions have so much


Mr. BELL on the structure and use, &c. 133

extended our information on some of the most intricate
subjects of comparative anatomy and physiology —the result
principally of a minute examination of individual and peculiar
structures.
