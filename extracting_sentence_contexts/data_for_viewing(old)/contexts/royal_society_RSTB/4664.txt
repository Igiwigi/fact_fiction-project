and he put forward the view that the zoospores were responsible for the further
distribution of the organism through the tumour by the ability which he believed
they possessed of boring their way through the walls of the host cell into the
adjoining cells. The fungus probably existed in England many years before
ScHILBERSZKY’S paper was written, but its presence in this country was not generally
recognised, In 1902 Porrer (36) published a short paper on the organism. He
there showed that resting sporangia, which had been kept dry during the winter,
were able to cause the infection of tubers the next season. The distribution of the
organism through the tumour he attributed to its division, when in a condition which
he describes as plasmodial, and to the passage of the segments so produced through
the walls into the adjacent cells.

For several years after Porrer’s publication appeared few facts were added to the
existing knowledge of the disease, but in 1907 Bortawick (4) reported that leaves
could be attacked as well as tubers. In the following year, Saumon (42) carried out
a series of infection experiments, from the results of which he concluded that resting
sporangia, after exposure for 12 hours to a temperature ranging from —5° C. to
—6° C., could dispense with the winter dormancy and germinate at once. Shortly
afterwards two notes appeared, one from the pen of JoHNsoN (16) and the other from
that of Wnutss (49). Both succeeded in obtaining the germination of the resting
sporangium, and, in addition, Jounson found that the zoospores liberated exhibited
the usual characteristics of the Chytridian zoospore, while Weiss remarked upon the
