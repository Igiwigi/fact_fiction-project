The elimination of the second equivalent of bromine by silver-salts, which
= takes place instantly and completely in alkaline liquids, may likewise be effected by
S continual ebullition in neutral and even in acid s0lutions, though always slowly and
Z incompletely. If the bromide be precipitated by excess of nitrate of silver, the filtered
Ss liquid, on being boiled and evaporated, deposits a fresh quantity of bromide of silver ;
E but in most cases, even after long-continued boiling, a considerable quantity of bromine
8 remains latent, and may be immediately recognized by again filtering the liquid and
Slightly supersaturating it with ammonia, the whole of the remaining bromine being
then precipitated as bromide of silyer. This deportment furnishes in fact a character-
istic distinction of the bromethylated bromide, by which this substance may often be
conveniently recognized, It deserves to be remarked that the fixed caustic alkalies exert
but a slight action on the bromethylated bromide; the compound is precipitated by
the alkalies from its cold aqueous s0lution in the crystalline state and without decompo-
Sition, and it is only after some time that alterations take place, probably affecting its
intimate constitution. The nature of these alterations has not yet been made out. The
crystals may be boiled for some time with alcoholic solution of potassa without decom-
position.
