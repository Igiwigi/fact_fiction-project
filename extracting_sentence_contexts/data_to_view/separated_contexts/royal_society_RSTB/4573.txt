As is shown in Section 2 (e)
below, Cidaris has but feeble powers of adhesion by means of its podia, relying more
on its long radioles for protection and entanglement. No advance which involved
exposure to rough treatment by waves or adversaries was possible for an organism
endowed with so mechanically unsound a fabric. In ambulacral structure, as in most other morphological features, the Cidaridze
have maintained that conservatism of type that characterises the root-stocks of most

classes of animals; and this fact alone is sufficient reason for the reference of all more
elaborate developments back to the Cidaroid ambulacrum as a starting-point.

(e) The Diademoida.*

The non-Cidaroid Euechinoidea Regularia comprise a large and varied series of
forms which have been, on the whole, markedly progressive in evolution from their
inception in Triassic times to the present day.” While differing from the Cidaroida by
many obvious characters, the Diademoida show a steadily increasing contrast in their
ambulacral structure.. The areas become wider than in Cidaris, lose their sinuous
character, and come to support tubercles equal in size to those of the interambulacra. Moreover, a considerable increase in the number of podia in a column (and thus inevit-
ably of plates) is achieved ; and hence the mechanical difficulties incumbent upon the
Paleozoic Echinoidea demand solution anew. ‘The displacement of the pore-pairs
from a uniserial course is essential if any strain is to be applied to the test in
their neighbourhood, and the more advanced Diademoida can exert the function of
podial adhesion to a remarkable degree.
