THE HISTORY OF EXPLOSIVE AGENTS, 349

that length and diameter: a perfect detonation was in one instance produced when this
charge was used in a tube only 9 inches long ; but in others, with tubes of this length
and diameter, the detonation was also only partial.

Through a tube only 6 inches long detonation was accomplished by means of 108
grains (7 grms.) of fulminate; but the result was doubtful with 100 grains (6:5 grms. ).
It therefore appears that in order to accomplish the detonation of gun-cotton through
the medium of transmission afforded by a narrow tube, at a distance of not more than
6 inches, it is necessary to use at least fifty times the quantity of fulminate, strongly
confined, which is required to ensure detonation when the © detonator” is in clos6 con-
tact with the charge. This result presents a marked contrast to the fact demonstrated
by the experiments described in the transmission of the detonation of gun-cotton from
one mass to another, through the agency of tubes,—that the detonation of 0:5 ounce
(14:2 grms.) of compressed gun-cotton will induce that of another mass of gun-cotton
if separated from it by a tube, of a particular diameter and thickness, 2 feet in length,
the distance which thus separates the two masses being about ninety times greater than
that through which the detonation of 0:5 ounce of gun-cotton, exposed in all directions,
could accomplish the explosion of another mass of the compressed material.

1f, however, the quantity of confined mercuric fulminate employed as the initiative
charge be increased not yery considerably beyond that (154 grains=10 grms.) which
is only just sufficient to detonate gun-cotton through a tube 1 inch (025 m.) in
diameter and 9 inches long, very different results are obtained. 219 grains (0'5 ounce
