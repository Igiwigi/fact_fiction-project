Where they are more
numerous, we find the reason is, that certain of the single medullary bundles are [
replaced by a pair (see Plate 21, fig. 1). The alternation, however, is always preserved,

That the medullary bundles are continuous with the cortical leaf-traces is proved â€”

by the fact that we often find bundles in the intermediate position, in the act of passing
out from pith to pericycle. If, as is almost always the case, the stem po
secondary tissues, the bundle is here enclosed by the secondary wood, which has
formed on its outer side only, while behind it is a parenchymatous gap (see Plate 23,
fig. 9). We find examples of these transitional bundles in all positions between pith
and pericycle.
