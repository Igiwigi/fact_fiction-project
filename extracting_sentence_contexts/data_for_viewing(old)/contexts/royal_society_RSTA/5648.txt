thus has the same origin as the non-vanishing drag for flow past finite solid bodies and analogous
flow phenomena are observed near the roughness elements, such as separating boundary layers
and pressure asymmetry [30,42,43]. As recently shown [44] (also [45]), the associated form drag
must in fact be due to a flux of spanwise vorticity across the streamwise flow. Although the
viscous drag becomes negligible in the limit, it is again observed to vanish more slowly than
1/Re so that the wall-normal derivatives du/dn must diverge as Re > oo.

These divergences of velocity-gradients at the wall, as well as the additional divergences in the
interior, can be described as an ‘ultraviolet catastrophe’. They imply that a naive interpretation
of the fluid equations (2.1) as partial differential equations is no longer possible when Re — oo.
As in quantum field theory and critical phenomena, the development of a valid dynamical
description in that limit requires a regularization of these divergences [24]. Regularizing by a
suitable ‘coarse-graining’ operation, the resulting regularized dynamics in fact corresponds to
what in mathematics is called a weak formulation of the fluid equations: see [46], §2 or [25]. In this
formulation, one may pass to the limit Re oo and, under physically reasonable assumptions
consistent with observations, the limits (along suitable subsequences) exist and are described as
weak Euler solutions [47], in agreement with the ideas of Taylor and Onsager. In the following
section, we explain in physical terms the regularization that has been employed in the recent
mathematical literature on wall-bounded flows [1-4] and explore its consequences.

3. Onsager RG approach and inertial drag force

To regularize divergences of gradients in the interior, a spatial coarse-graining /low-pass
filtering /mollifying operator may be applied to the velocity field by convolving it with a smooth
filter kernel G;(r) = ¢-3G(r/£), denoted ty = Gy * u, which corresponds to ignoring eddies of size
