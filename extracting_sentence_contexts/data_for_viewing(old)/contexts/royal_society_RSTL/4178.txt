Olefiant Gas. â€”When this gas is prepared by heating sulphuric acid, of specific
gravity 16, with strong alcohol at the temperature of 320?, in the proportion of six
parts of the former to one of the latter, it appears to come off at first very pure, as it is
entirely absorbed by the perchloride of antimony, and contains therefore no carbonic
oxide. But it is really contaminated, I find, by a portion of another heavier gas or
vapour (not ether vapour), which cannot be entirely removed from it by washing with
alkaline water, oil of vitriol, or strong alcobol, and which may raise the density of the
gas above that of air. As the evolution of gas proceeds, the proportion of the heavy
compound diminishes, and it finally disappears, and the gas attains its theoretical
density ; but it is then again contaminated with more or less carbonic oxide. The
latter gas, however, being of sensibly the same density as olefiant gas, is not likely
to exert any influence upon its effusion rate. But, before these facts were ascertained
this jet became unserviceable from an accident, and the experiments made with it
were all made npon the dense olefiant gas, and gave an effusjon time which slightly
exceeded that of air.

2, Effusion into a Vacuum by a perforated brass plate A.

A minute circular aperture was made by means of a fine drill in a thin. plate-of
sheet brass z4;zth of an inch thick, and the opening till further diminished by blows
from a small hammer, of which the surface was rounded, - A s8mall disc of the brass
plate was then punched out, having the aperture in the centre, which was soldered
upon the end of a short- piece of brass tube, of quill size, 80 as to. close the end of
the cylinder. This brass tube was then fixed, by-means' of a; perforated cork, within
