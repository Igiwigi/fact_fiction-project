The combination
4s?Sâ€”6p2P? at A1817 can then be calculated, and it is found that the observed wave-number
is too large by about 2cm.~!. The explanation lies in the fact that the centre of gravity of
2392 is this same amount longer than the reversal. Probably there is a reversal in 1817
at the correct position at one side of the emission, but it is not observable with the means
available. Both measured and calculated wave-lengths of A1817 are given in the table.
