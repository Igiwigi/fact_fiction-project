The epineural
sinus ends blindly in front and does not extend forwards around the oesophagus. Also it is from the
epineural space into the cirri, and not the reverse, which, as I shall show later, represents the direction
of blood flow. The big blood space which he describes around the adductor muscle does not, in fact,
exist. More recently Broch 1927 (in Kiikenthal, p. 518) has published a short statement on the cirripede
blood system. He adds nothing except a statement that in the ‘more highly organised forms’ blood
collects in a ventral sinus on either side, which opens in the rostral sinus.
