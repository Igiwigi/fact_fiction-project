great hydraulic work, published in 1779 and 1786, contains a series of the most
valuable obseryations, whose results accord very nearly with the new formula
of the motion of water in pipes and open conduits ; and his experiments, with
pipes inclined in various angles from the 40,000th part of a right angle to 90
degrees, and in channels which yaried from a line and a half in diameter to
areas of seyen or eight square toises, seem to comprehend every case of in-
clination ; 80 that by collecting a prodigious number of facts, both with com-
pressible and incompressible fluids, he obtained a general expression for all
cases relative to the friction and cohesion of fluids : but a logarithmic function
which he introduces in it, by a sort of approximation, gives it a character of
uncertainty, which restrains its use, and shows the necessity of fresh researches.

the expenditure of differently shaped orifices and tubes, but particularly on the
lateral communication of motion by the cohesion of fluids. CovLoms first
approximated to the solution of the question, by a yery ingenious apparatus,
consisting of discs of different sizes, fixed by their centres to the lower extre-
mity of a brass wire, and made to oscillate in fluids by the force of torsion
only; he concluded that the resistance was a function, composed of two terms,
