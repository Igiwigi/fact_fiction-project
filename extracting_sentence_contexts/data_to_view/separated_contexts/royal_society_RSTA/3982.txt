The image has attracted a certain
mythology over the years and several astronomy books declare confidently that it was rushed to
the Great Exhibition in London to be admired. The source for the story is opaque and the records
for the exhibition show no clear evidence to confirm it. More central to the history of eclipse photography is the fact that the Science Museum
collection includes the Kew Photoheliograph (figure 25). This was the first astronomical
instrument specifically designed for photographing celestial objects. Designed for the Royal
Society by Warren de la Rue in 1857, it was built by instrument maker Andrew Ross, London.
