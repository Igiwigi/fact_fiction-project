here that these indicators measure the relative costs implied by the physical parameters (e.g.
impedances, capacity ratings, topology, etc.) and security constraints of any single area. We note

first that area C has the smallest absolute value of economic loss. This is the area exporting the
most, figure 3, thanks to the cheapest available generation resources. The interpretation of the
smallest economic loss indicator (i.e. smallest difference in cost when neglecting the physical
parameters & security limitations of this area) relates to this fact. There is still a large security
management cost to pay in order to get the cheap power coming out of area C to the loads located
in areas A,B of the interconnected system. It is the cost of keeping areas A,B as well as the system
interconnection capacity N-1 secure. Conversely, importing area A has the largest absolute value
of economic loss. This loss is associated with the security of the intra-area transmission network
between the loads in area A and the exporting areas B, C. Without this intra-area network, it
would be much cheaper to securely serve the area A loads.

Figure 4b plots the economic benefit indicators for the three areas of the test-system. We recall
here that these indicators measure the value of the grid flexibility inside each area to the multi-
area system. We start again from area C to discuss the zero value attached to the PST inside this
area. In our detailed results, we have noted that the settings of this PST that would be chosen
independently by the area C TSO (assuming the ideal simplification of the rest of the network)
