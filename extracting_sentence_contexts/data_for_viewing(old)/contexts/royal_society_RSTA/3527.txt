are surprisingly good and are encouraging for potential use in gravity wave detectors. Figure 2
illustrates the frequency stability of current optical atomic frequency references and compact
optical cavities, and what could be achievable by pushing towards the range of interest for GW
detectors.

Ytterbium clock transitions are also interesting candidates as a stable optical phase reference
because they have several isotopes with reasonable abundance, including both fermions and
bosons. !7Yb has a particularly simple spin-% nucleus, and the even isotopes with zero nuclear
spin (Yb, W74yYp, 176Yp) have narrow clock transitions with linewidths that can be tuned using
the method of magnetic-field-induced forbidden transitions [22].

Arguably, it is unreasonably ambitious to extrapolate so far beyond the current state-of-the-art
performance of atomic frequency references, but the fact that there is real new GW science that
requires 20+ digits of phase measurement capability means that there is good reason to push
