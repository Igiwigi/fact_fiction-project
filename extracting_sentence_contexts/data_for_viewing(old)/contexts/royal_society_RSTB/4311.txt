MEASLES EPIDEMICS IN LONDON BY THE METHOD OF THE PERIODOGRAM. 245

demonstrate also that two or more epidemics with different periodicities may run
concurrently. Any but a biological explanation of these phenomena seems to me
untenable, and the facts further seem to prove that the periodicity is infinitely more
probably due to such changes as may easily constitute the life-cycle of an infecting
organism rather than to periodic changes in the susceptibility of the host. To explain
the phenomenon by the number of susceptible persons present in the population at
any one time seems hardly possible.
The influence of the climatic variation of the solar year has had more darkness than
light thrown upon it by the present investigation. That there is a seasonal influence
is undoubted but the relationship is not simple as has been commonly supposed, but
S much more complex. A considerable part of the influence.seems to be due to the fact

that it is not unusual for the complete cycle of the life-history of the measles organism
2 to correspond almost exactly with a multiple of the solar year, in itself a suggestive
5 coincidence, but even if this has been fully allowed for something remains which
a requires further analysis. I hope some day to discuss these problems, but when it is
¢ remembered that, even with a disease such as summer diarrhoea, in which the
‘ dependence of the size of the epidemic on the degree of summer temperature is
=» Obvious, no one has succeeded in demonstrating any simple connection, it is possible
z that the explanation of the relationship of epidemics of measles to the solar year may
‘6 yet be far in the future.
