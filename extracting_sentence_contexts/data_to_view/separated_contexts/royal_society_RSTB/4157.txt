The occurrence in Embryo 8 of Ornithorhynchus of a definite and large
mammalian vomer having no connection with and lying in a different plane from
that of the os paradoxum shows that this bone cannot be the fused prevomers.

38. The actual relation of the anterior end of the vomer in Macropus and
Dasyurus to the paraseptal cartilage is not that which we should expect if that bone
be really the fused prevomers, but appears to be a secondary one.

39. The vomer of Ornithorhynchus has a very similar position to the rostral part
of the parasphenoid of reptiles, a fact which is inconsistent with Gavrr’s view that
the crus longus of the parasphenoid has disappeared in mammals owing to the
complete ossification of the base of the skull.

40, The occurrence of a large parasphenoid in all Therapsids in which the condi-
tions are accurately known renders it very unlikely that this bone should have
completely disappeared in mammals.

41. The development of the ossicula auditus in Ornithorhynchus adds nothing to
the completeness of the case for Retcuert’s theory that Gaupr has recently
summarised.

42. It is suggested that the ossiculus acessorium malleoli may be the reptilian
3 surangular,
