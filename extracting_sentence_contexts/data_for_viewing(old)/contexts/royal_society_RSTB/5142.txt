much variation in this respect in different fibres and in different parts of the same
fibre (fig. 29, Plate 33).

The fibres may branch dichotomously either before leaving the ganglion of origin
or at the points of intersection of the interganglionic fibre-tracts, when each branch
takes a separate course in one of the latter. In other cases (e.g., fig. 10) they may pass
to their destination without previous branching. The determination of these processes
as axones or dendrites is only possible when they can be followed to their endings. The
dendrites run to other ganglia more or less adjacent to their seat of origin. There they
form a delicate varicose plexus, the fibres of which terminate in minute knob-like
swellings either on the surfaces of the bodies of other nerve cells or in an apparently diffuse
fashion in the intercellular spaces (fig. 21, Plate 31), though it may be that this latter
appearance is simply due to the fact that the related cell-bodies are unstained. The
axone, on the other hand, usually enters a fibre-bundle and may run in that for a long
distance, even passing through other ganglia. In its course it may divide, and eventually

it passes out to the muscle coat, where it terminates in relation to the muscle fibres.
If we take the cell in fig. 9 as an example, we find that the cell has three processes. Of
these process I (axonic), after entering one of the related fibre-bundles, divides and the
branches, after pursuing a separate course, run out to terminate in the muscle coat ;
process II (dendritic) is almost immediately lost to view in the fibre-tract ; whilst
process III (dendritic) breaks up into three branches in the ganglion of origin and these
