The relations between coordinates and contraordinates are as follows ;—

Through an origin O let any three axes pass, right or oblique. Let R be any point,
and let OR

Through R draw three planes, parallel respectively to the three coordinate planes,
and intersecting the axes respectively in the points X, Y, Z. Also, on OR, as a dia-
meter, describe a sphere, intersecting the axes respectively in U, V, W. Then will
ON=a,OY=9, n.0Z=z
be the coordinates of R, as usnal, and
OU=u, OV=v, OW=w
its contraordinates, being, in fact, the projections of OR on the three axes.
For rectangular axes, coordinates and contraordinates are identical.
Coordinates and Contraordinates are connected þby the following equation :—

In the language of Mr. SyLvssTER, a system of Coordinates and the concomitant
system of Contraordinates are mutually Contragredient ; and the square of the radius-
vector is their universal mixed concomitant.
Let the cosines of the angles made by the axes with each other be denoted as
follows :— cosyO2=c,; cos zOr=c,; cos vOy=c,;
then the contraordinates of a given point are the following functions of the coordi-

nates :—
