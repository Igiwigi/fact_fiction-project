consumption equivalent terms when going from no signal to a full good signal is approximately
$500bn. The value of early information increases substantially if we can directly protect ourselves
against severe outcomes.

(c) Heterogeneous outcomes

We now incorporate the possibility that not everyone will be equally affected by a severe outcome.
If the state of the world is moderate, then the total endowment over the period t â‚¬ [f; + 1,300]
is Ez/tz=h with certainty. However, if climate change is severe then, with 5% probability,
E2/t2 =0.71. This reflects the fact that some members of the population are likely to be much more
severely affected by extreme climate change than others and we are currently unable to determine
whether or not we are in the high-risk group. Alternatively, we might posit that individuals are
saving or self-insuring for the next generation, and care about all its members equally. For the 95%
of the population who are not affected, E2/tz = 1.0158/. This keeps the economy-wide average
income level in the severe state the same as in the homogeneous agent example. /* takes the same
form as before for both the 95% and 5% groups. Thus, a 5% endowment spend over the next
t; =50 years will halve the difference in income between the moderate and severe states when
compared with the no insurance case.

Both in the presence and absence of a protective project, the broad shapes of expected
consumption, welfare and savings follow the patterns described in figures 5-7. When physical
adaptation is not possible, t= 1 expected consumption increases as the signal gets stronger and
