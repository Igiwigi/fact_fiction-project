This proves conclusively the existence of a direct
strand of fibres between the accessory auditory ganglion and the opposite
internal geniculate body. Hence we are unable to confirm the statement of
Epincer (14) that this segment of the auditory path is interrupted, first, in the
superior olivary body and, secondly, in the nucleus of the lateral fillet. From the
fact that the auditory tract diminishes in extent as it is traced upwards, it may be
argued that many of its fibres terminate in the superior olivary bodies, the nucleus
of the lateral fillet, and the posterior quadrigeminal tubercles, but that a considerable
number pass to the internal geniculate body uninterrupted (vide Schema 2). No
degeneration was observed in the so-called peduncle of the superior olive, which
passes from this body to the nucleus of the sixth cranial nerve, a fact which indicates
that there is no direct connexion between the auditory nerve and the centre for
conjugate movement of the globes. (d) Degenerations following Unilateral Destruction of the Posterior Quadrigeminal
Body and Lateral Fillet.
