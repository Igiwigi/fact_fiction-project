57 and 59,

Litt and JuHN summarily dismiss the theory that the rhachis is formed by
fusion of barbs, saying “ This is however, incorrect. . . . The two dorsalmost barbs
are laid down and become pigmented and keratinized while still separate from one
another. After that there can be no fusion except at their undifferentiated bases ;
it is at their bases, as a matter of fact, that the shaft proper begins by a fusion of the
two half-rings of the collar to which the bases of the first barbs, as well as those of all
succeeding barbs have a primary attachment.” (Pp. 142-143.) If successive cross-sections of a feather are taken from tip to base, it will be seen that
the two most apical barbs fuse to form the rhachis before cornification commences,
and since the feather is growing only at the base, this fusion is really a combination
of their growing basal regions.
