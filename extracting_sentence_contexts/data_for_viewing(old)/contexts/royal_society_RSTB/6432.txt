travel, as to be the same size or even smaller.‚Äù

Now in certain feathers of the fowl, e.g., remiges, all these conditions are present.
The barbs of one side are shorter than on the other ; the rhachis tends to be curved
away from the shorter side, fig. 54, Plate 28, and also the ventral point is deflected
towards the side of the rhachis bearing the shorter barbs, fig. 53, Plate 28.

The curvature of the feather, and also of the rhachis is possibly due to the habit
of the bird in holding the wings pressed against the sides of the body. As the follicles
are very close together in this position, constant pressure on the developing germ
would perhaps cause the feather to assume the curved shape. This, however, does
not explain the curvature in other feathers, e.g., the sickle feathers of the male,
although in such cases the follicles are invariably crowded. The two facts of (a) the
barbs on one side of the vane being shorter than on the other side, and (d) the
deflexion of the ventral point are self-explanatory without considering growth-rate.

Litu and Junn emphasize the point that they consider narrowness of the vane to
be correlated with rates of growth, but if of two barbs arising simultaneously on
either side of the ventral point, one is at a shorter distance from the rhachis than its
neighbour, then the vane on that side will be narrower. From the figures given, it
is obvious that the right-hand side of the vane in fig. 53, Plate 28, will be much
narrower than on the opposite side, while in fig. 52, Plate 28, the vane on the right-
hand side will be slightly wider than on the opposite side.

It sometimes happens that the barbs of a feather are not of uniform length along
