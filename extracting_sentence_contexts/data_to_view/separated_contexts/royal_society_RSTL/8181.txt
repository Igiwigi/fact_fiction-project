the ordinary longitudinal magnetism if the wire was at right angles to the terrestrial
magnetic meridian. As the torsions in these experiments with an iron wire depended upon the influence
of both coil and axial currents, it is eyident that the magnitude of them was limited by
the weakest ; and as the residual longitudinal magnetisxm was feeble and the axial
current strong, the magnitudes of the torsions yaried with the amount of that residual
magnetigm. As$uming that the magnitude of the first torsion was to some extent in
each case a measure of the residuary magnetism, and no interfering circumstances had
occurred, the magnetism left in the wire by the coil-current which produced a north
pole below was to that left by the same strength of current after producing a South
pole as 4-0 to 6:5; and this agrees with the fact that terrestrial magnetic influence
weakens the magnetism of a vertical soft-iron wire, the north pole of which is below. Further investigation might perhaps disclose the exact conditions under which differ-
ence of magnitude of the torsions constitutes a true measure of residual magnetism. Similar series of experiments were made with a steel wire 2:6 m. long and 2:16 mm.
