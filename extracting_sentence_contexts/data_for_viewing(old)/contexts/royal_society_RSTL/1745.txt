where he swings the cylinder (closed) first in air and afterwards in water :
which result gives 2 = 1'754, In the second set of experiments, he takes
away the bottom piece of the cylinder, and having swung it first in air (where
the diminished specific gravity was nearly the same as before), then immerses
it in water, whereby, he says © the specific gravity of the brass, about 8:3,
«js restored.” With this assumed specific gravity, the value given by M.
BxssEL is certainly correct. But if we suppose that the specific gravity of the
moving mass is not restored to the specific gravity of the metal by suffering
the tube to be filled with water; and that the pendulum can be considered in
no other light than as consisting of a cylinder filled with water, instead of a
cylinder filled with air; (the specific gravity of which, instead of being 8:3, will
probably not be 80 much as 2:8 ;) the yalue of the result will be materially
altered. In fact, if the specific gravity were only 25, the value of 2 would be
only 1-85 : which differs yery little from the value deduced by M. BxsstL from
the experiments with the c/osed cylinder. Now, I find (from the data furnished
by M. BxsseL,) that the specific gravity of the cylinder when filled with water
and with the bottom piece annexed, is about 2:8 : but it is evident that, when
the bottom piece is taken away, the specific gravity will not be 80 much ; and
by the assumption of such diminished specific gravity, the discordancy noticed
by M. Bxssz, would be considerably reduced, if not wholly eliminated #.
