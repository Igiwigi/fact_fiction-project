Submission and execution management of large ensembles of simulation jobs. Many scientific
applications need to run large ensemble simulations (1000+ runs) to perform UQ and SA, which
cannot be executed as individual jobs on most supercomputers due to scheduler constraints, and
require a pilot job mechanism such as QCG-PJ. QCG-PJ has been shown to efficiently execute
10000 jobs with less than 10% overhead, even if those jobs only last for one second each.!®

To improve the FabSim3 ensemble submission performance, we integrated it with QCG-PJ
and enabled multi-threaded job submission from the local machine. To demonstrate the benefit
of this, we measured the total elapsed time of the job submission to a remote machine for the
epidemiology” application. Owing to limitation of maximum number of submitted job per user!®

submission requests will be denied until existing jobs in this association complete.
