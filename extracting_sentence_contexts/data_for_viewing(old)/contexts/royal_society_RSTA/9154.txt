The results obtained by certain experimenters on the ordinary production of
primary X-radiation suggest, too, that mere collision of electrons with an anti-cathode
is not sufficiently sudden, or of sufficiently violent a nature, to result in the pro-
duction of the X-rays as ordinarily detected. The probability is rather that the
function of the cathode particle is to displace electrons from their normal positions
in atoms of the anti-cathode, and thus to produce in these atoms vibrations—some
characteristic, others not—which result in the emission of the primary radiation.

* There is no need to indicate the problems of absorption and radiation still awaiting solution.
Though there is no evidence as to the nature of the mechanism involved in these processes beyond what
is indicated by a change from certain initial to certain final conditions these investigations seem to
establish many important facts, and to show the narrow limits within which the quantum theory is in any
sense applicable.
