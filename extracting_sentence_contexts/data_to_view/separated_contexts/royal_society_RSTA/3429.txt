Clearly the indices cease to be of much use when they are such

high numbers, and the position of the faces can be equally well and conveniently
represented by their angles. In a paper on the vicinal faces of celestite (‘Zeits. f. Kryst.,’ XT., 1886, p. 220),
Hintze suggested that their relations are better expressed by the angles that they
make with each other than by the indices to which they can be referred ; and, in fact,
that they do not necessarily possess rational indices. Whether this be so or not, it will be safer for the present purpose to define the
vicinal faces of the growing alum crystal by their actual angles than by their possible
indices. One reason why I am led to believe that they are really referable to rational,
although not to simple, indices is the following :—During the growth of the crystal,
one set of vicinal faces is being continually replaced by another along certain zones ;
each image of the collimator signal fades away like a dissolving view and another
makes its appearance ; but the change is not gradual, neither are the surfaces curved ;
one plane reflecting-surface is replaced by another plane; and although the images
may for a time be multiple and confused, sharply defined images emerge successively

by the substitution of one image for another per saltwm.
