This technique has been used to examine dislocation densities in large grains
from the Vostok (Antarctica) ice core (figure 25) [113]. X-ray diffraction is a useful averaging
technique and can be used to study higher dislocation densities than observable using X-ray
topography. As noted earlier, EBSPs can also be used to observe lattice distortion and rotations
and subgrain boundaries in ice and also provides spatial information in under to understand the
local dislocation activity, although the technique suffers from the fact that the information is only
from the near-surface region (less than 1 pm) [79]. Neutron diffraction of HzO ice is not possible due to the very high incoherent scattering;
however, it can be performed on D20O ice, which behaves similarly to H2O ice. McDaniel et al. [114]
performed the first in situ deformation neutron diffraction experiments on polycrystalline D2O ice
using a specially built deformation apparatus that could apply a constant load while the specimen
was kept cold.
