immunostaining for H3K27me3 shows two Barr bodies at different locations at the periphery of the nucleus. (b) Example of a nucleus stained with DAPI (blue) after
immunostaining for nucleophosmin (red) and RNA-FISH for Xist to mark the Xi (green). Note that Xist RNA surrounds the nucleolus. (c,d) Hypothetical models of
