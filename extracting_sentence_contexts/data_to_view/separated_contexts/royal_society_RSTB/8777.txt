Figure 1. Factual reactive inferences in the rodent prefrontal cortex. (a) Inferential system arbitrating between actor learning and creation from long-term memory. Q, selective and P, predictive models forming behavioural strategies stored in the long-term memory repertoire (superscript f). Subscript t (trial number) indicates
actor strategy driving ongoing behaviour and learning external contingencies through reinforcement learning (RL) and action outcome frequencies.
