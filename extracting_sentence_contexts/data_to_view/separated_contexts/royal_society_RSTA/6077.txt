For the simple one-scalar model with exponential potential discussed earlier, there is only one
phase of transient acceleration if a = 3IV'I/ V > 1. This is likely to remain true for arbitrary one-
scalar positive potentials (unless 31V'| /V <1 for some values of o) because this is needed for
late-time acceleration. In any case, there is no known one-scalar example found by cosmological
compactification (and this fact is likely related to the de Sitter swampland conjecture that requires
|V'\/V > C for some (unknown) constant of order 1 [39]). However, for a simple dilaton-axion
model with

1
E= 56? +e ¥7) 4 Ae, (3.6)

there can be multiple phases of accelerating expansion when a > 1 (and even a > 1) if the dilaton-
axion coupling constant f is sufficiently large; this is the phenomenon of ‘recurrent acceleration’
[51]. A large dilaton-axion coupling will rapidly convert dilaton kinetic energy into axion kinetic
energy, which slows the descent down the exponential potential; the energy density is now
decreasing more slowly, sufficiently to drive an accelerated expansion.
