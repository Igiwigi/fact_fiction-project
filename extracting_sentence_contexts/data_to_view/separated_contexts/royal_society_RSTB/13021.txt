Another factor may be the belief
that valence has important innate aspects, even in humans,
which may be difficult to disambiguate in other species. Adolphs & Anderson observe:

Box 1. Emotion properties [1, p. 66]*

(1) Valence, hedonic quality;

(2) Scalability, a version of arousal referring to grada-
tions in intensity;

(3) Persistence of the affective state after initial detection
of a stimulus;

(4) Generalization, the ability to confer value in a new
context owing to memory and learning;

(5) Global coordination, the tendency of emotion states to
induce widespread changes in the whole organism;

(6) Automaticity, the fact that emotion states exist some-
where between reflexes and deliberate actions, and their
potency typically trumps deliberate acts; and

(7) Social communication, the fact that emotion states, or
elements of their expression (e.g. facial and/or other
bodily movements), seem to be ‘pre-adapted to serve
as social communicative signals’.

*The content of this box is adapted entirely from this
source. Without some such innate basis, there would be nothing to
ground valence, nothing upon which learned associations
could build. Those innate representations of valence, in turn,
would not have been selected in evolution if they did not
afford the species a survival advantage.

What Adolphs & Anderson mean by ‘innate’ in this context is
not entirely clear—the ‘hard-wired’/acquired distinction
seems likely—but it should be noted (with the greatest respect)
that the innateness concept is problematic.
