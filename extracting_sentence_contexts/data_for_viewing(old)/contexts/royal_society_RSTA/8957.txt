comes within. It may be noted that 17A’,+1$d=16A’,+A,. These three data do not
decisively distinguish between the two cases. This, however, is not to be unexpected
because the two arise from a 4, displacement in d,;, the sequents in this neighbourhood
are such that 3, on the limit and 2d, on the sequent are nearly equivalent, arid the
multiples involved 185, 189, 195 are too close to produce contrasts. Incidentally, also,
the discussion strengthens the allocation of the lines to the displacements given.

The only further test with our present knowledge is to obtain some independent
evidence as to the exact value of the limit, and naturally we turn for this to the mean
of the F and F series. The series however in Kr is not nearly so well developed as in
X. As has been already seen there are only three sets of observed pairs (m = 2, 3, 4)
and these give for F (0) respectively values of 30674°77, ...7'27, ...7°16. Since a
displacement of }, produces a*change of 2°03 in F() the first may be due to the fact
that the line taken for F (2) is really (3d,) F(2), when the true mean would be
30677°81. It is natural to seek further as to the existence of summation lines
corresponding to our last three examples. The result shows a most remarkable
agreement. The sets are shown in the following list together with those obtained
from the normal F and F.
