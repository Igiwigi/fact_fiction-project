One of the subjects of the research was to study the oscillations of pressure which
are set up under certain conditions. In a long cylinder such oscillations are easily
started, but in a small sphere the symmetrical shape and the short distance from wall
to wall tend to equalise the pressure existing at each instant throughout the
enclosure. Thus, in a spherical enclosure, the pressure rises usually without vibration
and forms a smooth curve, the shape of which depends exclusively on the nature of
the explosive used. In a long cylinder, however, the normal curve is modified by the
distribution of the explosive, the method of firing, and various other factors.

Before designing these chambers, the relative advantages of solid metal and wire
winding were fully considered. The latter construction, if properly carried out, adds
considerably to the ultimate strength. A system of winding suitable for a spherical
enclosure is, however, not easy to devise, and this fact, together with the ever
important consideration of cost, led to the adoption of solid walls.

Mild steel was chosen as the material best suited to withstand the sudden impact
of an explosion. â€˜The limit of elasticity, ultimate strength, and elongation of test
pieces cut perpendicular to the direction of rolling were carefully determined before
the forgings were machined.
