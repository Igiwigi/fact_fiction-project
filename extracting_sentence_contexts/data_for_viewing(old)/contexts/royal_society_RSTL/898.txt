sity which it has been remarked exists at Portsoy, the com-

be considered as not far distant from the truth, both being
Situated on rocks of a similar nature; Unst consisting chiefly
of serpentine, and Portsoy, of serpentine, slate, and granite ;
and as 4; the ellipticity given by the experiments at Unst
and Arbury Hill, is nearly the same as that resulting from
Unst and Portsoy, it would be no improbable conjecture that
the sudden' increase of gravitation observed at Arbury Hill,
may be occasioned by a rock of primitive formation, approach-
ing the surface of the earth in the vicinity of that station.*

These facts appear sufficient to explain the anomalies which

Â®* Since the above was written, I find the conjecture I have hazarded remarkably
supported by fact; for on consulting Su1TH's Geological Map of England, it appears
that Mount Sorrel, a mass of granite, is situated, together with other rocks of primitive
formation, about 3o miles to the north of Arbury Hill,
