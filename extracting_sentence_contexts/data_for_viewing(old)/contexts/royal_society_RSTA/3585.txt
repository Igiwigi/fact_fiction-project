we have a proposition that it’s not really the concentration of hydrogen
that causes embrittlement, but rather its mobility, its flux through the
material.

It’s an interesting idea that questions the notion that all the aspects
can be determined by thermodynamic equilibrium. It is a feature that
develops. It is easy to understand each process of the interaction of
hydrogen with various defects, but I am not sure that these processes
are the only cause of hydrogen embrittlement. That's my first question.

The second question is regarding the fact that hydrogen promotes
the formation and emission of different defects, particularly vacancies,
which is now well known. The question is how you can distinguish
between a situation where hydrogen embrittlement is linked only to
the hydrogen, and a situation where the production of defects gives
the embrittlement. How can we construct an experimental or simulation
approach to differentiate these situations?

The last question is linked to the interaction of hydrogen and defects,
specifically dislocations. There is a well-known shielding process, where
we suppose that hydrogen promotes the emission and shielding of the
dislocation’s elastic field. This then induces a softening process and
causes planar slip. But if you perform different analyses for large strains
