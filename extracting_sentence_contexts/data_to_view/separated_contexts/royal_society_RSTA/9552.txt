The numerical evidence afforded from a
study of the low melting-point elements of the first three groups of the Periodic
Table is remarkably exact. The numerous lines of all these series are represented
within limits of error, and as a rule with extreme closeness, by the formula adopted. The argument is based on the denominator of p(1), and this is determinable with
great exactness; in fact, any possible error in this due either to error of observations
or error in the limit chosen for the series will exert practically no influence on the
result.* A change in N might do so to some extent. Any uncertainty is due to
uncertainty in the values used for the atomic volume, which might amount to as
much as 1 per cent., Â¢.g., changing 2740 by 30. The high melting-point elements of
Group IT. do not show the law with such certainty, but there are clear indications of it.
