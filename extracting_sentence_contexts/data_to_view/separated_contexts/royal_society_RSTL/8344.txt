The bases of
six linear leaves (1.94) are seen radiating from the lower and left-hand sides of the section
with considerable regularity. The breadth of each leaf is about 021. I discoyer no
trace of vascular tissues, either in the leaves themselves or amongst the cellular tissnes
of the foliar disk from which they arise; and it is a further curious fact that no
vacant spaces exist, either in the outer (4) or middle (4) bark, 8uch as are common
amongst the Lepidodendra, where they were originally occupied by vessels that have
disappeared. The transverse section of the central vascular axis, at this important
point of the stem, exhibits its usual appearance ; and it is obvious that, if any of the
very large vessels composing it had eyer been deflected into the leaves, their large size
must have made them conspicuous objects, whilst their divergence must haye left 8ome
considerable gap in the regularly concentric and radial lines of vessels; but no traces
of such conditions have been discovered. The leaves appear as if they consisted wholly
of cells, which, as we have already seen from Plate I. fig. 5, are mainly, if not entirely,
derived from the outer bark *, Unfortunately these foliar tissues are much disorganized
and rendered indistinct through carbonization, consequently the exact arrangement of
their component elements has yet to be made out; at the same time I have clear
evidence that the central part of the leaf, at least, was chiefly composed of long, narrow,
parallel-sided cells, and thattheremainder was occupied bya somewhat coarse parenchyma.
