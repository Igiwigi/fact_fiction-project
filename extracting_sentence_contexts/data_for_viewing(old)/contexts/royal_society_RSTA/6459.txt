intended to deprive the labels of any physical meaning, we could prefer an intrinsic formalism
that avoids using such ‘surplus structure’ right from the start (like the Fock space formalism in
quantum field theory or the reduced phase space description in gauge theories). However—as
we shall see in the next section—the thesis that fundamental physical symmetries like exchange
symmetries or gauge symmetries are nothing but a mere formal device by means of which we can
get rid of a previously introduced representational redundancy is not devoid of problems.

4. Indistinguishability in gauge theories

The notion of symmetry is intimately related to the notion of indistinguishability. Briefly, a
symmetry transformation is a non-trivial operation acting on a given configuration such that
the initial and the final states are indistinguishable. It is a well-known fact that symmetries play
an essential role in physics [104,105]. A fundamental step in the understanding of the physical
importance of the notion of symmetry was the discovery by Emmy Noether of the relation
between (global) symmetries (defined by a finite dimensional Lie group) of the corresponding
Lagrangian and conserved quantities (i.e. quantities that do not change under the temporal
evolution of the system). Noether’s second theorem encodes a generalization of this result to
local symmetries, that is, to symmetries defined by an infinite-dimensional Lie group [106-108].
In this case, the existence of local symmetries leads to the existence of relations between the
canonical variables of the Hamiltonian formulation called constraints [109-111]. The importance
