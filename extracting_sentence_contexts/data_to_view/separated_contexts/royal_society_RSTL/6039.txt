162. Imagine an involution of points; take on the line which is the locus in quo of
the point-system a point O, and consider the point-system formed by the harmonics of
O in respect to the several pairs of the involution ; and in like manner take on the line
any other point O', and consider the point-system formed by the harmonics of O' in
respect to the several pairs of the involution ; these two point-systems are homogra-
phically related to each other.—See Fifth Memoir, No. 111.

163. Two involutions may be homographically related to each other ; in fact, take on
the line which is the locus i quo of the first involution a point O, and consider the point-
system formed by the harmonics of O in relation to the several pairs of the involution ;
take in like manner on the line which is the locus in quo of the second involution a point
Q, and consider the point-system formed by the harmonics of Q with respect to the
several pairs of the involution; then if the two point-systems are homographically
related, the two involations are said to be themselves homographically related : the last
preceding article shows that the nature of the relation does not in anywise depend on
the choice of the points O and Q. And it is not necessary that, as regards the two
involutions respectively, the words line and point should have the same significations. —
