Now, since there was no gas
flowing through the connecting pipe when the observations which determined the
constants A and B were made, the conduction effect must have been very different
from what it was when gas was flowing through the pipe. To fix our ideas, suppose the temperature gradient in a connecting pipe is uniform
when no gas is flowing through it. Now, when the hot gas passes through the tube,
it will keep the temperature of the latter up, so that the temperature gradient in the
tube near the heater will be very much reduced ; in fact, it is possible that it may be
reduced practically to zero, so that no heat will be conducted from the heater to a
point in the pipe a little distance from it. Heat will certainly be conducted to the
calorimeter through the pipe, but this heat will come from the gas itself and not
