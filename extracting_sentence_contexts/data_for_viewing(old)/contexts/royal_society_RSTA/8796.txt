passing through the channel owing to a difference between the depths on the two
sides.

In the case of the South Channel the depths are practically equal on the two sides,
so the fronts of the waves will not turn, though of course they may be very slightly
convex, owing to the greater depth in mid-channel.

The direction of the line AB from South Arklow to Bardsey is N. 86° W. The
direction of the line TS from Tuskar to Ramsey is 8. 574° W. The angle turned
through by the co-tidal line from 6h. 15m. to 8h. 10m. is therefore N. 86° W. minus
8. 57° W. = 364°.

As a matter of fact the angle turned through by the co-tidal line is, if anything,
rather greater than this, because the true co-tidal line for 8h. 10m. must be a little
north of Bardsey and south of South Arklow, while the true co-tidal line for 6h. 15m.
must run from a point slightly north of Tuskar Rock to a point slightly south of
Ramsey Island. The true angle between the co-tidal lines for 6h. 15m. and 8h. 10m.
is therefore slightly greater than 363°.

Now let us turn to the explanation. It has been pointed out already (see p. 9)
that the “ geostrophic” or deflecting force due to the earth’s rotation increases the
rise and fall of tide on the side of the channel which lies on the right-hand side of an
observer who faces in the direction in which the tidal stream is running at H.W. In
the case of a progressive tidal wave the current at high water is moving in ‘the
direction in which the wave is travelling.
