Surprise can happen when a person had no clear
conceptually and empirically, from the PPF. PPF offers impor- expectations (e.g. ‘I don’t know who the painter is’) and they
tant, empirically verified or verifiable insights about the role of updated their beliefs in any direction, or when their clear
internal models and expectations about stimulus processing as expectations were violated (e.g. ‘I thought it was Cezanne
well as expectations about fluency itself. Note, however, that but in fact the painter was Picasso’). It highlights the impor-
the standard PPF could be extended by including a broader tant role of prior expectations (e.g. expertise on the previous
consideration of goals [12]. This is because beyond building style of the artist, reputation of the gallery, reviews of the
accurate predictive models, people have other epistemic goals movie) in creating a sense of surprise.
