G. CANNON ON THE FEEDING MECHANISM OF THE BRANCHIOPODA. This would be a matter of detail were it not for the fact that Srorcu in his investigation
of other Branchiopoda assumes that all filtratory limbs move in the same way as those of
Daphnia. Now if Srorc with his elaborate cinematographic apparatus would
photograph a Daphnid on its back and focus, not on the edges of the third and fourth
trunk limbs, but on the floor of the food groove, I am convinced that he would always
obtain a clear image. This would be a critical experiment as a camera has no * after
image,‚Äù so that, if at any instant the third limbs came together in the middle line, this
would obscure the food groove and it would be recorded on the photograph.
