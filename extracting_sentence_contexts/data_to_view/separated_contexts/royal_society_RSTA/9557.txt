RbS (2) is also from the formula, as Ber@mMann’s observed value is very considerably
in error. The difference between corresponding numbers are entered between
them. Arranged in this way a number of facts emerge at once. Regarding Zn, Cd, Al,
and Tl, they all with one or two exceptions clearly indicate a general law that from
m = 2 onwards the denominators for the different triplets or doublets in each element
differ by the same amount, and that this amount is somewhere about ‘7 to “8 times
the corresponding difference for m= 1, which gives the values of A,, A,, or the
atomic weight terms. We may feel justified, therefore, in using this as a test to
apply to Pascuen’s allocation of the upper lines of the P series for Hg.
