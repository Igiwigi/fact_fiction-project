it can be mitigated in a dialectically convincing way via inductive triangulation based on a
vast array of successful scientific practices. Reliable inferences concerning conclusions about
inaccessible target systems are commonplace in science and thus there are abundant resources
available to mitigate the concerns of a (reasonable) sceptic regarding accessible to inaccessible
inductive inferences in general. Finally, it is worth noting that black holes are accessible when
seen as classical systems since empirical access to classical black hole phenomenology can be
gained via the relevant gravitational interactions. For example, between the 1970s and early
2000s, astrophysical observations lead to the near unequivocal demonstration that the centre of
the Milky Way holds a supermassive black hole based on the motions of nearby orbiting stars


[110-112].!5 Furthermore, many of the key classical features of black holes, such as event horizons,
are implied by general relativity, which is extraordinarily well confirmed. So, in fact, the inference
that we are considering is from an accessible and manipulable system to an unmanipulable and
partially inaccessible system. Structurally this is a similar form of inference to that found in our
stellar nucleosynthesis case.

This latter point is telling for the more speculative claim for which we argue in this work;
namely, that we take inductive triangulation to allow for the possibility of analogue experiments
to play a role, when combined with appropriate conventional experimental results, in establishing
new theories. In the stellar nucleosynthesis case above, we saw explicitly how a theoretical
framework characterizing a set of unmanipulable and partially inaccessible phenomena could
come to be regarded as established by the scientific community on account of a series of
independent lines of evidence employing independent inductive inferences (that is, by inductive
triangulation). We characterized the model of stellar nucleosynthesis as merely well supported
