JEANS ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF MOLECULAR ENERGY. We shall assume that these co-ordinates are principal co-ordinates of the system, so
that-both the kinetic and potential energies will be the sums of squares. We may,
in fact, write

WV = 67, + ore +... oF ore
2T = me? + 2Q + 28S

where

2Q = big? + bog +... + DiQn?
28 ="d.5,* ---da,’ FE ae. We shall suppose the oscillations of the 7, s co-ordinates to be so small as to be
isochronous, and in this case the ¢ and d coefficients will be constants. Since the r
co-ordinates are to be very small, the “ configuration ” of a molecule may be supposed
to be determined by its p co-ordinates.
