But this much it was possible to see with certainty, Ist, that the altered conductivity
was similar to both directions of testing current, and 2nd, that it subsided with
subsidence of blaze. SF The principal difficulty that stands in the way of exact measurements of resistance
& arises from the fact that the testing current itself excites retinal discharge in a given
8 (“ positive ”) direction. The phenomenon of apparent “ irreciprocal resistance,” due
& to organ discharge in one direction only, is thus presented by the eyeball precisely
By as by an electrical organ.* Deflection caused by a homonymous induction shock
aD sent through eyeball and galvanometer in series is greater than deflection caused
g by a similar but heterodrome shock.
