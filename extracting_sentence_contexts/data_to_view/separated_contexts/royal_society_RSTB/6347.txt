Neighbouring pedicellariae bend towards the cause of the disturbance and, after
touching it, seize it by closure of the jaws. The impulse to open the valves can,
apparently, be transferred to neighbouring pedicellariae, while the impulse required
to close them and to keep them closed is not so conducted. In this latter case, in
fact, in order for closure to occur, each valve must be separately stimulated. There
is then, in the “ opening ”’ reaction and its transference to neighbouring pedicellariae,
evidence of nervous connexions outside the body of the pedicellaria, while in the
“closing”? reaction, which is not transmitted from one pedicellaria to another,
there is evidence of an independent sensory-motor system within the body of the
organ. JENNINGS (1907) found, moreover, that in the absence of inhibitory impulses
stimulation of the inside of the valve caused closure, while stimulation of the outer
surface caused opening of the valves.
