For the vanishing chevelure of a star being equally
connected, on the one hand, with the generally diffused nebu-
lous matter, and on the other with the star itself, round which
it is in a state of gradual condensation. ; this double union de-
notes the mutual gravitation of the whole mass of nebulosity
and the star towards each other; and unless this. proof, can be .
invalidated, we must admit the fact of the growing condition
of stars, that are in the situation which has been pointed out. This argument also adds greatly to the probability of stars
