approach to the design of a new cathode for the solid oxide fuel cells. Interesting results were
achieved in both of these studies. But, so far as the first part of his work is concerned, Rosseinsky
himself admitted that the combinatorial approach can never thoroughly explore all the possible
promising catalysts for a given conversion. As CNR Rao pointed out in the Discussion, in relation
to both the first and second parts of Rosseinsky’s paper, it is chemical know-how and chemical
intuition—not trial and error—that has, in the past, led to over 90% of the major advances in solid-
state chemistry. A point made by a member of the audience devolved upon the issue of whether
predicting the ‘right’ structure for a new catalyst necessarily implied that that structure would be
the most catalytically effective. It is clear that Rosseinsky’s methodology has much to commend
it.

The topic of Karen Wilson’s stimulating presentation [15] was ‘catalysts for the production of
energy from renewable sources’. Among the many interesting facts in her work was the use of
steam-explosion treatment of biomass, which gives rise to a useful new source (both from the
resulting hydrolysate and the condensate).

This novel technique is used by scientists in the food-oriented industry. By judicious use of
solid acid catalysts, which have long been known [16] to serve as effective means of transforming
a wide variety of widely available reactants to useful products. Carefully prepared porous solids
of precisely defined architecture (as discussed fully elsewhere [17]), on to the inner surfaces
of which Bronsted-acid catalytic centres can be grafted, can yield an extensive range of useful
catalysts. Prof. Wilson illustrated her work by reference to 5-hydroxymethylfurfural which, in
