correspond to a first measurement of properties of the microscopic action with a sufficiently deep
consistency bound. With respect to cosmology, also the thermal evolution of the Higgs potential is
of substantial interest. In this respect, higher-dimensional operators can also exert an influence on
the nature of the thermal phase transition, as has already been observed in lattice simulations [53].
It is an interesting question as to whether the set of bare actions contains relevant microscopic
initial conditions for which the electroweak phase transition is sufficiently strongly first order
in order to support electroweak baryogenesis.

A particularly fascinating scenario would arise if the Higgs boson mass happened to lie close
to the value that corresponds to an exactly flat interaction potential. Then the UV theory has
to guarantee such an exceptional matching condition at the high scale. In fact, asymptotically
safe gravity had been suggested for such a scenario already before the discovery of the Higgs
boson [54]; see also [55]. Purely within particle field theory, such a scenario would be most natural
in theories where also the Higgs sector becomes asymptotically freeâ€”a long-standing idea that
currently witnesses new attraction [56-60].
