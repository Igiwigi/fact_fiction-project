Plate 8, fig. 28, represents a transverse section of a Rachiopteris, of which I have
several sections. At the first glance its central vascular bundle, cut through
transyersely, has a Zygopteroid aspect, but it differs in the fact that, whilst its side
a consists of a line of large vessels, its opposite side b is composed of very small
ones: at the two points ¢, c’ the bundle consists of a number of the small vessels
resembling those at b, but here forming an irregular mass surrounding a vacant space
at each end of the central portion, a, b ; at d a cluster of these small vessels is detached
in Zygopteroid fashion, as if going to supply some peripheral organ. The outer
cortex is composed of an uniform cellular tissue. I propose the name of Rachiopteris
irreqularis for this very distinct organism, which is from Halifax.
