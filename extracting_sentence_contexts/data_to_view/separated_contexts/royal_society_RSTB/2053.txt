There is similar divergence of opinion as to the mechanism
of the nocturnal closure, and an almost complete absence of evidence as to the
biological meaning of the phenomenon, Again, hardly anything is known as to the
diurnal course of the stomatal movements or as to its inherent periodicity. On some
of these points I hope to throw light. The fact that stomata are widely open in bright sunshine is well known. The
following notes illustrate the difference between bright and less bright diffused light.
