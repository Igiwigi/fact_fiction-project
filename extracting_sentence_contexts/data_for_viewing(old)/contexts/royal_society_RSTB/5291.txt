of the vertebral column and skull, were not themselves surrounded by networks of minor
branches and were not distributed, except in the gills, to the walls of their associated
arteries.

This difference in the richness of the system in the deeper connective tissues may be
due to the different character of these tissues in the two species. In Lophius they are
extremely abundant and of very loose texture ; in the Cod less in quantity, closer and
tougher. That this difference in texture may exert some controlling influence is suggested
also by the fact that in the Cod, in areas occupied by masses of soft gelatinous connective
tissue (such as those met with in the snout and upon the top of the head), the branching
of the “ fine ” vessels is far more rich and elaborate than where the connective tissues
are more dense and fibrous.

By comparing the above account of the distribution of the main trunks of the “ fine ”’
system in the Cod with that already published for Lophius (4, p. 29), it will be apparent
that the two agree in their broader outlines, though differing in minor details. There
is, however, one very considerable difference : in Lophius the system is limited to the
head and forepart of the body, but in the Cod it extends along the aorta to the
caudal fin.

It is possible that this difference in distribution is apparent only and is due to dis-
