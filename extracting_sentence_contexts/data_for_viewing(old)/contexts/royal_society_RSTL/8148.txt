Sthe intermediate cellular tissue seen in Plate XLIIL. fig. 22 was gradually absorbed to
Smake room for them. In the secondary medullary rays this absorption was carried 80
afar, in consequence of the pressure occasioned by the steady growth of the vessels, that
<=nearly all the cells disappeared ; whereas in the primary rays, where a vascular foliar
Ebundle interposed between two adjacent enlarging vessels, the bundle resisted their
—Pressure, protecting the cells immediately above and below it from its effects. Hence
Sa lenticular space was left permanently occupied by unabsorbed cells; but at the upper
Land lower angles of this space it contracts to the dimensions of the true secondary
Zmedullary rays. If this explanation is correct, it establishes my conclusion that these
Rlarge paces, seen in Plate XLII. figs. 12 & 13, mm, are but modified medullary rays, and
that they are 80 modified, not for the purpose of transmitting the vascular foliar bundles,
but as an effect of their presence, which is a very different thing.
In my last memoir I called attention to the fact that the foliar bundles originated
from the line of junction between the vascular medullary cylinder and the ligneous zone®.

* T haye to correct an error into which I fell on this point in the text of my previous memoir. TI had clearly
ascertained that the foliar bundles sprang from small vessels occupying the plane where the outer surface of the
vrascular medullary cylinder and the inner one of the ligneous zone were in contact, and I came to the con-
clusion that they belonged to the latter rather than to the former ; but T now see that this was a mistake. I
