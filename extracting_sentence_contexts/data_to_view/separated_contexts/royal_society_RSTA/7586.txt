Following the routine of thought
established under the influence of the Bayes Theorem, we could ask that, given the

P{9 (E’) < 0,° < 6 (E’)|E} =«,

we see at once that it contradicts the assumption that 6,° is constant. In fact, on
this assumption, whatever the fixed point E’ and the values 0 (E’) and 0 (E’), the
only values the probability (19) may possess are zero and unity. For this reason we
shall drop the specification of the problem as given by the condition (19). Returning to the inequalities (18), we notice that while the central part, 0,°, is a
constant, the extreme parts 0 (E’) and 6 (E’) are particular values of random
variables.
