The resulting effective permittivity distribution is shown in figure 6a. The background permittivity when extracting the material tensors is appropriately selected to
provide a desired range of graphene conductivity values. From the effective permittivity (or
impedance), the corresponding imaginary conductivity values can be calculated, as shown in
figure 6b, using the fact that ngpp = â‚¬eq. The chemical potential is then computed assuming that
Ir =0.43 meV, T = 300K and f =30THz. Then, from the chemical potential, designers have the
choice of numerically solving for the required substrate permittivity, thickness or bias voltage
using equations (7.6) and (7.7) to achieve the desired GRIN profile.
