E32410 to 32545 were then randomized and the measurements repeated; in the case of

these specimens the mean of the two separate determinations was taken as the area for
the tables and computations.


MICRASTER CORANGUINUM AND M. (ISOMICRASTER) SENONENSIS 383

The last sets of characters to be measured concern the anterior ambulacrum in specimens
E32410 to 32545, inclusive.

(n) The number of plates in the petaloid portion of this ambulacrum. The counts were
made under a binocular microscope, and, in fact, pore-pairs were counted and not plates,
as it is often impossible to distinguish the boundaries of individual plates. The end of the
petal was taken as the point at which the pore-pairs showed no sign of petaloid
modifications.

(0) The length of the petal. This was measured with dividers as in (f). â€˜The measure-
ment was taken from the commencement of the ambulacrum at the apex, to the end of
the petal as determined in the course of the pore counts.

fasciole are indicated by dotted lines, and the area actually measured is stippled.
