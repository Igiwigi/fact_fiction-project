In calculating the isostatic anomalies allowance has been made for the attraction
both of the topography and of its compensation. We should therefore anticipate
that, if the region is in fact in isostatic equilibrium, these anomalies would be smaller

* Clearly the deficiency must underlie the topography, for otherwise the mountains would have
to be really hollow to provide the necessary deficiency.
