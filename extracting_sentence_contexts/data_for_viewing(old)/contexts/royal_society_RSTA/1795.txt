The direct intervention of the British Government by way of legislation was limited throughout
this period. The Alkali Works Regulation Act 1863 and its Alkali Inspectorate were the prime
example of governmental responsiveness to environmental matters during this period: necessity,
driven by widespread and self-evident health and welfare problems, but enacted reluctantly.

Initially, it was the ‘common law’ that was used to combat instances of polluting activity in
England. The English ‘civil claims procedure’ requires a complainant, a defendant and proof ona
balance of probabilities that the ‘injury’ complained of was caused by the action or inaction of the
defendant by reason of breach of a standard of care—a standard established and refined by the
judiciary over many decades on a case-by-case basis. This was thereby inevitably a standard that
was intrinsically susceptible to circumstance and prevailing norms. This reliance on an ‘after-
the-fact’ procedure, coupled with a requirement to establish a clear, legally recognizable causal


link between alleged cause and supposed effect, was to permeate the UK’s approach to what we
now term environmental regulation. The approach was one of future prevention of what could
be shown to have already been clearly unacceptable rather than a ‘precautionary approach’, the
latter now underpinning much of current thinking in relation to matters of the environment and
social well-being generally.

A key step on the way to developing a UK legal framework for air pollution is the ‘The Law
of Nuisance’. As early as 1610, William Aldred’s case, as it is known, saw the courts intervene
against one Thomas Benton for building a pigsty ‘so near the house of the plaintiff that the
air therof was corrupted’. The court found that light and clean air were considered necessary
