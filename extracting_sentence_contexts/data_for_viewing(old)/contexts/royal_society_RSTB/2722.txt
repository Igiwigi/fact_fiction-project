Amphibia is behind the eye, and this is the connection of the gammation with the
cranial walls in our youngest specimen, but in larger specimens, though apparently
freed from this connection, the gammation has not entered into union with the
auditory capsules ; it may have done so, but there is no absolute proof that it did.
Still, our friend, Professor Brrpe@r, who has carefully studied our reconstructions,
remarks that “it looks as though such a connection must have existed” ;
in this we fully concur, and if we may assume that the appearance represents
the fact, we may identify, as we have done, the gammation with the hyo-
mandibular, the pre-gammation with the palato-quadrate, the posterior trapezial
with the hyoid, and the anterior trapezial bars with the mandible. The
lower jaw would, in this case, have been singularly diminutive ; it could have bitten
against the palato-quadrate, and its position would have been transverse. Its two
halves are now separated in the middle line, and it is unprovided with teeth. Teeth
might, however, have been originally present ; they would have been very minute,
and highly calcified. Under the conditions which were favourable to the conversion
of cartilage into coal, much carbonic acid would be evolved, in presence of which
calcareous structures, such as teeth, might easily pass into solution. The interpreta-
tion of the anterior arches which seems most probable is thus frankly Selachian, but
no known Elasmobranch is provided with jaws so insignificant in size, or with a
hyoid which, as in this case, greatly exceeds them in magnitude. Dr. Gooprica,
