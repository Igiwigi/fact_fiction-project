We may now go on to consider the light which these observations throw on the
probable evolutionary history of a species. Mutations being granted as the only
available method of origin, the species must have sprung directly from some other
species, and natural selection being reduced to very secondary importance, there is no
reason why this other species should be killed out.

As the numbers of endemic species increase from VC to VR, this would indicate
that they began at one or other end of this scale, and not somewhere in the middle.
Now it is highly improbable that they began at the VC end, for this would indicate
that they are now dying out, and it would seem a most remarkable thing if species
actually developed in Ceylon should not even have enough local adaptation to
be able to survive there. It is far more probable that they began at the VR end of
the scale, and this is a view strongly supported by the fact that there are amongst
them a great number of species confined to one mountain top or to some very small
area. No fewer than 108 species* are thus confined to one mountain top or to small
areas in the mountains. Many of these only occur, as, for instance, those on the top
of Ritigala,t as a very few individuals; they must have been evolved on the
mountain top where they are found, as I have shown elsewhere ; and they can never
have existed as many more individuals than at present.

Each species then, we may suppose, began as VR, 7.e., as one or a few individuals
in some very limited area. In the case of C. elongatus, which is confined to Ritigala
summit, the whole plant, so far as I could discover, is represented by a few
individuals (not more than a dozen or so), and as there are several other endemic
forms on this mountain top, whilst the area of ground suited to the Coleus is very
