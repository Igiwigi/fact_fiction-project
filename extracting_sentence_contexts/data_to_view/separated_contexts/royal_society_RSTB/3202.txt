Owing to the
ready permeability of the walls of the wood-vessels to. water, complete adhesion of
the menisci never takes place in living functioning wood-vessels containing water
and air-bubbles, and even in vessels filled with air a film of water -lines the
interior. The slow restoration of conductivity when water is forced into a dried
length of a stem is due to the fact that the water enters the closed vessels
laterally through the walls, forming a series of broken columns whose menisci at
first adhere firmly, but subsequently become more freely motile as the walls become
wetter and the air-bubbles smaller (cf. fig. 1, A, C, and D). ZIMMERMANN gives the maximal resistance of a JAMIN’s chain of air and water
in tubes of 0°2-0°02 centim, diameter as being one-quarter to one-sixth of the
capillary force for the same tube.
