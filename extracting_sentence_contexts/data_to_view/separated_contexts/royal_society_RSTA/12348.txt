In the first point of analogy it was stated the atomic weight of a gas
corresponded with its specific gravity, but with the reservation that the combining
proportions are simple multiples or quotients of the same. This appears to me to be
the fair statement of the remarkable connection that is always found between the
combining volume and combining weight. It seems impossible that the fact of a
volume of every gas containing the same number of molecules can ever be inductively

Ã© established, but all analogy leads us to this conclusion. One volume of oxygen
= combines with two volumes of hydrogen to form two volumes of aqueous vapour. If
5 we inferred from this that one molecule of oxygen combined with two molecules of
3 hydrogen to form one of steam, we must admit that the molecule of steam occupies
g double the volume of a molecule of hydrogen or oxygen.
