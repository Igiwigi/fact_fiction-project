being supplied from the walls of the containing vessel. Experiments described below
(p. 88), however, show that associated with the expansion there is a rise in tempe-
rature; and that for very short illuminations, where there is not time for equalization
of temperature between the gas and the vessel containing it, the rise in temperature
is proportional to the amount of hydrochloric acid formed; and in all cases the
expansion is fully accounted for by the rise in temperature observed. Under
favourable conditions the ratio of expansion to the subsequent contraction, measuring
the amount of hydrochloric acid formed, may be as much as 7 or 8, so that in
PRINGSHEIM’S experiments, where the expansions were 2 millims. on his scale, the
hydrochloric acid formed may have escaped detection. PrinasHerm{ further con-
cluded that the expansion due to a given quantity of light was independent of the
amount of hydrochloric acid formed—independent of the state of the induction, This
conclusion, however, is not borne out by more careful experiments—-in fact, a corre-
sponding phenomenon to the period of induction appears in the case of the initial
expansion (see below, p. 83).

AND CHLORINE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF LIGHT. 75

Tn 1897 Gavutrer and Hitrer* investigated the action of light on dry chlorine and
hydrogen. They noticed that the gas they prepared, by electrolysis of aqueous
hydrochloric acid, did not consist of a mixture of the pure gases, but that there was
