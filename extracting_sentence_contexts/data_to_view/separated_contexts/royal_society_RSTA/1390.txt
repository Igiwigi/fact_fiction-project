Electronic supplementary material, figure S2 shows the per cent
error in simulated average DJF maximum 3h precipitation accumulation using the non-native
grid observations and highlights the importance of the order of operations in constructing the
reference maxima. The native grid errors reveal that even the coarse models do not systematically
underestimate extreme precipitation, contradicting a commonly held view. In fact, three of the
models are generally too wet in the winter while the others are too dry in the wetter southeast
and Pacific coast regions. Non-native grid model errors are very different to native grid errors
since the non-native reference values, shown in the bottom row of figure 1, are so much larger
than the native reference values of the top row of figure 1. The patterns of non-native grid model
errors in the electronic supplementary material, figure S2 are much less similar across resolutions
than the native grid model errors in figure 3 and can even be of opposite sign as summarized in
the electronic supplementary material, table S1.
