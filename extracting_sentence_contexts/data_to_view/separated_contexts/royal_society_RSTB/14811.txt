Does diet-induced thermogenesis exist? diet initially leads to increased food intake, and the mice
become more obese, but they combust with time a larger fraction
of the food, probably in brown adipose tissue, since they have
more UCP1. That the system is effective is seen (figure 1d) in
that, given access to the same food, the mice without UCP1
become even more obese. That the system is only partly efficient
is seen from the fact that even the UCP1-containing wild-type
mice still become fatter when exposed to the high-fat diet than
when exposed to the chow diet (figure 1d). The possibility that brown adipose tissue (when active) keeps
us slim thus depends fully on the actual existence of brown-
fat-mediated diet-induced thermogenesis. A criterion for its
existence would be that it is thermogenesis induced by a
diet that inspires overeating.
