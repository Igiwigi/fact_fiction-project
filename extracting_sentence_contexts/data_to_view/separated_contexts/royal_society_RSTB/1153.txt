In fact, there is no direct evidence forthcoming from any method of observation,
except that of the galvanometer, to prove that the paths themselves in the cord
are excitable. Indeed, it has long been held by many physiologists that all effects
obtained from stimulation of the spinal cord are due to primary and progressive

excitation of reflex centres (ScHirF, CHAUVEAU). Consequently, it must be under-
stood that the following enumeration of facts is written and arranged in the light of
our experimental results, set forth in the present paper. A. Corona Radiata.

(1.) Latent Period.—The loss of time intervening between the moment of appli-
cation of the stimulus to the corona radiata and the commencement of the resulting
muscular contraction is usually ‘04 sec. (FRANCK and others.)

5 (2.) Eaxcitability—The excitability of the fibres rapidly fails upon their exposure.
