This lateral enlargement forms the body of the young club cell, and having received
‘nucleus from the dividing palisade cell, it commences to grow towards the surface.
ie consequence of this mode of origin, one often finds in vertical sections of early
wes that the slender lower end of the young club cell is wedged in between two
e cells, and still in contact with the basement membrane (see fig. 2, a, b, ¢,
* Plate 30). Though the method of origin above described is by far the most
on, it is also possible for club cells to arise by the method of division of the
e cells at right angles to their long axis (see again fig. 2, ¢, g, and h, Plate 30).
.Phis case the pointed process of the palisade cell grows out, and at the same time
goes the same change as occurs in the formation of the lateral enlargement in
first method, becoming homogeneous and staining browner than the rest of the
dy with Fiemmine’s fluid.
e further development of the club cells will be followed under (b)
) Origin of Goblet Cells from the Palisade Cells—A young goblet is always
iiginguishable from a young club cell in this, that the upper part of the cell instead of
homogeneous and brown in Fiemine’s fluid and saffranine preparations, is finely
rgoulated and stained red. In fact, the transformation of some of the protoplasm
n mucigen occurs before the cell has been constricted off from the palisade cell that

iges it birth (fig. 9a, 1, 2, and 4, Plate 30).

‘the nucleus too, in this early stage, shows a far more distinct nucleolus as a rule
Hn that of the young club cell, and this large nucleolus is a feature in the nucleus of
fee fully developed goblet cell. In the origin of a goblet from a palisade cell, the
He is for the palisade cell to divide at right angles to its long axis, but origin by
GBision parallel to the long axis also occurs. Both of these methods are illustrated
nSfigs. 9a and b, Plate 30.
