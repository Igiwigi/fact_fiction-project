DR. W. H. YOUNG ON THE GENERAL THEORY OF INTEGRATION. 245

content of a plane set containing the set E, and the latter the content of a plane set
contained in E, so that the common limit must be the content of E. In the case
when the function is sometimes positive and sometimes negative, the sum of the
positive terms of the first summation is the content of a set containing E,, and the
sum of the negative terms, taken with positive sign, is the content of a set contained
in E,; similarly the second summation is the content of a component of E, minus the
content of a set containing E,; thus the common limit must be the content of E,
minus that of E,. Thus the two definitions are identical.*

The second of Lesescur’s definitions enables us without difficulty to identify the
Lebesgue integral with the generalised integral which I defined in § 24, In fact,

comparing LeBEsGUE’s notation with that used by myself in § 21, it is clear that

Whence the former of the two given expressions is equal to
