J. ROMANES ON THE LOCOMOTOR SYSTEM OF MEDUSZ. With regard, therefore, to the original point under consideration, I conclude that
although the size of the segments is doubtless one factor in determining the relative
frequency of contraction, there are at least two other factors quite as important, viz. the
relative potency of the lithocysts, and the length of time that elapses between performing-

But although in the case of Sarsia the lesser endurance of the smaller segment than of the larger cannot be
regarded as a general rule, it may be 80 regarded, as already stated, in the case of Aurelia, The following
experiment exemplifies this particular rule even more prettily-than does the one quoted in the text, from the
fact that the 8egments survyived the operation for a greater number of days,

An Aurelia haying a regular and well-sustained rhythm of 20 per minute was divided as already deseribed
in the text. In five minutes intervals on 8uccessive days the average rates of tho four segments were as
follows ;—

Next day the temperature unfortunately rose sufficiently to cause the death of the single surviving segment,
which otheryise would probably have lived for one or two days longer.
