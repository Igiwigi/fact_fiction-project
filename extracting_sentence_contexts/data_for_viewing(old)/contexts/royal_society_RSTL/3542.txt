of which there occurs a high refraction of light. The appearance thus produced,
seems to represent one of the states of the © nucleolus” of authors, in other cells.

58. The centre of the germinal spot undoubtedly communicates at a certain period
with the exterior of the germinal vesicle ; for strong presumptive evidence was
brought forward, showing the introduction of some substance into the centre of this
spot from the exterior of its vesicle. And, besides, I mentioned that in a certain

{ They probably admit of being extended much farther. I cannot, indeed, but recognize in a paper by Pro-
fessor VALENTIN, not merely dissent (in some instances at least) from the view above referred to,—that the
nucleus is cast off as ** wseless,” —but also facts which go to corroborate some of my own observations ; how-
ever little the conclusions at which I arrived, resemble those of the author now mentioned. See MiLLer's
Archiv, 1840, Heft II. pp. 229, 230, and 235. The recent work of Rzicuxrr also, before referred to, contains
observations respecting which I would make the same remark. This author, however, adopts the mistaken
view, that the nucleus of the cell is absorbed. For, considering the germinal yexicle as a nucleus, he therefore
8uppoxes it to disappear (7. c., pp. 102, 103). The ** finely granular” and ** globular precipitate” of Rzrcnerr,
appearing around the nucleus, evidently arose from decompoxition of the free portion of the nucleus (See my
Third Series, . c., par. 391): to which cause seems referable the reduction he observed in the size of this
object (1. c., p. 91).
