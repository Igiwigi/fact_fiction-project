The values of ,/z/« deduced from the annual wave are, of course, much more
trustworthy than those obtained from the half-yearly wave, and the larger discrep-
ancies in the individual results from the latter are not surprising. It is, however,
satisfactory to note how these corroborate the others, showing, for instance, larger
values resulting from the comparison of Nos. 5 and 4 than from that of any other
pair. This may possibly be due to a smaller value of « for the stratum of gravel about
4 feet thick which separates these two thermometers, than for the higher strata, or
to the fact of No. 5 being buried at some distance (9 feet 6 inches) from the vertical
plane containing the other three. Unfortunately, when the pits were open, no very critical examination of the
character of the gravels at different depths was made; but it is proposed to repair
this omission when next the thermometers are dug up. The excessively close agreement of the mean values of /7/« derived from the
annual and half-yearly waves is very remarkable (especially in view of the fact that
the results are deduced from the observations of a single year), and seems to indicate
a high degree of precision in the observations.
