Paper was exposed in this instrument to the light reflected from a large flat card,
uniformly illuminated by sun and sky light, and after development the blackness was
measured. The paper used was cut from sheets specially prepared by the kindness of
Mr. W. Ws11s, of the Platinotype Company, and the sensitiveness of various parts
was tried, and if found to be constant, the rest of the sheet was taken to be com-
parable with those tried. The care with which this paper is prepared is shown by
the fact that with several varieties of paper, procured at intervals of several months,
the sensitiveness showed no variation in gradation of tints. Latterly the formula
seems to have been a little changed, and the sensitometer curve has slightly varied
from that found at first; but this is unimportant, as the results are so reduced as to
be comparable. The term “developing” when applied to this paper may be a little misleading.
