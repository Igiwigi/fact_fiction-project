© Approximate Formule. As the formult of the preceding section require in their use a considerable amount
of calculation, and in some cases the solution of transcendental equations by trial and
error (unless special tables are at hand), it is desirable to have, for the purpose of
Solving ordinary practical problems, approximate formulz of a more simple kind.
'Those which will now be explained were arrived at by a process of trial, based upon
a table of the results of the exact formula ; and their agreement with the exact for-
mulz, and with experiment, has been tested for initial pressures ranging from 30 to
120 lbs. on the 8quare inch, and for ratios of expansion ranging from four to siateen.

They may therefore be applied with confidence to engines working within those limits,
and probably somewhat above them ; but for pressures much exceeding 120 lbs. on the
square inch, and ratios of expansion exceeding 16, it is advisable for the present to use

the exact, formulte. :
'The foundation of the approximate formulz for work, and for mean effective pressure,

is the fact, that for pressures not exceeding 120 Ibs. on the square inch, or 17280 Ibs,
on the square foot, the equation of the curve CDG is very nearly
This equation is very convenient in calculation, because the sixteenth root can be

extracted, with great rapidity, to a degree of accuracy sufficient for practical purposes,
by the aid of a table of squares alone; and by a little additional labour, without any

tables whatsoever. Let 7, as before, be the ratio of expansion ; then evidently,

It is evident, that if the pressure of exhaustion p, be given, and any two out of the
following three quantities, —the initial pressure p,, the mean effective pressure w, the
ratio of expansion 7,—the fourth quantity can be calculated directly, if it is one or other
of the pressures, p,, w, or by approximation, if it is the ratio of expansion 7. The approximate formula for the expenditure of heat, in foot-pounds per pound of
steam, which has been found by trial to agree very closely with the exact formula within
the limits already specified, and when the feed-water is supplied at a temperature of
from 100* to 120” Fanr., is as follows:
