Soon afterwards, the embryo
becomes three-layered owing to the differentiation of the mesoderm from the
endoderm. ‘Thus, differentiation of the endoderm precedes that of the mesoderm.
(ii) Gastrulation may occur by any of the following four processes or their com-
binations, viz., by emboly or invagination, by epiboly or overgrowth, by delamina-
tion, and lastly, by inward migration of cells from one pole of the gastrula. In
alecithal eggs gastrulation is generally a simple, clear process, usually brought about
by epiboly, and the usual sequence of events is neither much delayed nor much
disturbed. On the other hand, in eggs which are rich in yolk, as for example insect
eggs, the whole process of gastrulation becomes complicated owing largely to the
fact that the presence of yolk tends to retard general cell-activity. There exists to-day two main views regarding the nature of gastrulation among
insects.

1. A true blastula stage occurs in insects and is formed when the cleavage cells
reach the egg-periphery.
