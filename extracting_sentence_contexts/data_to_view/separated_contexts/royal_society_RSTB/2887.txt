The increment may be spoken of as the
interlamellay extension of the filament. A comparative glance at sections of Astarte
and Ephippodonta (figs. 22 and 25) will render it clear that, in the latter, what might
at first appear to be very broad laminate filaments united by interfilamentar junctions
at a distance of one-third of their width from the frontal edges, are in reality
composite structures, the outer third of which is constituted by the filament proper
and the inner two-thirds by the interlamellar extension. A further means of dis
tinguishing the filament proper in such cases as this is the fact that the chitinous
lining is thickened in the filament proper but not in its interlamellar extension. If the interlamellar extensions of a descending filament and its corresponding
