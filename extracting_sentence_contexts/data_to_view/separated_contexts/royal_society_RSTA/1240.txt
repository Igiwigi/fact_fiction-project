This method of getting Gaussian tail estimates gives rather poor bounds on the variance. In §5,
we will discuss another method which, when applied to Theorem 5.2, gives a bound that is close
to being optimal.

(a) The factorization method

The so-called factorization method was introduced by Da Prato, Kwapien and Zabczyk [37]
to prove the existence of a continuous version for stochastic convolutions with Co-semigroups
defined on a Hilbert space and was extended to Co-evolution families by Seidler [38]. It is based
on the formula

fc —s)*1(s—1n)-* ds=

sin(a)’
from which one deduces the following identity, valid for 0 <a < 1/2:

| S(t,s)gs dWs =| (t —s)*-1S(E,s) (| (s —r)*S(s,r)gr aw) dr.

For 2<p<oo and dea< b the process Rg(s):= Sols —r)*S(s,r)gydW, belongs to
LP(0, T; LP(2; X)), which we identify with L? (2; L?(0,T; X)), and then use the fact that the mapping
Rah KG — s)*-!S(t,s)Ry(s) ds maps the latter space into L?(2; C([0, T]; X)). Mutatis mutandis this
method extends to the more general setting of 2-smooth Banach spaces. By bookkeeping the norm
estimates and tracking constants, and performing a standard localization argument, the following
result is obtained.
