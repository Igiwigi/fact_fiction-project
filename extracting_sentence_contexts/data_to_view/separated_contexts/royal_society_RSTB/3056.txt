The nucleoplasm becomes constricted in the middle,
and the two halves thus formed gradually move away from one another, sometimes
sliding over one another (26,7). The resulting nuclei may be of the same or different
sizes, and they may have a definite membrane or, more usually, no definite outline,
but extend into processes resembling pseudo-podia (25, 2, 1, 26, a, b). In fact, the
nuclei very often closely resemble amoeboid organisms. In many cases the nuclei of
the two daughter cells begin to divide again before any cell division takes place, so
that in one cell there may be (as in fig. 25, m) one nucleus with two nucleoli
while the other has partly or completely divided into two grand-daughter nuclei.
