branes of which the wing is formed, pigments of different nature and signitican
which may fittingly be termed interlaminar pigments,

As is well known, the chitinous framework of the wing in Lepidoptera may
easily separated, by soaking in water or other means, into two separate lamina,
the space between these is the remains of a cavity which, in the embryo wing,
continuous with the body-cavity. In the imago, when the wings have dried a
emergence from the pupa, these two laminz are more or less adherent ; but, in th
insects I am referring to, they are separated by a small quantity of pigment, which
from its position, is probably related to the blood pigment. From the wings of th
yellow and white Pieride, with which I have chiefly worked, cold water extracts a
brilliant green pigment, which is easily seen, if the scales be removed, to be intej
laminar in origin.
