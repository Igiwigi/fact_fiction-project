The ganglia of the cord
are regarded not only as analogous, anatomically, to the enlarged portions of the cord
in Vertebrata, but physiologically as centres of reflexion, agreeably to the views of
Dr. CareeNnTER; and they also possess a $till more important character and function
in the nervous system, that of being the centres of growth and nutrition to the cord
and nerves, the nuclei contained in them being perhaps the sources of supply and
nourisghment. This is shown from the fact that, in these parts, the fibres of the cord
are 8ofter and larger than in the rest of their course ; and are elongated during the
growth of the body, and the development of new segments ; as is seen in the Polydes-
mide and Geophilide, families from the two divisions of Myriapoda. These additional
facts fully accord with the already ascertained mode of development by extension, or
simple growth of the segments. 2. The examination of the circulatory system has afforded many facts, which appear
equally new and important.
