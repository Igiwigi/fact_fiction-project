It were to be wiſh'd therefore, that ſuch Perſons
as are provided with proper Inſtruments, would at-
tempt to determine, with great Care, the preſent
relative Poſitions of ſeveral of the Principal Stars, in
various Parts of the Heavens ; eſpecially of thoſe, that
are leaſt affected by Refraction: that Cauſe having
many times ſo uncertain an Influence on the Places
of Objects, that are very remote from the Zenith;
that wherever 7t is cohcerned, the Concluſions, de-
duced from Obſervations that are much affected by
it, will always remain doubtful, and too precarious,
in many Caſes, to be relied upon,

The Advantages, ariſing from different Perſons
attempting to ſettle the ſame Points of Alronomy
near the ſametime, are ſo much the greaterzas a Con-
currence in the Reſult, would remove all Suſpicion
of Incorrectneſs in the Inſtruments made uſe of. For
which Reaſon, I eſteem the curious Apparatus at
Shirburn Caſtle, and the Obſervations there raken,
as a moſt yaiuable Criterion, whereby I may judge
of the Accuracy of thoſe, that are made at the Royal
Obſervatory : and as aLover of Science 1 cannot but
with, that our Nation abounded with more frequent
Examples, of Perſons of like Rank and Ability with
your Lordſhip, equally defirous of promoting This,
as well as every other Branch of Natural Know-
ledge, that tends to the Honour and Benefit of our
Country. But were the Patrons of Arts and Sciences ever (0
numerous, the Subject of my preſent Letter is of
ſuch a Nature, as muſt direct me, to beg Leave to
addreſs it to the Earl of Macclesfield; not only as
a moſt competent Judge of ir; but as the ſole Per-

ſon, in this Nation, that hath Inſtruments proper to
examine _into the Truth of the Facts here related. Andit is a particular Satisfaction to me, that after ſo
long an Attendance upon theſe Phenomena, 1 am
allowed the Honour of tranſmitting the Account
of them to the Public, thro' your Lordſhip's Hands :
as it gives me at the ſame time an Opportunity of
profeſling the grateful Senſe I ſhall ever retain, both of
the ſignal Favours which 1 formerly received from
the noble Earl your Father, and of the many recent
Obligations conferr'd by yourſelf upon,
