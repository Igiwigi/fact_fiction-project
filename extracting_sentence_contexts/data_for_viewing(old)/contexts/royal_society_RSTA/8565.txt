It was in this way that many of our observations were made ; but there were cases
in which it was not easy to see the inner limit of the oscillation, and where consequently
its outer limit was all that could be obtained. The plan was then to adjust the helix
effect by tilting the helix until it overpowered the R effect and caused the throws for
both ++ and — magnetisation to be in the same direction in spite of the presence of the
R effect. Each throw was then altered by the oscillation by about the same amount,
and their difference divided by 2 was consequently the correct value of R so far as
error due to the oscillation was concerned.

Of these two methods of eliminating the oscillation error the second is obviously to
be preferred, but it is, unfortunately, not always available. For while it is of primary
importance that the oscillations be small, this fact limits the range of possible tilting of
the helix to an angle so small that it does not always include tilts for which the helix
effect is sufficiently large.

Tn our earlier work the method of reading to the centre of the superposed oscillation

was used, our aim being to keep the helix effect low so that the positive and negative R

effects were more or less equal on opposite sides of zero; and it was not until we

encountered a specimen, which for some reason refused to be adjusted unless the helix
