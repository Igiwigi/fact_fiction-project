While this phenomenon has been observed repeatedly in the past, it has not been well studied Aes
in the context of hazard mitigation. This can be explained by the fact that resolving tsunami 72
current speeds with a numerical model is computationally intensive and requires relatively fine : s

computational mesh sizes resulting in very large numerical grids that require extremely long
run times, making them impractical for many modelling efforts. Furthermore, while there are
several estimates of current speed based on eyewitness accounts, there is a paucity of quantitative
instrumental data on tsunami-induced current speeds making model calibration and validation
difficult. Also, recent studies (e.g. [1]) suggest that eyewitness estimates are generally unreliable
and tend to overestimate actual current speeds.
