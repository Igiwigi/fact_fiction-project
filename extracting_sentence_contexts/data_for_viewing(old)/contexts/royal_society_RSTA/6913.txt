represent the phases. These phases are related to the apparent height of reflexion, and in
the next section we shall consider what can be deduced from them about this height.

11. APPARENT HEIGHT

For the measurement of the apparent height of reflexion on long and very long waves,
the simplest method is that of the * Hollingworthâ€™ interference pattern (Hollingworth 1926).
In this method, measurements are made on the interference pattern formed at the ground
by the combination of the ground and downcoming waves. In its most usual form the
amplitude | EZ, | of the resultant vertical electric field is measured as a function of distance
(x), and the product | Z, | x is plotted against x so as to remove the inverse distance factor
appropriate to the spreading of waves in free space. The curve shows characteristic maxima
and minima, and it is usual to describe it in terms of a fictitious model ionosphere in which
reflexion takes place at a sharp boundary, at a definite height, and possibly accompanied
by a phase change.

Suppose the upgoing wave to be polarized with its electric field in the vertical plane, and
observations to be made on this same component of field in the downcoming wave. The
