It would no doubt be possible to split the subject of integration into partial
fractions, and thus obtain an accurate value as was done in the case of Q;, but it does
not seem worth while to undertake so heavy a task, because a sufficiently exact value
may be obtained by quadratures.

The method is employed in § 18, p. 294, in my paper on “ Stability,” and may be
explained very shortly.

I divide y into 10 or 12 equal parts—say 10 for brevity—and let 6 = yoy.

I then compute eleven equidistant values of the subject of integration, say 1%, wm,
«++ Uo, Corresponding to y = 0, 28, 38, ...108. As a fact it is unnecessary to compute
the first four of these, because they are practically zero.

The equidistant values increase so rapidly that they are very inappropriate for the
application of the rules of numerical quadratures. Accordingly I take an empirical
and integrable function, say v, such that 1%, = %42 and % = Uy, and apply the rules
