In the Homoptera I have examined Aphrophora spumaria, Coccus hesperidum, and
C. persice; Professor HuxLEey (7. c.) has described a species of Aphis, and Profess0r

LEVCKART three or four allied forms. All these present the same type of ovary as the
Hemiptera; but the terminal germ-chamber is generally smaller, and the cells contained
in it much less numerous, being in fact, in C. hesperidum, only three in number. In-
deed in this genus, as there is only one egg in each tube, there is in fact a group of
vitelligenous cells to each egg-chamber ; and this form of ovary forms an intermediate
link between the types found in the Hemiptera and the Hymenoptera. MR. LUBBOCK ON THE OVA AND PSEUDOVA OF INSECTS. 353
