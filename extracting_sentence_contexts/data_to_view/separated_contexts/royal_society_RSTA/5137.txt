sor what is the same
— C{fVE + 9V'n + hV*f}. This is in fact the term invented by MacCu..aau for the purpose of explaining the
otational phenomena of liquids, and of quartz in the direction of its optic axis, and

its curl, that is linear in both ; but probably in all uniaxial erystals, certainly in quartz,
he principal axes of this term are the same as the principal axes of optical elasticity of

37. The objection raised by Sir G. G. Sroxest in 1862 against the possibility of a
edium of the kind contemplated by MacCuLLacu’s energy-function, and since that
Stime generally admitted, is that an element of volume of such a medium when strained
Ss sould not be in equilibrium under the elastic tractions on its boundaries, but would
equire the application of an extraneous couple of amount proportional to its surface,
d therefore very great in proportion to its mass, in order to keep it balanced. Such
state of matters is of course in flagrant contradiction to the character of the elasticity
of solid bodies, and can only occur if there is some concealed rotational phenomenon
Boing on in the element, the kinetic reaction of which can give rise to the requisite
