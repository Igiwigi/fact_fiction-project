increasing temperature should be one due to the different percentage com-
, position of the absorbing layers, so far as the known lines are concerned.
_ With this increasing line absorption there will be a recurrence of the continuous
. absorption in the ultra-violet.
(Stage 3).—With the further thinning of the hydrogen lines and reduction of
temperature of the atmosphere, the absorption flutings of the compounds of
carbon should come in.

So much, then, for what we should expect, assuming the hypothesis to be true.
q I now proceed to show how far these requirements are satisfied by the mass of new

'€ facts now at our disposal.

2 A preliminary account of the photographs of the spectrum of the Orion Nebula
2 aypeken with Instrument E has already been published,* and though the discussion is
&.not yet completed, it may be stated that the lines recorded in the spectrum are at
‘2 wave-lengths which approximate very closely to the lines of hydrogen, to flutings
% which appear in the spectra of compounds of carbon, to a fluting of magnesium at
5 5006, and to the longest flame lines of iron, calcium, and magnesium.
> The chromospheric line designated D, has been recorded in the visual spectrum of
= the Orion Nebula by Dr. Copmnanp,t and the observation has since been confirmed
