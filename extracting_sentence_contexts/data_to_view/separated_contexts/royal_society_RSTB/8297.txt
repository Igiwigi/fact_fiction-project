This simple stay-or-stray decision introduces behavioural
differences between polygynous and polyandrous mating
systems, as females are generally better placed to infer their
reproductive success. Given that a range of complex mate
choice behaviour has been observed, including the avoidance
of parasitism, inbreeding and harassment (see [31] for a
review of mate choice behaviour), it seems reasonable that
a simple binary decision of prior reproductive success or fail-
ure could influence mate choice. In fact, a meta-analysis of
mate fidelity among 35 species of monogamous birds found
that divorce rates were significantly higher among unsuccess-
ful than successful pairs [32], providing strong evidence that
prior reproductive failure can reduce mate fidelity. We consider a population of constant size, composed
of Nm males and N; females, where one sex is polyga-
mous and the other is serially monogamous. We follow
Thrall et al. [7] in assigning members of the serially monog-
amous sex to mating groups consisting of a single member
of the polygamous sex.
