properly 80 called. At the very outset we are met by the difficulty that the motions
taking place within a fluid jet, even when it is not snhjected to vibration, have been
only partially investigated. In what follows, therefore, T shall simply indicate a few

points that seem to me to have been overlooked or not sufficiently dwelt upon in
treating of these phenomena hitherto, and point out certain analogies which may

at least serve as guides to further experiment, even if they answer no other purpose.

Briefly stated, the facts to be accounted for are the following :â€”

An .impulse given to the fluid at a jet orifice, or to the orifice itself, gives rise to
some kind of disturbance which probably moves forward with the mean velocity of
the stream, and therefore involves always the originally disturbed particles, or those
immediately adjoining them. If the velocity were different for different disturbances,
accurate reproduction of complex sounds at a distance from the orifice would be

impossIble.
