In the accompanying table the masses and radii of the sun, and of those
planets which possess satellites, are given in the first two columns; the value of
mass/(radius)? is given in the third. The units are so chosen that the earth is
measured by unity in each of these columns. Venus is included for the sake of
comparison, although the existence of a satellite is extremely doubtful,

If our hypotheses give a fair account of the facts the numbers in this third column
will be proportional to /\@. Assuming for ¢ the uniform value ¢=2, we can
calculate the actual values of \,, and these are given in the fourth column.

§ 28. Knowing nothing about the variation in \y, we shall be content as a
preliminary hypothesis to suppose it to have the same value for each planet.
