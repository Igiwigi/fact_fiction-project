1.) is 80 like the appearance of one of the crystals which I have described, that it
might be supposed to have been intended for a representation of it. MR. TALBOT ON THE OPTICAL PHENOMENA OF CERTAIN CRYSTALS. 27

Having pointed out this resemblance, I may also mention another class of facts to
which I think those I have described possess a considerable analogy. I mean the
optical figures which BrewsreR has discovered in spheres of glass whose density was
rendered variable by heating them. He says* that, * if we take a cold sphere of glass and immerse it in a trough of
hot oil, placed in a polarizing apparatus, we ball observe @ black cross with four
sectors of polarized light.
