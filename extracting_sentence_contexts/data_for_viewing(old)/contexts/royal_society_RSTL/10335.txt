Finally, when the action of the acid has been carried too far, the processes appear
to have been partially destroyed, and but few can be traced as far as the swollen and
now deeply-stained middle lamella. Many of the processes appear to be directly and
uninterruptedly continuous from cell to cell, whilst others are swollen at the point
where they cross the middle lamella. In other cases between the two ends of the
strongly-stained processes there is a lighter-stained portion, which connects the two
This lighter-stained area exhibits a haziness and appears to be somewhat indistinct,
although well defined from the rest of the swollen cell-wall, and clear enough not to be
confounded with the middle lamella (Plate 68, fig. 5). Again, when the protoplasm is
but slightly contracted, and but little tension has been exerted on the threads, the point
of junction of the two threads is both slightly swollen and also coloured darker than
the rest. In spite, however, of the fact that in several cases direct continuity appears
to exist, I am s8trongly of opinion, both from analogy and from such appearances as I
las described, that in reality a sieve-plate arrangement occurs. It must be borne
in mind that the difficulties of examination are great, both on account of the smallness
of the pits and the thinness of the pit membranes, but in any case we cannot, imagine
that the threads go bodily through the pit, for were it 80, the pits would not possess
a closing membrane, and ordinary staining would goon demonstrate the existence of
the protoplasm, by which the pit was perforated.

Although Pezpegr's* results appear to prove that it is the underside of the
pulvinus which is especially sensitive, T have not been able to establish any difference
between them as far as histological evidence goes. Nor is this to be greatly wondered
at, for the method for such a discrimination is essentially rough, and one would hardly
