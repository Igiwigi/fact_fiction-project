19. To determine whether the integral is a true maximum or minimum, we have
‘iow only to find whether the terms of this order @° in (8) will be always of
She same sign when the variations are given in any values consistent with the
Sonditions given in Art. 18, For it is evident that, if we restrict ourselves to a less
Szeneral variation in examining the sign of the second variation, we could neither

sure that the conditions obtained were sufficient to ensure that the integral
gas synclastic, though they would be necessary ; nor that the conditions that it
should be anticlastic were necessary, though they would be sufficient. If, on the
Sther hand, we were to admit a more general variation, the conditions for synclasticism
Swould be sufficient, but not necessary, and those for anticlasticism would be neither
Esufficient nor necessary. In fact, it will be found that the conditions under which we
Pare discussing the problem are really those necessary in order that it shall have a

meaning. For instance, in the case of least action, when we say that the action in
the free path is less than in any other, we imply that there is to be no sudden change
