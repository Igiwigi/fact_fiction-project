performance. Following the traditional view that the conductor
conveys mostly the expressive content of music, some studies
have investigated the effectiveness by which conductors’ ges-
tures evoke the desired expressive content and the
combination of kinematic features that maximize such classifi-
cation [78]. Investigations of the temporal aspects of
coordination have shown that musicians could effectively syn-
chronize with point-light display of a conductor's gestures,
provided that these comply with biological motion rules.
Importantly, visual cues were as effective as auditory ones
[79]. Furthermore, it was shown that conductors, even more
than musicians, are capable of precise synchronization with
an external visual stimulus. This fact suggests that orchestra
conductors are specifically tuned to the detection of salient kin-
ematic features of body gestures that allow temporal prediction
and estimation [80]. Interestingly, one study investigated the
perception of conductors’ body movements under different
viewing conditions. Video sequences presenting the conduc-
tors’ faces induced higher expressiveness ratings than the
arms-only conditions. At the same time, sequences showing
the arms were judged higher in amount of information [81].
In agreement with this result, it has been shown that conduc-
tors’ eye movements are directed at the score, but most of the
score-reading was in anticipation of the music to be played.
Interestingly, the longest anticipations were associated with
