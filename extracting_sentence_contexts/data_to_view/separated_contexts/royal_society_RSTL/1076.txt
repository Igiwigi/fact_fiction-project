degree of oxygenation, may have an affinity for nitrogene, or potassium may expel a
portion of hydrogene at the moment of its combination with ammonium; and as the
whole of the ammonia cannot be. regenerated without the presence of water; hydro-
gene and a little oxygene may be furnished to the remaining elements of the ammonia,
from the water, and oxygene to the potassium. Even before the conclusion was formed, that a metallic 5ubstance is decomposed in
this experiment, it 5hould have been proved that the nitrogene had not been altered,

That mere potash, combined with hydrogene, eannot form potassium, is I think

ascertained by M. M. Gay Lussac, and THExaRD, of the deoxydation of potash by
iron.
