to EZ. acutus (Plate 25, tig. 122). Plate 25, fig. 118, shows the typical shape and
tuberculation of FH. csculentus. Plate 25, fig. 119, is a true ZH. eseulentus, but the
primary tubercles are rather more prominent than usual. Plate 25, figs. 120 and 121,
are so intermediate (especially fig. 121) in general shape and in the arrangement of
the tubercles between 4. esculentus and F. acutus, that it can scarcely be doubted
that they are really hybrids. Plate 25, fig. 122, is a typical test of FL. acutus.

The foregoing is a précis of the report on the specimens figured in Plate 25,
figs. 108-122, which was given us by Dr. Morrensen. It will be seen that
E. esculentus and E. acutus both vary towards one another, but that some individuals
are so exactly intermediate that they cannot fairly be said to belong to one species
or the other. It seems quite probable that these examples are natural hybrids. This
is supported by the fact that hybrids between these two species raised in the
laboratory are more or less intermediate in character between both parent species.

As mentioned above, /. miliaris is typically a shore species. The material used
in these experiments was mostly obtained at low spring tides from Wembury Bay
and from Cawsand Bay. ‘The urchins are usually found under large boulders and in
crevices of the rocks,

E. miliaris is subject to considerable variation in general shape (the test being
sometimes extremely depressed), in coloration, and in the length and stoutness of
