218 Mr. cazauD's Method' of

The natural hiſtory of the cane,

There are but few of the minute particulars I a
going to mention, but what are ſome how or other con:
| nected with my method.

The upper part of the cane, commonly called the
head, is the beſt plant that can be uſed to propagate it,
ſe fig. 7. ſee likewiſe fig. 1.; it is the part from / to 7
which in this figure is without its leaves. It is a kno
fact, that the body of the cane does not come up well
unleſs there are continued rains from the time of its be
ing put into the ground, till all the ſhoots are out and
pretty ſtrong.

Hifto!
