Some results of calculation of the deformation ¢5¢ versus the applied field Hy are shown in figure 7.

Kinetics of the striction are determined by the initial value Go of the elastic modulus and the
relaxation time t. The modulus Go cannot be less than the storage modulus G’, measured at the
relatively high oscillations of the sample. Taking into account that G’, presented in figure 2, is
practically independent of the oscillation frequency and equals 820 Pa, we estimate Gy ~ 820 Pa.
At the same time, we fit t ~ 440s.

The results of calculations of the deformation ¢ versus time t are presented in figure 8.
Note that at a short-term period of time t, the curvature of the experimental dependence of ¢
versus f is negative (figure 2), whereas the calculated one is positive. This disagreement can be
explained by the fact that the simple phenomenological relation (3.21) corresponds only to large
enough time intervals ¢. Analysis of the small time after the sample loading requires the detailed
microscopical study of the internal mechanisms which affect the macroscopical time-dependent
elastic modulus G.
