In this species the blood-corpuscles are large relatively to the proportions of the
body. On bursting in the field their contents fibrillate in a very obvious manner. In every observation I have been attentive to note this interesting fact ; it may avail
some future theorist. The blood of the Amphipode is distinguished for the prevailing orbicular character
of its floating cells. The elliptical figure seldom occurs.
