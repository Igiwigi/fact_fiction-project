the purpose of minimizing visual impact and harnessing the large resources available; it has been
estimated, for instance, that only the wind resource potential at 5-50 nautical miles off the US
coast could provide the total electrical generating capacity currently installed in the USA (more
than 900 GW) [14].

In past years, a number of international standards and guidelines have been released for design
and assessment of offshore wind turbines [15-17]. In the meanwhile, numerical modelling has
progressed towards more sophisticated descriptions of structural components, mechanical and
electrical subsystems of modern offshore wind turbines, along with an appropriate treatment
of the incident wind and wave fields. Existing numerical models rely on modal representation,
multi-body, finite-element (FE) concepts, sometimes combined in mixed approaches, and involve
system motion equations to be solved by fully coupled nonlinear time-domain integration, to
account for inherent interactions between aerodynamic and hydrodynamic responses. In fact,
while aerodynamic loads on the rotor are to be derived from aeroelastic models, considering


the complex interaction between air flow and rotor blades, the influence of control systems
and support structure dynamics, the latter affects the calculation of the hydrodynamic loads.
Hence, although in some cases and especially in the early stages of design, simplified analyses
are implemented with responses to wind and wave loads computed separately and next
superposed [18,19], only fully integrated time-domain simulations are currently recommended as
the basis of final, detailed wind turbine design calculations, owing to the role played by system
nonlinearities inherent to rotor aerodynamics, hydrodynamics and control systems [20-22].
