Because such fluctuating selection unfolds over short
ecological time scales—typically much faster than the time
scales of gene duplications and losses—it is possible that
maintenance of polymorphism by, for example, allelic vari-
ation is more relevant and would manifest itself as patterns
of balancing selection [29]. Yet, the existence of hidden polymorphism in AMPs [29]
does not preclude the possibility that hosts respond to infection
by expressing appropriate cocktails of AMPs. In fact, bumblebee
hosts express a mixture of AMPs depending both on their gen-
etic background (i.e. the colony) and on the infecting strain [47]. Hence, a reasonable conjecture is that hosts tend to express the
most effective mixture of AMPs that fits the current infection. We cannot test this conjecture here with the available data, not
least because expression levels are not always identical to the
level of circulating proteins (AMPs).
