However, the proposed framework is equally applicable to the case wherein
such criteria are defined in a non-harmonized manner.


resistances and reactances, import/export stability, etc.) which are again the synthesis of all intra-
area physical parameters. Therefore, any single TSO may create a negative value to the group due
to its respective part of the system security limitations and due to the physical parameters of its
control area. To introduce the positive contribution, beyond the basic fact that electricity flows through the
TSO operated infrastructure, we underline the sharing of grid flexibility. The ability to re-route
power flows with grid flexibility resources can be used to achieve operational cost savings and
operational reliability [16,27]. Co-optimizing such resources along with the resources offered by
the market actors enlarges the space of actions that can be used to achieve the multi-area system
security [24].
