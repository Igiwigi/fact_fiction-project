some period or other have formed the intermediate step.

The author of the Recherches sur les Egyptiens seems un-
willing to admit that real mummies had ever been introduced
at. table : but his scepticism appears to me to be no better
founded than the contrary assertion of one of the most eminent
physicians of the last century, Case. HorFMANN, who in his
once classical work de 'Medicamentis Officinalibus, in the section
of the Egyptian mummies, gravely relates, that in Lower
Saxony no feast was ever given without the introduction of a
mummy.* And strange as this quz pro quo between an Egyp-
tian corpse and a particular kind of Brunswick strong beer
must appear, it is however a fact, that several more modern
writers upon mummies have actually copied it out into their
works with implicit confidence.

* P. 642. « A Saxonibus audivi, nullum apud ipsos convivium transigi posse, Sine

« mummei, uti appellant. Ita olim sine lasere, et hodie Indi sine asa foztida nihil co-
« medunt, Hinc, qui in Zgyptum eunt afferre secum solent taliz cadavera.”
