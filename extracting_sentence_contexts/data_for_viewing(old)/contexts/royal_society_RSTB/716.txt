original source of the “ plant,” and very little indeed is known as to its real nature.
The following studies will at least clear up many of the difficulties on the latter point ;
but I have met with no success in direct answer to enquiries as to when the Ginger-
beer Plant was first discovered, and how it was introduced into this country, or what
first led people to employ it in making the beverage which gives it its name.

Professor BayLEY Ba.rour states :* “it is said the Ginger-beer Plant was intro-
duced into Britain by soldiers from the Crimea, in 1855 ;” but so far as I can discover
this was a mere conjecture, and is not to be taken as an accepted piece of history.

Dr. Ransome informs me, in a letter dated April, 1891, “some say it was brought
from Italy,” but this, again, I have failed to substantiate more definitely. ‘The whole
question as to whence it was first derived, in fact, is enshrouded in mystery; and it
is to be hoped that these studies may so draw attention to the matter that some light
will be thrown upon it at a future time. All agree that it is handed on from family
to family much in the same way as yeast or “ barm” is by brewers and bakers.

As to its nature, the most conflicting views have been put forward. Passing over
various mere conjectures to the effect that it consists of forms of Penicillium, Mucor, or
other Mould-Fungi, the sequel will show that the nearest approach to the real state of
affairs is BaLrour’s suggestiont that it is composed of a Yeast and a Bacterium.
Grove, in his ‘Synopsis of the Bacteria and Yeast Fungi,’t regards it as consisting of
a Yeast, Mycoderma, various species of Bacillus, together with Pasteur’s “ Mucor-
ferment” ; but he gives no evidence of having examined the matter in detail, and, as
the sequel will show, he entirely misses the main point. Notes on the subject have
