If a photograph be taken of the spark on the rotating film, the image is always
drawn out most near the middle of the spark, and we obtain images such as fig. 31.
It is not quite easy to see why the metallic particles should remain luminous in the
centre of the spark longer than near the pole, unless there is some inflow of cold air
from the poles inwards. Such an inflow might be produced through the effects of
rarefaction produced by the initial heating of the air by the spark.

8. Sources of Error.

Different photographs, obtained exactly in the same way, sometimes differ con-
siderably in the value they give for the molecular velocity, and there is little doubt
that the chief cause of error lies in the fact that the discharge is not a straight line
parallel to the slit, but takes place in irregular curves, and, as appears already on
Dr. Feppersen’s photographs, the successive oscillations of the same discharge take
sometimes very different courses. When we first began to work we used smaller
capacities, and our results were more irregular, because the course of the discharge
was more erratic. The large capacity acts in the direction of making the path of the
discharge straighter, unless the sparking gap becomes too great. If the molecular
stream is a straight line, our calculations are based on the further assumption that
the image of the point of divergence falls exactly on the slit. If that point is at
a distance h, measured perpendicularly to the slit, the molecules would have to
traverse a distance \/y' + A’, if the projection of the distance along the slit is y.
Calling V the velocity of the molecular stream, v that of the photographie film, it
follows from « = Vt and vt = /y* + 1? that
