The
IPCC 2019 special report on the ocean and cryosphere [19] states that ‘Observations, both in situ
(2004-2017) and based on sea surface temperature reconstructions, indicate that the AMOC has
weakened relative to 1850-1900 (medium confidence)’, and that ‘The AMOC is projected to weaken
in the 21st century under all RCPs (very likely), although a collapse is very unlikely (medium
confidence)’. The latest IPCC 2021 report [20] states that ‘While there is medium confidence that
the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) will not experience an abrupt collapse
before 2100, if it were to occur, it would very likely cause abrupt shifts in regional weather patterns
and water cycle’ and ‘it is very likely that AMOC will decline over the 21st century’. The fact
that the AMOC is projected to weaken under the latest IPCC scenarios and confidence in that
projection has grown since 2001 (now considered very likely) means that going forward into the
twenty-first century there will be climatic impacts as a result of that weakening. Suffice to say
that knowing the present state of the AMOC, and its past behaviour, are both important if the
impact of AMOC changes under global warming are to be predicted and taken into account in
formulating governmental policy responses such as mitigation or adaptation.

3. New observations

Since 2003 significant progress in observing the Atlantic overturning has been made.
