were it not for the fact that the older writers, such as LAPLACE and Porsson, who accepted
these assumptions, also laid the foundations of the modern theory of statistics, and have
introduced into their discussions of this subject ideas of a similar character. I must
indeed plead guilty in my original statement of the Method of the Maximum Likeli-
hood (9) to having based my argument upon the principle of inverse probability ; in the
same paper, it is true, | emphasised the fact that such inverse probabilities were relative
only. That is to say, that while we might speak of one value of p as having an inverse
probability three times that of another value of p, we might on no account introduce
the differential element dp, so as to be able to say that it was three times as probable
that p should lie in one rather than the other of two equal elements. Upon considera-
tion, therefore, I perceive that the word probability is wrongly used in such a connection :
probability is a ratio of frequencies, and about the frequencies of such values we can
know nothing whatever. We must return to the actual fact that one value of p, of
the frequency of which we know nothing, would yield the observed result three times
as frequently as would another value of p. If we need a word to characterise this
relative property of different values of p, I suggest that we may speak without confusion
of the likelihood of one value of p being thrice the likelihood of another, bearing always
in mind that likelihood is not here used loosely as a synonym of probability, but simply
to express the relative frequencies with which such values of the hypothetical quantity
p would in fact yield the observed sample.

The solution of the problems of calculating from a sample the parameters of the
hypothetical population, which we have put forward in the method of maximum likeli-
