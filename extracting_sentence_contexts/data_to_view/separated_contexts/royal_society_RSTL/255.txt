5 But the Society being of late years greatly enlarged, and their com-
munications more numerous, it was thought advisable, that a Com-
mittee of their members should be appointed, to reconsider the papers
read before them, and select out of them such as they should judge
most proper for publication in the future Transactions ; which was
accordingly done upon the 26th of March, 1752. And the grounds

of their choice are, and will continue to be, the importance and sin-
gularity of the subjects, or the advantageous manner of treating them;
without pretending to answer for the certainty of the facts, or pro-
priety of the reasonings, contained in the several papers so published,
which must till rest on the credit or judgment of their respective
authors. ;

It is likewise necessary on this occasion to remark, that it is an esta-
blished rule of the Society, to which they will always adhere, neyer to
give their opinion, as a Body, upon any subject, either of Nature or
Art, that comes before them. And therefore the thanks which are
frequently proposed from the Chair, to be given to the authors of such
papers as are read at their accustomed meetings, or to the persons through
whose hands they receive them, are to be considered in no other light
than as a matter of civility, in return for the respect shewn to the So-
ciety by those communications.
