Another way to phrase the
question is to ask what kind of rituals (should they exist)
would we expect apes to have? Our answer to this was that
we would expect these ape rituals to involve symbolic mean-
ingful results. This proposal stems from the fact that apes
seem to frequently express their ability to match results (see
above), and from the fact that their potential for symbolic,
causally- and goal-opaque results remains currently relatively
untested. Future studies should therefore focus on testing ape
symbolic abilities in the results domain. It might be possible
that apes may be naturally susceptible to at least understand
symbols when the symbol involves object changes, rather
than fixed object states.
