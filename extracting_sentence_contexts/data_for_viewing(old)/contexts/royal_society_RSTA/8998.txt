The application of the D qualification test is unfortunately here nugatory on
account of the smallness of the oun. It is, however, striking that so many of the F
separations put themselves in evidence. This agreement adds considerable weight to
the allocation. The evidence is also practically convincing when the Watson
separations are brought into evidence as is done a few paragraphs below. Support is
also given in the doublet system shown in connection with 20826, which show the
same small displacements as are exhibited in the first of the parallel F sets adduced
above. In this case to 20869 as a D, would correspond a [20820] as a D, 269°39
ahead of 20551, whereas the F is 12°73 behind the corresponding F, line (17081).
If the two sets correspond, i.c., the d sequent and the F (c) for this set are the same,
the D group must belong not to 20551 but to a parallel D group in which the limit
is 812°73—269°39 = 43°34 behind the normal D(). Now this is the separation of
20556 behind 20600. In fact the separation of 20556 and 20869 is 312'66. This
further indicates that 20556 is a D, line in the position shown in the above table, in
which the corresponding D, line is too weak to have been seen. This also gives another
F separation—85—with 20642. The change 44°13 on the D limit requires a displace-
ment on the mantissa of 611 and 4243 = 611°3, which is exact. The », corresponding

to this new limit, with A, = 666, is 48°30. The difference between this and the
observed 48°78 is just within our assumed possible errors on two lines.
