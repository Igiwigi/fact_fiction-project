whilst the corresponding values of @, are 275°, 250°, 285°, and 270° respectively. From the latter numbers the curious result follows that the absolute temperature,
between the limits specified, was directly proportional to the current producing it. In fact, it was seen from the data that the actual temperature between 300° C. and
800° C. produced by any current could be obtained correctly within a few degrees by
determining a single temperature corresponding to a single given current, and then
assuming in further experiments that the absolute temperature would be proportional
to the current applied. There were only a few measurements at temperatures above 800°C. The data
seem to show that the @c curve slowly departs from linearity and becomes concave to
the axis of temperature.
