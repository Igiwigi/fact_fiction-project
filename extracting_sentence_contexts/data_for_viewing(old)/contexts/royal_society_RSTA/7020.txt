was used to operate a Post Office-type counter. An auxiliary contact on one of the electric
clocks automatically connected the counter in circuit for 50 sec. The number of beats
between the two 200 kc. frequencies in this time gave the frequency difference directly in
parts in 10’, Although the B.B.C. only claim to keep their frequency constant to 1 in 10°, it
was seldom found that the relative rates differed by more than +2 in 107 from their mean
value. It took only a few minutes to check the rate of both frequency standards. Except at
one or two of the most remote stations, where the signal strength was insufficient to operate
the counter, the system worked most satisfactorily throughout the entire voyage.

2:5. ACCELEROMETERS

When a Vening Meinesz pendulum apparatus is used the quantity which is directly
determined is the mean phase velocity of the fictitious pendulum. Since the period of a
pendulum depends on the inverse square root of the resultant acceleration acting on it, the
mean phase velocity observed when the resultant acceleration fluctuates will in general
differ from the value that would have been observed had the acceleration remained con-
stant at its mean value. It has been shown (Browne 1937) that if the period of the fluctua-

value of gravity calculated from the observed mean phase velocity given by
