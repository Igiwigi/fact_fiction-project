This property may become increasingly important as
the time step length in the UC problem decreases, to better deal with renewable uncertainty. Additionally, as mentioned, the computed dual solution gives a price signal with minimal uplifts. In fact, Electricit√© de France has a long tradition of using Lagrangian relaxation, that goes
back to the seminal work [12]. The approach continues to be used nowadays, adapted to the
market setting, to compute half-hour dispatch and prices [13]. Due to the constraints on the
operational process in France, the problem needs to be solved in less than 10 min, with very
strong requirements both on optimality and feasibility (all schedules must be feasible and a 1%
gap adds up into several millions of euros per year).
