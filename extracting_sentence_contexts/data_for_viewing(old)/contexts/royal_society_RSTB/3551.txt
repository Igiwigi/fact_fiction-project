directly confluent with, and continued into, the localised thickening at the base of
the trigeminal lobe and in front of the transverse constriction seen in section in
figs. 84 and 85. But this appearance of continuity is entirely fallacious, for, as must
already have become apparent, the opacity of the two regions is the effect of quite
different structural conditions. The medullary fold ends posteriorly in a tolerably
abrupt fashion, whilst the small basal trigeminal ganglionic thickening behind it is
really continued, not into the medullary rim, but in a forward and outward direction
alongside of the medullary rim, and even partially overlapped by the free margin of
the latter, as may be recognised in fig. 86,

It has been stated previously that in the slightly older Specimen M the specialised
thickening in the anterior part of the basal region of the Trigeminus lobe is no longer
apparent (cf. fig. 75). In consequence of this fact, the boundaries of the transverse
encephalic constriction are in this specimen more clearly evident. The medial
marginal part of the anterior extension of the trigeminal plate still shows somewhat
greater opacity than the body of the plate. Fig. 87, Plate 15, represents a low-power
photomicrograph of a transverse section through Specimen M ina plane a few sections

behind the posterior limit of the medullary fold, and therefore passing through the
region of the encephalic constriction. In this photomicrograph the distinction
between the “neural crest” cells constituting the great Trigeminus ganglionic plate or
lobe, on the one hand, and the mesodermal cells underlying the medullary plate, and
