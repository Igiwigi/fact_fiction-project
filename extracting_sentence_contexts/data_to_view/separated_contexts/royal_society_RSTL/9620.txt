Thus the whole question as between the two hypotheses amounts
to whether the pedicels are able to act serially from oral to ab-oral pole. Observation
has shown us that they are 80, for we have een Zchini spontaneously rear themselyes
from their normal position on the oral pole, to the position of resting upon their
equators. Further, as additional evidence that the righting movements are ab least
assisted by some centralizing influence, is the fact that when the evolution is nearly
completed by the pedicel-rows engaged in executing it, the lower pedicels in the other
rows become strongly protruded and curved downwards, in anticipation of shortly
coming into contact with the floor of the tank. But, on the other hand, there is evidence to show that the action of the pedicels in
executing this manceuvre, although as we have seen in s0me measure, is not exclusively
dependent upon this centralizing influence. We found that the centre from which
this influence proceeds is the nerve-ring that surrounds the lantern.
