of our rivers to the extent even of producing inundations more of the character of those
indicated (at page 276) by the position of the brick-earth, or of those of arctic regions.
Such a result might have been formerly obtained, 1st, by a direct increase in the
rainfall ; 2ndly, by the accumulation and rapid melting of the winter snow ; or by the
two causes combined ; and 3rdly, by the fall of rain in the spring while the ground was
in a frozen state ||.

The line of 35 inches rainfall now touches the north-western point of France, the
western point of England, and the south-western part of Ireland. An adyance inland
of this line, arising from the greater precipitation determined by the low temperature
of the land surface, would result from a general winter covering of snowâ€”the accom-
paniment of a climate of the character we have inferred. It may be objected that,
Judging from the fact of the decrease generally observed in the rainfall in proceeding

of twenty to fifty miles, but we are without information on this point. The rain for the month was 7-36 inches
