By contrast, true lethals
where A and 6 are the birth and death rates of suscep- cannot be modelled in the continuum-of-allele-
tible cells and v is the death rate of infected cells. The model. The occurrence of true lethals is described by
fact that all viruses are assumed to have the same death a simple unidirectional mutation process towards the
rate implies that fitness differences among viruses are lethal class (no compensatory mutations are allowed). Phil. Trans.
