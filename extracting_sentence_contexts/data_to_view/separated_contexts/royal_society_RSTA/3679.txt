We obtain 1; =54+7 fs, meaning that the Ian* > Inon* population transfer is about 70%
after 100 fs (see the S; line in figure 7). Note that this is substantially different from the results
reported for uracil and thymine in previous SA-CASSCF-based dynamics simulations, where
much less was transferred within 100 fs, because longer time constants were obtained for this
pathway [21,24,59-62]. This difference is due to the fact that at SA-CASSCF level the lin* state
is higher in energy than with MRCIS, and therefore population transfer from â€˜22* to tnom* is
slower at SA-CASSCF level. The second time constant we obtain is t2 = 450 + 100 fs. That is, within 400 fs, 51% of the non-
dissociating trajectories have moved to the triplet states and 49% are still in the singlet manifold.
