For if the north fluid be supposed to be
attracted towards the influencing north pole, it is absurd to suppose that its pre-
sence there could produce repulsion. The theory of AmpERE is equally at a loss to
explain diamagnetic action ; for, if we suppose the particles of bismuth surrounded
by molecular currents, then according to all that is known of electro-dynamic laws,
these currents would set themselves parallel to, and in the same direction as those of
the magnet, and hence attraction, and not repulsion, would be the result. The fact,
however, of this not being the case proves that these molecular currents are not
the mechanism by which diamagnetic induction is effected. The consciousness of
this, I doubt not, drove M. Were to the assumption that the phenomena of diamag-
netism are produced by molecular currents, not directed, but actually excited in the
bismuth by the magnet. Such induced currents would, according to known laws,
have a direction opposed to those of the inducing magnet, and hence would pro-
duce the phenomena of repulsion.
