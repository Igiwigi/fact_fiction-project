structure.

T have been enabled to make out some points as to the relation of this reticulum
to spindle formation in the division of the segmentation nuclei.

No trace of cell wall is to be found in connection with the spindles formed at the
division of these nuclei; after division the spindle simply fades away into the general
cytoplasm. Figs. 28 and 29 show stages in the disappearance of the spindle. In such
a preparation as fig. 28 a definite spindle is still to be seen between the two segmen-
tation nuclei ; the spindle has no distinct periphery, but gradually passes over into the
ordinary reticulum ; the threads of the spindle can be distinctly traced into the
threads of the reticulum. Fig. 29 shows a little later stage in this process of
extinction of the spindle; the spindle in fact hardly exists as such, but is only to be
distinguished as a reticulum with small meshes ; this reticulum passes over directly
into the wider meshed general reticulum.

3 These observations agree completely with those of WrLson (21) on the cytoplasm
S in the egg of the Sea Urchin. Farmer and WILLIAMs (20) made similar observations
in the oogonia and oosphere of Fucus.

Such observations as these militate strongly against the view of a special spindle
forming substance, either archoplasmic or kinoplasmic (cf. SrRAsBURGER (12)). They
point to the fact that the spindle forming or kinoplasmic fibres result from a
rearrangement of the ordinary cytoplasmic reticulum.
