23. Much more often the splits are confined to one of the series of planes of
separation and shreds are produced which show striz or slip-lines. The anisotropy
of the cell-wall probably explains the fact that the inclination of the planes of
separation, as manifested by the splits and the striae on the shreds, is not 45Â° to the
direction of the stress. The inclination of the planes of separation as seen on the surfaces of the walls,
unlike that of the gliding planes, which have been decribed above, for compression
failures, is similar to, or identical with, that of the slits of the pits. This corre-
spondence between the inclination of the splits and that of the pit-slits, as well as the
possible nature and effect of the natural anisotropy of the cell-wall will, be discussed
below, in connection with the general questions bearing on the internal structure of
the woody cell-walls.
