could state that hydrogels with adequate (large) porosity to allow proliferation of cells and
diffusion of nutrients and waste in the artificial growing tissues are mechanically too weak. On the
contrary, when care is taken (for example, by using strongly cross-linked, concentrated polymer
networks) to prepare hydrogels that match the mechanical properties of target tissues, the results
are hydrogels with reduced porosity that hinders the proliferation of cells, and thus prevents
an appropriate generation of artificial tissues. Several approaches aimed at combining adequate
mechanical properties and internal structures have been studied, including the use of inorganic
nanomaterials in combination with polymers to strengthen the network without reducing the
porosity [6-8].

Although, as discussed above, the mechanical strength and degree of porosity of hydrogels
intended for applications in tissue engineering are very important factors, not less relevant is
their anisotropy, which is an aspect that is usually disregarded in most studies. In fact, most
hydrogels are synthesized by homogeneous assembly of building blocks, resulting in isotropic
networks, in contrast with most biological systems, such as muscle tissue [9,10], skin tissue [11,12]
or cartilage tissue [13,14], which present well-defined hierarchical, anisotropic structures. In these
tissues, anisotropy plays an essential role, making possible particular processes such as mass
transfer, surface lubrication and force generation. As an example, muscle contraction results from
the anisotropic disposition of actin-myosin within the sarcomere [9,10]. Furthermore, it is also
well known that other processes, such as cell proliferation, migration and differentiation, are also
influenced by the anisotropy of the extracellular matrix of the host tissue [15-18].

Unfortunately, the preparation of anisotropic hydrogels by biocompatible processes is a
difficult task, which requires the application of directional stimuli to the hydrogels, either during
the building steps or after the finalization of the cross-linking process [19]. Examples include the
