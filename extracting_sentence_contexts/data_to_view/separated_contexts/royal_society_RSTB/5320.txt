Some of these were flies
bred-out from collected pupw, but the bulk of them were taken by sweeping through the
plot of oats with a muslin net on July 17 and 20. A few were dissected immediately
after being anesthetised by chloroform, but most of them were preserved in 70 per cent.
alcohol and dissected later.

The numbers reveal the fact that although amongst the flies dissected there was a
large preponderance of females, yet amongst the infected ones there was a slightly larger
number of males than females. The writer cannot advance any adequate explanation
of this. It may be that normal males are more active on the wing than parasitised
ones and so escaped capture.
