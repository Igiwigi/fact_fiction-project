recording, which relates to a transition from isothermal conditions at room temperature to the
dynamic heating segment of the DSC analysis (figure 3). In experiments with less than 4 wt% H20,
the low-temperature heating segment characterized by the beforementioned artefact is followed
by a plateau representing the equilibrium state of the glass before the onset of the glass transition
into the supercooled liquid state is calorimetrically detected. As the sample is heated at a rate
of 10K min“, the temperature of the glass transition (taken as the peak position corresponding
to the heat flow peak overshoot, hereafter referred to as Tg, peak) decreases systematically with
increasing dissolved bulk water content in the carbonate glass from 245°C (519K) at 0.02 wt%
H20 to 83°C (356K) at 10.43 wt% HO at a cooling rate of 10K min~!. However, in hydrous
glasses containing more than 4 wt% H2O only Tg, peak could be identified and the glass transition
on Tg onset was overlain by the broad artificial peak below 120°C. The difference between the
Tg onset and Tg, peak is on average 14+2K (independent of the initial amount of water). We
could therefore estimate the extrapolated Tg onset (our proxy for Tg, fictive) for all samples, by
applying the temperature correction (thermal lag) determined by the melting points of pure
metals (subtracting of 4.5 K) and then further subtracting these 14K. Temperature corrected data
are listed in table 2.

(a) Carbonate glass transition temperature—bulk H70 relationship

Figure 4 displays the limiting fictive temperature of the carbonate-water solution as a function
of the carbonate weight fraction content. The glass transition temperature of pure water is
taken from literature [35,36]. The data show that increasing water content decreases the glass
transition temperature of the amorphous mixture. Such a plasticizing effect can be described
