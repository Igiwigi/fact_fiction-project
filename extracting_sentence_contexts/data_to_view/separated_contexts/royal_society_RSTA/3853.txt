On this basis, firms are highly incentivized to keep control of data from LMICs
because they have high value as a proprietary resource that contains insights about business
processes and customer preferences as well as the potential for professional learning and positive
perceptions on the part of customers and governments—and this value is balanced by a high
negative potential for the firm if the data are misused. One underlying reason for not wanting CDRs not to become a public good is that this value is
linked to their scarcity. The calls for data to operate as a public good effectively highlight the fact
that it does not currently do so, and the debate highlighting CDRs’ importance to researchers and
policymakers effectively increases the status of firms as gatekeepers of high-value data. Out of the
two overarching models for data sharing—one where an intermediary holds and provides access
to multiple datasets, versus another where firms control the process of data sharing—the second
is likely to be more attractive to data proprietors because it both creates scarcity and focuses the
good publicity arising from such projects mainly on the firm. The ecosystemic characteristics of private-sector data demonstrated in this paper make it
harder for data to be shared without an idea of its eventual purpose.
