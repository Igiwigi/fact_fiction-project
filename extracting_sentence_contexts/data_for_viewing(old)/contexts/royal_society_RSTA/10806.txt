would not, however, fall on the photographic plate used by us.

The identification of the lines and bands in the visible portion of the spectrum
is much more difficult.

(1.) Lines.—Near the more refrangible end of the visible spectrum the manganese
triplet occurs, each line being very strong ; the neighbouring potassium lines \ 4044
and 4047 are also very strong. Next in order are four strong lines with wave-lengths
4171°5, 4201°9, 4216°0, and 4226-4.

These lines are not present in the Bessemer spectra from the “acid” process which
we had hitherto examined, and their identification was not readily accomplished.
The first fact noticed was that the first and last lines varied in strength independently
of all other lines in the spectra, and that of the two intermediate lines, 4201°9 was
always stronger than 4216°0. These two were, therefore, identified with rubidium, as
they were the strongest lines in the oxyhydrogen flame spectrum of that element.
The line 42264 was identified with calcium, this being decidedly the strongest line in

the oxyhydrogen flame spectrum of calcium oxide. It corresponds with a strong
Fraunhofer line (best seen in Plate No. 4).
The oxyhydrogen spectrum of rubidium is such that no further lines of this element
were expected, and none were found. In the ease of the calcium oxide, the band in
