When, however, a finer _
mathematical test was applied to Professor WxLDoNâ€™s observations as well as to
other statistical series for organs in man,* it became clear that the coefficient of
correlation varied from local race to local race, and could not be used as a criterion
of species. A slight investigation undertaken in the summer of 1896 convinced me
that the coefficient of correlation between any two organs, is just as much peculiar and
characteristic of a local race as the means and variations of those organs. In fact,
if local races be the outcome of natural selection, then their coefficients of correlation
must in general differ. The object of the present paper is to show, not only that
natural selection must determine the amount of correlation, but that it is probably
the chief factor in the production of correlation. If selection, natural or artificial,
be capable of producing correlation, then it seems impossible to regard all correlation
as evidence of a causal nexus,t although the converse proposition that all causal
nexus denotes correlation, is undoubtedly the most philosophical method of regarding
causality.
