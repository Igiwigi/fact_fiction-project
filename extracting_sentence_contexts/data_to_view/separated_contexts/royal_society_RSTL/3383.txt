More particularly, the part in question is directed
towards an attenuated region or an orifice (figs. 165. 167.), to be presently mentioned
as obseryed in the thick transparent membrane f. In one or two instances, indeed,
this part appeared as if protruded into the orifice; and I could not discern a conti-
nuation over it of the membrane of the vesicle,

332, In my © Second Series,” it was stated that I had found Spermatozoa on the
ovary||. From the facts just mentioned, and those about to be recorded, it may, I
think, be inferred that the fecundating element of the seminal fluid penetrates, not
only into the ovary, and into the interior of the oyum, but into the germinal vesicle,

pearance after maceration (** Second Series,” 7. c., Plate V. fig. 89. b.), for each of the several layers of incipient
cells into which a nucleus resolves itself, we shall hereafter find frequently to become circumscribed by a
proper membrane.

+ Resembling that figured by R. Wacxer in a very mature ovarian oyum of the Frog. (Beitrige zur Ge-
schichte der Zeugung und Entwickelung, tab. ii. fig. 6. d.).

$ R. Wacxxs remarks, with reference to the unaltered spot, that it appeared to him to be always directed
towards the surface of the oyum (Beitrige, &c., p. 24.).

|| A note was added, yielding the priority of this discovery—made, however, in another Mammal, the Dog—
to Professor Biscuore.
