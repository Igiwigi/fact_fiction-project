But sin 4a is common to
the first and second half-period, while is determined mainly by the shape of the curve near the maximum. Hence, in general, « alone varies between the first and second half-periods. It appears that the result of
varying « only in formule (15, 16) is to produce a fictitious decrease in g while the increase of s is diminished
as may be seen in Table II. For this reason mean values for the whole period are used in constructing
figs. 1 and 2.
