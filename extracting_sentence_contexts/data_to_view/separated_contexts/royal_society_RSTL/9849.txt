This belt of spindle-cells is the representative of the
claustral formation of higher Mammals, and is directed towards the surface of the
cortex below, along the inner margin of the superficial olfactory fasciculus. It forms
therefore a deep belt, dividing off the olfactory area from the external olfactory regions
(Plate 49, fig. 8, c). Having noted this fact, a horizontal section should be taken
through the hemisphere, close to its basal cortex, as was done for the examination of
the connexion of the olfactory lobe with the olfactory area. If such a section pass
through the deeper part of the superficial olfactory band we shall note that whilst its
outer fibres are long and continued uninterruptedly backwards, the innermost fasciculi

constantly tend to bend outwards #nd pass through and across the longitudinal band,
arching in fan-like manner over the whole external olfactory region as far as the limbic
