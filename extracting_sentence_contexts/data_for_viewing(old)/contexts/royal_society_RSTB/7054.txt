A great deal more work could be quoted to show the importance of the pituitary secre-
tions in the regulation of the water balance; an excellent summary of all aspects, however,
may be found in the monograph by Fisher et al. (1938). It may be stated that in spite of
many discordant views, such as those of Molitor & Pick (1924, 1925 a, b, 1926), who
emphasize the direct effect of a mid-brain centre on the tissue fluid, of Biggart (1935, 1936,
1937), who believes the pars tuberalis and centres in the tuber cinereum play an important
part in the pituitary control, and of Vasquez-Lopez (1942); who draws the assumption from
histological evidence that the neurohypophysis is a large chemo-receptor sensory organ,
the evidence is much in favour of the views of Ranson and of Verney.

One striking though hardly surprising fact is that nearly all the experimental inter-
ference with the hypophysial region has tended towards the production of lesions with a
consequent diabetic state, rather than the application of stimuli to investigate the possible
inhibition of a water diuresis. The lack of interest in this latter mode of attack is due to the
fact that the anaesthesia necessary for most methods of stimulation in itself inhibits diuresis.
Haterius (1940) is one of the few workers who has used the method of stimulation, and the
results he obtained are not altogether convincing. He studied the effects of pituitary stalk
stimulation in anaesthetized rabbits. Out of several anaesthetics tried, a solution of
chloralose and urethane given intravenously was found to exert the least depressing effect
on a water diuresis. Stimulation was performed by clamping and orientating the animal’s

head in a stereotaxic instrument, trephining a small hole at bregma, and passing fine
