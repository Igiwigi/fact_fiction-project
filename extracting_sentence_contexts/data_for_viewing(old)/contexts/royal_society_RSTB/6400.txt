cloud conditions the ratio is 146 : 54 or about 2-7 : 1.

The reality of the reduction of catches by the moon may therefore be considered
to be definitely established.

This reduction may be due to one of two effects. First may be that the
moonlight is reducing the activity of the insects, so that the active population
available to be sampled by the trap is smaller. Secondly, it is possible that the
light of the trap has to compete with the light of the moon and so is less efficient
and attracts insects from a smaller area.

It is not at present possible to distinguish between these two alternatives with
certainty, but the fact that the Noctuidae differ considerably in their response from
other insects flying at the same time suggests the effect may be partly at least
physiological.

Further investigation is proceeding to settle this point by the use of traps not
dependent on light for their attractive power. During 1935 a mechanical trap
was constructed and tested (WiLt1AMs and Minne, 1935), but while very successful
for the smaller insects it did not catch the larger Lepidoptera in any numbers.
During 1936 experiments are being started on the use of a bait trap.
