anbatinces, Penizne and isopentane, for example, give different valves for these
constants, although the two experimental carves are ulmost superposable. This is doubtless due partly to the facts —

(1) That Stovre’s formula does vot express the inue law of the temperature change
of the viseosity, and

(2) That only three observations are used in deducing the formula; but mainly to
the cireumatance

(8) That the values of » and } ave intenlependent. so that different pairs of valwes-
