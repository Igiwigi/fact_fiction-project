The diagram shows at a glance two of the most outstanding features of the rocks of
the Lesser Antilles—the abundance of lime-rich plagioclase in relatively siliceous rocks,
and the unusually small potash content. Fig. 8 also shows part of the “fields” for the
normative plagioclase of the Mexican volcanic province (Burri 1930) and of the
Tertiary and Recent volcanic rocks of the Sierra Nevada (including Lassen Peak) and
Nicaragua (Burri and Sonder 1936). The “fields” for the latter regions are very much
the same, and have been shown together.

The diagram brings out two features very clearly. The first is the much wider range
of normative plagioclase in the rocks of the American continent as compared with
those of Montserrat. This is not due to the presence of more acid rocks in the American
“fields”, for liparites and rhyolites and allied types have been excluded from the
diagram. The differences arise mainly from the fact that many of the continental
“‘dacitoides” and andesites, and many of the basalts containing a little normative
