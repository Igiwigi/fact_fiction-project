on the retina, giving for different values of > the impression of different colours ana-
logous to different musical notes in the phenomenon of sound.

To this I reply, that the phases of mazime vis viva will succeed with equal rapidity
in both cases, which is a complete answer to the objection.

In fact, if we adopt the hypothesis of a rippled front, the vis viva due to any transverse
section as it enters the pupil, will have for its expression an integral of the form

which, writing 5088 =* in the place of cos? «, and expanding each term, will give an
