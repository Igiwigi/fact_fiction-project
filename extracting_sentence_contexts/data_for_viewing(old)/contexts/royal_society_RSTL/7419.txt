and in Spiroptera obtusa, but it was found to be very thin in a species of Filaria and in

Prosthecosacter inflexus.

In transverse sections of A8caris lumbricoides or A. megalocephala, the direct continuity
and similarity of tissue between this layer and the lateral and median prominences can
be easily seen (Plate XXII1L. figs. 5 & 16). After a portion of the body has been slit

nent, the granules themselves consisting of rather large, highly refractive particles.
But a more careful inspection reveals a number of larger ovoid or spherical cells about
725" in diameter, and provided with a distinct nucleus (Plate XXII. figs. 13 & 14)
xeattered amongst the granules; and indeed it seems highly probable that most of
this granular matter is either now contained in cells, or may be considered as the
