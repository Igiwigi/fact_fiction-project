With the view of preventing the uncertainty of contact with the walls of the glass
tube, I thought at one time of trying a conductor in the form of a twisted strip,
which I had employed some years previously in experiments on the viscosity of
liquids by the Wheatstone-bridge method, for which I required a continuously
variable resistance analogous to a slide-wire in the electrical method. I found that a
round wire sliding in a tube would not do for this purpose owing to the impossibility
of centering. A twisted strip, sliding in a tube which it closely fitted, evaded this
difficulty, but led to further anomalies, which proved, on investigation by the colour-
band method, to be due to the fact that the motion of the liquid became turbulent if

the pitch of the twist was too steep. This change in the character of the flow was a
serious defect in the viscosity experiment, but was exactly what was required for the
calorimeter. As the calorimeters were already made, and I could not choose the
flow-tube to fit the strip, I procured a special pair of rolls about the end of 1897 for
rolling a wire to fit the flow-tube as closely as possible.
