It is known that the expansion of the mammalian cerebellum depends upon the
increase in cortical connections. In higher mammals this is expressed chiefly in
the growth of the lobus medius; but since the lobus anterius also enlarges
considerably, this must be due to similar causes. The Monotremes have practically
no more lobus medius than the sub-mammalia, but they have large cerebral
peduncles, a large pons, and a very large lobus anterius. The size of the lobus
anterius must be due, therefore, to the number of cortical connections, but what is
the cause of this one-sided development ?

In marsupials and other primitive mammals with a small lobus anterius the pons
is well developed but lies entirely anterior to the entering trigeminal nerve. There
is, in fact, a wide gap between the pons and corpus trapezoideum through which
the fifth nerve enters, and in which the commencement of the lateral lemniscus is
plainly visible (Sroxes, 1911). The trapezoid body is quite unencumbered by the
pons, and the sixth, seventh, and eighth nerves are attached to its superficial surface.
This condition is also found in the majority of other primitive mammals. One of
the characteristic features of the Primate brain is the caudal extension of the pons
to include the entering trigeminal nerve within its fibres. In the highest Primates
the pons even covers the corpus trapezoideum so that the six, seventh, and eighth
nerves are attached immediately against its caudal border, and their fibres pursue
a horizontal course dorsal to its posterior extension. This fact appears to have been
pointed out for the first time by Hep (1893), who regarded it as characteristic for the
chimpanzee and Man. The Edentates, whose life so closely resembles that of
Echidna, have also a marked retro-trigeminal pontine development.
