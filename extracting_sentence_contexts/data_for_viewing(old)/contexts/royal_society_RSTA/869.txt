Because of its ease of interpretation, and the fact that the analyses can be performed
based on already existing simulations, the ESR approach has been used in several publications
assessing changes in regional climate extremes at 1.5°C versus 2°C, and higher levels of global
warming [5,7].

In the present article, we use the CMIP5-based ESR analyses data processed in Wartenburger
et al. [8], based on slightly modified analyses compared to Seneviratne et al. [5] (see [8] for more
details and links to the data). The ESR-CMIP5 estimates are based on simulations from 26 Earth
system models (ESMs) with interactive ocean including up to 10 ensembles per model. Table 1
provides the list of analysed models. We compare these estimates to results from the HAPPI
experiment (see §2b). The analysed climate extreme indices are described in §2c.
