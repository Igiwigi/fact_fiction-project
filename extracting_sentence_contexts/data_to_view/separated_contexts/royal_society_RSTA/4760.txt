A central question arises here, concerning the
appropriate meaning of ‘local’ in this context. Although these issues are not yet fully resolved,
we do have the (Hausdorff) space NV defined globally, and we have a well-defined notion of local
neighbourhoods within V. In fact, assigned to each single point of PN, i.e. to each ray y in M (and therefore also to each
point I of N, providing a z-scaling for y), there is a canonically and conformally invariantly
defined flat twistor space T,,, which plays a role of a kind of ‘complex cotangent space’ to NV at
I’. This is obtained from the notions of a local twistor, and local twistor transport [2]. A local twistor
is a quantity Z% = (w“, 1), defined at a point q of the space-time M, which transforms as
