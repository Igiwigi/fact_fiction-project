tain circumstances, be very good for confining small degrees of
warmth, which would be but very indifferent when made use
of for confining a more intense heat, and vice versa. This, I
believe, is a new fact ; and, I think the knowledge of it may

lead to further discoveries relative to the causes of the warmth
of coverings, or the manner in which heat makes its passage
through them. But I forbear to enlarge upon this subject, till
I 5hall have given an account of several other experiments,
which I think throw more light upon it, and which will con-
sequently render the investigation easier and more satis-
factory. With a view to determine how far the power which certain
bodies appear to possess of confining heat, when made use of as
covering, depends upon the natures of those bodies, considered
as chymical substances, or upon the chymical principles of
which they are composed, I made the following experiments.
