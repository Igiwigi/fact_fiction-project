he found in yacuoles in the animal's skin, which seemed to be shot out when the
animal was pressed under the coyering-glass, and which were developed in glands beneath
the epithelial layer. But after more careful observation, and especially comparison of
the corresponding organs in Rhynchodemus with those of Bipalium, I came to the con-

clusion that the curiously and often spirally contorted appearance of these parent cells
was merely due to the action of spirit on a highly elastic investing membrane, and the
bodies shown in fig. 8 were merely d6bris of such a membrane. In Rhynchodemus these
cells may often be observed uncontracted and of an oval form, and containing two or
three rod-like bodies (Plate XI. fig. 2), in fact in every way resembling the rod-cells
described from ordinary aquatic Planarians. On treatment with potash, the cells of
Bipalium swell up (Plate XI. fig. 4), are seen to contain rod-like bodies, and the fine
filament at the upper extremity appears like a duct leading to the surface of the base-
ment membrane. In sections of the integument taken parallel to the surface, the parent,
cells of the rod-like bodies are seen to occupy positions opposite the interval between
the stout external longitudinal muscular fibres (Plate XI. fig. 5); and when cut
through transversely (Plate X. fig. 11), they prove to be divided into two or three com-
partments, and to be provided with a very stout horny-looking cell-wall. In vertical
sections they are usually seen to contain more than one rod-like body, often three, in
apparently different stages of development. The cells have usually a nucleus-like
body at their inferior extremity. 'The rod-like bodies and their parent glands are
Aistributed all over the body, except on the ambulacral line and the special sense-line
