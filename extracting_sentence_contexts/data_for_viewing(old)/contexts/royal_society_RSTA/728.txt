]. Introduction

Wind farms over complex terrains are still far from being fully understood as wind-turbine
wakes are expected to be affected by the terrain morphology. Despite the fact that many wind-
farm designers are aware of this effect [1], the industrial community keeps using simplified
tools such as wake models [2,3], where the velocity deficits due to the turbines’ presence are
introduced in post-processing to the flow field computed (or even measured) over the terrain
without the turbines. This approach is widely used for offshore farms with good results, while it
is questionable for onshore farms over complex terrain because the velocity deficit of the farm
might be strongly affected by the displacement of a hill, or might even have a faster decay due
to the presence of forestry, for instance. One of the strongest points of wake models is their
low computational cost, which is negligible when compared with computational fluid dynamics :
(CFD) based on Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations that take a much longer =
time. This becomes even more important when optimization of wind parks is desired and several 3
hundreds of configurations should be tested. [8
