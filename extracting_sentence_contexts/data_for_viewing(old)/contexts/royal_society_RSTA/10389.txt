SX platinum electrode are similar to those obtained using the zine electrode, except
% that at the lower potential differences the currents in hydrogen are slightly greater
8 than those in air, whereas the opposite was the case with the zinc.

2 The currents in air, hydrogen and carbon dioxide were also compared using an
A aluminium electrode. The results obtained were identical in their general character
= with those obtained using zine, though the sensitiveness of the aluminium was much
6 smaller than that of the zinc.

2 From the curves of fig. 13 we see that the currents in carbon monoxide, using a

2) zine electrode, are some 20 per cent. less than in air, being in fact almost the same
<7 as those in hydrogen until the potentials used are great enough to cause ionisation
8 by collision, which sets in in air and carbon monoxide at about the same potential
& gradient.

3 Experiments have been carried out on the photo-electric effect in certain less
4 simple gases, such as marsh gas and benzene vapour. The results obtained are
S complicated by the very large absorption of the ultra-violet light in its passage

ig through the gas, and are being further investigated.
