and Ascension ; while at Tristan d'Acunha, a detached island like the others, but re-
moved out of this medial space, the rise is eight or nine feet. This would explain also
many of the circumstances which made it s0 difficult to give any possible form to the
cotidal lines in the Atlantic ; for instance, the tide occurring nearly at the same time
all the way from the Cape of Good Hope to the Congo. This is accounted for if we
suppose that the South Atlantic is mainly occupied by the oceanic tide, and that this
area is bordered by cotida] lines nearly parallel to the shore. I must confess, how-
ever, that at present I am unable to carry this hypothesis into comparison with the
general body of the facts. Such a comparison would require obseryations much
more numerous than we as yet possess ; and, as I have already said, even with nume-
rous observations, we can only hope to draw the cotidal lines in the neighbourhood
of the shores.

18. For the same reason I shall not attempt to determine the general course of
the tides in the Pacific ; but I will remark that the view now given of the distribu-
tion of the tides in an ocean explains several of the features of the Pacific tides which
were before very perplexing. If we suppose an ocean tide from the borders of which
proceed tides having their progress marked by cotidal lines, we can easily draw the
lines 80 as to include the following facts of observation :â€”

(1.) The easterly motion of the tide-wave round Cape Horn, which is established
