Let it be remembered that there is no sign of the current |
passing when the circuit continues closed ; to produce contraction the circuit must |
be broken or closed anew. The simplest idea then which we can admit, and which
is demonstrated by experiment, is that muscular contraction is excited in every |
case by the electric park. That which might perbaps have appeared to be in oppo-
sition to the admission of this idea, is the fact of the frog contracting from very
feeble currents. It is very easy to overthrow this difficulty. In fact, I may dis-
pense with any further repetition of experiments by recalling Voura's opinion in
support.
