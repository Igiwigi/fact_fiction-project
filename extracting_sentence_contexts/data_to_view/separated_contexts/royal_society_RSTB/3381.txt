In the latter, as also in Gnetum,t
there is an inherent tendency towards a polar arrangement of its nuclei after
the division of the macrospore-nucleus (fig. 15). But if corresponding stages of
development up to the time of fertilisation are compared, the sac of Welwitschia is
probably not much larger than that of the average Angiosperm, while the number of
nuclei rapidly becomes much greater. It is therefore possible that the approximately
uniform distribution of the nuclei in the former is connected with, perhaps a direct
consequence of, the fact that after the first few nuclear divisions the sac is not large
enough to allow of any other arrangement. It has been seen that nuclei in any part of the Welwitschia-sac may remain unfused
and so retain their sexuality. If this occurs more frequently in one part of the
normally sterile region than in another it is, perhaps, at the antipodal end.
