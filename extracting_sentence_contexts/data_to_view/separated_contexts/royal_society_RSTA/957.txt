For large q-values and at the percolation regime, none of these distributions
work. We discuss the case of high-defect density next.

(b) High-defect density

When the defect density is high, one cannot treat a defect independent of the others. In fact, close
to the percolation point, where the broken bonds in the network start percolating, one cannot
pick out any single critical defect. Fracture, in this situation, is a highly cooperative process. The
critical theory and the scaling ideas of percolation phenomena can be used, at this limit, to predict
the distribution of the strength of a material.
