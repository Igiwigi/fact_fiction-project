These include atomic
force microscopy (AFM) and tissue cutting to measure forces [38-40], live ima-
ging to analyse cellular behaviours [35], and micropatterned islands to
determine how cell shape (i.e. actomyosin cytoskeletal activity) directs cell
fate [41]. However, all researchers have in common a key focus on the role of
mechanical forces in embryonic or foetal development. A key discussion topic that emerged at the meeting was the fact that the
interplay between mechanical forces and development has different meanings
for different researchers and research areas. At the largest length scale, there
are external ‘applied’ or ‘active’ forces (due to, for example, muscle activity,
fluid flow or vessel contraction) encompassing most studies of the development
of the musculoskeletal system (including [8—11,12,13] in this issue), and many
