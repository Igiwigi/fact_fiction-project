of continuum objects for achieving a complete understanding of our origin and history.

4. Conclusion

In summary, the population of small bodies in our solar system today, including both minor
planets and classical comets, is far less well-delineated into distinct groups of objects than the
classical paradigm might have led one to believe in the past. These objects instead appear to
occupy a continuum spanning the full range of observational, physical and dynamical properties
classically attributed solely either to asteroids or comets. We now know of currently actively
sublimating main-belt objects that could have originated either in the asteroid belt or in the outer
solar system, and objects displaying comet-like activity that may have no volatile ice content
whatsoever. We have found objects composed of inner-asteroid-belt-like material on long-period
comet-like orbits, and active objects on comet-like orbits that may in fact originate from the
asteroid belt. We also now recognize that dormant comets may be found in both comet-like and


un-comet-like orbits. The population of continuum objects is extraordinarily diverse, with each
type of object holding the potential for revealing exciting new insights about our solar system due
to their unique sets of overlapping comet- and asteroid-like properties. Given this complexity and
the growing interest in addressing the many questions that it has raised thus far, it is likely that
many more interesting findings await us in this rapidly developing field in the coming years.
