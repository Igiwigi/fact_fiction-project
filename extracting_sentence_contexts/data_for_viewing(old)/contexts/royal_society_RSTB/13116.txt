negative values are, at least partially, dissociable. Losses are generally
encoded by the insula, the amygdala and the dorsal prefrontal cortex,
while gains are generally encoded in the ventral prefrontal and the
striatum [31,32].

Other non-invasive imaging techniques, such as magneto- and elec-
tro-encephalography present no advantage over fMRI when it comes
to inferring single unit activity. They present better temporal resol-
ution traded off against a worst spatial resolution.

â€œThere are a few exceptions of single unit recordings in humans,
obtained from neurologic patients undergoing brain surgery. While
informative, these data are limited by the fact the neuro-anatomical
targets cannot be chosen freely and that findings may not generalize
to the general population [41].

Of course, there is a lot of information to be gained also in the case
where humans and monkeys do not display the same decisions and
biases. Such differences currently represent a strong area of research
in comparative psychology and ethology [44]. However, the (not so
implicit) assumption of the vast majority of research in neuro-econ-
omics is that monkeys are valid experimental models for human
cognition, and they are not investigated for comparative reasons.

In the human reinforcement learning literature, the most frequently
