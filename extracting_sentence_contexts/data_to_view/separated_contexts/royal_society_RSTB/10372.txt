Images from head camera video captured by 8 1/2 to 10 1/2 month-

old infants at 147 at-home mealtime events were analysed for the objects in
view. The images were found to be highly cluttered with many different
objects in view. However, the frequency distribution of object categories was

present—a fact that may substantially reduce the problem of referential ambi-

markedly from that in the training sets used in computational models and in
experiments on statistical word-referent learning. Therefore, the results also
