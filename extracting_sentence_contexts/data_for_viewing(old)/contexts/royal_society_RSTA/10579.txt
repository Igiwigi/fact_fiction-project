and longitude about 6° N. by 30° E. Thus Africa—the continent whose mean height
above sea-level is greatest—must be taken to be the centre of the “Land
Hemisphere ” in fig. 1 of my paper, while the protuberance which formed the stalk
of the pear is submerged in the Pacific Ocean, which now forms the “ Water
Hemisphere.” Almost the only remaining evidence of the existence of this
protuberance is the fact that the axis of the pear coincides with the earth’s greatest
diameter. The great circle of earthquake-centres suggested in § 38 of my paper is
to be replaced by the line of Pacific folding ; this approximately forms a small circle
(of radius about 80°) which almost coincides with the proposed great-circle in the
northern hemisphere. Further details of Professor Souuas’ view will be found in his
paper (The Figure of the Earth,” ‘Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc.,’ vol. lix., Part 2).

The fact that Africa is surrounded by a belt of seas. and this again by a belt of
land before the Pacific is reached, points perhaps to a bodily subsidence of the blunt
end of the pear, the circle of fracture having possibly been the line of Pacific folding.
Such a fracture would, of course, displace the centre of gravity of the pear, and
probably this would account not only for the feature just mentioned, but also for the
non-appearance of the protuberance. It will be noticed that the smallness of the
latitude of the extremities of the axis (6°) agrees well with the theory of planetary
evolution put forward in §§ 25-80 of the present paper. |
