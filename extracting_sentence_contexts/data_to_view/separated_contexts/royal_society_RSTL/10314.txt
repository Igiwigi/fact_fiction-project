Upon the whole, then, the plot with the straw has given somewhat more produce, a
larger percentage and actual amount of gramineous herbage, a great excess of Dactylis,
and a fair excess of a few other grasses, with a considerable deficiency of Festuca ovina. Sand several other Gramineze. The Leguminosz have been scarcely affected, but the
SMinoollanew have, upon the whole, diminished in amount, though the same species
Zare prominent as on the plot without the straw.
= The general characters and aspect of this luxuriant grassy herbage were those of
Stafted habit, broad leaves, large stems, and considerable tendency to flowering and
oding; these characters being developed in a greater degree than on the plot without
Zhe straw., The herbage, in fact, like that of plot 9, although composed of a fair propor-
Eon of grasses of good repute, was far too stemmy and coarse to constitute good hay.
i= The question obviously ariszes—what was the explanation of the marked change in
Squantity, but especially in the relative predominance, of different species, and also in
_ character of development of the herbage on plot 13, with the straw ? As already intimated, the straw contained some nitrogen, some of most of the mineral
* — Tn required, a great excess of silica, and a large amount of carbonaceous organic
Amatter ; but all of these would, presumably, become only slowly available, and con-
Sistently with this the relatively greater amount, of produce was much more manifest
Zin the later years. Tt can hardly be to the gradually available increased supplies of
Efood that the whole of the effects are to be attributed.
