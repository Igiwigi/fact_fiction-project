they bred there without giving any trouble. 'Their food consisted of Scenedesmus obliquus
and other microscopic plants, which covered the sides and bottom of the glasses with a
thin green film. Daphnia Schafferi was the species I selected, because it is the largest
of the genus, and because it could be at any time easily obtained from a pond in my
neighbourhood. This seemed to be important, because, as the species is generally found
in horseponds, I feared that my specimens would not live long in confinement. On the
contrary, however, they throve well, though in the course of a few generations they
diminished considerably in size, suggesting the idea whether they might not after all be
merely a gigantic variety of Daphnia puter. This diminution of size in animals kept in
vivaria, as compared with those living in their native haunts, is not confined to Daphniz,
nor does it appear, at least in this instance, to be caused by any injurious effect of con-
ftinement, because the specimens sceemed very healthy and multiplied freely : perhaps,
therefore, it may be connected with the known fact that insular specimens have a ten-
deney to become 8maller than continental ones of the same species.

When first taken from their native ponds, my Daphnic were generally covered with
Vorticelle, parasitic plants, &c., which materially impaired their transpareney; but I was
very glad to find that when they had been some time in captivity, they became cleaner
and more transparent, and that this was especially the case with those which, for the
