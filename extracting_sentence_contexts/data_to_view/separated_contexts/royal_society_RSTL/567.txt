But this opinion,
(founded upon very strong presumptive evidence,) although
generally adopted, is however questioned by some persons ; and
I shall therefore bring forward a few additional facts, which
will, I flatter myself, contribute to demonstrate, that bitumen
has been, and is actually and immediately formed, from the
resin, and perhaps from some of the other juices of vegetables,

The chemical characters of the pure or unmixed bitumens,
Such as naptha, petroleum, mineral tar, and asphaltum, are, in
certain respects, s0 different from those of the resins and other
inspissated juices of recent vegetables, that, had the former never
occurred but in a separate and unmixed tate, no positive in-
ference could have been drawn from their properties, in proof of
their vegetable origin. Fortunately, however, they have been
'more frequently found under circumstances which have strongly
indicated the source from whence they have been derived; and
much information has been acquired {rom observations made


388 Mr. HarcnuertT's Observations on the Change

on the varieties of turf, bituminous wood, and pit coal, on the
-nature of their surrounding strata, on the vestiges of animal
and vegetable bodies which accompany them, and on various
other local facts; all of which tend considerably to elucidate the
history of their formation, and to throw light upon this interest-
ing part of geology. Some instances have already been mentioned, which show
that fossil animal substances form a series, commencing with
Such as are scarcely different from those which are recent, and
terminating in productions which have totally lost all traces of
organization. Similar instances are afforded by the vegetable kingdom; but,
without entering into a minute detail of every gradation, I shall
only cite three examples in this island, namely,
