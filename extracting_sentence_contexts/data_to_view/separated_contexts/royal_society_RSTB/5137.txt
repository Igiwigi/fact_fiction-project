Several traces in various stages of
formation were figured in my earlier paper.t In the present material the best preserved
trace is the one shown in Plate 5, figs. 32, 33, where an earlier stage in the formation
of a pinna-trace is seen. A later stage is represented in Plate 5, fig. 36. It is a curious
fact that while pinna-traces have frequently been seen, no pinnz have yet been found ;
nor have any pinna-traces been observed detached from the petiolar bundle. The Aphlebie.â€”Very little was previously known of these organs in C. australis
and several points concerning them are still obscure. It seems fairly certain that they
are the proximal homologues of the pinne, for their relation to the primary rachis
and probably also the mode of origin of their vascular supply are essentially the same.
