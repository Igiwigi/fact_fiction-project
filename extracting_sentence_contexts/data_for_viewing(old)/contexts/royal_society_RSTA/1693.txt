previously discussed. The variation of the shock speed during the acceleration process, as shown
in figure 4, may also play a role. Besides the average energy, also the Ht cutoff energy and the


number of ions reflected by the shock increase with the laser intensity. If a beam with higher
charge is desirable, protons with energies >> 30 MeV will not be stopped in the core and therefore
their energy will not contribute to the ignition. For the highest ap considered here, despite losing
some charge, we estimate that the number of ions with energy between 9 and 30 MeV will be
sufficient to create the ‘hot spot’. The ion maximum energy is always higher than predicted by
the CSA model. The latter is derived considering cold ions with no thermal spread. At shock
formation time, our simulations show that the upstream ions have a certain thermal distribution,
which will be maintained after reflection. An ion with velocity vo, different from 0, will thus
acquire a velocity 2v; + vg upon reflection. This will result in the fact that a few ions have higher
energies with respect to the theoretical model.

3. Summary

We presented two-dimensional PIC simulations modelling the interaction of a near-infrared
intense laser pulse with the ICF corona plasma. A hole-boring driven shock is generated around
the critical density. The collisionless shock travels through the exponentially increasing plasma
gradient and reflects both hydrogen and carbon ions. As a result, a hydrogen ion beam with
average energy of 8 MeV and energy spread of 46% is generated. Ions with such energies will be
able to penetrate the dense core and deposit their energy there. The approach could thus represent
a valid alternative to achieve ion fast ignition. Indeed our simulations indicate that an adequate
amount of protons could be accelerated by the shock, depending on the laser waist size. Since
