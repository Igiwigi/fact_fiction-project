1903), the ovaries being removed from one to six days after the occurrence ot
copulation, The animals were subsequently killed, when it was found that the
extirpation of the ovaries had prevented the fixation of the ova. In further
experiments the corpora lutea are described as having been removed by being burnt
out with the galvano-cautery without destroying the rest of the ovaries, and in these
cases the result was similar. Control experiments were performed by removing one
ovary but not the other, and by destroying some of the corpora lutea, but not all, and
in the majority of instances the animals brought forth young. The results of these
experiments therefore support the view that there is an intimate connection between
the presence of the corpus luteum and the occurrence of pregnancy, and that this
connection in a certain sense is one of cause and effect.

Apart from the experimental evidence, FRAENKEL adduces certain other facts
which tend to support his theory. He points out that the general structure of the
corpus luteum is suggestive of its being a ductless gland, that it is formed mainly of
large epithelioid cells arranged in regular rows or columns not unlike those of the
cortex of the supra-renal body and surrounded by a network of capillaries, and that
its inerease in size until it becomes bigger than a mature follicle, is otherwise
inexplicable. This increase, he shows, is out of all proportion to that of the rest of the
ovary, and when the corpus luteum is most hyperemic, the other part of the ovary is
unusually anzemic, while towards the close of pregnancy, when increase in the blood
supply to the generative organs is at its highest, the corpus luteum is frequently
reduced toascar. FRAENKEL also lays some stress on the fact that it has been shown
that the lutein cells are derived from the follicular epithelium and not from the
connective tissue of the theca wall (Soporra, 1896, etc.). He points out further, that
