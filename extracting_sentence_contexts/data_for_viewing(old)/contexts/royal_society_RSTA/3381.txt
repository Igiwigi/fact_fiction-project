so large objects with repeating substructures may have lower complexity than smaller objects
with greater heterogeneity. In addition, the history dependence and recursive nature of the
measure mean that internal symmetries are also accounted for if they lie on the shortest pathway.
For example, an object may be asymmetric but have a symmetric feature in it that can be
constructed through duplication prior to the asymmetric parts being added on. Those duplicated
structures may themselves contain substructures with similar duplications, which are accounted
for recursively. In this way, we can describe the construction of structures through repeated
duplication and addition of subunits.

Pathway Complexity has an upper bound of Ny â€” 1, where Ny is the number of vertices on the
graph. This represents joining two fundamental graphs in the first step, and then adding one more
ata time until the object is constructed. One lower bound of Pathway Complexity is logy Ny, which
represents the fact that the simplest way to increase the size of an object in a pathway is to take the
largest object so far and join it to itself, e.g. we can make an object of size 2 with one join, 4 with
2 joins, 8 with 3 joins, etc. An illustration of the upper and lower bounds of Pathway Complexity
can be seen in figure 4, with the orange regions being forbidden due to the above boundary
conditions. The green portion of the figure is illustrative of the location in the complexity space
where life might reasonably be found. Regions below can be thought of as being potentially
naturally occurring, and regions above being so complex that even living systems might have
