26 and 27). J. P. HILL ON THE DEVELOPMENTAL HISTORY OF THE PRIMATES. 65

It might be held that these cells are the last remnants of former proliferative activity
on the part of the trophoblast, but the fact that they appear to be produced by the
division of a parent trophoblast cell tangentially to the surface, instead of radially
thereto, as is normal, suggests that they are to be regarded simply as the products of
accidental deviations from the normal mitotic plane. Apart from these cells, we have not observed in the development of the placenta of
Loris any structural feature which in the slightest degree suggests its derivation from a
more complicated type. Turning to the opposite view that the Lemuroid placenta is essentially primitive,
what evidence, apart from theoretical considerations, can we adduce in its support ?

Earlier in this lecture (ante, p. 60) we have expressed our conviction that certain
events in the development of the Lemur, viz., the relatively early establishment of the
chorion and its precocious and direct vascularization by way of the allantois as soon
as that had fused with a localised area of its inner surface, were of the greatest phyletic
significance, since they paved the way for the still more precocious differentiation of
the chorion and the connecting stalk which is such a characteristic feature in the
development of Tarsius and the higher Primates.
