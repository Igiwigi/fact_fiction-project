a yariable scale; and in making the experiment, I found that at an incidence
of 25Â®, when the divisions of 5000 in an inch were employed, the coloured
images of the laminz corresponded with those of the grooved steel. Hence
the value of the quantity B, or the breadth of the fibres, is about the 5500dth
part of an inch.

I next detached laminz from parts nearer the pole, and I found that the
coloured images gradually separated as the fibres approached to the poles;
thus proving, what might have been inferred from other facts, that the fibres
gradually taper in breadth from the equator to the poles of the lens. In order
to allow the fibres to be packed without condensation into spherical lamine,
their breadths must diminish as the cosine of the distance from the equator.

Although the prolate form of the spheroid indicates that the thickness of the
laminze, or of their component fibres, must increase slightly towards the poles,
yet I have not been able to prove this experimentally, or even to determine
the thickness of the fibres. I have more than once detached, by accident, a
single fibre from the mass, and by an examination of the black line which
forms its edges, I am satisfied that its thickness is at least five times less than
its maximum breadth.
