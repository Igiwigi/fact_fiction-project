18, 19. The abdominal ganglia,

The ganglia are separated from one another by portions of the cords absolutely
unconnected by transverse commissural fibres.

In the inter-ganglionic regions each cord is rather rounded in transverse section
(fig. 1.), and free from the ectoderm, but as the ganglia are approached a continually
closer connection with the ectoderm obtains. In its free or inter-ganglionic part a
delicate sheath with small deeply staining nuclei invests the cord. Passing from
the middle region towards the ganglion above or below, nerve cells become more
numerous, always immediately underlying the investing sheath. One striking fact
thus becomes evident in this primitive nervous system, namely, that there is no sharp
line of demarcation between ganglionic and inter-ganglionic, or strictly conducting
regions. Further, the fibrous core in this latter region is seen in longitudinal sections
to consist of longitudinally arranged fibres which stain well with carmine stains.
Connecting these, however, in many cases are more delicate filaments which run
