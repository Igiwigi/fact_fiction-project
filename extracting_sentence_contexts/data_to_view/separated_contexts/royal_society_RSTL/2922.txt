MR. WHEATSTONE ON THE PHYSIOLOGY OF VISION. 878

obviously dissimilar pictures on the two retinze when a single object is viewed, while
the optic axes converge, must therefore be regarded as a new fact in the theory of
vision.

2. It being thus established that the mind perceives an object of three dimensions by
means of the two dissimilar pictures projected by it on the two retin, the following
question occurs: What would be the visual effect of simultaneously presenting to each
eye, instead of the object itself, its projection on a plane surface as it appears to that
eye? To pursue this inquiry it is necessary that means should be contrived to make
the two pictures, which must necessarily occupy different places, fall on similar parts
of both retinze.
