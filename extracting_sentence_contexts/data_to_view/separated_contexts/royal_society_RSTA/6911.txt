The evidence has recently been reviewed by King (1949), who confirms this
general structure and shows that in mid-Channel the depth of sediment may well be 4000
to 6000 ft. This would more than suffice to account for the observed anomalies. The fact
that even larger anomalies are not found indicates that either the density of the sedi-
mentary rocks is greater than 2-2 or that some degree of isostatic compensation has taken
place. Both are quite probable. A gravity survey of this area has now been carried out in
H.M.
