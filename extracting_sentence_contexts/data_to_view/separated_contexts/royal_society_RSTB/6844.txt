(Italics de Beerâ€™s.) It is clear therefore that there are no reliable grounds on which the independence
of the palatine processes in mammals can be asserted. Again, in early papers much weight was placed on the fact that the vomer of
Ornithorhynchus ossified from a single centre by comparing it with typical parasphenoids. The use of this argument was destroyed utterly when it was shown that the vomer
of the allied Echidna ossified from two centres, particularly since this occurs also in
other mammals (man, pig). Yet the argument has since been reversed and a double
origin used as evidence in favour of the prevomer-vomer homology.
