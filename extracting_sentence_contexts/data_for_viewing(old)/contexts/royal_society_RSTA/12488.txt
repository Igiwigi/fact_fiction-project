The difficulties in the way of obtaining this gas in a sufficiently pure state proved
so great, that what can only be considered as qualitative results have been obtained
from the experiments up to the present. It is true that as the procedure of gene-
rating and storing the gas was refined upon, results closely agreeing with the
theoretical value of the specific heat were obtained, but always so far differing from
each other as to show some difference in the purity of the samples of gas dealt with.
It has, hence, been impossible to assign with certainty a definite experimental value
to the specific heat.

The earlier experiments are rejected as having been effected on very impure
hydrogen, affording values entirely too low. A very small impurity by volume will
seriously affect the result of experiment. The error due to an admixture with
another gas is, in fact, very nearly proportional to the percentage of impurity by
weight.

The hydrogen was generated from granulated distilled zinc, under the action of
dilute “pure” sulphuric acid. It was purified, in the case of the immediately
succeeding experiments, by passing it through a tube containing pumice and a
solution of silver nitrate, and then dried by passage through a tube containing
sulphuric acid on pumice, and three tubes of phosphoric anhydride, passing through a
fourth tube of the same nature between receiver and sphere. From the generating
bottle it passed into a glass gas-holder under a head of about half a metre of water
for the supply of the pump.

At the conclusion of the Series I. a portion was allowed to escape and a second series
