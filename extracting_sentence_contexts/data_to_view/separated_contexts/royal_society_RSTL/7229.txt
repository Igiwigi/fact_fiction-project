He rests his opinion upon the fact that in fine transverg
Sections which he has made of the median lines, he has found them perforated length
wise by cavities having an elliptical or oval cross section; which tubes or cavities, bv
sates, are invariably filled with a transparent, homogeneous s8ubstance of a reddish 9
yellowish tint. He says that from 8ix to eight 8uch bodies can be detected in thi
ventral median line of A. megalocephala, but only from four to six in the dorsal. Thea
are considered to be transverse sections of nerve-fibres; but the fact that they have *
distinctly larger diameter than the principal nerve-fibres issuing from the ganglion-celk
seems to me s8trongly opposed to this view. I have myself been unable to recogniz
such structures in the median lines, 80 must refer for further details concerning them to
Dr. ScaxzDER's important memoir.
