Obserya-
tions taken hourly at the Madras Observatory, every tenth day and night, make the
night tide from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m. to amount to *035, and the 4 a.m. to 10 A.M. tide to
be -047 ; the other two tides being respectively 079 and 063. The smallness of this
maximum diurnal tide appears very anomalous, considering that Madras is in a low
latitude and at the level of the sea. In opposition to the above facts, Dr. RussELL, at Boorhanpoor, gives a nocturnal
minimum tide with a contrary sign, or a rise instead of a Fall of +0200, between 10 p.m.
and 5 A.m.; and in observations of Dr. RoyLs, at Saharunpoor in India, at 1000
feet above the sea, and of Fray Juan, at Vera Cruz, the nocturnal tide appears
in the monthly means 8 often with a plus instead of a minus 8ign, that the annual
mean establishes this tide only by 001 at Saharunpoor, and by :002 at Vera Cruz.
