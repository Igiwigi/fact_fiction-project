It has been the custom to record the intensities of spectrum lines on an arbitrary
scale, ranging generally from 10 for the strongest lines to 1 or 0 for the weakest. The intensities have usually been assigned purely at the discretion of the observer,
and without much regard to the conditions of observation, whether visual or
photographic. In any case, the apparent intensities are affected by the optical
system by means of which the spectrum is produced, and whereas in visual
observations the sensitiveness of the eye to different wave-lengths should be taken
into account, matters are even more complicated in the case of photographs of spectra,
where the sensibility of the photographic plate varies very considerably with the
wave-length in a manner which is not precisely defined, and which appears in fact to
be toa great extent irregular. These remarks apply to the visible and ultra-violet
regions of the spectrum. Measurements in the infra-red are usually carried out with
the thermopile or bolometer, and in this case quantitative measurements of the
intensities of lines are obtained.
