The
developing egg-cells, however, did not in any of these examples attain a greater size
than 0°2 x 0°07 mm., and were thus smaller than the largest ova found either in the
winged females or the soldiers. In the second stage nymphs, the gonads and egg-cells
had attained slightly larger dimensions.

(e) Worker-like Forms.—Eleven worker-like females were dissected with special
reference to the gonads. The latter (Plate 8, fig. 47) do not differ from those of the
winged female, except that in several specimens they were considerably larger, owing
probably to the fact that the individuals dissected were nearer sexual maturity than
the latter. In length each ovary varied from 2°5 to 5 mm., the oviduct averaged
1 mm., and the number of ovarioles varied from about 32 to 48. Eggs attaining a
length of 0°05 mm., and over, in most cases had their follicles evident; in several
instances the longest eggs attained a measurement 10-48 mm., thus exceeding in
size any found in the winged females.
