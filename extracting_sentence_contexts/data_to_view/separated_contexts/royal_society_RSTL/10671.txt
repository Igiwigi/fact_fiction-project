For example, in sec. 100 the only self-corre-

gpondence of a, b, c, is given by the constituent = = and here no correspondence

of the undistinguished units Â«, b oceurs,

121. When invyestigating the correspondences of a number of (7 + m)-ads we
may for s0me time be vecupied with the consideration of correspondences in which
m of the units always remain identically-correspondent. The absence of change
in the correspondence of the m-units may lead us to forget or overlook the fact that
we are considering correspondences of the (7 + 3)-ads, and we may suppose that we
are dealing with n-ads only, When then we find that a certain correspondence of
two n-ads apparently does not exist, we must look closely to see whether we are
nob really considering correspondences of (7 + m)-ads, and whether a change in the
correspondence of the m units may not lead to the correspondence of the n which
is supposed not to exist.

122, Units which in any correspondence of two undistinguished aspects are
identically-correspondent may be termed the foci of the correspondence. Three or
more undistinguished aspects such that the foci of the correspondences are the same
in the case of each pair, may be said to be confocal. We may also use the term
confocal as applicable to the case of corresponding components of the corresponding
confocal aspects.

123, In cases in which, as mentioned in sec. 121, we consider (7 + m)-ads as if they
were n-ads, we really pass from the consideration of the original units to that of
other units which are arrived at by taking the m foci with each of the other units
guccessively, and then regarding the resulting (m + 1)-ads as single units.
