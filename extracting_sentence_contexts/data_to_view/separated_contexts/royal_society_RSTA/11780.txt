from the readings of the thermometer placed in it. Recent results of Kane agree
with our conclusions, and show that, in the H form of cell, the lag in the change of
the electromotive force with change of temperature is avoided, owing to the fact that
the liquid at both electrodes, being in contact with crystals of zine sulphate, is always
in a state of concentration. We have, after the conclusion of our experiments, set up
a few cells according to the instructions given in the Third Memorandum of the
Board of Trade. When proper precautions are taken to ensure equality of tempera-
ture, these cells agree within about one part in ten thousand with each other and
our standard cell.
