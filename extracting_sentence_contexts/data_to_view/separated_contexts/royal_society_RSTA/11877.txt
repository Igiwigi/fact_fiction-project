Crookes, who a short time ago called attention to the flame rising from platinum
‘terminals, which convey a high tension alternating electric discharge, and pointed
out its dependence upon combustion of the nitrogen and oxygen of the air.*
Mr. Crookes was kind enough to arrange an impromptu demonstration at his own
house with a small alternating current plant, in which it appeared that the absorp-
tion of mixed gas was at the rate of 500 cub, centims. per hour, or nearly 20 times
as fast as with the battery. The arrangement is similar to that first described by
Srorriswoopr.t The primary of a RuumKorrr coil is connected directly with the
alternator, no break or condenser being required; so that, in fact, the coil acts
Simply as a high potential transformer. When the arc is established the platinum
Serminals may be separated much beyond the initial striking distance.
