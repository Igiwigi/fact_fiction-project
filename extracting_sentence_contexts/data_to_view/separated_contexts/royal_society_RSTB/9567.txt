Mapping these T6SS-
dependent immunity proteins helps to identify cognate
effectors that are usually located in the same operon [92]. This approach is, however, limited to effectors that have
exactly one cognate immunity protein targeted into the
periplasm of the effector cell. Another interesting mass spectrometry method was
based on the fact that some Hcp-binding effectors are less
stable in the absence of Hep [88,93]. An advantage of this
method is that proteins that are active in the cytosol or are
not necessarily toxic against bacteria can be detected, but
only in the case of their inherent instability in the absence
of Hep [93]. Bioinformatics has proved to be a useful approach for
finding new effectors for various secretion systems including
T6SS [94].
