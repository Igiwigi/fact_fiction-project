Þ] 4AM desirous of submitting to the Royal Society some observations on the
nature of what are termed Negative and Imaginary Quantities, tending as I
hope to clear away the obscurity that has hitherto surrounded them. The subject has occupied my attention for many years, and however plain
and simple may be the results, they haye not been obtained without much
patient investigation ; and, in the eyent of their being found correct, they will
add one authority more to an obseryation frequently made, and confirmed by
extensive experience, —That paradoxes and apparent solecisms, involving them-
selyes with facts or with deductions known to be true, may always be found
near the surface, owing their existence either to ambiguities of expression or
to the unperceived adoption of some extraneous additions or limitations into
the compound terms used for definition, which are subsequently taken as con-
stituent parts of their essence. The first misapprehension appears to consist in our considering any quan-
tity whatever as negative per se, and without reference to another opposed to
it, which has previously been established as positive. In applying our arithmetic to whatever is continuous, some neutral point or
zero must be selected, as in time, in space with reference to its three dimen-
sions, in forces, in velocities; and the opposite directions from this point will
be mutually negative in respect to each other, and must be distinguished by
appropriate marks or signs.
