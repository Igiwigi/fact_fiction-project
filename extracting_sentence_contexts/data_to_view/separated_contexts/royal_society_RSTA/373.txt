Ideally, geoengineering wedges might be biased towards the carbon side of

1e equation [1,8]. Removing CO, also helps directly mitigate ocean acidification
9] and its potential marine ecological impacts, and is addressing the cause rather
1an simply the consequence of greenhouse gas emissions. Geoengineering is no longer the realm of science fiction, with key technologies
necessary to make some of the schemes work emerging and understanding
of climate impacts improving. Geoengineering represents a new wave in a
process through which human society has been progressively changing the
albedo and hydrology of the land surface for thousands of years as agriculture
1as developed and the population urbanized, and more recently, changing the
greenhouse composition of the atmosphere and chemistry of the ocean as societies
1ave industrialized. The manipulation of global climate by alternating both
surface short-wave budgets and atmospheric long-wave radiation budgets is
1ence not an alien activity to us.
