They are based on the ‘amalgamation’ idea. Based on a
sample of gene trees, amalgamation is a dynamic program-
ming algorithm that allows the exhaustive exploration of a
large space of gene trees. In fact, based on a limited set of
gene trees, amalgamation allows consideration of a much
larger space of gene trees, because it can piece together
clades from several trees at a time to generate new trees,
not present in the initial sample of gene trees. This technique
is found to improve on competing approaches [16,23] in both
speed and accuracy. Probabilistic gene tree-aware approaches can also be used
to date trees.
