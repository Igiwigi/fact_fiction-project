[35]. This gene, which is a member of a large transcription
factor family, is specifically expressed in developing hair
and teeth, and is a regulator of ectodermal development
[32], making it a superb candidate for the trait [35]. The
underlying mutation is a 7 bp duplication in exon 1 of the
gene, yielding a frameshift that produces a premature stop
codon and loss of 95% of the normal protein. In addition to
the Chinese crested, the Xolo and Peruvian Hairless Dog
carry the same mutation [35]. The lack of homozygotes in
either breed suggests that the mutation is embryonic lethal,
perhaps due to other functions of the gene.

The fact that these hairless breeds all share the exact
mutation is not surprising despite their reportedly diverse
origins. As a dominant trait the novel hairless phenotype
would have been easy to perpetuate in any breed in which
it was crossed. There is little verified history of the breeds
independently, as both the Chinese and the South American
dogs have been reported to be in the Americas prior to Euro-
pean colonization [36]. Whether this is an indication of early
trade between Asia and the new world, prehistoric migration
from Asia across the Bering Strait, or a lack of distinction
between the breeds in early days is unknown. The Xolo pur-
portedly existed in Mexico at least since the time of the Aztecs
and were at one time considered sacred, as the dogs were
