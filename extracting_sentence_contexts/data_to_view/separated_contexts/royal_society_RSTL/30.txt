That after very great ſtormes of Wind, when the

Quickſilver has been low, it generally riſes again very faſt, -
"That the more Northerly places have greater altera-
tions of the Buroſcope than the more Southerly.

$. That within the -Tropicks and near them, thoſe ac-
counts wee have had from others, and my own Oblervati-
on at St. Helena make very little or no variation of the *
hight of the Mercury in all weathers : Now that Theory that
can well account for all theſe Appearances, will in all pro-
Þability approach nearer the true Cauſe of the Barometers
variations, than any thing hitherto offered ; and fuch-an
one am bold to believe, is that which I here lay down,
with ſubmiſſion to better Judgments. I conceive that the principal Cauſe of the riſe and fall of
the Mercury, is from the Variable Winds, which are found
; in the Temperate Zones, and whoſe great unconſtancy here
in England is moſt notorious : I ſhall not at preſent inquire
into the Cauſe of its uncertainty, but the matter of FaCt be-
ing moſt undoubted, the Legitimate Conſequences thereof
muſt be allowed me; let it proceed from what it will,

A Second Cauſe is the uncertain Exhalation and Prz-
cipitation of the Vapours, lodging in the Air, whereby it
comes to be at one time much more crouded, than at ano-
ther, and conſequently heavier; but this latter ina great mea-
ſure depends upon the former. Now from theſe Principles,
T ſhall endeavour to Explicate the ſeveral Phenomena of the
Barometer, taking them in the ſame. Order, I layd them

own.
