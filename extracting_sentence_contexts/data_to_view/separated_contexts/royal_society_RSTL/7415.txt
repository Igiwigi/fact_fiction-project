It would seem that the viscid layer does not entirely prevent the absorption of
watery s0lutions of pigments into the substance of the yelk-sac. This does not, however,
invalidate the conclusion as to the mode in which water enters to form the breathing-
chamber. That it is the inner sac which presents the obstacle to the imbibition of
aqueous s0Jutions of colouring-matter into the yelk, is shown by the fact that eggs which
have lain for forty-eight hours in the dead body of the parent, and have become slightly
decomposed, permit the tint of the caramel, and of iron when tested by prussiate of
potash, to appear in the substance of the yelk, in such of them only as have the inner
sac ruptured, a change which often occurs in dead eggs, and will be again referred to.

b. Concentration of the formative yelk.â€”Very s0on after the funnel of the micropyle
begins to shorten, the formative yelk commences to undergo the series of changes which
eventually terminate in the formation of the germinal disk. In one instance, where the spermatozooid was seen to enter, the yellow droplets were
distinctly paler in 13 minute, and an obscure puckering was visible at the same time
on the surface of the discus proligerus, which, after the completion of the act of feeun-
dation, I would call the germinal disk.
