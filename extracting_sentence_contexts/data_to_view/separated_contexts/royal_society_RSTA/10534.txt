That some such thing as this does really occur in practice
is very well shown by the results published by Unwin (‘The Testing of Materials of


CIRCULAR CYLINDERS UNDER CERTAIN PRACTICAL SYSTEMS OF LOAD, 221

Construction’), where blocks show less strength when three sheets of lead are
introduced between the compressing planes and the test piece than when one sheet
only is introduced, the lateral flow being greater in the first case owing to the larger
amount of lead. Tt would seem, therefore, as if the true strength of a cylinder were really greater
than its strength as tested either between millboards or between lead sheets, and
not, as Professor Perry states in his ‘Applied Mechanies,’ equal to the strength
shown in the lead test—this test, as we see, leading to results that are not definite,
but vary with the expansion of the lead. The millboard test, however, which is
advocated by Unwin, should give a constant value, although it is not the value which
would hold for a cylinder under uniform pressure.

(d.) Diagrams 12-14 suggest an explanation of the fact that, when short cylinders
are strongly compressed between very hard surfaces, pieces are sometimes cut out at
the ends of an approximately conical shape. The same occurs when spherical pieces
of metal, such as ball-bearings, are compressed between parallel plates. This is usually
explained by saying that the material breaks along the planes of principal shear.
