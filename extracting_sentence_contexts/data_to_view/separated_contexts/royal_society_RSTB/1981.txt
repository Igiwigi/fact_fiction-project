A plant with a tuber or
bulb in which to store carbohydrates, may rarely have sufficient concentration of
sugar in the leaf to necessitate starch deposition there, while a plant without such an
organ must store the excess in the mesophyll. Another question to which particular attention has been paid in the examination
of monocotyledonous leaves is how far the age of the leaf has anything to do with its
capacity for forming starch. No conclusive evidence has been obtained on this point,
but certain facts suggest the idea that in some Monocotyledons at least the power of
the chloroplasts to elaborate starch diminishes as the age of the leaf increases ;
eg., the cases of Uvularia grandiflora, Lilium tigrinum, Alstremeria aurea, Iris
plicata and I, Xiphium and Avena sativa, Allium Cepa also contains starch in its
young state, but not afterwards. Section 3.â€”THe Srarcu or tHE Sromata, Guarp-CExts. Sacus* pointed out that the guard-cells still contain starch after the rest of the
leaf is depleted, and mentioned Tropeolum as containing starch in its stomata after
48 hours in the dark.
