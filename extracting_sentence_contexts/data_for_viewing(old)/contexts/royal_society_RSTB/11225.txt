Xist RNA (or a short isoform of Xist RNA, RepA) directly, via the A-repeat,
an element at the 5’ end of the transcript that is critical for Xist mediated
chromosome silencing [11]. This finding, based largely on in vitro interaction
studies, established a model in which Polycomb recruitment to Xi is initiated
