The ratio between the two
time steps, depending on the LBM lattice spacing and the DSMC particle characteristic collision
time, defines the number of subcycles the DSMC should run for each LBM time step. The LBM
solution information in proximity of the fine level grid is passed to the DSMC via the imposition
of proper boundary conditions on the particle simulation domain. At the beginning of each DSMC
integration step, in fact, particles are generated within the buffer region by sampling Grad’s
distribution built according to the reconstruction step. The particles, in both the DSMC and the
buffer regions, are allowed to stream for one fine level time step. If a particle from the DSMC
region crosses the interface, that particle will contribute to the fluxes of mass and momentum for
the LBM discrete distributions corresponding to the node where the crossing occurred, so that the


populations will be corrected as

R

i=1
where f; are the populations before the application of the correction, R is the ratio between the
LBM and DSMC time-step durations, and the correction contribution, }°; Afa, can be evaluated
from equation (2.1) for n > 1 (only the fluxes are exchanged).
