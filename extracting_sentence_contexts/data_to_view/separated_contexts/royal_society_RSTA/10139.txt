Definition.—The nonsecant part of u is that subclass of uw of which no
member is a member of any interpoint which is a subclass of vu. The nonsecant part
of u is denoted by nscx,‘u. The symbolic definition is

nscpu = e{veu. — (qv). veintpnt,, n cls‘u . rev} Df

Note.—This definition takes its importance from the fact that (assuming the
subsequent axioms) a point in general consists of a nonsecant part and of a part
made up of interpoints contained in it. Either the interpoints or the nonsecant
part may be wholly absent.

*20°232, Definition.—A class of points is called a Figure.
