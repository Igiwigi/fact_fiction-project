Z cipitates were more like each other, still the obstinacy with
S which titanium refuses to unite with the fixed alkalis, and the
3 insolubility of it in acids when heated, sufficiently denote the
5: different nature of these two substances.

So. The iron in the ore which has been examined, is apparently
= in the same state as it is in wolfram, viz. brown oxide; and
S this oxide is mineralised by the metallic acid which has been

7 ganese are mineralised by the tungstic acid or rather oxide.
Z For, from several experiments made upon a large scale, I have
E: reason to believe that in wolfram, the tungsten has not attained
Z the maximum of oxidation, Several facts in the course of the
= experiments lately described, seem to prove, that this new metal
E differs from tungsten and the other acidifiable metals, by a more
E limited extent of oxidation; for, unlike these, it seems to be
a incapable of retaining oxygen sufficient to enable the total

quantity to combine with the fixed alkalis. In $ II. G. 2, this
is very evident; for, from the experiment there described it
appears, that when the metallic acid or oxide was digested with
lixivium of potash, only a part was dissolved; and that the re-
mainder was insoluble in the same lixivium, till it had received
