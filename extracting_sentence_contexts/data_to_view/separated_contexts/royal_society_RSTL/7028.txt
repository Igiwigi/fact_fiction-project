After which
Mr. Canton immediately exhibited the main experi-
ment itſelf, as deſcribed-in his paper, together with
ſome others : all which ſucceeded greatly to the fatiſ-
fafion of the company. But as he feared himſelf,
that he ſhould not be able, by reaſon of the concern
he was under in the preſence of ſo many worthy
perſons, and for whom he had ſo great a reſpedt,

either [33]

either to make his experiments to ſo good an adyan-
tage, as they might otherwiſe be made, or to give to
his bars the ſame degree of ſtrength, which he had
formerly and frequently given to others of the ſame
ſort he was therefore deſirous to refer himſelf for
ſuch particulars, to what the preſident of the Society
had already ſeen and taken minutes of, a few days
before; and who thereupon reported, as he faid he
could faithfully do, to the beſt of his judgment and
obſervation, the following facts :

That having been in company with Mr. John
Ellicot, of the Society, at Mr, Canton's houſe in
Spital-ſquare, Biſhopſgate-ſtreet ; he had there ſeen
him communicate the magnetic virtue, in the manner
deſcribed in his paper, to ſix bars of the dimenſions
therein mention'd, and weighing, one with another,
about an ounce and three quarters each, Troy weight. That theſe bars were at firſt perfectly indifferent as to
either end of a compals needle, but that they did any
of them, after their impregnation, lift by one of their
ends, ſtrongly and diſtin&ly, full twenty-eight troy
ounces; the whole operation of giving them their
virtue having taken up nearly thirty minutes,

That Mr. Canton had beſides ſhewn him at the
ſame time two larger bars, each half an inch ſquare,
ten inches and an half in length, and weighing nearly
ten ounces and twelve penyweight : and that theſe, as
he was informed, had been, mutatis mutandis, impreg-. nated in the fame manner as the former.
