As remarked in [75], if uq converges strongly in L? to some u, then the latter would be a weak
solution of incompressible Euler which satisfies the local energy inequality

3This is in fact not fully correct since the proof of theorem 3.5 does not achieve the threshold } but rather gets ¢ close to it for
every positive e.


This suggests a stronger form of the Onsager conjecture, where the dissipative solution is required
to satisfy (3.27). The first such examples in the literature were given in [22], but the solutions in
[22] were only bounded. Hélder weak solutions were first constructed by Isett [76] and the Hélder
regularity found in [76] has been later improved in [77], but these results are still relatively far
from the ; threshold.

4. Conclusion

In this note, we surveyed several results in the mathematical literature. First of all we highlighted
