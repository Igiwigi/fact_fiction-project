?Counterfactual reasoning is a wide-ranging interdisciplinary
research area. While some researchers use the term ‘counterfactual
reasoning’ to refer to any reasoning about alternative representations
that conflict with actual representations of reality, others use the term
to refer specifically to reasoning about nearest possible alternatives to
past events (see e.g. [7,8] for some discussion). In this work, we use
the broader definition of counterfactual reasoning, meaning any
reasoning about alternatives that conflict with reality.

“These questions required children to reason about the future effects
of present counterfactual identities, in contrast with some previous
work which has asked children to reason about the effect of counter-
factual past actions on present events.

“The counterfactual effects and pretend effects questions directly par-
allel each other—one asks about the counterfactual causal effect of
the block given a counterfactual identity, and one asks about the pre-
tend causal effect of the block given a pretend identity. Therefore, as
in [14], we focus our analyses on pretend effects performance. How-
ever, see the electronic supplementary material for an analysis of the
relationship between the pretend intervention performance and
counterfactual effects performance.
