In mammals Brunton and Fayrer observed in several experiments that the
terminations of the phrenic and other nerves were paralysed by cobra yenom, but
they were unable to determine whether the failure of the respiration depended on
this or on paralysis of the medulla, and suggest that in some cases the one action
preponderates, in others the other. No convincing evidence of any paralysis of the
medulla is adduced, however. In some experiments, reflexes (Â¢.g., the corneal)
disappeared, while electrical stimulation of the cord still caused movements of the
muscles of the hind legs, and the conclusion is drawn that the grey matter of the
cord was paralysed, while the white fibres still could conduct impulses. But the
reflexes can often be restored by artificial respiration, as I have shown, and their
disappearance is therefore not due to direct action of the venom on the central
nervous system, but is the result of the asphyxia. The fact that the muscles
continue to contract on electrical stimulation of the cord does not exclude the
occurrence of curara action, unless it is shown that a continued contraction can be
induced, and not merely the weak jerks which are often seen in incomplete curara
action.

Another confusing factor which is especially liable to complicate the action in the
guinea-pig and rabbit arises from the impairment of the respiration from the
accumulation of fluid in the lungs and trachea. Together with the weakened
movements of the respiratory muscles, this may cause complete asphyxia long
before the motor nerve ends are completely paralysed in the diaphragm or
elsewhere.
