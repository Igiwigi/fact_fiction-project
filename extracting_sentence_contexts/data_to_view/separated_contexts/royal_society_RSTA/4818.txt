In contrast to the recombination of charge carriers, where coulombic attraction makes subsequent
separation unlikely, a substantial fraction of triplet encounter pairs can separate, thereby
regenerating free triplets. In fact, the high endothermicity of quintet state formation prevents
annihilation of triplet pairs that would otherwise lead to molecular quintets for many organic
molecules, including anthracene and tetracene derivatives [29,35]. For example, in the case of
rubrene, the density functional calculations show that formation of the lowest molecular quintet
state from two triplets is deficient in energy by more than 2 eV [29]. This prevents annihilation of
such pairs and changes the overall spin statistics as follows:

1 3
T14+T. = —T.
1+ 17> 48+ 5

Considering that the annihilation events resulting in triplet formation will generally consume
only one triplet, it is easy to see that the spin statics yield one singlet state per five annihilated
triplets.
