2Except at the final phase, when the tightness is established. There, one needs to show the non-trivial fact that the translates
guaranteed by tightness are actually bounded in R?, whence it easily follows that there is a minimizer in X,.


where spt(yj) = {x € R?|v;(x) # 0} and spt(wj) = {x € R?|w;(x) # 0}. Fixing € > 0, we have that for all
