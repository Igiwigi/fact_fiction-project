great exactness; in fact, any possible error in this due either to error of observations
or error in the limit chosen for the series will exert practically no influence on the
result.* A change in N might do so to some extent. Any uncertainty is due to
uncertainty in the values used for the atomic volume, which might amount to as
much as 1 per cent., ¢.g., changing 2740 by 30. The high melting-point elements of
Group IT. do not show the law with such certainty, but there are clear indications of it.
In these elements the type of formula has required a modification, and, in addition,
the series are not well developed in the higher members Sr, Ba and Ra. Consequently
the limits are not determined with such certainty as in the other cases. Nevertheless
Mg and Ca quite fall into line with the others, and even in Ra it is possible to give
some indications of the value of the density of the solid metal.

The fact that the terms depend on multiples of atomic volumes as ordinarily
calculated may be interpreted in one of two ways. Either that the periods of the
vibrating configurations do actually depend on multiples of: the essential atomic
volumes or that multiples do not enter here, but that the packing together of the
configurations when they are aggregated into solid masses is closer or less close.
£.g., compare Zn with factor 9 and Hg with factor 6. The period of Zn may depend

* An increase of ¢ in the limit of Zn would alter the ratio by (1 — -00022¢), and € cannot be more than
a few units. In the case of Ba only is ¢ indeterminate to the extent of so much as 170, and for Ba the
corresponding factor is (1 — -00013€), large enough to require a change in the multiple of v,
