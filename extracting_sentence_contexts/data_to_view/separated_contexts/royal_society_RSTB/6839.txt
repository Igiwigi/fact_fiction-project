II. THE VOMER PROBLEM

(1) Historical account

Until towards the end of the last century morphologists had little hesitation in
homologizing the mammalian vomer with the “paired vomers”’ of amphibians and
reptiles. This was a natural interpretation in view of the relations of these bones and
the fact that the ‘‘ paired vomers”’ of reptiles may fuse and even support a false palate
(Ghelonia, Crocodilia). The vomer of a mammal typically shows the following relations in the fully formed
skull. It is a median element separating the true internal nares; it touches the
premaxillae anteriorly, is clasped by the palatines posteriorly, and may touch the
pterygoids; it lies antero-ventrally to the presphenoid region, and is normally quite
anterior to the basisphenoid.
