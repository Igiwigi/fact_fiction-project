models that predict that experience with information early in
life should lead to distinct phenotypic variation [42]. We con-
clude that experience with predictive cues can lead to
individual differences in decision-making and learning per-
formance, which are important components in how animals
respond to their environment. By exposing young birds to
either predictive or non-predictive cues and testing them on
learning months after, we provide a rare longitudinal and
experimental examination of the effect of exposure to learning
opportunities on the development of cognitive traits. Our work
suggests that there are benefits to having experience with
making associations and the optimality of learning perform-
ance. These results emphasize the fact that learning abilities
are not fixed, but that learning is a developmental process

that can be shaped by information gathering opportunities in
the environment. Though work still needs to be done on the
evolution of learning at an empirical level, we suggest that
the informational properties of the developmental environ-
ment can work as a factor that could promote phenotypic
variation that may have long-term adaptive consequences [43].

turned off for the day and the birds rested for the night. Birds were
further deprived for 1h the next morning and before beginning
