course of reality, in contrast to classical physics or relativity, where our experiments, in principle,
follow what would happen in any event. In quantum physics, one decides, say, at time t;, which
experiment to perform, either the one concerning the values of the position or that concerning
the values of the momentum. This decision then enables one, by using QM, to estimate the


probability of finding either the position or the momentum of the object within a certain range at
a subsequent moment in time, tz. At the same time, performing either measurement in principle
precludes predicting such a probability for the complementary variable. If one performs two
such measurements in sequence, the outcomes will be different depending on the order in which
they are performed, because each creates a singular, unique measurement situation. As, however,
explained in ยง2, doing so requires two different experimental arrangements, and two different
quantum objects. This fact, underlain by the irreducible role of observational instruments and
the irreducible individuality of each event, is a manifestation of complementarity pertaining to
both the initial measurements used and the two alternative sequences considered, and hence
quantum-mechanical predictions concerning the outcome of possible experiments.

By contrast, in Q-L phenomena, as in cognitive psychology and decision science, say, in
experiments based on asking a given question or set of questions, the object under investigation
is a human subject, the system comprised by consciousness and the unconscious of this subject,
a C-UC system. We keep in mind that one is dealing with mental rather than physical reality,
