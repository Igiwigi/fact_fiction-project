necessary to have a term which denotes it whatever be its position, and whether it occurs in &
discharge or not. We have therefore adopted the term © blank space.” It will be found to be as che
teristic of a negative terminal as positive luminosity is of a positive terminal, however such terminal

formed.

- eumstances it is clearly imposstble that the revocation of the relief could he effective
in stopping them, and preventing them from producing phosphorescence, seeing that
consist of material particles moving at high velocities ; leaving out of considera-

ived at the opposite side of the tube before the revocation arrived.
© Tt mus not be 8upposed that this theory requires that absolutely the whole of the
x ive discharge at the firsb piece of tinfoil (7.e., the one that is nearest to the
itive terminal) should be prevented by the revocation. This would not be in
accordance with what the luminous phenomena would lead us to expect, and is not
Sountenanced by the theory itself. There has been a discharge of poxsitive electricity
From beneath the further piece of tinfoil, and this has left a quantity of negative
icity free on the surface of the glass there. This in itself nust render the
'FHnpulse of the revocation less than that of the original demand. But, the two are
_ nearly equal to prevent the negative discharge at the first piece of tinfoil
Aaving the violent character which would be necessary to produce relief-phospho-
| Wacence and to cause the negative discharge there to become a differential effect, and
