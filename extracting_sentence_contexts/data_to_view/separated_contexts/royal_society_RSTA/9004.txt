As primary radiations of shorter and shorter wave-length
% are used, the number of K electrons emitted more closely approaches the number

é emitted from C,H,Br as from air when equal absorptions of Cu, As and Se radiations
2 take place. This, however, is due to the fact that more ions are produced by a high
£ speed electron moving through C,H,Br than through air. The former is more easily
3 ionized. The factor by which the numbers 2°05, 1°94, 1°98, &c., in columns VIII.
