Text-ric. 3.—Three Diagrammatic Sagittal Sections through the Commisswra aberrans and the Lower Part
of the Paraphysis at different stages of development, to show the formation of the supra-commissural
canal and shifting of the paraphysial opening.

(For explanation of lettering see pp. 327-329.)

Not being aware of the formation of the supra-commissural canal at later stages
of the development than those which he examined, Exxior Smirn (1903) has
naturally criticised my earlier figure of a sagittal section of Stage R (1899, b, fig. 15),
showing the relations of the commissura aberrans (= commissura fornicis), on the
ground that I have represented the latter as having a complete epithelial sheath.
I must admit that the figure in question is somewhat crude, but as a matter of fact
the epithelial sheath of the commissura aberrans, in the sagittal plane, is already
nearly if not quite complete at this stage.

It has been the more necessary to dwell at some length upon the relations of the
dorsal sac, paraphysis, velwm transversum and lateral choroid plexuses, as they are
not as yet by any means generally understood. Thus, ScHavurnsLanp, who figures
an incomplete sagittal section of about my Stage S, labels the choroid plexus of the
dorsal sac as paraphysis (1903, Taf. IX, fig. 74), and the drawings given by Gist (1907)
are very incorrect. Examination of text-figs. G,O, P, and Q of the latter author
