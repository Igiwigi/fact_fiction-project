Gavss), and with that general understanding of its
meaning, which has grown up under the hypothesis, imagined by some natural philo-
sophers and now known to be erroneous, that the magnetism of the globe is analo-
gous to that, of a sphere of soft iron rendered magnetic by induction. The points of
maximum of Force have also been called * foci” or © centres of Force,” terms how-
ever which have not been suffered to pass without objection. In papers strictly
limited as these Contributions are to investigations into the facts of terrestrial mag-
netism, I have thought ir preferable to employ expressions, which although they may
bave the real disadyantage of appearing somewhat awkward, especially when they
come to be frequently repeated, are subject to no ambiguity, and are obviously un-
connected with any hypothesis. In advocating the consideration which, in a general view of the earth's magnetism,
appears to be due to the points in each hemisphere which form the centres of the
systems of isodynamic lines, and are themselves points of greatest Force, —and to the
circle or curve which encompasses the earth and unites the points in each geogra-
phical meridian where the magnetic force is weakest,—I am far from desiring an
undue importance to be attached to them, over the points where the needle is ver-
tical (or its inclination is 90*,) and over the line where the direction of the needle
is horizontal (or is parallel to the surface of the earth), No general view of terrestrial
magnetism is just, or is agreeable to our present knowledge, of which the characteristic
features of both phenomena, both of the Inclination and of the Force, do not form a
part. In purely magnetical relations indeed, —and remembering that as yet there is
no connection established between polar and gravitating forces,—the points of the
earth's surface, where the action of the magnetic forces is most intense, have, as it

appears to me, an importance beyond those where the magnetic direction, the resultant
of those forces, may happen to coincide with the direction of the gravitating force.
