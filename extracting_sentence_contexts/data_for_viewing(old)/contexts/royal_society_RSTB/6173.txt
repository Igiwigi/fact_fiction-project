so poorly differentiated from the general periventricular system that it is difficult
to trace. In Echidna the corpus mamillare is very large, but its connections are
chiefly with lower centres in the brain-stem. The connections with the fore-brain
are small despite the fact that Echidna is usually regarded as macrosmatic. It may
be that the large epithalamus supplements the fornix-mamillare-thalamic system
for it has large hypothalamic and cortical components.

Tue Pars DorsAuis DIENCEPHALI

The Ventral Group of Nuclei—This, and especially the nucleus ventralis proper, is
the most outstanding feature of the diencephalon in Echidna. ZienEN (1908)
described a nucleus lateralis which corresponds to the combined nuclei ventralis
and lateralis of this description. He also mentioned a nucleus dorso-medialis
posterior which represents the nucleus dorso-medialis, and a nucleus “ 1” which
is part of the nucleus ventralis medialis. For Ornithorhynchus Hines described a
nucleus medialis corresponding to the nucleus ventralis medialis, and nuclei dorso-
