are much slower in other cell types.

Changes in membrane curvature could influence recruit-
ment of curvature-sensing proteins, polarity of the actin
assembly and its force-generation on the membrane. This
chain of events, in turn, affects both the reaction kinetics and
means of wave propagation. The Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs
(BAR)-domain superfamily proteins are likely candidates link-
ing membrane curvature to the cortical pattern. F-BAR proteins
(FBP17, CIP4 and Toca-1) are recruited to the basal cortical
waves in mast cells [42]. This recruitment is surprising because
basal surface waves are the least likely to involve membrane
shape changes. An additional puzzling fact is that these F-
BAR waves are faster than some other basal cortical waves or
protrusive waves that also involve changes in membrane cur-
vature. It turns out that F-BAR proteins can drive shallow
inward membrane bending [89]. Changes in curvature have a
non-local effect in recruiting curvature-sensing proteins and
driving wave propagation. The membrane undulations have
small amplitudes and cannot be supported by N-BAR proteins
preferring high curvature. This is a different mechanism com-

changes in amplitude and frequency of FBP17 oscillations,
respectively [67]. Mechanistically, such differential effects
occur because the PIP2 network includes synaptojanin 2, the
