These results considered in connection with the fact that the secondary radiation
from heavy metals differs considerably in character from the primary producing it are
significant. In light substances, on the electronic theory, the distances between the
electrons are greater than in the heavier substances. It seems possible that this is
the immediate cause of the difference, for when the distance apart becomes so small
as to be comparable with a pulse thickness the theory is not such a simple one as
that given, as there are mutual actions between the electrons. Other possibilities
might be discussed, as that of the vibration frequency in the heavier atoms being
such as to cause a radiation having ionizing power not possessed by that proceeding
from the electrons of lighter atoms, or of a temporary radioactivity being set up in
the heavier atoms by the transmission of X-rays. Experiments are being made on
the subject, and will be treated in a later paper on Secondary Radiation from Metals.
