vertical circular cylinder frozen in the ice cover of infinite extent by the vertical mode method
and by the method based on the Weber integral transform in the radial coordinate, see [3], are
identical. In this study, we generalize the method of vertical modes to any shapes of vertical
walls. However, the numerical results are still shown only for circular cylinders. The vertical
modes of ice sheet of constant thickness floating on water of finite depth were introduced in
[10,11] and were successfully applied to two-dimensional problems of hydroelasticity without
vertical boundaries in several papers.

This study is motivated by the need for some offshore structures, such as oil production
platforms and wind farms, to be built far north in ice-covered waters [4]. The aim of the paper is
to explain the application of the vertical mode method to three-dimensional problems of flexural-
gravity waves interacting with vertical cylinders. If the wave-structure interaction problem has a
unique solution, then the vertical mode method provides this solution, despite the fact that the
vertical modes are linearly dependent and not necessary form a complete set of functions, see §5.

2. Formulation of the problem

The fluid flow and ice deflection are caused by an incident hydroelastic wave,
Wine(X, t) = A cos (kx — wf), (2.1)

propagating in the positive x-direction (figure 1), where A is the amplitude of the incident wave,
k is the wavenumber and is the wave frequency. A tilde stands for dimensional variables. Here
real and positive w and k are related by the dispersion equation of flexural-gravity waves. The
linear problem of the incident uni-directional flexural-gravity wave interacting with a vertical
bottom-mounted cylinder is formulated in non-dimensional variables (without tilde). The water
