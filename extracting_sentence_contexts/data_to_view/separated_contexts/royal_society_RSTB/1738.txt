But at the same time, these young fibres are
separated by much dense connective tissue, which in some places is massed together
to the exclusion of young nerve fibres (Plate 5, figs. 3 to 6; Plate 6, fig. 1). This
mass has evidently been supplied with nerve fibres by immigration into it of
neuroblasts, either from the central end or from both. I think from both ends, from
the fact that both central and peripheral ends of nerves, remaining entirely
separated, show at their ends a mass of connective tissue containing nerve fibres. The latter do not run in parallel lines, as they do when met in a piece of old nerve,
