temperature between any two elements of the vertical parts. Thus the isothermal
region, which begins where the abrupt change of the temperature gradient sets in, is
shifted bodily upwards over A and downwards over C, and the invariable phenomenon
of a high value for H, with the anticyclone and the low one with the cyclone is
produced. The slow warming by radiation over A does not alter the level, for
presumably the neighbouring strata are about equally warmed, but the readjustment
required to meet this -warming carries the isothermal upward again, and thus a
considerable increase of its height may be brought about.*

Velocity of the Wind at Various Levels.

If this theory of the local circulation be correct, it follows that the winds must
continue upwards to a considerable height. In fact, it seems inevitable that the

* May 30.—Since this was written it has been found that at least for the English ascents there is a very
close relationship between the value of H, and the pressure at 10 km.

winds must continue up to the height at which the isobaric surfaces are level planes,
or rather spheroids concentric with the earth. It will be seen from the diagrams that
this point lies at a height of about 20 km., and the number and consistency of the
observations is sufficient to make this fairly certain. The slope of the isobaric surface
reaches the same value that it has at the earth’s surface at about 16 km., and if we
