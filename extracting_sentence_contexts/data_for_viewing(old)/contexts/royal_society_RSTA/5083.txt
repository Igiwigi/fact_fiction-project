the presence of a weld crown would affect the T-stiffener tension results [31]. A butt-welded HT
plate was modelled featuring a weld crown on both sides of the weld material and an interior
weld flaw. For the early stages of tensile loading, the strain energy density relative to the weld
metal critical value was initially higher at the flaw tip compared with the corresponding relative
maximum in the base metal near the base and weld metal boundary.

As the tensile loading progressed, the base metal cross section yielded, which resulted in
unloading of the of the stronger weld material with the wider net cross section. Continued loading
increased the maximum relative strain energy to the point where the fracture initiation location
shifted from the weld metal to an area near the weld metal and base metal interface. This change
in location was a direct result of the weld and base metal nonlinear material responses and the
presence of the weld crown. This analysis also demonstrated that the defect was a less critical
feature of this system and the base metal would in fact govern fracture initiation.

The analyses provided excellent insights into the role of these weld flaws in fracture initiation
and quantitative input into the ship maintenance decision process. They were based on the
material behaviours and fracture properties, and predicted weld flaw fracture initiation without
an a priori specification of location.


In the second study of weld flaws, a three-dimensional finite-element analysis was conducted | 2 |
for similar weld-defect geometries in a T-stiffener flange reinforcing a section of hull plate [32].

The hull plate was subjected to transverse pressure loading. The stiffener flange was 4.0 inches ar
wide, the web was 10.0 inches tall and both sections were 0.2 inches thick. The weld with : a
