base station was certainly as good as 1 x 1077 sec.

For a discussion of the overall accuracy of the base-station results see § 3-4 below.

3-3. SEA-STATION OBSERVATIONS

The records made during a dive differ from the base-station records mainly on account
of the irregular motion of the middle pendulum record and the fluctuations of the chrono-
meter marks. During most of the observations care was taken to dive sufficiently deep to
avoid any serious errors. It was found that, using the graphical method of averaging out the
fluctuations, the self-consistency of the eight determinations of the coincidence interval
(approximately 200 sec.) gave a probable error of only +0-015 sec. This indicates that the
period of one of the fictitious pendulums could be measured to within +-2 x 107’ sec. The
estimated accuracy of the other corrections is as follows:

(i) Temperature as for base station: +2 x 1077 sec.

(ii) Density. Owing to small changes in calibration the pressure and humidity could not
be so accurately determined at sea as on land. At most stations the error is not likely to
exceed +3 x 1077 sec.

(iti) Arc, deviation from isochronism and tilt. These corrections all depend on the magnitude
of the perturbations caused by horizontal accelerations. Except at those stations where
observations were purposely made at shallow depths, the accuracy with which these
corrections can be measured is --4 x 10-7 sec.
