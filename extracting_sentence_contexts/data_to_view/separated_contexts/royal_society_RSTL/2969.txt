Similar relics I have found in the

anatomy of the mole-cricket. 207

two following facts attest- in the tribe of - insects to which
the mole-cricket belongs a remarkable degree of voracity,
and an equally remarkable power of abstaining from food. My friend Dr. MacarTxEy, of Dublin, informs me that he
has known a gryllus devour a portion of its own body : on
the other hand, my friend Mr. BucxLan, of this University,
gave me, at the commencement of the present summer, a
living gryllotalpa, which had been confined during nine. or
ten months in a tin case, containing a small quantity of garden
mould, without the possibility of having met with any other
nourishment than such as that portion of mould might be
supposed to contain.
