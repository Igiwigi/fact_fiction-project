xylem may be noticed within the genus Lycopodium. In this genus, although the
central (cauline) xylem is usually well developed, in many species it is represented by
a single strand, which in some transverse sections may appear as an isolated group
of tracheides. Thus a section closely similar to fig. 13, Plate 5, of the present paper
has been figured by Miss Wig@LEswortn* in the young sporophyte of L. complanatum,
and I have myself seen the same feature in the adult stems of two Indian species,
namely, L. Hamiltonii and L. setacewm.t

So far as the distribution of the xylem is concerned, a section such as that shown in
Kidston and Lang’s fig. 52, Plate 7,{ bears a close comparison with text-fig. 2 6 of the
present paper. As these authors point out, the mesarch protoxylem of T'mesipteris
finds its counterpart in Asteroxylon, and the same feature has been demonstrated by
Sinnott§ in some species of Lycopodium. The resemblance is increased by the fact,
now demonstrated, that in the genus T'mesipteris the stele of the aerial stem is not
ectophloic, as generally described, but that phloem also occurs laterally and centri-
petally to the bundles of the ring. The lateral phloems would correspond to the
phloem which occupies the bays between the xylem salients of Asterorylon and
Lycopodium.

The facts before us appear fully to warrant the suggestion that the scattered medullary
strands of 7m. Vieillardi are the vestiges of a once continuous axial column running
presumably through the whole length of the stem. In the retention of medullary
xylem and of its erect terrestrial habit 7m. Vieillardi has apparently lagged behind the
other forms of the genus, which seem to be gradually relinquishing their primitive
terrestrial home. It is tempting to trace the elimination of medullary xylem in
