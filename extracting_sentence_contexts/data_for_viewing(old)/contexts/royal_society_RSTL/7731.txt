repeated several times have failed to detect it. Were it a broad band having the same
total amount of light, it would be invisible in the spectroscope; it has probably there-
fore reached this stage.

III. The prominences have been obseryed of yarious colours (this fact is not here
stated merely with reference to the obseryation recorded in ILL ante).

IV. There is @ line in the yellow, most probably proceeding from the substance which
gives off the light at C and F, as the length of this line, as far as the later observations
with the more correctly adjusted instrument go, is the same as that of those in C and P.

I am aware that the conditions as to density cannot for one moment be held to be the
same in the two cases; but as at present (ï¬† far as I know) we have no similar expe-
riments ranging over greatly varying densities, I have thought it desirable to bring these
striking facts forward at once. We are justified in thinking that the density of the
chromosphere, always assuming that it is composed wholly or in part of hydrogen, can-
not be very great ; if it were, the spectrum would most probably be continuous; for Pro-
