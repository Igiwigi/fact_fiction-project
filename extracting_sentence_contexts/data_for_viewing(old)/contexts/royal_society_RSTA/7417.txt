In addition to Assumptions C 1 and 2, Assumption C 3 is made in §§ 6-9 and 6-10 regarding
the variation during burning of the different terms constituting the ‘tolerance functions’
Jyy My and pz of (4-2-9, 10,11). We may write each of 4, 2, #3 in the form

= Sfaplr) +inbplo)Jape (3-68:1

where ap(v) and 6,(v) are coefficients which are constant or vary slowly during burning
(see § 6-10). The assumption is as follows:

C3. The following quantities are constant during burning:
a,(v) Xp, bp(v) Xp, op (P =C, G, L, M, N, R).

In actual fact the quantities e» and ¢, will probably vary in an irregular manner during
burning, but Assumption C 3 is justifiable in order to obtain an indication of the relative
maximum magnitudes of the effects of the different asymmetries. See §§ 6-9, 6-10 for further
discussion of this assumption.

3-7. DEFINITIONS

A large number of definitions has already been made, in particular Definitions 1 to 4
of §3-5. We collect here a number of definitions which are frequently used in the succeeding
work. Other definitions are introduced more conveniently as the need arises.

The instant of ignition is the instant at which the projectile first commences to move relative
to the projector.
