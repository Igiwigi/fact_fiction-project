shown by the continuous curvature of the curves which express these results. (See
Plates 47, 48, and 49.)

TIT. The uniformity in direction in which both the time of transpiration under
pressure (se Tables XIV. to XVII.), and the ratio of the thermal differences of
pres8ure to the mean pressure (Se Tables IIT. to XIIL.) vary as the density increased.

IV. The fact, sufficiently proved by GRAHAm, that, ceteris paribus, the times of
transpiration are proportional to the ratio of the differences of pressure to the mean
pressure, the difference of pressure being small.

V. The fact, to a certain extent taken for granted, that the ratio of the thermal
differences of pressure to the mean pressure are, exteris paribus, proportional to the
ratio of the difference of temperature to the absolute temperature, this ratio being
gmall,

VI. The continual approximation towards constancy of the time of transpiration
under pressure as the density diminished. (See Tables XIV. to XVIL. and diagram 1,
Plate 47.)

VII. The relation between the ultimate values of the times of transpiration for
different gases (air and hydrogen) for small densities ; the times are proportional to the
8quare roots of their atomic weights. (See Art. 42.)
