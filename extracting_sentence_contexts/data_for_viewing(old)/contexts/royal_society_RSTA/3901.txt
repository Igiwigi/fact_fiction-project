data owing to its physical size. Therefore, a virtual gauge was included at 50mm distance from
the free end with an area of 20 x 1mm that represents characteristic grid size of conventional
polyester foil gauges used in this type of experiment (PFL-20-11). The linear regression on the
reconstructed stress-strain curve was performed, and the identified stiffness was within the
confidence interval with an error of less than 0.1%. Both simulated sequences showed some
variations in the identification results with almost the same standard deviation, making it difficult
to confirm which grid pattern is most suitable for the method employed.

Systematic errors in local phase shifting algorithm can arise from framing a grid signal close
to binary one, black lines on a white background. Even though a high-contrasted grid pattern
is desirable regarding a reduction of spatial noise, the high-frequency content caused by a close
to bimodal grid distribution can locally introduce fictive distortion to framed grid images [15].
A positive effect of blurring was already presented in the case of direct extraction of strain

measurements [72]. Here, the beneficial effect of slight optical blurring of the grid image used : =
for the identification procedure is demonstrated by simply recreating a deformed sequence of : S
bimodal grid images and comparing the identification results obtained with a VFM processor 73
to the same image sequence with applied fast Fourier transform (FFT) blur. The results for the aed
identification as well as a profile of a bimodal grid before and after applying the filtering are 22
presented in figure 10. : 4

Indeed, it can be observed that when a binary grid is considered, owing to high harmonics DNS
present in the images, the phase detection algorithm fails to properly capture the deformation of : S
the sample. This disruption of phase detection is observed as well in the reconstructed stress field :3
