sis. Apoptosis is a complex process involving multiple
regulatory mechanisms that occur in a step-wise manner.
On the level of RNA, initial apoptotic mitochondrial outer
membrane permeabilisation (MOMP) induces a_ global
degradation of translation-competent mRNAs but not of non-
coding RNAs at the onset of apoptosis [189,190]. The global
mRNA decay is induced by TUT4/7-mediated uridylation
and executed by DIS3L2 3â€™-5' exoribonuclease [189]. Simul-
taneously, pre-mRNA splicing and RNA nuclear export are
inhibited, which prevents the production of stress-responsive
factors [191] and precedes phosphatidylserine externalization
and DNA fragmentation. In fact, knock-down of TUTases or
DIS3L2 leads to anti-apoptotic effects and increases survival
of cells exposed to apoptotic stimuli [180,189].


Recent evidence identifies another crucial role of TUTases most likely represent degradation intermediates, thus strongly | 9 |

These results come from a study with TUT4/7 conditional 7-mediated uridylation and rely on subsequent degradation by a
