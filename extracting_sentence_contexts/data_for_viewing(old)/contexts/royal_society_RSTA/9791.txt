Allthree groups . .. .. . . 861°890.

In Groups II. and III. it is possible too much weight has been-given to Hg, v, and
Tl. We will take as the preliminary value for g that of silver, viz., 361°81, which is
practically that of the general weighted mean. The true value cannot vary much
from this—probably less than ‘2. With this, the subsidiary values become 180°90+ ‘1
and 90°45+'05.

Tt is seen that in the doublet groups all the elements can come within this limit.
In fact, with the exception of K and Ga, they come extremely close. Ga is
spectroscopically uncertain as well as in its atomic weight, and the uncertainty of K
is due to the uncertainty in its value of ». In the triplet groups also, all calculated
from A,+A, have possible variations which will bring them within, although the
closeness is not so marked as for the doublet elements. The sequence formule are
well established in Groups I. and III., but there are uncertainties in Group IL. which
yet require clearing up. In this relation also, the table shows slight regular variations
as, e.g., A, and A, err from the general mean in different directions, but in these cases

the values of A,+A, come much closer to it. The values of (A,+A,)/w* are therefore
