What reason then have we for supposing, when a chemical agent applied to
the muscular fibre excites it, that it operates through the nerves which till
adhere to it. Such an inference implies that nerves in their progress wholly
change their nature, a supposition for which there is not only not a shadow of
proof, but against which the most convincing proofs, which analogy can supply,
present themselves. Dr. Hexsry indeed adduces in favour of the opinion of agents affecting the
muscles only through the intervention of the nerves, a fact which is well ascer-
tained, and which I amongst others have frequently witnessed, that the exci-
tability of distant muscles may be impaired by chemical agents applied to the
sentient extremities of the nerves; but here the brain and spinal marrow inter-
vene between the nerves affected by the agent, and the musecles influenced. The effect of the agent is communicated through the neryes to these organs,

and the debility of the muscles is the effect of the morbid impression made on
them. IN THE MORE PERFECT ANIMALS.
