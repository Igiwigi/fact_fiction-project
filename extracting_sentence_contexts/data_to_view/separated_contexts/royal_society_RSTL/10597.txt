In the soft wire the final induced magnetism under
and under 6 kilos. differs by less than 2 per cent., but the residual magnetism has
Zhe widely different values 1092 or 86 per cent. of the induced, and 847 or 68 per
cent, The same thing is still more striking in the stretched wire, where indeed the
condition of no load gives slightly more induced but much less residual magnetism
than the condition of stress gives. The retentiveness of the soft wire is reduced, and
that of the stretched wire greatly increased by the presence of stress during the
application and removal of magnetising force.
$ 107. The Villari Critical Point.—Allusion has been made ($ 87) to the fact,
discovered by Villari, and afterwards by Thomson, that if we take a wire under the
influence of a longitudinal magnetising force, and alternately apply and remove a
given load, * on” gives augmentation and © off” gives diminution of magnetism if the
magnetisation is less than a certain value ; but © on” gives diminution, and * off ”
