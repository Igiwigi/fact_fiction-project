A second specimen of a milk dentition of the same species may be mentioned. This
is a much younger animal with the first milk tooth only just erupting, the second and
third erupted but quite unworn, and the fourth coming up out of its socket. This
specimen agrees closely with the one described above, but its perfect and unworn
condition shows certain further details, such as the fact that the proto- and meta-lophs
join the ectolophs low down and do not reach the top of the external crest as they do
in the permanent teeth, fig. 23, Plate 64. These two specimens show accurately the order of eruption of the teeth, which
takes place as follows :â€”

The second and third milk teeth are the first to appear and are followed by the
fourth, which erupts a little ahead of the first. By the time that all four milk teeth
are in wear, the second and third being more worn than the first and fourth, the first
molar appears, followed in due course by the other molars.
