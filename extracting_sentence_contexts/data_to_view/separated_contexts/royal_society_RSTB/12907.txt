The benefit
men should devote greater effort to short-term and extra- to males is an exclusive access to mates and a better chance to
pair mating. Indeed, women could benefit from polyandry obtain female sexual fidelity and paternity certainty. More-

showing that the range of variation in extra-pair paternity for both sexes via protection from infanticide. An alternative

previously thought [84]. In some contexts, men may be for H. erectus, assuming that this species was living in chim-

choosing to provide care for non-biological children as part panzee-like fission-fusion groups, with immigrant females


and a large number of bonded males.
