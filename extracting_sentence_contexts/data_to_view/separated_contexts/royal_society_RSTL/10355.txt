been obtained from the previously accumulated stores within the 80il. Tt would 8eem,
too, more than probable that the source of the continued large yield of nitrogen on
plot 6, after the discontinuance of the application of the ammonia-salts, is also to be
attributed, mainly at any rate, to a supply rendered available from earlier accumula-
tions, rather than to the unrecovered residue of the previously applied ammonia-salts,

The mineral composition of the herbage as remarkably illustrates the difference in
the character of growth as do the facts in regard to the nitrogen. Leaving fuller _
details on both points for the third or chemical part of our report, it may be 8tated
that, even in the firs year after the change, very much more total mineral matter,
and especially very much more potass, and phosphorie acid also, was taken up on
plot 6 than on plot 5. Indeed, over the 12 years since the change of manuring,
nearly twice as much total mineral matter has been taken up in the first and 8econd
crops of plot 6 as in those of plot 5; but even on plot 6 less has been taken up than
on plot 7 during the same period.
