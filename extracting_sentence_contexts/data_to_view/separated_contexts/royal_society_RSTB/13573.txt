As noted by Grosjean [94], at least half of the
world’s population speaks more than one language, and a more
recent survey of countries of the European Union [95] found that
on average 63% people speak another language, ranging from
74% in people aged 25 to 34 years to 47% in people aged 55 to
64 years. Thus, our sample has a relatively large percentage of
people speaking a foreign language, especially English. The large
percentage of speakers of English as a foreign language could
stem from the fact that the sample was snowballed using the
authors’ own social networks. Moreover, the internet-based distribution
method probably taps into a more educated population.

The rounded and spike shapes, shown in figure 1, were adapted
from the cross-cultural experiment conducted by Bremner ef al.
[37]. The bouba and kiki stimuli were spoken by the first author,
a female native speaker of Polish who is a trained phonetician.
