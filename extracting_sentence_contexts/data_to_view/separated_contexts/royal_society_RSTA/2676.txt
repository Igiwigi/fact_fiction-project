In addition to the
usual diffusion (assumed to be isotropic here for simplicity), the water flows down the slope. This is represented by the cv; term (positive c assumes the water flows from right to left). In fact
equations (5.1) are special case of Klausmeier model when water evaporation is assumed small
(water evaporation is modelled by adding —ev term to the right-hand side of (5.1b)). There are numerous papers studying the transition between homogeneous vegetation,
vegetation spots and vegetation stripes, as well as self-replication. For a very incomplete list of
references, see for example [4,14—22] and references therein.
