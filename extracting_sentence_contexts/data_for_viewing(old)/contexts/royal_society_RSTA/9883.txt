D, (0) = —{log 2—y—dur) Jn (Q)—Y, (2)},

J,(¢) and Y,,(¢) have their usual significance as Bessel functions, and A,, B,, «,, and
8, are arbitrary constants.

It need hardly be remarked that to obtain the actual expressions for ¢ and yp it is
necessary to multiply the expressions contained in (11) by e“, and to equate ¢ and ys
to the real parts only of these products. For the sake of brevity we shall usually
omit, when possible, the time factor e'.

Since, in the case of air, v is a small quantity, when expressed in em. sec. units, it
is clear from (9) and (10) that for all audible sounds |/| will be large compared with
|h|. In fact, at any ordinary distance r from the origin the # terms in (11) will
become insensible owing to the factor exp. {—($0/v)'" 7}.

For plane waves propagated in the negative direction of the axis of «, the solution

where, as before, only the real part of ¢ is to be taken into account.
