must have a direct cause or direct causes. One question is, therefore, whether the
abnormal or oblique phenomena of development are so related to one another that
direct causation can be déduced from their sequence. If so, what is the binding law
of the causation ; or, what theory will best describe the facts ?

With regard to the relation between the phenomena, it is true that the asymmetry
develops in a regular manner, just as if it belonged to the ordinary course of develop-
ment, but if we compare the life histories of different species, we find that the
progressiveness or rate of change from the normal depends upon recognisable factors
(ef. Pleuronectes and Gilyptocephalus, S. vulgaris and S. variegata). Secondly, the
extreme asymmetry peculiar to Flat-fishes, viz., that of the skull, is invariably
preceded by certain changes in the head and body. Hence the possibility of direct
causation may be concluded. A brief survey of the facts, having the adult structure
in mind as well as the development, will show how far this conclusion is justified and
pave the way for a constructive theory.

The nature of the oblique growths or departures from the normal varies in the
ditferent regions. In the skull the changes are obviously due to pressure or stresses ;
apart from their tendency to grow, the structures are quite passive. ‘The eye is not
pulled into its new position by the frontals or its own muscles; it is demonstrably
pushed over by the growth of the subocular ligament or the prefrontal. These again
are constrained to grow obliquely by outside pressure. Where rupture of the tissues
is apparent, it is not due simply to the structures growing apart ; they are definitely
forced apart (e.g., frontals in Bothus, frontal and prefrontal in Pleuronectoids and
Rhomboids, vomer and ethmoid in Solea). The parasphenoid, the trabecular and
