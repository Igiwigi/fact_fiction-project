The key concept of the LI approach is the plausibility, denoted by P(A|B), which, in general,
expresses the degree of belief of an individual that proposition A is true, given that proposition


B is true [25,26,28,44]. The plausibility P(A | B) is an intermediate mental construct that serves
to carry out inductive logic, that is rational reasoning, in a mathematically well-defined
manner [26,28].

The algebra of LI can be derived from three so-called ‘desiderata’, namely (i) plausibilities are
represented by real numbers, (ii) plausibilities must exhibit agreement with rationality and (iii) all rules
relating plausibilities must be consistent [25-28]. These three desiderata only describe the essential
features of the plausibilities and are not a set of axioms that plausibilities have to satisfy. It is a
most remarkable fact that these three desiderata suffice to uniquely determine the set of rules
by which plausibilities may be manipulated [25-28]. It can be shown [25-28] that plausibilities
may be chosen to take numerical values in the range [0,1] and these values are related by
three rules, namely: (1) P(A|Z) + P(A|Z)=1, where A denotes the negation of proposition A
and Z is a proposition assumed to be true; (2) the ‘product rule’ P(AB| Z) = P(A | BZ)P(B|Z) =
P(B|AZ)P(A|Z), where the ‘product’ BZ denotes the logical product (conjunction) of the : =
propositions B and Z; and (3) P(AA|Z)=0 and P(A + A|Z) =1, where the ‘sum’ A + B denotes : 5
the logical sum (inclusive disjunction) of the propositions A and B [25-28]. The algebra of LI, as :
defined by the rules (1)-(3), contains Boolean algebra as a special case and is the foundation for nee)
powerful tools such as the maximum entropy method and Bayesian analysis [26,28]. The rules (1)— :
(3) are unique [26-28]: any other rule which applies to plausibilities represented by real numbers a]
and is in conflict with rules (1)-(3) will be at odds with rational reasoning and consistency, as DNS
embodied by the desiderata (i)—(iii). It should be mentioned here that it is not allowed to define a if
