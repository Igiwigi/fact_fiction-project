on the Planet Venus. 221

in the same manner as myself. It is here scarcely necessary to
remind the reader, with respect to the ancient observations,
that in all those where no: extraordinary light is wanted, par-
ticularly powerful telescopes are by no means required. 1
should: indeed be surprised that the celebrated author had not,
in all the time since 1777, perceived any inequality in the
boundary of light, or other appearance of that kind, tending to
confirm the existence of very high mountains according to the
old observations, were: it not that his bold spirit of investiga-
tion has been chiefly employed in making much more exten-
sive discoveries in the far distant regions of the heavens, where
he has gathered- unfading laurels. In fact, the observations
which he has communicated from his journal are much too few
to prove a negative against old and recent astronomers. With-
out encroaching upon truth in the least, I could certainly pro-
duce more good distinet observations during many months, from
1779, when I began to examine Venus carefully, to 179g, when
my memoir on her rotation was finished, than are adduced for
a period of 16 years in the abovementioned paper of my op-
ponent : having; in the latter years, observed this planet not
only daily, but, as far as the weather and her position ad-
mitted, almost hourly through the whole day and evening. This, I think, is shewn evidently enough by the memoir al-
ready mentioned, in which only the later observations- apper-
taining to the subject are inserted : and without such steady
perseverance, my trouble for s0 many+-years would have been
fruitless, as was the case with other observers ; for, in almos!
innumerable observations, the same thing happened to me as to the
author of the paper in question, namely, T perceived neither spots,

nor any other remarkable appearance, except the unusually quick
