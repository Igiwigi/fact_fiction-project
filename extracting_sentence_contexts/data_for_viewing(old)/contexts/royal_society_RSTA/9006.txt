red spectra consist mainly of lines of the F type. But the red or first spectra are
outside the scope of the present communication. Although it is a very lengthy one
as it stands only the beginning of an analysis has been made. The aim has been to
lay the foundation for the series framework of this family of elements, and little
beyond has been done. The linkages, as a whole, have not been isolated, the red
spectra not touched upon, and many interesting effects which will require clearing up
are passed over without reference. A great field for investigation is open in these
and other spectra for any who are willing to give the necessary time and patience.
In some few cases the presentation might have been slightly. shortened by merely
stating the final result and showing how the necessary conditions are satisfied. But
not only would this have passed over certain phenomena of special interest, but
one of the objects of the present.communication would have been missed, viz., to
illustrate the power of the new facts to guide a search even when the details
are most bewildering. Moreover, the evidence itself is the more striking when
developed from step to step than when the result is directly presented as a finished
product.

Krypton.â€”Krypton shows two spectra, without and with capacity, the former in
the red region and the latter further towards the blue. We have measures of some
of the stronger lines by Runar, and a considerable number of weaker lines, not
observed by others, by Liverne and Dewar, although the latter are only given to
