n. Importance is also to be attached to the cireumstance that dogs of impure breed
ere always employed. The second objection is of little value ; for it is well known that
the tranquil breathing the rhythmical laryngeal movements have no appreciable in-
ence on those of the thorax. But the third is of sufficient weight to demand not only
nsideration but special inquiry.

In preliminary experiments I found that when the caoutchoue bag was connected with
Emask placed loosely over the animal's mout, the movements communicated to the lever
were of the same nature as those represented in the tracings, although of greater extent.
a also repeatedly found that the apparatus was s0 sensible that if the aperture of the
HS, tube was placed opposite the nostril at an inch distance. the opposite aperture being
ved, movements of the lever were produced by the air passing in and out in ordinary
teathing. By these facts, as well as by the comparison of the width of the T tube with
tHat of the natural air-passages, I was convinced that, so far from the resistance afforded
ing greater, it was considerably less than in ordinary breathing through the nostrils.
rther, from what I believed I had ascertained as to the mode in which the results are

IBoduced, I was led to expect that they would not have been in the slightest degree mo-
fied even if the resistance had been many times as great as it actually was. For the
Furpose of testing the truth of this assumption I made the following experiment.
