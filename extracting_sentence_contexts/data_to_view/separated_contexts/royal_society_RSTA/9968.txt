As before, in the amplitudes
unity represents 1 volt per metre. The angles are given only to the nearest degree. The representation of the annual variation by two terms of the series is, as a
matter of fact, not very close in any one of the elements. This may mean that other
shorter period terms are by no means negligible, or merely that a larger number of
yearâ€™s data are necessary for high precision.
