frequent than laughs. Standard error bars illustrate the reliability of these differences, although the standard errors were so small for the laughs that they are
contained within the square markers. (b) Based on all-day recordings of 12 typically developing infants in the Memphis sample, the patterns were similar to
those from the Atlanta sample, although given the smaller sample size, the error bars are larger. (c) Based on laboratory samples for the same 12 infants in
Memphis, the patterns confirm those from the all-day recordings, although rates of protophones and cries were lower at the older ages than the younger
ones in the laboratory. Means and standard errors for figure 1 were computed at the infant level.

Figure 2a illustrates a salient effect of parent-infant inter- 4. Discussion
action, where laughter, as expected, was most frequent in ,
the second half-year during the Parent Infant Talk sessions. (a) The high frequency of protophones and the

The existence of the small amount of laughter in the No
Adult Talk and Adult to Adult Talk sessions may be due to
the fact that parents occasionally violated recording protocol
and attended to infants briefly. Note that the scales are differ-
ent for figure 2a versus 2b and 2c to make it possible better to
visualize the differences in the low laugh rates across ages.
Regardless of circumstances or age, protophones (figure 2c)
were >14 times more frequent than laughs in the laboratory
at every age and every circumstance. The very high rate of
cry/whimper at the youngest age (figure 2b) in the No
Adult Talk circumstance can be attributed, we think, to
infant protest at being left in a crib or stroller with little or
no adult attentionâ€”mothers did not allow the crying to go
on too long, choosing to hold the infant while reading if
the infant persisted in crying. Figure 2a shows that at the
