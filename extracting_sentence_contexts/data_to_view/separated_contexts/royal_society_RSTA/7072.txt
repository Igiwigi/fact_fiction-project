This aspect of heat sensitiveness is briefly described in § (d) and is referred to more
fully in part IIT (4). A point of considerable practical importance, which emerges from the experiments
described, relates to the effect of grit on Service azide. A point of theoretical interest arises from the fact that dextrin azide is more sensitive to
heat below 416° G, so that if the action of grit friction is to be explained by the production
of local ‘hot spots’ these must involve temperatures considerably above 416° C in the case
of lead azide.
