peculiar to the
ruminants, and is certainly very different, and much more
imperfect than the mastication of the horse, whose molares
are very compact in the texture of their crowns, and are op-
posed directly to each other by horizontal planes,

Letter from Charles Hatchett, Esq. concerning some Peculiarities
in the Urine of the Camel,
DEAR SIR, April 30, 1806,

Being a $hort time absent from my house, and not having
at hand any apparatus to examine the camel's urine, which
you lately sent to me, I delivered it to my friend, Mr. W.
Braxve, of Arlington-street, who has on several occasions
much distinguished .himself in chemical Science, and I now
have the pleasure of transmitting an account of the results of
his comparative experiments on the urine of the camel and
the cow, which, I think, appear to be highly deserving of
attention. The presence of uric acid in the former, and that of phos-
phat of lime in both, are new facts, which reflect additional
light on the compoxsition of the urine of graminivorous animals. Mr. Branve first states his experiments on the camel's
urine as f.llows ;

* I divided it into two equal portions, taking half for distfl-
lation, which was performed at a very low temperature.
