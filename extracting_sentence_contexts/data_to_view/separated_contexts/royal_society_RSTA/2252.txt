can there be a common refinement, a PDI consisting of all the non-zero P;Q;; otherwise they are
incompatible and cannot be combined. The CH approach resolves (or evades or tames) the standard
quantum paradoxes by means of the single framework rule, which prohibits as meaningless those
arguments which reach some conclusion by (often implicitly) combining properties belonging to
incompatible PDIs or frameworks; the latter term can include PDIs involving events at different
times. An immediate application to the present discussion arises from the fact that the {Mj}, the
possible measurement outcomes, form a PDI. But there is another PDI with just two projectors,
[W] and I, — [W], with [¥] = |W) (| the weird ‘cat’ property introduced above, and I,, the identity
on the apparatus Hilbert space Hm. This PDI, {[¥], Im — [W]}, is incompatible with the {Mj} PDI
when, as we are assuming, two or more of the rj are non-zero.
