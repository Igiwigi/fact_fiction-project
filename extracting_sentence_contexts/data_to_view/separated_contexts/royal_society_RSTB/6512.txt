x 3, from the holotype. The holotype, which at first sight suggests a spherical form, has been somewhat
distorted, but there is no doubt that here again the mouth is excentric. We can deduce from the fossil remains two important facts: (1) that the test was
thinner than in either Aulechinus or Ectinechinus; (2) that the test was elongate, with
mouth and anus at opposite poles very much as in Ectinechinus. The reconstructions (figs. 14A,B) are based on the above deductions.
