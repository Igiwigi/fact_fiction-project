Some conjec-
tures, ſupported by a few facts, are hazarded concerning
the cauſe of unhealthineſs in the ſuburbs. Future ob-
ſervations of a like kind, in different ſituations, will con-
fute or confirm theſe conjectures, which, if true, may
be of great importance to ſociety by diſcovering and
ayoiding the ſource of diſeaſe. Towns divided and num-
bered in ſeparate diſtricts, compared with their reſpe&tive
regiſters, and illuſtrated with a deſcription of every cir-
cumſtance peculiar to each, that may be ſuppoſed to in-
fluence health, might, by a numerous induction of facts,
lead to a certain inveſtigation of the cauſe that renders
towns ſo generally unhealty. A diligent and fagacious
attention to this ſubject might produce a diſcovery how
to make towns as healthy as the country : a diſcovery of
the moſt beneficial conſequence in this age of elegant
refinement which collects the greateſt part of mankind
into large towns.
