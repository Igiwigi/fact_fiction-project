As the exact measure of these
three brass spheres was, however, a matter of importance in this inquiry, I exa-
mined them more minutely, and found them to be 1-465, 2065, and 3-030 inches
respectively. So that the weight of adhesive air for the last two spheres will
be almost exactly as the cubes of their diameters; and, for the first two, not,
materially differing therefrom. In fact, if the weights of air were 387, 1084,
and 3:422 grains respectively, the whole would agree precisely with this hypo-
thesis. Tt is worthy of remark that, in the case of the spheres No. 1 to 7, sus-
pended by a wire (se the Table in page 433), and No. 66 in the following set,
if we consider the weight of air, dragged by the wire alone, as equal to 0:10
grain, and deduct this yalue successively from the mean weight of air dragged
by the 1:46 and the 2:06 inch spheres respectively, as there given, and by the
3:03 inch brass sphere as given in the following set of experiments, we shall
have 0373, 1:040, and 3:444 grains for the weight of air dragged by the spheres
alone.
