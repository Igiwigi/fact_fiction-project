the total mass (biomass) of the population also decreases. During this process, the survival
curve falls very sharply for all three species.

(iv) Mortality. Theoretically it should be possible for a population of 16-8 maximum-
sized Lucilia larvae to develop on 1 g. of consumable meat. This number is attained in one
series only where an initial population of 45-6 larvae/g. was present. The final population
was 26-43 larvae/g., but these were 36-7Â°% below the full size. There was thus a high
mortality combined with a considerable reduction in size.

As noted previously, there is a positive correlation between mortality and the density of
the population, the numbers of deaths increasing in geometrical progression as the number
of larvae per gram of meat is increased. This behaviour of mortality accounts, in a large
measure, for the fact that, in order to obtain a maximum production of larvae by weight,
there must be an inordinately high initial:larval population. In the case just quoted,
although the expected production from 1 g. of meat is 16-8 larvae, it requires nearly three
times this number in the original population to achieve this result.

Larvae tend to congregate in more or less large, densely packed groups under the meat.
A certain proportion of the individuals tends to be crowded out and pushed away from the
food, particularly where there is a high larval density. Such individuals probably succumb
later, even though sufficient food remains to enable them to complete their development.
Except at very high initial densities, where practically the whole of the underside of the
meat is occupied, there is always an appreciable residue of food after the majority of the
larvae have pupated. In addition, very small larvae, which have never developed far, are
to be observed. These larvae never survive to pupate.
