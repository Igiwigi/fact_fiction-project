; practically vanishes, therefore, for normal incidence and for tangential drift.

Further, as regards the change of width of the beam or distance between the rays,

is apparent that measured along the wave-surface it is the same, because

= A’B’ = AB;; so measured perpendicularly it changes in the ratio of cos € : cos €

68. It is not to be supposed that the ray is reflected after this manner ; and, in fact,
shall find that the error of ray-reflexion, or difference between angle of incidence
reflexion, 1 — 7’, is exceedingly small. :
To determine this difference, and the whole circumstances of the problem, we write
