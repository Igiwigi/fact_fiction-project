The second ether mentioned above boiled between 215 and 220 C.; it was decom-. posed by alcoholic potash; the potash-salt 80 obtained, heated with dilute sulphuric
acid, yielded to ether an oily acid posscssing the characteristic odour of caproic acid. This acid, boiled with argentic carbonate snspended in water, gave on filtration magnificent,
nacreous plates of a silver-salt which were very sparingly soluble in water, only slightly
acted upon by light, in fact possessing all the properties of normal silyer caproate,.
and differing markedly from the isomeric silver diethacetate recently described by us*.,
Submitted to analysis this salt yielded the following reults :â€”

1517 grm. gave 1776 grm. carbonic anhydride, :0685 grm.
