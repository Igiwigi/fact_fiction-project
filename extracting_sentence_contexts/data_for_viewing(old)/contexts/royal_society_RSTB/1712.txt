some of the others. In fig. 1, Plate 21, a transverse section of another stem from an
entirely new specimen is shown, the preservation of which is remarkably complete. _

The middle of the central cylinder is occupied by a solid parenchymatous pith,
imbedded in which are groups of dark sclerotic cells. At the periphery of the pith
there are several distinct strands of primary xylem. Two of these, from the same
specimen as photograph 1, are shown on a larger scale in Plate 21, figs. 2 and 8. —
Beyond the primary strands of xylem, we come to a broad zone of secondary wood, the
elements of which are arranged with great regularity in radial rows. This secondary
wood is divided up by numerous medullary rays, both primary and secondary.

[f any doubt could be entertained as to the mode of development of the woody zone,
it is removed by the fact that at its outer limit the cambium itself is often preserved
in great perfection (see Plate 22, fig. 7).

On its outer side the cambiumn is continuous with a zone of thin-walled tissue,
which is made up of phloém-groups, separated from one another by the phloém-rays. —
The greater part of this layer is secondary, as is shown by the radial seriation of its
elements. On its external border, however, the primary phloém-groups can still some~
times be recognized (see Plate 21, fig. 1, and Plate 22, fig. 7, ph.). The phloém-zone is
again surrounded by a ring of thin-walled tissue, which is best regarded as a pericycle
(see Plate 22, figs. 5, 6, and 7). Imbedded in this we find groups of the same some-
what sclerotic cells, which are so conspicuous in the pith. At the exterior of the
pericycle there is usually a layer of periderm.
