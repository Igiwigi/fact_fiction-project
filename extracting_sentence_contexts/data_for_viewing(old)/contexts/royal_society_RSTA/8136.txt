Fic. 7.—Carbon Monoxide-Hydrogen. p — # Isotherm at —185° C,

point of contact is situated (very approximately) at 55 atmospheres, the mixture
containing 10 per cent. CO.

A large number of measurements were made at —200° C., but owing to the fact that
the great expansion in the loop at that temperature was not realised, search was made


THE TERNARY SYSTEM CARBON MONOXIDE-NITROGEN-HYDROGEN. 205

for the border curve in an impossible region. Two points on the p — x loop were
however, determined, and these are of interest in connection with the results obtained
by the entirely different analytical method, to be discussed next. They were :-—

90 percent. CO... = = ne 62-5 atmospheres.
10 per cent. CO... Me ms ne 8-0 atmospheres.
