Many of these neurons also participate in the generation of 5 25

or saccade neurons for small vectors (i.e. microsaccades), or SRT (ms)

in fact whether these neurons could subserve both functions. The complex nature of what fixation entails is reviewed else- Figure 4. Cumulative distributions of reaction times for correct anti-saccades
