but I suspect that one or more of the late Upper Pleistocene lavas overlie them both,
The interpretation of the Sirima Gorge section seems to supply the following sequence
of events for this region.

At the time of the formation of the Rudolf Basin (Pliocene) the 1500 ft. scarp bound-
ing the south-west shore of the lake was formed and at the same time faults (5 and 6 in
section) probably occurred along the south-eastern shores in the Sirima region.
To-day these are not visible, but are inferred from the fact that the Basement Complex
east and south of Kulal disappears beneath a thin covering of lavas some 3 or 4 miles
east of Sirima, and does not reappear anywhere between that point and the lake.
This is so in spite of the ground-level falling a thousand feet or more within a distance
of less than 12 miles. In any case unless it had been let down by fractures one must
surely have found the Basement Complex in the deep cut of the Sirima Gorge, yet there
is no sign of it throughout its whole course.

There is at present no evidence to show the age of the basalts that lie directly upon
the Basement schists in this area; it is possible that they are Miocene and pre-date the
first faulting, or that they are of early Pleistocene age. Whatever their age, by Middle
Pleistocene times lavas covered the Basement Complex, and it was upon them that the
Sirima lake bed was deposited. That it was a shoreline deposit is shown by the great
