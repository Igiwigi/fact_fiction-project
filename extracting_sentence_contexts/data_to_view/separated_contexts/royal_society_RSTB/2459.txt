I have examined a large number of different Dogs, and have come to the conclusion
that they will require a monograph to themselves. HArcKEL seems to be right in
deriving the domestic Dogs from the Wolves and Jackals. In fact, all the Dogs
which have come under my notice, with the sole exception of the Racoon-like Dog
(Canis procyonides), have the round pupils characteristic of the Wolves and Jackals in
distinction to the Foxes. The Chou-Chou Dog of the Chinese is remarkable in
having a brilliant orange-red fundus with a black peripheral zone covered with bluish
pigment patches, a fundus unlike any of the other Carnivora. The fundus of the Cape Hunting Dog (Lycaon pictus) closely resembles that of the
Hyeenidee, and in this respect differs from all other Canide.
