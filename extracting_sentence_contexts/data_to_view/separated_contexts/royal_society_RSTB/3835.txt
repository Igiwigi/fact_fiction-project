Previously it has been explained that both Crateraster quinqueloba, var. depressus (p. 121), and Metopaster quadratus, var. parvus (p. 117), may be true
saltations. These saltations, however, are lost sight of after a racial life of com-
paratively short duration,

Correlation of Variations.â€”Vhe fact that variation is continuous is the main cause
of difficulty to the field geologist who wishes to determine zonal horizons, for, unless
a fair amount of material be obtained, it is frequently far from easy to decide
whether the specimens are truly typical of the horizon. Fortunately, some species possess a number of diverse characters which, although
each fluctuates about a mean, do not show marked correlation in their variability. Thus ossicles of Metopaster tumidus and M. mammillatus are especially valuable
as zonal guides, for they are not only abundant but also possess four imperfectly
correlated characters, namely, height, size, and frequency of spine pits, and prominent
tumidities.
