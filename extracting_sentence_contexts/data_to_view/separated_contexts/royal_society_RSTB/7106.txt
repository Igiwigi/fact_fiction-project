But it seems probable that the residual blastoderm has developed according
to its presumptive fate; while the reversed-piece has failed to differentiate and in so doing
has been responsible for the defect in the embryo at the time of fixation. Such a failure is
reminiscent of the undifferentiated tissue sometimes found in an otherwise normal axis,
referred to in the description of partial regulation. It may seem surprising that the reversed-
piece can be responsible for the undifferentiated mid-line in spite of the fact that in the
stage and perhaps in the LM stage blastoderms it can hardly have contained the presump-
tive notochord and neural plate subsequently missing. But slow healing, which was
observed in these specimens, may have resulted in the reversed-piece occupying the
position of the primitive node at the time of the backward movement. From such a position
it perhaps underwent the tissue movement of node material but not the tissue differentia-
tion.
