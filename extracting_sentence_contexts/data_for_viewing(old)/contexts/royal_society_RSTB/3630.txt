fibres correspond to the chorda dorsalis in position and relations. Later (1876,
p. 202), however, he withdrew this interpretation,* for he had then discovered, in
the growing tail of Nis, the mesoblastic “chorda cells,” which he regarded as
forming a sort of axis corresponding in position and function to the chorda of
Vertebrates (pp. 168, 169). These “chorda cells” have, of course, no connection
whatever with the giant fibres (see RANDoLPH, 1892).

CUNNINGHAM (1885, p. 12) “got back... . to the old idea of the homology of
the notochord and the three giant fibres beneath} the nerve cord in the earthworm,”
and Perrter (1881, pp. 228, 229) remarked that the three longitudinal cords of
Pontodrilus recall, by their position, the chorda of Vertebrates.

The connection of the giant fibres with undoubted nerve cells and the fact that
they contain typical neurofibrille are sufficient to dispose of the idea that these fibres

have any homology whatever with the notochord of Vertebrates,

with THE NorocHoRD oF VERTEBRATES.

Vespovsky regarded the giant fibre in Rhynchelmis (1876, p. 340) as a hollow
central axis{ separating the two halves of the nerve cord, and that of Tomopteris
(1878, p. 88) as a medullary canal representing the remains of a groove of
invagination of the ectoderm, but in 1879 he pronounced the giant fibres of
Enchytraus to be tubes of a cartilaginous substance, but did not adduce any
