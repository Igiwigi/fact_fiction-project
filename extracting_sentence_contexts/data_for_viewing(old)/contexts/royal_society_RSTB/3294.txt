on the elements of the stem-wood. The newly-formed elements are spiral or
reticulate. Tison notes that the rupture of the tracheids takes place gradually
during the year; he did not observe the successive step-like gaps observed by the
German author. A tangential section of the stem-wood in the region of a leaf-trace
shows thick-walled, medullary-ray cells lying above tracheids which decrease in
diameter from below upwards.

The leaf-traces of Agathis obtusa described by Tison pursue an almost vertical
course through the cortex; the numerous strands from the leaf-lamina fuse in pairs
and are finally reduced to two bundles which enter the stem cylinder 6-7 centims.
below the level of the leaf-insertion, The branches examined were not more than
five years old, and in these no actual rupture of the elements was observed nor were
any new elements (‘‘tissus de raceard”) added. The fact that no break occurs in
this species during four to five years is, as T1son says, due to the obliquely vertical
course of the trace as it passes through the wood, a circumstance which means that
the increasing diameter of the stem exerts a pressure which is lateral rather than
vertical.

ON THE ARAUCARIEA, RECENT AND EXTINCT. 353

Tn Araucaria imbricata and A. brasiliensis the traces are also oblique in their course,
but less so than in Agathis obtusa, T1son speaks of Araucaria as exhibiting an
