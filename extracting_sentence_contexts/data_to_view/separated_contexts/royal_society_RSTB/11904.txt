Con-
sistent with this view, the gene encoding this protein, now
known as p53, could act as an oncogene (e.g. [75]). However,
after some twists and turns, it became evident that p53
instead usually acts as a tumour suppressor [76-78]. In
fact, more than half of all human cancers harbour inactivating
or dominant-negative mutations in p53. As was the case for
RB, oncoproteins from multiple DNA tumour virus families
bind and inactivate p53. In addition to large T antigen,
adenovirus E1B and E4orf6 and high-risk HPV E6 also

neutralize p53 function to support transformation and tumor-
igenesis [79-81].
