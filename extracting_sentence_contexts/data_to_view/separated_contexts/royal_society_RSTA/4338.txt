The value obtained for the cubical expansion of potassium sulphate for 100°
was 0°0126, and for rubidium sulphate 0°0111. The latter value is extraordinarily
near the truth according to the results now presented, the value for 0° to 100° being
actually 0°01108. But the impossibility of trusting this method, equally with all the
relatively coarser density methods, to afford correct differences between the values
for different salts, is clearly demonstrated by the fact that the difference shown
between the values for the potassium and rubidium salts, namely 0°00150, is seventeen
times as great as the real difference (‘01117—0°01108 = 0°00009), which is now shown
to exist. SuMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS. The principal results of the investigation are presented in the following summary.
