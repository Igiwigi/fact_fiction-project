of the solid products (the next lowest proportion being
nearly double that amount), it can scarcely be assxumed that M. BerrueLor's firs arrangement of
reactions can represent any but a most exceptional result. Again, the acceptance of his arrangement of
four equations in the proportions he indicates as accounting for the formation of the chief.products when
the sulphate amounts to 12 or 14 per cent. of the total constituents, involves the aszumption that a some-
what considerable proportion of charcoal shonld remain unoxidised ; in fact, nearly 2:5 per cent. of
carbon should be found in the residue.
