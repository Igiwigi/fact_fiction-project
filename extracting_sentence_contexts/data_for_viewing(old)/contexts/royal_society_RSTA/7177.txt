(ii) Comparison of self-heating thresholds with experimental data for initiators

Comparison may be made with the experimental threshold temperatures for the detona-
tion of various masses, which are plotted in figures 23 and 24 for both loose and pressed
initiators.

It will be seen that in the case of lead azide, the threshold for large masses, agrees with the
self-heating curve. The exact agreement must to some extent be regarded as fortuitous, until
thermal conductivity data are available. But the fact that for large masses the experimental
curve assumes the same slope as the self-heating curve suggests that this mechanism of
detonation takes over when the amount of initiator is large. On the other hand, for small
