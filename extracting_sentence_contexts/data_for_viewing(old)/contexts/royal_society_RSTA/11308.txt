Although in these sunlight experiments no nuclei, requiring only slight super-
saturation to make condensation take place on them, have been produced, they do not

absolutely prove that such nuclei may not be formed by sunlight even in the lower
layers of the atmosphere. For it is quite possible that the disappearance of the
nuclei produced by weak ultra-violet light, when they are left to themselves, is
entirely due to the fact that they very quickly reach the walls of the vessel by
diffusion on account of their small size. The time for which they persist would then
entirely depend on the size of the vessel containing them. Now the explanation of
the fact, that with weak radiation they never grow sufficiently to be caught by slight
expansions, may simply be that they reach the walls before any considerable growth
has time to take place. In the atmosphere, according to this view they would persist
S for an almost indefinite time, and might finally become large enough to act like
S “dust” particles in helping condensation.
‘¢_ In the preliminary note already published* it was pointed out that in the upper
Zregions of the atmosphere sunlight was likely to be rich in ultra-violet rays, and it
2 was suggested that from their action on air and water vapour alone the small
a particles, to which the blue colour of the sky is due, might arise. TyNDALLt recog-
£nised the resemblance between the light of the sky and that scattered by the fogs
= which he obtained by the action of light on various vapours, pointing out that the
Dlicht scattered by the fogs is polarised like that of the sky. He concluded that the
ca blue colour of the sky was due to the presence of small particles like those produced
