It is very true, that hydrogen, in its nascent state, may have
properties with which we are yet unacquainted; and may
determine combinations, which it can in no other state produce. But the decomposition of water, in the first instance, in order
that a new recomposition may, at that moment, be effected by
the same agents, is in itself sufficiently paradoxical. The facts last mentioned, are s0mewhat analogous to, and
seem even confirmative. of, a theory proposed some time past
by Mrs. FuLnuame; but I shall withhold my full assent, both
to her explanation. and to any I could give, until these evident
contradictions can in some way be further elucidated.
