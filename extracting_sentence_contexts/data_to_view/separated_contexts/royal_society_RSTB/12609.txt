Editing of chloroplast RNA was analysed and calculated
according to a published protocol [17] with modifications, by
sequencing the purified (QlAquick, Qiagen) PCR-amplified pro-
ducts generated using high-fidelity DNA Polymerase (Phusion,
Thermo Scientific) and modified PCR conditions (98°C for
3 min, (98°C for 30s, 52°C for 45s, 72°C for 1 min) x 33 cycles
and 72°C for 5 min) from three independent cDNA templates.
