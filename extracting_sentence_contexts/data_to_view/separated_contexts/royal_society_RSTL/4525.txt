For it must be observed that this experiment of the different edges
and surfaces, plane and curve, having precisely the same action, is identical with the
former experiment of two edges heing placed one behind the other, and the second
producing no effect if placed on the same side of the ray with the first edge. These
two edges are exactly like two snccessive particles of the same surface near to which
the rays pass. Consequently the two experiments are not similar but identical ; and
thus the known fact of the edge and the back of a razor making the same fringes,
proves the polarization of the rays on one side. Thus the proposition is proved as to
polarization. Exp. 3.
