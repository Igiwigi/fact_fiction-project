Of the various species of this genus referred to above, three are described as occurring
in the leaves of species of Ranunculus. One of these—Hutyloma ranunculi—appears
to be extremely common in some places, and has a wide distribution ; its resting-spores
have often been described, and it is regarded by all the authorities as a well-marked
species. It has, however, so far as I know, not been specially investigated in detail,
and, in addition to the other facts contained in the following memoir, it is of interest
to have observed the germination of the conidia for the first time; the infection
experiments are also new, and consequently important, and they establish beyond
doubt the relations of the conidia to the Hntyloma. *

I now proceed to the description of my own observations, the completion of which
has been rendered possible by an outbreak of the disease which the fungus induces on
a large patch of densely crowded plants of Ranunculus Ficaria during the spring and
early summer of this year; this patch of diseased plants was so favourably situated,
and the fungus spread so rapidly and in such enormous numbers on it, that I was
enabled to observe and record some facts of considerable interest respecting the origin
and spread of the epidemic due to the action of the parasite. Moreover, material was
to hand in abundance and in excellent condition, and the circumstances were so
fortunate that it was possible to note day by day the symptoms of the disease, and
the progress, climax, and decline of the epidemic.
