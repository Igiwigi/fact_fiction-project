ATxIxs, to whom I take
this opportunity of expressing my thanks for her kindness and liberality in
allowing me to examine the numerous dissected shells in her collection. In those Volates which retain the nucleus (or that: form which the shell has
when first hatched,) that part, which was originally very thin and brittle, is
gpeedily filled up with the deposit in question. In fact, all shells whose spires
are exposed, and, being thin in their young state, would be liable to be broken
off by the action of the sea, have that part strengthened by the internal deposi-
tion of calcareous matter.

'The distinction between these and the decollated shells, such as Bulimus
decollatus, Cerithium decollatum, &c., is, that in the latter, the animal, instead
of lining the upper whorls with an internal coat, snddenly withdraws its body
from them and forms behind its extremity a concave septum ; and the vital
communication between the body and the apex of the shell being thus cut
off, the latter part decays, in the manner of a dead $hell, and falls off in par-
ticles*,

The greatest development of the deposit mentioned above is to be observed
in the genus Magilus, in which the young shell is very thin, shaped like a
Purpura and of a crystalline texture; but when the animal has attained its full
8ize, and has formed for itself a lodgement in a coral, the greater part of the
cavity of its shell is filled with a glassy su√æstance, leaving only a small conical
space for the reception of its body: layer after layer of this substance are then
deposited in rapid succession, in order to keep the body of the animal on a

shell becoming filled with a very brittle glassy depoxit.

level with the top of the growing coral in which it is buried, until its shell is
almost lost in the quantity of glassy matter subsequently formed. The $hells of the prismatic crystalline structure exhibit, when broken, a
quantity of short fibres perpendicular to the surface : when examined, these are
found to be mostly hexagonal prisms, with a few smaller polyhedral prisms in-
terposed.
