On consulting the fourth, fifth, and 8ixth columns of Table XXVI., it will be
obseryed that the increase of resistance ensuing from magnetization depends not only
upon the magnetism induced, but also upon the magnetizing force itself; and, in fact,
we may say that if y denotes the increase of resistance, whilst « and Þ represent the
magnetizing forces and the magnetism induced respectively, y=a.«+b.Þ, where a, b
are two constants. In the case of the nickel wire, « and Þ were measured in terms of
the divisions of the scale of the tangent galyanometer, and of the scale of the THoMs0N's
reflecting galvanometer respectively ; whilst a and b were calculated from the observa-
tious made with a=279 and a=86, The agreement between the observed and
calculated values of y is good, and certainly quite equal to that between the different
obgervations made with the same values of «. Columns 4 and 5 &how clearly that the
alteration of resistance depends in this cage more on the value of the magnetizing force

than on the magnetism induced, and from the fact that 7 is nearly constant throughout,
AX
whereas 5 rapidly increases for the higher values of «, we are led to infer that the

alteration of resistance would go on increasing as the magnetizing force increased, even

when there might be no appreciable advance in the value of the magnetism induced. A glance at the curves in Table XXVII. will serve to confirm the above view. These curves have their absciss representing both the induced magnetism and the

alterations of resistance produced by the various magnetizing forces, which latter are

measured by the ordinates of the curves.
