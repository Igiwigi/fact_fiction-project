Hither of the
following explanations seems to offer a possible solution of the difficulty, but there is at

present no conclusive experimental evidence as to whether either is correct :—

(1) In common with some other types of fermentation, as shown for the latter by
Nevusere and his co-workers, acetaldehyde may be produced by the fungus from
the carbon source supplied whether this be a poly-, di-, or monosaccharide, a
pentose, or a polyhydric alcohol. The acetaldehyde may then be condensed by
a series of reactions to kojic acid. This explanation is apparently supported by
the fact that it has been shown that all those fungi which produce kojic acid also
produce at the same time ethyl alcohol, and hence, in passing, acetaldehyde.

(2) The source of carbon supplied, whatever its nature, may be first anabolised by
the fungus into a reserve carbohydrate, which is later hydrolysed by the micro-
organism, as occasion arises, into a monosaccharose which in its turn gives rise to
kojic acid. The close similarity between the amylene oxide form of a 6-carbon
sugar, and kojic acid

renders this a probable explanation, and it is further supported by the fact that
various fungi are known to store reserve carbohydrates and utilise them later as
occasion demands, e.g., glycogen in yeast, trehalose in A. niger.
