Why is it that results of death can be accom-
modated into complex verbal concepts when other types of
results fail to do so? Iâ€™ll address each of these in turn.

(a) Complementarity of assertions

Considering the implications of manner of death verbs as coun-
terexamples to manner/result complementarity, one tempting
avenue is to abandon any hard grammatical constraint on
verbal concepts. However, the fact that the manner and result
components of manner of death verbs reside on different levels
of meaning suggests an alternative pathway. Complementarity
may be a hard constraint after all, but perhaps it is a constraint
only on certain levels of meanings. Widening our view somewhat, manner of death verbs are not
the only verbs that have some kind of complex verbal concept.
