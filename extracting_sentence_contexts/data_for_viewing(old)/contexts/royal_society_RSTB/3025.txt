have by no means the finality usually ascribed to them. Further, there is no
disputing the fact that the leaves may exercise an osmotic suction upon the water in

the vessels, which will be proportional to the difference of concentration in the two
cases, less the minimum amount required to maintain turgidity in the leaf (over three
atmospheres). Owing to the high breaking strain of water, a tension of five
atmospheres can be transmitted through the vessels as long as they contain no
bubbles larger than 0°00005 centim. diameter (surface-tension pressure = 54
atmospheres), This would theoretically suttice to raise water to a height of 180 feet,
but in the wood of a tree, owing to the internal friction which has to be overcome, and
owing to the rapid appearance of large bubbles in actively functioning vessels, less
than one-third of this force would be available for raising the water, even when the
rate of flow was slow. As a matter of fact, we have seen that the greatest
differences between the minimal osmotic pressures of leaves at different levels,
approximated to two atmospheres. The temporary restoration of the conductivity of
dead wood by injection with water, is partly the result of providing supplies of water
close at hand, and is partly due to the removal of air enabling the osmotic suction of
the transpiring leaves to be transmitted further down the stem, and also lessening the
resistance to flow. As bubbles appear in the vessels, the conductivity is rapidly lost
