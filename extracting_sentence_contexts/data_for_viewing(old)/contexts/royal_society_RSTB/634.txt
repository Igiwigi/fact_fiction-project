of the cord, and then are mingled together, so that the degeneration from a lesion of
the lower part of the cord is not dense. ‘This tract has recentsy been found by
BEcHTEREW to undergo development at a different period from the rest of the lateral
column. It is almost certainly a sensory tract, and physiological facts seem to show
that its fibres are connected with the posterior roots of the opposite side.”

Go.t’s column is the other long ascending tract. Most observers are agreed that it
is made up of fibres of the posterior roots which pass into the posterior column of the
same side, tend towards the mid line to form the posterior median column, and do not
reach their end station until they arrive at the nucleus of the funiculus gracilis of the
medulla. Section of the roots of the cauda equina in Monkeys showed only degenera-
tion of fibres of the same side—vide my article on “ The Bipolar Cells of the Spinal
Cord,” ‘Brain,’ Part IV., 1890. Toor and Srycer’s experiments (loc. cit.) support this
view. It is probable that sensations passing along these fibres, having reached the
nucleus in the medulla, decussate to the opposite side by the fibres of the fillet.
