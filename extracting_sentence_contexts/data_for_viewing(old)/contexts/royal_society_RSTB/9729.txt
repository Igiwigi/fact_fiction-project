Internal and external warfare among small-scale hunter—
gatherer groups arguably resembles coalitionary aggression in
chimpanzees [1] and to the extent that this indicates an ancestral
adaptive problem, the OT mediated in-group /out-group psy-
chology described above [68] might reflect shared adaptations
for coalitional aggression among humans and. chimpanzees.
However, in the past 8000 years shifts to more defensible
resources such as livestock or agricultural land have led to
increases in the frequency, scale and intensity of warfare [8].
In this context, culturally evolving mechanisms for co-opting
the parochial effects of OT could have been crucial for success
in warfare [69-71]; for instance, the creation of stable coopera-
tive units with fictive kinship categories (‘brothers in arms’)
could perhaps amplify in-group loyalty and xenophobia,
while the rigid hierarchies and systems of reward and punish-
ment typical of successful armies might be partly based on
hormonal mechanisms for dominance and subordination

Males in poor condition cannot maintain high levels of
testosterone; illness and injury lead to rapid decreases in tes-
tosterone [88-90], as does short and longer term fasting
[91,92], and extensive energetic expenditure [93]. While
some human and chimpanzee populations show no seasonal
variation in testosterone [94,95], large studies of subsistence
human and wild baboon populations report decreases in tes-
