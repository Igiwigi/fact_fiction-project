These
openings appear to be of the same character as the opening within the bright stars
of the trapezium of Orion, the stars being at the edges of the opening. Had the
stars been situated all together within the openings, the suspicion would perhaps
have suggested itself more strongly that the nebula had been absorbed by the stars. As it is, I think we can hardly fail to conclude that the nebula is in some way con-
nected with these bright stars, in fact that they are equidistant, and therefore, if the
inquiries about parallax, now proceeding with so much activity, should result in
giving us the distances of these bright stars, we shall have the distance of this nebula. The long elliptic or lenticular nebulz are very numerous; I have given three sketches
of remarkable objects of this class: the appearance of Plate XXXVII, fig. 7 suggests
the idea of an elliptic annular system seen very obliquely. A series of very elliptic
Shells enveloping the nucleus, seen somewhat obliquely, would perhaps also present
the same aspect.
