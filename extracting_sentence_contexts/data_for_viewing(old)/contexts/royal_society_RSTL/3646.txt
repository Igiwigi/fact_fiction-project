most earnest truth-loving students. 'DThe papers, as left by their author, and com-
mitted to me by his father, contained little more than a record of the observations.
I have arranged them to illustrate certain general facts, and have added some of the
conelusions which they plainly indicate. I have felt the more justified in making
these additions, by the belief that my intimate friendship with Mr. BaxLow would
enable me to write what he would have written, had his life been spared. And in

Natural respiratory movements of the Dragon-fly (Libellula).

From nearly all the following observations it may be gathered that these move-
ments constantly vary, in both rate and force. Volition and emotions, changes of
temperature and of light, account for many of these differences; and it might have
been inferred that, on these disturbing causes being removed, there would be a great
