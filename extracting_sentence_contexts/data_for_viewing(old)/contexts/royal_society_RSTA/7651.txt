shock were surface waves.
Although it is certain that effects of this kind must influence the results, in the case
of most of the shocks it is possible to estimate the position of the epicentre without

* The large amplitude recorded by the Wiechert seismograph in the case of this distant shock is
probably to be associated with the fact that the mean period of the recorded earth movements is
much greater than in the case of the more local shocks, and that the natural period of the seismograph
at this time was 2-0 sec. as compared with 0-6 sec. for the Jaggar shock recorders,

appealing to such considerations in interpreting the amplitude patterns. â€˜The results
derived from the method were briefly described in the preliminary report. It was
there pointed out that the final allocation of suggested foci was more likely to be free
from serious error as a result of the fact that certain relationships should exist between
the patterns corresponding to different suggested foci. The whole complex of suggested
foci must in fact satisfy the condition that there is no sudden change in the amplitude
