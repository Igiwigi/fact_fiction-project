Finally, we proved that the same resonance phenomenon may be used to produce interwell
oscillations for t values inside Regions II and V, for which the oscillations are bounded to one well,
even without dissipation. The forcing amplitude, in these cases, needs to be of a bigger magnitude
to induce the intrawell oscillations. Moreover, the forcing amplitude plays, again, a key role in
the system sensitivity to the forcing frequency for Region IL In fact, we have found a threshold
value of the forcing amplitude, namely F!! ~ 5. For smaller values of the forcing amplitude, the
system resonates for 2 = 1. While for values of F higher than F!!, the resonance frequency is 2 = 2.
