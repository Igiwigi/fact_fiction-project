in an antero-posterior direction. It ought, however, to be mentioned that the four outer
layers of the bladder split up or bifurcate at the cervix, the one half going to the exter-
nal or outer half of the urethra, the other to the prostate. "There is consequently no
portion of the bladder, urethra, or. prostate in which longitudinal, slightly oblique,
oblique, and very oblique or circular fibres may not be found.

The longitudinal fibres of the prostate and urethra are separated by a considerable
interval, and the very oblique or circular fibres, which are widely distinct and have
Separate axes at the cervix where the sphincter is most fully developed, curve into and
are blended with each other in the region of the verumontanum. This is important, as it
shows how the sphincter may act independently of the prostate, and the reverse.

The very oblique or circular fibres have been specially described from the fact of their
entering largely into the formation of the bladder, urethra, and prostate, and because
they are principally concerned in the formation of the sphincter.

The sphincter vesicz, the existence of which has been doubted, is composed of an
anterior and posterior set of oblique and yery oblique or circular fibres which is largely
developed, and by a right and left lateral set which is accessory and less fully developed.

The fibres of the sphincter are continuous with the oblique and very oblique spiral
fibres of the urethra and bladder generally, and this circumstance, more than any other,
has induced anatomists to deny its presence. As well, however, might we argue against
the existence of a sphincter in the stomach or rectum, for in both of those cases, as is
well known, there is continuity of structure. The fibres of the trigone are similarly
