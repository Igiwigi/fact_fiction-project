This is like the tensor product architecture semantic constraints on the types of scenario that will be

suggested by Smolensky [63]. A vector for dog is convolved simulated. In fact, much of the work in linguistics on compo-

with a vector for agent so as to form a representation of dog- sitional semantics is focused on pinning down these

as-agent. The identity of the agent (dog) can be extracted from constraints (in the case of language comprehension). Syntax

the convolution and decompressed.
