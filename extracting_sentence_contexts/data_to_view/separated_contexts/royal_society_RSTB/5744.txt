The cestrous uterus obtained from No. 283, shot just after mating, weighed 1-1 gm. ;
it contained spermatozoa and was distended with fluid so that the wall was far thinner
than in the preceding specimens. (Fig. 13, Plate 10.) Owing to the fact that it was
not fixed till 15 hours after death a detailed histological description is not possible. The distended epithelium is not quite so high as in No. 87, but it averages about
40 Â» (assuming it to be unaffected by post-mortem changes). The epithelial cells
seem to be actively secreting.
