In both cases his dose is lower than ours. Both he and
we find the dose for the rabbit lower than that for the rat. As to the latter fact, it
is partly explainable by the difficulty of getting the rabbit weighed food-free, and
this, obviously, would raise its apparent weight and so lower the apparent M.L.D. This difficulty is not so great with the rat, whose real weight can be got fairly nearly
after 24 hoursâ€™ starvation, especially as this animal always micturates when handled. Rogers collected his venom by getting the snakes to bite through indiarubber
sheeting ; ours was obtained by expression from the dissected glands.
