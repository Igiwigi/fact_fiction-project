form, in the stiffened media.
~ At length I obtained some very puzzling results, shown in figs. 1-4, Plate 14.
When first observed, I supposed that this was a pathological phenomenon ; but it
has now been followed so often and so closely, that my explanation of it may probably
be accepted as the true one.

In the cases referred to, the rod-like Schizomycete either escapes altogether from
its gelatinous investment (fig. 2, Plate 14); or, more frequently, it does so partially
only, and goes on adding to the sheath as it travels forward (see figs. 1 and 4,
Plate 14).

This process of partial or total emergence of the Schizomycete proper, from its
gelatinous investment, is not only a curious fact in itself, but it is connected so closely
with the conditions of the environment, that it may be taken as an indication on the
part of the organism that some change has occurred in the surroundings.

This may be fairly concluded from the observations that so long as the conditions
in the hanging-drop are favourable, the organism remains in the sheath, and grows
symmetrically in it; moreover, it does this very generally in the fermentations carried
on in soda-water flasks, whereas any interference with the medium induces the
unequal growth just referred to.

I found that if I simply transfer a drop from such a fermentation to a cover-slip,
and use it as a hanging-drop, the sheathed organisms behave as above describedâ€”
the rodlets, &c., merely escape from the sheaths, and become isolated, naked filaments,
