The g and & are evaluated from experimental scaling of structure functions ¢(q) (see, for
example, figure 12) by the wavelet transform modulus maxima method procedure [26] which
allows the scaling ¢(q) estimation up to q=9 by using of approximately 50000 data points.
Experimental data should be tested by scalings (4.5) and (4.6) for choosing either g or gy that
is the closest to 3.

The time dependence of the coefficients g and gy for the same example, which is shown in
figure 9, can be seen in figure 13. The values of g ~ 2.3-2.6, whereas gy ~ 2.7-3, i.e. the values of
gy are close to 3. So, it can be interpreted that filament-like structures dominate in the process. It
can also be proved by statistical analysis of all 209 selected intervals (figure 14), which presents
the distributions of g (figure 14a) and gr (figure 14b). The mean values of these parameters for the
distributions shown in figure 14 are (g) = 2.4 and ( (Sf) = 2.8. This fact is in a good agreement with
the ‘flux tubes’ approach to the SW structure [69,70]. Apparently, filamentary structures are the
most stable and, therefore, could dominate in the dynamics of SW turbulence.
