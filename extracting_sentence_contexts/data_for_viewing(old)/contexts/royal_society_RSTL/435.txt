Sir Bexjamm Trnomeson's Experiments, &c, 49

The route which I have followed in this inquiry is that which
I thought bid fairest to lead to useful discoveries. Without em-
barrassing myself with any particular theory, I have formed to
myself a plan of experimental investigation, which I conceived
would conduct me to the knowledge of certain facts, of which
we are now ignorant, or very imperfectly informed, and with
which it is of consequence that we should be made acquainted,

To this end I began by determining by actual experiment
the relative conducting powers of various bodies of very diffe-
