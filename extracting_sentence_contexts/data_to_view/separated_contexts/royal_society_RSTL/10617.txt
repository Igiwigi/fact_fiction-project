A
chloroformic solution of the yellow residue showed three distinct bands, two of which
read : 18t, X 501 to A 481; 2nd, A 467 to \ 451 (?). A bisulphide of carbon s0Jution
showed only two distinct bands : 1st, X 5215 to x 4985; 2nd, A 488 to A 470. An attempt to obtain the needle-shaped erystals of chlorophyll yellow only partially
Succeeded,

* It is a remarkable fact that the decompoxability of vegetable chlorophyll differs very much in
