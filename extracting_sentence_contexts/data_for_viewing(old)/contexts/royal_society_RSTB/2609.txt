Considered vertically, however, the series of granulations is interrupted at the
peripheral and inner areas of the septum by irregularly-shaped pores. We may look
upon the series of granulations as the superficial form assumed by a successive series
of growth-parts belonging to a large trabecula. The irregular shape of the septal
pores in Hupsammia is due to the fact that the growth-parts of one trabecula may be
disconnected, and also the growth-parts of adjacent trabecule, When the spaces
thus left run into one another, naturally irregular pores arise. Moreover, since the
secondary outfilling has no definite relation to the structure, the original pores may,
in the course of time, be irregularly diminished in size.

New trabecule are inserted at the periphery, and a distinct area of divergence
is there observed (a.d. fig. 50). In Hupsammia, however, there is not simply the
divergence of one septal and one costal trabecula; but a definite fan-group of
trabecule is formed at each new growth-period. The new trabecular parts are
placed alternately between those of the foregoing growth-period, and two or three
new trabecule take origin at the “ keystone” part of the arch.
