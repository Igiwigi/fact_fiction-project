one can collect together the terms 1 of given degree and get

Artin used quadratic reciprocity to show that

Yo xn) =0, fred, (1.12)
nmonic
deg n=r
so that L(s, xp) is a polynomial in q~* of degree < d — 1, and in fact of degree d — 1 by means of
the functional equation, also proved by Artin, described below.
To prove (1.12), one can use the fact that the sum of (n|D) over a complete set of residue classes
n modulo D is 0. Note that on applying quadratic reciprocity, each xp(n) = +(n|D). For fixed D
and fixed degn, with n monic, each application of quadratic reciprocity has, by (1.5), the same
+1 factor. And, when r >, 1 runs over q’~“ copies of a complete set of residue classes modulo
D, which can be seen by writing 1 = g(x)D(x) + h(x), with degh <d or h=0, and degg=r—d,
g monic.

(b) Functional and ‘approximate’ functional equations

Artin also derived the functional equation for L(s, xp). It plays an important role in Andrade and
Keating’s heuristics leading to their moment conjecture, and also in allowing us to reduce the
