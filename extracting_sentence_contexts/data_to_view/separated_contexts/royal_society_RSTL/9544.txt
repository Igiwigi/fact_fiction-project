These experiments, which could be multiplied to any extent, show that, ph
rescence can be produced in tubes of all degrees of exhaust by sufficiently int a3
the violence of the negative discharge. But there is an experimental fact which has
been repeatedly observed and should be mentioned here, which shows that it is bw
essential that there should be any increased violence of the whole discharge, but that |
a sufficient intensification of the local action at the negative terminal is all that, is
necessary. When a tube is being exhausted to a high vacuum the phosphorescencs.
always appears firs in the neigbourhood of the negative terminal. But it often.
happens that one of the terminals of the tube is much smaller than the other.
