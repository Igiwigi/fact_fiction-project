Nevertheless the reaction differs
from that observed in the phosphorus-series. The bromide of the bromethylated phos-
phonium, as has been pointed out in a former part of this inquiry, is almost invariably
converted into an oxethylated body, its transformation into a vinyl-compound being
altogether exceptional. The bromide of the bromethylated arsonium, on the other hand,
yields, as a rule, the vinyl-body of the series, the formation of an oxethylated compound
taking place only under particular cireumstances; in fact s0 rarely as to leave some
doubt regarding the existence of this term of the series. The bromide of the brom-
ethylated arsonium, treated with an excess of oxide of silver, yields a powerfully alkaline
s0lution, the nature of which was determined by the analysis of the corresponding plati-
num-salt. Transformed into the chloride, and precipitated with dichloride of platinum,
this solution yielded beautiful rather soluble octohedra.
