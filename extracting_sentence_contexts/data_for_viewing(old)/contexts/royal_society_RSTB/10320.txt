remembered an actual stimulus. While this experiment seems
to show that we can understand cognition and behaviour as
divorced from the environment, it actually points to the value
of the IBH as a framework to understand what is happening.
Suppose the experiment attempted to recreate the pattern of
activity involved in an actual, reciprocal, social encounter. It
quickly becomes apparent that to do so would require
mimicking the other animal as a social stimulus. But as the
other animal responds to our experimental mouse, this is
not a fixed input, but rather a complex, time-varying input
embedded in causal loops with the very behaviour we wish
to experimentally control. Our surrogate ‘input pattern’
ends up being not only extremely complex, but in fact
cannot be specified in the absence of an analysis of the first
mouse as involved in a socially coupled interaction, which

itself can show emergent dynamical patterns that do not
reduce to the activity of the mice. This conclusion is conso-
nant with Cosmelli & Thompson’s suggestions about the
brain-in-a-vat thought experiment [18]. The upshot is that
we may be able to describe some aspects of cognition reason-
ably well as input-output transformations by the brain,
whereas others cannot be so described. Social cognition
typically may be of the latter kind.
