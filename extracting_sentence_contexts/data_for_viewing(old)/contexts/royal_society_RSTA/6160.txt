conditions, as first appreciated by Trautman [26]; coordinate transformations can move the energy
around like a bump under the carpet that can be flattened locally but not globally. This would
appear to rule out any interpretation of gravitational waves as fluctuations of a ‘gravitational’
aether.

This conclusion is supported by the ‘t Hooft-Susskind principle of holography that was
suggested by black-hole physics [27,28]. This states that the number of quantum gravitational
degrees of freedom in a given region grows as the area of the region’s boundary, but the number
of degrees of freedom associated with quantized fluctuations of a gravitational aether would
grow with the volume (by hypothesis, essentially) and these two growth rates are generally very
different; an exception is anti-de Sitter space-time because the volume of a ball in hyperbolic
space grows asymptotically and (in suitable units) at the same rate as the area of its boundary (a
fact that is essential for the applicability of the holographic principle in anti-de Sitter space-time
[29)).

Nothing said above implies the impossibility of a gravitational aether. An ‘Einstein-Aether’
modification of GR has been proposed [30], for phenomenological reasons reviewed in [31], but it
does not appear to arise from any larger framework such as string/M-theory that could provide
a consistent quantum theory. In other words, it may be in the ‘swampland’, which is the currently
popular term for phenomenological theories that have no ‘UV completion’; the topic was recently
reviewed in [32].
