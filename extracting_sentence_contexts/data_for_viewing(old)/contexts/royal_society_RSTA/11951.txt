has peculiarities of its own which are not shared with others, and we have nothing
corresponding to the homologous series of organic chemistry. It can hardly be
doubted that the success of physico-chemical methods of late years would have been
much less striking if inorganic bodies only had been available.

Amongst the carbon compounds we have many series of gases or vol
proceeding by regular increments of CH, to the molecule, the members of any one
series showing such striking similarities in their properties as to point to similarity
of constitution of the molecule. We have, too, the advantage of accurately deter-
mined graphic formulw, and though we are not justified in regarding these as concrete
representations of the molecule, yet the consistency with which the system of notation
has been applied to thousands of compounds shows that it has its basis in some
physical fact, and makes it well suited to serve as the “independent variable” in
expressing other properties as functions of the complexity of the molecule.

For these reasons I have chosen the paraffins and their monohalogen derivatives as
being simply related to each other, easily volatile, and stable.
