(2) that the complex trivalent negative ions have a much less powerful effect on the
eggs than have the simple trivalent positive ions. Whereas the presence of only
0°0001 mol. cerium ions increases the resistance of the eggs about 20 per cent.,
a corresponding decrease in resistance by citranion is only produced by a solution of
0-2 mol. sodium citrate. In other words, the complex anion is 20,000 times less
powerful than the simple kation.

It should be noticed that the decrease in the resistances of the eggs produced by
sodium citrate and by hypertonic solutions are not altogether identical phenomena.
In the presence of sodium citrate the resistance of the eggs attains a definite
equilibrium, which is completely reversible in certain cases. The decrease in the
resistance of eggs which is due to treatment with hypertonic solutions is not
reversible, and there is no evidence of any equilibrium being attained—in fact, the
injurious effect on the eggs of prolonged treatment with such solutions suggests that
no equilibrium is attained until the cells are dead.

AnTAGONIsTIC Errects or Positive AND NeGative TRIVALENT Ions.

If the action of the trivalent positive ions is produced owing to the production of a
positive charge on some constituent of the egg, then the effect of these ions should
be removed by exposing these eggs to a solution containing free hydroxyl ions. The
following experiments show this to be the case.
