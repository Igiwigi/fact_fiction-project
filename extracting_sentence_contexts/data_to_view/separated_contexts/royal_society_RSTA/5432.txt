The discussion focused on the positions and
roles of humans, on the symbiosis of digitalized humans and assets that cohabit a collaborative-

unleashes the human potential, drives new forms of value creation and realizes sustainability. Data accessibility. Additional specific information and results supporting this paper can be found in [2,9,10,29].
