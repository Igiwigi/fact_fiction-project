to the great saving of words and time. Thus the camera impresses on white paper a
negative-reyersed photograph. And this being also the character of an engraving
transferred on similar white paper, it is evident that a single transfer from a camera
picture is equivalent in ultimate effect to a double transfer from an original drawing
or from an engraving on such paper.

9. The chief difficulty in the reproduction of drawings or engravings, consists in
the necessity of operating a double transfer, s0 as to produce a resulting impression
of the same character as the original in both these respects, whereas from what is
above aid it appears that this does not apply in the case of a camera picture. Grant-
ing therefore that such a picture could be impressed with such depth and sharpness
as to be equal in these respects to a finished engraving, the problem of photographic
publication is s80lved, since it is a fact that the negative reversed photographic im-
pression of an engraving, however highly finished, such as is obtained by a single
transfer on white paper, is quite equal in precision and finish to the original en-
graving.

10. The above remarks relate only to what may be called the practical part of the
photographic art. We come now to points of scientific interest. It is noticed then
in the paper above alluded to in abstract, 4thly, That the intensity of chemical ac-
tion of different rays in the solar spectrum appears to be in great measure discon-
nected with their colorific impressions on the eye; and this conclusion, generally
though unequivocally indicated by a variety of experiments in which coloured glasses
were nsed to analyse and separate the incident rays, will be found confirmed, with
many details equally novel and unexpected, in the experiments about to be related,
