If then we substibute in 7 (7, m, 1) for | and m the values B+n and «—n, we 8ee that
1 may range in numerical value between 0 and the least of the integers \—PÞ, p— &, v,
and may be positive or negative. The operator T, in fact, becomes

We have therefore now to consider a series in which any term is the product of (1)
an invariable power of 2, (2) an invariable operator, (3) a variable coefficient whose
parameter is n. If we denote the first two of these factors by the symbol #, then the
sum of all snch terms is aK,
