Figure 1. This graph is drawn considering all possible ways of applying the rewriting rules to f. The vertices correspond to
polynomials obtained from f and the application of the rewriting rules. The edges are oriented and labelled by the number of
the rewriting rule that was applied. That is, each edge corresponds to a rewriting step. The dashed path is a duplication, and
later on we will explain why we duplicated a path.

Now, considering this graph, we see nine different paths from f to zero. Nevertheless, we
realize quite easily that some paths are essentially the same.

In fact, whenever we have a polynomial to which we can apply the rewriting rules in different
ways if there is no overlapping in monomials to which we apply the rules, the paths are going

to be essentially the same. An example of such ‘no overlapping’ is: f = —xy* + xy° 2, yp +x 2
yP —y* and f= —2y! +2?  -ryt —y Sy — yt,

So, whenever there is no overlapping in the application of the rewriting rules, let us colour
the ‘area’ between those applications of the rewriting rule. An ‘area’ betweeen rewriting rules is
called a cell.

An example where there is overlapping (in y) is: f = —x(y4) + xy 4 xy? and f = —(xy)y? +

xy? 4 y° +xy°. In this case, we do not colour the area between the application of these rewriting
