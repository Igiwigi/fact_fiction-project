with any certainty. I have now become the less concerned to prepare such products
because, while the process by which they are cbtained—hydrolysis at high temperature
—is not one likely to throw much light upon the constitution of the pigment from a
synthetical point of view, repeated efforts have convinced me that the yield must
always be so small, that for analytical work it is nearly, if not quite, as convenient to
work with the natural substance.

V. Analysis of the Natural Yellow Pigment.

Having regard to the fact that the substance is an amorphous one, its purity being
therefore difficult to demonstrate, the following analyses are given with all due reserve.
But it will be seen that substantial agreement is obtained in the figures yielded by
pigment from entirely different species, and even from different genera, a fact which
should certainly add to their value. A sufficient number of a given species of insect
to yield pigment for quantitative work is seldom to be obtained on any one occasion.
The analyses were therefore made at long intervals during a period of more than three
years, the combustion apparatus used varying in different experiments. All the
results obtained are given below, no kind of selection of more concordant figures
having been made.

Tn all cases, the wings, after removal from the bodies of the inseets, were allowed
to stand for two or three days in rectified spirit. This was then replaced by cold
water, and the wings again allowed to stand for a day or two. Considerable quantities
of soluble constituents are thus removed. The pigment was then extracted by heating
with distilled water. The hot yellow aqueous extract was filtered and cooled, when
