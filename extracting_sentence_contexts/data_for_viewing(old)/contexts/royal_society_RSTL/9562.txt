spider-like bodies known as Derrer's cells are met with. They are distributed espe-
cially along the course of the blood-vessels which vertically traverse this superficial
layer of the cortex. Closely packed beneath the pia mater, their long filaments
spread in all directions embracing the nearest blood-vessel. They thin out in numbers
below the upper third of this layer, becoming few, and scattered widely apart in the
neighbourhood of the small pyramidal layer. It may here be stated that these peculiar
bodies are found in very scant numbers throughout the various 8ubjacent layers, but
towards the lower realms of the spindle layer they again congregate in larger numbers,
become especially abundant along the blood-vessels which course through the medullary
strands at the confines of the cortex. It is evident from this distribution that they
are more especially limited to the regions of the greater vascular channels, and do not
intrude upon the regions of capillary distribubion. This fact I regard as significant,
when we also take into consideration their reappearance in Man as morbid elements
in those diseases of the brain which are regarded as closely connected by a causal
relationship with extensive vascular legions. > The pia mater is nob only thickened, but
is strongly attached to the cortex by means of these bodies, and over certain regions,
as the two lower parietal convolutions, the adhesion is 80 strong that the pia cannot
be separated without destroying the subjacent layer. In these regions of firm
adhesions betwixt the pia mater and cortex the processes of these cells are extremely
coarse, and often form a dense felt of fibres immediately beneath the pia. Such a
condition I have not observed in Man except as the result of retrogressive changes in
diseased regions. The depth of this characteristic formation is usually 134 mm.,
and yaries from 4rd to 4th the depth of the first layer. The other elements of this
layer resemble in all esxential features those of the corresponding formation in the Pig.
