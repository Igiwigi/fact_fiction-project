feedback loop that rewards the infant for kicking, culminating
in a robust and long-lived association between the visual
stimulus (the mobile) and the kick response. This experimen-
tal procedure likely recruits a network with very different
characteristics than the ones involved in SL where infants
learn associations between stimuli (not between a stimulus
and response) without overt reinforcement. Brain imaging
in adults shows that category learning with and without
reinforcement recruits distinct corticostriatal loops [20,21].
Nor do other memory tasks used with infants apply to SL.
Although deferred imitation requires infants to retain
sequences of events, such learning is thought to rely on explicit
as opposed to implicit memory [22]. The fact that infants do not
reliably learn transitions between arbitrarily related events in
deferred imitation until 22 months of age [22], long after they
show evidence of SL, adds further concern that deferred imita-
tion recruits a different memory system than SL. To address the
question of retention of SL in infants, I turn to work on reten-
tion of the kind of information that is likely to involve SL
in natural language and the handful of studies of long-term
retention of SL.

Evidence suggests that perceptual prerequisites of SL begin
prenatally. Foetuses can detect low-frequency components
of maternal speech, primarily changes in pitch that cue major
