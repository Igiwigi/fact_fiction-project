for this purpose multiply the equation by NG, then reducing by means of a previous
formula, the equation becomes

(VqGN'+ 09GN') VQGN'—w(VaGN'+DQGN') VoGN'=0,



MR. A. GAYLEY'S MEMOIR UPON CAUSTICS. 275
which is equivalent to
VqGN(, *DQGN +(p*—1) VQGN )— oaJGN' VaGN'=0,
and the factors are
V9GNV poOQGN'+(#—1) VQGNIE ogGN. yQGN=0;
it is in fact easy to see that these equations represent lines passing through the point G
and inclined to GN at angles +g', where o' is given by the equations

Sand there is no difficulty in distinguishing in any particular case between the refracted
gray and the false refracted ray.
