It interacts physically with RNF168 lating end-resection [74,75] (figure 2). However, how SMARCA5
in the DSB-flanking chromatin compartment in a PARP1- chromatin remodelling activity promotes end-resection remains
dependent manner. In fact, PARP1 PARylates RNF168 and to be established. The role of SMARCAS in NHEJ, on the other
PARylated RNF168 is bound by SMARCAS5. RNF168-bound hand, has been studied in more detail and was shown to
SMARCAS is then thought to locally remodel chromatin, depend on ACF1 [73].
