pressure of 1 bar.!8 The cooling rate was less than or equal to 100°C h~! because higher cooling
rates would have produced some zoning [14, fig. 22] and no zoning was measured in Iris. The final
Fe-content of the olivine resulted from the available FeO in the melt. The moderately volatile
element Mn was incorporated during crystallization and the MnO-content of the olivine also
traced the bulk composition of the melt precursor materials. Iris has an olivine composition of
Fa35-Fa40, with MnO = 0.63 wt%, Cr2O3 = 0.16 wt% and CaO = 0.3 wt%.

The olivine Fe-content categories Iris as a type II chondrule or type II chondrule fragment.
The oxygen fugacity being close to IW can be explained by Iris forming in a high dust/gas
environment where evaporated pre-existing silicate dust contributes oxygen to the gas phase. The
MELTS results show that the bulk sodium content of Iris started with Na2O = 3.5 wt% and 40% of
the Na was lost during cooling from the melt in an open system behaviour for Na. Na is volatile
and the fact that only 40% of the Na was lost means that the ambient partial pressure of Na was
near equilibrium, which is commensurate with a dust enrichment of approximately 104 [14,202].

A second Stardust chondrule ‘Callie’ consists mainly of olivine (Fa36-Fa41) and Callie also
contains Na-rich feldspar (plagioclase) [14]. A third Stardust chondrule ‘Torajiro’ [203] consists
mainly of olivine (Fal9-Fa20), low-Ca pyroxene (En86Wo3), small kamacite blebs (Fe, Ni-
metal found in meteorites), and glass enriched in SiO2 and AljO3 [14]. Compared with Iris,
Torajiro formed at slightly higher temperatures and higher oxygen fugacity (1090°C, based on
the olivine/spinel geothermometer, and log(log(fo,)) = —12(IW + 1.4) [14]. Torajiro’s olivine is
Xa = 10 mol%, which is lower than Iris at Xpq = 36 mol%, even though Torajiro crystallized from
a melt at higher oxygen fugacity. If we consider Iris and Torajiro as examples of type II chondrule
formation, the oxygen fugacity of crystallization does not translate directly to Fe-content of the
olivine but instead to the olivine-spinel system. This is in contrast to condensation sequences of
