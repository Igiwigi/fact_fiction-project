Because : =
this potential W is bounded from below by w(1) = 1/y â€” 1/a, the energy E[j] always makes sense, : 5

The minimizers of the energy E[j/] are related to stationary states for the aggregation equation DR
pt=V -(pVW x p) studied in [1-5] with repulsive-attractive potentials [6-12]. The set of local : 3
minimizers of the interaction energy, in both the discrete setting of empirical measures (equal- N
mass Dirac deltas) and the continuum setting of general probability measures, can exhibit rich :8
complicated structure as studied numerically in [12,13]. In fact, it is shown in [12] that the : 8
dimensionality of the support of local minimizers of (1.1) depends on the strength of the repulsion 5

at zero of the potential W. For instance, as the repulsion at the origin becomes stronger (i.e. a gets
smaller) in three dimensions, the support of the local minimizer is concentrated on points, curves,
surfaces and eventually some sets of non-zero Lebesgue measure. From the viewpoint of applications, these models with non-local interactions are ubiquitous
in the literature.
