spicuous also on account of its smaller size. A layer of sclerotomic cells now forms
a continuous investment round it, completely masking the earlier mesenchymatous
layer. The nuclei of these cells are oval or slightly flattened, and quite different
from the nuclei of mesenchymatous cells. The tube of cells thus formed round the
notochord may be termed the perichordal tube (Plate 12, fig. 8, p.t.). The segmental
waves of the notochord are still evident posterior to the occipital region, but do not
occur within this region.

The occipital, cervical and thoracic regions are quite well defined and the vertebral
structures, although still entirely membranous, are in a fairly advanced stage of
differentiation. Dorsal nerve roots have been developed and the vertebral arteries,
together with the basilar artery, are complete. Intersegmentally, the vertebral artery
is large, but within the segments its diameter is smaller, which fact lends support to
the view that it is formed by anastomosis of the intersegmental arteries. The inter-
segmental arteries between the 6th and 7th cervical segments form a connection
between the vertebral artery and the aorta. From this point, the vertebral artery
runs forward lateral to the notochord, curving over the anterior part of the atlas
rudiment to course between the floor of the hind-brain and the occipital vertebral
rudiments as the A. basalis.

The intersegmental fissure has become almost entirely obliterated, but the boundaries
of the primitive segments are still indicated by the intersegmental blood vessels (Plate 12,
fig. 8, 7.s.b.v.). A complete obliteration of the intrasclerotomic fissure has also been
effected, but the perichordal disc, which was formed from the ventral portions of both
cranial and caudal sclerotomites, still marks the middle of the segment. Frontal
