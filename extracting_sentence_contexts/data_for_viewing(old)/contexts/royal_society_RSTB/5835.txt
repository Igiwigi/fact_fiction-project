setules. The distal part is slightly bent forwards, but it is doubtful whether it is capable
of being moved. In Moina all that remains of the maxilla is a slight hillock covered
with setules in the typical position between the maxillule and first trunk limb, while
in Daphnia all trace of the maxilla has disappeared.

General.

In the foregoing account we have demonstrated that while the Branchiopodan
maxillule is remarkably constant throughout the group, the maxilla exhibits two district
typesâ€”that of the Notostraca and Conchostraca, in which it resembles the maxillule,
and that of Lipostraca, Anostraca and Cladocera, where it is totally different and is
always characterised by the presence of a small number of soft, flexible, plumose sete,
The most unexpected fact emerging from this division is the grouping of the Cladocera
with the Anostraca rather than with the Conchostraca. It is generally accepted that
the Cladocera evolved from an ancestor similar to the modern Conchostraca (Sars, 1896,
p. 37), and it would be expected at first sight that the two groups would exhibit

the same type of maxilla. However, we were fortunate in obtaining some larval
Conchostraca from Dr. G. 8. Carter which he had collected in South America, probably
Eulimnadia chacoensis, and a study of these unexpectedly explained the anomalous
grouping.
