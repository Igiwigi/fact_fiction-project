electrochemical equivalent, while the other, which contained 150 cub. centims., gave
1:11923. With an abnormal electrolyte a large bowl will therefore give a heavier
deposit than a small one, but although there is an appreciable difference in the size of
the Rayleigh bowl and the Richards crucible which Professor van Disk used, we do
not think that the differences which he observed are to be entirely attributed to this
cause.

Professor Watson also sent a silver nitrate solution used by him in 1895. This
gave 1'11872 (23a) for the electrochemical equivalent, and when diluted to a 74 per
cent. solution it gave 111850 (60a) with a current of 2°3 amperes, and 1°11837 (61a)
on a second electrolysis with a current of 0°1 ampere.

In view of these facts and the great difference in the size of the voltameters, &c.,
used by other observers, it appears that no very useful purpose would be served by
an attempt to explain the results of other experimenters without first reproducing as
nearly as possible the conditions under which they worked. This we shall endeavour
to do.

It is of some interest, however, to compare the results obtained by absolute
methods, since a form of voltameter practically identical with that used by Lord
