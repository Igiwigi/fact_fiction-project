information contained in the molecules, but can actually decrease it. It is hardly conceivable that
continuing Spiegelman’s experiment eventually produces a system as complex as the simplest life
we know. Therefore, the capability of undergoing evolution in and of itself falls short of explaining
the origin of life as we know it.

The limitation of regarding evolution as the end of the origin of life is reinforced by the work
of Lincoln & Joyce [11]. Lincoln and Joyce have artificially synthesized ‘a self-sustained chemical
system capable of undergoing Darwinian evolution’. Their system is considerably simpler than
that of Spiegelman, in that it does not contain any externally supplied enzymes. However, in
their system, only 12 bp are subject to evolution, so that the total number of possible genotypes
is bounded above by 4!? ~ 10”. In fact, the maximum amount of information that can accumulate
(ie. 24 bits) is smaller than that required to get evolution started (namely, 84 bits) [12]. Whether
or not their system should be called life is only a matter of definition.

3. Evolution as the ‘means’ of the origin of life

The above discussion ends in an alternative conception of life: life is bacteria, archaea, plants,
animals and so forth, all of which possess genes, enzymes, membranes and so forth (i.e. the
extensional definition of life). According to this definition, the origin of life is not the same as the
origin of evolution, but includes the emergence of life through evolution. In this sense, evolution
is a ‘means’ of the origin of life.
