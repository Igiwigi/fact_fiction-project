T. WHITTAKER ON THE CONNEXION OF
ยง 4. The Automorphie Functions of the Group.

from the fact which has just been proved, that the genus of all groups of the
kind we have found is zero, we know that the algebraic relation between any two
automorphic functions of the group is of genus zero; therefore all the automorphic
Junctions of the group can be expressed as rational functions of a certain one of them. We shall denote this one by z. First, let us see what degree of arbitrariness there is in the choice of the function z.
