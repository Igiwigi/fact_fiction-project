The kinetic differential equations according to mechan-
isms (2.la-e) are formulated in continuous variables
[A(t)] = a(t) and [X;(t)] = xi(t), i=1, ...,n

Althusian fitness value of X; and kj is the rate parameter for
replication of X; catalysed by X;. We shall refer to the f; values
as fitness parameters and to the kj values as cooperation par-
ameters despite the fact that certain combinations of k;; values
may lead to strong selection, for example the multidimensional
Schlogl model [30,31]. The reaction equation (2.1c) takes into account catalysis
for all n? binary combinations of replicators in the system. The occurrence of efficient catalysis, however, is a rare
event and accordingly the number of catalytic interactions
in mechanism (2.1a—e) is unrealistically large.
