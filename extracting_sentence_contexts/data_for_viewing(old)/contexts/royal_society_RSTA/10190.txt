white and ‘775 colour. This shows that the white in the colours is by no means a
negligible quantity.

(17.) Significance of the Inherent White.

In regarding the table, Column V., for white, it will be remarked that the maximum
amount of white is near SSN (42). In ‘Colour Photometry,’ Part ILT. (‘ Phil. Trans.,’
1892), it was shown that in this region the light disappeared last when the intensity
was reduced. It was also shown that the maximum luminosity of a very feeble
colourless spectrum was near this point, and in the concluding page of my last paper
on the colour sensations, I pointed out that the presence of the fundamental sensation
of light, which is white, must be taken into account in any theory of colour vision.
The fact that in these slightly revised measures we get more than indications that
white exists in the region where the fundamental sensation has been shown also to
exist, leads one to believe that we are in some way separating this sensation from the
three-colour sensations. What seems to confirm this view is that when a very bright
spectrum, such as is given by sunlight, is measured, there is a tendency for the
proportion of white in the region SSN’s 48 to 16 to diminish. This is what we should
expect to find, since fixed amplitude of wave colour vanishes at some, as also does the
fundamental light at a lesser amplitude, be the spectrum feeble or brilliant.

(18.) The Normal Spectrum Curves.

Table V. gives the sensation curves for the normal spectrum, and is shown in the
same manner as it was in my previously quoted paper.
