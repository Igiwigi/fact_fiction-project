is a long-term programme with many ramifications, somewhat reminiscent of
Hilbert’s sixth problem: the axiomatization of all branches of science, in which
mathematics plays an important part.

In the following sections we will put flesh on the bare bones of the above
remarks by listing a few of the spectacular discoveries in mathematics that have
emerged from the interaction with physics.

3. Counting curves

Our first example comes from enumerative geometry, a particularly active field
in the nineteenth century. In classical geometry many problems concern counting
the number of solutions. Starting with the fact that two straight lines in the plane
meet in one point (which may be at infinity, in which case the lines are parallel),
one goes on to show that curves in the plane given by polynomial equations of
degrees m and n meet in mn points, provided we allow complex solutions, points
at infinity and count intersections with multiplicity.

A slightly more complicated problem is to count the number of curves in the
plane that satisfy certain constraints. One such problem for curves of degree d,
which are rational, i.e. can be described parametrically by rational functions of
one complex variable, is to ask how many such curves go through n general points.
If n=3d-—1, this number Nj is finite and the problem is to find a formula for
Ny. If d=1 or 2, then N = 1, but the general formula was not known to classical
geometers, and only emerged from physics! Moreover, the methods from physics
