(g) Network memory promotes cultural complexity
and ratcheting

Human cumulative culture is characterized by a ratchet
effect, whereby cultural traits survive across generations
with relatively little backward slippage and continuous incor-
poration of innovations [7]. Although non-human primates
have provided many examples of long-lasting cultural
traditions, the more complex cultural traits of hunter-
gatherers suggest higher rates of cultural accumulation. The
fact that culture is produced by populations rather than indi-
viduals may explain why ratcheting is more efficient in
humans. For example, a BaYaka population from Congo
demonstrated collective knowledge of 32 medicinal plants,
but no individual knew the whole medicinal repertoire [10].
Therefore, the ratchet effect implies reliance on a collective
memory that distributes cultural knowledge across individ-
uals unable to fully recreate it from scratch. We argue that
a main reason hunter-gatherers build more efficient collective
memories is their unique social structure. Simulations have
shown that large population size and full network intercon-
nectivity reduce the risk of cultural loss, but also wipe out
diversity by homogenizing traits owing to group-wide trans-
