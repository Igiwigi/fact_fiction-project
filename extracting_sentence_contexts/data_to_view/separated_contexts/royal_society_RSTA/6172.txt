The
‘crowdsourced review system’ was based on a bulletin board set up by EPCC at the University
of Edinburgh (the RAMP Forums). This allowed all RAMP volunteers, among others, to post
unsolicited reviews of preprints. Unlike conventional reviewing, this process was transparent and
turned out to be generally more constructive than is often the case in traditional publishing; this
could be due to the fact that reviewers themselves chose papers they were interested in reviewing. Most of these reviews were by experienced reviewers from outside the epidemiological
community, who were able to assess the scientific methodology and statistical significance of
the claims made. By this stage, everyone was also well acquainted with what was important
for policy.
