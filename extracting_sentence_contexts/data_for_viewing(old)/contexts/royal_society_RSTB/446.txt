bilateral movement,

Movements of Muscles of the same side as that stimulated.

The phenomenon of bilateral movement occurring upon excitation of one hemisphere
has often been approached from its theoretical, experimental, and clinical aspects.
Tt has been assumed by Broappent* that this is effected by the impulses passing
from the sound hemisphere across commissural fibres postulated to exist between the
lower (i.e., bulbo-spinal) centres of the two sides, and he explained the common mode
of recovery from hemorrhagic compression and destruction of the internal capsule by
this theory. This theory has been favourably received by neurologists as an expla-
nation of the phenomenon of bilateral movement, but we submit that the subject can
only profitably be treated upon experimental facts as a basis.

Before any satisfactory conclusions can be arrived at, we must obviously first deter-
mine exactly how much bilateral representation of movement exists in the cortex of
anormal uninjured nervous system, and, in this case, of the Bonnet Monkey. Further
we must understand clearly what we mean by bilateral representation.

Beginning with this last, we mean that the same movement of symmetrical parts
of both sides of the body is represented in one point of the cortex of both hemi-
spheres, 7.¢., that excitation of such a point evokes simultaneous and identical move-
ment in the same part of both sides of the body.
