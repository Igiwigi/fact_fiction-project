Botwm, in figs. 139, 140, and for Tmesipteris, in fig. 145, where the synangium
“ely invested by the protecting lobes. Moreover, it is to be remarked that in
gases as these, where the synangia appear as very considerable and bulky
Sgn the adaxial face of the leaf, the foliage leaf itself being also flattened in a
uf,plane, the presence of an extended leaf-apex would be highly inconvenient in
ing of the parts in the bud, for the result would be a lax bud, in which the
parts would be greatly exposed. By the arrest of the apex of the leaf,
titution of the lateral lobes, as implied in the hypothesis above put forward,
@ compact bud is produced, and the synangia are better protected. The arrest
pex of the leaf may, perhaps, be compared with a similar arrest in the flower
in Angiosperms, where mechanical inconvenience has led to abortion of
or carpels.
Bthe ground of the above facts and considerations, I conclude that the
the Psilotacee (apart from branching in the ordinary sense of the word,
is much more common in Psilotum than in 7° mesipteris) is a simple shoot,
of an axis, bearing sporangiophores and foliage leaves. These alternate
another in irregular zones, and in 7’ mesipteris the transition from foliage
to sporangiophores may be frequently repeated, in Psilotwm the repetition is
i The condition is thus similar to that in Lycopodium Selago with
ive sterile and fertile zones. The abortive synangia correspond to the
sporangia in this and other species of Lycopodium, and accordingly the
al considerations as regards origin from a simple strobilus, which were laid
Lp. 535, for the genus Lycopodium, will apply with equal force to Psilotum
