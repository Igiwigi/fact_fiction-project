In another place experiments have been described which proved the existence of
a vortex motion in the air round an obstacle in a vibrating gas, providing that the
amplitude of the vibration exceeds certain limits governed by the principle of dynamical
similarity. Under the conditions ordinarily prevailing in a sounding tube, and in
particular the conditions of THomas’s and Coox’s experiments, this vortex motion
takes place. Neglect of this fact is the cause of the obscurity and contradiction which
has been connected with the subject. The conditions of vortex-free motion postulated
in Kornta’s theory do not hold when ridges are formed ; they can be made to prevail
by reducing the intensity of the sound, but precisely when these conditions hold the
ridges, which _Kornie’s theory is constructed to explain, do not form at all. In the following pages it is shown how vortex motion, combined with the general
circulation between antinode and node described in the paper just cited,t can be made
to account for the dust figures hitherto observed, and new features of the behaviour
of dust particles in a vibrating gas are described and explained.
