must assert, that though nitrogene has a weaker affinity for oxygene than hydrogene,
yet a compound of hydrogene and nitrogene is capable of decomposing water.

The first assumption is however by far the most contradictory to the order of com-
mon chemical facts ; the last, though it cannot be wholly removed, is yet lessened by
analogies. Thus alloys in general, and inflammable compounds, are more oxidable
than the simple substances that compose them, Sulphuret of iron at common tem-
peratures decomposes water with facility, whereas suIphur under the same circum-
stances, has no action on water, and.iron a very small one, "The compound of phos-
phorus and hydrogene, is more inflammable than either of its constituents.

Should a new theory of the dependence of the chemical forms of matter upon elec-
trical powers be established, the facts belonging to ammouium would admit of a more
easy Solution. Ammonium might be supposed to be a simple body, which by com=
bining with different quantities of water, and in different states of electricity, formed
nitrogene, ammonia, atmospherical air, nitrous oxide, nitrous gas, and nitric acid.

Water, on this idea, must be supposed a constituent part of all the different gasses;
but its electricities in oxygene and hydrogene would probably be the very reverse of what
they have been supposed by M. RitTes, and some ingenious English enquirers.
