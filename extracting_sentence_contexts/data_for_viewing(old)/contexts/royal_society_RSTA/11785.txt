&the other hand, lithium, with a point of fusion below that of bismuth, and zine with
Ba fusing point below that of antimony, have not exerted a similar effect in lowering
§ the temperature of annealing.* The melting point of the impurities, although it is not
without influence, is not the sole factor to be considered. It should be observed that
6 lead, judging from what is known of its action on gold, probably behaves like bismuth
and thallium. Amalgamation also appears to be a phenomenon of the same kind,
possibly occurring, owing to the liquidity of mercury, at a still lower temperature.
But gold, mercury, thallium, lead, and bismuth follow each other in the classification
of elements based on increasing atomic weight, and are grouped on the same horizontal
line of Menpeteer’s table. This coincidence is curious. Whatever it may signify,
this transformation of the structure of a metal, at a temperature so far below its
melting point, in the presence of only two-tenths per cent. of a foreign body, is
probably not an isolated fact, and appears to open a new field for research.

* We are not speaking of potassium, which appears to be concentrated in a cement,
