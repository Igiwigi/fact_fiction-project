Studying the other modes of the lattice in this regime, we conclude that the lower dispersion
surfaces below the band gap, such as those in the first column of table 1, are dominated by
translational motion. Similarly, the eigenfrequencies in 2 corresponding to flexural and torsional
rotations all occur in the upper pass band, so we conclude that rotational motion dominates above
the finite band gap.

Considering jz > 1/24, such as in the second and third column of table 1, it is no longer a simple
matter to determine which type of motion—translational, flexural rotation or torsional rotation—
dominates a given dispersion surface. Taking as an example the dispersion diagram with pp = 0.1
and c=1 from table 1, whose eigenmodes are illustrated in figure 2, all surfaces have a mixture
of translational and rotational eigenmodes at the high-symmetry points, so we can only conclude
that there is no dominant mode for each surface in this case. Furthermore, given the sensitivity
of the dispersion diagrams to the rotational inertia and torsional stiffness, the fact that the system
is fully coupled, and the size of the parameter space for jz and c, it is not possible to provide a
generalization that associates a particular dispersion surface with a dominant type (translational,
flexural rotation, torsion) of motion.

Even when the boundaries of the pass bands are invariant, such as all of the lower dispersion
surfaces from the first column of table 1, the shape of the surface and its slowness contours still
depend on the values of and c. Therefore, the parameters and c allow for a great deal of
control over the direction of propagating waves in the system. The slowness contours are typically
very sensitive to changes in the two parameters, so it is common to find slowness contours with
completely different shapes for the same value of w. We will make use of this capability in §4 to
demonstrate a number of interesting features, including negative refraction.
