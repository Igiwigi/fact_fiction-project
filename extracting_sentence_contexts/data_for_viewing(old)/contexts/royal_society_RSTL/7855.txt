in U=0 we write X?2=4YZ, it becomes Z(XW-+5Y?)=0; and then in 5U=0, writing
5Y?= — XW, we have

5WXZ+Z(—XW)+5X*Y=X(5XY+47W)=0.

168. I say that the spinode curve is made up of the edge X=0, Z=0 once, and of
the cubic curye; and therefore s'=1.


310 PROFESSOR CAYLEY ON CUBIC SURFACES.

In fact in the reciprocal surface the cuspidal curve is made up of the skew cubic, and
of a line the reciprocal of the axis, being a cusp-nodal line, and 80 counting once as part
of the cuspidal curve: the pencil of planes through the line is thus part of the cuspidal
torse; and reverting to the original cubic surface, we have the axis as part of the spinode
curve: I assuwme that it counts once.

The edge is a single tangent of the spinode curye; B'=1.

169. The equation is obtained by means of the binary cubic
4w7(Xx+7Z2)+X(YZ—wX)?,
or, as this may be written,
(8%, —2pw, 4*+4aw, 122w7X, ZY.
