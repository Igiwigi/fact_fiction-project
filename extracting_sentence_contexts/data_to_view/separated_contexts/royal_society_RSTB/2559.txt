The irregular pores
in the septa are thus explained in both Lophoserinz and Eupsamminz. The nodulate shape of the individual trabecular growth-parts in the Eupsamminz
closely resembles that characteristic of Pseudoastrwine, of Siderastrwa, and of
Lophoserine. In all these types, as well as in Fungia, the coalescence of septal ends
with one another is frequent, and is associated with the general fact that the basal
body-wall in this group forms small invaginations at any part of the interradial
loculi,

As a rule, the branching colonies of Eupsammids tend to the simpler form
of canalicular system observed in Funginse and Lophoserinw, and have not the
complicated coenenchyme of Turbinaria, Madrepora, and Porites. Reeapitulating briefly the most important features of Hupsammia, we have -—

(1.) The trabeculee composing the septum often incompletely united with one
another, as in Pseudoastraine, Fungia, Lophoseris, &c,

(2.) The individual growth-parts of any one trabecula not always attached end to
end, although following each other in vertical succession. Where such an aperture
is left in the trabecula, and it happens to be alongside of an aperture left between
