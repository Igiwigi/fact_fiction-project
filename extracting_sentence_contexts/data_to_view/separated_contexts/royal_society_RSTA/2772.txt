Multi-stable behaviour allows for the possibility that plate tectonics could emerge, transition
to another mode and re-emerge along a planet's cooling path [112]. The question of ‘when’ would
then need to be clarified. One could ask ‘When was the most recent emergence?’ but the fact
would remain that interpretation of the geological record, which could contain signals of prior
emergence, would need to be treated differently. Evidence for single plate behaviour over the
Earth’s midlife [5] would, under that possibility, not be inconsistent with subduction and/or plate
tectonic signatures earlier in the geological record. Finite amplitude instabilities can fail.
