A simple example of FT is the transformation of the spherical fields emanating from a point
source into a planar phase front by using a flat lens whose behaviour mimics that of a convex :
lens, for instance. The same problem when tackled by the TO leads to a relatively complex design =
and calls for MTMs that are not only difficult to realize, but lead to performance characteristics 3
that are not on par with the FT-based design, as we will demonstrate in this paper. This is true :
despite the fact that the latter design uses realistic materials, which can either be fabricated in nee)
the laboratory, or are commercially available off-the-shelf that are modified slightly to realize the :
desired material parameters. Such materials are wideband as well as relatively insensitive to the [4
polarization and incident angle of the incoming wave. DN

Finally, we will point to a new interpretation of the TO algorithm that has recently been [5
employed to design absorbers that help reduce the RCS of real-world targets.
