The
amount of flow was found by measuring the amount remaining in the
upper vessel,

If, however, the vessels of the stem contain much air, and a con-
siderable head of water is used, a distinct difference is shown. . Thus,
with a portion of an actively transpiring 5-year-old stem of a pear, the
amount of flow was 38°5 cub. centims. per hour under a head of
4 metres, but only 21°2 cub. centims under the suction of the same
column. The explanation is undoubtedly due to the fact that under
pressure the air in the vessels is compressed, whereas under the action
of a suspended column the pressure is less than that of the atmosphere,
so that the air-bubbles expand and block the vessels more completely,
besides tending to increase in size instead of diminishing, as when
under pressure. This last effect can be avoided by using water contain-
ing no dissolved air. The oxygen contained in the water absorbed
from the soil is converted into carbon dioxide, a more soluble gas, in
its upward passage, but when the dissolved nitrogen reaches those
parts where water is being drawn up by suction it will tend
to appear as gas, and accumulate together with the superfluous
oxygen.
