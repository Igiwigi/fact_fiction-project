describing the hemodynamics of blood flow near the bifurcation site of the left coronary artery.
The appearance of atherosclerotic plaques leads to a weak blood flow along the LAD branch
(sector II, figure 5) and more intense blood flow along the DA branch (sector III, figure 5), where
an atherosclerotic plaque takes place as well. At the same time, low-intensity circulation flows
are formed in the LAD branch, which is an effect of blood flow around the contour of the carina.
After the installation of stents in both arterial branches, the carinaâ€™s contour and the flow pattern
are changed. A stronger blood flow occurs in the LAD branch and the difference with the blood
flow in the DA is significantly reduced. The circulation area in the LAD beyond the bifurcation
zone becomes more extensive and stable.

Another interesting hemodynamic feature is the occurrence of retrograde (opposite directed)
blood flow. For example, before stenting (panel 2, figure 10), a retrograde flow occurs in the LAD
branch (sector II) due to the fact that the pressure in the section Outl exceeds the pressure at the
entrance to this branch near the bifurcation site. This is obviously because of the blood flow to
the neighbouring DA branch near the flow bifurcation point. After stenting (panel 2, figure 11),
retrograde flow occurs in both branches due to the alignment of velocity flows at the bifurcation
site (panel 2 in figures 10 and 11).

A significant physical aspect of stenting is undoubtedly a reduction in shear stresses in the
bifurcation region of the artery and, in particular, in the LAD branch (see the magnitudes of shear
stresses in figures 12 and 13). This is obviously due to the alignment of hydrodynamic flows in
both branches and cause of the formation of a new carina contour (see figure 10 versus figure 11).
This reduction in shear stress can lead to atherogenesis and the formation of atherosclerotic
plaques after the bifurcation.
