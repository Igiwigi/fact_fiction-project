Consider a transformation

where the variables are always supposed to be chosen such as to make the series in
(1) convergent. We want to restrict the x, toa given set IN of the complex plane and
investigate the possible sets § (y,). If, for instance,

|x) 1 (A =], 2, ...),
then

and it is easily seen that for wide classes of matrices (a,,), in fact for every matrix

satisfying i Beeeiont. im 4,, ='0 (4 = 0, 1, ...);

there will be equality in (2) if the x, are suitably chosen. This suggests that the

number

k—>m dA=l

will play an important part here.
