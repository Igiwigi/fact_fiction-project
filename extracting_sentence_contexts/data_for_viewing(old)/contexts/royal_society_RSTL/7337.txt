A point of considerable theoretic importance was inyolved in these experiments. In
his excellent researches on fluorescence, Professor STokEs had invariably found the
refrangibility of the incident light to be Zowered. This rule was 80 constant as almost
to enforce the conviction that it was a law of nature. But if the rays which in the fore-
going experiments raised platinum and gold and silver to a red heat were wholly
extra-red, the rendering visible of the metallic films would be an instance of raised
refrangibility.

And here I thought it desirable to make sure that no trace of the visible radiation
passed through the solution, and als that the invisible radiation was exclusively extra-red.

This latter condition might seem to be unnecessary, because the calorific action of the
extra-violet rays is 80 exceedingly feeble (in fact 80 immeasurably small) that, even
supposing them to reach the platinum, their heating-power would be an utterly vanishing
quantity. Still mechanical considerations rendered the exclusion of all rays, of a higher
refrangibility than those generated at the focus, necessary to the rigid solution of the
problem. Hence, though the iodine employed in the foregoing experiments was suffi-
cient to cut off the light of the sun at noon, I wished to submit its opacity to a severer
test. The following experiments were accordingly executed.

A piece of thick black paper, mounted on a retort-ring, was caused gradually to
approach the focus of obscure rays. The position of the focus was announced by
the piercing of the paper; the combustion being quenched, the retort-ring was moved
Slightly nearer to the lamp, 80 that the converged beam passed through the burnt
aperture, the focus falling about 4 an inch beyond. A bit of blackened platinum held
