only representative of the thick alveolar layer, with its complex network of beams, is
a thin membrane, apparently the only slightly altered sarcolemma.* Taking these
and other facts into consideration, there seems little escape from the conclusion that
in R. radiata, either comparatively little progress has yet been made in the evolution
of an electric organ, or, for some reason or other, at a comparatively early stage the
development of the electric organ has been arrested. The question as to whether the
organ in J, radiata is or is not in a vestigial condition was considered in a previous
paper. All the facts that have been recently accumulated seem to me to point to
R. radiata being one of the most primitive members of the Skate group. If this is
established, it will support the view that the electric organ of Skates does not belong
to vestigial structures. In discussing the place of R. radiata in the phylogeny of its
group, various questions require consideration. From what we know of the ancestral
history of Mammals, Birds, and Reptiles, it seems probable that the smaller (dwarfed
and degraded forms excepted) rather than the larger species of any given genus are
most likely to present ancestral characters. In the case of the Skate genus, the pro-
