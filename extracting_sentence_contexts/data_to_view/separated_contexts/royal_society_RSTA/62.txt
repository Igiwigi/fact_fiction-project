Commonly, nobody asks whether the Ode to Joy is a discovery or formulates the
same question for the whole Ninth Symphony, or the Goldberg Variations, the Cello Suites, or the
Jupiter symphony, just to list some examples. Although these musical masterpieces are implicit
in the manifold of possible combinations of the notes on the pentagram, we all believe that their
writing is a creative act and we can say they are art, even if the definition of art is a matter of
disputations. In fact, we are culturally educated to think that they are art but also, instinctively,
in listening to them we perceive ‘something’ we cannot define explicitly and we go in some
sense beyond the notions we have. Implicitly, these masterpieces indicate even the constitutive
nature of art: as it is the matter that defines in a sense the physical space perceived by the human
observer around himself, so the works are those indicating—without avoiding ambiguity in the
definition—the nature of the aesthetic experience. We can agree with Luigi Pareyson that there is
possibility of art in the entire human diligence in the sense of the formativeness of our actions.
