Figure 10. PIMC results for the dispersion relation co(q) of the DSF (black diamonds, taken from reference [97]) and relative
decay measure of the ITCF AF, (q) for t = 6/2 (dotted blue), t = 6/4 (dashed red) and t = f/10 (solid green) for the
unpolarized UEG with NW = 34 at © = 1 for different values of the density parameter r,. All curves have been renormalized to
their respective q —> O limits, given by the plasma frequency co, in the case of »(q).

similar behaviour; the main difference from w(q) arises from the fact that the single-particle limit
is given by a constant instead of a parabolic divergence.

For rs = 4, we find a very similar picture to that of rs =2 for both w(q) and the three datasets
for AF,(q). Upon further decreasing the density to r; = 10, the dispersion starts to exhibit the
incipient roton minimum around intermediate wavenumbers. This effect is qualitatively reflected
in the relative t-decay measure AF,(q) as a minimum around q ~ 2qp, although its overall
behaviour is less complicated than that of (q), as it does not exhibit the local maximum of the
latter around q = qr.

Finally, we show results for the strongly coupled case of r; = 20 in figure 10d. In this case,
both the roton minimum in w(q) and the reduced decay in AF,(q) are more pronounced, as
expected. Interestingly, the physical mechanism of the roton—the spontaneous alignment of pairs
