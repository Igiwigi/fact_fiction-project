"The eritical pressure of a mixture may therefore be defined as the lowest pressure
at which any further increase of pressure or any change in the length of the column of
exploded gases ceases to affect the ratio of the products of combustion. The critical
pressure is lowered as the quantity of oxygen in the mixture increases. These facts account for the agreement of HorsTMANN's first series of experiments

and those made by BuxsEN with his chain of sparks given in Table VII. Although
the path traversed by each flame from the point of ignition is very small in Buxsex's
experiments compared with HorsTMANN's, yet since the pressures employed by both
experimenters were near to or above the critical pressures of the mixtures exploded,
this great difference in the length of column had no effect on the division of the
oxygen.
