The same considerations of stress would lead in the
present case to the conclusion that the two planes would have a common direction of
slip—namely, their line of intersection. Whilst no evidence is forthcoming from the
test as to the direction of slip, it may be pointed out that the direction of the line of
intersection of the two octahedral planes concerned was nearly parallel to the axis of

the specimen, and a longitudinal direction of shear is indicated in photomicrograph
No. 14. :

The two remaining series of slip-bands mentioned in the description of the test agree
fairly closely with the two remaining octahedral planes, but their appearance suggested
that the part played by these planes in the test must have been insignificant. This
view is confirmed by the fact that they did not reappear in the final stage of the test.
