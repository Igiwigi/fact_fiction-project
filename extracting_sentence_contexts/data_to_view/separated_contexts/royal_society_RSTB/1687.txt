That
the elements in question are really the spiral tracheides or protoxylem is proved by
the longitudinal sections (see Plate 23, fig. 13, px., ef: also C.N. 1982). We thus see, that the position of the initial strand is essentially the same as in
the bundles of the stem. We desire to call special attention to the fact that there
is not the slightest reason for regarding the. centrifugal or lower portion of the xylem
‘in the leaf * as secondary, which is the view of MM. Berrranp and Renavtr in the
ase of Porexylon. In Lyginodendron this tissue shows no sign of radial seriation
‘and consists mainly of spiral or reticulate elements, while pitted tracheides chiefly
