row of figures of Plate XXIV. I have copied the only delineations published by others
of ova from the Fallopian tube. The amount of information obtainable from these,
will be seen on comparing with them eleven states of ova from the Fallopian tube,
figured in my © Second Series,” and upwards of thirty more in the present paper.

323. It was stated in my last memoir{\ that the Purkinjean, or germinal vyesicle,
does not disappear at the period previously supposed ; but that after fecundation it
returns from the surface to the centre of the ovum. My later researches have not
only established the fact now mentioned, but they also enable me, I believe from ac-
tual observation, to make known the destiny of this important object. These inves-
tigations realise the almost universal supposition that the germinal yesicle is the es-
sential element of the ovum ; but how far they realise any of the speculations of phy-
siologists as to what becomes of it, will be seen on comparing the facts about to be
recorded, with opinions quoted in the Appendix to this memoir.

The Doctrine of © Cells.”

324. I formerly mentioned || that Scuwanx©, basing his researches in the animal,
upon the discoveries of ScaLEextFÞ in the vegetable kingdom, had demonstrated
that in development the same phenomena are exhibited in both ; that he had shown
animal tissues in general, like those of plants, to be reducible to modifications of vesi-
cles or © cells;” and that the mode of origin of the cells is essentially the same in
animals as ScaLEIDeNn had discovered it to be in plants. ScarLeen had found,
that the membrane of each cell is formed at the surface of the object previously
known as the nucleus of the cell; and in the nucleus he discovered a nucleolus.
