Lemmermann
(1914) remarks briefly that there is a single basal granule united to the nucleus by
a rhizoplast, but gives no authority for this statement. Internal evidence suggests
that he is describing von Prowazek’s figures. Grassé (1926) has suggested that the
bodies described by von Prowazek were in fact the parabasal apparatus, and
accordingly he includes the Bicoecinae along with the Herpetomonadinae, Bodoninae,
Polymastiginae, Hypermastiginae and Distomatinae in the Protomastigina Senn. All
these families are characterized by the presence of a parabasal, almost invariably in
association with the blepharoplast (or basal granule). Examination of preparations of form 4 shows that there is no parabasal present of
the form described by von Prowazek under the name chromidia.
