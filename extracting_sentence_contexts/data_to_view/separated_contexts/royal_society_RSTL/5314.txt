Experiments published by DuTRro-
CHET give a capillary ascension to pure water of 12 millimeters, and to a solution of
common salt, of density 1-12, 6:14 millimeters, or only one-half of the former ascen-
sion. If a porous septum, occupied by such a saline solution, had the same s0lution
in contact with one surface and pure water in contact with the other surface (the
actual condition of the septum in an osmotic experiment), the pure water should
enter the pores from its high capillary attraction, and, like a s0lid piston, force out
the saline solution from them : the saline solution 80 displaced would go to swell the
liquid within the osmometer. When the pure water, now again occupying the pores,
came in time to acquire salt by diffusion, the displacement would be repeated, and a
continuous osmose or flow of water inwards be in fact established. This explanation is attended with certain physical difficulties, but it is unnecessary
to discuss these, as the experimental basis of the hypothesis is unsound. The great
inequality of capillarity assumed among aqueous fluids does not exist.
