S Having described the experiments in which the gases of normal blood and of blood
= treated with nitrites were extracted by ebullition in vacuo, I shall point out the facts
<= which were either confirmed or made out in these experiments.
E Three of the analyses illustrate the composition and quantity of the gases obtained
from healthy blood ; from these it will be seen that venous blood taken directly from
'Z the right side of the heart yielded 9:19 cub. centims. (at 0* C. and 1 metre pressure) of
= oxygen for every 100 cub. centims., that the amount obtained from two samples of arte-
| 5 rialized blood was 18:14 and 15:64 cub. centims. (at 0* C. and 1 metre) for every 100
A ub. centims. of blood. The addition of nitrites to well-arterialized blood was shown to
lead to an enormous diminution in the amount of oxygen which could be removed by
the pump; the amount of oxygen obtained being lowest in the case where the nitrite
” had been in contact with blood during the longest time, and highest when the nitrite
| was added to the blood only a short time before its exhaustion. A s8ample of blood
which yielded 18:148 vols. of oxygen per 100 vols. of blood, after the addition of nitrite
