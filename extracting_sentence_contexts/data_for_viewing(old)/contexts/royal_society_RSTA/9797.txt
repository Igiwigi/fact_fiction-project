not probable that the error is one of observation. In Group 2 the Zn sub-group can
be reproduced fairly well with a formula in #/(2m—1) in which « is negative. Mg
can also be reproduced within error limits by a formula of the same kind, but it is
impossible to do so for Ca, and Sr and Ba require additional terms in 1/m*. Tn
Group 3 Al is quite intractable, and if really depending on a formula, appears to
require complicated algebraic or circular functions. In and Tl also are not amenable
to formule in «/m only or alm+]/m?. Nevertheless, the general build of the series
is so similar to that of the others that it would seem probable that the wave numbers
should also be of the form 8(«)—N/(m+d,,). If so it is possible to calculate d,,
from the observations and a comparative study may throw some light on the origin of
the different lines. The attempt to deal with these series from the formule point of
view, however, brought out the fact that the satellites are related to the strong lines
in a similar way to that in which the Principal line doublets are, viz., by a constant
difference in the denominators and that their differences probably depend on
multiples of the “oun,” as is the ease in the Principal series. As the evidence
depends also on a comparison of the numerical values of d,,, this point will also be
considered now.

The actual values of d,, will depend on the accuracy of the value S (c) (or D())
of the limit. In the calculations below the most probable value has been used (see
note under each element) and the true value has been taken to be that +¢ In order
to be free from mental bias these have been in general taken to be the same as § (0),
which involves the theorem that D(«)=S(). But of this little doubt can be felt.
The true values of d. nt ké where & is small. For
