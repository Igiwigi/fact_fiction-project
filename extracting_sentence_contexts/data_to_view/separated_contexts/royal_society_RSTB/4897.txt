450 MR. J. BARCROFT AND OTHERS: OBSERVATIONS UPON THE EFFECT OF

had ever suffered from “ soroche,” and all had diffusion coefticients for oxygen 40. One
of them, indeed, Mr. Rogers, formerly a trained college athlete and long-distance
runner, was found to have the highest coefficient yet recorded for a man at rest—65°3. While discussing these studies upon completely acclimatised individuals, it is
desirable to draw attention to the fact that the values for the specific permeability,
calculated at the mean capacity, are in all of these persons rather high, and in the
cases of two of them (Messrs. Cuthbertson and Rogers) very high indeed. On the
other hand, their lung measurements are by no means remarkably different from the
usual ones found in men of similar general physique at sea-level. The interesting
question arises as to what influence, if any, life at high altitudes may have in increasing
the specific permeability of the lungs.
