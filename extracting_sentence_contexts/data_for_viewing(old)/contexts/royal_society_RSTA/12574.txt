This large difference in the case of aldehyde points to the difference in constitutio
hetween the mldehydes and the ketones, as the value of oxygen used in obtaining thi
ealeulated number is that of ketonie oxygen. The difference is to be aseribed to th
fact that different values have to be given to carbonyl in the groups
