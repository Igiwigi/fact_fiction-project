This follows from the fact that the maximum (minimum) at any point P of (S—S’)
is unaffected by the values of the function at the points of 8’, since P is not a limiting
point of 8’. Whence the result is easily deduced. The fact that the value at a point of an upper (lower) semi-continuous function is
the maximum (minimum) at that point in the case of such a function, enables us to
substitute the word value instead of maximum (minimum) in the definition of
integration. ‘

The definition in this case takes the following simplified form :—

Divide the fundamental set S into a finite or countably infinite number of
measurable components, multiply the content of each component by the wpper (lower)
limit of the values of an upper (lower) semi-continuous function at points of that
component and sum all such products; then the lower (upper) limit of all such
