70. With the apparatus in its ordinary state, the following are the dimensions of
the several principal elements of the luminous spectrum, which it will be necessary to
bear in mind as data in the experiments to be detailed. They are given in parts of a
scale each equal to th of an inch, and are reckoned from a point, selected as a fiducial
centre, at that particular definite yellow which the cobalt glass above noticed insn-
lates in great abundance and with considerable sharpness of termination*. It was
not mere caprice which determined me to depart in this particular instance from my
hitherto invariable standard, the extreme red ray. The solar image in that ray is
far better defined than in the yellow in question. But from many phenomena ob-
served in the action of coloured glasses I was led to suspect, and the suspicion was
borne out by the results, that this ray may be considered as marking a sort of che-
mical centre, a point of equilibrium, or rather of change of action, in the spectrum.
In fact, in a large proportion of the preparations submitted to the action of the spec-
trum, that action, as far as it is marked on the paper by traces of darkness, termi-
nates precisely, or very nearly indeed, at this point, allowing for the sun's diameter.
