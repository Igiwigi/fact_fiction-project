incomplete unless ample time be allowed. This question was tested by taking two
successive cooling-curves of the same alloy, the first when the alloy had been rapidly
heated to about 180° C. and allowed to cool at once, the second when the alloy had
been kept hot for an hour and a half before the cooling was allowed to begin. The
two curves are shown in fig. 12, and it will be seen that while the recalescence is
observed in both cases, it is very feeble in the first case and quite well-marked in the
second. The resulting conclusion that the change on heating is gradual is further
borne out by the appearance of the heating-curves of these alloys. These are not
reproduced, since they show nothing well defined ; apparently the change on heating
is very gradual and is therefore spread out over a wide range of temperature, merely
producing slight slopes in the various curves.

Another fact which appears to be connected with the same properties of the
substances involved is found in the alloys lying between 8 and 16 per cent. of tin.
In these alloys the temperature at which the evolution of heat occurs on cooling
depends upon the time for which they have been exposed to a temperature of 175° C.,
i.e., the alloys which have been kept at that temperature for six weeks show the
arrest-point at a lower temperature than those which have only been kept hot for
four weeks, while these in turn show the arrest-points at lower temperatures than
those which have been simply slowly cooled from the molten state ; still more rapidly-
cooled alloys show the point at still higher temperatures. The results of a number
of experiments on this point are plotted in the diagram of fig. 13. The explanation
for these observations is probably to be found in the formation of concentric layers
of solid solutions of different concentrations in more rapidly-cooled alloys. The
temperature at which the recalescence occurs depends upon the concentration of tin
