the blue and violet rays cannot operate under the destructive action of the red rays ;
this fact proves then evidently, that if the red radiation has a photogenic effect, it
cannot be due to the same principle which produces the photogenic effect of the rays
Situated at the other extremity of the spectrum. The yellow glass has also a pecu-
liar photogenic action of its own, it is a hundred times slower than that of white
light, whilst its destructive action is not more than ten times as slow. We can ob-
tain by the photogenic action of the yellow glass an image almost identical, as to
force and colour, with an image produced by daylight ; with this difference, that the
excess of action does not give the blue solarization which we observe upon plates
strongly affected by daylight.

'The different nature of the photogenic action of red, orange and yellow glasses,
from that of the daylight, is also proved by the fact, that the photogenic action pro-
duced by these coloured glasses cannot be destroyed by their own reversing action,
although the red will destroy the photogenic action of the yellow, and both of these
will destroy the action of daylight.

'The double property of producing and destroying a photogenie effect is manifested
upon a specimen which offers on one-half of the plate a negative image, and upon
the other half a positive image, produced at the same time by the same radiation.
The length of time necessary to operate with the red glass has not allowed me to
obtain a good impression, but I have succeeded perfectly with the yellow glass. The
experiment is especially beautiful, and has been thus made :â€”

I exposed one-half of the plate to daylight for one second, keeping the other half
