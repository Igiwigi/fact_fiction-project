We may arrive at the notion of the inverse or reciprocal matrix, directly from the
equation

(X,Y, Z)=( «,0,c Xn,y,2),
ds axe.

in fact this equation gives n
(z, 9, 2)=C A, A, A" XX, Y,Z)=(( a,4, e Y "XX, Y,2),

and we have, for the determination of the coefficients of the inverse or reciprocal matrix,
the equations

(AA AYe,d,c)=(1,0,0),

(a,4,cXAA,A”J=( 1,0, 0 ),

which are equivalent to each other, and either of them is by itself sufficient for the com-

plete determination of the inverse or reciprocal matrix. It is well known that if

then the terms of the inverse or reciprocal matrix are given by the equations

or what is the same thing, the inverse or reciprocal matrix is given by the equation

(4,4, = _1CDY, dV, dV )

where of course the differentiations m
