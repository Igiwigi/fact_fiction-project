In his paper Â© On the Colouring Matters of Madderf,
Mr. Hiccin has detailed his experiments on that peculiar substance discovered in
madder by KUnLiMaxN and called by him Xanthine. I have shown, on a former occa-
Sion, that the xanthine of Kunimany and other investigators is not a pure substance,
but a mixture of two distinct substances. This fact however does not affect the cor-
rectness of Mr, Hiccin's conclusions, the general 'accuracy of which I shall have
great, pleasure in confirming in the course of this paper. The presence of xanthine
is easily ascertained by the deep yellow colour and intensely bitter taste which it
communicates to cold water. Guided by these two tests, Mr. Hiccix arrived at the
concInsion, that in an infusion of madder, made with cold or tepid water, when left
to itself, or more rapidly when heated to 120? or 130?
