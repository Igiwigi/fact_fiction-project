But the affinities
Sf the vitriolic acid air with various ſubſtances, and many
of the phenomena attending it, are ftrikingly different
Jrom thoſe of the marine acid air. I thought it a little
Singular, that the ſolution of iron, zinc, and tin, in a di-
Juted vitriolic acid ſhould yield inflammable air; and that
5 hen boiled in the ſame acid concentrated, they ſhould
chiefly yield acid air, which is not at all inflammable,
{ > cannot be confined by water. This, however, is in
Fact the produce of the proceſs; and the very fame as-
(1 hen copper, ſilver, or quickfilver is boiled in the ſame
acid. From gold, platina, or lead, I was not able to pro-
| ure any air at all by this means,
