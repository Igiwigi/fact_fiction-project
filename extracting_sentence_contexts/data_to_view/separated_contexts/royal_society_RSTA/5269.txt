It may, therefore, be called at rest. hether it is in absolute rest or not appears to be a question which can hardly be
put into an intelligible shape. If it be moving relatively to itself, we have in those

hat its properties in free space are uniform, so it is natural to assume that its motion
here, whatever it is, is perfectly uniform, and it may be defined as absolute rest. Vhen I speak of the ether anywhere as “stationary,” I mean stationary with respect
