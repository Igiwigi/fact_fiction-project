â€˜The thyroid cartilages, when seen from the ventral side, show that
each possesses a pair of processes directed ventrally, one behind the other. The only
interpretation of this condition seems to be that the thyroid cartilage represents the
skeletal elements of two visceral arches, viz., the 4th and 5th. This will account for
the two processes or wings, one corresponding to each arch, and it will also explain the
fact that the thyroid cartilage is larger than the skeletal elements of the other visceral]
arches. In this respect, therefore, the rabbit may be regarded as falling into line with
Monotremes and Marsupials, in possessing thyroid cartilages composed of the elements
of two visceral arches. Whether in remaining Eutheria, in all of which the thyroid carti-
lages have been supposed to consist of one visceral arch only, the conditions resemble
those of the rabbit can only be decided by further investigation, probable though it
may seem.
