well as in the linear interplay between the two electrophysiological series, particularly in the :s
heart-to-brain direction and the HRV-LF and EEG-y frequency bands [12]. â€˜Ss

Here, more pronounced differences between the two experimental conditions are evident
at higher EEG bands, particularly the y range, and, for the cardiovascular system, the HRV-
LF band and bispectral features. The results presented here confirm the complexity of the BHI
phenomenon and, speculatively, we suggest that this arises from multiple responses associated
with timing, scalp regions and directionality, which underlies bodily reactions to the allostatic
state in order to re-establish homeostasis.

It should be noted that the proposed framework contains few limitations. First, the use of MIC
does not allow the directionality of the functional brain-heart coupling to be assessed; the MIC,
in fact, does not allow for such a causal inference, although it assesses statistical independence
and quantifies linear and nonlinear couplings between the system outputs. Second, the statistical
power of the comparison between experimental sessions is dependent on the number of EEG
sensors, thus limiting the investigation of specific brain areas associated with cardiac interplay.

To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to extend the quantitative assessment of
functional BHI to the MF domain.

We conclude that the co-occurrence of MF behaviours between brain and heartbeat dynamics
does exist, namely the functional BHI in the MF domain through cumulants and non-Gaussian
expansions, and that they vary following sympathovagal changes induced by peripheral stress,
such as that experienced during a CPT.
