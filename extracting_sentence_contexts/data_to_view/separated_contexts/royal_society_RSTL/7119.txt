The very considerable discrepancies presented by the results of independent investi-
gations are unquestionably due, in part, to the difficulties which have to be encountered
in attempts to obtain trustworthy analytical results from so highly explosive a material
as gun-cotton. The methods of analysis which have been adopted have been almost as
numerous as the formule deduced from their results; and in several instances the quan-
tity of materia] operated upon has been too small to permit of the attainment of satis-
factory results by methods in which the sources of error were not inconsiderable. There is no doubt, however, that the different conclusions arrived at by many talented
chemists with regard to the composition of gun-cotton, are to be mainly ascribed to
the fact that the treatment of cotton-wool with nitric acid, or a mixture of nitric and
sulphuric acids, has furnished, in the hands of different operators, products differing
considerably in compoxsition. 'That such is the case is clearly indicated by the state-
ments made in several of the published researches with regard to the increase of weight
sustained by the cotton upon treatment with acid. Thus PELoUzZE, in his first paper on
the compoxsition of pyroxylin, states that he found the increase of weight constantly
comprised between 68 and 70 per cent. In his next publication he fixes the increase of
weight at between 74 and 76 per cent., the theoretical increase, according to the formula

which he fixed upon, being 74-9 per cent.; and Von KIRCHHory and REUTER obtained an
increase of 76 per cent.
