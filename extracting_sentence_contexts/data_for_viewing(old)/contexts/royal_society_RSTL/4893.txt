it to be well shown, for the observations of page 184 show that the lowest portion of

winter, a hollow iron shell be filled with water and exposed to the frost with the fuze-hole uppermost, a por-
tion of the water expands in freezing, 80 as to protrude a cylinder of ice from the fuze-hole ; but if the ex-
periment be continued, the cylinder continues to grow, inch by inch, in proportion as the central nucleus of
water freezes. © In the first instance,” says Mr. Canreris, * a hell of ice containing water was formed, no
doubt, within the iron shell, and the fuze-hole might be filled by the expansion of the water in the act of
freezing; 80 that there may be no reason for attributing plasticity to the ice as far as this goes ; but the shell
of ice once formed, and the fuze-hole filled with ice, the subsequent rise of the ice must, have proceeded from
the ice of the interior shell being =zqueezed through the narrow orifice. No thawing took place during the
process. Does not this show plasticity even in very small masses of ice?” I have also been lately informed,
on excellent authority, that in a new work by a most eminent German mineralogist, the plastic character of
ice in masses is aszumed as an admitted fact. In corroboration of what has been aid in the text, I may farther
add, that whilst these sheets are passing through the press, I obserye in the Athenzum (June 20, 1846), an
account of a patent process for moulding solid tin into tubes and other utensils, in the course of which it is
*tated that ** tin under a pressure of about twenty tons to a circular inch, will run according to the law of
fluids.”
