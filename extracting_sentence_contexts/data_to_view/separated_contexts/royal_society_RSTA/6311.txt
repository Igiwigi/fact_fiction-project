Indeed, the three-level structure in zonal flow implied by figure 2 requires some sloping-down
of isopycnals as they approach their outcrop latitude. Nevertheless, we assume level isopycnals
equatorward of the outcropping latitude for analytical convenience. Note that level isopycnals at
the eastern boundary were also assumed in the famous ventilated-thermocline theory of Luyten
et al. [34], a fact overlooked in Marotzke [25]. Our assumptions result in a picture of the density structure resembling ‘stacked boxes’, a term
coined by Jeff Scott (figure 3). The stacked boxes allow us to calculate the meridional overturning
circulation, once the basic stratification parameter—thermocline depth D—is known.
