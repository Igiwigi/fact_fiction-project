(107) The accuracy of measurements of visual acuity

Those familiar with the technique of measuring visual acuity know how difficult it is to
obtain a sharp end-point in such determinations. As the angle subtended by the test object
at the observerâ€™s eye is made smaller, it becomes increasingly difficult for him to make
correct estimates. Fixation has to be made with greater precision, and the eye has to be
more accurately focused. In addition, the times required for judgements become more and
more prolonged. The result is that fatigue may cause mistakes to be made long before the
visual limit is approached. Further, when the limit is nearly reached, mistakes usually do
not increase in a regular manner with decrease in the visual angle of the test object. These
facts make the precise determination of visual acuity difficult. In order to decrease fatigue,
and in consequence to increase accuracy, the following method may sometimes be adopted.

In the case of a letter of the alphabet, or a character similar to it, its diagonal is measured
to the nearest millimetre. The observer now places himself at a distance from the test object
equal to one thousand times the diagonal. Thus, if the diagonal of the test letter be 19 mm.,
he places himself 19 m. away from the test object. His observations are now recorded, and
if found to be accurate the distance is doubled, and so on. If, on the contrary, they are

found to be inaccurate, then the distance is halved. Having in this way found the critical
