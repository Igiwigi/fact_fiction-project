accurately deducible from a series of measurements at radio-frequencies from which
the capacitances of the system are found (HarrsHorn, 1926). The quantity
AR, the amount by which the resistance of the secondary mesh at 100 cycles per
second exceeds its resistance to direct current, is determined by a comparison of
the circuit with a high-frequency inductance standard, the properties of which are
also determinable from radio-frequency measurements.

The corrections due to / and 4 do not vary with the connexions of the inductive
coils. The quantities AM,, AM,, AR, and o, differ, however, by small amounts
for the eight connexions used (see p. 433). This is due to the fact that they are
largely determined by the capacitances of the system, which alter with the different
connexions. These four quantities are also functions of the frequency, varying very
nearly as the square of the frequency. The corrections are very much larger, and
so determinable with correspondingly higher accuracy, at higher frequencies.
Measurements of these quantities were made, therefore, not only at the working
frequency but also over a range of audio-frequencies, and curves were drawn
showing the various corrections as functions of frequency. The values corresponding
to the working frequency were then read from these curves.

Table III gives the values of the various correcting terms, together with the
contribution made by them to the final result (7.Â¢., the ratio of the international to
the absolute ohm). The corrections are given without regard to sign, the purpose
