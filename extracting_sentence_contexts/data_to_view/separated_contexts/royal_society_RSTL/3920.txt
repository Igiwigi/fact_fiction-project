On exciting the contractions of the entive frog by
making the current pass through its lumbar plexuses, I have seen in many instances
three galvanoscopic frogs contract, and all with nearly the same vivacity. The con-
tractions are never wanting in two frogs, but I have never been able to perceive four
contracted. There is therefore an induced contraction of the first, the second, and
the third rank, Before coming to the consequences to be drawn from the aboye-

mentioned facts, it remains to me to describe the many experiments I have made for
the purpose of discovering the influence of bodies interposed between the muscle in
contraction and the nerve of the galvanoscopic frog upon the induced contraction. From my first experiments upon the induced contraction, I had perceived that on
extending a sheet of gold leaf, such as is used for gilding, upon the mnscle, and then
placing the nerve of the galvanoscopic frog upon the gilded musele, the induced
contraction did not take place. That this should happen, it was necessary that the
muscle should be completely coated with the gold leaf, which is not the case after
one or two contractions when the gold leaf gets torn.
