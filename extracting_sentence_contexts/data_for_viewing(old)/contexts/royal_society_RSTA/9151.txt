is certainly sufficiently close to permit us to say that these simple energy relations
express the experimental facts exceedingly well for a first approximation. It should
be observed that the recorded values are not simply relative values; each one is the
result of an absolute determination in the sense that it is independent of the others,
and might have had any value less than unity. There appears to be little loss of
energy within the atom, but what there is appears most marked when » is just less
