below) and, as a result, will display phase bistability.

On a more formal basis, rocking can be explained in terms of a mechanical analogy, which
historically was the line of reasoning that led to the discovery of rocking and led to its name.
A simple way to visualize a (single) nonlinear oscillator is to use a mechanical analogy, in which
the real and imaginary parts of the complex oscillation amplitude are interpreted as the two
Cartesian coordinates q = (q1,q2) of a fictitious massless particle affected by viscous damping
and under the action of a potential V having the form of a Mexican sombrero (see figure 1). The
maximum of V at the origin corresponds to the unstable off state (of null oscillation amplitude)
and its degenerate minimum (the ‘valley’) to the self-oscillating state of finite amplitude (figure 1).
The degeneracy of the minimum signals the phase invariance of the free oscillations, as no
angle is preferred. Now, imagine that we rock” that potential in a periodic way around some
axis, say qz, and that rocking is sufficiently fast. Where would the fictitious particle tend to
rest (remind that the particle motion is damped)? It is evident that this would happen at the
quietest regions, where the rocking of the potential produces less perturbation, i.e. around any of
the ‘poles’ symmetrically located along the q2-axis (figure 1). Then, an initially phase invariant
oscillator would end up being a phase-bistable one! Note that this phase bistability requires,
in this picture, a potential with a maximum (an unstable point) at the origin, as otherwise
there are not two separated, quiet regions. The simplest ‘rocked’ potential displaying the above
features reads
