Therefore, the probe has a high sensitivity to the variation of eddy current corresponding to the
waviness and shows the highest performance in both accuracy and precision. On the other hand, even though CirD also has directional eddy current distribution, this probe
shows a larger RMSE than SymD and UniD. The difference in the error is due to the fact that eddy
current near the pickup coils is not perfectly directional and has non-uniform distribution even
in this narrow range. Therefore, the ECT signal cannot follow the change of electric resistance
faithfully with high spatial resolution, leading to larger errors in the contour map. SymD has
stronger directional eddy current than CirD.
