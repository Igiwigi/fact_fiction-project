MOLECULAR CONSTITUTION OF THE VOLATILE ORGANIC BASES. 127

the production of which, as mentioned in the commencement of this paper, I have in
vain attempted by the action of the phenyl-alcohol at high temperatures upon aniline. The view which I propose in the preceding remarks respecting the constitution of
toluidine, xylidine and cumidine, must as yet be considered as a mere hypothesis. It will not however be difficult to establish it by facts. The action of bromide of
ethyl upon these substances will at once decide this question. These bases, when
subjected to the influence of the bromides, will give rise to the formation of a series
of bases similar to those which I have obtained from aniline.
