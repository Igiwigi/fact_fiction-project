[20] used a subclass of well-posed systems, called regular systems, Tauberian theorems and
the operator C, to give a representation to the input-output operator F. The latter is defined
as in (2.10) and helps to develop a complete feedback theory of regular linear systems [20]. A
generalization of the Weiss regular system to the Banach setting is given in Staffans [21]. In
our discussion above, we only cited the founders of the theory of well-posed systems. Here,
we also cite Jacob & Partington [22] for the admissibility of observation of Volterra equations,
Jacob & Zwart [23] for well-posed Hamiltonian systems, Hadd [24] and Schnaubelt [25] for
regular non-autonomous systems.


The purpose of the present work is twofold: firstly, in §2, we give a simple exposition of the
feedback theory of regular linear systems. To this end, we mainly use operator theory to facilitate
the task to the semigroup community. In fact, the interaction between semigroups and the theory
of feedback of regular systems [20] theories lies in perturbation theory [26, Chap. III]. For example,
the case of Miyadera—Voigt perturbation can be seen as the feedback of a system (A, Ix, C), where
C is an admissible observation operator for A, while the Desch-Schappacher perturbation as a
result of the feedback of a system (A,B,C), where C is a bounded operator from X to U and
B:U-— X_, is an admissible control operator for A. The feedback theory of general regular linear
systems coincides with the problem of unbounded perturbations of the generator domain. In fact,
to visualize this connection, define an operator Ay C Am with domain D(A) = {x € D(Am) : Gx =
Mx}, where G,M:Z Cc X > X, Am: Z— X is an operator such that A= Am with domain D(A) =
ker G is the generator of a strongly continuous semigroup T on X. We see that M is a perturbation
of the domain of A. As we will see in the next section, the generation property of Ajy is related to
the existence of a regular system with admissible feedback. This was proved in [27] and applied to
the heat equation with an unbounded delay at the boundary. On the other hand, the exponential
