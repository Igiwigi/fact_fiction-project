In the days before systematic genomic sequencing was a
possibility, Woese and Fox applied an early technique that allowed them to compare the sequence
of selected short segments of DNA from different organisms [13]. As they were after a way
to classify all forms of life, their analysis was restricted to those genes shared by every cell,
thus underlying the most essential features of biological systems. Eventually, they compared
sequences of a ribosome subunit gene, the 16S rRNA found in prokaryotes, which revealed the
astounding fact that life is separated into three main domains: Bacteria, Archaea and Eukaryota. This discovery had several paramount consequences across all areas of biology, two of which are
particularly relevant for the remainder of the paper: (i) the fact that species can be operatively
defined on the basis of similarities of the 16S rRNA and (ii) a minimalistic history of life, as
represented in figure 1. The top of the figure shows that, at present day, life is divided into
three domains.
