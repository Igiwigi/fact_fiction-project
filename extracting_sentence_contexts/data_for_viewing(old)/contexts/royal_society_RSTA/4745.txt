the materials called for in the present FT design have many desirable features, namely broad
bandwidth; desirable loss and dispersion characteristics; and desirable levels of insensitivity to
angle of incidence and polarization, as shown below in this paper.

2. Field transformation in the context of generalized scattering matrix approach

When designing an electromagnetic device, such as a lens antenna, we typically begin with a

given source, such as a feed horn, and specify that the field radiated by the horn be transformed : =
into a planar phase front, for instance. As is well known, this task is easily accomplished by : Sy
placing the feed horn at the focal point of a conventional convex or plano-convex lens, and the a
procedure for designing such a lens based on the ray optics (RO) approach is well established in aed
the literature; in fact, it is a just a textbook case. : a

The situation is different when we stipulate that the shape of the lens be flat instead of ne]
convex. To address this problem, the TO algorithm offers an elegant recipe based on transforming : fa
the geometry of the original convex lens into a planar one. The TO algorithm then shows us : =
how to derive the requisite material parameters of the planar lens by using well-established : &

relationships [6] between the ¢ and y values of the original convex lens and its surrounding
medium, and those of its planar counterpart. These relationships involve the Jacobians of the
geometry transformation and are relatively straightforward to find, even for arbitrary geometries
being transformed from the real space to virtual space. The caveat, though, is that the ¢ and w
values are anisotropic in general, and may be difficult if not virtually impossible to realize in
practice. It is not uncommon, therefore, to set the values equal to ju, i.e. that of free space, to
