Up to the present time Populus tremula is the only plant in which
intumescences have been formed in darkness, and we seem therefore to be justified
in assuming, until further experimental evidence is forthcoming, that Populus is in
this respect exceptional. It is abundantly clear from all the experiments that
assimilation is a most important factor in the formation of intumescences, and yet it
is one to which little attention has been paid by most of those working at this
subject. The fact which, more than any other, shows that assimilation is an
essential factor is that intumescences are never formed under water because land
plants cannot assimilate under water. The fact that the leaves of Populus tremula
alone, so far as is known, form intumescences in the absence of light, may probably
prove to be due to the presence of some special substance in the leaves. This
question is referred to again on p. 252.
