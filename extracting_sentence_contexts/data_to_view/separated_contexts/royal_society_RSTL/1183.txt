For the purpose of proving that the constitution of
this compound has been rightly ascertained, the salt thus
formed should be purified by a second crystallization in dis-
tilled water ; after which the alkali of thirty grains must be
obtained by exposure to a red heat, in order to neutralize the
redundant acid contained in ten grains of the same salt. The

quantity of unburned salt contains alkali for one part out of

four of the acid present, and it requires the alkali of three
equal quantities of the same salt to saturate the three remain-
ing parts of acid." :

The limit tothe 'decomposition of 8uper-oxalate of potash
by the above acids, is analogous" to that which occurs when
sulphate of potash'is decomposed'by nitric acid ; for" in this
case also, no quantity of that acid can take more than half the
potash, and the remaining salt is converted into a definite
sper-sulphate, similar' to that obtained by heat-in the third
experiment,

It is not improbable that many'other changes in chemistry,
supposed'to'be influenced” by a general redundance of some
one ingredient; may in fact be/limited by a new' order of affi-
nities taking place at some definite proportion tobe expressed
by a simple multiple. And though'the' strong power of crys-
tallizing in oxalic acid, renders the modifications of which its
combinations are '$usceptible more distinet than" those of other
acids, it seems probable that a" similar'play of affinities will
arise in $olution, when other acids" exceed their base in the
same proportion. In order tg determine whether' oxalic acid is capable of
uniting to potash in a proportion intermediate between the
double 'and quadruple quantity of acid, I neutralized forty-
eight grains of carbonate of potash with thirty grains of oxalic
acid, and added sixty grains more of acid, 80 that I had two
parts of potash of twenty-four grains each, and six equivalent

quantities” of oxalic acid of fifteen grains each, in solution,
ready to crystallize together, if disposed to unite, in the pro-
portion of three to one ; but the first portion of salt that crys-
tallized, was the common binoxalate, or salt of sorrel, and a

portion elected from the after crystals (which differed very
discernibly in their form) was found to contain the. quadruple
proportion of acid.
