This thermal rescue can therefore relax the bounds on the Huble rate derived in the previous
section, as shown in figure 10, for two different values of the instability scale, as measured
by Imax. The fate of the different Hubble patches becomes even more interesting if the Higgs field
has a non-zero coupling & to gravity or couples directly to the inflaton field through c|H|?Â¢",
as discussed in the previous section as a way of relaxing the bounds on Hj. During preheating,
such couplings can in fact destabilize the Higgs potential (even in those patches that lie in the safe
region of the potential). The reason is that, when the inflaton field oscillates around its minimum,
those oscillations lead to an oscillating (or tachyonic) mass term for the Higgs field and this can
induce parametric (or tachyonic) resonant production of Higgses that build up a classical field
value that grows with Hy. Once again, if Hy is comparable or larger than the instability scale, this
triggers vacuum decay.
