adheres firmly to their distal surfaces. In this situation they are snbject to a greater
chance of pressure and disruption than the more deeply seated ones of Geodia, and
accordingly we find extra provisions for the safety of the junctions of their radii. The
shafts of these spicula are short, stout, and conical, and they penetrate but a yery short
distance into the substance of the sgponge. They do not appear to be cemented to any
part of the rigid siliceo-fibrous skeleton, but are merely plunged into a somewhat thick
stratum of membranous structure reposing on the surface of the skeleton. Their radii
are compressed considerably and extended laterally, so that their planes are in accord-
ance with that of the dermal membrane, and they present a greater amount of adhesive
surface than those having cylindrical radii, 'The ternate rays ramity irregularly. Some-
times one ramus, after Slightly pullulating, remains nearly obsolete, causing the branch
to asxume a geniculated form like some of the ramifications of a Deer's horn, and no
two appear to be exactly alike ; in fact there is every appearance that each ray is
influenced and modified in its deyelopment by the necessities of combination with the
adjoining spicula, and their apices are directed in snch a manner that they lap over each
other in opposing lines, 80 that each two form a spliced joint, giving a much greater
amount of strength than the mere crossing of the radii at various angles as in those
of Geodig. The inhalant areas thus formed appear to differ very slightly from those
of Halichondria panicea, in each of which seyeral pores are opened, while those
of Dactylocalya Prattii seem to be devoted each to a gmaller number (Plate XXIX.
figs. 8 & 9).
