This result stems largely from the lack of the four-body term which,
according to figure 15a and the DMBE/ES/SS-(2 + 3) PES, is estimated to be as repulsive as
376k} molâ„¢! at this geometry. Similar magnitudes of four-body interaction energies have been
reported for X4-type elemental clusters such as Hy [120,185] and Oy [186]. In fact, for ground-
state C3, the three-body energy is known [35,116,185] to strongly favour the linear structure:
it is attractive in this region, but repulsive (or less attractive) as the molecule bends, in such a
way as to counteract the increased attraction of the two-body terms. Thus, at D3, geometries, a
minimum of the latter is accompanied by a maximum in energy of the former. Ongoing from C3
to C4, the two-body terms are doubled in number, while the three-body terms are quadrupled.
