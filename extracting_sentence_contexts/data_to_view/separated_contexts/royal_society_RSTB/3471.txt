This condition is illustrated
A in Hit and Marrin’s figs. 2 and 3, Plate 10. In their fig. 3 the optic groove
S is very evident. In their fig. 2, however, the concavity there shown is incorrectly
© lettered “op. gr.” In point of fact, this section passes wholly in front of the
© anterior horn of the longitudinally (or paraxially) crescentic optic groove. This
o anterior extremity of the optic groove really fades away insensibly into the general
5 concavity of the up-standing medullary fold of the fore-brain region. It is this
‘9 latter concavity which is wrongly designated as the optje groove in fig. 2 of Hit
5 and Marrw’s paper.
‘5 In front of the connection of the base of the Trigeminus ganglionic lobe with the
4 medullary plate in the region of the fifth prefacial neuromere, no further ganglionic
> outgrowth or connection is met with.
