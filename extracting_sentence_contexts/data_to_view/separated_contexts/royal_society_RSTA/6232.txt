The more robust reconstruction for the 1990s
may be related to the distribution of observations in pCO? space, which is not skewed towards
low pCO} values in the period 1982-1999 in our analysis (figure 3). Even with the ideal sampling scheme, the mean Southern Ocean flux is consistently
overestimated by about 0.2 PgC yr~! in MPI-SOM-FEN. This seems to be a methodological issue
that may be related to the fact that MPI-SOM-FEN aims to minimize the global mismatch with
SOCAT observations. While regional pCO, biases average out in the first 20 years of the time-
series (figure 7), the local pCO, biases in high wind speed regions do not compensate in terms of
CO> flux (figure 6). Further, the biogeochemical provinces that merge regions from different parts
of the globe with similar environmental conditions may contribute as well [23].
