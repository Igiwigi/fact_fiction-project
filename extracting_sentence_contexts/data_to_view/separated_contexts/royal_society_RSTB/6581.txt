There is a much
smaller cuneus and the arcus intercuneatus is much more frequently exposed. In
the examination of some hundreds of Chinese hemispheres, although there are cases
of vertical folding, I have not met with any specimens showing collections of primitive
features such as the Australian brain does. These facts make one hopeful that a
definite basis for racial classification may be obtained from the whole features of the
brain, but it is certain that such a basis cannot be obtained with reference to indivi-
dual features. S.5.R. (Plate 19)—FLasHMman’s description of this hemisphere is very accurate and
