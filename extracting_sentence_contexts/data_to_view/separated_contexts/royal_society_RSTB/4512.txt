Both
from their history and their actual manner of life, these “fresh-water eels” are
true oceanic fishes, and the remarkable point in their life-history is not so much
the fact of their migrating out into the sea to spawn, as in their leaving it in
order to pass their period of growth in an environment so unusual for mureenoid
fishes as fresh-water. I have in the foregoing pages described the course of our investigations, and set
forth their results. In conclusion, I will endeavour very briefly to give an outline of
the life-history of our eel, as indicated by the facts now ascertained. During the autumn months, the silvery eels leave the lakes and rivers and move
out into the sea. Once beyond fresh-water limits, the eels are, in most parts of
Europe, outside our range of observation.
