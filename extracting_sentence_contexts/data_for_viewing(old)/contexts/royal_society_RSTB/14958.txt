(d) Evaluating appropriateness of citations of Moynihan
Our quantification of citation frequencies of different papers
revealed that Moynihan stood out in multiple ways in its impact
on ideas around nuclearity in flocks (see 3a and 3c below).
Therefore, we decided to specifically evaluate the nature and
appropriateness of citations of this paper in relation to nuclearity.
We classified the 149 text segments that cited Moynihan into four
categories based on nature of attribution (electronic supplemen-
tary material, table S3). Out of 149 text segments, 87 (58%) made
it explicit that Moynihan was being attributed for an idea, hypoth-
esis or speculation (‘author's idea’ category). Out of 149 text
segments, 43 (29%) were written as if attributing to Moynihan a
fact about nature that was universally true (’fact about nature’ cat-
egory). Out of 149 segments, 12 (8%) made it clear that Moynihan
was being cited for an empirical finding (‘research finding’ cat-
egory). Out of 149, 6 (4%) credited Moynihan for a method or
approach used (‘method or approach’ category). We did not
assign one segment to a category because the nature of its attribu-
tion was ambiguous.

We did not evaluate appropriateness for 13 out of 149
text segments in which Moynihan was provided as the
basis for the identification of nuclear species; in all these cases,
the information contained in the segments was insufficient
to evaluate appropriateness. We assigned the remaining
