hat the experimental conditions employed by him produced a temperature not
sgreatly differing from that of the are employed at Kensington. There are only a few
‘Blines which are not common to the two series of photographs, and these in many
pases can with great probability be ascribed to impurities present in one case and not
€n the other. Further, the apparent differences of intensity between some of the
Sines which are common, are mostly due to the superposition of the spectrum of air
Arpon that of iron in McCiEan’s photographs. In some cases, however, there seems to
Se a real difference in the intensities of the lines, and this may, with much probability,
be ascribed to the slight difference between the temperature employed at Kensington
Hind that employed by McCray.
¢ (3.) The number of lines mapped by Messrs. Kayser and Runcu is considerably
Ein excess of that mapped at Kensington in corresponding regions of the spectrum.
She comparison indicates that this is partly due to the fact that the iron employed in
Stheir experiments contained a greater number of impurities than that employed at
PE ensington.
© No origins have been traced for many of the lines present in their photographs
which do not appear in the Kensington photographs, and some of these may therefore
be really due to iron, their absence from the Kensington photographs being due to
insufficient exposure or to the employment of a different temperature. The possible
origins of 341 of these excess lines in Kayser and Runce’s list have been traced
from the Kensington maps of metallic arc spectra.

(4.) The impurities which contribute the greatest numbers of fore

spectrum are calcium and manganese.
