AUERBACH, 1891. INVESTIGATED BY THE METHOD OF JET VIBRATION. - 355

This reduction is thus seen to be double that originating from the capillary-pressure
for a water jet with a diameter of 1 mm. becomes /, = circa 3Â°0 cm. This fact has also been the subject of but little attention, though A. Dupri* has
undertaken some interesting experiments about the height to which a jet can rise. A closer examination of how the reduction of velocity corresponding to h, spreads
itself over the jet I am obliged to leave to another opportunity, only a particular
characteristic fact being named here.
