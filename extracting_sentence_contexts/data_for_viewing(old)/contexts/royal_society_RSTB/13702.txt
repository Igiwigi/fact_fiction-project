when the experiment would end. In the first phase, participants
played a Prisonerâ€™s Dilemma game (PD); in the second phase, in
addition to the PD, they had the opportunity to gossip and
evaluate others (figure 1).

(ii) Phase Il: the reliability of gossip and its effect on cooperation
In the second phase of the experiment, participants played the
same PD games as before. In addition, changes were introduced
regarding gossip opportunities and reputation building. After
the PD game, gossip could be sent to a randomly selected partici-
pant (figure 1 or screen 3 in electronic supplementary material,
$2). In each round, participants could send two messages. The
fictitious names of gossip targets and receivers were displayed
on the screen. Participants could select the valence of gossip
from three options indicated by happy, neutral and sad emoti-
cons. We have employed emoticons as they simplify and clarify
the content of reputation scores and translate evaluations into
positive, neutral or negative judgement. Sending gossip was
free and optional and was possible within a limit of 18s.
After the first gossip message, we manipulated how the second
message proceeded (figure 1 and section about manipulation 2).

After the first round in phase II (round 7), players played one
of the PDs with their gossip partner from the previous round.
The other PD partner was the target of gossip from the previous
