question of this interpretation will be more fully discussed with the other specimens.

In §.13.L. the inferior parallel sulcus is separated from the posterior group of
sulci by a submerged gyrus. It is common to find this breaking of the parallel
sulcus at the point where the sulcus ceases to act as the boundary between areas 21
and 22 of BropmMann. The anterior occipital sulcus has the angulated appearance
noted in the previous specimens, and its inferior element has become separated off
and become confluent with the sulcus of the preoccipital notch. The sulcus angu-
laris (25) is confluent with the upper element of the anterior occipital sulcus. The
sulcus parallelus superioris (24) is the branched sulcus which is directed forwards
towards the angle between the sulcus postcentralis inferior and the pars horizontalis.
Comparing this specimen with C.2.L., it is apparent that it is in the supramarginal
gyrus that the difficulties of interpretation are most apparent. In fact, in identifying
the sulci in this region by means of numbers, it is to be pointed out that these
numbers cannot bear the same implications in each brain. The difficulties of
homology are of the same order as those found in identifying such sulci as the sulcus
paramedialis.

In $.13.R. in which the distance between the lower end of the sulcus centralis and
the posterior end of the fissure of Sylvius is short, the complicated nature of the
sulci of the supramarginal region is accentuated and further confirmation is added
to the opinion that it is in the supramarginal region of the Australian that the first
expansions of the inferior parictal lobule take place. - For in this hemisphere the
