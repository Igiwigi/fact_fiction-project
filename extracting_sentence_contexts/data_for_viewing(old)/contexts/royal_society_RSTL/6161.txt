'= ture of the rubber.

S 39. I now reduced the stretching weight to 1 1b., being that of the tube and the
= water contained by it. The observed length was 1:63, and in forty-five minutes further
5 decreased to 1:621. Afterwards it began to increase gradually; in five hours attaining
to 1:635, in seventeen more to 1-724, and after a further lapse of forty hours to 1-751.
These observations were at 7%1. Then raising the temperature to 21*6, the length was
reduced to 1:191; and on depressing it again to 7%4, the length was further reduced to
1:181. Keeping the rubber at the same temperature it still continued to contract, and
in two hours its length was only 1-17, Then on raising the temperature to 23?, and
afterwards depressing it to 7%2, the length was successively reduced to 1:151 and 1141.
These and similar observations were continued for several days with like results, confirm-
ing my previous remarks, and als developing the curious fact, that when a piece of india-
rubber, which has been previously gradually lengthened by stretching, is shortened by
the temporary application of heat, the shortening effect continues to go on for 8ome time,
even if the rubber has been reduced to its previous temperature,

40. Although my experiments, already detailed, on the thermal effects of stretching
india-rubber were not, on account of the imperfect elasticity of that substance at low tem-
peratures, well calculated to give exact numerical results, the Lonary conclusion derived
