104 PROFESSOR F. 0. BOWER ON THE MORPHOLOGY

Ferns at large, does not stand in any constant relation to the segmentation of the
sporangium-mother-cell, though that segmentation itself shows so singular a con-
stancy. This fact leaves the question of a shifting of the annulus more open than
it would otherwise appear. My own opinion is that the annulus of the Leptosporangiate Ferns is homogeneous
throughout; that it has in the course of evolution undergone a shifting, not only
of its position as a whole, but also of the point of dehiscence. That the more primi-
tive type of complete annulus is that seen in the Gleicheniacew and Schizeacese,
with oblique position and median dehiscence; that while Zoasuma maintained the
oblique position and median dehiscence, part of its annulus is incompletely indurated.
