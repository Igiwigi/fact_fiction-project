In §2 of the present paper we develop a different method for describing oblique
propagation of a magneto-ionic component through the ionosphere, avoiding the use
of a refractive index uv which depends in a complicated way upon an unknown angle of
refraction y. This method makes the validity of Schekulin’s result almost obvious. The
explanation of the result depends on the fact that in a doubly refracting medium the
direction of group-propagation in general differs from that of phase-propagation.
Fig. 2 represents only the phase-propagation of a magneto-ionic component, whereas
it is the group-propagation which yields a cuspless ray of more conventional type.
The level of reflexion of a magneto-ionic component is the level where its direction of
group-propagation becomes horizontal. By studying the propagation of wave-packets
through the ionosphere we deduce in §3 that this level is given by the upper cusp in
fig. 2, and not by the lower cusp, which merely gives the level where the direction of
phase-propagation becomes horizontal. The fact that the level of reflexion ofa magneto-

ionic component is not given by the lower cusp in fig. 2 means that it is in general wrong
to deduce the level of reflexion by putting the angle of refraction equal to $7 in Snell’s
Law as we do when the effect of the earth’s magnetic field is neglected (cf. (2)). In §4
consideration is given to the effect of the earth’s magnetic field in producing lateral
deviation of wave-packets during their journey through the ionosphere, and in §5 a
study is made of the effect upon group-propagation of damping due to collisions of the
free electrons with neutral air molecules. § 6 is a review of the phenomena associated with
strata in which the ray theory breaks down in a medium that is structurally slowly
