The curved bands of figure 5, which are indicative of Petschek reconnection,
curve inwards towards the loop axis as one increases or decreases the z coordinate. Figure 5a
is symmetrical about y= 0; thus the top right quadrant is expanded so as to follow the shock
heating in more detail. There are in fact two thin bands of shock heating that appear to trace
the azimuthal magnetic fieldâ€”between the two curved bands the shock heating is minimal. At
this time, there are no super-critical currents around the midplane: Ohmic dissipation is therefore
non-existent within figure 5. If the dissipation of magnetic energy is responsible for the rise in shock heating then these two
events must be connected by the Lorentz force.
