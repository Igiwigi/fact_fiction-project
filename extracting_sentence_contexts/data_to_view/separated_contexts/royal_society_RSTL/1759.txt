On the other
hand, as the rapid circulation of a highly arterialized blood in the brain and
spinal marrow of birds probably conduces to their activity, the slow circu-
lation of a venous blood, doubtless contributes to the lethargy of the hyber-
nating animal.

6. Of the Digestion. There is much difference in the powers of digestion, and in the fact of omit-
ting to take food, in the hybernation of different animals. The bat, being
insectivorous, would awake in vain ; no food could be found: the hedgehog
might obtain snails or worms, if the ground were not very hard from frost :
the dormouse would find less difficulty in meeting with grain and fruits, We
accordingly observe a remarkable difference in the habits of awaking from
their lethargy or hybernation, in these different animals. I have observed no disposition to awake at all in the bat, except from ex-
ternal warmth or excitement.
