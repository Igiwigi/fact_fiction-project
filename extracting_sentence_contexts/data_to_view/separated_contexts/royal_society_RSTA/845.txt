Here, ky =ky(V), my =my(V) and C; are determined by relations (3.3), (3.5) and (3.10),
respectively. Let us note that, in criterion (4.10), we have rescaled only the chemical Péclet number
(the growth Péclet number P, remains unchanged). This is due to the fact that the rescaling
procedure is concerned only with the chemical dendrite selection criterion (the second term in
curly brackets of (4.10)) induced by changing the mass transfer from parabolic to hyperbolic. The selection parameter (4.10) has only the thermal contribution in the rapid solidification limit
W >1(V= Vp) when the concentration distribution in liquid is frozen and does not contain any
inhomogeneities. The hydrodynamic contribution entering in 7, completely coincides with the
parabolic growth problem because this contribution plays a key role only in the limit of slow
velocity V when the hyperbolic mass transfer does not occur and the crystal growth proceeds in
accordance with the parabolic heat and mass transfers.
