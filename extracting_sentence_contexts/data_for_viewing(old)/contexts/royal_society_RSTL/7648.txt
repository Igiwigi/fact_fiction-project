35. The * spiral lamina * or © primary skeleton,” as it may be regarded, is composed of
almost impalpable calcareous grains closely cemented. It is imperforate, and not more
than from 555 to x37 of an inch in thickness. From this extreme tenuity it necessarily
depends for support upon accessory structures. *

36. The space enclosed by its first revolution—constituting the central axis (Plate
LXXX. fig. 2, c@)—is occupied by a mass of shell-substance somewhat resembling in
general features a piece of fine sponge, but not quite uniform in its structure. Quite in
the centre it assumes the form of a network of irregular anastomosing tubes, with the in-
terspaces filled in with shell-substance to a greater or less extent ; but nearer the primary
lamina, the irregularly disposed growths resolve themselves into a more definite series,
and take a uniform direction. 'The outer portion becomes in fact the commencement
of a system of parallel columnar or tubular processes springing from the inner surface
of the spiral lamina, and having their free ends directed inwards (Plate LXXIX. fig. 1, a,
and fig. 2, a). This system of parallel tubuli may under favourable cireumstances be
traced throughout the course of the spiral lamina, except when interrupted by the occur-
rence of septa ; and it forms, as well shown in the figures just referred to, a sort of lining
to its inner surface. The two structures are in such close juxtaposition that they appear
continuous ; and their physiological distinctness is only noticed in exceptional places,
when a minute portion of the sarcode appears to have become entangled between them,
leaving for a short distance the primary lamina free from the accessory skeleton (Plate
LXXIX. fig. 2, 6, and Plate LXXX. fig. 3, b). 'Thenature and extent of the labyrinthic
portion of the layers may be best understood from a longitudinal section taken on a line
very near the periphery, as shown in Plate LXXIX. fig. 1; for whilst a central section
