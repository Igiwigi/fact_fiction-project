148 MR. BRODIE ON CEROTIC ACID.

lowing pages, I offer to the Royal Society are correct, their true chemical relations
and constitution have been undiscovered.

It would be useless, and it is by no means my intention, to comment upon all the
ideas which other chemists have entertained upon this matter. There is however
one theory, which has been advanced by certain chemists in France, of which it
would be unbecoming in me to take no notice, both because it has a certain apparent
amount of fact to support it, and because the originators of it, and others also, believe
that they have finally settled the question of the true place which wax should hold
in our classification of chemical substances*. M. Lewy has stated that cerin, that
portion of the wax which is the more solu√æle in alcohol, is converted by oxidation by
means of lime and potash into stearic acid. The method he pursned was that used
by Dumas with such success for the conversion of alcohol into acetic acid; of
potatoe oil into valerianic acid ; and for other similar transformations. He has ex-
plained the reaction by giving to the cerin the formula C;, Hz, O,. On this hypothesis,
the cerin, by conversion into stearic acid, loses three equivalents of hydrogen and
takes up three equivalents of oxygen into its constitution, the reaction being ex-
pressed by the equation

Ci, H; O;+3HO=C,, H;, O;+H,= [ Se ] ,
