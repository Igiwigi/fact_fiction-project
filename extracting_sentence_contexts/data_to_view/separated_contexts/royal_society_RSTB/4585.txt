In this connection it is appropriate to refer to the existence of
the “biporous ambulacrals” around the Spatangid peristome. The principle
enunciated above implies that it is possible that these might originally have been
two plates, although it would be premature to attempt any conclusion on the subject
here. There is another possible method of derivation of the Echinoid triad which, though
morphologically simple, seems less in accord with observed facts than the one
indicated above. It is at least probable that the Diademoid triad was developed by
the addition of an intervening simple plate to a Saleniid type of dyad. In such a
primitive compound, the apicad member of the pair is usually the smaller, and may
occasionally be reduced.
