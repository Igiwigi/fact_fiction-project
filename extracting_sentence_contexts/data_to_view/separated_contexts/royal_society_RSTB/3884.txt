The teeth
8 are uncusped, and the wearing shows that there must have been some slight antero-
§ posterior movement of the lower jaw, but whether this was effected by a movement
& between the dentary and the posterior bones of the jaw, or between the articular and
g the quadrate, or by a loose attachment of the quadrate, is at present unknown. A
5 remarkable mammal-like character is the passing of the lower canine outside the edge
Bo of the maxillary bone. Ina number of characters such as the development of the
septomaxillary, the shape of the nasals, the fact of the frontals entering the orbital
= margins, the apparent absence of a pineal foramen and the structure of the teeth, an
3 affinity with Bauria is suggested. On the other hand Sesamodon differs markedly
EB from Bauria in the shape of the lower jaw, in the structure of the squamosal, in the
2 mode of articulation of the lower jaw, in having a feebly developed vomer, and in the
2 general structure of the back of the skull. Sesamodon also differs markedly from the
. typical Cynodonts of the Cynognathus group in a number of characters and in most
= of these it agrees with the mammalian condition.

é Unfortunately nothing is known of the postcranial skeleton of Sesamodon or
E Melinodon.

& Probably two other distinct families of Cynodonts are represented by the two
3 supposed Cynodonts from the lower Jurassic Red Beds.
