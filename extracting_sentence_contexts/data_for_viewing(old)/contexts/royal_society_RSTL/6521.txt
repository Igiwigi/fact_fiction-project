Stains that in the centre of an exhausted tube of some length only gaseous lines are seen.
He was embarrassed in several instances by the decomposition or absorption of the
Sgaseous media ; and there must always be some doubt as to the precise nature of these
amedia, as the tubes are hermetically sealed. On the other hand, KiRonnopry seems
Sto attach most importance to the metallic lines, whose influence he has exhibited to a
owonderful extent by a spectrum-apparatus probably unrivalled. All hold the doctrine
—of an essential connexion between the character” of the spectral lines and the chemical
Snature of the substances which are present in the track of the discharge ; and the last,
in conjunction with BUxSEN, has based on this principle the new system of spectral
Sanalysis, which is rapidly becoming popular, and has applied it to explain the dark
lines of the solar spectrum in a way which, if not absolutely certain, is singularly elegant.
Yet it is impossible to overlook the fact that, in all this, much is assumed, not proved.
Has it been established that these lines depend s0 absolutely on chemical character that,
none of them can be common to two or more different bodies? Has it been ascertained
that, while the chemical nature of the bodies present remains unchanged, the lines never
vary if the circumstances of mass, density, &c. are changed? And what evidence have
we that spectra are superposed, 80 that we obserye the full sum of the spectra which the
