Figure 3. Pictorial representation of Wheeler's delayed-choice experiment in space. A photon wave packet enters the first
beam splitter (BS) of an interferometer, which extends along thousands of kilometres in space. The interferometer can be
randomly arranged according to two configurations that correspond to the presence or the absence of the second BS (in/out
BS) located on the Earth. Following Wheeler's idea, the configuration choice is performed when the photon has already entered
the interferometer. In the actual implementation of Vedovato et al. [21], the interferometer begins and terminates at the MLRO,
extending up to the target satellite, and the measurement choice performed on the ground is space-like separated from the
photon reflection at the satellite.

In his idea, depicted in figure 3, a photon enters an interferometer that can be arranged
according to two alternative configurations. If the interferometer is closed, one can observe
an interference pattern, reflecting the fact that the photon travelled both routes at the same
time, as a classical wave. If the interferometer is left open, then the two detectors show a
flat probability distribution in the recorded clicks, reflecting the fact that the photon travelled
along only one arm of the interferometer, as a classical particle. The mutual exclusivity of
the two experimental arrangements needed for observing the two complementary behaviours
allows one to consider the photon to be either a wave or a particle at any moment of the
experiment. To prevent any causal link between the configuration choice and the photon’s
behaviour, Wheeler proposed to delay the final setting of the apparatus until after the
photon had already entered the interferometer, preventing it from knowing beforehand how
to behave.

In 2017, we reported in the work by Vedovato et al. [21] the implementation of Wheeler’s
idea along a satellite-ground interferometer that extends for thousands of kilometres in space.
