appreciable error could arise from this cause. As a matter of curiosity 1 found it was

308 MR. J. 0. Mo CONNEL ON AN EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATION

The above observations relate to values of Ã¾ ranging from 4* to 38%, Por larger
values I required a plate cut parallel to the axis. So I bad two new faces cut, on
Plate 2, at right angles to the former ones and therefore nearly parallel to the axis,
forming in fact a new plate, which I will call Plate 3. The two new faces were good
planes and made an angle of about 24" with one another, and not more than 9' with
the axis.

In the observations on Plate 3, it was necezary to 8et all four faces nearly parallel
to the axis of rotation of the spectrometer table 80 as to secure that the axis should
lie in the plane of measurement. The bands were shadowy and indistine compared
with those seen in Plate 2. This was only to be expected, for we really have two
distinct sets of bands due to the two 8odium lines, For a given value of $ the
retardation is very nearly the same for either line, but if it amounts to 300 wave-lengths
for D, it will be about 300'3 wave-lengths for D,z. Thus the 300th band for D, will
divide the distance between the 300th and 301st bands for I, in the ratio of 3 to 7, now
in the bands observed the retardation ranged from 253 wave-lengths to 312. So it was
