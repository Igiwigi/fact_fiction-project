3. Can one experience a relation without

experiencing the relata?

We set up to test the no-Overflow interpretation of the [30]
results, according to which one can experience a relation
(such as CD) without discriminating and experiencing its
underlying relata, in a simplified experimental context.
Note that in [30] the task design includes WM overload (lim-
iting the ability to encode individual elements), and therefore
the fact that people cannot report the individual items is
expected and stands in contrast to remarkable ability to
make CD discriminations. This contrast could mean that the
experience of the summary statistic (relation) and of the
elements (relata) dissociate, as per the non-Overflow
interpretation, or that both the relation and the relata are
experienced (albeit one of them transiently), as per the Over-
flow interpretation. There are two ways in which one can
probe these issues further. One is to replace the WM load
with an attentional one, using a divided attention task
[24,28]. Here the rationale is to probe if, in ‘near absence of
visual attention’ but without the WM load that blocks encod-
ing into WM, observers can still report a relation without
