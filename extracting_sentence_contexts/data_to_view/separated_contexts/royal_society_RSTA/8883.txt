There is not wanting independent
evidence that this is what actually happens. It is known that the halo can be
obliterated by heating the mica. This fact led the earlier observers into the curious
notion that the halo was an “ organic” effect. Presumably the idea was that it was
a coloration due to carbon which became oxidised upon heat being applied. If the
halo was due to the formation of a stable oxide of iron it seems certain that even a
red heat would not affect it.
