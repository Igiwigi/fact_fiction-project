different density changes. Curve A, “ vapour” to critical density ; B, critical density to
“liquid”; C, “liquid” to critical density ; D, critical density to “ vapour”.

From the isobar curves (fig. 3) it is seen that the required temperature changes
will differ depending on the isobar in question, the smallest change required being for
the isobar at the lowest pressure. In all cases the density change was 0-0570 g./c.c.
For curve A the initial and final densities were 0- 1580 g./c.c. and 0-2150 g./c.c.
respectively. This involved a change on the isobar from the “ vapour”
region to the point of inflexion. It is apparent that as the pressure decreases the
time to half-value increases rapidly. At a pressure of 49-80 atmospheres the time
to half-value was not reached in seven hours. As a matter of fact, for most points
on the curve the equilibrium values could not be obtained. For instance, on the
50-54 atmosphere isobar the time to half-value of 45 minutes was taken as the time
when the density had reached the half-way value to 0-2150 g./c.c. as originally

measured on the isobar by decreasing the temperature. Actually the equilibrium
value had not been reached in four hours, and it is estimated that at the 50-10
atmosphere isobar, which is above the critical temperature and pressure, the equili-
brium would not be reached in 12 hours if at all, as indicated by the latter part
of the time-density.
