But at the boundary of the adiabatic layer the velocity of agitation vanishes, and
collisions become infinitely rare. These two propositions are mutually destructive of
one another, and it is impossible to push the conception of convective equilibrium to
its logical conclusion. There must, in fact, be some degree of rarity of density, and of
collisions, at which the statistical treatment of the medium breaks down. T have sought to obtain some representation of the state of things by supposing
that collisions never occur beyond a certain distance from the centre of the swarm. Then, from every point of the surface of the sphere, which limits the regions of
collisions, a fountain of meteorites is shot out, in all azimuths and inclinations to the
vertical, and with velocities grouped about a mean according to the law of error.
