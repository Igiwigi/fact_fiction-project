sought and obtained the permission of the Royal Society to withdraw this subsection
RE The facts of which it treats form in themselves a connected body
distinct from all the other facts which are detailed in the rest of this communication ;
80 that, while their omission from the present paper does not entail any furthur modi-
fication of the latter, they will admit of being introduced en masse in my next paper. When, therefore, I shall have completed the further experiments which in this con-
nexion I have devised, I shall hope to communicate to the Royal Society, in a single
connected geries, all the facts and inferences which bear upon this subject.”

Although I have not even yet completed all the experiments which it is desirable
to make with reference to this subject, I have this year s0 far added to their number
that I feel the research is now sufficiently ripe for publication. As already stated, an
epitome of the main facts regarding artificial rhythm has previously appeared in the
*Proceedings of the Royal Society '; but of course it will now be necessary to give a
more detailed account of these facts, no less than of those which I have more recently
observed.
