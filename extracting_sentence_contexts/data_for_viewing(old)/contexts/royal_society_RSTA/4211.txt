and is in conflict with rules (1)-(3) will be at odds with rational reasoning and consistency, as DNS
embodied by the desiderata (i)—(iii). It should be mentioned here that it is not allowed to define a if
plausibility for a proposition conditional on the conjunction of mutually exclusive propositions: 2B
reasoning on the basis of two or more contradictory premises is out of the scope of LI. .

The applications of LI which we review in the present paper describe phenomena in a manner
which is independent of individual subjective judgment. Therefore, to differentiate between the
‘objective’ and ‘subjective’ mode of application of LI, we will refer to the plausibility as ‘inference-
probability’ or ‘i-prob’ for short. A more extensive discussion and arguments for distinguishing
between plausibility, inference probability and Kolmogorov probability can be found in [22]. For
the purpose of the present review, it is sufficient if the reader does not think of the i-prob as a
frequency or probability in the traditional mathematical sense but merely as a numerical measure
for the fact that proposition A is true, given that proposition B is true.

In real experiments, there is always uncertainty about some factors which may or may
not influence the outcome of the measurements: it is presumptuous to assume that we know
‘everything’ about these factors. In particular, if experiment shows that (a) there is uncertainty
about each individual event and (b) the conditions under which the experiment is carried out are
also subject to uncertainties, then the data collected in such an experiment cannot be described
by the traditional theories of classical physics, the reason being that the theoretical description of
‘classical physics’ assumes that there is absolute certainty about the outcome of each individual
experiment on each individual object. By contrast, the LI approach is well suited to deal with
uncertainties but, as will be explicitly shown later, to render the resulting description free of
individual subjective judgement, it is necessary to assume that (c) the frequencies with which
events are observed are reproducible and robust (to be discussed later) against small changes
