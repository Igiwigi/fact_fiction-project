Let me at this point mention a question which I used to puzzle about. That question is, ‘Should
this field be precision measurement or precision measurements—with or without the s?’ The
answer I believe is precision measurement without the s because were it precision measurements
you would be given the idea that there is a precision measurement here, another precision
measurement over there, and another one somewhere else, and they are all unrelated. If this
were in fact true, then it would bode poorly for any substantial progress in this field because
there would be absolutely no transfer-learning which can be applied to a new measurement from
what one has learned from having done other precision measurements. On the other hand, if it
is precision measurement, where what one learns from one experiment can also be applied to
other ‘different yet similar’ experiments, then there will be a transfer-of-learning benefit which
guides one’s thinking on how to proceed and what to worry about in any newly undertaken
experiment. Since I believe that I have learned much which is broadly applicable from each
of many such experiments that I have been involved in, I see precision measurement science
