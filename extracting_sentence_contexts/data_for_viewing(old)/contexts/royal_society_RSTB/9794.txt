which they designated the Cambrian period (for reviews,
see [4,5]). One might have naively imagined that these oldest
earliest fossiliferous layers would contain the remains that
were quite simple in form or clearly ancestral to later groups
of animals. But that was not the case. The earliest rocks that
bore any recognizable animal fossils contained representatives
of several different phyla, including arthropods, molluscs, bra-
chiopods and echinodermsâ€”all of which were rather complex
and specialized.

Although what nineteenth century geologists referred to as
the Cambrian era has since undergone considerable revision,
one important fact has not changed: rocks older than the
Cambrian contain very few bilaterian fossils [6,7]. Darwin was
famously aware of this seemingly sudden origin of diverse ani-
mals in the fossil record and considered it among the most
serious objections to his theory of natural selection [8]. He pro-
posed that imperfections of the fossil record were responsible
for the abrupt appearance of animal fossils, and that an extended
interval of animal evolution remained to be discovered.

The next key event in understanding the origin of metazo-
ans was the discovery of the soft-bodied fauna of the Burgess
Shale by Charles Walcott in 1909, a story made famous
by Stephen Jay Gould in his book Wonderful life [9]. The
