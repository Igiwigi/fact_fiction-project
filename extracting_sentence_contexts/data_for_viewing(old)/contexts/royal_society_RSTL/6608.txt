and therefore the moment of mz det (D(Q), R) about the axis of » equals

mA(YPs—=@P,)/— (azp.—2pz)s} =m(2+})p,—My3P,—MESP..
Therefore, if we take the sum of these for all the particles and remember that the
axes are principal axes, that sum will equal p,Em(z*+z*) Now we have already

proved that p,, the component parallel to the axis of & of D(2), =. Hence we see
that the 8um of the moments about Or of the moving forces of which m det (D(Q), R)

is the type is A m_ and that this follows from the properties of principal axes, and from

: . dos;
the fact that the component of D,(Q) parallel to the axis of & is __

In the second place, we have already seen in section 30 of Chapter II. that the
moment about the axis of x of det (Q, V) equals —r#v, cos @, v, being the component of
V, and 9 the angle between the radius vector and V.

But —r#v, cos © equals evidently —o,(a7,+y7,+27.), and »v, equals zx,—yz., If
then we observe that E(mav,)=0, E(myv,)=— E(mg*)z,, E(mzv,)=E(mz*)z,, it follows
easily from the above that the sum of the moments about Or of the moving forces, of
which m det (Q, V) is the type, equals Z(m2?) =,,—Z(mg*) n.#,=(C—B)z,v, This
last proposition may be also proved in a different manner, which will show its connexion
with the proof first given of EuLun's equations.
