It has been found in other investigations,
to be published later, that the most important non-periodic single factor in deter-
mining the catch is the minimum temperature of the night. The last division in
Table III shows the mean minimum temperatures for the same periods dealt with
in the same manner as used for the summation of the Noctuidae. From this emerges
the curious fact that in 1933 all of the six weeks of “‘ no moon” were cooler than
the corresponding week of “ full moon” ; while in 1934 the reverse occurred and
five successive “no moon” weeks were warmer than the corresponding “ full
moon” weeks. In 1935 the temperatures were more regularly distributed. The two sets of figures taken in conjunction show that in 1933 the differences
in catch in favour of “‘ no moon” were obtained in spite of an adverse temperature
effect which alone would have tended to produce a preponderance in the opposite
direction.
