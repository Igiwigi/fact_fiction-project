That the magnetism destroyed by the remoyal of a portion


the particles of magnetic bodies, &c. 91

of any mass should be more than a proportional part of the
whole, does not appear extraordinary ; but that the removal
of a portion, in which, separately, the magnetism developed
is represented by 26, should cause a diminution represented
by 687 in the magnetism developed in the mass, or more than
24 times its separate effect; and that the separation should
be nearly equivalent to the removal, are striking, and, I think,
important facts in the investigation of the laws according to
which magnetism is communicated to, and distributed in re-
volving bodies. These results are in perfect accordance with
those which I have deduced from the experiments with the
disc I.

It follows then from these experiments, that, in the de-
velopement of induced magnetism by rotation, every portion
of a mass contributes towards the intensity of the magnetism
developed, and that in a much greater ratio than would, by
direct induction, be due to that portion according to its
distance from the magnet ; s0 that there appears to be, as it
were, an accumulation of magnetism arising from the mutual
