"There was a considerably s8maller average percentage of total Graminee with the
smaller than with the larger amount of nitrate (and mineral manures). There was
a much larger, and a greatly increasing, percentage of leguninous herbage, and a
considerably higher average, but a gradually diminishing, proportion of total Mis-
cellane. The herbage was, in fact, less exclusively gramineous, and, upon the whole,
considerably more mixed, with the smaller amount of nitrate, and the consequent less
luxuriance of the freer-growing species. Among the grasses, neither Poa trivialts nor Bromus mollis, which were 80 prominent
on plot 14, was 80 in any degree on plot 16. Poa trivialis, however, maintained its
position very much better than Bromus molltis, which yielded only a fraction of 1 per
cent.
