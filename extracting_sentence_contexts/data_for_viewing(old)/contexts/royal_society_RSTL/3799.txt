90. That the nucleus of the vegetable cell, instead of being © absorbed as nseless,”
after the formation of the cell-membrane, performs a part not less important than
that which I have described as appertaining to it in animals, there can be no kind of
doubt. TI happen to have incidentally met with the germinal granules of the mush-
room (fig. 27), and of the mould of cheese (fig. 26) ; and have figured them, as pre-
senting evidence of this kind. Too much importance, it appears to me, has been
attached, of late, to the membrane of the cell ; while the source of the contents of the
cell, and apparently of all * secondary deposits,” that is, the nucleus, has been
overlooked,

91. It is stated by Vateniy that in plants, all © secondary deposits” take place in
Spiral lines. I have already remarked, that in animals, spirals have heretofore ap-
peared almost wanting. Should the facts recorded in this memoir, however, be esta-
blished by the researches of other investigators, the question in future may perhaps
be, where is the © secondary deposit” in animal structure, which is not connected
with the spiral form? But more than this: the spiral in animals, as we have seen, is
in strictness not a * secondary” formation ; it is the most primary of all. And the
question now, is whether it is not precisely s0 in plants.
