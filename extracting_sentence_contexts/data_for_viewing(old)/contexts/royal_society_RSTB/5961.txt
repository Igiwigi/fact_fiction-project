strains while only about 2 mm. apart (the width of the glass) could grow independently
of each other’s mycelium and staling products and, in fact, of all but the volatile
products to which both were equally exposed. As a control DH» was grown alone in
an inner dish surrounded by uninoculated medium. The radius of each DH, culture
was measured periodically and the values obtained are given in Table XVIII.
