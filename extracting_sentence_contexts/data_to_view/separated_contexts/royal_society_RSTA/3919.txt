If aggregates sink to the seabed without
exchanging material with the small size classes, to which most of the dissolved Th is initially
adsorbed, then these aggregates would have a deficit of %°Th compared with the smaller
particles. Such a deficit would cause us to overestimate the actual dust flux when applying the
230Th-normalization method to the more than 51m size fraction because the concentration of
230Th appears in the denominator of the flux calculation (equation (3.7)). The 2°Th-normalized dust flux derived from the more than 51 um size fraction is, in fact,
systematically greater than the flux derived using the 0.8-51 um size fraction of the same sample
(figure 6b). This is consistent with some portion of the population of large aggregates settling
through the water column without completely exchanging material with the smaller particle size
classes. However, the difference is only 30-40% on average (figure 6b), much less than the factor
of 3-6 difference expected if the bulk average particle settling velocity were as high as estimated
by Ohnemus & Lam [68].
