assumptions on the the behaviour of investors, the condition p > A is always satisfied. Note that
the expression of a(t) in (1.9) shows that for c < 1, the free boundary a(t) cannot be non-increasing
in time when p <4. Therefore, the argument proving that a(t) is non-increasing in time when
p = Ais optimal. Similarly, it is possible to see from (1.9) that the monotonicity results in (1.8) does
not hold for p <a andc <1.

(b) Comments on an alternative approach

As we have seen, the non-local problem we study here, (1.2), is closely related to a somewhat
classical local obstacle problem (1.6). This problem is not straightforward either. Indeed, it is set on
the whole real line, and it is seen that the free boundary starts from infinity at t= 0. Nevertheless,
it is tempting to approach the non-local u-problem by first solving the local w-problem (1.6). As a
matter of fact, to derive further qualitative properties, we study this w-problem in §7. However,
the w-problem does not yield the solution of the u-problem that is of interest in a straightforward
fashion. By solving the w-problem, we, indeed, obtain the free boundary, but we then need to
show that it is of the form {x = a(t)} = d{w > y}. We further need to recover u from w, and this does
not follow immediately from the local obstacle problem. Indeed, we have to solve the equation
for u in the domain {x < a(t)} with a(t) > 0, and this equation reads

Lu=0 on {(x,t) € R x (0,+00), x < a(t},
u(a(t), t) = u(—a(t), t) + w(a(t),t) for t € (0, +00) (1.10)
and u(x,0)=0 forxeR

Equation (1.10) is also non-local because of the boundary condition. One way to solve the u-
problem then is to rewrite problem (1.10) with the coordinates y =x — a(t). For this, we need to
