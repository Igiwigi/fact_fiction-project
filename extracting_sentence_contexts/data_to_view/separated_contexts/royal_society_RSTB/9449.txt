Nevertheless, some authors have imagined
such scenarios, often boasting to be the first to have done so. Our purpose in this section is to recount, without initial critical
comment, several such claims.

(a) Reanney’s genome reduction scenario (1974)

A notably early EF proposal would be Reanney’s [22]. Based on
‘the fact that many stages of evolution appear to have been
accompanied by physical loss of superfluous DNA’, he ‘postu-
lated that the genomes of prokaryotes—where almost every
gene is represented by one copy only—represent the results of
this process carried to its extreme’. Moreover, he mused, ‘certain
features of very early evolution which have been eliminated
from prokaryotes may survive in eukaryotes’ [22].

(b) Woese and Fox’s progenote (1977-1982)

For Carl Woese, a motivating belief was that major structur-
al and functional differences between the translational


machineries of Bacteria, Archaea and eukaryotes reflect father). The notion of some sort of RNA-world-generated El

different solutions to problems of translational accuracy and RNA-genomed ancestor, converting to DNA independently

efficiency as yet only partially solved in their common ances- at the base of one or more of the three domains, remained a
tor.
