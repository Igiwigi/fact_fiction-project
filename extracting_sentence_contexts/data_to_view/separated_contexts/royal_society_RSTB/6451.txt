There is no trace of longitudinal
muscles in the larva of WV. fasciatus, but Harms (1912, p. 203) describes them as
poorly developed in the larva of C. canis. While examining different series of sections, I was struck by a fact which clearly
shows that the radial striations in the bigger cells act as muscle fibres and control
the dilatation of the lumen of the rectal sac. As shown in fig. 30, the lumen is
reduced and is star-shaped and the lateral insinkings are very deep.
