Schoute (1913, pp. 297, 310) considered that leaf asymmetry was secondary and occurred
when the space available for a primordium was itself asymmetric provided that the new
primordium made contact with the underlying leaves. The new primordium then extended
asymmetrically to fill the unequal gaps on each side of its centre. This may, indeed, perhaps
account for the fact that in Rhoeo the anodic half is usually slightly the thicker radially,
since it lies above the meeting-point of the edges of the previous leaf, where there is the
most space available in a radial direction; but it cannot account for the greater length of
the kathodic half in normal plants. The following results of the present experiments need
also to be considered. When the centre of P, was removed, the anodic half of J, increased
in length and in three experiments exceeded the kathodic, and this increase varied directly
with the divergence angle J,-/,, which also increased.
