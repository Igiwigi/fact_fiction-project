Figure 4. (a) p(z = 0) versus ¢. The dashed line indicates the scaling ¢* predicted theoretically. (b) Inverse of mean reversal
time as a function of e. The scaling at small ¢ is proportional to p(0). (Online version in colour.)

A further characteristic of the system is the average waiting time (t,) between two reversals,

shown in figure 4b for different ¢. It is found that the inverse of (f,) scales as e(N-5)/2 at small : =
g, just as p(0). This translates the aforementioned fact that the width of the bottleneck controls :g
the reversals for small ¢. It is interesting to note that in the Kramers problem [66], which [3
consists of the escape of a Brownian particle from a potential well, a similar relation is found a)
between the mean first-escape time and the probability to be at the edge of the well. There, :8
the constant of proportionality can be computed in terms of the curvature of the potential. In :s
the TEE, by contrast, there is no underlying potential which generates the dynamics. Therefore, 1s

a priori, the constant of proportionality cannot be derived in the same way as for the Kramers
problem. The chaotic motion of the higher-dimensional truncated-Euler dynamics may possibly
be modelled by noise. Alternatively, instanton theory, which has already proven to be a powerful
tool for studying transitions in multistable hydrodynamic systems [67,68], provides a promising
approach to studying the reversal statistics here.
