(a) M-theoretic cosmology

It was a surprise to many that the quantum consistency of superstrings eventually required the
existence of further (than strings) low-dimensional objects, the p-branes, with p taking ‘small
integer values’. Once one allows for strings (that is p= 1 objects) into the theory, however, it is
completely natural to expect that other such objects play an important role and consider these
other possibilities. Branes are ubiquitous and largely unexplored, and given the various dualities
between the original five string theories and 11-dimensional supergravity, it is only natural to
explore them in this generalized context of interconnected theories coined M-theory. In fact, in
the string or brane gas scenario of Brandenberger et al. in 2000 [94], the universe is supposed
to be a ‘hot soup’ of branes of all p dimensions, topologies and spatial orientations, and all
internal dimensions are assumed compact, in an attempt to explain why only three dimensions
are surviving. In the simplest models of this kind, branes of larger dimensionality have higher
energies and annihilate first, leaving only strings. Brane cosmology is a very rich subject, and
some aspects of it are treated in §3b.

A most important aspect of M-theory cosmology is revealed in the study of chaotic Mixmaster
behaviour in these frameworks. Initial results [95] pointed to the disappearance of the BKL chaotic
oscillations on approach to the string cosmological singularity in homogeneous Mixmaster models,
due to the combined effect of both the dilaton and the axion fields. A more elaborate treatment
of this problem brings us into the realm of the general effects of p-form fields often coming from
