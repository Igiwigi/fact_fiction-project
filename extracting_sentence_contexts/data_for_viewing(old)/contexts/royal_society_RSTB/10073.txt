the fact that acute events and chronic, gradual changes in the
environment also cause wildlife emergencies. Such emergen-
cies include disease outbreaks. Models and systems that
monitor, forecast and project environmental conditions have
thus far rarely been used to develop surveillance tools for
wildlife diseases [1]. However, significant investments in
forecasting models have created the capability to develop
such surveillance tools and climate change now provides
greater impetus for their use [2]. This is especially the case
in the marine environment where the incidence of disease
has been on the rise [3-5] and some diseases, like those of
corals, are expected to increase with warming [1]. Further,
many marine host—pathogen systems are temperature sensi-
