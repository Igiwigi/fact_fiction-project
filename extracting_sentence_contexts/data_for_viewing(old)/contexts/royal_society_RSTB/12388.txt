Craft et al. imaged tubulin being transported by IFT in Chlamy-
domonas flagella, and reported ‘occupancy’ as the fraction of
IFT trains that had an associated tubulin signal. In order to
think about such results, we recall the distinction between
IFT trains and IFT particles discussed in the Introduction.

P ‘IFT particle’ refers to the individual protein complexes
L= 24 (D/A) (2.2) made up of IFT proteins, while ‘IFT train’ refers to the linear
array of particles that move as a group within the flagellum.
Because tubulin occupancy has been determined as a function
of IFT trains, while tubulin binding is a function of individual
IFT particles, it is critical to take into account the fact that the
number of particles per train is a function of length. Figure 4a
diagrams the results of our prior experiments [18] in which
Lou (2+ (D/Awt)) we showed, both by quantitative TIRF microscopy and by

where L is the length, P is the total size of the flagellar precur-
sor pool (tubulin) expressed in length equivalents, D is the
rate of flagellar disassembly and A is the injection coefficient.
Solving for L, we find

We can then write the expected ratio of flagellar lengths in
a mutant (Ly) compared to the flagellar length in wild-type
cells (Ly,), given that the injection coefficients for the two
