meeting the limitations of known transfer trajectories from Earth to either of the ice giants, within
the anticipated budget limitations. Finding the most advantageous transfer trajectories is also a
challenge. There could be better trajectories that simply have not been found yet.

Fortunately, most of the technologies that enable a large directed ice giant mission with known
transfer trajectories are currently available, though technology improvements can significantly
enhance a mission's science return. The one technology area needing development to enable such
a mission is generating sufficient electric power.

2. Technologies for transfer from Earth to an ice giant

To conduct extended science operations within an ice giant system, a spacecraft must first make
the long journey from Earth to the ice giant. The fact that only one spacecraft, Voyager 2 [1], has
made this journey speaks to its difficulty. Extended operations also require that the spacecraft
remain in the planet's vicinity, so insertion into orbit is required. Various hardware considerations,
such as usable lifetimes of critical components and subsystems, and performance of propulsion
systems required for orbit insertion, limit the acceptable transfer trajectories. There are multiple
trades involved in assessing trajectories. For example, a specific trajectory might provide a short-
duration transfer, but its arrival Vo, the spacecraft’s velocity of approach to the destination
before the spacecraft ‘feels’ the destination’s gravity, is so high that it requires an orbit insertion
manoeuver exceeding the practical performance capability of available propulsion systems.

The 2016 NASA study of ice giant mission concepts [2] included an extensive analysis of
transfer trajectory options for launch within the active period of the next US Planetary Science
Decadal Survey (PSDS), 2023-2032, and a few years beyond. It serves as an excellent general
