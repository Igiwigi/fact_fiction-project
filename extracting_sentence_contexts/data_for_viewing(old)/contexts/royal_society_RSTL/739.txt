222 Mr. Hartcnertr on an artificial tanning Substance,

5. That of the coal afforded it in great abundance.

Hence it appears, that these different modifications of tux=
pentine. yielded the tanning snbstance only in proportion to
the quantity of their original earbon, which, by oxidizement,
had been progressively converted into coal.*

Other substances, when reduced into coal in the humid way,
were in like manner formed into the tanning substance by nitric
acid. In fact I found this to be the constant result, and amongst
the many substances which were examined, I shall mention
various kinds of wood, copal, amber, and wax, all of which,
when reduced to coal by sulphuric acid, yielded similar pro-
ducts, by subsequent treatment with nitric acid.

But this substance may likewise be artificially produced
without the help of nitric acid, although in a less proportion,
as well as with some slight variations in its characteristic pro=
perties; for, as I have already observed, when any of the resins
or gum resins ( such as common resin, elemi, asa fcetida, &c. )
have been long digested with sulphuric acid 80. as to assume
the appearance and general characters of coal, if afterwards
