rise eastward from 14,820 feet on the Irawadi-Salween divide to 15,800 feet on the
Salween-Mekong divide, and 15,090 feet on the Lo-tue Shan, W. of Shih-ku. At 26° 7’
the Hpsimaw Bum, 13,300 feet, is lower than the 15,200 feet height E. of the Mekong.
Farther 8. the heights along the Kao-liang Shan, which forms the Shweli-Salween
divide, rise to 14,440 feet and are higher than any peaks on the same latitude to the
E. Although the summits do not descend to the W. the level of the rivers decreases
steadily westward, as remarked by Mr. Kinepon Warp (1923, p. 17). The Salween
is the lowest ; its level is 2,300 feet at the Salween Bridge, while the Mekong is crossed
by the same road at 4,400 feet, and farther E. the Yang-pi is crossed at 5,200 feet. In
Chinese Tibet, however, the Salween is the highest river of the three ; for, according
to TEICHMAN (1922, map), Di, on the Salween just 8. of 29° N., is at 10,500 feet, the
Mekong at 29° is at 7,907 feet, and the Yangtze must be much lower than the Salween
as Ba-tang, which stands higher than the Yangtze, is only at 9,000 feet. The fact that
farther 8. the floors of the western valleys are lower than those of the eastern valleys
is explicable by the greater corrosion by the western rivers owing to the numerous
factors that may be grouped as the accidents of denudation. There is no general west-
ward descent of the plateau surface (fig. 11).
