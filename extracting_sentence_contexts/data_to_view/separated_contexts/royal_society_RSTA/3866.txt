Such
regimes, however, can severely impede the dissemination of, and access to, scientific knowledge
and scientific advances on the part of the ordinary public. Limiting access to data or strictly
controlling knowledge dissemination on IP grounds risks according disproportionate weight to
one part of the right, thereby making the other part of it impossible or unduly burdensome to



exercise [35]. Granted that there might be several IP interests in data and their outcomes, the
question is whether all of these interests nonetheless generate the duty to protect them, when in
fact their protection will significantly impair our capacity to serve other interests or exercise other
rights. A less familiar aspect of the right to science is its reference to participation in the cultural life
of the community, including ‘sharing in’ scientific advances. One interpretation of this aspect
includes the right of everyone to have the opportunity to make a contribution to scientific
advances through participation in scientific research.
