It is also
icit on the spatial discrimination beacon task when trials are worth pointing out that in this rat study, D-AP5 impaired
started from close to the decoy beacon, and are also impaired acquisition of the spatial discrimination task despite the fact
during spatial reversal learning. We will now compare these that all trials were started from locations that were equidistant
data with earlier studies in rats using the NMDAR anta- between the two beacons, in contrast to the results with

gonist D-AP5. In fact, there is actually remarkably good GluN1°°°1 mice in this study (figure 1c). These different


outcomes could reflect the potentially more widespread effect
on NMDAR function following drug infusion, compared with
our regionally selective knockout mice. Alternatively, it could
reflect important species differences between rats and mice,
which may be related to the relative size of the animals and/
or the way that they behave on being placed in the water.
