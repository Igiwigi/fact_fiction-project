Ratio of displacements per atmosphere at 10 atmospheres to displacements per atmosphere at
higher. pressures.

10 atmospheres to the displacements at higher préssures, the data being taken from
Table I. The former are generally greater than the latter, and the mean value of
the ratio is 1°8. In Diagram 3 these ratios are plotted against wave-length ; if the
relationship between the pressure and displacement were precisely linear, the dots
would group themselves about the line marked 1:0, but it is very obvious that the
readings at 10 atmospheres are too large for this relationship to hold. The diagram
also shows the curious fact that the departure from a linear relation is much more
pronounced for lines of small wave-length. For large wave-lengths the ratio is nearly
equal to unity. This is partly, but not entirely, due to the fact that the lines of great
wave-length have not been examined over the full range of pressures. There is a
