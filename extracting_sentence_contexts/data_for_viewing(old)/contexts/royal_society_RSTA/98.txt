the appearance of unwanted massless scalar (spin-0) bosons [17,18]: ‘unwanted’ because no one : a
had seen any such bosons, and if they existed and had any reasonable strength of interaction they : g
ought to have been easy to see. 1s
The simplest model to illustrate this is the Goldstone model, which involves a complex scalar : ey
field $(t,r) with a self-interaction described by the potential function :

V=gX($*o - 3°), (6.1)

where A and 7 are positive constants. This is the sombrero potential (figure 5).

Like the base of a wine bottle discussed earlier, this potential has a maximum at ¢=0,
and minima around a circle. So the ground state, in this case the vacuum state |0), breaks the [=
symmetry. In fact, we have a degenerate vacuum state; we can have :

Suppose we choose one particular value, say a =0, thus making the expectation value real, Ye
and write ¢ as the vacuum expectation value plus real and imaginary parts: a
