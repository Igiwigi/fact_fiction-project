which—in conjunction with the boundary conditions imposed on w—would serve to
determine w if y were known. 4. In fact neither y nor w is known initially, so both must be deduced from (6)
and (10) combined with the imposed boundary conditions. These are von Karman’s
equations (§ 2). When the boundary values of u and v are specified, introduction of y is less convenient.
