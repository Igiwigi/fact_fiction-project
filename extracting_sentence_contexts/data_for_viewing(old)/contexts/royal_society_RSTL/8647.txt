The beam of light of an oxyhydrogen lamp was concentrated by means of a lens, and
the vessel was placed at such a distance from the focus that the cone of light just enclosed
the whole of the revolving mill. In this position the instrument showed the greatest
sensitiveness. The © light-mill ” revolved about 200 times in one minute.

The light was cut off at the beginning of the experiment by means of a screen, and
the position of rest of the glass vessel was read off by means of the dot of light on the
scale. The screen was then suddenly removed, and in eyery case a large deflection of
the glass vessel containing the light-mill was observed. The vessel was deflected in a
direction opposite to that in which the mill turned. When the velocity of the revolving
mill had become constant, the outer yessel gradually came back to its original position
of rest. This is a fact of great importance, and considerable care was taken to find out
with what degree of accuracy it could be establighed. Owing to disturbances produced
by various canses, the zero could never be determined within two or three divisions of
the scale. The position of rest of the vessel when the mill was turning with constant
velocity was always found to be within that distance from the original position of rest.

When the vessel containing the rotating © light-mill ” had come to rest, the screen
was suddenly replaced between the light and the mill, The mill now gradually came
to rest, and at the same time the vessel was driven away in the opposite direction to that
in which it moved on starting the experiment. The vessel, on stopping the light, was
turned in the same direction in which the light-mill revolyed. I sball give the readings
of three experiments taken out of a great many made at different times arid with different
intensity of light.
