Fand we may assume that no shifting which a line undergoes in its own direction can

5 (61.) Longitudinal Effect considered geometrically, —But though the shifting of a
& line in its own direction generates no surface, it produces alteration of position ; and
& hence it constitutes an important conception. The only difficulty, in considering the
= longitudinal effect geometrically, consists in this—How is it that all units of longi-
- tudinal translation are equivalent (se arts. 36, 37), while those of lateral transJation
Z are not, and on what principle can this difference be interpreted? The answer ap-
S pears to be this: that 4.8 denotes the effect of translating the unit B along the per-
X pendicular unit «; that this operation conveys the conception of a particular plane,
= and we must think of «.Þ, B.y as different operations because they are performed in
different planes. On the contrary, the translation of « along «, or « X «, conveys no
conception of a particular plane; in fact «Xx « and BX 3 may be regarded as performed
in the same plane. Thus, that which before made the difference does not exist in
this case.

but wx and u/Xu' may be always considered as lying in the
same plane; and consequently difference of magnitude only
remains to constitute a difference between u xv and uv X v'.
