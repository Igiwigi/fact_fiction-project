I think the object of these movements is probably that of stinging the offending body
by means of the urticating cells with which the extremity of the polypite is armed.
But, be the object what it may, the fact of these movements occurring is a highly
important one in connexion with our study of the distribution of neryes in Meduxe ;
and the first point to be made out with regard to these movements is clearly as to
whether or not they are of a truly reflex character. Accordingly I first tried cutting
off the margin and then irritating the muscular tissue of the bell; the movements in
question were performed exactly as before. These movements, therefore, supply an
additional instance of the rule laid down in my former paper, viz. : * Every Medusa,
when its centres of spontaneity have been removed, responds to a single stimulation by
once performing that action which it would have performed in response to that stimu-
lation had its centres of spontaneity still been intact.” Now the fact of this rule
holding good in this case opens up an interesting subject for our contemplation. It

will be observed that, so far as the moyements in question are themselves concerned,
they are undistinguishable from an ordinary reflex act—such, for instance, as we have
observed to occur in Sarsia. But we are accustomed to hear that for the occurrence of
a truly reflex act, the presence of ganglionic or central nerye-matter is requisite. Yet
in the case before us we have exceedingly precise action of an apparently reflex kind,
which is nevertheless quite independent of the only ganglia that can be shown to occur
in the organism. In view of this fact, therefore, I was led to think it probable that
