Oubic Scrolls, Article Nos. 25 to 85.

25. In the case of a cubic scroll there is necessarily a nodal* line; in fact for the
m-thic scroll there is a nodal curve which is of the order m—2 at least, and of the order
Em—1)(m—2) at most, and which for m=3 is therefore a right line. And moreover
we see at, once that eyery cubic surface having a nodal line is a scroll; in fact any plane
whatever through the nodal line meets the surface in this line counting as 2 lines, and
in a curve of the order 1, that is, a line; there are consequently on the s8urface an
infinity of lines, or the surface is a scroll. We have therefore to examine the cubic
surfaces which have a nodal line.

26. Let the equations of the nodal line be z=0, y=0; then the equation of the
surfkace is

Uz+Vu+Q=0,
where U, V, Q are functions of (x, y) of the orders 2, 2, 3 respectively.
