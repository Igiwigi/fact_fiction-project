None of these causes, however, appear adequate to account for the observed effect. Mere moisture has but little influence on argentine papers. The additional light re-
turned on the paper by continued reflection is much too small, and this explanation is
opposed by the observed fact, that the effect in question is imperceptible in a gloomy
day, however long the exposure be continued, and that it increases in degree as the
sun is stronger. This would certainly favour the idea that the cause is to be sought
in heat developed and retained by the glass; and this explanation may appear to be
supported by the fact, that the effect in question is not produced when the glass,
instead of being pressed into contact with the paper, is merely placed before it as a
screen, with a considerable interval between them. When a piece of nitrated paper,
for instance, was rolled round a cylindrical surface of moderate convexity, covered
with black velvet, and the glass gently laid in contact with it, the effect of sunshine
was exalted at the line of contact ; but on either side of that line, as the interval in-
creased, the influence of the glass diminished, and at less than half an inch distance
no difference could be perceived between the impressions under the glass and in free
air.
