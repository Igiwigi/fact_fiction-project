a functional symbol), the condition in order that the vicinal surface shall belong to this

family, or say that it shall coincide with the surface r+3râ€”7(z, y, 2)=0, is e=2 where

V=y/X+Y*+Z2, if X,Y, 7 are the first differential coefficients of 7(a, y, 2), that
is, of the parameter 7 considered as @ function of the coordinates; we have thus the

equation

((A), (B), (0), (F), (G), (H)X4., 4, 4.Y:F=0,

viz. the coefficients being functions of the first and second differential coefficients of 7,
and V being a function of the first differential coefficients of 7, this is in fact a relation
involving the first, second, and third differential coefficients of 7, or it is the partial
differential equation to be satisfied by the parameter 7 considered as a function of the
coordinates. After all reductions, this equation assumes the form previously mentioned.

On the Curvature of Surfaces. Article Nos. 1 to 21.

1. Curvature is a metrical theory having reference to the circle at infinity ; each point
in space may be regarded as the vertex of a cone passing through this circle, say the
circular cone; a line and plane through the vertex are at right angles to each other
when they are polar line and polar plane in regard to the cone; and 80 two lines or two
Planes are at right angles when they are harmonics in regard to the cone, that is, when
each line lies in the polar plane, or each plane passes through the polar line of the
