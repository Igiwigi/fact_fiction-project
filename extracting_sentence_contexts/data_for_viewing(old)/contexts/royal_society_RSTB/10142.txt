femur length reasonably well in D4509, A.L.827-1, KNM-ER
1481 and KNM-ER 1472 in the sense that all four fall
within the 95% prediction interval for the human sample;
however, all four plot below the regression and are therefore
slightly but consistently shorter than predicted. The femur of
ARA-VP-5/600 falls below the regression line at all estimates
of FHD and below the lower prediction limit for most of the
range of its estimated FHD. We suspect that a short estimated
femur length is driving the very high index in ARA-VP-5/
600, more so than a long estimated humerus length. The
femora of LB1 and A.L.288-1 both fall far below and outside
the prediction interval for their FHDs; in fact, LB1â€™s femur
length is better predicted by the humeral regression than
the femoral one. In other words, the femora of these two
very small-bodied hominins are especially short, and this
accounts for their extremely high humerofemoral indices
that approach that of Ardipithecus (contra [70,71]; also see
[72]). They are not little humans in their limb proportions.
It is also noteworthy that a putative male Au. afarensis
femur (A.L.827-1) plots within the modern human scatter,
but its conspecific female (A.L.288-1) does not; this could
imply an unusual degree of shape dimorphism and possibly
reflects sex-related differences in body size, body shape and
locomotor function. If Homo floresiensis were a scaled-down
