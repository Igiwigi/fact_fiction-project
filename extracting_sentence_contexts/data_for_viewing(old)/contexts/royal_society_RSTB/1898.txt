What the contents of the tubes in the completed tissue may be, is only a matter
of conjecture ; it seems certain that they are, so to speak, kept open by the processes
of the cells of the pulp which run outwards (fig. 15), but it does not seem likely that
they would, like true dentinal tubes, permanently retain plasm contents, and it
would be more likely that their contents are of the nature of SHaRpeyâ€™s fibres.

An interesting analogy with the conditions here described occurs in the develop-
ment of the scales of Lepidosteus, which also have an outer portion which has been by
some writers regarded as enamel, while others have denied its claim to be so called.

Nickerson (7) has pointed out as a remarkable fact that, although there is a
dermal papilla formed, the first calcification does not take place at its surface, but
a little way in, and that hence the epithelial cells which are largely developed over
it are separated by a layer of dermal tissue from the first plate of calcified material.
Though he does not describe any specialisation of the outer part of the dermal
papilla, it would seem probable that this state of things corresponds closely with that
which exists upon a Selachian tooth papilla.

Conclusions.

The outer hard layer which covers the teeth of Selachia and Ganoids does not
correspond exactly either with the dentine or with the enamel of Mammalia.
