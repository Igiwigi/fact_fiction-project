that in this chromosome the number 14 is an under-estimate and the real number of
coils is perhaps 16. It is also probable that individual differences exist owing to real
differences of length, since other chromosomes are suggestive of having 12. The
number 14 is thus only an approximate value for the average. It was determined for
its own sake before any of the subsequent calculations were made, and though any
element of uncertainty here is much to be regretted, even an approximate value is an
indispensable piece of information. Pending greater exactitude therefore, the number
14 will be provisionally used.

NOTES ON SOME PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF SPIRALS

Before proceeding from chromosome morphology to chromosome behaviour, it is
desirable to make clear some very simple geometrical facts relating to spiral objects
in general. This will explain to some extent the nature of the verbal distinctions
mentioned in the introduction. Other explanations will be found on pp. 187 and 202.
No great originality is claimed for these remarks nor are they exhaustive, but they
represent several different points of view all of which are in various ways applicable
to chromosomes.*

* The need for clarity about the properties of spirals has of course been felt by more than one writer
on spiral structure. Kuwada and his colleagues, in particular (1927, 1933, etc.), have dealt very lucidly
with a number of most pertinent geometrical considerations, some of which are included above, while
other writers, e.g. Koshy (1937), Darlington (1935), Upcott (1937), Nebel (1932), etc., have stressed
individual points. Clarity on single points is, however, insufficient to meet the problem, and failure
to appreciate its diversity is probably in part responsible for discordance in the literature.
