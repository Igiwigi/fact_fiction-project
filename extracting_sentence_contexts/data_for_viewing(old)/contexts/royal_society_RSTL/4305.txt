air at the height of four feet and protected from the effects of radiation, and that
placed on grass fully exposed to the sky ; the same relation was found to exist in
what azimuth soever the board was placed.

I then placed the pasteboard at an angle of 45? nearly with the horizon, and laid
the thermometers as before. In this sitnation their readings were found to be inter-
mediate as before, but that which was exposed to three-fourths of the sky, read most
nearly to that on the grass fully exposed to the sky, and the one which was exposed to
one-fourth part of the sky only, read most nearly to that in air. The amount of these
differences of readings was as nearly as could be determined exactly proportional to
the amount of the exposed sky.

Hence, as a general fact it may be considered, that whatever diminishes the view
of the sky as seen from an exposed body, causes its temperature to decrease less
than it would if the exposure to the sky be complete.

Various experiments were made to ascertain the effect of covering plants at night
by matting, or other thin substances; and it was always found that when the protect-
ing substances touched the plant, much heat was conducted away from it, and such
plant was at a lower temperature than when the substance was merely interposed
between it and the sky ; the thinnest substance thus interposed, at any distance from
the plant, was found to be effectual in preventing the loss of its heat by radiation.
It was found, however, that when a plant was thus itself protected, but yet was ex-
posed to any body which was exposed to the sky, more heat radiated from the former
to the latter, than from the exposed body to the plant, and thus it lost some heat.
