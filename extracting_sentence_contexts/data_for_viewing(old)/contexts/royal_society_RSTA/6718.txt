It is an immediate consequence of (3.1) that N(m;m) ts a non-null R-ideal. Further, from
(3.1) and (3.2),

(3.4) Ifmen (both members of H), then N(m;n) ¢R, nV(m;n) cm.
(3.5)f Ifm,, ...,.m,€ A,

N(m,;m,) N(ms;m,4) = N(m,;m,) V(m;m,).
A property of complementary modules is relevant at this point:

(3.6) Provided m belongs to H,m** is the intersection of all modules 1 which contain mt
and possess an n-term §-basis.

Any such n contains m**, because n** = n. The fact that N n<m** is seen by remarking
that m* (which also belongs to H) is the union of modules of the form §.. (w), with w linearly
independent over K. .

(3.7) For any m,ne H, N(m;n) = N(m;n**). Ifm =m**, M(im;n) = N(n*;m*).

The first assertion follows from (3.6); the second from the first and (3:3). ’

Local theory. For any prime ideal p of §, let N,(m;1) denote the norm of m&,, with
respect to mR, (over R,).

TueoreM 4. If m,ne H, and if n has a finite R-basis, N,(m; 1) = ®,.N(m;n). Under the
same conditions
