which passes down, and is inserted into the fundus of the mastav. Another more
slender band or ligament connects the projection with the foot of the fulcrum.

48. The tube of the buccal funnel (m) is very wide. The asophagus (p) is also
wide, and short. On the latter duct are Seated two globose clear salivary glands (n),
each of which encloses a spherical nucleated nucleus. These must not be confounded
with the pancreatic glands, which are much larger, and seated on the stomach, below
the entrance of the esophagus.

49. In Notommata aurita (figs. 16 to 21), while there is much resemblance to Bu-
chlanis, the structure is in some respects peculiar. The form of the mastar is prolate,
the longitudinal diameter exceeding the transverse,—a figure which is dependent on
the fact, that the fulcrum of the incus, and the manubria of the mallei, are greatly
produced in length, and are all extended nearly in the same direction ; viz. that of
the longitudinal axis of the body (se figs. 16 & 17).

50. The manubrium, as in Fuchlanis, is three-looped, and dilated at the summit,
unsymmetrically (sﬆe fig. 20). The uncus is broad, composed of five fingers, which
are 8omewhat divergent, and is arched transversely as well as longitudinally, It is
furnished, on that ide which is next to the dorsum, with a peculiar, semicrescentic
process (q), strengthened by a carina : the points of these two processes are opposed
to each other at their tips, beyond the tips of the rami of the incus.

51. The fulcrum of the incus, when viewed ventrally, might be mistaken for a
straight slender rod, with a round, dilated foot (fig. 16). It really consists of two
