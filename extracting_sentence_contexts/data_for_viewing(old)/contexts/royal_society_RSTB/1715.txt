more numerous, the maximum number observed being eight, as shown in Plate 2
fig. 1. Where their number is equal to that of the cortical bundles, they all
quite regularly with the latter, as shown in photograph 1.* Where they are more
numerous, we find the reason is, that certain of the single medullary bundles are [
replaced by a pair (see Plate 21, fig. 1). The alternation, however, is always preserved,

That the medullary bundles are continuous with the cortical leaf-traces is proved â€”

by the fact that we often find bundles in the intermediate position, in the act of passing
out from pith to pericycle. If, as is almost always the case, the stem po
secondary tissues, the bundle is here enclosed by the secondary wood, which has
formed on its outer side only, while behind it is a parenchymatous gap (see Plate 23,
fig. 9). We find examples of these transitional bundles in all positions between pith
and pericycle. In the case figured the bundle is scarcely half-way out. On one side its
own cambium is continuous with that of the rest of the cylinder. On the other side the
main cambium bends inward. In Plate 21, fig. 1 a corresponding bundle, /.t.1, is shown
a little further out. Here the general cambium has already formed behind it. In
the series C.N. 1198-1191 already referred to, a bundle can be traced all the way
from near the pith into the pericycle. At the top of the series another bundle is
just beginning to pass out from the pith.t
