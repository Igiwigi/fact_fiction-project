Snpposition that any adjustment to reduced pressure by the mechanical liberation of gas

| hn take place in this species. It is true that in this case the pressure reduction was
‘onsiderable, although it can hardly be said to haye ocourred with exceptional rapidity,
Br at agreater rate than probably takes place in many Ostariophysez during ordinary
omvtion. Moreover, in Morrau’s experiments with such Ostariophysex as the Carp
‘8nd Tench, the Fishes were exposed to an artificial reduction of pressure, which, if
Bot #o great as in the case of the “* Kilch,” was at least considerable and rapid, and yet
Shroughout the experiment the gradual liberation of successive bubbles of gas enabled
‘he Fish to retain perfect freedom of swimming. It is therefore difficult to avoid the
Sonclusion that the “ Kilch” has either no open pneumatic duct, or, if it has, that the
Bact cannot be utilized for pressure adjustment. A farther item of negative evidence
to be found in the fact that, while retia mirabilia are invariably wanting in all
®stiriophysee, they are present or absent in the remaining Physostomi in much the
‘ae way, and to the same extent, that they are present or wanting in the Physoclisti,
this certainly suggests the inference that gaseous secretion and absorption are
portant factors in pressure adjustment in theee Fishes, From the same point of
view it is somewhat significant that wherever the mechanical liberation of gas has
been proved to take place in Fishes other than the Ostariophysew it is, with one
exception (e.g., Conger), by some other and secondarily acquired means tlan the
retention of the ductus pneumaticus for the purpose. Thus Moreau has shown that
the Physoclist Ocrana: trachwrus is capable of liberating a continuous stream of air
