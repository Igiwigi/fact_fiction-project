explain these papillee, unless they are the remains of the investing gelatinous halo seen
on haustoria which have just penetrated the cell (figs. 37 and 41).

One of the most surprising features of the invaded cells is the longevity of their
cell-contents. Even in preparations of tissue thoroughly infested for some days, and
in which the mycelium has already burst through the epidermis as spore-bearing
pustules, the nucleus, chlorophyll-corpuscles and cytoplasm may retain their form and
colour, and even their normal capacity for staining (see fig. 10 for instance) ; eventually,
however, they are destroyed, but, as I am still occupied with these matters, their
discussion is best postponed, as also the details concerning spore formation.

Returning to the discussion regarding the bearing of these observations on Errks-
son’s hypothesis, it will doubtless be admitted that they place his facts in a totally
new light, and remove the difficulties incident to any attempts to deal with negative
assertions. So long as Errksson merely assumed the existence of the invisible
“mycoplasm” it was practically impossible to refute his hypothesis; all that one
could say was that since the assumed “ mycoplasm” could not be found, no direct
proof was forthcoming, and the matter lay outside the region of science, except in so
far as indirect evidence could be adduced.

The decisive observation, without which it would be impossible to accept
Errksson’s interpretation of his corpuscules spéciaux, would be the discovery of a
young ‘ corpuscule ” duside the cell, and which has given rise to a young vesicle-like
rudiment of « hypha outside. This I have sought for in vain. Hundreds of cases
have been observed where a very small haustorium is attached by a distinct neck,
