Line j, at 70 and 80 atmospheres, affords a good illustration
of this point, and, since this line is, when under pressure, completely on the right-hand
side of the normal line, the phenomenon cannot be referred to an unsymmetrical
broadening. '

Unlike the spectrum of the iron are in this region, no reversals have been observed
under pressure.

5. THE BROADENING OF THE LINES. From the photographs we learn the following facts :—
In the region studied (A 4000 to \ 4600)—

1. All lines broaden under pressure.

2. The broadening increases with the pressure, but different amounts of exposure
necessarily make it difficult to determine if the increase is continuous and linear with
the pressure.
