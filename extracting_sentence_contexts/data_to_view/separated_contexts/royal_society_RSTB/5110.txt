Moreover,
we can certainly perceive a yellow flower, or the yellow tints of the sky at sunrise,
neither of which contain a trace of green. Lastly, | have demonstrated that the fovea and the greater part of the macula region,
both im man and all the true monkeys, is of a pure canary-yellow colour. I discovered
this by examining the macula through the ophthalmoscope when illuminated by light
filtered through a pure spectrum-blue glass, a fact that has since been independently
rediscovered by Prof. Voart by the same method of experiment. Kine demon-
strated the same thing by the chrome-alum method as long ago as 1890. I think I am therefore justified in stating that in the eye there are four primary
colour sensations, and from what I have stated above we have reason to believe that

colour sensations can be perceived in a more or less perfect degree in all Vertebrate
animals, although to a less degree in the Fishes than in the Amphibia and Reptiles,
and considerably less in the latter than in Birds and Mammals.
