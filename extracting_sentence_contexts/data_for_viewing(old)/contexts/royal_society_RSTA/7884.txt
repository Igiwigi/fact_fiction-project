there may be little selective adsorption, and the result may be a rounded crystal
on which no plane faces at all can be distinguished, as if the forces by which atoms
are attracted to the structure had been equalized in every direction. In his examina-
tion of the action of dyes on certain crystals, BuckLEY* has distinguished between the
selective action of a dye on particular crystal faces and a“ colloidal effect’ which is
exerted more generally and often results in the repeated growth of smaller crystal
units. The lyophilic colloids used for this work show both effects, the second in an
eminent degree. Throughout the mass of an apparently homogeneous crystal the
colloid may be present to the extent of about 4% and if the crystal growth
has been allowed to become complex there may be 10% or even more.
Previous work has not as a rule dealt very fully with the amount of absorption into
the crystal, and in fact the amount seems in all but a few cases to have been very
small.

These peculiarities are exhibited by the slightly soluble salts of lead, such as the
chloride and bromide. Lead azide displays more especially a variety of changes in
crystalline habit. It is well known that if a salt is dimorphous, or can be accom-
panied by a hydrated form, a substance added to the solution may affect the stability
of one or other form very considerably. The colloids used will be seen to show this
power very definitely with the bromide and the azide of lead.

The first part of this paper will be mainly descriptive, and will give an account of
the changes in crystal shape and habit, and of the alterations in stability of various
physical forms, which are induced by the presence of dextrine or gum-arabic in the
