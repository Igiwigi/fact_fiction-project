capacities and deducing from those capacities the average volume of the brain, affords,
in some respects, more available data for determining this relative volume for any par-
ticular race than the weighing of the brain itself. It might be less easy in this way to
fix the exact weight of any individual encephalon, which might be much changed by
some lingering and wasting disease (a large portion of Dr. PEAcock's cases died of
Phthisis); but, practically, this method is more sure to yield an accurate average size of
the organ, because we have it in our power to use an unchangeable substance with
which to gauge the capacity of the skull. And we thus arrive at conclusions the same
in result as if we had the brain in all skulls at a uniform density, which, in fact, is the
true basis of comparison. The method followed in the present researches has been to fill each skull, as uniformly
as possible, with clean and dry Calais sand of a definite specific weight, 1425*, 'Then
to pour out the sand, and weigh it carefully. The great difficulty which has always
stood at the threshold of ascertaining the volume of the brain from the mere internal
capacity of a skull, has arisen from the necessity for, and the variable mode of, making
allowance for the other contents of the cranium besides the encephalon, and the uncer-
tainty of the proper amount of such allowance in each special case.
