vous power makes its impression on the nerves themselves. For its degree as
well as existence, then, the power of the latter depends wholly on the former
organs ; and this observation applies as strictly to the ganglionic as to the cere-
bral neryes. 'The brain and spinal marrow therefore possess all the charac-
teristics of the active, the nerves of the passive parts of the system.

It may appear at first sight that the phenomena of what has been termed the
sympathy of nerves oppose the preceding views. On a careful review of these
phenomena, however, they will be found to afford them additional support.
They are all such as depend on changes in the central parts of the nervous
system, and in no degree on any influence of the neryes on each other in their
progress. As I have nothing to add to the statements I have already published
on this subject, for the facts on which the foregoing positions are founded I
beg to refer to the 106th and 107th pages of the third edition of my Inquiry
into the Laws of the Vital Functions.

Another opinion respecting the function of the nerves has been maintained,
and lately by a writer of great respectability *, which deseryes to be considered,
because it claims the support of experiment, and if well founded must essen-
tially affect our opinion of the nature of the neryous influence.

Dr. Hzxsy appears to admit the independence of the muscular power, but
thinks he has rendered it more than probable that the nervous influence,
instead of being only one of many agents, is the only one capable of ex-
citing the muscular fibre ; and consequently that all others act through it, s0
