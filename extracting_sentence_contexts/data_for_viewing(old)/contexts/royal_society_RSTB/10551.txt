iments with single learners, the ‘errors’ made by the initial
participant in each chain were random: one participant
might overproduce fip for giraffe and pig when attempting
to reproduce the perfectly variable language, another might
overproduce that marker for pig, rabbit and cow. In single
chains, these errors get exaggerated over time. But in mul-
tiple-participant chains, because this accidental conditioning
would probably differ between participants, combining the
output of multiple participants should mask the idiosyncratic
conditioning produced by each participant individually.
Thus, given a large enough sample of learners, their collective
output would look perfectly unconditioned, even if each
individual was in fact producing rather conditioned output.

This suggests that in transmission chains where each gen-
eration consists of multiple participants, each learning from
the pooled linguistic output of the entire population at the
previous generation (figure 1b), the emergence of conditioned
variation might not occur at all, or at least might be slower. If
true, this would have important implications for the more
general issue of how learner biases map on to language struc-
ture. In particular, we might expect to see substantial
mismatches between learner biases and language structure.
In the next two subsections, we test this hypothesis using a
