W. GARDINER ON THE CONTINUITY OF THE

removed from it, and finally of the whole cell mechanism. The passage of protoplasgm
from cell to cell, which numerous observations have showed must occur, can now be
explained, and the mere fact of the pogsibility of this taking place increases very
materially our knowledge as to general mechanics of the vegetable cell. Although I am aware of the danger of rushing to conelusions, I cannot but remark
that when these results—which were foreshadowed by Sacns and Haxsreln when
they discovered the perforation of the sieve-plate—are taken in connexion with those
of Rus80w, it appears extremely probable that nob only in the parenchymatous cells
of pulyini, in phloem parenchyma, in endosperm cells, and in the prosenchymatous
bast-fibres, is continuity established from cell to cell, bub that the phenomena is of
much wider, if not of universal occurrence. Finally, I have to acknowledge the many kindnesses I haye received during this
investigation.
