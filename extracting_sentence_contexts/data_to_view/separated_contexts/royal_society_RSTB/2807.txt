the sporangiophores, the latter being regarded as the result of metamorphosis of the
former ; this conclusion was arrived at without considering the Calamarian strobili,
which have a different constitution. The following is a brief statement of the facts
essential for the comparison of the fossils with the modern Hquisetum. Of the Paleozoic Equisetinese that are known, the nearest to the Equisetum type
is the ancient Archeocalamites (Bornia) ;* the leaves were repeatedly branched ; the
furrows of successive internodes did not alternate as they do in Equisetum, but the
cone was for the most part like that of Hquisetwm in having no sterile leaves
intervening between the whorls of eight or ten sporangiophores ; these whorls did not
alternate. There is also evidence of the existence of plants with strobili of the
Equisetum type in the Mesozoic period ; thus the Equwisetwm type of strobilus was no
recent departure.
