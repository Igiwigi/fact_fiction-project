How many caustics is it reasonable to expect?

Constructing a Birkhoff billiard with at least one caustic is easy: it is enough to perform the
so-called string construction, similar to the well-known one to draw a circle as the set of points
equidistant from a fixed centre, or to construct an ellipse as the locus of points whose distances
from two fixed points have a constant sum. More specifically (see, e.g. [4, ch. 5] for more details),
given a curve y, one could wrap a closed non-stretchable string around it (of length longer than
the one of y), pull it tight at a point and move this point around y: the curve that one obtains
corresponds to a billiard domain that has y as a caustic.

Are there other billiards with infinitely many caustics? Quite surprisingly, the answer is
affirmative: all (sufficiently smooth) Birkhoff billiards have infinitely many smooth convex
caustics that accumulate to the boundary of the billiard domain. In fact, Lazutkin [24] introduced
a very special change of coordinates that reduces the billiard map Bg to a very simple form. Let
Le :R/tZ x [0,7] > R/Z x [0,4] with small 6 > 0 be given by

‘
(y) =Lols,9) = (ca! I, p 7 (r)dz, 4Cg'o'/°(s) sin 7) ,

where p denotes the radius of curvature of 02, and Cg := Sb p2/3(s) ds (sometimes called the
Lazutkin perimeter). In these new coordinates, the billiard map becomes a more simple expression:

Boz, =(x+y + O(y?),y + O(y')).

In particular, near the boundary {y=0}, this map can be seen as a small perturbation of
