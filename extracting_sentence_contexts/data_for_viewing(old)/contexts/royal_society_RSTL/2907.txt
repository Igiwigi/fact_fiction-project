The sncceeding transits of the moon being denoted by the letters A, B, C, D, E,F;
and F heing the time of the moon's transit which immediately precedes the time of
bigh water at London, my last discussion of the London Dock observations was in-
s$tituted with reference to transit B : the present discussion of the observations made
at Liverpool between the 1st of January 1774 and the 31st of December 1792, by
Mr. HuTcaixson, has been instituted with reference to transit AF, or that which
precedes the time of high water at Liverpool by about 2% 0" 20%-9. This paper con-
tains, in fact, two sets of tables precisely similar; the one set deduced from 13,391
obseryations of high water made at Liverpool by Mr. HuTcnnso0N, and the other set
deduced from 24,592 observations of high water at the Wapping entrance of the

* The former discussion by Mr. Dxss100, given in the Philosophical Transactions for 1835, was made with
reference to the transit immediately preceding.
+ T had intended the transit B to be used as the argument : the mistake was not perceived until the work
was too far adyanced to make it worth while to have recommenced,
