It is thus a fact that within the life-range of temperature of these dissociable
water-containing salts the uniaxial figure is produced for every wave-length of the
visible spectrum, and for each wave-length there is a definite temperature at which
these interesting monoclinic crystals simulate uniaxial symmetry as regards their
optical properties while retaining morphologically their exterior monoclinic sym-
metry.

The interference figures of cesium magnesium selenate given in the Plate opposite
p- 272 are almost equally applicable to cesium magnesium sulphate.

With regard to-the effect of rise of temperature on potassium magnesium and

rubidium magnesium selenates, it was observed that the optic axial angle of the
