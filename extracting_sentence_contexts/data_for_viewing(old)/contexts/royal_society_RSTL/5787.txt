Yhat form the commencement of the fasciculus teres and the continuation of the hypo-
Slossal nucleus: as in the case of the vagus, the anterior portion of the nerve, forming a
Slistinet bundle, turns inwards round the summit of the antero-lateral column, and pass-
Ang through the most anterior and largest cells, sends forward a series of returning
loops, first through the antero-posterior bundles along the inner border of the caput
cornts posterioris, and then in succession through the network of the lateral column, as
it makes its way towards the raphe (see fig. 36, Plate XVIL.); but in this course its
fibres lie side by side with those which have been already described as proceeding from
the antero-lateral column in the same direction to decussate through the raphe with their
opposite fellows, 80 that it becomes almost impossible to identify them and ascertain if
they share in the decussation ; that, they do 80, however, is rendered extremely probable
by the fact that in Birds all the fibres of the eighth pair of nerves, of which the highest
correspond to the glos80pharyngeal, may be distinctly seen to decussate through the
