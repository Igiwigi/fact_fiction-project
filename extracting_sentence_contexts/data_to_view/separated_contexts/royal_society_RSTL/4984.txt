The ratios of disturbance in the years
1846, 1847 and 1848, were nearly twice as great as in the years 1843, 1844 and
1845. Did there occur any notable differences of either local or general temperature,
or thermometrical peculiarities of any description, in the years in question, to which
variations of such magnitude in the ratios of magnetic disturbance can be ascribed,
or with which they can be connected ? We should not however derive all the advantage which an examination of the
ratios in Table XIII. seems suited to afford to those who desire to obtain an insight
into the character of the variations they represent, were we to overlook the still
more remarkable fact which they manifest, of a general, and with a single exception,
5; uninterrupted progressive increase in the amount of disturbance from a minimum
in 1843 to a maximum in 1848. The interruption is in 1845, when the ratios, both of numbers and yalues, are less
than in 1844. This interruption of the perfect continuity of the progression occurs
alike at both stations; it is not of large amount, and is the sole exception to an
otherwise continuous increase in the amount of disturbance during the years com-
prebended in this investigation.
