The fact that all transitional stages are found between small Orbulina she
containing a perfect spire of chambers, and large onés which are empty, appears to
point to the conclusion that the empty Orbulina shells when small contained such
chambers. What is the relation between the Orbulina shell and the contained chambers? The suggestion that these constitute a young individual about to be set free i
incompatible with the facts (1) that they are attached to and sometimes involved in
the Orbulina shell; (2) that they are often seen in stages of degeneration ; and (3)
that the largest Orbulina shells are empty and complete. According to Major Owen’s view, the outer sphere may be regarded as a “ wild
growing closing-in chamber,” and it appears probable that this is the correct inter-
pretation. The Globigerina chambers, with their radiating spines, are probably
invested with vacuolated protoplasm before the Orbulina chamber is formed, as the
Orbulina shell is afterwards.
