Aside from work in actual Reverse
Mathematics, research within the field often concerns the abstract theory of Reverse Mathematics
itself, the study of the axiomatic systems for its own sake, the study of models of the theory and
the relation between subsystems of Z2 and other systems of first- or higher-order arithmetic or of
set theory. A general reference for the subject is Simpson [3]. We also refer the reader to Dean and
Walsh [4] for an overview of the historical context of the development of Reverse Mathematics
going back to Poincaré.

(b) Ordinal Analysis

Gentzen [5] gave the first proof (two, in fact) of the consistency of number theory (more precisely,
PA). By Gédel’s theorem, such a proof must necessarily go beyond the means of arithmetic itself,
and the way this happens in Gentzen’s proof is interesting. The proof follows a direct, explicit,
inductive construction which reduces a putative proof z of a contradiction to a simpler such
proof, eventually producing a proof so simple that it can be verified directly 7 could not exist.
