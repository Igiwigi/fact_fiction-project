This is important at least from
a conceptual view point, but in practice L can be too large to estimate the KS entropy
accurately. Nevertheless, ordinal analysis with a small L is useful in descriptive data
analysis. The fact that conditional variants of permutation entropy seem better estimators
of the KS entropy than the original concepts is certainly worth further research [70].

4. As permutations, ordinal L-patterns are elements of the symmetric group of degree L. This additional algebraic structure of the symbols allows applications to the analysis of
coupled dynamics [80,81].
