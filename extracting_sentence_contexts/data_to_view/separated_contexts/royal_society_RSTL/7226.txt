This impression regarding their nature is rendered even maze
probable by what we 8e in Prosthecosacter inflexus (Plate XXVII. figs. 1 & 2,
It seems, moreover, difficult to imagine what could be the nse of Papillee in thes
situations, though it does appear to be a pretty constant rule amongst the Nematoi≈øh
for the deep cellular layer of the integument to communicate with the exterior
means of channels through the chitinous envelope. No fine integumental po es,
such as we have hitherto described, exist in the majority of the parasitic Nematoid
but 80 far as we have examined, both ErrrTa, SCHNEIDER, and myself have found
in these animals the larger cervical and caudal openings. May they not be looks
upon as in a measure substitutes for one another? 'This opinion is also supported by
the fact that the surface-depression into which they open is occasionally 80 marked
to discountenance the idea that they are to be looked upon as papille. The vie
entertained by EBgRTA, that these pores are openings of the water-yascular system, |
have no hesitation in believing to be erroneous. SCHNEIDER also is quite opposed &
this interpretation of their function.
