Under these circumstances it seems that the term “crystal” should only be used with
some qualification in speaking of the patches developed by etching the surface of
commercial tin-plate. In a erystal which is undistorted by elastic strain constancy
of orientation of the elements is an essential characteristic of a true crystal. Some
light is thrown on this matter by the fact that we have not observed this “ concave”
appearance in samples of solid tin, but only on commercial tin-plate where we are
dealing with a very thin layer of tin adhering to sheet-iron, Even in tin-plate this
effect may be made to disappear by re-melting the tin over a flame and allowing it
to cool slowly and at rest. The appearance produced on re-etching such a specimen
is shown in fig. 31 (to the same scale as fig, 28).
