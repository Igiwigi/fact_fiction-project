where a is the radius of the bubble at time (¢+4 D/U) after the explosion, U being the mean
propagation velocity of the shock-wave.

It is seen that the second or afterflow term in (A 2-9) is different from the corresponding
term in (A 2:6). This is due to the fact that whereas an acoustic shock-wave travels through
the water without any further expenditure of energy, the incompressive afterflow depends
for its transport on the actual movement of the whole mass of water.
