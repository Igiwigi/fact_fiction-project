The heat of formation of hydrogen from atomic hydrogen is based on spectroscopic
and calorimetric determinations, whereas the heat resulting from the formation of
water vapour from OH and hydrogen is derived from explosion experiments by Lewis
and von Elbe (1935 4). The heats of formation of oxygen and nitrogen have a spectro-
scopic basis,

With regard to the compressibility characteristics of the various gas mixtures both
before and after explosion, it was considered reasonably safe to assume that under the
high temperatures reached in the explosion the perfect gas state was attained. Direct
experimental determinations could, however, be made in regard to the unburnt
mixture at the charging pressure and temperature and this was, in fact, done. The
method and apparatus are described in the Supplement.

Reference has already been made to determinations of specific heat based on
spectroscopic data. Workers in this field are confident in the accuracy of their results
so far as the diatomic gases are concerned and place considerable reliance on the values
obtained for some of the triatomic gases. It is, therefore, of great interest to compare
these “spectroscopic values” with those obtained in the present investigation and,
as this has been done, it is necessary to give the source of the spectroscopic values that
have been used. During the last few years Giauque (1930 a, 6; Giauque and Overstreet
1932; Clayton and Giauque 1932), Johnston and their co-workers (Johnston and
