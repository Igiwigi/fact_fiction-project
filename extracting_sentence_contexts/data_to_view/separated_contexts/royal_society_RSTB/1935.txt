37, 38). In another case (fig. 39), they occurred on
the under side of a narrow, flat continuation of the prothallus immediately behind
the middle lobe which terminated in a sporangium. The absence of any formation of vegetative organs of the sporophyte, except the
ramenta just described in the cultures of Nephrodiwm dilatatum is, when compared
with the not infrequent presence of sporangia, a striking fact, and one which must
be taken into account in attempting to estimate the importance to be attached to
the occurrence of the latter members. Returning to the consideration of the structure of the different parts of the
prothalli, the general habit of which has now been described and illustrated, the
middle lobe may be first considered. Where typically developed, this is of triangular
outline ; its size varies.
