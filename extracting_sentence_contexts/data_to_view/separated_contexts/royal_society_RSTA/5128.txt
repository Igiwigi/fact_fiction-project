It describes the fundamental building blocks of matter (quarks and leptons), as well as the
interactions among them which are mediated by gauge bosons, which are particles with unit
spin. The mediator of the electromagnetic interaction is the photon, the mediators of the strong
interaction among quarks inside protons and neutrons are the gluons, while the gauge bosons
responsible for weak interactions are the heavy W and Z bosons. Indeed, the fact that the W and Z
bosons are so massive, while the photon is massless, is a manifestation of the breaking of electroweak
symmetry, which is at the heart of the unification of electromagnetic and weak interactions. This
has resulted in a plethora of theoretical attempts (not only in the 1960s) to find mechanisms that
can explain this breaking of electroweak symmetry and, if possible, to also explain how the matter : =
particles acquire mass, while at the same time preserving all the good properties of the theory, in 3
particular gauge symmetry and renormalizability. One ‘simple’ solution to this problem consists
in the introduction of an additional scalar (spin zero) particle, called the Higgs boson, which nee)
interacts with matter particles and gauge bosons and thus explains their masses in a dynamical :
manner.
