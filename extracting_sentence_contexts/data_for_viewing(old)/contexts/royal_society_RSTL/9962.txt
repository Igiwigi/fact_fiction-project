5 fallacy to which the estimation of after-effects is especially liable, viz.: that after a
'5 given duration of current, with a given deflection of the needle, a given interval is
2 followed by a greater deflection which rapidly subsides to the original deflection—a
2 phenomenon which may repeat itself several times in guccession, and obtains whether
RS the electrodes are kept in broken or in closed circuit during the interval. Without
S committing ourselves to any positive statement, we may remark that our observations
led us to suppose that during the passage of the galvanic current, an opposed electro-
S motive force is developed within the body which rapidly subsides. But however this
—S may be, the importance of these alterations of current-strength as a source of fallacy
Z are obvious, and they especially concern the question of after-effects. We have not
E been able as yet to assign to them their exact share for and against the-manifestation
Z of the after-effects. But we have, we think, succeeded in demonstrating the rough
A facts in spite of the fallacy, and it will be one of the objects of a future paper to find
numerical expression for this vague quantity.

Finally we may mention a further pozsible source of error, which however cannot be
eliminated should it exist, viz.: the unequal alteration by the current of the condue-
tivity of the nerve and of the surrounding tiszues. It is conceivable that the conduc-
tivity of the surroundings of nerve should be increased in a greater proportion than

Strome,” &c. Deutsches Archiv f. Klin. Med., 1876, p. 264). He lays stress upon the fallacies arising
from alterations in the current-strength, and used the galvanic tes only. He states that K,C.C. is
increased after K.D., and variable after A.D.; that A.C.OC. is increased after K.D., and variable after A.D,
He does not scem to have determined any alteration of the opening contraction,
