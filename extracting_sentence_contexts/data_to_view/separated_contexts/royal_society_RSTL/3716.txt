And here
it is important to refer toa remark made in a former page (par, 16), that the filament
has a tendency to become membranous at the surface, and that it contains within
itself the elements of other filaments: both of which qualities may be recognized,
as the filament is passing into the toothed fibre.

63. From my observations on vegetable structure, to be presently referred to (par.
68), I venture to anticipate that the toothed fibre noticed by Scuwanx in the epi-
dermis of a Grass, and considered by him as corresponding to that of Brewsrer in
the lens, will be found to have the same mode of origin. Facts observed in the Structure of Blood-vessels, Mould, Woody Fibre, Hair,
Feathers, &c.

64. In examining the coats of a large blood-vessel, I had noticed the filaments of
one stratum to cross those of another stratum at right angles. But what was my
surprise, when subsequently directing my attention to the structure of the arachnoid,
at the remarkable display of filaments in the vessels of the pia mater (fig. 16.) !
