Watson proposed to call the “ quadrate,” which bounds
the true quadrate on the outer side, quadrato-jugal and for this there may be, no
doubt, much to be said. On the other hand the numerous and important features
which connect Lysorophus with the Urodeles suggest the squamosal; for in that
group it is the squamosal which in all its relations most recalls the bone in question. But if this be admitted then the bone which has hitherto been called “ squamosal ”
becomes the supra-temporal (fig. 4) and in support of this interpretation it may be
re-called that PARKER and Berrany* in their account of the skull of Amblystoma
make mention of the fact that on the right side of the specimen which they figure
“the postero-superior angle of the squamosal is converted into a distinct small supra-
temporal bone.”

Lysorophus would thus appear to furnish us with an additional instance of that
overlap of the squamosal by the supra-temporal which is so marked a feature in
Ichthyosaurus. Before closing this part of my subject I should like to express my deep sense of
the obligations I am under to my friend and colleague, Mr. Gooprica.
