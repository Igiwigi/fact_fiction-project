He has responded to my request by forwarding to me copies of a
great variety of measurements, which will be largely used in a paper on variation in man. PROF, K. PEARSON ON THE MATHEMATICAL THEORY OF EVOLUTION. 281

An examination of the above numbers brings out a fact which [ am not sure has
been noted before : namely, the alteration from dolicocephaly to brachycephaly appears
to chiefly depend upon an alteration in the breadth and not in the length of the skull. We see too that, if variation be judged, not by standard-deviations, but by the
coefficients of variation advocated in this paper, the breadth of skull is in all cases a
sensibly more variable quantity than the length, and, further—a point to which I
shall return on another occasion—that the more civilised races are the more variable. Both of these results have, I believe, very important bearing on the mathematico-
statistical theory of evolution, On the present occasion the above example is only

Sigiven to illustrate the relation of variation to correlation.
