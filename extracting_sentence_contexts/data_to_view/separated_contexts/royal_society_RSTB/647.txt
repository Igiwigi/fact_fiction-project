It may here be mentioned that in the case of R. circularis, the nuclear lamina
is in some respects more highly differentiated than in RA, batis, It presents a
striated appearance (n.l., fig. 14a), and thus resembles the corresponding lamina
in the Torpedo, which is especially characterised by the “palisade” of Remak—
the “nerve hairs” of Ranvier, The resemblance between the nervous lamina of
the Skate and the Torpedo will be at once evident if fig. 14a is compared with
figs. 55 and 56 (Plate 19) in Frrrscu’s recent monograph.§

The striation of the nervous lamina is probably of little significance, but the fact
that in one of the Skates (22. cireularis) there is a palisade-like arrangement, helps to
show that while a complete electric element in the Skate differs greatly from a
complete element in the Torpedo, the essential parts are practically identical. The nuclear lamina of the electric layer (Plate 28, nuc.l., figs. 14 and 14a) consists
of a layer of granular protoplasm, in which numerous large oval nuclei are imbedded at
nearly regular intervals, The protoplasm immediately around the nuclei seems to be
