The prints are absolutely
permanent, and the records obtained by it can be referred to at any time, and
re-measured if necessary. Further, the paper keeps well before exposure, and after
exposure and before development. When kept dry in an air-tight box with calcium
chloride in contact with the air, in fact, it will keep unaltered in sensitiveness for
several months. As an example of this it may be mentioned that two pieces of paper
cut from the same sheet were each exposed to various and similar intensities of light
for equal times. One was developed on the potassium oxalate solution immediately
after exposure, and the other was not developed till about six weeks had elapsed ; on
measuring the greys on the two papers their darkness was found to be precisely the
same, and the unexposed parts equally white in the two cases.
