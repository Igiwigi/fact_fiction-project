The point can be settled by anyone

they do come together during their backstro.
studying a living Daphnia on its back, or, better still, a living Simocephalus which
naturally feeds on its back. I have observed both, and found that while the limbs
to a slight degree during their backwards and forwards movements
their edges never touch. â€˜This is evident from the fact that it is possible to observe
the floor of the food groove accurately throughout the limb movement. If the limbs
touched at any time during their motion this would cut off the view of the food groove,
and with limbs moving with such a low frequency as those of Daphnia, an interruption
of this sort would completely obscure the food groove. Not only can the food groove
be seen, but the tips of the moving filter combs can be watched.
