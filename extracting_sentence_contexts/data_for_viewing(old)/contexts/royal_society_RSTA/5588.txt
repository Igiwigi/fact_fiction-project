simulation. Note that for several periods of time even two V;; are found around C3. (Online version in colour.)

During the simulation shown in figure 5 only in one other cage (C2), not directly next to C3,
a Lif was present for a short time that was generated as part of a Frenkel pair with a V;; on C1.
Similar to the Frenkel pair observed above for the Sp, defect its lifetime again is approximately
1 ps after which it was annihilated again. Later at around 8.9 ps, when again two V;; have been
present around C3, a Lit jumped from C1 to C3 to refill one of them. This is the only jump
which, instead of an interstitial jump mechanism, could likewise be regarded as a vacancy jump
mechanism.

In summary, we found that a Brg defect facilitates the generation of Frenkel pairs with rather
mobile Lif. The Vj, by contrast, seem to be strongly bound to the Lit cage around the Brg defect.
This defect-induced Frenkel pair is formed regardless of the fact that one V;; has already been
introduced to the system as compensating defect for Brg. The reason for this is most probably
due to the electrostatics: the Br~ on the 4d site has a weaker attraction for Lit compared to the
nominal S?~. Moreover, the strong attraction of $*~ on the surrounding 4d sites is even able to
regularly strip another Lit from the Lit cage around Brg leaving back two V;;. The generated
Lij is highly mobile which is most likely due to a combination of high Lit mobility inside the
Li* cages and structural frustration [8]. As a result, the Lif is able to travel easily through all 12
nearest neighbour cages around the Brg defect. With that, an extended spatial area is involved
with Li* transport only because of one single BrÂ§ defect. A larger concentration of Brg defects


will, despite lowering the overall Li content, presumably induce a larger concentration of Frenkel
pairs and with that also more mobile Lif. Such a behaviour most likely explains the increasing
