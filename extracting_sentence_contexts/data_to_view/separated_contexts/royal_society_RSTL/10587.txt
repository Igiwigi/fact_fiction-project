2. In this case there would be a preliminary difficulty in explaining the formation of
the black, inasmuch as when the point P' was reached any further decrease in thick-
ness would be resisted by an increase in tension. As a matter of fact, however, the
black is generally firs formed in small specks, and if, owing to a gudden disturbance,
the film were thinned to below the maximum of surface tension, equilibrium would be
poxsible if the thickness were that corresponding to Q‚Äù. The parts of the film of
thickness intermediate to P' and Q' would shrink, and an apparent discontinuity

would be established. ON THE THICKNESS AND SURFACE TENSTON OF LIQUID FILMS, 683

This 8upposition is als0 less satisfactory than the last, inasmuch as the equilibrium
would be nnstable.
