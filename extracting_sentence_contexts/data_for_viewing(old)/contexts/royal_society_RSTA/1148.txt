Agency confirmed the recovery of Sphagnum after 2010, with no evidence of any recovery in
Calluna (figure 9b). The latter effect may be age-dependent, where recovery of old Calluna plants
(weakened or dead) is limited, while ultimately conditions may favour recolonization by young
Calluna plants.

(a) Mechanisms of ammonia impacts on vegetation

The examples presented highlight the increased sensitivity of lichens and bog vegetation to
gaseous NH3 compared with wet deposited NH4y* and NO3_, which appears to be at least partly
related to the alkaline effect of NH3. In this way, higher correlations were found between Lan and
NHs in the UK-scale lichen survey than with total N deposition. In fact, the highest single-factor
correlation was found with the ratio of N to S deposition (electronic supplementary material,
