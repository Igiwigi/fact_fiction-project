That there should be a common explanation of two such similar
sets of phenomena appears to be almost certain, and in the case of the absorptive
surface no explanation appears possible other than that already given, and postulating


254 DR. H. T. BROWN AND MR. F. ESCOMBE ON STATIC DIFFUSION OF

the existence of a system of overlying equi-density shells brought into existence
by the converging streams of the gas on their way to the absorbing surface. There is, however, one important difference between the behaviour of absorbing
dises, and of perforations in a septum dividing two regions of different density. In
the former case, as we have just seen, the absorption, according to linear dimensions,
is extremely sensitive to any disturbance which may be supposed to affect the
stability of the overlying “ shells,’ whereas in the case of a perforated diaphragm,
through which, for instance, atmospheric carbon dioxide is diffusing, no special pre-
cautions to keep the outer air quite still are requisite; in fact, we may obtain good
indications of the “ diameter law” under these conditions from air which is in distinct
movement, a movement far more than sufficient to sweep away and destroy the
efficacy of any shells over an absorbing alkaline solution of the same shape and
size. In the case of the absorbent disc, the convergent hyperbolic lines of flux of the
carbon dioxide all terminate in the surface of the disc, and normal to it, where they
are trapped by the absorbent. (See fig.
