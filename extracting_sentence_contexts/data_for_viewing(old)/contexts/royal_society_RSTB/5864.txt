*The brainweight of this crocodile was 13-9 gr., the length of the body 3-4 m., the bodyweight approxi-
mately 120 kg., rather more than less.

From this we see that the cephalisation in birds is much higher than in the most
highly cephalised reptiles—including what perhaps is their nearest reptilian relative,
the crocodile—and that in several birds it is higher than in many mammals, and in
parrots it even comes near that of the Canidae and Felidae.

The high cephalisation of parrots explains the fact that while in adult humming birds
(Craicie, 1928) and various other birds (HuBER and Crospy, 1929) there still
remains both medially and laterally a small ventricular split, this small lateral split is
entirely obliterated in parrots, the medial ventricular space has become extremely
small, and nearly the whole forebrain has become one solid mass.

The size of the brain case being apparently limited, the nervous substance fills up all
the space available. This also happens in thé midbrain, the ventricle of which is
equally reduced, while the tecta optica are pushed down by the caudal pole of the fore-
brain, thus making as much use as possible of the available endocranial space.

Anyone who has dissected an avian brain knows how closely the central nervous
system in these animals lies against the neurocranium, a fact also demonstrated by
