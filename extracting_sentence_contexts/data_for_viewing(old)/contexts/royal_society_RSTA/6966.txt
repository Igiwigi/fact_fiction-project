Two methods are possible for the simultaneous satisfaction of the differential equation and
the boundary condition. First, the finite-difference form (A. 6) of the differential equation
can be applied at all internal points. The equation at a point 1 adjacent to the boundary will
then involve the unknown boundary value at 0, and the boundary condition is used to obtain
an expression for its value in terms of values at internal points. The finite-difference expression
for a derivative at the end-point 0 of a range is given by

h(dw/dx), = AkR—4A3-+4A3—JA$+.... (A.7)

This formula, however, is rather slowly convergent, and an alternative method is preferable.

In this second method the equation (A. 6) is applied at boundary points such as 0 in
figure 1, as well as at internal points. A ‘fictitious’ point —1 is now introduced, and the
boundary condition is used to obtain its value, in terms of those at points on and internal to
the boundary, from a much more rapidly convergent expression.

With reference to figure 2, it can be shown that at a boundary point such as 0 the derivative
is given by

h(dw/dx), = AL, os ius M,, (A. 8)
