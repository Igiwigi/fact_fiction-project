M. WARD ON THE MORPHOLOGY AND THE

and allowed to roll over in fluid under the microscope, the form and arrangement are
found to be somewhat as sketched in fig. 12 (Plate 43), where « represents the view
from below, b that from the side, and c an end elevation of the structure. The cell A,
in fact, is becoming gradually enfolded by the layer of cells derived from B, a process
which results, at a Jater period (Plate 43, fig. 17) in the almost complete tucking in
of the © core” as the centre of a snbglobular mass of cells. As this process of © invagination by epiboly ” (as ib would be termed in the case of

an embryo) goes on, the * core ” has been more slowly cub up into cells—-at first by
walls perpendicular to its long axis, and then by septa in other planes at right angles
—and the sub-globular body thus produced lies with the open part towards the
epidermis. After this period, two events occur : 1st, the cells of the * core,” possessing very
thin walls, acquire a different aspect from those of the outer shell; their finely
granular protoplasm makes them appear denser and more opaque, shining through the
latter until this becomes too thick to be transparenb ; 2nd, the open part of the
growing perithecium becomes closed over, and the internal structures can no longer
be made out without the aid of actual sections.
