this into the litre conical flask, and boiling under reflux to remove carbon dioxide.
After cooling, the excess of sulphuric acid is titrated back with baryta and the carbon
dioxide calculated. The solution is then filtered from the precipitate of barium
sulphate, and the filtrate evaporated to dryness. The residue of barium salts of the
volatile acids is weighed and its carbon content determined by wet combustion.

From the weight of the barium salts of the volatile acids, their titration value,
and their carbon content, it is possible to obtain an approximate idea as to their
composition.

(3d) Carbon as non-volatile acids.—The problem of the separation of the non-volatile
acids proved to be difficult of solution. A reasonably satisfactory method was
obtained, however, by taking advantage of the fact that, while the calcium salts of the
volatile acids are relatively soluble in alcohol, those of the non-volatile acids are
practically insoluble. The experimental basis for this was obtained by determining
the solubilities in 80 per cent. alcohol of the calcium salts of a number of acids likely
to be met with in fermentation processes. This was carried out by adding to 20 c.c.
of a saturated aqueous solution of the calcium salt of the acid under investigation
80 ¢.c. of 97 per cent. alcohol, making a final volume of 100 ¢.c. The mixture, after
standing overnight, was filtered, an aliquot part evaporated to dryness, the residue
ignited with strong sulphuric acid and the calcium sulphate weighed. From this the
weight of organic acid present originally as the calcium salt was calculated.

The results obtained are given in Table II. 6
