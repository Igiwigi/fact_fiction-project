abundance of different values of i is so much affected by (1) our choice of what strains
should be carried on and to what extent, and (2) our judgment as to what may fairly
be called separate strains. Certain strains and their substrains have been bred much
more extensively than others, and in closely-related strains it is difficult to be consistent
in deciding what degree of difference constitutes distinction. We cannot be sure that
the peaks represent anything more than selective breeding. The evidence as a whole
is consistent with the view that the most completely « and ¢ strains are the end terms
of a graded series ; on the other hand, established « and « strains are very distinct from
one another and the border-line groups (& between 1 and 10) occur mostly in places in
the pedigrees where it is not unreasonable to suppose that heterozygous K E groups
might be present.

The main facts about the occurrence and behaviour of < strains will be best appre-
hended by a study of the pedigree tables, especially I and VI. The data have been
pretty thoroughly analysed in a variety of ways, of which it is impossible to give a
full discussion. The following summary covers the chief points :—

(a) Origin and progress of < strains —EK broods may occur anywhere in sinistral lines
or as the recessive component of heterozygous dextrals. In both our line-bred families
sinistral strains have sooner or later given E broods among K broods. A number of
these E broods when bred on have established < groups and strains composed exclusively
or predominantly of further E broods ; others have established « lines. Heterozygous
dextrals may break up into A and E (e.g., Table TV) as well as into A and K,
and ¢ groups have also been extracted from A x K and A x E crosses (below, p. 111).
