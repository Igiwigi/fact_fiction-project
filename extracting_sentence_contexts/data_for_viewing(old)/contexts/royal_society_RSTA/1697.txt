are continuous for every compact subset K C X. This certainly holds if ¢ is a jointly continuous
semiflow. On the other hand, if X is compactly generated, then so is Rs x X (see [31,
Theorem 4.4]) and therefore the continuity of these mappings imply that ¢ is jointly continuous.

To finish the proof, we show that J, is locally equicontinuous whenever ¢ is jointly continuous.
We note that by [28, Corollary I.1.7], a set M of linear mappings on C;,(X) is equicontinuous if and
only if for every norm bounded subset F € C,,(X) the set M|r of restrictions to F is equicontinuous
with respect to the compact-open topology. But—given to > 0—for the set

Mry = {To(#) | t € [0, tol},

even more is true: it is equicontinuous with respect to the compact-open topology on the whole
space C),(X). In fact, if KC X is a compact subset, then L :=¢g([0,to] x K) is still compact and
pK(To(t)f) < pL(f) for every t € [0, to] and every f € C,(X). a

Remark 2.11. When dealing with semigroups on Banach spaces with an additional locally
convex topology there is a second natural approach besides looking at mixed topologies. Taking
into account both topologies at once, one can use the concept of the so-called bi-continuous
sentigroups for which there is a rather rich theory (e.g. [9,37,38]). It follows from Proposition 2.10
that Koopman semigroups associated with jointly continuous semiflows on compactly generated
completely regular spaces X form a bi-continuous semigroup with respect to the norm and the
compact-open topologies. It should also be noted that in some cases the class of bi-continuous
semigroups on Cp(X) with respect to the compact-open topology is strictly larger than the one of
locally equicontinuous, strongly continuous semigroups with respect to the mixed topology, see
[39, Example 4.1]. However, if X is a Polish space or a o-compact, locally compact space, then both
