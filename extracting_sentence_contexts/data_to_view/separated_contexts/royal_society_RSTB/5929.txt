Moreover, it is not everywhere perfectly continuous, there being small areas
where the endometrial tissue directly bounds the intervillous space. It contains sparse
nuclei, varying in size but mostly large, ovalish and vesicular. That this peripheral syncytial layer possesses invasive and cytolytic properties is
clearly indicated by the fact that processes of it penetrate into the underlying endo-
metrial tissue and by the characters of the latter. As can be seen in Pl. 10, fig. 62, the
narrow superficial zone of endometrial tissue underlying the syncytial layer presents
quite a different appearance to that of the deep zone, being less uniform, looser and
distinctly cedematous in character. In it there are present numbers of enlarged capillaries, the endothelial walls of which
are more or less altered.
