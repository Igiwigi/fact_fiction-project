near the boundary of the billiard table, ie. with small rotation numbers. Innami’s proof is based : =

given in [31].

Remark 4.4. Very interestingly, Treschev [21] gives numerical indication that there might exist
analytic billiards, different from ellipses, for which the dynamics in a neighbourhood of the
elliptic period-2 orbit is conjugate to a rigid rotation. These billiards could be seen as an instance of
local integrability; however, this regime is somehow complementary to the one usually considered
for Birkhoff conjecture. Here one has local integrability in a neighbourhood of an elliptic periodic
orbit of period 2 (leading to homotopically trivial invariant curves for the billiard map), while
Birkhoff conjecture is usually concerned with integrability in a neighbourhood of the boundary
of the billiard table. However, this fact—if verified—would provide an extremely interesting
indication that these two regimes of integrability do differ.

Remark 4.5. Birkhoff conjecture can also be thought of as an analogue, in the case of billiards,
in the following task: classifying integrable (Riemannian) geodesic flows on T?. The complexity of
this question, of course, depends on the notion of integrability that one considers. If one assumes
that the whole space is foliated by invariant Lagrangian graphs (i.e. the system is C°-integrable),
then it follows from Hopf conjecture [32] (see also [33] for the proof in dimensions greater than 2)
that the associated metric must be flat. Bialy and Wojtkowski’s results in the billiard setting can
be considered as the analogues of this result.

However, the question becomes more challenging—and it is still open—if one considers
integrability only on an open and dense set (global integrability), or assumes the existence of
