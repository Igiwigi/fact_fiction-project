To illustrate this further, suppose that instead of M we have the matrix
M*=( a, þ Y=( &+de , bla+d) ),

s that L*=M?, we find

P=(a+d)*—2(ad—bc),
Q=(ad—be)*,
and thence /Q=+(ad—dbe). Taking the positive sign, we have
Y =ad—be,
X=+(a+4),

and these values give simply
L=EC a4 J==+M,

But taking the negative sign,
i - at
X=+V/(a—d)*+46e,

and retaining X to denote this radical, we find

which may also be written

L=%#4 ( @, b )_2(a—b9) (1, 0 ),

or, what is the 8ame thing.

—_a+d 2(ad—be) .

and it is easy to verify @ posteriori that this value in fact gives 1*—=M*. It may be
remarked that if

W=o 1, 0 Y=1,
[ 0, 1|
we have X=0; it will be 8een presently that the

=1 admits of other solutions besides L=+1. The example shows how the
s of the fractional Powers of a matrix are to be investigated.
