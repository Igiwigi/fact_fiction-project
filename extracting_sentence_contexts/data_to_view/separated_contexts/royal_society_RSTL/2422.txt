The extent of this declination will depend on the
velocity of rotation and the diameter of this small circle, and
will be proportional to both, thatis, to the velocity of rotation
multiplied into the sine of the angle made by the axis of rota-
tion with the direction of the dip. It will therefore be a maxi-
mum when the axis of rotation is perpendicular to the magnetic
meridian, and vanish when the shell is made to revolve on
an axis parallel to the line of dip, These consequences are
perfectly consonant to the results obtained by Mr. BarLow
in his paper ; and in fact, the general result announced by him
in (page 326 of this volume) comes to the very same thing
as above stated ; for it is obvious, that the new axis of polar-
ization there spoken of, acting in combination with the origi-
nal, or, as we may call it, the primary axis developed in the
quiescent state of the shell, will exert a compound force on
the needle, such as would be exerted by a single equivalent
axis situated intermediately between them, but much nearer to
the more intense than to the more feeble one. The position of
this equivalent axis will necessarily be in the great circle
passing through the two component ones. Now the small
circle described by the point which was first the pole of the
stronger or primary axis about the axis of rotation is a tan-
gent to this great cirele, and the equivalent axis (being but
little removed from the primary one, by reason of the small
intensity of the other), will therefore have its pole situate
indifferently in either circle.
