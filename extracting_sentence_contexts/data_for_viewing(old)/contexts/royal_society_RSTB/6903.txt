minute and visible with difficulty. Penard (1921) remarks that if there were indeed
two, the form must have been Stokestella Lemmermann, not Bicoeca. The former genus
was created by Lemmermann (1914) to contain five species of flagellates from fresh-
water ascribed by Stokes (1888) to the genus Bicoeca. This question of the presence
or absence of an accessory flagellum is one which requires very careful attention. In
the three forms which I have had an opportunity of examining I did not find any such
flagellum, either in living specimens or in stained preparations. I am informed by
Mr Clifford Dobell, however, that he has observed an accessory flagellum—much as
in Monas—in forms otherwise indistinguishable from Bicoeca lacustris James-Clark, and
that he believes that forms with two anterior flagella undoubtedly exist. Stained pre-
parations of three species of Bicoeca by von Prowazek (1903), Reynolds (1927) and
myself (see p. 459) show no trace of a second anterior flagellum. The situation
is rendered all the more confusing by the fact that when Kent and Stokes published
their descriptions the anchoring filament was not recognized as a flagellum, and the
two flagella of the free-swimming form were identified by Kent with the two anterior
flagella of the sessile form. Yet since the posterior anchoring filament is undoubtedly
a flagellum, the free-swimming form should have three flagella, if indeed there are

two anterior flagella; but this has never been described. I would suggest that a
second, rudimentary, anterior flagellum may sometimes be formed before division,
at a time when the flagellate is still active, before it becomes rounded off (see
p. 460).
