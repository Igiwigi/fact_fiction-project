I shall indicate a few alternative conceptions of causality, which are applicable in
quantum theory in the absence of classical causality. If understood classically, causality is an
ontological category, part of reality. It relates to the behaviour of physical systems whose evolution
is defined by the fact that the state of a given system (as idealized by a given theory or model) is
determined at all moments of time by its state at a particular moment of time, indeed at any given
moment of time. This concept is in accord with Kantâ€™s principle of causality cited above and has
been commonly used since, which states that, if an event takes place, it has a determinable cause
or set of causes of which this event is an effect. It is also commonly (although not universally)
assumed that the cause must be antecedent to, or at least simultaneous with, the effect.
