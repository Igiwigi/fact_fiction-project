342 THE RESISTANCE AND ELECTROMOTIVE FORCES OF THE ELECTRIC ARC

these frequencies, even supposing the other arms of the bridge quite free from self-
induction and capacity. This explains the fact that only a minimum in the sound is
obtainable, and not absolute silence.

The conclusion to be drawn from this experiment is that in any case where the
P.D. due to the polarisation of the electrodes cannot be made very small compared
with the ohmic drop along the liquid whose resistance is being measured, and where
the errors due to the polarisation cannot be eliminated by taking two or more tests,
then it must not be assumed without proof that the use of alternating currents at
ordinary frequencies of a few hundred periods per second eliminates the possibility of
errors due to polarisation, For in the case of sulphuric acid used above, the
polarisation can vary as rapidly as the resistance of the cored are.
