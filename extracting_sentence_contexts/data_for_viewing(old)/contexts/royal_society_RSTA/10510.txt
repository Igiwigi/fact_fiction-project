An interesting subject for future inquiry would be as to whether the flash
spectrum undergoes any modifications such as an increase or decrease of depth of the
layer or changes in the intensity of the enhanced lines at different epochs in the sun-
spot period. If the chromosphere is really of an eruptive character one might
expect, at times of maximum spot activity, when also the metallic eruptions are most
frequent, that the flash spectrum region would extend to greater altitudes in the
chromosphere and that the enhanced lines would be relatively brighter than during
the quiet periods of minimum.

The evidence so far obtained is, it is true, against any marked changes occurring.
I have compared the spectrum obtained by SHAcKLETON in 1896 with those herein
discussed and with others obtained in 1898 and 1901, but without detecting any
certain changes in the intensities of the lines. The flash appears, in fact, to be of as
constant and unchanging a character as is the Fraunhofer spectrum, which is only
what would naturally be expected, seeing that it appears to be in the main the
reversal of that spectrum.

Summary of Conclusions.

In a general way the conclusions arrived at from the discussion of the spectra
obtained in 1898 are amply confirmed and extended by the present results.

It is now shown that every strong dark line of the solar spectrum exceeding
Row tanvâ€™s intensity 7 is found in these spectra as a bright line; and the great
