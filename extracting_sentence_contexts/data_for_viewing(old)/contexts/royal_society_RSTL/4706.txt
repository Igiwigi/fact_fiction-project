But there is in the present case a relation independent of the quantities a, &c., viz. we
have (&, Þ, /L1, 1 4)=0, (&, 3, 7 Ls Yo, 22) =0, (&, B, ys, Ys, 2.) =0, and thence elimi-
nating the coefficients («, 3, y), we find

By forming the powers and products of the second degree a*, ab, &c., we obtain 55
equations between the symmetric functions of the second degree in each set of roots.
But we have V*=0=a symmetric function of the roots, and thus the entire number of
linear relations is 56, and this is in fact the number of the symmetric functions of the
-8econd degree in each set. I use for shortness the 8ign S to denote the 8am of the
