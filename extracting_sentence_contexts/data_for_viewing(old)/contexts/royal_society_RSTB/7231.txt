beginning of the season may go out of this crop later on owing to drought or excessive rainfall
or through damage by pests. The actual area under jute thus fluctuates from day to day.
Usually the area would increase up to a maximum fairly early in the crop season and then

gradually decrease until the crop is actually harvested. The official estimate refers to the

end of the season, while the sample census being spread over the whole season may be con-
sidered to be roughly centred at the middle of the season. On this view the official estimate
should be somewhat lower than the sample value, and this is found to be true. In fact the
revised official estimate itself showed a decrease of about 90,000 acres as.compared to the
preliminary official estimate which was published earlier and was based on the first enumera-
tion made during the earlier part of the season. Halving the difference, 45,000 acres or
about 3 % of the total area is obtained as a rough estimate of the average physical shrinkage
between the middle and the end of the season. This suggests that there exists a residual
physical uncertainty of something of the order of say 3%, so that the accuracy attained in
1941 was fully adequate, and that attempts to go beyond this would serve no useful purpose.

304. To sum up, it was found that, although full statistical control was not established
and recording mistakes were not completely eliminated, the accuracy of the sample survey
attained in 1941 was sufficient for all practical purposes. The internal precision was high
and of the order of 1 %; the margin of error on the basis of comparison with an external and
