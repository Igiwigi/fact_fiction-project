In such exceptional cases as that recorded (y of the table), in which the minimal
pressure is not reached for 45 to 50 seconds, the earlier part of the fall is retarded
relatively to the later, and there is a tendency for the minimal pressure to be main-
tained for some 10 to 15 seconds, and for the succeeding rise to be slow.

The pressure is, however, in only a very small proportion of cases, long maintained
at its lowest, even when the return to or towards the normal is slow. A slight upward
tendency is recorded within a comparatively few seconds of the time at which the
minimum was reached. .

In the first administration of amyl nitrite this maintenance of minimal depression is
particularly short ; it is, in fact, no sooner touched than in from 5 to 8 seconds the rise
commences. A more prolonged depression at the lowest point, or within two or thre
millims, of it, is observable when the nitrite has been given repeatedly, and this 18
especially the case when the administrations succeed one another rapidly. This pol

and the relatively long depression at or about the minimum will be tanta
later on.

The rise of pressure may vary in speed even when the dose of nitrite remains equal.
Amongst the circumstances which favour a rapid rise areâ€”
