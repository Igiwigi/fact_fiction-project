IV. On the Transfer of certain of the constituent Parts of Bodies
by the Action of Electricity.

M. GavTutroT has stated,* that in a-single Garvanic
circle of zinc, silver, and water, in an active State, the oxide
of zinc. formed is attracted 'by the silver;+- and M: M.
HisiNGER and BeRzEL1vs detail an account of an experiment,
in which solution of muriate of lime being placed in the positive
part of a siphon, electrified by wires from a Vorrtaic pile,
and distilled water in the negative part, lime appeared in the
distilled water. l

'These facts rendered it probable, that the saline elements
evolved in decompoxitions by electricity were capable of being
transferred from one electrified surface to another, according
to their usual order of arrangement; but to demonstrate this
clearly, new researches were wanting.

I connected one of the cups of sulphate' of lime,-mentioned
page 13, with a cup of agate by asbestus; and, filling them with
purified water, made the platina wire in the cup of sulphate of
lime transmit theelectricity from a power of 100; a wire in the
agate' cup received it. In about four hours a strong solution of
lime was found in the agate cup, and sulphuric acid in the. cup
of sulphate of lime. By reversing the order, and carrying on
