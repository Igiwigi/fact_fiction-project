Evidence of a like kind is afforded by anatomical researches. In the first place, Scuutrze found that after damage to the cervical enlargement
a comma-shaped area of descending degeneration occurred in the posterior columns,
Bareacct found also after a transverse lesion of the cord that scattered descending
degeneration could be found throughout the whole breadth of the posterior column. The most important anatomical fact, however, is the well-known discovery by
Ramon-y-Casat, confirmed by KériKer, Rerzrus, and Gore, that the posterior
root fibres divide almost immediately upon their entrance into the cord into two main
branches, one ascending and one descending. I venture to provisionally suggest
that the ascending branch is, perhaps, chiefly concerned with sensory (7.e., cerebral)

impulses, and the lower branch with local sensori-motor reflex actions,

Tt has also been shown in the horse that there is a difference in level between the
