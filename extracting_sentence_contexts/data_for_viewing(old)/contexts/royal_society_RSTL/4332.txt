up to the opening, and even extending it beyond the body of the animal. Muscles
also for the purpose of opening the valve (Plate XXXIV. fig. 14 EF), very similar to
those for the same purpose in the female, and the bands which bring the penis forward,
clearly show it to be an extrusory organ, and form a complete male apparatus.

The sperm-bag evidently contains active spermatozoa (Plate XXXIV.fig. 13), having
an oval flattened body (of a high refracting power), and a caudal appendage, that,
while in the sac, is in constant vibratile movement; they are s0mewhat larger than,
and of the same general form as, human spermatozoa.

I myself have never observed any action beyond the extrusion of the penis, but
my friend Mr. BriG6nTweELL has observed in seven different instances the direct copula-
tion of the*two sexes. The following quotation from his notice of the fact in the
Annals of Natural History for September 1848, clearly demonstrates this important
circumstance.

* Observations as to the Union between the Sexes.

* June 15th.—Placed a male and six females in a small glass trough by themselves,
and two males and about thirty females in a large trough.

* June 16th, between 7 and 8 a.M.—On examining the small trough observed that
the male on approaching one of the females attached himself* to its side by the sper-
matozoid projection, and remained $0 attached from twenty to thirty seconds. The
same male acted precisely in the same manner with four other females. These five
