AT indirectly measured on the investigated PBLZST thin films is depicted in figure 8a—-d: AT is
found to increase linearly with temperature, T. No phase transition occurs within the studied
temperature range, at which a peak on the AT-T curve should be expected. This is not in
agreement with the PBLZST ceramics phase diagram, which indicates that a field-induced
paraelectric-ferroelectric phase transition is observed between 40 and 50°C for 0 < E <30kVm"!,



to which the large E applied to the studied thin films and the effect of substrate constraint may
have contributed. Furthermore, figure 9 shows that ECE increases with increasing film thickness.
This may be explained by considering that, by increasing the film thickness, the effect of the
substrate constraint throughout the film diminishes. This corroborates the findings of previous
works reporting that ECE is, in fact, strongly affected by a misfit-strain effect, which can, in turn,
be tailored by adjusting the film thickness [18-21].

4. Conclusion

Full-perovskite PBLZST thin films were fabricated by a sol-gel method. These films were
characterized by tetragonal and rhombohedral phases, as opposed to the tetragonal phase
observed in PBLZST ceramic. The fraction of tetragonal and rhombohedral grains was found to
be thickness-dependent, which was duly explained within the framework of the ‘two-layered
model’, according to which a rhombohedral layer develops at the bottom of the film. This is
caused by the strong effect of misfit strain between the film and the substrate and the strain-
free tetragonal PBLZST grains located at the film surface. The two-layered structure of PBLZST
thin films resulted in film dependence of the paraelectric—antiferroelectric phase transition
