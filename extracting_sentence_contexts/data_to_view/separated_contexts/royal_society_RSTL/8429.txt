The range of our best horns on June 10
was 82 miles. The guns at this distance were very feeble. 'That the loudness of the
sound depends on the shape of the gun was proved by the fact that thus far the howitzer,
with a 3-lb. charge, proved more effective than the other guns. In the axis of the horns
the sound manifests its greatest strength, falling sensibly off as the angular distance
from the axis is augmented. Now the whistles have no such axes, but send their
s0und-waves with equal strength in all directions.
