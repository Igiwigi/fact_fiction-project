This red s0lution
however 80on decomposes, a brownish precipitate falling, and the yellow colour due
to a prusside being seen in the solution. If the suIphide originally employed con-
tained sulphuretted hydrogen, a soluble prussian blue is also found in the liquid. During these changes, ammonia, hydrocyanic acid, and a gas possessing the proper-
ties of nitrogen are given off, In fact, on mixing the solutions of sulphide and nitro-
prusside, it is difficult, even by keeping the solutions quite cold, to prevent the form-
ation of a little ammonia and escape of nitrogen. 'The s0lution of the purple com-
pound in water decomposes eyen under the air-pump, depositing the brown precipi-
tate, and it does 80 immediately when it is boiled. When the solution is filtered from the brown precipitate, the addition. of alcohol
separates ferrocyanide of sodium. The alcoholic filtrate strikes a blood-red colour
with a persalt of iron, and with sulphuric acid evolves nitric oxide, whieh is immedi-
ately rendered sensible by a protosalt of iron, a nitrite being thus shown to be in
solution.
