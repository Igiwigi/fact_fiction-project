It is a
curious fact, that, with the exception of the lateral incision,
and immersion into a saline solution mentioned by that histo-
rian, we find no confirmatory evidence of the other steps of
the supposed processes of embalming detailed by him in any
of the various mummies that have hitherto been examined. And in the one now submitted to the inspection of the So-
ciety, by far the most perfect that has yet been publicly
described, we have none of the characteristic features of the
three several modes of embalming which we are told were fol-
lowed by the ancient Egyptians; while, on the other hand,
some of 'the lesser features of each process are strikingly
apparent. We have, in fact, the presence of that which
Heroporus asserted was invariably removed in the better


Egyptian mummies. 313

prepared mummies, and some of those- parts are absent, on
the other hand, which he stated never to have been touched
in the inferior class of those singular preparations, These
facts will be duly valued by the scholar, and the commen-
tators of that historian ; and the explanation now given of
the real mode of mummifying, will enable the lexicographer
to advance with confidence, that the name mummy was given
to such preparations from the circumstance of waz (mum in
the Cophtic language), being the really preservative ingre-
dient employed in their preparation. I have had occasion in the course of this paper to observe,
that as by carefully taking into consideration the various
facts which presented themselves during the examination of
our mummy, it was natural to suppose, that the mode in
which it had been prepared would be discovered ; 80 would
that discovery be confirmed if, by acting on those facts, some-
thing resembling a mummy- could be produced ; and in the
specimens which will be submitted to the members after.
