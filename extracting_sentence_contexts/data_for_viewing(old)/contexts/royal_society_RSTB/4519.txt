recorded, we should judge that our efforts to prevent undue rise of temperature had
been tolerably successful, though it is quite possible that in the first of these experi-
ments the distinct fall in the alveolar CO, pressure after the work is dependent more
on rise of temperature than on anything else, as no fan was used.

The lactic acid theory and temperature changes therefore appear inadequate to
explain the rise of the respiratory quotient during the work in Douauas’s case in this
series of experiments, and, as we have pointed out above, a slight “direct” action of
deficiency of oxygen on the respiratory centre, if limited to the period of work, would
not be appreciable in a record of the total respiratory exchange, though it might
become evident from a consideration of the volume of air breathed during the work
and the prevailing alveolar CO, pressure. We suggest, therefore, that this alteration
is, in the main at least, due to the fact that the energy output during the work
involves the metabolism of a greater proportion of carbohydrate to fat than is the case
during rest.

This idea is strengthened by the earlier experiments on Douenas during walking
exercise,* in which it was shown that rise of respiratory quotient could be detected at
rates of exercise so low as to demand only double the resting metabolism, though the
rise became greater as the rate of walking and the total metabolism increased, and
that moderate prolongation of the exercise did not lead to any striking alteration of
the respiratory quotient. It was tentatively suggested on these grounds, as well as
on the fact that examination of the alveolar air gave no indication of a persistent
lowered threshold value of CO, unless the pace of walking was very fast, that the
most probable explanation lay in the inereased proportion of carbohydrate to fat
