Of course, as has long been recognized (Gates, 1923),
the homology of the chromosomes in a pair cannot be so strict in the catenated
Oenothera as in other genera, and it is probable that the homology of the chromosomes
in some pairs is closer than in others. In these forms, where there is no evidence of
laterally paired ends, it is probable that the homologies of the various pairs are not
very close, i.e., the homologous chromosome ends may be very short, too short for
side-by-side pairing. These conclusions appear to be supported by the fact that
breaks in the chain not infrequently occur between chromosomes which are regarded
as homologues. There is a period in first metaphase when the connections between chromosomes
are stretched to the utmost. Then the forces applied at the spindle fibre attachment
to the middle of each V-shaped chromosome increase to the point of breaking these
connections.
