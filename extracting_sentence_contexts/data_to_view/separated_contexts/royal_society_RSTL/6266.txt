ARCHDEACON PRATT ON THE INDIAN ARC OF MERIDIAN. 589

— From this it follows, that the length of the arc lying between its two extremities will
be sensibly the same, whether it coincide with the mean ellipse in curyature, or with
any of the other ellipses enumerated in ($ 2. Of course, on determining the geodetic

S the amplitude will come out differently for these different ellipses, although s is the
S 8ame. But the fact, that the length of the arc is the same whatever the curvature of

S calculated from the length measured by the Survey, by means of the above formula
= applied to the mean ellipse, will be the amplitude corresponding to the mean ellipse,
3 however much the actual arc differs from the mean ellipse owing to geological or other
'Zeauses. Hence the deflection of the plumb-line in India from the normal to the mean
Z ellipse can in no degree be attributed to the possible or probable circumstance of the
Z curvature of the arc differing from the mean ellipse, as it may differ materially from it
Swithout producing this effect.

'Z I may illustrate this still further by finding what amount of deviation in the curvature
