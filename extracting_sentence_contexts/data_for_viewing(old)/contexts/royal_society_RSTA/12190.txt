hood of the system in which the currents are induced : these would be equivalent
regards the magnitudes of induced currents, but not as regards the distribution
induced electric force.

This state of things would not be inconsistent with general principles. The electri
influence arising from a disturbance of one system is propagated elastically to oth
systems across the intervening medium, the propagation being nearly instantaneo
without showing any sensible trace of the disturbance during its transit through t
medium, and this on account of the high elasticity and consequent great velocity
propagation. The magnetic field is a residual effect of this propagation ; that field is
sufficient to represent the aggregate features of the result in cases in which the curre
is mostly conducted, but it need not represent the features of the propagation
detail. There are in fact cases in which induction takes place across a space in whiel
there is at no time any sensible electric or magnetic force at all: for example t
starting of a current in a ring electro-magnet induces in this way a current in an
outside cireuit which is eta with the ring: the elastic propagation here leaves ne
trace in the form of motion of the wether or magnetic force.

111. When the velocity of electric propagation may be taken as indefinitely great
compared with the velocities of the conductors in the field, the phenomena of induced
currents will depend only on the relative motion of the inducing and induced systems;
thus we may simplify the conditions by taking the induced system at rest subject t
the electric influences sent out from an inducing system in motion and otherwise
changing. Now in this simpler case the electric intensity consists of two parts, one
of them required to keep the current going against the viscous resistance of the
