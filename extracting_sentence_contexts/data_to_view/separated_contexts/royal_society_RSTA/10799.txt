GODFREY ON THE APPLICATION OF FOURIER’S

Accordingly the distribution of energy in the spectrum given by the succession of

such pulses is that shown in the curve

If we take the particles of the cathode stream to be at least as great as molecules,
2d, the thickness of pulse, is small compared with the wave-length of visible light
(see THomson’s paper); d/ky may be taken as yolg9, where A, is the wave-length of
yellow light, say. In the scale of fig. 1 27/A) is very near to 0. It appears that long
waves have the greatest amplitude; practically the same amplitude is maintained
onwards through the visible spectrum, and in fact till we approach to wave-lengths
comparable with the diameter of the molecules.

§ 33. The measure with which we are concerned, however, is not amplitude, but
integral energy through ranges of wave-length. Considering this, we see at once
that the short waves are all-important.
