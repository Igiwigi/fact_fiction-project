2°32. The double example and exact difference give weight to the suggestion.

m= 10,11. Similarly the modified ¢ makes exact agreement, and they enter in a corresponding way
and in both series.

402 DR. W. M. HICKS: A CRITICAL STUDY OF SPECTRAL SERIES,

We can now use this series to test the question as to the existence of parallel
series depending on (+2é,) D(). This does not mean that the sequences must be the
same in each. In fact it is to be expected that there may be a concomitant change
in them also, but they can only differ by a few multiples of the oun. The important
point to notice is that for large values of m, the effects of such differences become
negligible and the observed separations from the standard D should approximate to
+21°25, which is that due to 26, on the limit. It will not be necessary to go into
such a full discussion as in the standard series with D (0), except for the first three
sets, where the evidence for changed sequence terms with displaced limits is conclusive
and important. The lists and sounders are given in the same table as for the
standard series, in the first and third columns respectively. The considerations adduced
enable us to feel that the ground is safe in recognising that parallel series depending
on displacements on the limit D(«)=S() really exist. The evidence does not
depend on a single numerical coincidence of a line, or of a line found by sounding, but
on the fact that these numerical coincidences appear for so many sounding links in
