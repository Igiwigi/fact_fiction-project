Similar to how Maxwell’s electrodynamics can be derived from local gauge invariance,
Einstein’s general relativity can be derived from symmetry under local—that is, space-time
dependent—Lorentz transformations. However, that understanding of general relativity—and
of electrodynamics—reverses the historical order of discovery. Einstein, guided by experimental
facts (equivalence principle, Newtonian limit) arrived at general relativity through a mixture of
geometrical ideas and inspired intuition [6]. Only later did Weyl [7] clarify and emphasize the
local symmetry aspect, in an attempt to understand both gravity and electrodynamics ona similar
footing. (See below.)

On the other hand, Yang & Mills [8], in their pioneering attempt to generalize Maxwell
electrodynamics, consciously started from local symmetry. They showed how one could construct
interesting relativistic field theories accommodating more complicated gauge transformations,
where the parameter A(x) is not simply a numerical function, but a function taking values in a
compact group.
