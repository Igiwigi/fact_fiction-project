This is possibly due to either of two
causes or perhaps both; first, the larvae may be susceptible to ‘water poisoning’; secondly,
the high vapour pressure may itself exercise a harmful effect on them. Water poisoning,
as explained by Buxton (1932, p. 298), is either due to the inability of larvae to lose water
by evaporation in the saturated air (which prevents regulation of temperature by evapora-
tion), or the larvae may be actually gaining water of metabolism faster than they can
dispose of it. The fact that intrinsic injurious effect of high humidities is only perceptible
in combination with high temperatures is in favour of the latter assumption. XI. Errects OF TEMPERATURE ON THE GROWTH OF FLEA LARVAE AND PUPAE

I desired to find out the effect of a temperature on the resting larvae and pupae within
cocoons.
