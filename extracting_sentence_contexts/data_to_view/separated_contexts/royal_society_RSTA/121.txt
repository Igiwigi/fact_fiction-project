It follows just
as in the last paragraph that there are an infinity of points of A in Ky. This proves that the
conclusion (b) of theorem 4 is valid in the present case. The conclusion (c) of theorem 4 may be established by a very similar argument, using the
fact that, if K is fully reducible, there is a bounded star body K’ contained in K such that
A(K’) = A(K) and such that every lattice, which has determinant A<A(K) and which has
no point other than O strictly inside XK’, is necessarily a critical lattice of K.

Corotiary. If d(A) <A(K), then either A has an infinity of points in the interior of K or A has
a point other than O in every core of K.

We conclude this section by applying the corollary to the body K defined by (48).
