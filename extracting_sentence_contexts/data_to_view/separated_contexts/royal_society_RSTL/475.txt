In the Appendix to the Arithmetica Universalis,
P. 200. 219. &c, NEwToON, with great clearness and force of
argument, has shewn the distinction to be made between the
order of classing curves, analytically considered, that is, defined

but the demonstration of the latter theorem is not, it appears to me, to be reckoned in
the number of strict demonstrations, The only objection against the demonstration of
the very learned and ingenious author of the Calcul des Derivations, is, that it is rather
indirect, and blended with geometrical expressions and formulas,

by equations, and the order of classing them, considered as
generated by description, Moreover, he animadverts on the
custom of confounding the two sciences of algebra and geo-
metry;* and, if any authority is attached to his assertion, that
\the two sciences ought not to. be confounded together, the
separation of geometry‚Äù from algebra will thereby be equally
urged as the separation of algebra from geometry. And it can-
not be said with greater truth, that the simplicity of geometry
is vitiated with algebraic equations, than that the simplicity of
analysis is vitiated with geometrical forms and expressions. In
fact, each science ought to be kept distinct; and be made to
derive its riches from its proper sources. XXV. It will not demand much meditation to be assured of
this truth, that, in any mathematical investigation, the geome-
trical method, properly so called, is not essentially or absolutely
necessary.
