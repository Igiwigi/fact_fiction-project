2. Methods

(a) Structured illumination microscopy with two-dimensional hexagonal illumination
patterns

Our SIM methodology, hexSIM, employs two-dimensional hexagonal illumination patterns for
improving lateral resolution. This is illustrated for a system with epi-illumination: by focusing
three mutually coherent beams to the pupil plane of the illumination objective lens (figure 1a), a
hexagonal intensity illumination pattern like that illustrated in figure 1b is formed at the sample
plane. Also shown in figure 1a are the seven spatial frequency components in the illumination
intensity pattern plotted again relative to the objective pupil. It can be seen here that when the
illuminating beams are positioned at the edge of the pupil (the coherent cut-off) then the spatial
frequency is only at a factor of /3 larger than the coherent cut-off. Combined with the fact that
the incoherent cut-off spatial frequency seen when imaging the light back through the objective is
twice the coherent one, this is what results in a limit of 1 + 3/2 = 1.87 improvement in resolution
in epi-illumination.

Unmixing the seven spatial frequency components generated by this type of illumination
pattern requires only seven raw images illuminated with seven appropriately phase-shifted
patterns (see electronic supplementary material, S1 for a detailed mathematical description), two
