‘

distal sides of the ganglion, they established reason for believing that the impulses
which affected respiration were delayed in transmission through the ganglion to the
extent of ‘036 second. As Gap and JosEpH point out, these experiments are open to
the criticism that the summation of subminimal stimuli may be an important factor
in producing the result.

ON THE MAMMALIAN NERVOUS SYSTEM. 483

C. The conditions under which the functional activity of the nerve centres of the
spinal cord, as indicated by muscular contraction, is evoked necessarily form the
major part of the facts at our disposal.
= These conditions may be arranged as follows :—

Ai(1.) Adjuvants—Warmth. Preliminary influence of cold. After effects of section
& spinal cord* a little distance above the nerve centre. Some drugs, ag.,
chnia, &c.
St (2.) Depressants.—Prolonged fall of temperature. Shock after division of the spinal
@rd (greater in proportion to proximity of section to nerve centre).t Anzmia.
Narcotic drugs (anesthetics, &c.).
23.) Delay.—A series of measurements have been taken of the time lost during the
passage of a nerve impulse from one posterior root through a spinal nerve centre to
the corresponding motor nerve of the same side. This delay, or time-loss, has been
&timated by the majority of observers{ to be about ‘01 in the Frog. (EXNER, in
