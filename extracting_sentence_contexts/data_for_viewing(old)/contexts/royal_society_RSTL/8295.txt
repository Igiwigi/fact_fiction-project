Entact of lines with curyes and surfaces. The coordinates of a point on a conic are
pressed in terms of a single parameter, those of a point on a quadric by two para-
eters. To determine the intersection with a given surface we have an equation in the

meter or parameters, and the conditions of contact ere expressed in terms of the
Fefficients of that equation. The special case of the intersection of a quadric with a
cubic surface is treated by the method of representation on a plane.

* These results constitute the additions.

T [Note by W. Seormswoops.—In the Memoir quoted by Professor CLrvyonp, it was stated that the number
of conics pazzing through a given axis and having six-pointic contact with a surface at a given point is ten.
In making this statement I overlooked the fact that, in order to put in evidence that a certain quantity was a
tactor of the equation which determines the positions of the planes of the conics, the equation was multiplied
by a quantity D which is a linear function of the position. Tn reckoning the degree of the equation this factor
aust of course be discarded. The degree is consequently less by unity than that stated in the Memoir; viz.
it is 9, as proyed by Professor Crayeonv,—TJuly 3, 1873.]
