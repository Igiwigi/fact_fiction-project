fess, perplex me exceedingly. The first is, that the current
was felt, apparently in its full strength, on the fourth day af-
ter the commencement of the gale ; which began at south,
then changed suddenly to the west and WSW, and after-

the 48th and goth degrees of latitude, and, no doubt, ex-

gale: the fourth day, preceding, there had been strong gales
at SW ; and the five days preceding that, there had been
chiefly light winds at west. According to this state of facts,
we can only suppose that the current originated from a vast

We are not to consider the water of this current, as having
made the circuit of the Bay of Biscay ; but as the collective
