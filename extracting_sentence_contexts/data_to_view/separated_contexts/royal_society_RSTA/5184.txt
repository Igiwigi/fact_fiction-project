The term is extremely small, and is distinct fro1
the direct effect of the motion of the ether (§ 79), which is irrotational ; it leads t
an acceleration of one kind of circularly polarized light, and a retardation of the othe
kind, which are of equal amounts. It was this phenomenon of magneto-optic rotation that gave the clue to MaxweEtn'
theory of the electric field. As has recently been remarked by various authors,t thi
deduction from it, that magnetic force must be a rotation of the luminiferous medium
is too narrow an interpretation of the facts; the identification of magnetic force witl
rotation has however hitherto been retained as an essential part of most theories 0
the eether. 84. It is to be observed that the magneto-optic terms in the energy of the medi
do not depend essentially on any averaging of the effect of molecular discreteness,
the same way as dispersive terms or structural rotatory terms.
