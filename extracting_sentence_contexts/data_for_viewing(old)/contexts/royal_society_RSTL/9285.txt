every cabbage yielding ten or a dozen specimens. [Ie adds that he did not observe
whether it climbs to the inflorescence in sunny weather.

Mr. A. W. Bennett, Proc. Linn. Soc. 1874, xxxix., has described the pollen
of Pringlea as differing from that of nearly all other Crucifers in being much smaller
and perfectly spherical, instead of ellipsoid with three furrows. This he considers
to be a striking confirmation of my suggestion that the plant is wind-fertilized, and
which is further confirmed by the total absence of hairs on the style.

Moseley found one plant with 28 flower-stalks, three of the one season growth,
the others appearing to belong to eight preceding seasons,

It is a remarkable fact that all attempts to grow this plant in England, Scotland,
and Treland have failed; the young plants, after attaining a height of a few inches
and a good crown of leaves, have invariably suceumbed to the combined effects of
summer's heat, and the attacks of the common parasite fungus, Cyslopus candidus,
which infests the Capsella Bursa-pastoris. Some few, out of many hundreds,
sown at different seasons and under very yaried conditions, survived one winter, but
perished in the following summer.
