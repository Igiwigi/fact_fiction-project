The dis
covery of the tetrethylated ammonium-bases had also opened a new field of research, m
which the corresponding terms of the antimony- and arsenic-series were rapidly brought
to light. Tt was indeed possible to predict with certainty, that an appropriately elected
method would lead to the production of the analogous derivatives of phosphoretted
hydrogen. The time for resuming the study of the phosphorus-bases had in fact
arrived. We have been engaged for a considerable time in the investigation of this subject,
and now beg to offer to the Royal Society in the following pages an account of our
experiments. . In the first place, we have endeavoured to obtain the bases corresponding to phos
phoretted hydrogen, by a method analogous to that followed by M.
