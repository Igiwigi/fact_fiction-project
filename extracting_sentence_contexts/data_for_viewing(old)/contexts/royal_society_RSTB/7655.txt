the foramen ovale and then divides into two, the smaller branch forming the middle
meningeal artery, and the larger running forwards to join one of the more posterior
vessels of the arteria anastomotica within the cavernous sinus (figure 13). The middle
meningeal artery gives rise to a vessel which passes to the middle ear accompanying the
superficial petrosal nerves. In one specimen the middle meningeal artery was larger than
the continuation of the ramus anastomoticus.

The internal carotid artery

The remains of an internal carotid artery was found in dissected preparations as a fine
strand of fibrous tissue, extending from the common carotid artery to the tympanic bulla.
In no specimen, however, could the patency of the vessel be demonstrated by the use of
an injection mass. This may be due to the fact that the youngest cat examined was about
1 month old.

The ascending pharyngeal artery

This artery generally arises from the occipital artery near its origin from the external
carotid artery. After passing over the inferior surface of the tympanic bulla, it enters the
cranium through the foramen lacerum medium (foramen lacerum of man) and courses
through the cavernous sinus to join the arteria anastomotica at the point where this passes
through the dura (figures 1, 15). It seems probable that the intracranial portion of the
ascending pharyngeal artery is a persisting segment of the internal carotid artery.
