megafaunal biomass are decoupled from surface production and therefore that carbon flux
must be controlled to a first order by biological pump efficiency—perhaps mediated by bloom
composition, dynamics or ice-edge physics [31].

We may, therefore, synthesize these findings to suggest that a history of frequent fast-sinking
diatom blooms justifies greater megafaunal biomass in northern sites, and that the Atlantification
of these waters, and a switch to Phaeocystis predominance, will result in a poorer nourishment of
the benthos and a shift in the long term to lower megafaunal biomass. We must also consider that,
during mid and late summer, phytoplankton blooms in the BS descend toward the nutricline to
form subsurface chlorophyll maxima (SCMs) [56], meaning some production is missed by remote-
sensing approaches. In this study, this may have the effect of giving us the false impression that
phytoplankton communities north of the PF are resistant to environmental change (figure 5),
when communities residing at depth here may, in fact, be changing. As there is currently much
debate in the literature as to the effects of neglecting the SCM on production estimates (e.g.
[57-59]), Arctic shelf SCMs clearly warrant further investigation.

(c) Limitations to our experimental bio-optical algorithm

Overall, much greater confidence can be invested in the detection of coccolithophore blooms,
which are clearly defined by the characteristic light-scattering properties of their shed coccoliths.
Our approach is also necessarily limited by the available spectral resolution of the MODIS-Aqua
sensor and by the underlying assumption in our bio-optical algorithm’s construction that CDOM
is invariant. This assumption is fair in the BS, where CDOM absorption remains constant even
across major hydrographic features [60], but is not true outside of the BS, limiting the wider
