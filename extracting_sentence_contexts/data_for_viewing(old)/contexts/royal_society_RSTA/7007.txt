while crossing the edge of the continental shelf, It should be noticed that the vertical scale
is exaggerated approximately four times.

In some places where the echoes were doubtful the profile has been dotted. These weak
echoes are probably due to considerable variations in depth within the area of the bottom
illuminated by the sound beam. They usually occur near the bottom of a valley. The fact that
many of these appear to be V-shaped is because echoes are received from both sides of such
a depression. For instance, if soundings were made while steaming over a valley of the
cross-section shown in figure 5a, a record as shown in figure 55 would be obtained. It is
