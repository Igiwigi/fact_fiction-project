lysis are not yet reduced to a form available for determining the nature of an element
of this group in 80 minute an amount. That it is not zirconium the evidence of 80
accurate an experimentalist as Mr. S0RBY may be taken to prove ; that it is titanium seems
scarcely compatible with the comparative experiments I made with it and with titanium
chloride. It is certain, however, that Osbornite consists of calcium, and what may be
provisionally termed a titanoid element, possibly titanium itself, with a trace of iron
and combined with sulphur in some peculiarly stable form. This form can hardly be
that of a combination of the sulphides of the metals merely ; one cannot well conceive
8uch a compound resisting the action of acids. The sulphides of the metals of this
class, however, are little known; while those of calcium associated with oxygen in the
form of what are termed oxysulphides need also further investigation.

The fact of the Osbornite crystals being met with occasionally in the variety of augite,
which will be presently described, as an ingredient of this meteorite, and which is for
the most part confined to that nodule of the meteorite in which the Oldhamite occurs,
suggested a search in that silicate for an oxide corresponding to what had been found in
the Osbornite. The precipitates thrown down by ammonia from the acid solution of
the bases in the different analyses of that augite were therefore brought together and

examined. They contained some ferric oxide; but this was associated with a small
amount of a colourless oxide entirely insoluble in potash, which, when tried by the tests
that had been employed with the Osbornite precipitate, gave exactly the same results as
these had given. The dichroism of this augite is yery marked ; and on looking through
one of its faces (the face 0 1 0) a tint (like that of the bluish anatase from Brazil) is seen
