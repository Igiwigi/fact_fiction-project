its reciprocal (essentially our 8, equation (2.2)). We have found it interesting to endorse as the
basic expansion the reciprocal-activation—reciprocal-temperature relationship [27], for which we
can provide a formal mathematical justification by extending the so-called Tolman theorem [15],
following the quantum mechanical formulation in [19]. Tolman’s function Ea, when written as
the logarithmic derivative of the rate constants with respect to 6 (equation (2.3)), is indeed akin
to the concept of an activation energy, in the sense that it represents a measure of an energetic
obstacle to the progress of the reaction; therefore, its reciprocal can be interpreted as a measure
of the propensity for the reaction to proceed and defined as the specific transitivity [20] of the
process:
1

y(b)= En (2.4)
Our notation emphasizes the fact that in general the transitivity may not be constant but may
take a gamma of values: it is assumed to be a smooth function of f in a sufficiently ample range
of temperature, not including abrupt changes, e.g. in the mechanism or in the phases of reactants:
in this range it will admit a Laurent expansion in a neighbourhood around a reference value
denoted as Bo:

y(B)= Y> CalB - Bo)", (25)

n=—0o

where the coefficients C,, will contain n-order derivatives of y(S) with respect to 6 and taken
at Bo. The theory of chemical reaction kinetics is focused on the task of providing a set of such
coefficients to connect to the experiment on k(T) via equations ((2.1)-(2.4)).
