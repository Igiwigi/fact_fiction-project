Instead of
moving the helix round the needle, we may carry the needle into different positions
as regards the helix, and then fig. 20 will represent the result. A Fig. 20.

2993. As an expression of the facts for use in applying them to Â© _
the explanation and illustration of natural phenomena, it may be ;
8aid in respect of declination, that the helix being above the needle "
in a plane having dip, and therefore above its magnetic equator, if *
on the east of a needle having north dip, it will send the south or
upper end west, or if on the east of a needle having south dip (being : :
of course then itself inverted (2972.)), it will cause the north or : i [
upperend to pass westward ; seeming to repel the end of the free needle or part of the
line of force nearest to it. In reference to the inclination, it may be said, that the helix
being above the needle, tends to 8end the upper end of the needle or line of force from
it. If the helix is north of the magnetic axis, it will tend to send the upper end of the
needle south ; if it is south, the upper end will go north.
