Technique-—Owing to the fragmentary condition of the remains of the Crustacean
and the entire uncertainty as to where they would most likely be found in the Chert, it
was soon realised that some simpler method than that of preparing ordinary rock sections
would be necessary if excessive labour and expense were to be avoided. The expedient
of examining small, thin flakes or chips of the Chert immersed in oil was therefore tried,
and found to work admirably. The chips are simply struck off with a hammer, the
flattest and thinnest being as a rule selected for examination. When covered with oil
(usually cedar oil or oil of cloves—preferably the latter, as it is less troublesome to use),
the roughness of the surface is obliterated as effectually as if the chips had been ground
and polished. Examination under the microscope can be made with or without a
cover-glass, and as a rule no difficulty is found in using objectives up to ¢ inch (4 mm.).
Even immersion-lenses up to ;4; inch (2 mm.) can be used in many cases if required,
and in fact a certain number of details of the Crustacean to be described were only noticed
in this way. The chips can also, of course, be mounted in balsam if desired, the balsam
naturally having the same effect as the oil in obliterating all traces of surface roughness.
Incidentally, it may be mentioned that both in the work of searching for traces of the
Crustacean and in the elucidation of its structure, the use of a strong light is very helpful,
especially, of course, in the case of chips of any considerable thickness. For this reason
a good artificial illuminant is generally preferable to daylight. In many instances a
100 ¢.p. “ Pointolite ” lamp has been employed with advantage.
