laws determine explicitly who has a right to vote, but whether that vote has influ-
ence or not is determined by governing power structures. Political power affects
whether and how market incomes get redistributed through taxes and transfers.
Institutions around inheritance determine the intergenerational transmission of
resources, which may lead to cumulative effects of inequality over time.

This interplay between individual attributes and the institutional context in
which individuals live echoes important themes in the analysis of inequality by
evolutionary ecologists. In this literature, wealth can be understood to refer to
any resource that can be passed on across generations and that ‘can affect an
individual’s health, well-being and RS [reproductive success]’ [1, p. 190]. In pas-
toral and agricultural societies, material wealth (like livestock, tools and land) is
centrally important. The fact that the material of wealth can be defended and
transferred across generations relatively easily means that inequality is more
likely to persist in such societies. In horticultural and hunter-gatherer societies,
‘wealth’ more often takes the form of social relationships and connections, or
embodied, physical, skills and attributes, which are less reliably protected
and transferred, making inequality less persistent in such societies.

These ‘technological’ differences, however, do not tell the whole story. Inter-
generational transmission of wealth depends on institutions and practices
adopted by a society, not just on the composition of wealth (whether material,
relational or embodied) [2, pp. 686-687]: societies that operate in volatile cli-
matic or other conditions often develop egalitarian institutions and practices,
regardless of the composition of their wealth, as insurance against shocks. In
