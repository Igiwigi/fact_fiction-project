1. Introduction: the discovery of the song system and sex

Gregory F. Ball One of the most the most remarkable discoveries in the history of the study of

nuclei that control the learning and production of birdsong ([1], see [2] for a
review). In the 1970s Nottebohm described, based primarily on studies in canaries
(Serinus canaria), a discrete set of brain nuclei that specifically controlled a complex
learned motor behaviour, birdsong (figure 1, see Nottebohm [3] for a review).

Initially, Nottebohm assumed like most neuroscientists at the time, that this
circuit would be broadly similar in males and females despite the fact that there
were marked differences in song behaviour in canaries (see discussion in Not-
tebohm [4]). He points out that when preparing the canary brain atlas with
Stokes & Leonard [5], he and his colleagues used material from males and
females inter-changeably on the assumption that there would be no sex differ-
ence in overall neural structure [4]. Although the hypothesis was already well
accepted that actions of steroid hormones early in ontogeny could set up endur-
ing sex differences in brain function [6], neural sex differences that had been
described anatomically were only apparent at the cellular level (e.g. quantitative
differences in dendritic spine density) and required a detailed analysis to be
detected (e.g. [7]).

The song system is an unusual circuit in that it is cytoarchitectonically discrete
