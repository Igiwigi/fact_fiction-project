noted that mean precipitation projections also exhibit a scenario dependence in the RCP ensemble
[23], and that the time dimension can be relevant for variables with large inertia (e.g. sea-level
rise [2]). Despite these caveats, the fact that the ESR approach appears to emulate well the
regional responses of extremes for different global temperature levels—almost independently
of the scenario pathway and time frame within the twenty-first century—makes it attractive
for investigating low-emissions scenarios based on existing simulations for higher-emissions
pathways.
