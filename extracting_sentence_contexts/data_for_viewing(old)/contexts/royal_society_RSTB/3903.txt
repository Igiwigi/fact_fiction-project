Fic. 2 (Dog F.V.).—Outline to scale of the angle, sulcus, and S—A node, with four contacts; charts of
curves from the three leads depicted. The curves actually taken for the purpose of constructing this
chart are shown in fig. 12; they were :—

1, S.A.N. lead (a’)-(b') and Lead J7, a’ was first relatively negative. The contacts were
then moved down the sulcus by 1 or more millimetres (a)—().

2. S.A.N, lead (a)-(b) and I.V.C. lead (c)-(d).

3. Lead («)-(c) and Lead JJ.

The chart contains a slight assumption, namely that the upstroke in (a)-(b) and (a)-(c) commences
at the same instant. As a matter of fact, in this instance, the relation was not precisely shown, but
we found that (a’) in (a’)-(b’) became negative 0:0010 second before (a) in (a)-(c). We have
consequently placed the upstroke in leads (a)-(b) and (a)-(c) on the same line.

It will be seen that the culmination in lead (a)-(c) corresponds very accurately with the upstroke
of the intrinsic deflection in lead (c)-(d). Another curious relation is demonstrated in this instance :
the downstroke of the intrinsic deflection in (a)-(c) corresponds to the culmination in (c)-(d). This
we find to be a not infrequent relation, though there may be a difference of several thousandths of a
second between the two points. Evidently the exact relation can only occur if the same potentials are
developed under contacts (a) and (¢).

The charted curves of this and subsequent figures are upon such a scale that a distance equivalent
to our approximate error of measurement is hidden. Ordinates, 1 em. = 3 millivolts ; abscisse,
