In this paper, we review
the literature from various fields that suggest that, under some circumstances,
increased connectedness can decrease cultural diversity and reduce innovation
rates. Incorporating this idea into an agent-based model, we explore the effect
of population fragmentation on cumulative culture and show that, for a given
Subject Areas: population size, there exists an intermediate level of population fragmentation
evolution that maximizes the rate of cumulative cultural evolution. This result is

explained by the fact that fully connected, non-fragmented populations are

able to maintain complex cultural traits but produce insufficient variation
