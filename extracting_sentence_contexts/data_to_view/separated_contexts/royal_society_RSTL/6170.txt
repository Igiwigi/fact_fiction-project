The equation of differences for an equation of any order may be found by the follow-
ing entirely distinct method. Let the proposed equation (#J», 1)*=0, be for shortness
represented by @v=0, and let &, y be any two distinct roots ; we have not only

IN Writing 0=(z—y)*, s=#7+y, we have

e=(o+w/3 0), y=4(8—v/0),

values which are to be substituted for z, y in the equations
W— OY

ex+98y=0, IE,
We have thus two equations rational in s and 0, and the elimination between them of
the quantity s leads to the required equation in 0. But it is proper to modify the form
of the system ; in fact the two equations are, as regards s, the first of them of the degree n,
the second of the degree n—1 ; but if we write

ox=0, p&y=0, but also ex+y=0,

(@+9)(pr=8y) _ Q _f=99 =0,
T=y ET =

then each of the equations will be of the same degree n—1 in s. For instance, let @py=(, b, c, dv, 1), then a=4H(8+,\/0), y=4(8+\/0); the equations

n(pr+0y)—

"/=0, are

gpa+gy=

£4a+382b+3s(4c+a0)+8d+6b9=0,
38%a+83s 4b + 12c+a0 =0;
and multiplying the first equation by 3 and the second by —s, adding and dividing by 2,
we have an equation
830 +s8(12c+ 440)
