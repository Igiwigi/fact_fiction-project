The first of these causes, namely, the action of currents
of air in the room.in which these experiments were made, was
obviated by the form of the apparatus in-which the needle
was afterwards inclosed, and care was taken to render all
the parts of it as close as possible.

The second source of this retrograde motion might be
supposed to arise. from the movement‚Äù impressed on the air
within the lower cylinder of millboard 'being\ \communicated
through the screen, not by actually -passing through its
apertures, but by the vibrations it might impress on it. The
fact of the direction of the motion in the lower cylinder being
in the contrary direction to that of the needle in the upper
one, was exceedingly unfavourable to this hypothesis.

Before I relate the various experiments which I made, with
the view of successively placing each of these causes out of
action, I think it may be necessary to detail a few additional
experiments, in_ confirmation of the fact,

Using the same apparatus, I substituted a disc ' of copper,
5 inches in diameter, and Zz inch: thick, instead of that of
