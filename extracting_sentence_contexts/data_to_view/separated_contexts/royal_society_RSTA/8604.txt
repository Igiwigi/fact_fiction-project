Then there is an equation of the

ah d oM, oM,
$, (2, =o ay ‘Gq at)

for the motion in each g co-ordinate. The latter equations only involve the Lagrangian function L through the quantities
and # which enter into it, and once these are determined the rest of the solution
involves only the restricting conditions. In fact when once these multipliers and
variables are determined and regarded as functions of the time only the motion in
the g co-ordinates is completely determined by the condition that the integral

} >A,M, dt

is stationary for independent variations of the co-ordinates g. It may even happen
that the relations M involve the co-ordinates g and the variables in such a way that
it is possible to separate M into two terms, one of which is a function explicitly of the
qs only and the other of the a’s only. In this case the part of the integral required
in the above statement is only that part of it involving the q’s and this is independent
entirely of the co-ordinates «.
