temperature control. This not only permitted the verification of some of TRAUBE’S
experimental conclusions but also led to the discovery of other factors which are
involved in the phenomenon ; factors which must be taken into account in any
explanation of the mechanism involved.

Tt was found that when a liquid is heated above the critical temperature, not
only is there a difference in density above and below the point where the meniscus
was last seen but there is a discontinuity in the density gradient at this point. The
magnitude of the density difference is dependent on the mass per volume relationship
of the material, being greater the greater the mass per volume. The density
difference could not be destroyed by mechanical stirring, and it remained unchanged
during a period as long as six hours of continuous stirring. That the stirring was
effective was visibly demonstrated by the fact that just below the critical tempera-
ture downward streaming of the liquid in the vapour phase was produced each
time the float (WmNKLER and Maass, 1933) was lifted above the meniscus. This
showed that the liquid was actually carried up into the vapour region. This
intermingling of the upper and lower “ phases » due to stirring must, of course, have
been just as effective above the critical temperature. It was found that the difference

in density existing above the critical temperature decreases with rise in temperature
and eventually becomes zero. The increase in temperature above the critical
necessary for the equalization of the density is different for different substances. It
was also shown that once the density difference is destroyed by an increase in
temperature, a subsequent decrease in temperature is accompanied by the per-
sistence of a uniform density throughout the tube. In other words, no density
