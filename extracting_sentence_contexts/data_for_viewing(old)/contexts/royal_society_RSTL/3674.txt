On comparing these numbers, it will be at once evident that each addition of the
sulphocyanide produced relatively a smaller increase of colour. The numbers in fact
give the long curve of Plate VII. fig. 1, where the ordinates express the proportionate
amount of red salt, and the absciss the number of equivalents of the sulphocyanide.

The influence of mass was again tried by means of additional portions of ferric
nitrate instead of additional sulphocyanide of potassium. The experiment was con-
ducted in a precisely similar manner to the last. I have not thought it necessary to
record the amounts of the salts and the water employed: the following are the results
of the observations reduced as before :â€”
