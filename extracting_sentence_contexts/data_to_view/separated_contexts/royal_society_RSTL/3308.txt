10. The protoxide of silver, and some of its salts, now engaged my attention. Taking adyantage of the facts pointed out by WonrerÂ®, I exposed papers saturated
with a solution of the nitrate of silver, and dried in a cylinder which was kept hot by
boiling water, to a current of very pure heated hydrogen gas. By this means I ob-
tained a paper of a brick-red colour. This appears to be a nitrate of the protoxide of
silver ; by soaking this paper in rain water for 8ome time, the free acid was removed
from it, and on drying it became darker than before.
