from cell and environment states to the action of a SNAG.

The results of this section have natural analogues for the more general case where an
automaton A has a SNAG G as a divisor (homomorphic image of subgroup G of S(A)), then
G/N = G for anormal subgroup N in G, then we can use G instead of G to compute any function
f: X— G up to a coset using the same methods as above, that is, there is h in the Gx generated
by suitable*! subset F, with h(x) Ef (x)N, ie. h(xf(x)~t EN. This also applies to computing partial
functions f: X > G, which are less constrained.

Moreover, there are also many ways to employ direct product ensembles, independent copies
of the cell or system, by using multiple independent copies of (X,S) for any semigroup S acting
faithfully on a set X. In particular, this is true when X C Q and S = (X)per divides S(A), with
Sa SNAG. A useful fact via ‘computing in parallel’ is related to the interpretation of groups
in Gibbs’s viewpoint on ensembles. For any faithful permutation group (X,G), the right regular

This restriction might be removable also if the sequences produced would vary in time in response to state that changes
more quickly, but details of conditions that make this possible have not been characterized yet.

31F must separate points of X up to cosets and contain enough constants up to cosets: for the first, distinct points should map
to different cosets of N and, for the second, there must exist functions approximating constants for generators of G, i.e. values
must be in the same coset of G/N rather than strictly constant.


representation (G, G) with action gi - g = gig can be realized as a substructure of the direct product
of X-many copies of (X,G). That is, |X| instances of a regulatory network within a cell, or |X|
