be judged to be much lighter than a typical wild animal of similar skeletal dimensions. â€˜The
implication is that the captive animal wears its teeth more slowly than the wild one, so that
using its age as an indication of that of wild animals at a similar stage of dentition will give
a maximal estimate of the age of the wild ones. When captured on 31 October 1940, this
elephant was believed to be 6 to 9 months old, but the height at the withers is given as

80 cm a few days later, less than that of the smallest calf or the largest foetus in the present
series. Furthermore, although Dicksie was not weighed at the time, her first owner reports
that he could lift her clear of the ground, which indicated that she could not have been
much, if any, heavier than at birth. In fact, the estimate of 6 to 9 months was based on the
belief that the animal must have been born during the preceding dry season, and it has
already been shown that mating, and therefore calving, may occur at widely different
times of year. Thus this animal could not have been much over 9 years, and certainly
could not have reached 10 years of age, when measured in May 1949. The smallest, and
apparently the youngest, adult female in the present material (E147) was pregnant,
probably for the first time, and nearing mid-pregnancy. The condition of the molar teeth
suggests that E147 was older than Dicksie was when measured in 1950, at an age of 10 years
or a little over, but the wild animal was considerably the smaller of the two and may well
have been less than 10 years old. It will be noticed that the last milk molars were still in use
nearly half-way through gestation. The next animal in the series, E48, was a little bigger
and had just shed the last remains of the last milk molar. This animal was lactating; it is
not possible to determine how long post-partum it was, but it must have become pregnant
