He observes, that
a restriction ought to be applied to the conditions of this pro-
position, in order to insure the exact correctness of it; which
is, that the whole weight of the vessel shall be concentered in
the centre of gravity of the displaced volume; a condition
which may be deemed amongst the most extreme cases that
can be devised, and such as is rarely known to exist.} The
vessel's centre of gravity not being supposed coincident with
the centre of the displaced volume; M. BouGuerS gives the
true measure of stability when the angles of inclination are

x In vessels of burden, the freights of which. consist principally of iron, or other
metallic bodies, or blocks of stone, the vessels centre of gravity may be so depressed
as to coincide with, or even to be situated under, the centre of the immersed volume. But such a disposition causes many inconveniences in the ship's sailing ; and is never
adopted when it is possible to raise the centre of gravity to a higher position.

evanescent; the only objection to which is, that it stands in
the author's page as being explanatory, and illustrative of a
proposition before delivered : whereas, it is in fact the real pro-
position for measuring the horizontal stability of vessels; the
proposition it is intended to explain being a particular case of
it, and requiring a condition which scarcely ever takes place
in the practice of constructing and adjusting ships for sea. CASE VIII. The sides of a vessel are parallel to the masts above the
water-line, (fig. 17.) and project outward beneath it.
