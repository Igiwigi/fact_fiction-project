Figure 11 shows a transverse section of
a shoot which had been dissected by six radial longitudinal incisions, the apical meristem
being left intact. Here again it will be seen that the outlines of stele and shoot are in close

agreement. The rectangular or triangular outline of the stele in the lower region of an isolated
terminal region is to be related, in the first instance, to the initial incisions, and secondly,
to the fact that when the severed, incipient vascular tissue begins to grow, its outermost

cells undergo a parenchymatous development. In other words potential vascular tissue
becomes transformed into cortical parenchyma; the latter, at an early stage, can be seen
to extend as radial rows originating from thin-walled vascular elements (figure 111, plate 14).
