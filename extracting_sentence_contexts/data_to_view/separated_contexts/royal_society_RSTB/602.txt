The animal can now move the right leg well and hops about all
over the cage, climbing the rope and running after the other animals. There is, however, very little
movement in the left leg; occasionally I noticed a bilateral associated flexion of the hip and knee
joints.

43rd day.—Tested the sensibility at a meeting of the Physiological Society. Pricking and the hot
water test demonstrated the fact that the animal felt much better on the non-paralyzed side. Mr. Horsey recommended me to try Scurrr’s clamp test, which I have since found invaluable.
44th day.—A small pair of clip forceps was fixed on the skin of the foot, leg, and back, its attention
being attracted by my assistant to pieces of apple, so that the animal did not see what was being done.
