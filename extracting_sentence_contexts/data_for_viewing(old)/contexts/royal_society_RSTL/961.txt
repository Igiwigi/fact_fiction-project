Is my communication to Sir H. Davy, Bart, © On a new ful-
minating platinum,” which has been honoured with a place in
the Transactions of the Royal Society,* I stated, that I had'ob-
tained some other new compounds of this metal : these have
since occupied no inconsiderable portion of my leisure hours,
and I now beg leave to lay the results of my inquiry before
the Royal Society. A constant attention to other necessary
duties, has not allowed me sufficient time to render this inves=
tigation 80 complete as I could have wished ; but as I pre-
sume the facts are novel, I shall venture to bring them for-
ward in a form, which, though imperfect, may not be wholly
destitute of interest.

I. On @ peculiar compound of platinum, obtained from sulphate of
platinum, by the agency of alcohol.

Sulphate.of platinum, unlike the other metallic sulphates ,
in general, is, to a considerable extent, soluble in alcohol and
in ether ; as these fluids are capable, in cerrain circumstances,
of partial:y or wholly reviving Some metallic oxides from
their solutions in acids, I wished to try their effects on the
sulphate of platinum. Accordingly, I put into a small phial
