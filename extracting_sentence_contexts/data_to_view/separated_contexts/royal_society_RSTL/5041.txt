Moreover, the long blue beam and the narrow band did not
behave in the same manner under the action of the same coloured glass. 9. To my own mind these experiments were conclusive as to the fact of a change
of refrangibility. Admitting that the effect of a coloured glass is simply to stop a
certain fraction of the incident light, that fraction being a function of the refrangi-
bility, it is plain thar the results can be explained in no other way. It must be
confessed however that these results are merely an extension of that which precisely
constitutes the peculiarity of the phenomenon.
