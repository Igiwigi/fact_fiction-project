using a PowerMAG 100 stimulator (Mag & More, Munich,
Germany) with biphasic pulses and a figure-of-eight coil
(PMD70). First, optimal cortical representation of FDI muscle
(motor hot spot) was assessed by determining a coil position
over the EEG cap yielding the highest amplitude of the motor
evoked potential (MEP). Resting motor threshold (MEPs >
100 pV in at least 5/10 trials, cf. [48]) was determined, and
cTBS intensity was calibrated to 80% of resting motor threshold
in accordance with former studies [49]. This value was then

used for all stimulation protocols of the participant including
the second and third experimental session. All three experimen-
tal sessions were identical to the first one except for the fact
that the motor threshold was assessed only at the first session.
The stimulation site (right insular, right somatosensory cortices
or central occipital cortex as sham location) was selected
using a randomized protocol for all three experimental sessions,
ie. each participant was stimulated three times in a repea-
ted measurements design with identical test protocols. The
experimental procedure is depicted in figure 1.

Coil position for each stimulation site was located on the basis
of the 10/20 system supplied by the EEG cap (see below). Optimal
coil positions with respect to the 10/20 system were derived in the
following way: TMS neuronavigation (PowerMag View) was used
