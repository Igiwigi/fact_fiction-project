correction, which indicated that it was less than 1 per cent. at 100,000 — per
second,

The possible errors due to polarisation, even when using alternating currents, were
thoroughly appreciated by Konitrauscn, and in the ‘ Leitvermégen der Elektrolyte,’
by Kontrausca and Horgorn, means are described for minimising these errors. By
interpolation from their results the conductivity of sulphuric acid of the same
density and at the same temperature as that used in this experiment is
0:758 (ohm X centim.)~!, or a specific resistance of 1°319 xX 10° c.g.s., which
confirms the value of 1°30 xX 10° obtained in the present experiment at a frequency
of 50,000 — per second,

The fact that the power-factor is not unity at low frequencies proves that at
these frequencies the electrolyte does not behave like an ordinary resistance, and
consequently al/ the instantaneous values of the P.D. between the terminals of the
telephone sometimes used in the Kohlrausch method cannot be made to vanish at
