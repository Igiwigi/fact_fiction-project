In this case it is seen that practically no effect was produced by the light, a fact
which I afterwards learnt was to be expected, for a strong light merely tends towards
the special coloration which follows from the illumination of the surroundings of the
pupa, if such surroundings are coloured by any of the tints for which the organism is
sensitive. In all the experiments with green cylinders I had in mind the green form

of V. Jo and the green form of so many other dimorphic species (Papilio machaon,
Anthocaris cardamines, &c.). But I was soon convinced that Vanessa urtice has no
green form, and therefore in these experiments, in which green was the predominant
colour, the results produced showed no fixed relation to the chief part of the sur-
