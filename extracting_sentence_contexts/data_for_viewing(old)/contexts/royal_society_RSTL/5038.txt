A IN the following memoir, I propose to submit to the Royal Society a collection of
A facts observed with repeated and scrupulous care, which I trust will suffice to
E establish the propositions, viz. that in invertebrate animals there exist two distinct
Z nutritious flaids, dissimilar in their anatomical relations, and different in their
s chemical and vital compositions ; that, in the animal series, a gradation from the
= simple to the complex is observed in the fluid as well as in the solid elements of the
> organism ; that these two constituent parts of the animal body bear towards each
:S other, whether in simplicity or complexity, a constant and direct proportion ; that
ie the true blood-system does not begin at the beginning of the animal series, but that it
arises out of (what in this memoir will be called) the chylaqueous fluid, of which the
-2 blood-proper is the perfected eyolution ; that the chylaqueous fluid is as much less
= vitalized than the true-blood, as the solid structures of the animals in which the
Z former exists are less complex than the analogous parts of those in which the latter
S is found; that the containing system of the blood-proper is distinguished, with the
