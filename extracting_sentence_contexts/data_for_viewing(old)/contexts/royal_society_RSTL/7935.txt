These numbers correspond with the formula (Mgz Fez)Si O,, which is identical with
the bronzite of the Manegaum meteorite *. :

In fact the olivine found by RAMMELSBERG does not exist in the sample of the meteorite
analyzed at the Britich Museum. This is probably due to the portions of the meteorite
examined in his laboratory and mine being from different parts of the mass.

To check these determinations, a portion of the mottled variety was submitted to the
action of acid in the cold, and s8ubsequent treatment with alkali to remove the liberated
sllicic acid. The results now given show this action to have been confined to that of a
solvent.

L. By treatment with a mixture of one part of strong hydrogen chloride and two of
water for sisxty-six hours in the cold, and subsequently with soda, there were removed
the following percentages of
