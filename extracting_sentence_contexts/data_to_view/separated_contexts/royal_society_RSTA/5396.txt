The striking
manifestation of the non-metallic state of ‘expanded’ mercury is testament to this
critical aspect (figure 7). The classification ‘metal or non-metal?’ is therefore not an inherent anc
unchanging property for any element, or indeed any substance, material or
system. For the chemical elements of the periodic table, density is indeed a critica!
thermodynamic parameter governing either their metallic or their non-metallic
status; the data reviewed here surely represent a remarkable manifestation o
that fact. The transition from non-metallic to metallic hydrogen at high pressures o
several megabars also has far-reaching consequences for the interior of gian’
planets such as Jupiter, Saturn or Jupiter-like extrasolar planets that have
been detected in great number since 1996. Hydrogen and helium are by far
the most abundant elements in nature and contribute about 98 per cent to
their planetary masses.
