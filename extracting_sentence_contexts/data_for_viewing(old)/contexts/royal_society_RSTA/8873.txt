is not varying with the voltage to an extent ascertainable by these experiments. What
is important is that the standard current should be saturated, and it was convenient
to employ the least voltage that would make sure of this. It was also felt that until
more information was available about the phenomenon, it was desirable to employ as
the voltage for the determination of the standard current a voltage which would occupy
the same position on each characteristic. For example, it was not, and is still not,
known with certainty whether there is a small variation of current with voltage on the
flat parts of the curves. If there is any such change, the values of the relative currents
would be affected by the value of the voltage at which it was decided to measure the
standard saturation current. The method adopted ensures that there are no errors
arising from considerations of this character, which would be appreciable in comparison
with the unavoidable experimental error. In all the curves but two the original three-
volt standard could be retained. In fact, it approximately satisfied the condition just
described, the current at zero volts in these cases being on the rapidly rising part of the
characteristic.

The relative currents thus obtained were then plotted for each series against the
actual volts given by the voltmeter and the amount of displacement along the voltage
axis was judged, which would be necessary to bring all the curves as nearly as possible
to coincidence. This amount is, of course, in general different for the different curves,
but is the same for every experimental point belonging to any one curve. The dis-
placements are not applied to the curves, which constitute a secondary inference from
the experimental data, but to the primary source of evidence, the experimental points
themselves, The absolute position of the composite curve in relation to the scale of
