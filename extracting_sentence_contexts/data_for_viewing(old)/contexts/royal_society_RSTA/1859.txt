notation of [Ar]. According to the traditional account, the 3d orbitals only begin to fill when the
scandium atom is reached on progressing through the periodic table and only after the 4s orbital
has been doubly occupied. If this is correct, it raises something of a conundrum because the first
ionization of this element, and subsequent first transition elements, involves the removal of a 4s
electron [33].

Textbook authors and chemistry instructors typically advance ad hoc explanations in an
attempt to rationalize this clearly illogical situation. If the 3d orbital electron is the last to enter
the atom, it should be the one to be ionized instead of a 4s electron.

What Schwarz has asserted is that in scandium and following transition metal atoms, the
3d orbitals are in fact occupied before, or in preference to, the 4s orbital and there is ample
experimental evidence for this claim [34]. The advantage of Schwarz’s version of the facts is that
it restores logic to the situation. The 4s electrons are the last to enter the atom in the sense of the
build-up of the configuration and consequently are the least stable, and so the first to be ionized.”

7The energy of an orbital cannot be specified independently of the occupancy of the orbital due to e-e repulsion. So in a Ti
atom with configuration 3d24s2, 4s lies above 3d. However, in the configuration 3d34s1, 3d lies above 4s due to the extra
3d-3d repulsion—in both cases removal of the outermost electron gives us Ti+ with a ground state configuration 3d24s1.
Furthermore, the ordering of orbitals does change as we move across the periodic table—so for example in S, the lowest
totally unoccupied orbital is 3d, but by the time we get to Na and Ca, 4s is lower than 3d.
