From experiments with ammonium chloride, sulphate, phosphate, tartrate, benzoate,
and hippurate, FeLrz and RITTER concluded that ammoniacal salts all had a similar
action, producing convulsions and coma, slowing of the pulse and lowering of the
temperature. They considered the action to be the same in kind, bub differing m
intensity. The convulsions produced by ammoniacal salts were shown by Fuxks and
Dxanxa to be similar to the tetanus produced by strychnia, differing from it only in
the fact that a single convulsjon instead of a series of convulsions was produced by
the poison. The cause of this result they believed to be the rapid production of
paralysis of the motor nerves by the ammoniacal salt, which prevented the occurrence of
more than one tetanic conyulsion. As the action of chloride of ammonium has already been pretty thoroughly investi-
gated, it seemed to us unnecessary to make any more experiments upon its general
action.
