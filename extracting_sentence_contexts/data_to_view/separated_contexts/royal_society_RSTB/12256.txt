Real-
time detection of specific SWR features can be used for a variety of interventions that causally test the importance of such fea-
tures. For instance, selectively disrupting forward or reverse replay may reveal distinct behavioural impairments associated with
each. Recording in putative readout areas while artificially triggering SWRs, and inhibiting synaptic terminals in triggered on
SWRs occurring, can provide complementary evidence that a given neuron or area, in fact, performs a readout.
