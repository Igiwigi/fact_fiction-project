'=a considerable number of years ago, and which, since that time, I had to defend against
=the objections of others, both by experimental inquiries of my own, and by the collection
Zand discussion of facts elicited in the investigations of other observers. As far back as
51841* T pointed out that in analogous compounds the same difference of composition
frequently involves the same difference in boiling-points. The assertion of the existence
of this law-like relation between the chemical composition of substances and one of
Ztheir most important physical properties, when first enunciated, met rather with the
:Zopposition than with the assent of chemists, In Germany especially it was contested
by ScurODER in his memoir © On the Molecular Volume of Chemical CompoundsF.”
SThese objections led me to collect additional evidencef, in favour of my views, and to
Sshow more particularly that in yery extensive 8eries of compounds (alcohols C, H,.,O,;
Sacids C, H, O,; compound ethers C, H, O,, &c.) an elementary difference aC, H, is
5 attended by a difference of xz x 19* C. in the boiling-points, and how this fact is intimately
Sconnected with other regularities exhibited by the boiling-points of organic compounds,
YAlmost at the ame period ScuRODERy convinced himself that the relation I had pointed
Sout obtains in most cases. He collected himself a considerable number of illustrations
= of the regularities I had traced, and showed that the relation in question is rendered

more especially conspicuous if the compounds be expressed by formulz representing

equal vapour-yolumes of the several substances. Some of the views, however, which

were peculiar to SCHRGDER have not gained the approbation of chemists, This physicist

was inclined to consider the boiling-point of a substance as the most essential criterion
