gaseous mixtures, and its application to their analysis. 28g

From the foregoing Table it appears, that carbonic oxide
produces the greatest effect, in the smallest proportion to an
; explosive mixture, of oxygen and hydrogen, in preventing
| the action of those gases on each other, when exposed to the
sponge at temperatures below the boiling point of mercury. In general, those gases which either do not unite with oxy-

= gen, or: unite with it only at high temperatures, have little
= effect in restraining the efficiency of the sponge. - There is
jE an apparent exception, however, in cyanogen, which it would
= require more research than I have yet had time to devote to an
Z object merely collateral to reconcile it, if it be capable of being
= reconciled, with the general principle. E, From the fact that carbonic oxide, olefiant gas, and car-
Z buretted hydrogen, when brought to unite with, oxygen by
S means of the platinum sponge assisted by heat, undergo this
S change at different temperatures, it seemed an obvious-con-
i= clusion, that by exposing a mixture of those gases with each
= other and with oxygen to a regulated temperature, the cor-
= rect analysis of such mixtures might probably be accom-
[5 plished. Mixtures of two. or more of the combustible gases
fo were therefore exposed, in contact with oxygen gas and the
= platinum sponge, in tubes bent into the shape of retorts,
65 which were immersed in a mercurial bath. This bath was
S gradually heated to the required temperatures, and by proper
5 management of the source of heat, was prevented from rising
A above that degree.

1st, By subjecting 25 measures of carbonic oxide, 15 of
olefiant gas, and 57 of oxygen, in contact with the sponge,
to a heat which was not allowed to exceed g50% FAHRENHEIT
till the diminution of volume ceased, all the carbonic oxide
