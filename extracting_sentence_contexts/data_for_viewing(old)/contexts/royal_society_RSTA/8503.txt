their usual signification. It has been found that this law is almost invariably obeyed at
relatively high temperatures, but in general it does not hold at low temperatures.

Other writers have proposed various modifications of the theory, in particular, Gans*
allowed for the effect of the mutual interactions of the molecules. He found that if the
molecule possesses a figure axis the substance will be paramagnetic, but the dependence
on temperature of the susceptibility at low temperatures given by the theory is not in
good agreement with the experimental facts.

Foixt has extended the theory of Wxiss by considering the effect of the introduction
of the following ideas (1) a molecular field equal to mz (¢ = magnetisation), in
which has in general different values along the principal axes of the crystal and (2)
there exists a potential energy which is a function of the direction in the crystal. An
account of this theory, as far as it concerns the principal susceptibilities of crystals, will
be found in Part IT. Foix also considers in considerable detail the possible phenomena
shown by the mean of the principal susceptibilities, z.e., the quantity determined by
measurements on powdered materials. He shows that the theory predicts the existence
of the following phenomena: (1) At the higher temperatures the Wextss law holds,
(2) at the lower temperatures the susceptibility may increase either more rapidly or
less rapidly with fall in temperature than is given by the Wetss law, (3) the curve of the
