We see again that the second
curve, which was longer in period as a whole than either of the other two, manifests this
excess in each of its branches, that is to say, its left or ascending branch is larger as a
whole than the same branch of the other two curves, and the same takes place for the
Second or descending branch. On the other hand, the maximum of this curve is not 80

high as that of either of the other two—in fact the curye has the appearance as if it
were pressed down from aboye, and pressed out laterally 80 as to lose in elevation
what it gains in time. Lastly, after undergoing the process of equalization which has been described, there is
ﬆtill the appearance in all the three curves of a secondary maximum in the 8econd
branch ; and this peculiarity has induced us to compare the solar curves with the curves
of brightness of two variable stars, the peculiarities of which haye been well determined. We annex with this purpose the light-curve of R.
