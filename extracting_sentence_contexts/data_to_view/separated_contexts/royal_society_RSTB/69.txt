Experiment 12.â€”The observations within an hour after excision were very uniform as regards
excitatory effects, viz., diphasic variations according to the point of excitation; in the second half of the
first hour we noticed that, whereas a stronger stimulus was still capable of giving typical diphasic varia-
tions, viz., NS by excitation at A, SN by excitation at B, a weaker stimulus gave only a single variation,
viz., N by excitation at A, S by excitation at B. Presumably, the excitability was not far removed from
uniformity, and with this agrees the fact that the two contacts were practically iso-electric. The
spontaneous beats indicated the passage of an excitatory change from B to A.

Later, in the second half-hour, the excitatory effects continued uniform, viz., NS by excitation at A,
SN by excitation at B; the noteworthy point during this period was the appearance of spontaneous
variations NS; these were not properly spontaneous, but consequent upon excitation, each stimulus at A
giving not merely one variation NS, but a series of two, three, or more such variations at intervals. Experiment
