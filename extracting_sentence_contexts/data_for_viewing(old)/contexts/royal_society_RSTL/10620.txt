352 LORD RAYLEIGH ON THE CONSTANT OF MAGNETIC

Crank cell itself being treated as a standard of E.M.F., by which to determine the
value of the current, which traversed the known resistance, and also the helix by
which the magnetic rotation was produced. The arrangements differed 80 little from
those elaborately described in the paper referred to, that it geems unnecessary to enter
into the matter at length. If the reader will refer to Plate 17, fig. 1, he will
understand the electrical connexions, and he may 8uppose the current-measuring
apparatus EGF, replaced by the magnetising helix. Tn point of fact this helix was
situated in another room ab a distance from the E.M.F. compensator and its galvano-
meter T. The direction of the current in the helix was reversed by a mercury key
of the rocker pattern, and care had to be taken bhab at this moment the galvano-
meter contact Q was open. The general nature of the arrangement will be sufficiently
understood when it is said that the want of balance between the E.M.F. of the
CLARK and that at the terminals of the resistance R was made up by E.M.F., taken
from an auxiliary circuit, the value of which was afterwards expressed in terms of the
CLarx. Denoting the force thus added or subtracted by 7, upon a scale according to
which the force of the CLaRk was p, the actual difference of potential at the terminals
of R may be written
