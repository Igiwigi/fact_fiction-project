it is directed downwards, and if not as much backwards as in Dicotyles at least not forwards
as in Sus.

It is probable that most of these characters hang of necessity together and are con-
nected with the downwardly directed Dicotyles-like upper canine. Further, it is quite
true that when any of them are examined in detail, they can be shown not to correspond
exactly with conditions in the Dicotyline. It is clear that Charotherium can neither be
the direct descendant of Doliochwrus, than which it is throughout of a more delicate

build, nor the direct ancestor of Dicotyles, but the very fact that most of its tendencies are
so Dicotyline—that the course of its evolution has been so parallel to theirs—seems to me
to indicate an initial relationship. Certain other tendencies peculiar to the genus were
clearly at work: the teeth are extremely simple, the upper molars without intermediate
conules, m* with practically no talon, p‘ has not taken on the characters of a molar
(although in outline surprisingly Dicotyline owing to the forward position of the inner
cone with a broad postero-internal cingulum behind it), p, has but a single main cusp,
and the lower incisors are without the characteristic ridges* of other Suide. Most of
these characters it seems possible to regard as a reduction and simplification of an earlier
more typically Dicotyline condition. If it were certain that Doliochewrus and Percherus
were in the direct ancestral line of Dicotyles, then it could be asserted that Charotherium
must have split off from that line at a period earlier than the Oligocene beds in which
these make their appearance, but still this would not prevent Charotherium from being
