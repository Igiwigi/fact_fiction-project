and is uniquely resoluble into its permutable and combinatorial parts.
101. Writing generally for any three quaternions, p, g, and 7,

Sif (pq) = Spf" (rg) =Sqf"(pr) - ss (414),

we shall call the new functions f’ (pq), f” (pq) the first and second conjugates of
S (pq). In fact (pq) is the conjugate when the first quaternion p alone varies, and
St" (pq) is the conjugate when the second varies.

102. As the accents employed to denote the permutate and the first and second
conjugates are not commutative in order of application, it is safer to use brackets in
the rare cases in which double accents are necessary. ‘Thus

S (pd) = (0) (od) = (0) (ot) = (A) (Pg) ee (415),
