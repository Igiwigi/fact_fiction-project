parent, and to have no visible muscular structure. From the
effects produced by the different parts of this bag while the
animal is alive, being exactly similar to the contractions and
relaxations of the muscular fibres in- the human body, we
must conelude that this membrane is possessed of a similar
power ; and consequently, has the same right to be called
muscular.

The hydatid, from its apparent want of muscles, and other
parts which generally .constitute. an‚Äù animal, was for a long
while denied its place in the animal world, and considered as
the production of disease ; we are, however, at present in pos-
