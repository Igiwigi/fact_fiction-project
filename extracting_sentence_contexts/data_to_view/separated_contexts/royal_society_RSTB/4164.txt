Introductory. We propose to show in this section that the depressant factor can be traced to a
cumulative toxic effect produced in the cells of the growing points by water strain,
and that the environmental and structural conditions are such that the earliest
sowings receive the greatest number of “ doses” of this toxin. The interpretation
centres round the fact that the stringency of the root’s environment decreases as the
soil temperature rises, this improvement in the absorptive capabilities of the root
being more than sufficient to compensate for the increased stringency of the
environment of the stem. Before doing so we may briefly indicate two explanations which have formerly
been offered regarding the delayed development of early sowings. The first of these
is that the average of the population raised from early sowings is lowered by the
inclusion of many stunted plants ; while such is actually the case, it does not suffice
as an explanation; the presence of exceptionally stunted plants “dilutes” the
observed phenomena, but does not alter their nature, and we can see from fig.
