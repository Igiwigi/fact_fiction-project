and taking into account the fact that (205) and (206) must hold good on the hyper-
surface, W (¢,, 42), the condition (203) may be transformed into the equivalent

Again two classes of alternatives H, must be considered separately: (a) if
b, = a" — a, > 0, then the region w» (¢,, $2) will be defined by
(b) if, however, b, = a, — a,” <0, then instead of the above inequality, we shall
have

The solutions in both cases are analogous, so we shall consider only the case (a). The problem consists in determining k’’, (%, S92) so as to satisfy the condition (204). This is equivalent to the equation

b, (@ — 2) SK’ (Zp, 8,7), (208)

k’ being a new constant depending upon %, and s,?
