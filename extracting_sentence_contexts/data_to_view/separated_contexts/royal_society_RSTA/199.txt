This version was one in which the central dogma
of biology was taken to mean that the genetic material is never modified by the
rest of the organism and the environment. Francis Crick’s original statements of
the ‘central dogma of molecular biology’ (Crick 1958, 1970) do not in fact make
such a strong claim. He stated a more limited chemical fact: that DNA sequences
are used as templates to make proteins, but proteins are not used as reverse
templates to make DNA. So, even if its proteins were to become modified during
the lifetime of an individual, that modification cannot be inherited. The ‘dogma’
was then interpreted by many biologists to mean that information flows only one
way.
