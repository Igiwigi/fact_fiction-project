This irregularity may be clearly seen in the foreshortened view
of the plates obtained in figure 14. A similar arrangement of setae is found on the plates
of C. oryzae, which have been compared with those of C. granaria, but in this species a stout
apically directed spine replaces the slight marginal irregularity of C. granaria. Owing to the shape of the individual plates, and the fact that the lumen of the proven-
triculus narrows posteriorly, the entrance gaps to the sieve diminish posteriorly (figure
20, sv.). As a result of the divergence of the apices of the plates already mentioned, however,
the exit gaps expand posteriorly (figure 20, sv.â€™). The apical setae of the plates emphasize
this condition by being curved away from the exit gaps posteriorly and arching over the
rear of the entrance gaps, where they interlock with the setae of the adjacent double row
of plates (figure 14).
