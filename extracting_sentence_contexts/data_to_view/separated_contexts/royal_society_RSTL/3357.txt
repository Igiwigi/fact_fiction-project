In an Eel, which to all appearance was in perfect health, and contained as usual
among its muscles, a considerable quantity of fat, one fasciculus of the same size as
the rest, instead of presenting the muscular snbstance, was reduced to a mere dia-
phanous tube, containing a number of minute parasitic worms, coiled up like the
Trichina spiralis, and closely packed together (figs. 41 to 45.). The sarcolemma was

quite entire, and seemed without disease, but no trace of fibrillee conld be discerned
on the closest examination. In fact, the sheath of the fasciculus was the only part
remaining, the rest baving probably become the food of these entozoa. As both ends
of the tube remained open, having been broken off, several of the worms escaped from
their confinement, and began to show signs of life, uncoiling themselves, and moving
about lightly in different directions, with an undulating motion (fig. 42.). They
were about th of an inch in length, blunt at one end, and tapering considerably
towards the other.
