data production capabilities in biosciences, we would argue that there is an emergent need to
understand the biological systems producing the data beyond statistical correlations. Instead,
of mathematical modelling we have witnessed the emergence of fields such as bioinformatics,
focused on management, signal extraction and statistical and machine-learning based analysis
of the large and diverse data [7]. The medical and biological communities are in this narrow
sense forced to accept the infusion of computational techniques for data analysis. In practice,
statistics and machine-learning methods have therefore become increasingly important to find
patterns or correlations in complex datasets, whereas mechanistic mathematical modelling has
not become mainstream.
In our view, we find two contrasting perspectives on the topic of mathematics in general
and computational modelling in particular in biosciences. On the one hand, modelling living
systems and diseases appears unrealistic; possibly, if we wait a century or two then we may
have assembled all the facts and observations [8]. This is a viewpoint not uncommon in the
life-science community in general and among medical doctors in particular. The idea being
that we need to have ‘all’ the experimental facts on the table before even embarking upon
such an ambitious modelling task. In short, this line of thinking could be one of the reasons
why mathematical modelling is not and has not (yet) become mainstream within medicine
and biology.


At the other end of the spectrum, we find the view that modelling biological systems is
relatively speaking straightforward. As the governing equations of atomistic systems are well
defined, there is no doubt that modelling is useful and interesting. This view comes through most
clearly among investigators with training in the hard sciences such as physics, chemistry and
mathematics.
