Now, consider
the bigger null cone with vertex the point A such that B,C lie on it (ie. both B,C are on A’s
past null cone). Since they are on A’s past, B,C can both synchronize with A, which means that
the original points D,E, although never in causal contact with each other, can acquire similar
properties because they become in sync with the common point A. This argument suggests that
sync may in fact lead to a new approach to the horizon problem. Another possible implication of sync is related to the behaviour of entropy on approach to
the past singularity. This is connected to the fact that each time two spatial point trajectories in
inhomogeneous space-time synchronize with each other, the entropy of the system reduces as a
result of syne: information about the states of the spatial points before sync is lost after sync as they
now evolve in unison to one another, so the asymptotic rate of creation of information towards the
past singularity is thus reduced, cf. [60].
