From a study of existing X-ray data on proteins§ the interpretation of these
results seems clear, that, in fact, the spacing 9-8 A. common to both «- and @-photographs
arises from the lateral extension of the side-chains (the R-groups of the general
formula given above), while the spacing 4-65 A.|| represents the distance of approach
of the main-chains on those sides free from side-chains. The controlling factor
in this closest approach of neighbouring “ backbones” is most probably attraction

{ Much the greatest proportion of the amino-acid mixture obtained by the hydrolysis of silk fibroin is
glycine and alanine, but it is not certain that the X-ray photograph is incompatible with arrangements
other than strict alternation of the residues of these two acids.

|| In I attention was drawn to the fact that this spacing is practically equal to the chief spacing in the
X-ray photograph of cystine, the most abundant amino-acid in hair; but in the light of subsequent

evidence, we wish now to withdraw the suggestion that the two spacings have anything more than a
numerical relationship. STRUCTURE OF HAIR, WOOL, AND RELATED FIBRES. 373
