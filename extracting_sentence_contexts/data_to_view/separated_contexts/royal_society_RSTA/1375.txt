The solution achieved by the two algorithms is different because the cost function, both data
fidelity term and regularizer, that OS-PWSQS [14] aims at minimizing is different from (3.1). By
analysing figure 4a, it is possible to highlight that the Denoising-IHS algorithm achieves a more
accurate solution. Looking in detail at the blue curve, it is possible to note some local plateaus
with sudden reduction of the error, and this is in agreement with the fact that in the outer loop
the divergence of the denoiser is calculated to update the ridge leverage scores (6.1) which has
a cost equivalent of applying the denoiser as stated in (6.2). Furthermore, figure 4b shows the
comparison in objective function between the convergence plot (semi-log) in dB of the Denoising-
THS algorithm and the solver which consider the full Hessian of the data loss at each iteration. This plot highlights how the strategy for block sub-sampling of the Hessian leads to a notable
reduction in computation (almost 2.2 times) while both reach a similar minimum value in the cost
