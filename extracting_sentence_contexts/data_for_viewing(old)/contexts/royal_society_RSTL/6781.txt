the physiological conditions haye been such as to require available Nitrogen, and

must therefore have been more or less favourable to the assimilation of free Nitrogen,
provided such assimilation were possible. Tence, the fact that this did not take place

case of these Graminacerw, it is not possible.

Some of the remarks which we haye made with regard to the influence of a supply of
combined Nitrogen upon the growth of the Graminaceze, apply also, in a greater or
less degree, to the other plants experimented npon.. We shall not comment here in
detail upon the value of each experiment, but simply call attention to the columns of
Nitrogen, in the Tables, and to the notes in the Appendix indicating the
