you a short account of these fossil remains,
which, (though fully aware of the weight of those arguments
you lately urged in conversation, as unfavourable to the pro-
bability of their high antiquity) I am still led to consider as
not altogether uninteresting to the geologist. The neglect of
the more recent formations of rocks was one principal cause
that the nature and origin of the older had been 80 strangely
misunderstood : it is to the more attentive observation that
has of late years been paid to the phenomena which they pre-
sent, that we are indebted for the knowledge of the important
fact, that secondary fossils are the productions and depositions
of various periods; by which happy discovery the study of
these remains, formerly a puerile and frivolous pursuit, has
become a most important branch of natural science, The
osseous relics of a later period are more particularly calculated
to furnish data for the future construction of a philosophical

theory, at least of the crust of the earth. Tt appears there-
fore strange, that these latter, although they speak a far more
intelligible language than the rest, should, till within a very
short period, have been almost entirely disregarded by the
Speculative geologist. Bones, the most distinctly organized,
were $0 very imperfectly understood, even in the beginning
of the last century, that Dr. CARL, in his Oss:um fossilium doci-
masia, published at Frankfurt in 1704, found it necessary to
employ all his powers of reasoning, aided by chemical ana-
lysis, to prove that they were neither /usus nature, nor the
results of a vs plaslica of the earth.
