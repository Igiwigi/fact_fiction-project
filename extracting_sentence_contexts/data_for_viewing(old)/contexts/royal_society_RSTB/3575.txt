what one would naturally expect from its structure, for, although it is pointed at
its posterior end whilst its anterior end is rounded or slightly flattened, and therefore
slightly larger, the density of the middle and posterior regions is probably greater,
through the inclusion of them of the chlorophyll bodies, paramylum grains and
nucleus, than the anterior end, which contains a vacuolar space—the pharyngeal
eavity—and a pulsating vacuole.

If the Euglene are in a dense mass, they may assume all possible positions
in falling, but this is due to their being entangled with one another; this is
especially the case when they have been kept for a long time in the fixing fluid.
When precautions are taken to prevent overcrowding and entanglement, if is rare
to find an individual which falls with its anterior end downwards. The orientation
is, in fact, precisely similar to that observed in the downward moving streams of the
living cells during aggregation, and is in opposition to their normal direction of
movement. We thus see that the conditions for a purely mechanical explanation
of the downward movement are fulfilled, and that an appeal to geotaxis is
unnecessary. The following experiment supports this conclusion. A horizontal tube
in which Euglenz were aggregating, as shown in fig. 3, a, was gently moved into a
slanting position so that the streams were at an angle to the direction of the
gravitational force. The streams at once became bent into a vertical or nearly
vertical direction (Plate 33, fig. 19).

The effect of gravity is observed only under certain conditions. If they are not
