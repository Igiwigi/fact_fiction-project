Tt will be noticed that the supersaturation required to cause condensation is
practically the same in CO, as in the other gases, in spite of the great difference
in v/v}. The supersaturation is in each case the greatest which can exist at the temperature
t,° C. without condensation resulting. To find to what extent this depends upon the temperature, we may make use of
the fact that v,/2, when the resulting supersaturation is just sufficient to cause
condensation, is in the case of air constant for temperatures between 15°5°C.
and 288°C,
