received between the ex-occipital bones, so that they take part in forming the condyle,
though their extension downward to the base of the skull is not less marked than in
Pareiasaurus. The interest of this specimen consists in the evidence it affords that
the basi-occipital bone is essentially an intercentral ossification at the back of the
skull, which has become enlarged and blended with the skull under mechanical
conditions. If it had not been developed, or had not been in bony union with the
skull, then the head would have terminated posteriorly in two occipital condyles
formed by the ex-occipital bones, between which there would be an inferior notch.
Such a hypothetical condition is so suggestive of the Labyrinthodont mode of union
of the skull with the vertebral column, as to indicate a possible method of transition
from the Amphibian form of occipital condyle to such a type as is seen in Chelonian
Reptiles by the blending of a notochordal ossification with the head. If we consider
the structure of an Amphibian skull, there can be no @ priori difficulty from the fact
= that it would bring the ex-occipital bones to some extent into bony union with the
basi-sphenoid ; but the posterior pre-condylar surface of these bones, which is in front
of the basi-occipital, appears to project posteriorly for 15 millims. beyond the basi-
sphenoid.

The basi-sphenoid (bs) is partially blended with the pterygoid bone (pt), and the
prominent oblong bony mass at the back of the palate is about 9 centims. long.
Its external or lateral surfaces are concave in length, so as to constrict the transverse
measurement to 5 c√©ntims. towards the anterior end, but posteriorly the bone widens,
; attaining a transverse measurement of about 8 centims., and terminating in two
parallel convex bosses which are below and in front of the occipital condyle. In
Dicynodon and Ptychognathus the corresponding processes have a much greater deve-
