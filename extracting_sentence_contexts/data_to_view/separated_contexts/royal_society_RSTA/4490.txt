These are the constants which determine the position and algebraical equation to the
frequency curve, and we see at once that they are all determined with a close degree
of accuracy. The Jargest percentage probable error is in p, but this is under
3°5 per cent., and, owing to the high correlation between p and y a much larger
error would produce no sensible change in the shape of the curve. Two important facts may also be drawn from these results, which indeed follow
from the general formule, namely :

(i.) The position of the mean is sensibly more exactly determined than the position
of the mode. Here about 1°7 times as accurately.

(ii.)
