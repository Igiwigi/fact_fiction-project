4. Energetics and diffusion for twist grain boundaries

The first test of the Fe-H TB model is to evaluate the H-free grain boundary energies ycp for the
four considered grain boundaries; these energies are obtained using the usual formula

where Eel) is the total energy of the TB simulation cell, Ney is the total number of atoms in the
cell, EG is the energy per atom of pure a-Fe at the simulation cell volume and Ace is the area of
the considered grain boundary. The factor of 2 arises from the fact that the simulation cell has two
equivalent grain boundaries. In order to obtain the lowest-energy structure, rigid translations of
the grains with respect to one another parallel to the grain boundary plane were performed, but
were not found to lower the energy of the system.

The summary of the results for ygp is given in table 1. The bulk-like £3 grain boundary has the
lowest energy of the four boundaries: the value of vee ~ 0.32) m7? is in excellent agreement with
both the ab initio results obtained and the embedded-atom method modelling of Ratanaphan et al.

of the grain boundary, y¢ are the grain boundary energies evaluated with the TB model, and yg are the grain boundary
energies evaluated via DFT.
