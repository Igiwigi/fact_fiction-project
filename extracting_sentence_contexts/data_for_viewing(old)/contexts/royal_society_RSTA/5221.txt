the differences obtained in terms of mean judgements and the variance accounted for in
the regression analyses were relatively modest. The experimental manipulation itself had a
significant impact on only some of the variables we measured (although there was a clear and
significant effect on ratings of the convincingness of the opposing arguments). This suggests
that the materials constructed for the study did not evoke strong reactions from participants.
More interactive materials—perhaps involving video presentations or explanatory graphics—
may have enhanced their effectiveness. Support for geoengineering was not significantly altered
by the experimental manipulation at all, and, in line with previous literature, people with
higher and lower levels of scepticism responded to the argument in different ways [38]. This
suggests that the overall impact of moral hazard arguments in public and policy discourse
may be simply to reinforce existing beliefs. For those strongly opposed to geoengineering,
the moral hazard argument presents another piece of evidence confirming their views; for
those sceptical about climate change, the moral ‘hazard’ of reducing mitigation is in fact not a
hazard at all.

In addition, it is clear that the counter moral hazard argument could have been constructed
differently. In this study, the argument states that, although geoengineering may distract from
current policies, this is not in fact a moral hazard. An alternative—and arguably just as plausible—
counter-argument would be that, although reducing current commitments on mitigation would
be a negative outcome, geoengineering will not in fact cause this to happen. In other words,
geoengineering will coexist with existing policies, in the same way that adaptation now coexists
with mitigation.


However, while there are undoubtedly multiple ways of conceiving of the moral hazard
