The rate of cooling from
100°-95° was then noted and compared with that of the kata-thermometer exposed to
still air at the same temperature. The difference gave us approximately the rate of
cooling due to convection. There is’ an unavoidable error due to the fact that the
kata heats the wall of the vacuum tube and thus the kata is surrounded in part by an
enclosure warmer than the walls of the chamber. This error naturally will be greater
when the chamber is cold. Table V. gives results as calculated and found by direct
measurement :—

We conclude that in still air at ordinary room temperature the rate of cooling at
body temperature is due as much to radiation as to convection, when the walls of the
observation chamber are at the same temperature as the air inside it.
