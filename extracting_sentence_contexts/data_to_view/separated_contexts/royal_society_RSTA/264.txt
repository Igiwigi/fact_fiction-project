We were both a
supervised by Michael, himself the student of Henry Chilver, who got his PhD from the {3B
University of Bristol under the supervision of Alfred Pugsley (1903-1998), the father of :3
structural safety to engineering in the UK over most of the last century. :f

Myself, I take great pride by my own research supervision, by Academician Vladimir Vasilievich al
Bolotin (1926-2008), who was the father of structural safety in Russia over most of the second :3
half of the last century and the beginning of the present one. The classic books of Sir Alfred 78
Pugsley (1903-1998) [46] (with whom I had a chance to correspond on matters of structural safety) :
and Bolotin [47] strongly influenced uncertainty analysis, worldwide. This above ‘genealogy’
of Michael perhaps explains the fact that he embraced the probabilistic approach—unlike
many contemporaries—and proposed the probabilistic theory of imperfection sensitivity [48],
independently of Bolotin. I am pleased to share this statistical ‘ancestry’ with Michael, in addition
to the broad themes of stability and nonlinear dynamics, albeit in different directions. Some four
decades later Michael returned to the probabilistic concepts in a paper with Jan Sieber [49].
