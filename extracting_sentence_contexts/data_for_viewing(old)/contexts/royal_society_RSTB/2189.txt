Influence of tetanisation upon the normal retinal response to light. Ordinary arrangement of induction
coil, fed by two Leclanché cells. Secondary coil at 9 centims. (5000 units on Berne scale). ‘Two periods
of tetanisation, T, and T, each lasting 1 minute. After the first tetanisation the positive response
is considerably augmented, and falls during illumination. The terminal positive deflection at break
of light is abolished, After the second tetanisation the positive response is further augmented.

Augmentation of the positive response to light is the principal and typical after-
effect of tetanisation of the retina. Many points of inquiry arise from this principal
fact. What are the effects upon the response to light during tetanisation ? What
are the effects during and after tetanisation upon a retinal response of the third
stage ? Is the alteration due to an augmentation of electromotive force or to a dimi-
nution of resistance, or to both factors concurrently ?

I have to some extent investigated all these several points, but in so doing have
become involved in a group of considerations that are, in my opinion, important to
further study of the electrical activity of the retina, but that cannot be fully disengaged
from their non-physiological concomitants without considerable care and labour.

The case stands thus :—In addition to the alterations of response to light, there
are produced in the living eyeball in consequence of electrical excitation—(1) An
