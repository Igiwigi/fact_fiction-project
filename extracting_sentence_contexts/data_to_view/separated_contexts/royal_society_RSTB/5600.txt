In one
sense distribution may be eliminated, in that the genus Molgula possesses species in
both north and south hemispheres, in polar and tropical waters, in shallow shore regions
and deep-sea basins and, as may be seen from Table I, there is no connection between
such distribution and the occurrence of anural development. There is left distribution of another kind, namely, the type of habitat, rather than
its geographical and bathymetrical range. In this connection there appears a fact of
possibly great significance, that whereas all compound ascidians and the Ascidiide,
Cionidee, Styelidee and Pyuride are typically attached firmly to stones, rock, wood,
etc., and only one or two isolated cases are known where this is not so, of the 52 species
of Molgulids here investigated, 31 are unattached and live free in sand, mud or shell-
gravel (see Table I). Moreover, the average size of the free-living forms is about three
times that of the attached forms, and the former are typically oviparous, as distinct
from the latter. The free forms usually become embedded in the sand and anchored more or less firmly
by means of the very numerous extensions of the test to which sand grains adhere.
