Straight copies like da
Vinciâ€™s are illuminating in that they are rarely workable, and highlight the need
for understanding of the underlying engineering principles. These principles must
be understood before the correct application area in manufactured technology can
be identified and exploited. For example, bat or bird-like wings are of no use for
human-sized flight but in fact may find use with the smaller flying robots (micro air
vehicles (MAVs)) currently in development. There is a duality between engincering
and biology which, although not immediately obvious, has considerable practical
value; they are both optimized (capital cost and fitness, respectively). More modern attempts at biomimetics have transferred elements of designs rather
than simply seeking to make a direct simulacrum.
