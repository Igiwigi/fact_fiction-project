Therefore it occurs to me, and the author whose terms I have just used will, I be-
lieve, agree with me in this view, namely, that these Edentata are the direct children
of the Prototheria. That they passed through a Metatherian stage is a thing nob to
be controverted, but I believe that it was not, in most cases at least, utilizedâ€”ib was
an abbreviated prenatal stage ; they lost their Marsupial bones and never acquired
any Marsupial modification of their abdominal skin. A great satisfaction now arises
to me from the fact that my very narrow line of research brings me to the reiteration
of Professor FLowER's views of the Edentata, inter 8e. The Old World types are sharply divided from those of the New World ; but types
80 different in appearance and habits as the Sloth and the Ant-bear can be 8hown by
embryology, as well as by their general anatomical structure, to be, in reality, closely
related. Adaptive modification has done its utmost in these two cages ; but it has
only masked, it has not destroyed, the essential fundamental conformity of these two
grotesque and aberrant types of Mammals.
