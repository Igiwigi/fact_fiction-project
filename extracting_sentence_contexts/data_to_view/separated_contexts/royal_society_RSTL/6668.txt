the physiological conditions haye been such as to require available Nitrogen, and

must therefore have been more or less favourable to the assimilation of free Nitrogen,
provided such assimilation were possible. Tence, the fact that this did not take place

combined Nitrogen upon the growth of the Graminaceze, apply also, in a greater or
less degree, to the other plants experimented npon..
