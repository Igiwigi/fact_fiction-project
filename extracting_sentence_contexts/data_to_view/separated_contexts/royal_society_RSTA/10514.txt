If, however, ¢ be not too large, so that we can suppose ue sensibly zero throughout,

* September 13, 1902. I have, since writing the above, verified that a solution for rectangular beams
does exist, which fulfils rigidly these conditions. It is, in fact, identical with part of CLEBscn’s solution
for a thick plate. BEAM OF RECTANGULAR CROSS-SECTION UNDER ANY SYSTEM OF LOAD. 67

then the mean values U, V taken across the breadth of the beam of the displace-
ments w, v in the plane zy are found to satisfy two differential equations of the same
form as the equations of elasticity when the displacements are independent of z
and w= 0, with this change, that the elastic constant is replaced by another
constant ’. The mean stresses in the plane of xy are found by differentiation from

U and V by similar formule to those giving xz, yy, ry in terms of wu, v for two-
dimensional strain.
