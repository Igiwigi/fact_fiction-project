P{9 (E’) < 0,° < 6 (E’)|E} =«,

we see at once that it contradicts the assumption that 6,° is constant. In fact, on
this assumption, whatever the fixed point E’ and the values 0 (E’) and 0 (E’), the
only values the probability (19) may possess are zero and unity. For this reason we
shall drop the specification of the problem as given by the condition (19).

Returning to the inequalities (18), we notice that while the central part, 0,°, is a
constant, the extreme parts 0 (E’) and 6 (E’) are particular values of random
variables. In fact, the coordinates of the sample point E are the random variables
(4), and if @ (E) and 6 (E) are single-valued functions of E, they must be random
variables themselves.

Therefore, whenever the functions @ (E) and 6 (E) are defined in one way or
another, but the sample point E is not yet fixed by observation, we may legitimately
discuss the probability of @ (E) and 6 (E) fulfilling any given inequality and in
particular the inequalities analogous to (18), in which, however, we must drop
the dashes specifying a particular fixed sample point E’. We may also try to select
6 (E) and 6 (E) so that the probability of 6 (E) falling short of 0,° and at the same
time of 6 (E) exceeding 6,°, is equal to any number « between zero and unity, fixed
in advance. If 0,° denotes the true value of 0,, then of course this probability must
be calculated under the assumption that 0,° is the true value of 0,. Thus we can
