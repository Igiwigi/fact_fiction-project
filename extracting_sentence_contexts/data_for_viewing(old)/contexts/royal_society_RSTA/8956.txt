m= 10. No F, found, but 31726-38 as F, and 31841-05 as (—8,)F; gives F, the same value 31625°5.
This gives a mean limit = 30676°75.

The evidence seems therefore clear for the existence of this type of series.
The Value of the Oun.—For the evaluation of the oun there are at disposal :—

(1) The A,, A, as determined from the S separations. These have given (p. 346) for

a first approximation to 6, the value 249°30 from », and 249°6 from the two alternative

v's, . The vs are so ill-determined that these might possibly refer to values giving

the same 6. But the fact that the value of ¢ calculated from A, agrees so closely

with the maximum ordinate in the corresponding oceurrency curve (Plate 2, fig. 1)

shows that A, must be exceedingly close to the true value, in which case it is

improbable that the °3 difference in é could be attributed to a single observation error
on each of A’, Ay As it has been shown in [IIL p. 332] that the triplet separation
always shows a slight difference in the 4 from »j, 12, it is probable that the same occurs
