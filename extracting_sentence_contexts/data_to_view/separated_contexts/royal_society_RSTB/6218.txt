The increase in the length of the skull is made up of akout 42% in the
increase in the nose anterior to the orbits, 35°, in the region between the pineal
foramen and the front of the orbits, and 23°%, between the pineal and the back of the
parietal crest. Also while the length has increased by about 35% the width has
increased by about 50%. Restorations in side view are much less satisfactory owing to the fact that the
majority of skulls have been crushed. Specimens H and F are very little distorted,
however, and a fairly reliable restoration can be made of specimen C, fig. 4.

It will be seen from this series that the canine tooth occupies a constant position,
and the post-canines remain close to it and do not occupy a much greater space in the
old specimens than they do in the young.
