Certain oxides which are not
themselves reduced, can unquestionably act in this manner; and it is bighly probable
therefore that those which are reduced, and which belong to the same class of bodies,
have the same property. On this view therefore the law of the formation of the
oxygen is ever one and the same, and 80 far as relates to the chemical action of the
peroxide of barium on the metallic oxide this is ever definite. The fact therefore
which is expressed by the series of ratios is by no means any different forms of com-
bination of the particles of the oxygen with each other, but simply the way in which the
decomposition of the peroxide of barium is distributed between these different modes of
action, and the relative velocity with which these two modes of decomposition take
place. If, for example, the ratio of the loss of oxygen from the peroxide of barium to
that from the metallic oxide, be as 4 : 1, three parts of the peroxide of barium will have
been decomposed by the contact and one by the chemical action; if the ratio be as 2 : 1,
the decomposition will have taken place in equal proportions between the two. All
the phenomena are perfectly consistent with this view.
