these two species occur together for a short period at two separate seasons of the year. These
are during September to November and from April to June. During the first of these,
Lucilia populations are disappearing from the arena very rapidly and are at a low ebb,
while C. albiceps populations are beginning to make their first appearance. During the
second period, the positions are reversed and Lucilia is commencing to increase in numbers
rapidly while C. albiceps is decreasing and is already on the point of fading out. Unlike the
Lucilia-C. chloropyga combination, in which only those two species occur together, the over-
lapping populations of Lucilia and C. albiceps are rarely free from the intervention of a third
species. Either C. marginalis or C. chloropyga is usually present on the carcass at the same
time, so that it will be on comparatively rare occasions that a straightforward competition
between Lucilia and C. albiceps will take place.

Apart from the fact that these occasions do arise, we require to know the separate effects
of C. albiceps on each of the species. This fly is the only one of the blowflies, co-existent on
carcasses in South Africa, which is both predatory and cannibalistic. Its relationships will
therefore differ from those of the more docile species. Some of the peculiarities arising from
these habits were seen in the study of the intraspecific competition.

(i) Mortality in the mixed population. The data for Lucilia and C. albiceps respectively are
rendered comparable with each other and with those for the same two species in the intra-
specific competition series by expressing the total initial larval population and the surviving
C. albiceps population in terms of Lucilia, The total mortality in the mixed population has
been calculated on this basis.

The mortality in the two larval populations is plotted in figure 29. The extremely rapid
