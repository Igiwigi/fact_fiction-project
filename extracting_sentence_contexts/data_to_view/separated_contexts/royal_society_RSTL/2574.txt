From one of the experiments (No. 4.) just mentioned, it is manifest that the
precipitation of chloride of barium by nitrate of silyer does not involve any
appreciable source of error. To be quite certain, however, as to this fact,
chloride of barium was mixed with nitrate of silver in excess, and the precipi-
tate carefully washed. It was then boiled in distilled water, and the fluid ex-
amined for silyer and baryta ; but not a trace of either could be detected. It
dissolved completely in ammonia, and the addition of sulphuric acid did not
cause the slightest turbidity.
