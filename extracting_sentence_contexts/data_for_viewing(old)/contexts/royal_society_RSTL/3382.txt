that time, investigations into the nervous system have been prosecuted with a success
strongly in contrast with that attending the inquiries during the long period of some
hundred years, in which a false hypothesis had satisfied the minds of the medical
profession, and chained down physiologists in inactivity.

In 1821 I had made s0 much progress in these investigations, that I was encouraged
to present my first paper to the Society, as no longer the expression of mere opinions
founded on experiments too delicate to be generally appreciated, but demonstrations
of substantial facts, easily proved to be correct, and such as the Society has always
sought to encourage. After the principle had been once established by anatomy
and experiment, that the nerves possess distinct functions in correspondence with
their origins from the brain and spinal marrow, time and opportunity were alone
wanting for collecting the pathological facts which were to give importance to the
observations in these early papers. Those facts I am now desirous of placing before
the Society, to complete the subject as far as regards my own labours.

First in regard to

The Spinal Nerves.

In the earliest part of my investigations I performed experiments on the roots of
these nerves. I exposed the spinal marrow, separated the distinct roots, and found
that the anterior root on being irritated excited motion, while the posterior root
did not excite the muscles. By inference, and by comparing the spinal nerves with
those of the encephalon, I was at length led to conclude that the anterior root is
