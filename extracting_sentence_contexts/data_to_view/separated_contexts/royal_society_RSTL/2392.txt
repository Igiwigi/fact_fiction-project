It can hardly be necessary to give any reasons why platina does not show this
effect under ordinary circumstances. It is then not sufficiently clean (617.), and
the gases are prevented from touching it, and suffering that degree of effect which is
needful to commence their combination at common temperatures, and which they can
only experience at its surface. In fact, the very power which causes the combination
of oxygen and hydrogen is competent, under the usual casual exposure of platina, to
condense extraneous matters upon its surface, which soiling it, take away for the time
its power of combining oxygen and hydrogen by preventing their contact with it.

633. Clean platina, by which I mean such as has been made the positive pole of a
pile (570.), or has been treated with acid (605.), and has then been put into distilled
water for twelve or fifteen minutes, has a peculiar friction when one piece is rubbed
against another.
