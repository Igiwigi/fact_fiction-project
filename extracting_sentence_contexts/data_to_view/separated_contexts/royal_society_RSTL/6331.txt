The intestines and their contents, on the other

Shand, stand in an opposite relation. . Thus, of the entire body of the Pig, these amounted
to about 6 per cent., of that of the Sheep to about 3Z per cent., and of that of Oxen to
Sonly about 24 per cent. These facts are of considerable interest, when it is borne in
d, that in the food of the Ruminant there is 80 large a proportion of indigestible
ZWoody-fibre, and in that of the well-fed Pig a comparatively large proportion of Starch
S=the primary transformations of which are supposed to take place chiefly after leaving
ahe stomach, and more or less throughout the intestinal canal. Again, of the masses of
Snternal *loose fat,‚Äù with its connecting membrane, the Bullocks yielded about 44 per
Fent., the Sheep about 7Z, and the Pig little more than 14 per cent. The Pig, therefore,
"Irith its much less proportion of alimentary organs, has also a much less proportion to the
Sthole body, of the fat which swrrounds them.
