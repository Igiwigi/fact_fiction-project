202 MR. NEWPORT ON THE IMPREGNATION OP

dorsales are proceeding rapidly to meet, and form the median dorsal sulcus of the
growing body. But the corresponding ova in set I had not been carried further than
to the earliest perceptible indications of the area germinativa. These facts sufficiently prove the great influence of temperature on the develop-
ment of the embryo in its earliest stages, as the comparative numerical results do
also its effects on the impregnation of the ovyum. Out of eighteen ova placed in
the higher and increasing temperature, thirteen produced embryos at nearly similar
stages of growth ; while of nineteen ova maintained in a low and diminishing tempe-
rature only eight became segmented, and but three of them arrived at the tadpole
state. A somewhat similar but more marked result took place with the ova of No. 2 in
the two sets of experiments.
