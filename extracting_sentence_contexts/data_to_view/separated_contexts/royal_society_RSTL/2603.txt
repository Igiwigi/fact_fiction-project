In the same manner as before
we may find the absolute weight of S.?, if we assume seven different specific gravities
for U from 7'9 to 8:5, proceeding by 01.

* I have recently met with a piece of cast brass (intended for a pendulum bar) the specific gravity of which
is less than 7:4, —F. Barry,


IMPERIAL STANDARD TROY POUND WEIGHT. 495

We thus obtain for the absolute weight of S.?, if U had its specific gravity,
= 7:9... . 5759-4397 grains troy.
= 80... . 5759-4507
= 8&1... . 57594614 —
= 82... . 57594719 —
= 83... .. 57094821 —
= 84... . 57594921 —
= 85... . 57595018
There remains consequently (if even we snppose U of brass) an uncertainty about its
absolute weight = 5759-5018 — 5759-4397 = 00621 gr., or about 0:06 gr. In fact, though we have five different pounds in excellent preservation, and com-
pared with the lost standard with the greatest care and the best instruments, and
though the number of these comparisons surpasses 600, there remains an uncertainty
of 0:08 gr., or at least 0-06 gr., as tots real weight ; and this solely on account of its
specific gravity and expansion not being known. It is to be hoped that no pound
will in future eyer be declared a legal standard, unless these elements (the knowledge
of which is indispensable even for a single comparison with a good balance) are pre-
viously determined with the greatest possible precision. A standard pound is in-
tended for the purpose of obtaining from it accurate copies; and it therefore involyes
a contradiction if those elements are not well ascertained.
