gave very little gas at either electrode : that at the anode was oxygen, that at the
cathode pure hydrogen. From the cathode also rose a white turbid stream, consisting
of diffused sulphur, which s0on rendered the whole solution milky. The yolumes of
gases were in no regular proportion to the quantities eyolyed from water in the volta-
electrometer, I conclude that the sulphurous acid was not at all affected by the
electric current in any of these cases, and that the water present was the only body
electro-chemically decomposed ; that, at the anode, the oxygen from the water con-
verted the sulphurous acid into sulphuric acid, and, at the cathode, the hydrogen elec-
trically evolved decomposed the sulphurous acid, combining with its oxygen, and
Setting its sulphur free. I conclude that the sulphur at the negative electrode was only
a 8econdary result ; and, in fact, no part of it was found combined with the small por-
tion of hydrogen which escaped when weak solutions of sulphurous acid were used.

757. Sulphuric acid â€”I have already given my reasons for concluding that sul-
phuric acid is not electrolyzable, i. e. not decomposable directly by the electric current,
but occasionally suffering by a secondary action at the cathode from the hydrogen
eyolyed there (681.). In the year 1800, Davy considered the sulphur from sulphuric
acid as the result of the action of the nascent hydrogen +. In 1804, Hisincer and
Berzelaus tated that it was the direct result of the action of the voltaic pile F ; an
opinion which from that time Davy seems to haye adopted, and which has since been
