The current lasted, in the first instance, for 25 minutes, and in the second, for
5 minutes 45 seconds, thus we have for T the value 1845 seconds.

The value of W — V was 1176 for 25 minutes, 1238 for 2°5 minutes, and 1233 for
3°25 minutes.

From these we obtain, as the mean value of W —, V, 1187, and hence V = 4568.

The fact that there was a break in the middle so that four readings of the
chronometer are involved, renders the time measurement less trustworthy than in the
other experiments.

Bowls I. and IV. were used.

Experiment 7, August 12, afternoon.

W changed from 5753 to 5756 during the experiment, the mean value was 5754°5.
The value of W — V was changed after the current had been passing for 5 minutes
from 3349 to 3344, but without breaking the current, the slide being readjusted
to suit. It remained very steady at this value while the experiment lasted. The
whole time of the experiment was 50 minutes 5 seconds.
