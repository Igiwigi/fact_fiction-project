improves in ductility by cooling to low temperatures, and to an even greater extent
than this alloy, No. 5277.

Another of the alloys specially introduced for this research is No. 3754, with 18-8%
chromium and 8-1% nickel. This represents the type of non-rusting and acid-resisting
steel now in most general use, and familiarly known as 18:8. Its elongation at
ordinary temperature is specially high, namely, 56%, and at the lower temperature the
figure remains of quite respectable magnitude, 25Â°. Associated as this is with a
tenacity of no less than 119-8 tons, a combination of high tenacity with excellent
ductility, it presents, in fact, the best result obtained in this research.

Specimen No. 3671, with 0-71% chromium and 3-34%%, nickel, was introduced as
representing a type of high-tenacity steel in general use in the automobile and aircraft
industry. Previous experience Haprrep (loc. cit.) had indicated that steels with
contents of nickel and chromium of this same order retained in liquid air much of their
original ductility, and to an extent rather better than similar nickel steels without
chromium. This is a point of some importance in view of the use of aircraft in the
upper and cold regions of the atmosphere, where brittleness in highly stressed members
would be dangerous. This practical consideration did not, of course, demand investi-
gation at such a low temperature as that of liquid hydrogen, which was made more
for its Scientific interest.
