power, but not their conductivity. If we operate on muscles of frogs which have perished
in nitrous or hydrosulphuric acid, we obtain the same results as from frozen museles.


PROFESSOR MATTEUCCT'S ELECTRO-PHYSIOLOGICAL RESEARCHES. 135

Before quitting this subject, 1 gladly avail myself of this opportunity of mentioning an
important fact discovered by M. Du Bots ReyMoxd. From the period of my earliest re-
searches in electro-physiology, I had vainly endeavoured to obtain electrical phenomena
from the nerves of a living animal, or of one recently killed; and even now it is demonstrated,
that, notwithstanding the use of the most delicate modern galvanometers, no sign of elec-
trical current is to be obtained from a nerve laid bare in a living animal and left in its
natural state, M. Du Bois ReymonD has, nevertheless, demonstrated, and the fact is
easily verified with a very delicate galvanometer, that a piece of nerve detached from a
living animal prepared and disposed in the same way as a half-thigh, in the circuit of the
galvanometer, produces constantly an electric current, which, like that of the muscle, is
directed from the surface of the nerve to the interior in the galvanometer. I have proved,
by experiments made on pieces cut from the lumbar nerves of a frog, that the intensity
of the current of the nerves increases with the number of elements united to form a pile,
and that a pile of five or six of these elements acts on the nerve of a galvanoscopic frog
and excites contractions. I have compared the electromotive power of a muscle with
that of a nerve, both belonging to the same frog. It is hardly necessary to say that this
was done by opposing to a halt-thigh as many nervous elements as were required in order
to there being no differential current. In two experiments I found that one half-thigh
predominated over seven nervous elements, and that nine of the latter predominated over
