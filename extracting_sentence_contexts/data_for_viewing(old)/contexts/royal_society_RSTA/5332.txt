eventually become important. The dynamic topography is especially valuable because it defines
the geostrophic current, which dominates the ocean flow outside frictional boundary layers at
periods longer than a few days [6]. It is because of this relationship that satellite altimetry
measurements of SSH variability have revolutionized our understanding of oceanography,
particularly the role of mesoscale eddies, which act on typical length scales of 10 to a few hundred
kilometres [7], and periods of about 10-200 days [8].

The many oceanographic breakthroughs from altimetric measurements would require an
extensive review article. However, a few examples include the first mapping of global Rossby
wave speeds [9] and the recognition that such waves are swept to the east in the Antarctic
circumpolar current [10,11]; the discovery of alternating zonal jets throughout much of the
ocean [12]; the recognition that much of what had initially been thought of as Rossby waves is
in fact nonlinear eddy variability, and the mapping of the eddy characteristics [13]; recognition
of large-scale changes in the North Atlantic circulation related to the Meridional overturning
circulation [14]; and unravelling of the complex interactions between basin-scale flows, climate
modes, Rossby waves and mesoscale eddies in the North Pacific Ocean ([15] and references
therein). All of these observations have stimulated theoretical development and improved
understanding of the global ocean circulation. Figure 2 (adapted from [19]) shows an example
of what can be learned about eddy-mean flow interaction from satellite altimetry. The shading
represents the eastward acceleration of the mean flow owing to momentum fluxes carried by
time-dependent eddies (measured using altimetry alone), whereas the contours of mean dynamic
topography illustrate the mean flow (for which a geoid measurement is also needed). It had been
thought that eddies radiated out from jets would tend to exert an eastward acceleration on the jets,
but the observations showed a more complicated relationship, indicating that the simple theory
is too idealized to apply to the real Southern Ocean, and suggesting that the interaction of eddies
