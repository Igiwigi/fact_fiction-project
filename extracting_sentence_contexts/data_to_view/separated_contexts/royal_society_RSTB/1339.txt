To sum up, it may be stated that the existence of fibres, following the course
indicated above, is not negatived by any anatomical fact. It has been shown that
just as in the case of the inner fibres of the posterior longitudinal bundle, and the
antero-lateral columnar fibres, there exists a group of unbroken fibres which extend
from the quadrigeminal region into the lateral column of the cord. It has been
shown that these fibres undergo a descending degeneration, and that they must not
be confounded with the fibres of the cerebellar tract, to the inner side of which they
lie.
