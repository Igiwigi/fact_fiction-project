complete, The essential link, that of connection with the posterior roots, the fibres of
which convey afferent impulses, is, however, wanting. It is, notwithstanding, highly
probable that these paths (direct cerebellar and antero-lateral), are to be classed as
afferent from the resemblance in extension of the degeneration to that present in the
fibres of the posterior columns.

There are many considerations connected with growth, development, &c., which
suggest that ascending degeneration is the characteristic of afferent, and descending
degeneration of efferent tracts in the spinal cord; in other words, that the centres of
growth and nutrition are also the centres of functional activity, and, therefore, in
consequence of an interruption, that loss of functional activity and loss of nutrition
both occur in the part on the distal side of the breakdown. The fact, however, that
the cells in the ganglion on the posterior root exercise this nutritive function on the
nerve fibres on both sides, although explicable in consequence of developmental rela-
tions (His) must cause some hesitation as to the propriety of accepting, without
reserve, the principle that the direction of the degeneration coincides with the direc-
tion of the function. What has happened in the development of the posterior root
fibres may possibly have also occurred in the case of some fibres in the cord. More-
over, it is conceivable that even with this relation between nutrition and function,
ascending degenerative changes might occur in fibres which ought to be classed as
outgoing, since they would lie as much on the efferent side of the central nervous
system as do those of the pyramidal tract. Such fibres would be long internuncial
fibres, connecting the kinzsthetic system of the lower (lumbar) centres with the
efferent side of a similar system of the upper (or cervical) region. It is conceivable
