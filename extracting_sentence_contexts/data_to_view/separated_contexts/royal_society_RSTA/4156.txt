In steels containing larger proportions of
carbon, the scale of the granular structure of the “ferrite” diminishes and the
slip-bands become correspondingly minute, requiring the highest powers of the
microscope for their observation. We have not been able to observe anything
of the nature of slip-bands in the dark or “ pearlite” areas of steel, but the
correspondence which has been recognised by OsMoND to exist between the. struc-
ture of “pearlite” and that of typical eutectic alloys, taken with facts to be
described below, points to the possibility that “pearlite” may also yield plastically
by slipping. Slip-bands have also been observed in various specimens of brass and bronze. The behaviour of eutectic alloys under plastic strain is of special interest, because
these bodies apparently differ so widely in structure from pure metals.
