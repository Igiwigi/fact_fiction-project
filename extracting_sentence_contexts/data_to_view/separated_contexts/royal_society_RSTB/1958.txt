Ammonium sulphocyanide we found to exert no effect upon the production of heat
contractions. Thus the action of potassium sulphocyanide favours the view that
heat-contraction is caused by the purely physical precipitation of a proteid by heat. Other facts which also point to the same conclusion are: (1) The heat-contraction
produced in rigor-mortis muscle ; and (2) The contractions produced in fresh muscle
at about 47°C. and 58°C. It is, moreover, probable that the precipitation of the
proteids in one insoluble form during rigor-mortis is the sole physical cause forming
the basis of that contraction. On the other view, viz., that the physical is accompanied by a chemical change
which latter is the true cause of the actual contraction, we have the series of
observations with regard to the production of an acid reaction during heat-
contraction.
