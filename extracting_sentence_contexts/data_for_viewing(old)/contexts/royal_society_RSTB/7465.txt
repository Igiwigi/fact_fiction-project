A few capsules are closed and contain no rock matrix; and these always show many
seeds, but they are so delicate that they are usually broken in small pieces. In figure 26,
plate 19, the dark matter behind the margin proved, under different lighting, to consist
largely of the chalazal ends of megaspores, while the less dark part below this is chiefly
broken pieces of the ‘fibrous membrane’. Figure 10, plate 18, shows a nearly intact but
very small megaspore membrane dissected out of such a capsule; as a rule the megaspore
membranes seem to be 1-0 to 1-5 mm. long.

The specimen in figure 26, plate 19, is not quite fully macerated. It is unusual in that
all its megaspore membranes are of small size, well under 1 mm. long. Below some, and
perhaps all, of the megaspores there is a small dark nodule very like the pollen masses of
the specimen called Microcheiris. Accordingly, it was removed and further macerated, and
it was proved that each was in fact a pollen mass. One of these masses teased out
from the capsule is shown in figure 24, plate 19, and in figure 4B; the others are
similar or a little larger, but the pollen grains composing these masses are so numerous
and so compacted together that it is not possible to trace the outline of any one of them
completely.

The innermost layer of the capsule which is called the fibrous membrane proved trouble-
some to investigate and is by no means understood. After maceration it consists of a soft
material showing very dimly the outlines of several layers of cells. The fibrous membrane
forms a sheath round the chalazal ends of the seeds just as an integument would do, but
it also extends far beyond the apices of the embryo sacs down to near the base of the capsule,
as though it here forms the inner lining of the capsule. The scattered pollen grains in the
capsule are all sticking to this layer.
