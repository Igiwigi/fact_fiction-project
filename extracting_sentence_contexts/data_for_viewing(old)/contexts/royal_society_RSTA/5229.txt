spiky behaviour at low sizes, visual inspection shows, over many pictures, that the background is


almost entirely devoid of any particles in the 40 nm region. Both 20 kV and 5 kV instruments were
used in these measurements. Since the SEM inspects only a very small fraction of the wafer (even
with multiple observation points) sampling is a potential problem. In the case of supercritical
saltwater spray aerosols, even smaller particles were readily identified by SEM [7].

We used the TSI 3080/3081/3776 SMPS to measure the precipitation efficiency of the flow-
through electrostatic precipitator by measuring particle concentration versus bin size in its output
with the precipitation voltage on and off, using salt aerosol. The results strongly suggest that
particles in the 10-40 nm (SMPS) range are precipitated with an efficiency of 96-98%, and those in
the 100-700 nm range better than 90%. The missing particles in the SEM are in fact preferentially
precipitated, enhancing their chance for being observed.

As mentioned earlier, the SMPS provides only indirect measurements, its mobility results
may be influenced by particle shape, preferential orientation, etc., and its results are not always
in agreement with other measurements. However, a very thorough and elaborate experimental : =

analysis of salt particles by Zelenyuk ef al. [20], using a variety of methods, showed that yy
the mobility diameter of single salt particles measured with an SMPS is in good agreement 2
with SEM measurements of these same particles, even for those having multiple charges. This aes
is in agreement with our own, much more limited, observations of single polystyrene latex 72
(PSL) spheres. [4
