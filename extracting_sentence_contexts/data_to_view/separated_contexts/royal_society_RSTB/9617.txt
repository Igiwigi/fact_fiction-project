Area (Beckton-Dickinson), GFP-positive cells from the Ecto-GFP curated 193 NG and 376 NT sequences (available in the electronic
and Endo-GEFP strains [31,45] with a MoFlow Astrios (Beckman supplementary material, table S1), some of them corresponding to
Coulter). The sorted cells (3 x 10° to 6 x 10° cells) were centri- isoforms of the same gene.
