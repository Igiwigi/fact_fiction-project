Since the stable
eigenvalues of UV* are in fact complex (figure 1), we expect an oscillatory approach to UVt
(responsible for the overshoot at the top right corner of the branch in figure 13) but monotonic
growth away from BS. So the presence of large amplitude oscillations away from and then back
to BS is unexpected. In fact, these pulses form by a natural mechanism. From the point of view
of trajectories in four-dimensional phase space a pulse forms when a trajectory departs from
BS, viewed as a saddle point in phase space, follows its unstable manifold towards UV* and
then the unstable manifold of UV* back towards BS. This process may repeat any number of
times.
