S On making a vertical section of the left ventricle between the musculi papillares
(Plate XIE. figs. 13 & 14), the ventricular wall (s), like the ventricular cavity, is observed
Sto form a double cone, the apices of which point towards the apex and base of the yen-
Ztride respectively, the bases, which are united in the upper portion of the middle third,
Seonesponding with the thickest part of the ventricular wall. The varying degree of
ickness in the ventricular wall is traceable to the fact, that the outermost and inner-
:2most layers extend further towards the apex and base than those which come next, and
Sthexe, again, further than those which succeed them, and s0 on until the central layer is
Freachedâ€”this being of least extent, and confined indeed to about the middle third of
Sthe ventricle. 'Thus into the apicial portion of the ventricular wall, where thinnest, only
Zone layer enters, viz. the superficial or first external*.
