How-
ever, the magnitude of the effect does not depend on the
duration of the exposure to adaptation: the effects for stimuli
of 0.25, 1 and 4 s exposure were almost identical. This
event-based numerosity fits well with statistical models of
adaptation in which the dynamic adjustment of perceptual
experiences, based on both the previous experience of the
stimuli and the current percept, acts to optimize the limited
working range of perception, implicating a highly plastic
mechanism for numerosity perception dependent on the
number of discrete adaptation events [29]. The fact that brief periods of adaptation were sufficient to
elicit large changes in apparent numerosity allowed us to
study the neural effects of adaptation, using functional mag-
netic resonance imaging (fMRI) techniques. Castaldi ef al.
[30] recorded the BOLD responses to various numerosities
from intraparietal sulcus (IPS) and V1 in human observers,
before and after they had adapted to an 80-dot stimulus. The
authors trained a classifier to discriminate the numerosity of
dot clouds before and after adaptation.
