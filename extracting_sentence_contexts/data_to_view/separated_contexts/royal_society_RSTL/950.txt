Now, if the metal were oxi-
dated previous to its solution, the oxygen, there is reason to
think, would be derived from the nitrous acid, and the grey
oxide formed by this acid, be produced, which can scarcely

be the case, as it is insoluble in aqua regia. Add to this, the
fact, that by evaporating a common solution of platinum to
dryness, no nitrate can be obtained, but only a muriate, or a
compound of the metal and chlorine,

If, according to the statements of Professors VavQueLIN and
BxRzEL1vs, the black oxide of platinum contains about 15 per
cent. of oxygen, the grey oxide may be considered as the
protoxide, containing 1 proportion, and the black oxide 15
proportion of oxygen; and the number representing the
element or proportion in which platinum combines with bo-
dies will be 126, taking Sir H. Davy's number 15, to repre-
sent the proportion in which oxygen unites with bodies. Mr. Cooyrr states the black oxide of platinum to consist
of 100 platinum, with only 4317 of oxygen;*
