'THE development of the Myriapoda has hitherto been only partially investigated.
It is, nevertheless, a subject of great importance to the comparative anatomist, from
the remarkable fact that it takes place in a manner entirely different from that of
most of the higher Articulata, to some of which the Myriapoda are closely allied both
in habits and structure. The true Insecta arrive at their perfect state by an aggre-
gation or apparent diminution in the number of their segments, but the Myriapoda,
on the contrary, by a repeated increase of these parts, which in many instances are
multiplied to several times their original number. This addition of segments,
during the growth of the animal, occurs throughout the whole class, and is one of its
chief characteristics. This fact was first noticed long ago by Deczxs, but since the
period of his obseryations nothing further was added to our knowledge until it was
fully confirmed by the careful investigations of Sav1, and also by the more recent
labours of Braxpr, Gervais, and Waga. But excellent as are the observations of
these naturalists, some of the most important cireumstances connected with them
have been entirely overlooked, both as regards the condition of the embryo on leaving
