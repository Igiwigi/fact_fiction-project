to indicate the affinity with Asterochlena lara, which he was describing at the same
time. ScHenK, on the other hand, having only the petioles at his disposal, referred
his fossil to the artificial genus Rachiopteris, although he recognised the resemblance
with Clepsydropsis. His figure of the specimen is inaccurate. Not only is the orientation
of the petiolar strands quite different from that shown in the figure, but even the contour
of the specimen is incorrectly drawn. It does seem strange that, having originally had
in his possession a complete slab like that of SrenzeL, ScuENK should have given away
to Lance the more important half, which included the stem. Had Scuenx figured
the entire slab, his sketch would have been so similar to Srenzev’s figure at the adjoining
fragment, that the relation of the two specimens with each other would not so long have
remained obscure.

We need not go into details over the structural facts described by Scuunk and
SrenzeL. STENzEL’s fig. 38, Plate IV, is a remarkably good sketch of the upper face
of the slab (level 31 mm. in text-fig. 1); he correctly draws the outline of the leaf-
bearing stem with the decurrent leaf-bases, including the fragments of the stele marked
sg, sq’ in his figure. The leaf-traces in the cortex are merely shown as dots.+ In one of
the free petioles{t he shows a strand with a slight adaxial curvature ; this is an error,
for none of the leaf-strands ever show any curvature. The petiole marked 6 in his figure
has only a single strand in the appendage on the left, not a pair, as indicated in the
sketch.§ For the rest, the figure is remarkably faithful to the original.

From ScuEenxk’s type-specimen three thin sections (two longitudinal sections and a
partial transverse section) appear to have been made, and ScuENK probably examined
these, for he refers to such microscopic details as root-hairs and scalariform thickenings
