j. The presence of vestigial acromial, procoracoid, and acrocoracoid processes.

k. The fact that the skeleton of the fore-limb is that of a true wing in Stage F
(p. 94; Plate 17, fig. 256).

1. The early assumption of undoubted avian characters in the pelvis (p. 98).

m. The typically avian characters, both as to structure and development, of the
vertebral column and hind-limb.

n. The fact that the brain passes through a typical avian stage with lateral optic lobes
(p. 109; Plate 19, figs. 308 and 309).

o. The relations of the subclavius muscle (p. 90; Plate 19, fig. 293).

The following characters indicate derivation from a more generalised type than
existing Birds :—~
