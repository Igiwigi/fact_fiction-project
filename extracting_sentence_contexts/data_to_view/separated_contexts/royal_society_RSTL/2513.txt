HoumBorpr most truly says, that in judging of temperature, nothing is more deceit-
ful than the testimony of the senses: we can judge of the difference of climates only
by numerical calculations. Having felt the full force of this dictum, I have thought
it necessary to expatiate fully on the meteorology of Dukhun ; and it now only re-
mains for me to show how far the preceding numerical indications are coincident
with salubrity of climate. This point I shall illustrate by a few facts equally brief
and satisfactory. I was six years and one month in Dukhun employed in my sta-
tistical labours : my followers in the field, with their families, always exceeded one
hundred persons, and in monsoon quarters the number was rarely below forty. During the whole period, and amongst such a number of persons, there was not a
single casualty of an adult, and only one of an infant shortly after its birth ; and but
one case of disease that I could not cure myself without professional aid,â€”a degree
of healthiness which probably few other countries can equal.
