Sudden decreases in total resistance are clearly linked to current shocks, which disrupt the concentration polarization layer 1

build-up, which is then resumed until the next current shock. The compounded error of the resistance values is estimated at
25%. (Online version in colour.)

(d) Numerical analysis

As the experimental conditions in the present work fall close to or within the region of EDL
overlap, the simplified solution for F=1 reported in equation (1.11) cannot be applied to the
present case and, in fact, does not accurately reflect experimental data. Therefore, equation (1.4)
has to be used, with a calculated solution for F. This was done considering the full, nonlinear
P-B equation (1.6) and the linearized one equation (1.7). The former was solved numerically,
while for the latter the exact solution in equation (1.8) was used. Finally, equation (1.5) was
integrated numerically. A solution for the numerical resolution of the nonlinear P-B equation has
been constructed via the following steps:

— equation (1.6) has been collocated in equispaced points;

— the differential operators have been discretized via finite differences of order 2;

— boundary conditions were imposed in strong form; and
