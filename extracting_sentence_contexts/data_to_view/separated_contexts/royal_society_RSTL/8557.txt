Pa Fx Gt f=L,

the equation having in each case a positive root which is called 9. The properties of
the equation are the same in each case ; but for the sphere, the equation being a quadric
one, can be solyed. The equation in fact is

P-UC+—f)—&f*=0,

and the positive root is therefore

=HO+&f—FP + (O+2—f)Y +46 f*}-

Suppose e to gradually diminish and become =0; for an exterior point, z >f, the
value of the radical is =z*—f*, and we have =z*—f*; for an interior point, »<F, the

Pte?

value of the radical, supposing e only indefinitely small, is =f* —E Foe @, and we

2 2 s
have 0=þe(1 +ES); =o or, what is the same thing, F=(1 —s); viz. the
Positive root of the equation continually diminishes with e, and becomes ultimately =0. If x or & be indefinitely large, then the radical may be taken =#+z?, and we have
0 indefinitely large, =#+z*.
