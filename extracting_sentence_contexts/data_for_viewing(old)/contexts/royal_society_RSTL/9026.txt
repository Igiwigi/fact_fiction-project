instances, one like that observed by Prof. HuxLey, have since come to light. In one of
them a minute orifice remained after the supposed sealing of the tube. The other case
was noticed when the tubes were returned from the 'Turkish Bath. One of them con-
tained a luxuriant mycelium. It was noticed that the liquid in this tube had singularly
diminished in quantity, and on turning the tube up it was found cracked at the bottom.

No case of pseudo-spontaneous generation ever occurred under my hands that was not
to be accounted for in an equally satisfactory manner.

In this inquiry, thus far, I have confined my observations to purely liquid infusions,
purposely excluding milk, mixtures of turnip-juice and cheese, and, indeed, mixtures of

* « We have ample facts of experiment in our hands,” said Mr. KxowsLex Trwonxtox (Trans. of the Patho-
logical Society, vol. xvi. p. 313), © toshow that it is not the gases of the air, or any soluble material in water, but
something * particulate * which sets up all the train of changes in an open wound, which may, after the patient
has passed through a period of more or less constitutional disturbance, end in the healing of the wound, or may
end in septicemia and death. This particulate material, then, TI believe we have evidence enough to prove
consists of germs of Bacteria and other low organisms.” All the evidence points to this conclusion. I may
say that I entirely agree with Mr. Tmorxrox in the distinction he draws between germs and developed Bacteria
floating in the air. Tt is, in my opinion, of the yery last importance to seize this distinetion with clearness.
When it is fully realized we 8hall probably hear less of the arguments against Bacterial contagia founded
on the fact that a virus diminishes in strength as the Bacteria multiply. A portion of the energy of tho virus
consists in its passage from the germ state to that of tho finished organism.
