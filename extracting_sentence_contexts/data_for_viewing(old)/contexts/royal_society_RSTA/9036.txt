anew. A new “ equation of transfer,” which is different in form from that of Maxwext,
forms the basis of the method, and seems to provide a simpler and more direct means
of calculating the rate of change of molecular properties by collision than has been used
hitherto. This equation, together with Bonrzmann’s equation, readily provide a
solution of the distribution function to any desired degree of completeness.

The kinetic theory of rarefied gases was first considered by Maxwett,t who dealt
as before only with his particular model. The mathematics was thus greatly simplified,
and he was able (legitimately, though without proof) to assume a velocity distribution
function containing terms of the first, second and third degrees only. By this means
he showed that stresses are set up in a gas by non-uniformity of temperature: in a
normal gas these stresses are negligible, but in a rarefied gas their magnitude becomes
appreciable.§ MaxweE.t suggested that this fact might provide a possible explanation
of the phenomena of the radiometer.
