Figure 4. Comparison of different estimators for the number of clusters in the misspecified example of Rajkowski [157], where
the true clustering contains only a single cluster under the uniform kernel. The DP mixture of Gaussians is considered for model-
based clustering with different choices of the concentration parameter a. The box plots display variability in the estimates across
the 50 replicated datasets, with colour corresponding to a sample size of n = 100, 200 or 500. (a) Marginal mode of k. (6) MAP
clustering. (c) Binder clustering. (d) VI clustering. (Online version in colour.)

we, however, empirically observe a different behaviour when incorporating uncertainty on the
within cluster variance. In fact, the MAP clustering (figure 4b) contains only a single cluster in
almost all replicates and is robust to the choice of a. Again, the marginal posterior on k (figure 4a)
and the Binder clustering (figure 4c) are quite sensitive to the value of a, with the Binder clustering
extremely overestimating the number of clusters for larger n and w. The VI clustering (figure 4d)
contains only a single clustering in some replications, and in others contains two to four clusters,
particularly for larger sample sizes. The former can be explained by the fact that the VI solution is
obtained by minimizing a function of the posterior similarity matrix, and as each posterior sample
corresponds to an arbitrary partition of the data points into convex sets, each pair of data points
may have a relatively high probability of being clustered together.

These examples highlight that the choice of estimator can greatly affect the number of clusters
and clustering solution. In fact, while most asymptotic theory focuses on the behaviour of the
marginal posterior on the number of clusters, quite a different behaviour is observed when
