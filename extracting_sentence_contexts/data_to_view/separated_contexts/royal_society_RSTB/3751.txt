No growth-change
takes places as the cones become functional, the scales remaining closely adpressed,
and there is no internodal extension in the axis. The protrusion of the “stylar
tube” does no more than lift the extreme edge of the subtending bract of each
flower, so that there is nothing that can be classed as mechanism in the cone-
structure. Hooker(1864) was so struck by this fact that he assumed that pollination
must take place when the cones were very small, no bigger than the staminate ones ;
the case of Pinus probably affording the suggestion.
