This is a
point of view also shared by Stylianides et al. [3], who stress the role proof can play
in emphasizing the logic of mathematics instead of the authority of the teacher or the
textbook. Nevertheless, as Knuth [13,14] points out, the central role assigned to proof in mathematics
and in mathematicians’ practice is not present in school mathematics. As the author states, in
school, the role of proof has been a peripheral one. ‘This absence of proof in school mathematics
has not gone unnoted and, in fact, has been a target of criticism’ [13, p. 61]. And one of the reasons
usually pointed out by critics is that it can give the students a wrong idea about the nature of the
mathematics [13,14]. As Schoenfeld [15, p. 76] states, proof is a fundamental part of ‘doing, communicating, and
recording mathematics’ and it is not possible to turn it into a separate part of the mathematics,
as usually happens in school.
