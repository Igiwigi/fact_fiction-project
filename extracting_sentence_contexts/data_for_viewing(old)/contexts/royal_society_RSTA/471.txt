balanced economy of nature. Towards the end of his life, he detected a ‘regular graduation’,
from most pure to least pure, of dephlogisticated air, common air, phlogisticated air and
nitrous air, and suggested ‘all these kinds of air differ chiefly in the quantity of phlogiston they
contain’ [19, p. 179]. Whatever status or function Priestley ascribed to phlogiston, he never
lost sight of its hypothetical nature and its inferior epistemological status vis-a-vis the facts
it unearthed.

Priestley’s associationist view of the passivity of the knowing mind, bereft of preconceived
opinion and attuned to the deterministic structure of nature, established ‘facts’, or congeries
of ‘sensible properties’, as completely determined by external reality [23, pp. 348-357,
374-380]. Hypotheses about the underlying causes—such as chemical compositions or
reaction mechanisms—of these sensible properties and their modifications threatened, if
not clearly distinguished from the facts of the matter, to sully objective knowledge with
mere opinion, subtle bias or outright dogma. For Priestley, the fundamental business of



the natural philosopher, and the bedrock of his pneumatic inquiries, consisted of the
heuristic deployment of hypotheses in the proliferation and accumulation of enough facts to
allow, at some future date, the induction of a ‘general theory’ to which they are reduced
[10, vol. 2, p. vii; 18, Part IIL, pp. 153-157].

The distinction tween facts and hypotheses influenced the narrative style of ‘Observations’.
Priestley [30, pp. ii-xx, 576-577; 18, Part 1, pp. 36-39] developed the ‘analytical and historical
style’ of writing in his earlier work in electricity and its history, for which he was elected
