In a paper published in ‘ Acta Mathematica,’ vol. 16, M. Forte announces the fact
that the latitude of places on the earth’s surface is undergoing periodic changes in a
period considerably in excess of that which theory has hitherto been supposed to
require. This result has been confirmed in a remarkable manner by Dr. 8S. C.
CHANDLER in America (vide ‘ Astronomical Journal,’ vols. 11, 12), who, as the result of
an exhaustive examination of almost all the available records of latitude observations
for the last half-century, has assigned 427 days as the true period in which the
changes are taking place.

The old theory, based on the assumption that the earth was rigid throughout, led
to a period of 305 days, and M. Forie proposes to account for the extension of this
period by attributing a certain amount of freedom to the internal portions of the
earth. The earth he supposes to be composed of “a solid shell moving more or less
