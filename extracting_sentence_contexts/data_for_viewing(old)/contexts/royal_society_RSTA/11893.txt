37. Herne has proposed* to define the function P,, («) for complex values of n and p,
by means of the expression

Pau) = 2 (ut Va 1 008)

It will appear from what we have shown in Arts, 33-36, that this definition is not a
valid one, as the function given by the definite integral for values of » with a negative
real part is not the analytical continuation of the function given by the same definite
integral for values of yw with a positive real part ; it follows that P, (u) can be defined
by the above expression only for values of » with a positive real part.

The fact that the definite integral is of ambiguous meaning at the imaginary p axis
is clear if we attend to the phases of the integrand (1 + ./,? — 1 cos )", or h"; » being
purely imaginary there is a value of between 0 and a for which h vanishes, and in
passing through this value of w the phase of the integrand changes by a finite amount.

The / integral in Art. 33 is taken along a path joining z, = which has the point h = 0
on the left hand side, thus for purely imaginary values of » the path may be placed

Zz

ly

as in the figure, with a semi-cireular portion to avoid the point h = 0; we thus see
