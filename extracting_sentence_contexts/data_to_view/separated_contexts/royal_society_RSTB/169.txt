PARKER ON THE STRUCTURE AND DEVELOPMENT

Barpevesen, Krnrer, and others, in Amphibians, Reptiles, and even Mammals
(b) a cartilage to the ulnar side of the third digit, which probably is a remnant of #
aborted fourth digit ; and (c) certain cartilages of more doubtful nature developed i
connection with the index finger, to its ulnar side, and afterwards fusing with it. Lastly, I have made new observations on the small distal phalanges in the Fowl
other Birds, and on the rudimentary nails or claws of the second and third digits ; an
IT have added a short revision of the structure of the wing through the Ratite. Since GragenBaur* spoke the last weighty word upon the structure of the Birdâ€™
wing, no new facts have transpired to make us re-open the question of the homologies
of the three digits with the pollex, index, and medius of other groups. Nothing in
skeleton, the muscles, or the development of the limb contradicts this acceptation,
the best of my knowledge. I take it for granted accordingly in this paper.t
