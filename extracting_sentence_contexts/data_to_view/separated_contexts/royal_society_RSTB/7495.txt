Collectively they may be described as the ‘marginal reaction

rate matrix’. When there are M morphogens this matrix consists of M? numbers. A marginal

* reaction rate has the dimensions of the reciprocal of a time, like a radioactive decay rate,

which is in fact an example of a marginal (nuclear) reaction rate. With these assumptions the equations can be rewritten as
dx,
ry > ax, + by, + K(X 41 —2x,+%,_1),

Pe = oh, +d, +VY p41 — Ye + Yy-1)-

To solve the equations one introduces new co-ordinates £5, ...,§y—1 aNd Moy -++> Iy—1 by

putting N-1 i
