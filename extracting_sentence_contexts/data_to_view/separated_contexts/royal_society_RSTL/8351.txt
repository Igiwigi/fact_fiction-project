My cabinet contains nearly fifty sections of these fruits, and L
Â© have examined others in the cabinets of my friends. That the sporangia of these
strobili adhere to the sporangiophores in a manner closely resembling those of the
modern Fquisetacec, as pointed out by Mr. CARRUTHERS, is undoubtedly true; and,
assuming the Calamites to be Zquisetacew, the above fact might be deemed a strong
confirmation of the conclusion arrived at by the above observers. Mr. CarRruTHERs, in
addition, thinks that he sees elaters attached to the spores, which conclusion, if true,
would be an important additional fact pointing in the same direction.
