290 MR. PRESTWICH ON THE GEOLOGY OF THE DEPOSITS

the valleys proceeded with greater energy in consequence of successive increments in
the mean annual temperature of each succeeding year, let us consider what other
effects might have resulted from the operation of these causes.

The mean annual rainfall of the South-east of England and the North of France is
24 inches. The chief fall is in autumn, and the greater portion of it is carried off as it -
falls; and there is rarely any large accumulation of winter snow. 'This fall is 80 small
that it requires but a moderate excess in the fall of any one period of the year to
produce floods which cover the whole breadth of the present valley-channels. Tt
was a fall of only 3% inches* in the twenty-four hours that caused the disastrous floods
of Morayshire and Aberdeenshire in 1829. Amongst the other remarkable facts con-
nected with that event, Sir T. Diox LavpeRfF states that at Invercauld the 8mall river
Dee rose 144 feet above the usual level, and spread 400 yards wide. A tributary stream
cut away 6000 square yards of gravel, and spread the debris oyer thirty acres of land,
Lower down, at Maryfield, the Dee rose 25 feet aboye its ordinary level. At Park the
rise was 13 feet, and the breadth of the inundation not less than half a mile}. At
Murtle the river changed its channel from one side of the valley to the other, and acres
of land were covered with gravel brought down from the upper parts of the river, The
*indhorn rose in one place 50 feet, and in another place cut * a new channel for itself
for at least a quarter of a mile‚Äù $. Although, owing to the difference in the geological
nature of the ground, the effects of such an exceptional rainfall in the south of England
would be less than in Morayshire, it would not require any extravagant addition to the
small rainfall of the present day to increase both the permanent yolume and the floods
