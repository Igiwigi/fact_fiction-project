MORPHOLOGY OF THE TEETH OF ORNITHORHYNCHUS 401

evidence either for or against the tritubercular theory because of the evidently secondary
and largely degenerative changes which they have undergone; they bear evidence of
descent from a more primitive regularly cuspidate condition.”’ A little later he goes
on: “It is especially noteworthy (1) that unlike the Multituberculates the lower molars

reverse the pattern of the upper molars (as in tritubercular teeth generally) and (2) that
the highest cusps are on the inner side of the upper molars and on the outer side of the

lower molars. So far as these facts are of value they would support the hypothesis that

these are degenerate tritubercular teeth.” The last sentence is in italics.

AMEGHINO (1908) attempted to relate the monotremes to the edentates.

ABEL (1926) has recently emphasized the relationship of the monotremes to the
multituberculates in his description of Desmostylus, a Miocene mammal, which he
claims is related to both these groups. On p. 136 he says, “‘Ich habe im Jahre 1922
wahrscheinlich zu machen versucht, dass wir in Desmostylus einen Angehérigen des
Multituberkulatenstammes zu erblicken haben. Mit dieser Auffassung steht allerdings
in Zusammenhang, dass ich die Multituberkulaten als mit den Monotremen in engstem
genetischen Zusammenhang stehend betrachte, so dass Multituberkulata und Mono-
