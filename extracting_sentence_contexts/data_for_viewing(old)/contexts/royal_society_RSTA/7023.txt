£One concludes that either the second-order corrections should not be applied or that some
unknown systematic error is present of approximately the same magnitude but of opposite
sign. In either case the r.m.s. difference is 4-7-0 mgals; this may indicate an uncertainty of
Bab -0 mgals in each observation or greater accuracy at the deeper, with a corresponding re-
Sduction i in accuracy at the shallower and more perturbed position. It is hard to see how long-
Eperiod horizontal and vertical accelerations can fail to affect the mean period of the pendu-
"clums, and one is therefore forced to consider the other possible causes of systematic error.

s (a) Sway correction
“The shallower stations show greater perturbations of the centre pendulum record which
2 indicates that sway of the support is taking place. However, the fictitious pendulums are in
antiphase, and hence the changes in their periods should show opposite signs. Reference to
Acolumn 9 of table 2 shows that the observed differences at the shallow stations are not
abnormal, and one concludes that sway cannot be the cause. This is confirmed by the
observations made while lying alongside at Oban, where the perturbation of the centre
pendulum was very marked and yet the values of gravity obtained were in good agreement
with those previously observed on land (see § 3-4).

(b) Vibration of support

It is quite probable that some vibration of the support did occur during the observations,
and it is possible that accelerations so developed, whose period would be short compared
with the pendulum period, might give rise to second-order effects tending to make the ob-
