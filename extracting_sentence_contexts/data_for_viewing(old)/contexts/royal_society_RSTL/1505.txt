68 Mr. Davy's Experiments on

That nitrogene is not a metal in the form of gas, is almost
demonstrated by the nature of the fusible substance from am-
monia, and (eyen supposing no reference to be made to the
experiments detailed in this paper,) the general analogy of
chemistry would lead to the notion of its being compounded.

Should it be established by Å¿uture researches that hydro-
gene is a protoxide of ammonium, ammonia a deutoxide, and
nitrogene a tritoxide of the same metal, the theory of chemis-
try would attain a happy simplicity, and the existing arrange-
ments would harmonize with all the new facts. The class of
pure inflammable bases, would be metals capable of alloying
with cach other, and of combining with protoxides. Some of
the bases would be known only. in combination, those of sul-
phur, phosphorus,* and of the boracic, fluoric, and muriatic
acids ; but the relations of their compounds would lead to the

* The electrization of sulphur and phosphorus, goes far to prove that they contains
combined hydrogene. From the phanomena of the action of potassium upon them in
my first experiments, | conceived that they contained oxygene, though as I have stated
in the appendix to the last Bakerian lecture, the effects may be explained on a different
supposirion. The vividness of the ignition in the process, appearedan evidencein favour
of their containing oxygene, till I discovered that similar phznomena were produced
