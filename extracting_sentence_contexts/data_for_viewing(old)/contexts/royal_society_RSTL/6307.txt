and gravels. Probably of the same age, and much resembling the Hoxne deposit in
many of its details*, are the deposits at Mundesley, Copford, Lexden, and others in the
South of England. They were all formed before the country had assumed exactly its
present form of surface,—before all its variety of hill and dale had been fashioned to
their present shape. Even should the exact position of the worked flints at Hoxne prove
to be above all the bone-bearing beds, and not in them, still that they are contem-
poraneous with an old condition of surface, and that over the whole is spread a drift
concomitant with a modification of that surface, and giving the stamp to some of the
present minor features of the country, is in either case, a very remarkable fact.

$ 6. GENERAL CONCLUSIONS.

From the foregoing considerations I cannot do otherwise, concerning the material facts,
than come to the conclusions, agreeing essentially with M. Bovcuer DE PuRrTHEs and
Dr. R1i60LLOTF, that—

1st. The flint-implements are the result of design and the work of man.

2ndly. That they are found in beds of gravel, sand, and clay which have never been
artificially disturbed.

3rdly. That they occur associated with the remains of land, freshwater, and marine
Testacea, of species now living and most of them yet common in the same neighbour-
hood, and also with the remains of various Mammalia,—a few of species now living, but
more of extinct forms,
