Therefore, the other zeros of ¢ (called the critical or non-trivial zeros) must lie in the (open) critical
strip 0 < Re(s) < 1 (e.g. [33,3740] for these and other key properties of ¢).

(d) Complex dimensions of fractal strings, via explicit formulae

Let L= (Gy be a given fractal string and ¢¢ = ¢c(s) denote its geometric zeta function, given in
§2a for Re(s) > D, where D = Dg is the Minkowski dimension of L. Briefly, the complex dimensions
of £ (or of 02, where 2 is any geometric representation of £) are the poles of the meromorphic
continuation of ¢¢. More precisely, let Uc C be a domain to which ¢¢ can be meromorphically
continued. Then, the visible complex dimensions of ¢¢ (in U) are the poles of ¢¢ in U. If U=C or
when no ambiguity may arise, we just call them the complex dimensions of L. We denote by D = De
the set of complex dimensions of L. In light of the definition of the abscissa of convergence of ¢¢
(§2a), ¢¢ is holomorphic for Re(s) > D. In fact, it can be shown (using well-known results about
Dirichlet series, see [22, §VI.2.3]) that ¢¢(s) > +oo as s > D*, s ER. Therefore, {Re(s) > D} is the
largest open right half-plane (of the form {Re(s) > a}, for some a € R U {+00}) to which ¢¢ can be
holomorphically continued. (Furthermore, {Re(s) > D} is the largest such half-plane in which the
series an G is convergent or, equivalently, absolutely convergent; e.g. [22, §VI.3].) It follows, in
particular, that we must always have D C {Re(s) < D}. If, in addition, ¢¢ can be meromorphically
extended to an open neighbourhood of D, then Dé D and D=max{Re(s):w € D}. Here and
thereafter, we (often) use the short-hand notation {Re(s) > a} :={s € C: Re(s) > a}. Similarly, if
a €R, {Re(s) =a@} stands for the vertical line {s € C: Re(s) =a}; and analogously for the vertical
strip {w < Re(s) < 6}, witha <p.
