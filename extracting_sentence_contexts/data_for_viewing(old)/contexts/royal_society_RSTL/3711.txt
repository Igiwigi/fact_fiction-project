mediate maximum at 0'0, and beyond these (or about the termination of the green)
the action again increases ; reaches another maximum at + 20'0, after which it de-
clines gradually, and beyond + 45 ceases to be traceable. Photographic pictures
may be taken readily on such papers, half an hour in good sun sutficing ; but the glairy
nature of the juices prevents their being evenly tinted, and spoils their beautyÂ®.

201. The ruddy tint which comes out when the green is destroyed by light, is in
all probability that which gives the whole colour to sere and withered leaves, whe-
ther simply disclosed by the destruction of the green which masked it in the live
state of the leaf, or matured by exposure to light during the whole season, either out
of the elements of the green colouring matter destroyed, or from the other juices of
the vegetable. It deserves to be noticed in connexion with this, that all the lively
vegetable greens have a large portion of red in their composition, and are in fact di-
chromatic. A good example of such a colour is a solution of sap-green, which, used
as a prism, is seen to transmit both red and green rays, separating them by a broad
interval which increases as the thickness or density of the solution is increased ; the
red ultimately preponderating, and the green being extinguished. If we view a
garden or shrubbery through a glass of a pure and deep red colour, every shrub, such
as the laurel, of a lively and brilliant foliage, and especially green grass, will appear
scarlet. Under such circumstances, a grass-plot, seen in contrast with a gravelled
walk, shows as light on darkness, contrary to their habitual order of illumination.
So great is the quantity of extreme red light reflected by a green sward, as actually
