Such an approach to the


construction of stable LB solvers for compressible flows was further extended in [26] by using
all of Gradâ€™s 13 moments (raw moments instead of temperature-scaled central) in the numerical
reconstruction of the discrete equilibrium state. Another approach to guarantee stability of LB
solvers based on polynomial equilibria for extreme configurations is to minimize deviations
from the reference state by adapting it to the local state of the flow. This rational is based on
the fact that the reference state is the only state in which such discrete equilibria exactly satisfy
entropy minimization, and hence all deviations in higher-order moments go to zero. In practice a
LBM-compatible formulation of this concept was first introduced through shifted stencils in [27]. Later on, a linear stability study along with theoretical analysis of the phase-space discretization
procedure confirmed the Galilean invariance of the discrete equilibrium distribution functions
(EDFs) and that, when using shifted stencils (with the shifts closely matching the fluid velocity),
one could achieve unrestricted Mach numbers [28].
