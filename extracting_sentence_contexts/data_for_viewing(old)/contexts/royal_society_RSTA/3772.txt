distribution: the magnetic field is almost constant within the ENZ host, due to wavelength
enlargement, while an enhanced flux of magnetic field is excited within the dielectric rod. For the
sake of completeness, the numerical predictions of the magnetic field magnitude enhancement
factors for a lossy ENZ host characterized by relative permittivity ¢, =i0.01 and ¢, =i0.03 are
reported in figure 5. Although the peak values of &4 are reduced as the imaginary part of
the permittivity increases, it can be concluded from the figure that the effect of resonant and
geometry-invariant magnetic field enhancement is preserved even in the presence of moderate
losses. Moreover, we remark that the geometry of these ‘arbitrarily shaped’ bodies was not
optimized to obtain a large magnetic field enhancement factor. Quite on the contrary, the shapes
were selected to illustrate the high degree of arbitrariness allowed for the geometry of the
ENZ host while still preserving the occurrence of the resonant effect. This includes shapes with
relatively rough boundaries, which are likely to minimize the field excited within the body.
Despite this fact, it is worth noting that the predicted magnetic field peak enhancements are in
all studied cases larger than the global maxima for the bare dielectric rod. This result supports
the concept of magnetic field enhancement being an intrinsic property of dielectric resonators
immersed in ENZ media.
