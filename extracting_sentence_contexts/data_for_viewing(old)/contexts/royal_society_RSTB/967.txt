[he action of members of this group, with one exception, is distinguished by its
sngth. Passive contraction of the muscle, followed by a well-marked rigor, occurs
a very dilute atmosphere of the nitrite is admitted to the muscle. Even so
an addition as the 3} cub. centim. of some of these bodies may cause a distinct

nis fact will of course suggest an early modification in active contraction resulting
stimulation. Active contraction is in fact rapidly abolished when the dose of
Etrite is sufficient to develop rigor, and more slowly when the dose is too small to
feduce this condition.

Ein order of activity as regards strength of action on muscle, they take the following
