This is a complete answer to question 5.

During the experiments many things were noticed which cannot be mentioned here,
but two ciremnstances should be mentioned as emphasizing the negative answer to
question 6. In the first place, the critical velocity was much higher than had been
expected in pipes of 8uch magnitude, resistance varying as the square of the velocity
had been found at very much 8maller velocities than those at which the eddies
appeared when the water in the tank was steady ; and in the second place, it was
observed that the critical velocity was very sensitive to disturbance in the water
before entering the tubes ; and it was only by the greatest care as to the uniformity
of the temperature of the tank and the stillness of the water that consistent results
were obtained. This showed that the steady motion was unstable for large
disturbances long before the critical velocity was reached, a fact which agreed with
the full-blown manner in which the eddies appeared.

12. Experiments with two streams in opposite directions in the ame tube, â€”A glass
tube, 5 feet long and 1'2 inch in diameter, having its ends slightly bent up, as shown in
fig. 6, was half filled with bisulphide of carbon, and then filled up with water and both

ends corked. The bisulphide was chogen as being a limpid liquid but little heavier

than water and completely insoluble, the surface between the two liquids being clearly
