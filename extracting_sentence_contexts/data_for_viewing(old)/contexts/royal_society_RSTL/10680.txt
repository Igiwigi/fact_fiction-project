numerous well-preserved foraminifera, chiefly of the genus Textularia, The spicules
in these cavities have undergone a remarkable alteration in structure ; they appear to
have lost their original silica, which has been replaced by glauconite and s8ome other
silicate of a greenish-white aspect. The replacing material has only partially filled
the form of the original spicules, and thus they look like mere shadowy casts of
complete spicules. These in many cases are peculiarly distorted and contracted
(Plate 45, figs. 154â€”e),

Spicules in varying quantities are also present in the beds of freestone and other
s1liceo-calcareous layers, in all about 27 feet in thickness, which form the lower part
of the section at the Ventnor Station quarry, These beds consist principally of fine
grains of quartz and glauconite with mica and calcite, and in appearance they resemble
the malm rock of the northern margin of the Weald, and, in fact, they have thus
been named by Mr. PArkix80Nn.* They differ, however, from the true malm in the
small proportion of silica which they contain, and T have not seen in them any silica
of the globular form 80 common in the malm. The sponge-spicules in these beds are
mostly represented by their hollow moulds, and these are 80 minute that only by
careful scrutiny can they be detected. They are, as a rule, more readily recognisable
in the small dark phosphatie nodules which frequently oceur in the beds. The
spicules are nob s8ufficiently abundant, however, for these beds to be considered as
definite sponge-beds.

In the lower series of the upper greensand strata, consisting of about 50 feet;
(10:5 m.) of yellowish-gray micaceous sands, usually soft and unconsolidated, but with
occasional harder bands, I did not detect any well-defined sponge-beds, but spicules
