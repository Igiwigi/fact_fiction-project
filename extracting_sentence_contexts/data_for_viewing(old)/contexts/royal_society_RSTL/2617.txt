The beautiful little Gasteropod named after the latter gentleman, who was its first
discoverer, was originally believed to be purely Australian, but upwards of a dozen
specimens were captured in the towing-net, about the latitude of Bahia, while
H.M.S.V. Â© Torch' was proceeding to Rio de Janeiro.

The disc of the foot when expanded was of considerable breadth, but its attach-

lateral borders were united posteriorly, forming a rounded extremity, to the upper
surface or heel of which the concentric horny operculum with spiral nucleus was
attached, but they were notched in front, so that the angles between them and the
anterior margin, which was slightly convex, were prominent and pointed a little
backwards. The raphe to be noticed in the mesial line, and in fact the whole
character of this part of the organ, seemed to shadow forth the transformation of the
Single foot of the Gasteropod into the wing-like expansions of the Pteropod. The
mouth of the animal was furnished with two horizontally placed, crescentic plates,
adapted for acting upon one another in breaking up food.

The lingual strap bore many points of analogy to that of the Heteropods, the
Single series of plates in the rachis being angular with a finely serrated border, and
the pleura consisting each of three rows of simple uncini, or with delicate teeth on

The eyes, which were distinctly to be seen with a common lens, were Surrounded by
