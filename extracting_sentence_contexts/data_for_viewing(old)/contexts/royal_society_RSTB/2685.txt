Tue investigations which form the subject of the present paper form the natural
sequel to my paper on the development of Asterina gibbosa (see (15) in List of Works
referred to, p. 133), which appeared in 1896. In the last-named work a complete
account was given of the way in which the body of an asterid with all its organs is
fashioned out of the body of the larva, and some important conclusions on the
subject of the phylogeny of the Echinodermata were suggested by the results then
obtained.

Tt has long been my desire to supplement the work done on a typical asterid by a
similar study of the development of an echinid, not only because I desired to obtain
such confirmation of the facts observed in the case of Asterina gibbosa, as would

convince those of my colleagues who remained sceptical as to the interpretations

placed by me on the phases of asterid development, but also because, whilst the
external features of the development of the Echinoidea were well known, our
ignorance as to the main course of the development in so far as it affected the
internal organs was very great indeed. In the present paper a fairly exhaustive
account is given of the building up of the body of the adult sea-urchin out of that of
