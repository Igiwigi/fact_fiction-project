In some specimens, however, a slender rod
is visible bounding each of the tentacle spaces ¢, and ¢, on their radial aspect ; these
rods we believe to be the radial margins of a, and a, they continue the curve started
by the divergence of a, and a. In front of a; and continuing the line of the
adambulacrals and articulating or fused with ad, is ad,, which is simpler in form
than the other adambulacrals and appears to carry no spines; at its other extremity
it articulates with the jaws ad, Possibly its form is a survival of that which it
originally had when the ambulacral pieces first moved upwards and outwards to their
present position ; it resembles the adambulacral pieces of the simpler and earlier
Eophiura. That the rods bounding the oral angle on the abactinal surface are formed of fused
ambulacral ossicles is suggested by the following facts derived from a study of the
fossils and models ; The main part of the rod is composed of an abactinal crest which
runs the whole length of a; and a, and of the radial border of a; This crest is
