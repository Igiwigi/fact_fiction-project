TO MONTSERRAT, B.W.LI. 31

SUMMARY

1—An investigation has been made of the earthquakes which occurred in Mont-
serrat after the arrival of the members of the expedition in March 1936, and of the
rate of emission of gases from the Gages soufri¢re.*

2—The variation of the seismic activity with time has been studied and an attempt
has been made to determine the position of the foci of the various earthquakes. For
the latter purpose two methods have been developed: The first depends on measuring
the amplitude of the horizontal movements produced by the various shocks at a
number of points distributed throughout the island. The second method depends on
the fact that the earth movements following the first arrival of the shock at any station
die away more rapidly the closer the focus to the observing station. This decay in
the amplitude of the earth movements with time has been analysed algebraically,
and from the results the relative distances of the different foci from the station can be
estimated. The two methods give results which are in reasonable agreement with one
another.
