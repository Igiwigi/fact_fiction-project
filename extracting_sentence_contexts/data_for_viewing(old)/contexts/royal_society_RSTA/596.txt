have analogies with the results obtained by Chansai et al. [42] over Ag/Al203, where hydrogen
reacted with the nitrates at low temperatures.

The NO, conversion at 200°C is increased from 23 to 40% in the presence of soot (figure 3b),
which shows a significant positive impact of the soot, as mentioned above. Another feature
observed in the experiment conducted at 150°C is that the minima observed in the NO,
concentration during adsorption for the 150°C experiment are deeper for the case ‘without soot’.
The initial decrease in NO, concentration can be related to the fact that the ammonia coverage
is gradually increasing on the surface and since the NO2 SCR reaction depends on the ammonia
coverage [43], it will result in an increased NO; conversion. Furthermore, there are initially little
ammonium nitrates on the active sites, but they are built up gradually which causes a blocking of
the active sites, thereby further increasing the NO, concentration. Because soot might block some
Cu,Oy or other copper sites the activity is higher initially for the case ‘without soot’ since the
copper oxide species are active for NOz SCR [44]. However, when more and more ammonium
nitrates are built up, the positive effect of soot interactions with ammonium nitrates is seen.
As mentioned above, the positive effect of soot on the NO2 SCR reaction might be related to
soot interactions with the ammonium nitrates, which make more copper species available for
NO SCR.
