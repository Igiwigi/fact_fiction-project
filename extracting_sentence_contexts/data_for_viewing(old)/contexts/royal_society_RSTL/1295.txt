conclusion of such importance, and so unsupported by the ge-
neral order of chemical facts, that it ought not to be admitted,
except upon the most rigid and evident experimental proofs.

I have repeated the experiment of the abscrption of ammo-
nia by potassium in trays of platina or iron, and its distillation
in tubes of iron more than twenty times, and often in the pre-
sence of some of the most distinguished chemists in this coun-
try, from whose acuteness of observation, I hoped no source
of error could escape.

The results, though not perfectly uniform, have all been of
the same kind as those described in page 55- Six grains of
potassium, the quantity constantly used, always caused the
