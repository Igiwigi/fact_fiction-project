This latter case is a version of the Taylor—Schneebeli
material consisting of piled, small diameter, unit-length rods assumed to experience identical deformation in any transverse
cross section. (Online version in colour.)

that are in contact with each other. Typically, the particles have regular geometries (spheres
in three dimension or discs in two dimension), their diameter being much smaller than the
characteristic length of the continuum body that their collective behaviour aims to describe
(figure 1). A fictitious linear-spring/dashpot/slider is employed to account for the interaction
between any two particles in contact with each other. The stiffness of the elastic springs and
the other ‘material’ constants for the sliders and the dashpots are not directly accessible from
measurements, but are related to the bulk properties of the physical solid (Young’s modulus,
Poisson’s ratio, etc.) and need to be calibrated through simulations of typical rock/soil mechanics
tests such as, for example, bi-axial compression and indirect tension test [4-6]. Numerical
simulations by DEM-type methods are dynamic in nature, the motion of the particles being
governed by the usual linear and angular equilibrium equations of Newtonian mechanics, while
the time integration is carried out with an explicit algorithm using a sufficiently small time step.
