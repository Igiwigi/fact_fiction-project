stations in Europe, is not found to prevail in anything like the same degree between the
curves of the two continents when they are exhibited in comparison. Nevertheless indi-
cations are not wanting of participation in disturbances having a common cause. .... The
character of the term-day, in respect to the degree of disturbance by which the mag-
netometers are affected, may always be derived alike, whether we view the European or
the American curves; and instances are not infrequent of individual perturbations
common to both continents, having their culminating points at the same individual
instant. There are sometimes disturbances in the same direction in both continents and
sometimes in opposite directions. On the other hand, there are perturbations, and
occasionally of considerable magnitude, on the one continent, of which no trace is
visible in the observations on the other.‚Äù

These facts were in full accordance with the conclusions which had been- derived by
the eminent geometrician of Gottingen from the obseryations of the Association formed
under his auspices. They were further confirmed by a still more extensive and search-
ing comparison, the means for which were furnished by a practice adopted at the British
Colonial Magnetic Observatories shortly after their operations had commenced, of sum-
moning the whole observing staff of the Observatory whenever in the course of the
hourly observations of the magnetometers (maintained without intermission except on
Sundays) they were perceived to be under the influence of an unusual disturbance ; and
thus the movements of each of the magnetometers were recorded at as short intervals as
cireumstances would permit, until the disturbance appeared to have snbsided. These
records were received at the Headquarter Office at Woolwich from Toronto, St. Helena,
the Cape of Good Hope, and Van Diemen Island, as well as from the Expedition
employed under Sir Jags Ross in the Magnetic Survey of the Antarctic regions, when-
