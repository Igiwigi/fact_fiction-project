S The above is a deseription of a Kerguelen skin in the ordinary brown plumage,
S hut whether this is the adult stage it is difficult to s2y. Many writers have drawn
© attention to the yariation in plumage in the © Nelly,” and the general opinion is
2 that the white plumage represents an albinism, but in the © Wreek of the Fayorite”
© (p. 187), the young bird is described as © grey, darker on the back,” while the adult
Z bird is said to be white. This view is borne out by the fact that the white-plumaged
2 birds haye generally some remains of brown feathers about their bodies. Dr. Kidder
E describes the nestlings as follows :—*© The down of the young bird is entirely grey
3 * in colour; the head is partly naked, and the hill, tarsi, and feet are coloured
Z © nearly as in the adult, but s0mewhat paler. The firs: fully-formed feathers are
& © similar to the adult plumage.” At the same time Dr. Kidder seems not to have
Z noticed any white specimens, and that these are rare near the Cape is proved by the
E fact that Mr. Layard (7. c.) states that the species is common in Table Bay through-
E out the year, and that © a white variety is common up the west coast towards
& © Walwisch Bay.”

A {The breeding places of the Giant Petrel in Royal Sound, which had long heen
an enigma to us, were discovered on Long Island by a shooting party from the
« Volage ” on the 23rd of December. The nests (according to the statements of
the officers) were of a similar make to those of Albatrosses, and contained half-grown
nestlings. They were constructed above ground amongst Azorella, about 200 yards
from the sea, not yery far apart from each other. There were two groups of them
on the S.W. ide of the island, each consisting of about 30 nests, which were situated
