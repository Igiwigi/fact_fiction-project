Figs. 1 and 2 are $0 arranged on the Plate that the 8ummer
and winter solstices (marked by a dotted line) are in the same vertical. The ab-
normal character of the winter temperature of the North American Continent is
strikingly manifested in this Plate. From the temperatures computed from the six years of observation and represented
in the plate, we learn many facts regarding the temperature at Toronto, which are
interesting in themselyes, and may become particularly s0 in their comparison with
the phenomena in other parts of the globe. Amongst these may be noticed the
following :â€”The mean annual range, or the difference between the mean temperatures
of the coldest and hottest months (February and July), is 42*7. The warmest day of
the year is July 28, being thirty-seven days after the 8ummer solstice.
