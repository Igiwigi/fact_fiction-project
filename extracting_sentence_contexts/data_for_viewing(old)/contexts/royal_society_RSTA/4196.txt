probabilities altogether. The consequence of such ignoring, in addition to being ad hoc, is that
contextuality becomes trivial and uninteresting.

We make no claim, however, that contextuality, in the sense of our definition, cannot be found
in behavioural data: we merely say that we have not found it yet. We also acknowledge that
there may be viable alternatives to our definition 7.1 that also take into account inconsistent
connectedness in a different way.

Finally, we would like to refer the reader to the concluding part of [3] to emphasize that absence
of contextuality in behavioural and social systems does not mean that quantum formalisms are
not applicable to them. The so-called QQ equality, in our opinion the most impressive outcome
of quantum cognition research to date [29,30], provides a clear illustration of how absence of
contextuality can in fact be precisely a prediction derived from quantum theory.
