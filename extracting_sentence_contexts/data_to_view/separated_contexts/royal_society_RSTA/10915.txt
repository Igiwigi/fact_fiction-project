We give a drawing, under oblique illumina-
tion, of this alloy (fig. 7). The drawing accurately represents a portion of the surface,
but is rather misleading as to the amount of interpolygonal matter, for if one takes a
general survey of the surface one sees that there is very little of this. We give a photo-
graph (fig. 8) to make this fact clear. Hence the alloy is extremely near to being a pure
substance, nearer, for example, than the previous alloy. After the drawing was made,
the section was subjected to a prolonged etching with strong bromine water.
