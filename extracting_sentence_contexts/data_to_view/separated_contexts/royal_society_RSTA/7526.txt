It is for this reason
that we have preferred to express the interpolation equation in the form

(n—1) = Kp/(1+at)

in which the value of « may be regarded as already established with sufficient accuracy
for its purpose, rather than in the ideal form

(n—1) = Kp/T = Kp](T) +?)

in which the last digit in the value of 7) is still subject to some small degree of in-
determinacy in a four-figure approximation.

(d) Relationships derived from compressibility measurements. In order to proceed further
with the comparison of the various relationships between refractive index and density
of gases, it is necessary to calculate values of 4, from the equation

3, = (b—a/RT)|RT

derived from equation (6-8), and this can be done if the appropriate values of R, a
and é are substituted from Van der Waals’ equation. But it has been shown by Berthelot
(1907) that the values for 4, at low pressures obtained in this manner do not agree with
the experimental facts obtained from compressibility measurements on gases at low
pressures. Following Berthelot, if Van der Waals’ equation is transferred to the form
employing the “reduced” variables 7, » and 0, where m = p [p,, v= v/v, and @ = T/T,,
p., v. and T, being the critical constants of the gas, then the equation becomes a
characteristic equation for all gases, which may be written as

(7+ 3/v?) (v—1/3) = 80/3,
and from which the departure from Boyle’s law is given by

d(m) _1(,_271
dn 3( Ss). The values calculated from this expression were compared by Berthelot with the

experimental determinations of the departure from Boyle’s law for many gases at
