testing symbolic rules, is much less clear than in language
(where there also are problemsâ€”see [122] for an insightful
discussion). Most discussions of grammatical structure in
music and animal song are based on so-called positive data
(i.e. examples conforming with the proposed rules) and it is
significantly more difficult to establish the validity and exten-
sion of rules in the absence of negative data (i.e. where
humans or animals explicitly reject a malformed sequence).
It is not clear whether ungrammatical/irregular structures
in music are clear-cut or distinguished in agreement by
non-expert or expert subjects. This difference between the lin-
guistic and the musical case may also in part be explained by
the fact that (at least in Western music), there is large diver-
gence between active and passive musical interaction.
Furthermore, negative data are, particularly in the case of
animal research, more difficult to obtain and also less clear-
cut or potentially graded rather than binary.

This issue motivates a number of changes in the nature of
models. Models may be grounded in foundations other than
grammaticality, such as optimal prediction or compression
(e.g. predictive power [56], minimum description length
[123], Bayesian model comparison), strong generativity or by
motivation to express form of a higher-order structure (such
as semantics or musical tension; see the following section).
