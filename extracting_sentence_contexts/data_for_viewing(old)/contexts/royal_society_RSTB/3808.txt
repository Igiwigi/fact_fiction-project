28 MR. R. B, THOMSON ON THE COMPARATIVE

writer regards as one of the fundamental features of relationship between these two
groups. The rays of the pines have undergone much specialisation, however, as has
the ligneous resin tissue itself—the formation of resin canals. This is a difference,
however, which merely indicates the higher state of development of the resin. tissues
and has no doubt been derived from the aggregation of the resin cells and the
degeneration of certain of the central ones, a feature which PENHALLOW (1907) has
already emphasised. ‘That this has been the course of events in the pines is indicated
by the fact that the canals form at the cambium as solid masses of parenchyma and
that the traumatic canals of the pines are usually solid (figs. 61, 62, and 65, Plate 7)
Very often, too, this is their character in the cone axis (fig. 64, Plate 7). Again there
are many references to the so-called tylosed condition in the fossil forms, but until it
has been proven that these canals were ever open they must be considered as
originating and remaining solid. Even in the living forms the true tylosed condition
is very much less usual than ordinarily thought, as some work which Mr. C. H. Morse
is carrying out shows. It is not to be inferred that the writer considers there are no
open resin canals in the Conifers, but only that the solid form is ancestral and that
this is indicated ontogenetically, traumatically and from the ancestral forms them-
selves.
