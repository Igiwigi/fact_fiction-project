If two events are incompatible, then their projectors do not commute;
otherwise, they are compatible. Therefore, in short, quantum theory uses the non-commutativity
of projectors to account for sequential effects. Complementarity refers to the fact that some
questions are incompatible. Measurement sequence effects are typically regarded as ‘nuisance effects’ or ‘methodological
artefacts’ by social and behavioural scientists [1]. However, from the quantum theoretical
perspective, they are evidence for the essential constructive nature of human cognition [2].
