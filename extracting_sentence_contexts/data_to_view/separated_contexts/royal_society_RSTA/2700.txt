Hg. Those for the first four were clear and definite,
and little doubt could be felt as to the correctness of their identification as a whole. The same certainty cannot be felt as to those for Mg and Ca, and, in fact, I give
below certain considerations which tend to throw doubt on some of them. The first
definite observations of the HgP are due to Mriner,t who gave the lines of orders
5 to 16. For 5 to 8 he gave values for P, and P, but, as later work of PascHEn has
shown, he allocated the P, lines to the real P, and his P, lines do not come into the
direct line of the series, although it is possible they may be collaterals.
