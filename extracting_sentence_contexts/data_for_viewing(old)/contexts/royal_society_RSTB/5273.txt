In Oe. (biennis x rubricalyx) x ammophila there are, on the contrary, seven chromo-
some ring pairs. These are frequently interlinked with each other during diakinesis.
Such interlocked ring pairs have to open out in order to separate from each other, and
they then remain open. As a result, variously-shaped pairs of chromosomes appear on
the heterotypic spindle. Lagging of chromosomes and other irregularities are much
more frequent in this hybrid than in the reciprocal. This difference in the pairing of
chromosomes in reciprocal hybrids, one may suppose to be due to the influence of the
cytoplasm contributed by the egg-cell, but it only shows itself clearly at the time of
meiosis. No evidence has been obtained of a corresponding amount of pairing in
somatic divisions, where the evidence indicates that the closeness of pairing varies within
a plant and does not correspond to the paired arrangement found in diakinesis.

_ The fact that the triple hybrid Oe. (biennis x rubricalyx) x ammophila has all its
chromosomes paired, makes it clear that complete pairing cannot be regarded as a sign
of the homozygous condition, as has been assumed by some previous writers. On the
other hand, it is not certain that the hybrid with seven free pairs of chromosomes
shows a greater amount of genetic segregation than the reciprocal with only three pairs
and the remainder combined into a ring. It may be held as a tentative hypothesis that
the linkage of chromosomes in Oenothera has arisen between non-homologous
chromosomes as a result of crossing. The formation of permanent heterozygous species,
the components of which are non-viable in the homozygous condition, as in various
Oenothera species, can be accounted for through the mating of certain non-homologous
chromosomes to form a pair in the F, of a cross.

The very characteristic and relatively fixed arrangement of the meiotic chromosomes,
