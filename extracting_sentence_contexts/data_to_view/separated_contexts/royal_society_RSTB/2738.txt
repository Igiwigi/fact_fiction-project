The experimental evidence which we have obtained points to the origin of fat by
photosynthesis, but we wish before giving this evidence to state that on the
principle that there should always be a direct proportion between weight of evidence
and gravity of subject we do not consider our evidence sufficient. If we thought
that it might be made stronger by repetition of the experiments, we should have
delayed publication till such repetition could have been made. But as a matter of
fact, we have repeated the experiments so often that we are convinced that our
present methods can lead to no more certain result, and this because of the
inevitable sources of error in our method of experiment. As postulated above, if
fat-depleted animals brought into the light show a re-formation of fat in the
chromatophores, we shall have made a large step toward the discovery of a photo-
synthetic process in the animal kingdom. But for the final step it will be necessary
to prove that this fat is not derived from the liver, blood, or some other tissue.
