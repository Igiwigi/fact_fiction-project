of leaf per hour is a measure of the maximum elaborative power of
the assimilatory centres. Such, however, cannot be the true explanation, since with
good illumination the power of assimilation, within certain limits, is always found to
increase with every slight increase in the amount of carbon dioxide in the outer air. We shall in fact show in a subsequent paper that there is within these limits a
remarkable quantitative correspondence between increased pressure of CO, and
increased assimilation. The restriction in the absorption of the gas by the leaf must rather be sought in
the difficulty which the gaseous carbon dioxide experiences in passing from the

assimilation, providing the absorption were perfect.
