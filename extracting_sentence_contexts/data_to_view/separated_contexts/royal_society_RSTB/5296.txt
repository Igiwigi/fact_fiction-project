The confusion and ambiguity
arising from this dual terminology are only too apparent. To make use of the term
Oxfordian at all is to court unintelligibility. Tn view of these facts we seem thoroughly justified in retaining the word Corallian
for the rocks which have for so long been known by that name. Apart from the fact
that it has become so familiar that the geologist who makes use of it is at least sure of
being immediately understood, it is even admitted by the leading Continental strati-
graphers that some such name is indispensable whereby to designate the shallow-water
episode between the Oxford and Kimeridge Clays. Thus Have, whose universal review
of the Jurassic system may claim to be the widest extant, although rejecting Corallian
because it does not conform strictly to the laws of nomenclature, adopts the alternative
name Lusitanien*
