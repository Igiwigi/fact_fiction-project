The first and immediate effect of the separation of a satellite is no doubt highly
speculative, but, the second effect seems to follow undoubtedly, whatever be the mode
of separation of the satellite. EVOLUTION OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM. 529

From these considerations we may conclude that the effect of the separation of a
satellite is to destroy planetary rotation, but to preserve angular momentum within
the planetary subsystem. Hence we ought to find that those planets which have large satellites have a slow
rotation, but have a relatively large amount of angular momentum within their

| systems,

| A proper method of comparison between the several planets is difficult of attain-
ment, but these ideas seem to agree with the fact that the earth, which is large
compared with Mars, rotates in the same time, but that the whole angular momentum

_ of earth and moon is large.*

© * A method of comparing the various members of the solar system has occurred to me, but it is not
founded on rigorous argument.

bog Tt seems probable that the small density of the larger planets is due to their not being 80 far advanced
= in their evolution as the smaller ones, and it is likely tha they are continuing to contract and will 80me
© day be as dense as the earth.

= The proposed method of comparison is to estimate how fast each of the planets must rotate if, with
&d their actual rotational momenta, they were as condensed as the earth, and had the same law of internal
= density.

= The period of this rotation may be called the © effective period.”

=] With the data used above, taking the earth's mean density as unity, the mean density of Mars is '675,
that of Jupiter *235, that of Saturn *125 or *111 or 074, according to the data used.

[= To condense these planets we must reduce their radii in the proportion of the cube-roots of these
S numbers.

5] Their actual moments of inertia must be reduced by multiplying by the 4rd power of these numbers,
S and as we suppose the law of internal density to be the same as in the earth, the moments of inertia of
Jupiter and Saturn must be also increased in the proportion 33438 to '26138.

= Then the * effective period ” will be the actual period reduced by the same factors as have been given
= for reducing the moments of inertia.

= In this way I find that the Martian day is to be divided by 1:3; the Joyian day by 2; and the Saturnian
= day by 314 to 444 according to the data adopted. The earth's day of course remains unchanged.

This 8eems to me to illustrate the arguments used aboye. For there should in general be a diminution
of effective period as we recede from the sun.
