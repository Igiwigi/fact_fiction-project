of achievement, namely, the sextant observations, which show how he is getting on. In like
manner the chemical distiller often proceeds, not knowing quite what will happen, but
guided by the temperature of the vapour, which is one of his many tests of achievement.
Similarly the lens polisher knows that his machine tends usually to make surfaces nearly
spherical, but he is guided by interference fringes, which show him how nearly sphericity
has been attained. Instead of an initial proof that one will arrive (proof of convergence)
there is in these, and in many other practical affairs, a final proof that one has arrived (test
of achievement). Why should not similarly skilful operations be considered respectable in
arithmetic ?

H. Iterative computations are not quite limiting operations in the strictest sense; for,
although the computer can always attain greater accuracy by doing more arithmetic, yet
in fact he is usually content with less than twenty significant digits; so that theorems about
infinite accuracy are not required. Here is another resemblance to lens-polishing; for if a
lens is correct to within a tenth of the wave-length of light, that is near enough.

8. A GAUTION RELATING TO ALMOST PROPORTIONALITY

The division test gives n estimates of a latent root. In many examples the true value has
been found to lie between the greatest and the least of the estimates. The comfortable feeling
of security induced by such experiences received a rude shock in the example of §5, where

KX5+ Xo = (5-71, 5°82, 5°75, 5-84},
but the true value of the latent root was outside the range of these estimates at A, = 5-236.
The computer abandoned the division test because the column X° was out of proportion
