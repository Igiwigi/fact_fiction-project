And the authors say : © The colour, when polished, had a yellow tinge. A piece of
the alloy has been exposed to moist air for a considerable time together with a piece of
pure iron ; they are both a little rusty, not, however, to the game extent, that with
the nickel being but slightly acted upon comparatively to the action on the pure iron ;
it thus appears that nickel, when combined with iron, has some effect in preventing
oxidation, though certainly not to the extent that has at times been attributed to it. It is a curious fact that the game quantity of the nickel alloyed with steel instead of
preventing its rusting appeared to accelerate it very rapidly.” |

IV. Troilite of the Cranbourne siderite. The Brvor meteorite contains many nodules of troilite lying here and there amongst
the plates and erystals of nickel-iron, always in rounded masses, only very occasionally
an ill-detined cleavage plane being met with.
