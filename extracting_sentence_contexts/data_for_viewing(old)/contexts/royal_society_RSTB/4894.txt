frequency of primordial genera (ef. Table X).

the derived distribution is cut off, the modal age lies just to the left of the limit and
the square has nearly twice the area of the small portion of the curve that is left. The
odds are nearly 2 to 1 that a genus of 100 species or more is one of the primordial genera

(or genera reckoned as such, ¢f. the discussion at the end of Section IV). As a matter
of fact the number of genera with 100 species or more in the Chrysomelide is only 16
(Table V) and we have to class some 65 genera as primordial (Table TV).
