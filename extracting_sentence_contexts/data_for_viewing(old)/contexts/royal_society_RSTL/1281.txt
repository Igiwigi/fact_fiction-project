Trex: are few enquiries in natural science more calculated
to awaken our curiosity, than those relating to the changes
which the matter composing the surface of our globe has
undergone. The imagination is excited by the magnitude of
the operations, by the obscurity of the phenomena, and the
remoteness of the time at which they occurred ; and all the
intellectual powers are required to be brought into activity
to find facts or analogies, or to institute experiments, by which
they may be referred to known causes.

The crystallizations constituting the whole of the rocks
which are usually called primary, and those found in such
abundance, even in the rocks which are termed secondary,
prove that a considerable part of the materials of the surface
of the globe must have been either fluid or aeriform ; for
these are the only states from which the regular arrangements
of the molecules of bodies constituting crystals, can be pro-
duced.

Geologists are generally agreed, that the greater number
