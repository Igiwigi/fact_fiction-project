Regarding the results obtained via MEEMD we point out that, even if the results are
comparable with that produced with the proposed method, this approach has disadvantages.

First of all it is still an open problem to prove the convergence of this technique even in one
dimension. In fact, in this case, the method reduces to the so-called EEMD technique, whose
convergence is not known. Whereas we recall that, even if the convergence of the MIF method
is still an open problem as well, its one-dimensional version, the iterative filtering technique, has
been proved to be convergent under mild conditions [4]. Furthermore, the MEEMD has been
found to be much slower than the proposed method.
