E. SHAW ON THE NEWTONIAN CONSTANT OF

k being any number and f any function expansible by Taynor’s theorem which
vanishes with m/M. For on expanding by Maciaurtin’s theorem we have

acceleration = M**f" (0) >

This is independent of m and therefore satisfies the experimental facts. There is
an application of Vicarre’s principle to the present subject; for k might vary
according to the temperature of the large attracting body. It need only be constant
as long as all the physical conditions (other than mass) are constant.
