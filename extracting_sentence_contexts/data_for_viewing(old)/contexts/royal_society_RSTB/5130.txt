Some vessels, which he calls ““ lymph arteries,” carrying the lymph from the centre to
the periphery, and a complementary set, “ lymph veins,” returning it from the periphery
to the centre. A similar afferent and efferent lymph circulation is said by Jourparn
to have been noted by Foumann in the gills.

These observations of JouRDATN have more recently been confirmed in several species
of flat fish by Maver (114), so that there seems to be no doubt of their accuracy.

In these researches on young living fish the terminal branches of the lymphatics in
the fins only were suitable for study, owing to the relative opacity of the body; thus
no information could be given either of the anatomical relations of the larger components
of the two systems or of any possible difference in the structure of their individual
vessels. The fact, however, that in Teleosteans there is a complete two-way circulation
of lymph, and not, as in land Vertebrates, a flow only from the periphery to the centre,
is in itself of very great interest, and incidentally suggests strongly that the “fine ”
vessels described above in Lophius are the afferent component (lymph arteries) of the
lymphatic system and the ordinary lymphatics the efferent component (lymph veins).

Neither JourpAtIn nor Mayer give any indication of the source from which the
afferent vessels derive their contents, nor any very satisfactory explanation of the means
by which the lymph circulation is driven, though it is suggested by JourDAIN that the
flow is probably effected by the muscular respiratory movements, and by Mayer that
the source of propulsion is the heart. JouRDAIN gives no idea what the object of this
type of lymph circulation may be, but Mayer is led to suppose that it is to convey
nutrient material (in the form of granules in the leucocytes) from the viscera to the
