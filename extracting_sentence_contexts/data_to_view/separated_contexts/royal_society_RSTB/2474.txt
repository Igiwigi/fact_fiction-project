T have noticed in certain night animals, more particularly in the Galagos and
Lorides, a heaping-up of pigment all around the periphery, which, seen with the
ophthalmoscope, greatly resembles Retinitis pigmentosa. Exposing a Galago to day-
light for some montlis, I found it to go quite blind; the invasion of the pigment
could clearly be seen to advance concentrically towards the posterior pole, as I have
seen the disease spread in Man. It is a well-known fact that Bears frequently become
blind in captivity, owing to their being too much exposed to light. Although in cases of Retinitis pigmentosa both day-blindness and night-blindness
oceur, I thought that these observations on night animals pointed to the possibility
of arresting the insidious progress of the disease, of which blindness is the invariable
termination, by shielding the eyes trom the most active rays of daylight. A few
attempts to do this by the use of spectrum-blue goggles—glasses which only
transmit the centre of the spectrum, viz., the blue, green, and a portion of the yellow
rays—have given encouraging results, and I am therefore persevering in that
direction.
