(c) Continental crust formation: is it a plate tectonic signal? 3

Some geoscientists assume that, because continental crust is generated by plate tectonics today |
(mostly above subduction zones at convergent plate boundaries), the existence of continental : Ss
crust of any age implies that plate tectonic processes must have operated in order to form .
such crust. This is a logical fallacy, because if this assumption was correct then the existence of
continental crust as old as 3.8Ga must indicate that plate tectonics began at least that long ago.
In fact, most geoscientists agree that plate tectonics began significantly after 3.8 Ga [26], so the
implicit linkage between formation of continental crust and plate tectonics should be critically
considered.

There is no empirical or experimental evidence indicating that plate tectonics is required in
order to generate continental crust. Formation of thickened crust of more felsic composition than
expected for mantle melts (basalt) only requires hydrous magmatic conditions, including hydrous
mantle melting and/or remelting of hydrous mafic crust. The importance of water for generating
felsic melts has been known for decades. Campbell & Taylor [49] were among the first to argue
that involvement of water in magmagenesis is required to make felsic continental crust. Hydrous
melting of mantle tends to generate more Si-rich magmas (e.g. [50]), including high-Mg andesite
and boninite, and such compositions can fractionate to form proportionately much larger volumes
of felsic magma than can dry basaltic magmas. In addition, mafic rocks metamorphosed under
