Normal unfed flies

The preceding pages have been devoted to setting out a considerable body of fact. The reader now possesses some knowledge of the limits of temperature and humidity
within which life is possible ; of the duration of life, of fed and unfed flies, under
defined conditions of climate ; and of the effect of climate on reproduction and on
feeding. We propose to study the physiological causes which may be supposed to
underlie these effects.
