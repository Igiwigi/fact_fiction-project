Perhaps the simplest way of building up the functions u_, . . . is to act upon a
hint, derived from a study of Hetmuontrzâ€™s theory of acoustical resonators.t We
may, in fact, attempt to satisfy the conditions, by regarding the disturbance B as
consisting of a system of standing waves; and we find that the method thus
suggested is successful. We shall proceed on the assumption that the displacements,
represented by w_, . . . , constitute a system of standing waves.
