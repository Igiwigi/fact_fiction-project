place, therefore, without difficulty or loss through the substance of a thin membrane,
although the mechanical flow of a liquid may be nearly stopped by such an obstacle.

It is well to bear in mind the last fact in the consideration of what is seen in an
endosmotic experiment. An open glass tube, with one end expanded into a bell form
and covered by tight membrane, forms a vessel which may be filled with a saline solu-
tion and immersed in a jar of pure water. The volume of liquid in this osmometer
s20n begins to increase and is observed to rise in the tube, while the simultaneous
appearance of salt in the water of the jar may easily be verified. M. DuTrocuer de-
scribed the result as the movement of two unequal streams through the membrane
in opposite directions, the smaller stream being that of the saline solution flowing
outwards, and the larger that of pure water flowing inwards. The double current
has been always puzzling, but the expression of the fact becomes more conceivable
when we say (as we may do truly) that the molecules of the salt travel outwards by
diffusion through the porous membrane. It is not the whole saline liquid which
moves outwards, but merely the molecules of salt, their water of solution being
passive. The inward current of water, on the other hand, appears to be a true sensible
stream or a current carrying masses. 'The passage outwards of the alt is inevitable,
and being fully accounted for by diffusibility, requires no further explanation. It is
the water current which requires consideration, and for which a cause must be found.
This flow of water through the membrane I shall speak of as osmose, and the
unknown power producing it as the osmotic force. It is a force of great intensity,
capable of snpporting a column of water many feet in height, as shown in DuTRoCHET's
well-known experiments, and to which naturalists are generally disposed to ascribe a
wide sphere of action, both in the vegetable and animal kingdoms.
