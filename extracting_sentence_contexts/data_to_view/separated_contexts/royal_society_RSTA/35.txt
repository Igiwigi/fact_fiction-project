Equation (2.5) will still calculate the appropriate interactions
between partial dislocation lines and between the partial dislocations and the externally applied
stress. Conversely, for partial dislocations, equation (2.6) no longer applies. In fact, to accurately
model the stacking fault region bounded by leading and trailing partial dislocations, a better
approximation of the material y-surface must be included. To this end, we replace E°°"* above,
with the generalized stacking fault energy (GSFE), E8*°. Similar to E°°"*, E8*f also accounts for


the energy required to move the dislocation core through the crystal lattice [9-12].
