@rsted had tried to place the wire of his galvanic battery perpendicular (at right angles)
over the magnetical needle, but remarked no sensible motion. Once, after the end of his
lecture as he had used a strong galvanic battery to other experiments, he said: ‘let us
now once, as the battery is in activity, try to place the wire parallel with the needle’.
As this was made he was quite struck with perplexity by seeing the needle making
a great oscillation (almost at right angles with the magnetic meridian). Then he said:
‘let us now invert the direction of the current’, and the needle deviated in the contrary
direction.?

Orsted’s original interpretation was that the magnetic effects produced by the current through the
wire radiated outwards in the same way that heat or light does. But after further experimentation
he showed that in fact the produced magnetic field circled around the wire (although of course
no one was yet thinking in terms of fields).

Within months of @rsted’s discovery, the French physicist and mathematician André-Marie
Ampére had shown that two current carrying wires placed in parallel close to each other each
generated magnetic lines of force that caused the wires to be attracted or repelled from each other
depending on whether the currents were flowing in the same or in opposite directions. Ampére
would go on to help found the field of classical electromagnetism and has the SI unit of electric
current named after him.

Ampére and Orsted had shown that, somehow, electricity could be converted into magnetism,
but they and others had failed to do the reverse: to create electricity from magnetism.
