Review for January 1843. The subsequent discovery of the cellular
composition of the ultimate fibrilla of striated muscular fibre, by himself and Prof. Snazyzy contemporaneously,
and the accumulation of various facts relative to the existence of cells or cell-nuclei at the peripheral extremi-
ties of the afferent nerves, as well as in the central organs, seem to justify the assertion that unmetamorphosed
cells are the active agents in the production of Muscular and Nervous force; in the former case effecting con-
traction by their change of form, and in the latter deyeloping nerve-force, which is transmitted along the fibres
as its conductors.

{ The author is particularly desirous that he should be understood as implying by the term © cell-force,”
not that the force is produced or generated by the cell, but that the growth of the cell is the most general
objective manifestation of that force, and that the cell affords the ordinary instrumental condition for its exer-
tion, though there can be no doubt that the force may be exerted in many cases in which cell-deyelopment
does not take place, The use which he would make of the term is just that which is commonly made of the
term © Engine-power;” every one knowing that the steam-engine possesses no power itself, but that it is
simply the instrument most commonly employed, because the most convenient and adyantageous yet devised,
for the application of the expansive force of steam, generated by the application of heat, to the production of
mechanical motion. MDCCCL. 5B

This inference derives a remarkable confirmation from a series of facts, which indi-
cate that when that specialization of function takes place, which has been mentioned
as a characteristic, of the higher organisms, the cells which become the instraments
of s0me one particular kind of operation seem to lose their other endowments,—as if
the expenditure of the vital force of each cell upon any one purpose, unfitted it, for
any other agency. 'Fhus the assimilating cells (whether floating in the nutrient fluids,
or included in the absorbent glandula), whose function it is to convert the raw material
supplied by the food into organizable plasma, exercise little or no purely chemical trans-
formation ; they do not undergo change of form; they do not exert any mechanical
or neryous power; and they do not reproduce their kind.
