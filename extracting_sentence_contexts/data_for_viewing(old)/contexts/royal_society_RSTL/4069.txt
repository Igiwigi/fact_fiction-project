It thus appears that from three to five grains of sulphur pass off daily by the urine
= in some other combination than as snlphuric acid, and that these three to five grains
S amount to about one-fourth of the whole quantity of sulphur excreted by the kidneys.
L With a view to ascertain what compound contained this sulphur in the urine, IT
= Z have examined the precipitates produced in urine by neutral and basic acetate of
lead, after the separation of the sulphates by baryta, and find that they only contain
Z traces of su]phur. The colouring matter described by Scnzres, and obtained by the
Z method he adopts, likewise contains only a trace ; whereas the liquid containing
the urea, generally considered free from all other organic matter, which remains on
3 the separation of the precipitate by basic acetate of lead, contains nearly the whole
Z of this excess of sulphur, but how combined I have not yet been able to ascertain.
ES The determination of this question, which I propose to examine, may possibly lead
= to some interesting facts, and perhaps throw some light upon the question respecting
Z the formation of cystic oxide.
= From some preliminary experiments made for the purpose of ascertaining whether
E phosphorus was contained in urine in any other compound than as phosphate, the
E following results were obtained.
S To the four ounces of urine employed for the preliminary determination of the
= sulphurie acid and sulphur in the former experiment, after the precipitation of the
sulphuric acid by barytes, some more nitrate of barytes was added and then the

A whole carefully neutralized with ammonia. The following quantities were ob-
tained :â€”
