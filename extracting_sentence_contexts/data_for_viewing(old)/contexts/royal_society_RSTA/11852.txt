In this way I obtain a permutation of the letters in «**y, where the exponents
8, 2, 1 enumerate the nodes in the successive rows of the lattice. This permutation
possesses the property :—

“Tf a dividing line be made between any two adjacent letters of the permutation,
the succession of letters to the left of the dividing line is like the whole
permutation, such that « occurs at least as often as 8, 8 at least as often
as y; in other words, the numbers which specify the occurrences of «, B, y,
are in descending order of magnitude.”

In fact, if the process of forming the Greek letter succession (or permutation) be
arrested at any point, the lattice numbers that have been dealt with occupy a set of
nodes which also constitute a lattice, complete or incomplete.

It follows, of course, that the first letter of the permutation must be a. The lattice
arrangement of numbers is recoverable from the permutation, for it is merely
necessary to write the numbers in descending order underneath the letters when we
see that the successive lattice rows are indicated by the letters «, B, y, respectively,

The process is thus unique, and there will be as many different Greek letter
