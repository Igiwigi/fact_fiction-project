56 DR. C. E. BEEVOR AND PROFESSOR V. HORSLEY ON THE

Consideration of the foregoing Facts with especial Reference to Movements of the
Individual Halves of the Tongue after Separation along the Median Plane.

We have already described the movements of the tongue as a whole, and we have
alluded to the questions of unilaterality and bilaterality of movement of this organ.
â€˜A new and unexpected light was thrown on this subject by the following attempt to
differentiate the complex movements of the entire tongue, and to determine what
share is taken by each half in the production of any given action.

It occurred to us that much might be learnt by regarding the tongue, at least for
the longitudinal muscles, as constructed of two similar halves ; further, that these
might be separated from each other by a vertical incision in the middle line, and this.
without injury to the nerve supply of each half.
