in the last place. Thus, in the rays which do not meet the axis, an irremovable
accumulated error of 10 or more units could cause no surprise, and for this reason the
trigonometrical method loses any advantage over the formule given above which it
might claim from resting upon exact formule. The differences under discussion are,
however, minimal, since 550 units in the last decimal place only amount to 1 second
of are. id

But pursuing the question a little further I believe, in spite of the evident care
with which the whole of StemnHEIL’s calculations have been carried through, that the
comparison above shows that a small error has crept in in respect to ray (5).

If we take the general agreement as showing that the trigonometrical calculation
does in fact bring in no terms of the aberrations beyond the 3rd order, we can readily
analyse STEINHEIL’s numbers in more than one way so as to derive the coefficients
8,G, ... from them.

Take the formule (24); on the outer ring ¢ = 0, 45°, 90°, 135°, 180°, correspond
respectively to the rays 2, 3, 4, 5, 6; thus we have
