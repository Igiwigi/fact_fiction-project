Across the animal kingdom, larger the range of FO values overlaps between male and female speak-

bodies often produce vocalizations with lower frequencies ers and is subject to culturally and individually variable vocal
[15-18], and human listeners perceptually associate low pitch modulation, such as when speakers actively change pitch to
and low resonance frequencies with larger bodies [19,20]. This produce a range of gendered meanings (e.g. [34-36]). Despite
link between acoustics and body size is proposed to motivate this cultural and individual variation, listeners are highly sensi-
a diverse range of communicative uses of pitch, including the tive to the distinction between male and female voices, a skill
following three related classes of facts: (i) social indexing, that arises early but continues to develop throughout oneâ€™s life-
such as using vocal modulation to signal dominance and defer- time [37]. Evidence from auditory Stroop tasks with male and
ence; (ii) size sound symbolism, such as using pitch to iconically female voices shows that people automatically process the
depict size differences; and (iii) proposed universal tendencies speaker's gender even when this information is task irrelevant
in intonation phonology, in particular the use of rising pitch [38]. This automaticity of paying attention to vocal gender
contours to signal questions [21,22].
