ftroy them in that manner, muſt know, that he might
have thrown combuſtible matter, ſufficient to burn
the galleys, from his projetile machines: For we
cannot imagine that he was ignorant of every kind of
theſe, and not even of the wildfire of the Greeks. But, however, to account for his burning the fleet, by
a ſpeculum, was the difficult point. When philoſophers began to increaſe their catop-
trical experiments, which they did very early, they
found the focus, of every ſpeculum that was concave,
fo ſhort, that they were eaſily inclin'd to conclude,
that Archimedes could not ſet fire to the fleet by a
ſpeculum ; and hence the fa& became intirely dif-
credited, till the famous Kircher, and his pupil Schot-
tus, whoſe characters and works the learned world
are well enough acquainted with, reſolv'd to conſider
not only the ſtory of Archimedes, but alſo that of
Proclus, who is faid to have deſtroy'd a fleet at Con-
ſtantinople in the ſame manner,

Kircher, however, notwithſtanding the incredulity
that appear'd every-where among the learned of his
time, concerning thoſe facts, was not deterr'd from
giving great attention to the matter himſelf; which
led him to make innumerable experiments, in order
to ſee whether it was poſſible to be done or not, be-
fore he would give any opinion about it; and at
length, when he had commended the parabolical ſpe-
culum, which he, and others, were inclin'd to think
the molt likely to ſucceed in ſuch an enterprize; he
was inclin'd to think, Archimedes made uſe of ſuch
a ſpeculum, But, ſoon after, he was diſcontented with this
notion, and began to make new eflays ; and, being +

happy in his invention, he fell upon one, which Ief-
ſen'd his former good opinion of the parabolical ſpe-
culum, and made him ruore ſenfible of the incon-
veniencies attending it, or thoſe of any other form,
that had any great degree of concavity ; and, in a
word, engag'd him intirely in favour of his new
thought, which was put in execution in the following
manner:
SQ He erected a frame, on which he placed five plane
» {pecula, of equal given dimenſions, with ſuch incli-
S nations as made them all throw their reflected rays
'Z upon the ſame place, at more than one hundred feet
= diſtance, When he had ſet the firſt ſpeculum, he
= went and laid his hand upon the place, whereupon
© he caug' the rays to fall, and found it warm ; when
:Z he added thoſe of the ſecond, the heat was doubled ;
:S the third increas'd the heat in the ſame proportion ;
2 and the fourth being added, the heat was ſcarce to
S be borne ; but the fifth made it intolerable.
