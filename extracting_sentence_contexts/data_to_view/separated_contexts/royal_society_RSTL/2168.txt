On exami-
nation it proved to be common air, with a slight excess of azote, equivalent altogether
to only four and a half cubic inches in the gallon of water, or about one sixtieth part
of the volume. This quantity is not two thirds of the amount found in river water, nor more than
half 'that in the waters of ordinary springs. The deficiency may be ascribed to the
agency of saline matter in expelling air from water, in the process of solution, a fact
particularly exposed in my paper on Nitric Acid published in the Journal of Science
for January 1819. One thousand grains of the water evaporated to dryness on a steam bath, afforded
a group of saline crystals, which, after gentle ignition in a covered platinum capsule,
weighed sixty-two and a half grains, During the ignition of the mother-water salts,
a faint odour, resembling that of muriatic acid mixed with the hydrobromic, is per-
ceptible. As this water has its transparency hardly disturbed by nitrate of barytes, it ob-
viously contains no appreciable quantity of sulphuric salts.
