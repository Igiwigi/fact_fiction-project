'= For the present this can only be regarded as a hypothesis. It might be objected
that T have inverted the order of events—that, since the Schizomycete is able to
a evolve small quantities of carbon dioxide daily, from saccharine solutions, it may be
S that its powers are enhanced by the yeast-removing inhibiting substances of its
~ Sactivity. The objection is possibly valid, but I think the former hypothesis explains
5 most facts : how, for instance, is it to be explained that the Schizomycete slowly and
steadily converts the whole of the liquid sugar-solution into a solid gelatinous mass,
‘2if the organism excretes such inhibiting substances ?

3 All these questions must wait for answers, however, until we obtain some know-
Sledge of the products of the several fermentations, and compare those formed by the
‘2two organisms separately, with those developed by the symbiotic Ginger-beer plant
as a whole. = . CoNCLUSION.
