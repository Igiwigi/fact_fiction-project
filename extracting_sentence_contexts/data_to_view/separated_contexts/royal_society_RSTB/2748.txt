The case of Jsoctes is more interesting still; the sterilisation which appears
in both the mega-and micro-sporangia results in masses of permanent tissue in
place of merely nutritive cells. The details for the microsporangium have been
sufficiently discussed in the first of these Memoirs ;** considerable tracts of a tissue-
mass of a uniform origin, which may be designated a “ potential sporogenous tissue,”
develop as vegetative trabeculze and tapetum, while the remainder forms microspores;
from the history of development, and from comparison, the conclusion seems justified,
that the trabecule and tapetum represent sporogenous tissue which has been
converted into sterile tissue, serving other purposes in the very large sporangium.

|| Goren (“ Vergl. Entwickges.,” ScnENK’s ‘ Handbuch,’ vol. 3, p. 389) notes the fact that in the micro-
sporangia of S. helvetica and denticulala he has observed some of the spore-mother-cells to be abortive, and
suggests their function as nutritive cells.
