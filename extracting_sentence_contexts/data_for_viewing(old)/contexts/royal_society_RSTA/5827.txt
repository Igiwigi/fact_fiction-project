had without sync. This mechanism for entropy reduction does not involve any ‘thermal’ effects
like those found in inflationary models. However, there are no estimates as to how efficient this
process of entropy reduction can be, or how large synchronized regions might become before
hitting on the past singularity. This may also be related to the issue of whether or not sync has
any connection to the issue of isotropization in the past, cf. [61].

One last possibility related to the sync mechanism discussed here is about its connection to
the silent singularity and the role of spikes and their oscillations [23,57]. It seems that sync would
be perfectly suited for tackling the silent singularity conjecture. If we consider the past timelike
trajectory of a spatial point, it is a standard expectation (cf. e.g.[20], fig. 1) that the null cone of
the vertex point will become more and more narrow and inhomogeneities will be pushed outside
of them, hence residing outside regions of causal communications. However, we have seen in
the present paper that causally unconnected spatial points may in fact sync with each other, and
this could possibly contribute in making the evolution along neighbouring timelines decouple.
Nevertheless, such decoupled spatial points will evolve in unison due to sync even if they were
in causal communication only transiently or at all.
