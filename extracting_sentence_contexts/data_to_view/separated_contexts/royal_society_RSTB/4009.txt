The earliest sign of activity in the ventricle as a whole, as estimated from the values
of extrinsic deflections, comes between 0°0070 and 0:0192 second before the upstroke
of 2. When we were studying the auricle we found that the value of the earliest
extrinsic deflection practically coincided with the value of the earliest intrinsic deflec-
tion in this chamber as a whole. In the auricle this fact can be easily established
because the excitation wave spreads from a single centre, whose position is favourable
to observation. In the ventricle our earliest extrinsic deflections clearly indicate that some region
is activated as a rule 0°0100 or 0°0150 second before R appears (and 0°0050 second
or more before @ is written). We had hoped to find intrinsic deflections of like value,
but in this we have been disappointed.
