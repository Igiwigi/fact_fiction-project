not do where there are no males, which is the case of a hive in
the spring, the time when the queen is most employed in laying
eggs; which made him suppose the use of the males was to
feed the maggots with their semen. It is probable that the
copulation is-like that of most other insects. The copulation
of the humble bee I have seen : it is similar to the common fly.
The sting is extended at the time, and turned up on the back,
between the two animals: they are some time in this act. In
the hornet it is the same. The circumstances relative to the
impregnating the queen not being known, great room has
been given for conjecture, which, if authors had presented as
conjectures only, it would have shewn their candour ; but they
have given, what in them were probably conceits, as facts.

* Mr. DzBraw, knowing the drones died in the latter end of summer, or the
autumn, was obliged to suppose a small et of males, that lived through the winter,
