In the plant quoted most
of the vessels of the fibro-vascular bundles appear to be derived from the leaves. 'The
outer vyessels of these bundles are smaller in size as well as more spiral in structure
than the inner ones. 'These facts have an important bearing upon the interpretation of
our fossil forms. NAGEL has argued that the fibro-vascular bundles belong to the stem
and not to the leaves, because he finds such bundles in Psilotum, in which the leaves are
deprived of them ; but the Psï¬†#lotum is altogether s0 exceptional a form that it can
scarcely outweigh the evidence afforded by the Lycopodia and Selaginelle. Guided by these examples, I think we can ascertain the homologies of the fossil stems
80 far as their tissues are represented in the living types.
