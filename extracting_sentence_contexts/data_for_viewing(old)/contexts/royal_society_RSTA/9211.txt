different limits for the S and D series referred to in [Part III. p. 404] is got rid of.
The link 919°58 above comes in in the cycle from 30806 in which a number of doubtful
links must occur. This one is clearly real, and it suggests that the adjoining one on
the map for S (3), 963 is a false one. The lines 27140, 281083 would then come into
the S(4) system. The map for S (4) has been drawn thus :

AgP (1). P,(1) = 30471'78, P, (1) = 29551°26, VP, = 30@44°66, VP, = 31565°10.

The linkage stretching from P, (1) is by far the largest, over 280 lines appearing as
linked together. In many regions the linkage is so complicated that it seems impossible
to exhibit it in one map. Four maps are used to show the connections, a chain leaving
a map at one line and passing on to the same line on another map. Amongst such a
large number there must be many coincidences, and in fact the presence of some of
them is shown by cycles in which the links do not identically annul one another.
There are also a few cases of chains which appear to pass on to other independent
linkages. It will be necessary, therefore, at first to make an attempt to clear up
these ambiguities.

The following cycles occur :—

1. 87574-43720. In map (i.) there is a chain from 37574 (col. &) to 43720 (col. p)
with links :—

—b+et+te—u—v+e—b+et+e+v = —2b4+3e+ 2e—-u.
In map (ii.) the same lines (col. 7 to col. n) are connected by the chain
