Nore sy Proressor Arruur Scuusrer, F.R.S. In 1859 Riewann* deduced an equation for the propagation of abrupt variations in the density and
pressure of a gas, on the supposition that such an abrupt variation could be propagated without change
of type. Lord Rayieicnt criticising this investigation, draws attention to the fact that a steady wave

is only possible for a particular relation between the pressure and density of the gas, which is different
from the one actually holding.
