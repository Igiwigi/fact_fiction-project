and so on for the equations for each of the first ¢, columns of 7.

For the (¢,+1) column, however, the non-diagonal term of y,,,; = 0 and the
equations for this column do not contain the elements of the preceding column.

In fact, the « columns beginning with the (¢+1) form a group related to one
another in just the same manner as the first ¢, are. We obtain from them, as from
the latter, the conditions
