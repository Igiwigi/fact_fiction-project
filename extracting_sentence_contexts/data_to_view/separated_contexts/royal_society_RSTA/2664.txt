The shot is drawn with the interval time of At = 10 (remember that our unit time
roughly corresponds to 1s in real time). As can be seen from these figures, the way of rupture
propagation is neither symmetric nor circular but is highly asymmetric and irregular in shape. In fact, it sometimes happens that the rupture propagation almost stops at a certain stage, while
the rupture propagation resumes again from a certain point on the rim of the (almost) stopped
rupture front as if that point were the second epicentre. Such a sequence of several sub-events forming a large one event reminds us the successive 6 |
ruptures of several ‘asperities’, sometimes observed in real large earthquakes, where the rupture

of one asperity appears to trigger the rupture of the neighbouring one. The standard view “3
of the asperity might be that the fault is spatially inhomogeneous in its material parameters, 78
each asperity being more or less rigid as a single body, with a weak link to the neighbouring :<
asperities.
