sulphuret of sodium attached—

Fe, Cy,, 3NO, 5Na+3NaS+6HO;
but this would scarcely account for its extreme facility of decomposition ; it may
therefore be supposed that caustic soda is attached to the alt, as we have seen that

it can be, in studying the action of alkalies on the nitroprussides, and that the sulphur
has taken the place of the oxygen, thus :—

Fe, Cy;, 3NS, 5Na+3NaO+6HO.

Either of these formula: would suit the analysis ; in support of the latter may be
adduced the fact observed by GrEcory, that sulpburet of nitrogen in the presence
of caustic alkalies acquires a deep transitory amethyst colour, which, on disappear-
ing, evolved ammonia, a description exactly accordant with the present case.

Action of Sulphuretted Hydrogen on the Nitroprussides.

30. Sulphuretted hydrogen decomposes the soluble nitroprussides. The products
of transformation are most conveniently obtained in the following way :—Nitro-
prusside of sodium is dissolved in the smallest possible quantity of cold water, and
three or four times its volume of alcohol is added to the solution. Sulphuretted
hydrogen is now passed through this alcoholic solution. Sulphur, prussian blue,
and ferrocyanide of sodium, are very gradually precipitated ; the action, however, is
very slow, and must be long continued. The alcoholic solution is now of a reddish
