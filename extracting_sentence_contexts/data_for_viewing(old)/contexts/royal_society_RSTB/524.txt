451 kilog. per hectare (= 403 lbs. per acre) were removed in the 3 crops of green
maize, leaving a balance of the nitrogen of the manure of 749 kilog. per hectare
(= 668 lbs. per acre), yet the surface soil was estimated to lose, not only this amount,
but 116 kilog. per hectare (= 104 Ibs. per acre) more, or in all 865 kilog. per hectare
(= 772 lbs. per acre) in the 3 years. Again, with the same supply, 1200 kilog.
nitrogen per hectare (= 1071 lbs. per acre) by manure, in 3 years, and the removal of
561 kilog. per hectare (= 501 lbs. per acre) in beet and maize in 4 years, leaving a
balance from the manure of 639 kilog. (= 570 lbs.), the soil is estimated to have lost
2076 kilog. (= 1854 lbs.) more; or in all 2715 kilog. (= 2424 lbs.). It is true that
when excessive amounts of farm-yard manure are applied there will probably be some
loss by the evolution of free nitrogen, but here the estimated losses amounted to much
more than the total nitrogen of the manure after deducting that removed in the
crops. Indeed, M. Den√©ratn calls attention to the fact that, according to the
figures, one-fourth of the total nitrogen of the surface soil has been lost !_ We repeat
that such losses certainly do not occur in practical agriculture. But, if such loss could

take place with heavy manuring for 3 years, and the removal of 3 crops of beet and
one of maize, what would be the result with ordinary manuring and cropping ?

How are these results to be explained? The accuracy of the analytical results
recorded by M. Drniratn may be taken for granted. It seems to us, however, that
in the method of taking the samples of soil for analysis, an explanation may be found ;
