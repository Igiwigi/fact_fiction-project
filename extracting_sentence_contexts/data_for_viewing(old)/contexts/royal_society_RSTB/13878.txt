groups is possible even if the groups are only subtly distin-
guished (ie. classification using a genetically informed
taxonomy is possible). Even the most subtly differentiated
populations become detectably different with enough mar-
kers and individuals sampled, making classification
possible (see [89] and references within, also [24]). For
example, Patterson et al. [24] derive an approximate relation-
ship between the number of observed markers, the number of
sampled individuals, the level of differentiation in terms and


the resultant ability to detect population structure. (These
facts resonate for me, given my own experiences detecting
subtle gradations of genetic structure in Europe using PCA
[23,90].)

The challenge is that two key facts can be true at the same
time: an apportionment of variance that implies the differen-
tiation among artificially labelled groups is minuscule at any
typical genetic locus does not preclude using all the loci
together to identify groupings of individuals.
