consist of a basal portion or protopodite, an expodite, and an endopodite. All three
pairs have hairs projecting from their tips, and these lengthen considerably within a
few minutes after the embryo is freed from the egg. The first antenna are nearly as
long as the second, and both pairs, as well as the mandibles, are organs of locomotion,
to row the animal through the water. The motions of the larva are very erratic and
violent, and consist of a series of quick leaps produced by vigorous backward strokes
of the appendages.

The outline of the body will be understood by a reference to the figures. When
the second maxille are in the centre of the field of view, as in fig. 21, the outline is
pear-shaped, with the broad end of the pear at the posterior end of the body ; but
when the metastoma is in the centre this is reversed, and the broad end is in front.
This difference is due to the fact that the dorsal region is much wider than the labrum
and series of buds, which together form a ridge along the ventral surface.

In a dorsal view the simple eye (Oc) is seen as a black spot on the middle line, near
the anterior end of the body. It did not show any traces of a division into halves at
any stage of development which was observed.

The ocellus lies upon a large rounded granular body, which is imperfectly divided
into halves by a notch upon its posterior margin. This body consists of the fused
cerebral gangha.

The dorsal portion of the posterior region of the body is swollen and rounded, as
shown in figs. 21 and 23; and near its lateral margins there are a pair of 8mall, but
