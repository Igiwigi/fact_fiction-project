components, especially for the FCG analysis under design by analysis [1]. With respect to many
metallic materials, it is a well-known fact that FCG accelerates significantly in hydrogen gas. Thus, in order to accurately estimate the fatigue life of components destined for use in hydrogen
gas, it is necessary to identify how the hydrogen-induced acceleration is influenced by different
factors (e.g. hydrogen pressure, loading frequency, loading ratio, etc.) and to elucidate the
acceleration mechanism. For some researchers, the key to understanding the hydrogen-induced,
FCG acceleration lies in the hydrogen-dislocation interaction in the vicinity of a crack tip,
especially in relatively low- or moderate-strength steels with TS of less than 1000 MPa (e.g.
austenitic stainless steels and low-alloy steels).
