approximately. The angular drift at the point of graze, as viewed from the projector, is

i 3 Y to the right,

and is therefore equal to the sum of the drift after burnt as viewed from the projector, and
the component of the angular deviation at burnt in the horizontal plane.

6:8. WIND

In §5-6 formulae were obtained for the angular deviation, yaw and rate of turn due to
the wind. In the derivation of these expressions it was assumed that the projectile was
perfectly launched. In actual fact part of the initial tip-off conditions will be due to the
action of the wind, but the contribution of these parts to the motion during burning is very
small and will be neglected. Accordingly, if w,(s) is the complex cross-wind (see (5-6-1),
we have, by (5-6-7, 8, 9),
