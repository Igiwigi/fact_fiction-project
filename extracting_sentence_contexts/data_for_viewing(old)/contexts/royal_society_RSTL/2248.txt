Dr. Davsexy has mistaken his meaning, and that the similarity he wished to point out
existed not in the bubbling of the gas (that not being peculiar to a chalybeate Spring),
but in the change of colour of the bottom ; for he says where the air came up most
plentifully, there © the cinders (elsewhere quite black) had a rusty appearance,”

As to the inferior degree of interest which Dr. Dausgxy connects with my manner
of explaining the phenomenon, it is of little importance. Truth, of course, or an ap-
proximation to it, is the end of inquiry; and the explanation which I offered had the
preference, becanse it appeared most in accordance with the facts. I would not wish
to undervalue Dr. Davusexr's speculations ; but in attaching s0 much interest to his
opinion, that the atmosphere is the source of the gas disengaged, derived through
subterranean channels, I cannot help thinking he has had recourse to a difficult
hypothesis of little usefulness ; for what facts are there in favour of the idea that
volcanic fires are fed like ordinary fires, or in any way dependent on the atmosphere
for their activity ?

That azote is often a product, and an abundant one, of extinet yolcanos is certain ;
but it does not follow that it is also a product of active yolcanos. Probably the am-
moniacal salts which form in s8uch abundance in certain solfataras, of which that of
the isJand of Volcano is the most remarkable, is owing to a complicated play of
chemical affinities, in which atmospheric air, sulphur, alumine, and steam are the ele-
ments chiefly concerned.

Pr. Davsexy concludes his note by expressing the wish that the quantity of gas
evolved by thermal springs should be ascertained. This is a scientific desideraturm ;
