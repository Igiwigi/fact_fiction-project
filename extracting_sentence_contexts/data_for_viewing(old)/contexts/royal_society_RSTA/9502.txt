Local mean time is, however, more generally instructive, and accordingly the necessary
transference to local time has been made in Tables XTX. and XX., and all the
subsequent tables relating to Fourier coefficients. The transference does not affect
the amplitudes. The corrections it requires to the phase angles are *

+19’ in a, +38’ in a, +57’ in a, and +1° 16’ in a,

Kew local time being the equivalent of 19’ after Greenwich.

The relation with sunspots will be discussed more fully later, but the significance of
the tables will be better understood if regard is paid to the following facts. 1890 was
a year of sunspot minimum with a frequency of 7°1. The frequency rose rapidly to a
maximum of 84'9 in 1893, and fell more slowly to 9°5 in 1900. In 1898 there was a
slight arrest in the fall, the mean frequency being 26°7 as compared with 26'2 in
1897. The year 1893, though the year of sunspot maximum, was on the whole a
quiet year free from large disturbances, much quieter than 1892, 1894 or 1895.

In Table XTX. ¢,, ¢., ¢; and c, all rise to a maximum in 1893, and the general.
parallelism with the sunspot variation is readily seen, especially in ¢, and ¢ Table
XX. shows a similar state of matters, except that the value of ¢, in 1898 fell short of
that in several adjacent years,

The variation in the phase angle is by no means so decisive. In Table XTX. the
