The present paper is an attempt to analyse,
by the aid of accessible experimental data, the question of the dependence of energy
on the interatomic distance for atoms and ions with closed shells. Attempts have been made to find reasonable expressions for the forces acting
between the ions in crystal lattices, by the aid of values experimentally determined
for density, elastic constants and compressibility of crystals. However, these attempts
have not been very successful, this being due to the fact that the above-mentioned
properties are determined by the first and second derivatives of the potential function
