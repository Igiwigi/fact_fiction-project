Subtracting 274
from this temperature to reduce the scale to Centigrade, we have temperature of explo-
gion =2231* C,

If we asume 4=*65, the temperature of explosion deduced in the same way would be
1950” C.; but this temperature, as we shall shortly show, would be somewhat too low,

We have now three points to consider ;—

1. Is this temperature a probable one? and can any direct experimental facts be
adduced to corroborate this theoretical deduction 2

2. What is the mean specific heat of the 8olid or liquid products which the above
temperature implies? and bvy

3.
