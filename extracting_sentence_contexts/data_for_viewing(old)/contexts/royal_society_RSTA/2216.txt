M-ring, while it is referred to as a K-staggered M-ring when x = ((2zr)/M)(k mod 2). We note that : &
N= KM is the total number of point vortices of this configuration. aaa
For K=1, this configuration is nothing but a single latitudinal M-ring, which is always a 14
vortex crystal with the identical strength. The 2-aligned/staggered M-ring is a special case of : =
relative equilibria, called a pair of M-rings, which has also been considered in [18]. Accordingly, in : =
what follows, we focus on the case of K 2 3. Figure 1b,c is the illustrations of 3-aligned/staggered : PS

10-rings with y =0 in three-dimensional Euclidean space. As far as we have examined, for any
y €[0,27/K) with K=3 and any 3S M<10, 3-aligned/staggered M-rings are always vortex
crystals whose corresponding configuration matrix has a one-dimensional null space. We thus
normalize the right eigenvector to the zero eigenvalue in the same manner as (3.2) in §3a to
obtain the strengths, which is denoted by Ij,,(y) for the mth-point vortex on the kth M-ring.
As a matter of fact, we find that M-point vortices on the same line of latitude (M-ring) have the
same strength. In other words, I,m(y) is independent of m. Hence, we observe the representative
strength ily) = Im(y) for the kth vortex ring in what follows.

Figure 4 shows the plots of the representative strengths Cy for y €[0,1) with y) =
2n/K, k=1,2,3. When K =3, they are all positive, namely [,(y) > 0. In addition, owing to the
discrete rotational symmetry in the longitudinal direction, we observe P00) = F3(), 10) =
Fi(1), P30) = Fa(1) for the aligned configuration, and Fy (0) = P3(1), 7300) = Fi), 12(0) =
P2(11) for the staggered configuration. We also notice that the strength T)(y) of the second vortex
ring becomes the largest for all y. In other words, the outermost vortex ring located in the positive
curvature region has the maximum representative strength. When K = 4, the sign of the strengths
changes alternately, ie. [y(y), 13(y)>0 and y(y), Py(v) <0. Owing to the discrete rotational
symmetry, they satisfy P00) =P), 120) = —F(1), 730) = —Pa() and 140) = —P3(1) for
