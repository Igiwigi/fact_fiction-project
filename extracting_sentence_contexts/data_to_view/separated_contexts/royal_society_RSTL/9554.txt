But here we have no such difficulty. The indication cannot be mistaken ; and we are enabled to affirm just as certainly that
there is discharge from the side of the tube, and that 8nch discharge is of negative
electricity, as if we could test the electricity actually coming from it. And again, the'
fact that the same indication of negative discharge is obtainable from all parts of the
tube (except perhaps in the immediate vicinity of the negative terminal) is direct. evidence that the discharge passes throughout the tube in the form of positive. electricity, since the response is throughout in the form of negative discharge.
