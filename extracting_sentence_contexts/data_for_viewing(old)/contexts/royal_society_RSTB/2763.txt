The periods for the occurrence of ovulation in the Primates have been the subject
of a considerable amount of controversy, the question being discussed at some length
in three papers by Mr. Wanrer Harper (1894, 1897, 1898), who shows that men-
struation and ovulation are to a very large extent independent functions. Mr. Hraprg
points out further that whereas, in both monkeys and the human species, menstrua-
tion may occur periodically all the year round, in monkeys there is a limited time
for conception and ovulation, while in civilised woman this period is not limited to
any particular time of the year, although there is evidence that primitively man
agreed with the lower Primates in having a definite sexual season.* The fact is also
noted that conception (and, consequently, ovulation) can occur in the human female,
even although there may never have been a menstruation. The discussion of these
facts is inseparable from the question regarding the homology between menstruation
in the Primates and the procestrum in the lower Mammalia, a subject to which
reference has been made above.

The Atretic Follicle—The sheep referred to in Experiment 6 furnished the only
unequivocal case of a follicle failing to rupture during an observed cestrus,{ although

* Hare, in a later paper (1900), gives a very brief réswmé of the evidence (derived largely from the
writings of PLoss and WESTERMARCK bearing on this subject. Very recently Messrs. ANNANDALE and
Ropinson have kindly furnished me in advance with the following statement, which has not yet
appeared :—
