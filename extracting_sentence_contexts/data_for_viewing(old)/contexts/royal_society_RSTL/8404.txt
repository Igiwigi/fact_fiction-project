In the ww of very inelastic and easily deformed bodies, snch as lead, Mr. Hirx has
shown ('Theorie Mccanique de la Chaleur, 2nd edit. part i. p. 58 &c.) that the heat

evolved is almost precisely the equivalent of the work expended in deformation. No
experiments (except those now to be detailed) have been made, however, 80 far as the
writer knows, upon rigid bodies, such as rocks &c., to determine whether this is likewise
true of them, although & priori the fact could scarcely be doubted.

99. A few preliminary experiments were made to ascertain if this was the fact. A short
cylinder of thin iron (& a, fig. 8) was lined with hard wood (cc), an iron plunger (5) was
fitted to the interior, the diameter of which just admitted,
without touching at the arrises (e), a cube of 1 inch on the
side. The cylinder placed on a plate of iron ( F') had a cir-

_cularpicce of moderately thick paper gun-wadding dropped
Sinto it; upon this the cube to be crushed was placed; upon
the top of the cube another piece of gun-wadding, and then,
Sthe plunger (6) being inserted and made to bear firmly on
Sthe matters below it, a known weight (25 lbs.) was dropped
Sfrom a known and constant height upon the plunger s0 as
