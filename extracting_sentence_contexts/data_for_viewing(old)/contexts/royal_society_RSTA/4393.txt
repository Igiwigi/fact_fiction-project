in figure 1) decreases rapidly, as a power law in fact. The pruning process stops at a final value of [2
k, not with a handful of recognized global ‘Tier 1’ carriers, but with a dense nucleus of about 100 Ss

ASes, each pair of which connect to each other over 50-100 distinct routes. Over 70% of the pairs
of ASes in the nucleus have direct links. With regard to the betweenness catastrophe sketched
earlier, the nucleus of the Internet functions as a giant non-blocking crosspoint switch, reducing
the number of messages that must traverse any single link in the Internet by the square of the
number of participants, or as much as 10000 times.

The ASes in the nucleus have achieved this level of interconnection for several different
business purposes—they are CPs and CDNs as well as transit providers of the more traditional
sort but coming from many large countries as well as from the USA. The scatter plots in figure 1
show that the degrees, z, of the nucleus ASes range continuously over about a factor of 100, with
