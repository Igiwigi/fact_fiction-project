Even in Ornithorhynchus, where the mutual
independence of primitive knot and primitive streak is so startling, these structures
very rapidly come into such intimate relation that they soon appear as differentiated
portions of a single axial structure. The knot is then found to be placed
approximately in the middle of the, then greatly elongated, embryonic area. In
view of this fact it appears to us that the apparent unity and continuity of the
elements in question in other instances must be regarded with some reserve. Tt must be admitted that in certain cases, both in birds and in mammals, there
appears to be complete continuity, both materially and constitutionally, between
Hensenâ€™s knot, with its blastoporic aperture or depression on the one hand, and
the primitive streak with its primitive groove on the other. Nevertheless, we here

insist that the facts of Monotreme development not only permit, but must be held
to demand, an analysis of the knot-streak complex into distinct morphological
elements.
