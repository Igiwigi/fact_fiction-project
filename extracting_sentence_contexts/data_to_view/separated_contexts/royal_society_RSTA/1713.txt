Then there exist v = v1 + v2, w= WwW, + Ww? and p satisfying (2.3) for 2 = R', and where

for some constants c,M > 0. The above lemma shows that the resolvent of the Stokes operator on the half space can be
written as an additive perturbation of the resolvent of the Dirichlet Laplacian with an integral
operator satisfying the above upper bounds. Estimating this integral operator and taking into
account the fact that Ap generates a bounded analytic semigroup on L?(R'/) for 1 <p < 00, we
verify that there exists M > 0 such that
