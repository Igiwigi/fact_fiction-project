Note (2).—The single datum from which the curves are calculated is the observed Zn maximum in Gy type
stars. Note (3)—The observed points were all obtained by an entirely independent method, the line-contours
method of Unséxp, assuming a formula for the atomic scattering coefficient. The fact that the calcu-
lated curves pass through the neighbourhoods of the observed points checks the general correctness
of the aggregate of assumptions made and formule used. E. A.
