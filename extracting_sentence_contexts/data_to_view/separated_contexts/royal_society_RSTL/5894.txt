Colonel Lawprox had considered the table-
Bland to be too distant to have any effect ; but calculation proved the reverse. 16. In fact, as it appears to me, while the absolute necessity of attending to local
Fattraction is strongly illustrated by the investigations I have given in this and my pre-
vious Papers, the utter hopelessness of attaining to any certain results seems to be as
clearly demonstrated. Here are causes, not only visible in mountain-masses and table-
lands and deep neighbouring oceans which affect the yertical, and which can be calcu-
lated if sufficient labour be bestowed ; but also invisible and hidden, as important as the
others, of which we know absolutely nothing, except that they may exist and that we
have no power of proving or disproving their existence. Were it not for these disturb-
ing causes, the comparison of the parts even of the same arc ought to bring out its ellip-
ticity (if the meridian be elliptical) with considerable precision.
