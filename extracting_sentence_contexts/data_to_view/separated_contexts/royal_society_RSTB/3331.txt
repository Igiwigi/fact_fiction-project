17 per cent., and although the average deviation in the first case is under 2 per cent.,
in the second it is more than 10 per cent. (see Table XTX). Our experiments upon guinea-pigs therefore prove, as clearly as do the rabbits,
that our formula B = W'/f, indicating that the blood volume is a surface function,
represents the experimental facts in an extremely satisfactory manner. . At the same
time, it is obvious that it would be quite erroneous to attempt to express the
blood volume for a given species as percentage of the body weight, as has hitherto
been usual. VOL, CCI.â€”B. x
