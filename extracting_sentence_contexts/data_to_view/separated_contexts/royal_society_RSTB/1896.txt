As the division of the nucleus draws near, the cytoplasm undergoes a change
which in plants that have been preserved with any preparation containing osmic acid
is very marked owing to the fact that the acid is very slightly or not at all reduced
at this stage. Thus the oogonia in this condition are easily distinguished from the
rest, even under a magnifying power far too low to admit of structural details being
discerned at all. This fact is of interest, indicating as it does that special metabolic
processes are going on within the cytoplasm, and that they are associated with
karyokinetie activity. The nuclei are, as has been said, of a large size, and they contain one or more
nucleoli, together with a beautifully clear chromatic network, which is even at this
stage seen to be markedly polarised (figs. 2, 3). Commonly, at the same time, a
