§ 10. Reference to the Moon's True Transit.

The intervals have been referred to the transits of a fictitious satellite whose R. A.
is equal to 7, and we now require corrections so as to refer to the moon’s true transit.


PROFESSOR G. H. DARWIN ON TIDAL PREDICTION. 185

Let T, T’ be the times of true and fictitious transits, and let # be the moon’s R. A
Then if ¢ denotes the mean solar hour angle at time T,

t+h—-a=q7,
aud, dropping the suffix o to 7, at time He
t+h—l=qrz,

where q is an even integer at upper, and an odd one at: lower transit.

Tf « be the value of the moon’s R, A. at time T’, then its value at T is
tata (I —T’); also the t+h of the first equation is equal to the t+ h of the
& second corrected by y (T — T’).
