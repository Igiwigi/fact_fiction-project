form a chimeric single guide RNA (sgRNA) that acts as the
sequence recognizer [74,75]. Within the sgRNA, 20 nucleo-
tides can be re-engineered in order to achieve efficient
binding of any given stretch in eukaryotic genomes, allowing
versatile targeted modifications [76]. CRISPR/Cas is often
presented as a revolution in biomedical research and receives
a lot of attention due to its promise regarding therapeutic
potential [77-79].

Figure 4. Induction of DNA damage by TFO-CPT or scPvull after transfection.
A2780 cells were treated with 2 ..M of the hTFO-CPT conjugate (and hTFO for
control) or 1 jxg of scPvull. After 3 h, cells were collected and stained for phos-
phorylated H2AX (yH2AX) and analyzed by FACS. Transfections were performed
in duplicate for three independent experiments. Data are represented as means of
the means + s.e.m. Statistical comparison was performed between cells treated
with Saint Mix only and cells treated with TFO only, hTFO-CPT or scPvull. *, p<
0.05, **, p < 0.01. The chemical conjugation of the TFO to CPT has been
described in detail elsewhere (see Vekhoff et al. [43]. In short, 3â€™ thiophosphory-
lated TFOs were conjugated to 10-(6-bromohexyloxy)-CPT and purified by
reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC): hTFO-CPT:
fetention time 18.6 min; mTFO-CPT: retention time 18.4 min. The conjugates
were characterized by UV spectroscopy, denaturing polyacrylamide gel electro-
phoresis and mass spectroscopy (ES-MS). ES-MS: hTFO-CPT: found [M-H]
4621.74; calculated: 4621.1. mTFO-CPT: found [M-H] 6988.24; calculated:
6988.8. SM, the delivery agent Saint Mix; scPvull, single chain Pvull.
