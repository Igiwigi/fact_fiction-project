The tissue of the ventral body wall, peripherally situated in the
cultures, spread out considerably on the clot, so that the diameter of the explant greatly
increased. In one of the two explants where the plates remained stationary, two opposite
rib stumps had fused, thus binding the plates to each other. Fusion of the halves usually proceeded more slowly in the controls, where the
ventral edges faced each other, owing perhaps to the fact that there is extensive
degeneration in the mid-ventral region as described in Part I, so that the cells probably
migrated less actively than those of the dorsal margins of the plates. When too much
ectoderm was left on the median body wall, the halves sometimes failed to unite after
24 hr. or more and then became joined only by a very thin sheet of cells. In other
cultures union was delayed or impaired by unusual softness and liquefaction of the clot,
a condition which is always exaggerated by the presence of degenerate cells or of
ectoderm.
