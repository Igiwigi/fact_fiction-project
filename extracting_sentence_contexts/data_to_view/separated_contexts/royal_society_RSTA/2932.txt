In
contrast with that, for a slightly supercritical coupling, the phase never supersedes z, whereas y
travels through its entire range and energy flows from one particle, which has a majority of the
energy in the beginning, to the other particle, which attains a majority of it in the end of the period
(with corresponding active impact dynamics). One notes the initial part of the orbit, corresponding to y <1, which is flat, much unlike the
majority of the curve, which is nearly straight with a slope of 3 for about half of its range. This
illustrates the fact that the asymptotic form of the Hamiltonian, with the vanishing y-? coupling,
is incorrect for y < 1. One other important point to be made here concerns the limit of vanishing
impact velocity. Clearly, this is an opposite limit to what was examined previously in this section,
namely E â€” 1+ instead of E > 1.
