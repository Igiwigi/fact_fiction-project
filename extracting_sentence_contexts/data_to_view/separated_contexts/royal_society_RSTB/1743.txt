The first question which presents itself is this: was Cheirostrobus a Cryptogam or
a Phanerogam? The latter alternative is not one to be rejected off-hand; the
fructification might quite conceivably have been the male cone of a Gymnosperm. The remarkable morphology of the sporophylls, in fact, at once suggests a comparison
with certain Coniferous strobili. The superior and inferior lobes of the sporophyll,
especially if, as is almost certainly the case, the upper segments be the sporangio-
phores, may well be compared to the ovuliferous and carpellary scales of the
Abietineze. It is true that this would be to compare a male with a female strobilus ;
but it might be theoretically possible to suppose that an organization now limited to
flowers of one sex might in early geological times have extended to those of the
other also.
