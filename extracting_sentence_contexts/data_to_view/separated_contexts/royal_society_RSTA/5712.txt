Proofs

For reasons of space, we omit some secondary details in the following proofs; for instance we
do not write explicitly the definition of solution, the proof that energy and maximum principle
estimates are satisfied, the proof that we may pass from the weak to the mild formulation. We
only mention that the energy estimate follows by applying the Stratonovich calculus (the same as
ordinary calculus) to (1.3), while the maximum principle is a consequence of the fact that Q(x, x)
is non-negative definite for all x € D.

(a) Proof of theorem 1.2

The first key ingredient is the reformulation of the Stratonovich equation in It6 form

aT = («AT + £gT) dt +} wy VT AW,

where
(LoT)(x) = 7 uj(x) - V(uj(x) - VT(x)).

One has
Lo =LQ. This is a well-known fact, see for instance [19]; indeed

The second sum is equal to 3 Wa pet Qup (x, x)dadgT. The first one, due to the property div uj =0,
is equal to

je] wP=1 ow, p=1

where we have also used the assumptions of uniform convergence of the series of the derivatives. Recall that T(t, x) = (e'40T )(x), see (1.4); from the previous facts we have

d(T — Tg) = («A + Lo)(T — Tg) dt +) uj VT awl.

The mild formulation of this identity, furthermore applied in a weak sense to a smooth test
function ¢ with compact support in D, is

(@, TW) — To(t)) = >> i, (eeg, 4: vT()) awl,
id

where (.,-) is the inner product in L?(D) and we have also used the fact that the semigroup e('-5)4o

is self-adjoint.
