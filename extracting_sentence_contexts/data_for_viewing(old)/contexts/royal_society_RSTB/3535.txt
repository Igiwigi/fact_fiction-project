conveniently be distinguished as those of the “ early neurula” and “ late neurula”
respectively.

The details of the neural organisation of this “ neurular” stage in Ornithorhynchus
will receive full consideration in a subsequent section of this paper.

For information regarding certain other structural characters, reference must be
made to the former account by Hint and Martin. For the present we propose to
trace into this later stage the developmental history of some of the structures in and
around the embryonic area which have already occupied our attention in connection
with the anatomy of the postgastrular stage.

* We are by no means unconscious of the fact that a certain arbitrariness is involved in the
selection of such terms as “ gastrular,” “ postgastrular,” and “neurular,” in order to designate certain
assumed “stages” in the developmental process. Our chief justification must be the great convenience
resulting from the use of appellations which convey an idea of salient features of the temporary organisa-
tion of a continuously changing structural complex.


OBSERVATIONS ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF ORNITHORHYNCHUS. 93

(a) Description of Individual Specimens of Neurular Stage.

The period of development now to be considered is characterised by the differentia-
tion of evident somites, of the primary ganglionic rudiments, and of the medullary
