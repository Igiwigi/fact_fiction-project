The series investigation not only points to the existence ot different emitting
systems, but, in the light of Bour’s theory, may possibly give a clue to the nature of
the difference. The appearance of 4N in the formule for series of enhanced lines
suggests that, as in the case of proto-helium, such series are produced during the
binding of an electron by each of the atoms from which two electrons have been
removed by the exciting source ; while are series lines are emitted during the re-forma-
tion of atoms from each of which only one electron has been removed. Although
the neutral atoms of different elements contain different numbers of electrons, the
approximate constancy of N for are series, according to Borr, is explained by the
fact that the force on an electron entering a system consisting of a positive nucleus
and a number of electrons one less than that required to render it neutral would not
be very different from the force in the case of the binding of an electron by a hydrogen
atom. A similar explanation would evidently account for the constancy of 4N in the
formule for series of enhanced lines. Variations from the simple series conditions

presented by hydrogen and proto-helium would be expected in consequence of the
presence of additional electrons, but these have not yet been worked out theoretically
by Dr.
