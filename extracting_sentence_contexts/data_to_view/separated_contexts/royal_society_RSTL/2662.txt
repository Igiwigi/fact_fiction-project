In two other sets, in similar posi-
tions, it made only thirty-two vibrations in the one case, and thirty-eight in the other: Captain Back has a remark on these observations in his Narrative*, It is difficult

S to conceiye any local cause for this tendency of the needle to come 80 much quicker
£ to rest than in other cases, and I cannot but attribute it to the influence of the sunÞ.
FI The observations were made as usual in a tent, but the height of the thermometer
= clearly indicates that the 8un must have had considerable influence even under this
| 5 screen. This view of the cause of the needle s0 s00n coming to rest at Rock Rapid,
' is corroborated by the fact that, at Montreal Island © a sail was put over the tent to
SB afford more shade,” and there © the needle was particularly lively, and vibrated
'S smoothly until it finally rested,” the number of vibrations being one hundred. What-
| S ever may have been the cause which thus affected the vibration of the needle, the
r5 cireumstance must throw some uncertainty on the measure of the intensity deduced

from its time of vibration. Although I have found it necessary to make these remarks on Captain Back's ob-
servations, it cannot, I trust, be supposed that I attribute the errors which I have
pointed out to want of care or attention on the part of that most enterprising officer,
for no one can appreciate more highly than I do the zeal which he manifested for the
promotion of scientific research, by undertaking to make these observations on such
an expedition as that on which he s0 nobly volunteered.
