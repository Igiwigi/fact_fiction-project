Both Uranus and Neptune have satellites with very dark surfaces [105], this is in stark contrast
to the usually brighter satellites of gas giant planets. Lanzerotti et al. [106] suggested this might be
due to surface weathering, with Thompson eft al. [107] pointing out that darkening can result from
energetic proton weathering if the surface composition includes methane. The ion composition of
the ice giant radiation belts remains largely unknown after Voyager 2 and any further assessment
on the origin of the ice giant satellite surface composition will await future orbital missions. See
Kollmann et al. [108] and included references for additional discussion on this topic.

7. Aurora

The complex magnetic topology of the ice giants will influence the structure and location of
the planets’ auroral emissions, a fact that was exploited by Herbert [109] to improve models
of Uranus’ internal magnetic field. The auroral radio emissions from Uranus and Neptune
were found to be unexpectedly rich with a range of emissions and structures not seen at other
magnetized planets (e.g. [110,111]). Our increasing catalogue of remote auroral observations at
Uranus with the Hubble Space Telescope [57,112] might enable us to improve these yet further
and could eventually provide a way to probe how the Uranian magnetosphere evolves over time
and influences the heating of the atmosphere [113]. Voyager 2 observed very faint aurora on the
dark side of Neptune [114], but no additional detections of auroral emissions at Neptune have
been possible from Earth [115]. It is unclear how a potential auroral footprint from Triton might
be manifest, given that the moon’s orbit is highly inclined relative to the Neptune’s rotational
and magnetic axes, and the opportunity to make these observations in situ would doubtless
provide a powerful tool in the complex magnetic mapping [97]. There are many unresolved
questions regarding how these potentially complex auroral current systems would be configured
