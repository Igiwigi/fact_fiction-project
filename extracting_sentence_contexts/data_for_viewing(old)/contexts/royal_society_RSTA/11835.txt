ol t may be desirable to point out that the alteration in the relation between the
Spergy and the aperture of the ring, which is caused by an electric charge, takes
e only in the potential part of that energy. The kinetic energy of the fluid is
altered (to our order of approximation) by the electric charge.—August 29, 1895.]
