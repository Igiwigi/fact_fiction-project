HERSCHEL on the Nature and Construction

which I answer, that in the decomposition of phosphoric fluids
every other ingredient but light may also return to the body
of the sun. And that. the emission of light must waste the
Sun, is not a difficulty that can be opposed to our hypothesis. For as it is an evident fact that the sun does emit light, the
same objection, if it could be one, would equally militate
against every other assignable way to account for the phe-
nomenon. There are moreover considerations that may lessen the pres-
sure of this alleged difficulty. We know the exceeding sub-
tilty of light to be such, that in ages of time its emanation
from the sun cannot very sensibly lessen the size of this great
body.
