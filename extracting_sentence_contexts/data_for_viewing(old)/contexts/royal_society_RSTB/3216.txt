(Estrus, if I understand him aright, occurs during the period covered by the last
stages of the breaking down of the blood vessels and the first stages of the building
up of the new tissue. MarsHatt does not give the actual length of the several
periods. (Estrus is said to last for “a short period, and sometimes for only a few
hours.” The whole dicestrous cycle takes about 15 days.

Impregnation takes place in the Fallopian tube, and the ova pass into the uterus
within three days of the time of dehiscence. Dehiscence normally occurs during
cestrus, Ova, when dehisced, pass, whether fertilised or not, into the uterus
(AssHETON, 1898). ;

From the above facts it is clear that the ova arrive in the uterus during the
latest stages of the metcestrum or during the early part of the succeeding period of
rest. The time for the next procestrum would accordingly be between the 12th
and 16th days of pregnancy. It would be interesting to note whether this is
coincident with any marked changes in the uterine mucosa. However, I believe the
first serious attack made upon the tissue by the blastocyst is not until the 17th-18th
day after coition, that is to say, after cestrus; whereas the next procestrous period
would be due about 15 days after impregnation.

The Early Stages of Pregnancy—1st-16th Days.

No change is noticeable in sections of the uterus of a pregnant sheep on the third
day after coition, at which time the ova are still within the Fallopian tube; unless
