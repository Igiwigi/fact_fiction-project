The Operation Experiments 32, 33, etc., show that the removal of the testis, prior
to the temperature change, does not affect the development of the secondary sexual
characters. This is clearly due to the fact that the testes of these fish contained well-
developed interstitial tissue when they were totally castrated. Other experiments
show that if the fish is totally castrated with the interstitial tissue undeveloped, there
is no appearance of the secondary sexual characters if the fish is subjected to a suitable
temperature rise. The secretion of the interstitial tissue has therefore been produced
and is available after the removal of the testes of the fish.

The secretion of the interstitial tissue alone is not sufficient to cause the development
of the secondary sexual characters, nor is its activity conditioned by a threshold tem-
perature (p. 245). The fact that it is not necessary to maintain the temperature above
a critical value is significant, since it will be recalled that in many of the experiments
the fish was subjected to a rise of temperature prior to the full development of the
interstitial tissue.

It is evident therefore that the rise of temperature affects directly neither the inter-

stitial tissue nor the interstitial hormone, but it must act on some organ or organs to
cause them to react with the interstitial hormone.
