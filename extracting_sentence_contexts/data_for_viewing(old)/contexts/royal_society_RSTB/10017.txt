In 1720, Hermann Boerhaave re-established the supre-
macy of fire by announcing that ‘if you make a mistake in
your exposition of the Nature of Fire, your error will spread
to all the branches of physics, and this is because, in all natu-
ral production. Fire...is always the chief agent’. Pierre
Macquer’s Dictionnaire de la Chymie (1766) lamented the
persistence of Aristotelian chemistry. In his Philosophical
Inquiry into the Cause of Animal Heat (1778), Dr Patrick
Dugud Leslie resolved the ‘chymical analysis’ of living
matter into water, earth, air and phlogiston—the latest fire
surrogate [2,22].

In fact, the Enlightenment was full of residual fires. Earth

ad its central fire, the solar system its solar fire, the heavens
the celestial fire of the stars, comets and quintessential aether.
Electrical fire discharged as lightning. Inner fire provided the
life force for plants and animals, the source of animal heat.
Eccentrics like Athanasius Kircher could organize the planet
according to its pyrogeology, even if fire had morphed
from an informing principle to an organizing one. And of
course there was the ever-fascinating fire in the machine.
Even Lavoisier’s discovery of oxygen only replaced one fire
principle, phlogiston, with another, the caloric. When in the
mid-nineteenth century Michael Faraday wanted to demon-
