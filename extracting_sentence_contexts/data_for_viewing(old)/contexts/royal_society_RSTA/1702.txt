(b) The Dirichlet problem (aDP,) admits a unique solution and the Cauchy problem (aCPn,) is
wellposed.

(c) The Dirichlet operator L;, exists and the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator N;, = BL) generates a
Co-semigroup on aX.

Proof. The equivalence of (b) and (c) follows immediately from lemma 3.1 and [8, Thm. 3.1.12].
To show (a) <=> (b), we note that by lemmas 4.2 and 3.1, respectively, both assumptions (a)
and (b) imply that L, exists. Now, if u = u(-,x9) is a solution of (aP1,), then x := Lu is a solution
of (aCPy, ). Conversely, if x = x(-,x9) is a solution of (aCPy, ), then u := L,x is a solution of (aP1,).
Hence, the problem (aP1,,) admits a unique mild solution if and only if (aCPy, ) does. As pointed
out in §3b, the latter is equivalent to the fact that N, generates a Co-semigroup on 0X. This
completes the proof. |

(b) The inhomogeneous case
Having characterized the well-posedness of the homogeneous problem with dynamic boundary
conditions we now study the inhomogeneous case

Au(t)=Amu(t)+f(), #20,

(Lu)(t) =Bu(t)+g(), #20, (iaP1,)

Lu(0) = x0
for f : Ry — X and g: Ry > dX. We call u: Ry > X a classical solution of (iaP1,) if Lu: Ry > 0X is
