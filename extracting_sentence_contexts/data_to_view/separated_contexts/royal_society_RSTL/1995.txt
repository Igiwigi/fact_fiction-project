Of the Biphosphate of Soda. This salt admits, as I shall immediately show, of 80 many changes in its
constitution and properties, as to entitle it to be considered one of the most
interesting of chemical substances. The facts which I haye to communicate
on this subject-are certainly the most extraordinary of the paper, and were. de-
termined with care and considerable difficulty,

I had an opportunity of noticing the dimorphism of this salt, and confirmed
the observation of MiTscHgRLICH, that both forms of crystals possess the same
chemical properties and the same proportion of water, Of the four atoms of
water which the crystals contain, they lose, I find, two atoms at the tempera-
ture of 212?, and not a particle more till heated up to about 375*.

1st. Thus 4:96 grains of the crystals reduced to powder, when dried on the
water-bath for several days, retained only 0:76 water, or consisted of

This is as nearly as possible one half of the entire water in the crystals, which
by the mean of MrrscagRLycn's experiments consist of

2nd. 10-01 grains of the salt dried on the water-bath retained 153 water,
which is 18:04 water to 100 dry alt, or the same result as in 1?.

3rd. 50 grains of the crystals lost 6:52 grains on the water-bath ; their entire
water being by theory 12:77. There is every reason to belieye that the two atoms of water retained are
essential to the constitution of the biphosphate of soda, and that its compoxition
is expressed by the following formula,

It contains three atoms base, namely, one atom soda and two atonis water,
united to a double atom of phosphoric acid.
