is small. The sexual season of the Polecat is therefore fairly restricted and regular.*

Probably the Stoat, and perhaps also the Weasel, are moncestrous in their wild state (BELL, 1874), but
these animals do not appear to breed in captivity. Mr. Cooxs (1900), has succeeded in getting the Pine
Marten to breed in captivity, the period of cestrus probably lasting for a fortnight.t

Mr. Cocks, who has kept these animals for over 30 years, tells us that he has no doubt that they only
breed once a year.

The Otter in its wild state breeds only in the winter, according to BeLt (1874), but in captivity the
female comes in season very regularly once a month all the year round in the absence of the male (Cocks,
1881). Mr. Cocks’ subsequent experience, concerning which he has been good enough to give us
information, confirms the fact that there is no ancestrous period, about which there previously appeared to
be some doubt. In the wild state, according to Cocks, “it may be asserted with some confidence that
while the young are born during any month of the year, yet that more litters are born between October
and February, both inclusive, than during the remaining seven months.” Mr. Cocks adds that he has no
doubt that the Otter only breeds once in about a twelvemonth.} SouTHWELL (1888), states his belief that
the Otter in the wild state, as a general rule only breeds in winter, but that it occasionally breeds also at
other times.

The various species of Seals are very regular in their breeding habits and are almost certainly
moneestrous, having one litter of pups annually.§ In the case of the Harp Seal the estrous cycle appears
to have attained to an almost perfect rhythmic regularity, for from Greenland to the north-east of
Newfoundland where this species occurs in abundance, the pups are stated to be born each year between
March 8 and March 10. But HinpEMAN says that at Jan Mayen the pups are not born until about
