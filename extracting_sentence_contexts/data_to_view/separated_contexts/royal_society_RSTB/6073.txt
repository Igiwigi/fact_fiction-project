The remains of the plant are replaced by
a brownish-orange granular material. The individual leaves thus stand out clearly
against the dark matrix, and some of them show the tapering terminal region. The interest of the specimen in fig. 4, Plate 29, lies in the fact that it was collected
from the Monograptus Beds at one of the Thomson River exposures. Its registration
number is 1144, and it therefore comes in the list of fossils that include graptolites,
from Locality E (BARAGWANATH, 1925). The appressed leaves in the upper part give
the impression of having been rather erect and slender.
