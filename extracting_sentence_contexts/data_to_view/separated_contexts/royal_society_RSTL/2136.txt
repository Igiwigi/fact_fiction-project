FARADAY on. the mutual action of sulphuric acid

to rise, the red colour became deep brown, and then a sudden
action commenced at the bottom of the tube, which spread
over the whole, and the acid became black and opaque. Continuing the heat, naphthaline, sulphurous acid, and char-
coal were evolved; but even after some time the residuum
examined by water and carbonate of baryta, was found to
contain a portion of the peculiar acid undecomposed, unless
the temperature had been raised to redness. These facts establish the peculiarity of this acid, and dis-
tinguish it from all others. In its solid state it is generally
a hydrate containing much combustible matter. It is readily
80luble in water and alcohol, and its solutions forms neutral
salts with bases, all of which are soluble in water, most of
them in alcohol, and all combustible, leaving sulphates or
sulphurets according to circumstances.
