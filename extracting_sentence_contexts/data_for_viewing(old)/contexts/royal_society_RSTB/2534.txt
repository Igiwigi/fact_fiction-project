sporophyte was read by Professor Ramsay Wricut at the May meeting of the
Royal Society of Canada, 1896 (‘A Theory of the Morphology of Stelar Structures,”
‘Proceedings of the Royal Society of Canada,’ p. 106). A further abstract was
published in 1897 (‘ Report Brit. Assoc., Toronto,’ 1897). On account of the extent
of the subject and the difficulty of securing material of fossilized and tropical forms,
it has been necessary to publish the work in parts. The first of these appeared in
1899, and was devoted to the Equisetacee (‘Boston Nat. Hist. Memoirs,’ vol. 5,
No. 5). The second, published in 1900, dealt with the Angiosperms (“ Morphology of
Central Cylinder in the Angiosperms,” ‘Canadian Inst. Trans.,’ vol. 6).

It is proposed to deal in the present memoir with the remaining Vasculares, and to
draw such theoretical conclusions concerning vascular plants in general as seem
justified by the facts described in the present and former articles. It will be
convenient to consider first the Filicales, and subsequently the Lycopodiales and
Gymnosperms.

The investigations recorded here have been rendered possible by the kindness of
many botanists in supplying material otherwise inaccessible to the writer, and
acknowledgment is made of these favours in connection with the various groups.

Marattiacee.—The fibro-vascular system of the Marattiaces is very complex in
the adult. By study of the young plant, however, it becomes easily intelligible.
