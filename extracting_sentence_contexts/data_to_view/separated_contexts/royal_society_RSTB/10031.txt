Similar differences in
grass species composition, potentially detectable by remote
sensing, have also been reported for old growth versus
secondary grasslands in South America [49].

6. Conclusion

As the threat of climate change and the increasing pressure
on vegetated systems from human-related activities increases,
restoration has become a top global priority, especially in
forested areas [3,4]. Our work adds to case studies elsewhere

[21] in suggesting that unchecked ‘reforestation’ of ‘degraded’
lands, which are in fact ‘old growth’ grasslands, poses a
serious threat to the biodiversity of grassy systems. Our
results show that identification of natural grassy systems is
technically possible. However, further regional studies are
needed to help distinguish old growth from secondary grass-
lands elsewhere when making decisions as to where to
conserve ancient grasslands.
