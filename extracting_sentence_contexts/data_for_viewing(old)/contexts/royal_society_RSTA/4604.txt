The strike of a cosmic body is governed by a slew of complex processes (e.g. [23,24]) that can
simply be ascribed to the hypervelocity of the impact itself (about 18kms~!). The main result
of the hypervelocity impact is the formation of a crater that is a consequence of the generation
of shockwaves. Shockwaves are waves whose speed is greater than the speed of sound for the
material through which they travel. This paper focuses on the tsunami waves generated during
an impact in the marine environment; however, a basic comprehension of shockwaves and crater
mechanics is essential for a better understanding of the different generation mechanisms of
tsunami-like waves. Figure 1 depicts the generation of tsunami waves after the vertical impact
of a body into deep (left) and shallow (right) water.

To describe the processes that result in the formation of craters and tsunami waves, meteorite
impacts are often compared to the detonation of explosives. It might not be intuitively clear why
an explosion is an appropriate analogue for studying hypervelocity impacts. The fact, however,
