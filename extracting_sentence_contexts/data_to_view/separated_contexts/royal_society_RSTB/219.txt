and hence, though rare, it is represented about the same region as is the equally
rare movement of flexion of the small toes, z.c., close to the fissure of Ronanpo. This,
as we have pointed out before, is the focus of representation of the limb, and perhaps
the rare movements of extension and rotation in, which occur at the centres :—

owe their representation to the fact that, this being the middle of the lower limb area,
the cortex here is most highly organised, and thus possesses centres for every move-
ment of all the joints.

(b.) Primary.—The 10 primary movements of the knee were all flexion, with one
exception, viz., rotation in,

The hip is thus represented must in the middle or focus of the lower limb area,
moving altogether 177 times. MOTOR REGION OF THE CORTEX CEREBRI IN THE MONKEY, 227

(ii.) Primary Representation.—The hip is primarily represented in the following
centres in order of diminishing intensity :—

54, 76, 75, ie i 55, soa 52, 59, 61. We must first call attention to the important deduction which these figures reveal,
namely, that the hip is primarily represented in but 11 out of the 23 centres of its
total or absolute representation ; further that the centres, where it was observed to
move primarily, are exactly the counterpart of those where the hallux is especially
™ primarily represented.
