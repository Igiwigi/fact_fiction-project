The usual method of representing the results of a series of observations like the
present is to adopt an empirical formula of the type,

s=1+ai+ bP +e +dtit+&k&e, . ... . . (8),

and to calculate the values of the coefficients a, b, c, d, &e., by the method of least
squares. This was, in fact, the method adopted by Liipry. â€˜It has the advantage of
providing a simple and ready rule, which is very generally recognized and applied ;
but it appears to me that it is in reality liable to several objections. Too much
weight is given to the observations at higher temperatures, which are necessarily less
accurate than the rest.
