1. Origin and regulation of motor rhythms

Neurons and neural circuits with intrinsic oscillatory activities underlie rhyth-
micity of motor behaviours, from respiration, heartbeat, gastric motility to
locomotion [1-5]. In the absence of rhythmic inputs from the descending
neural networks or sensory organs, isolated vertebrate spinal cords, and their
invertebrate counterpart, the ventral nerve cords, retain a capacity to generate
rhythmic and patterned motor neuron activity or fictive locomotion [6-10]. Hence oscillators for locomotory activities reside within the spinal or ventral
nerve cords, where premotor interneurons form local circuits with excitatory
motor neurons to orchestrate motor outputs [1,2,11]. Selective recruitment, modulation and coordination of locomotory oscillators
constitute the form and transit between different motor patterns.
