It does not appear, however, that either the experimental investigations of these
motions or the theoretical explanations of the properties revealed have hitherto been
in any sense complete.

730 PROFESSOR O. REYNOLDS ON CERTAIN DIMENSIONAL

There exists a whole class of yery marked phenomena which have escaped the
notice of GRAHAM and 8ubsequent observers ; while several of the most marked and
important facts discovered by GRAHAM have hitherto remained unconnected by any
theory. 7

2. Amongst the best known of the phenomena is the difference in the rates at
which different gases transpire through minute channels, and the consequent difference
of pressure which ensues when two different gases initially at the same pressure are
eparated by a porous plate. It does not appear, however, that hitherto any attempt
has been made to ascertain the existence of what may be considered a closely analogous
phenomenon—that a difference of temperature on the two sides of the plate might
cause gas, without any initial difference of pressure or any difference in chemical con-
stitution, to pass through the plate—nor am I aware that such a result from a difference
of temperature has been in any way surmised (see Appendix, note 1).
