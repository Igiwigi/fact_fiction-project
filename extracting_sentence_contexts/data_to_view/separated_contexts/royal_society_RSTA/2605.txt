Grain boundaries between adjacent plagioclase grains are a mixture
of planar boundaries that are parallel to growth faces of one or both of the two grains (e.g.
figure 6b,e), or are irregular, with no relationship with the crystallographic orientation of the
two grains. This irregular type contains impingement lenses (figure 6câ€”e). That the irregularities
in the grain boundaries formed during solidification itself is shown by the fact that planar
facets are present on plagioclase grains adjacent to relatively large pools of melt, but this planar
morphology breaks down as the melt film between adjacent grains is narrowed during continuing
