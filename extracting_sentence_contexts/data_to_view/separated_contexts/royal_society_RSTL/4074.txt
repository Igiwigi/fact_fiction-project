Let R be any point,
and let OR

Through R draw three planes, parallel respectively to the three coordinate planes,
and intersecting the axes respectively in the points X, Y, Z. Also, on OR, as a dia-
meter, describe a sphere, intersecting the axes respectively in U, V, W. Then will
ON=a,OY=9, n.0Z=z
be the coordinates of R, as usnal, and
OU=u, OV=v, OW=w
its contraordinates, being, in fact, the projections of OR on the three axes. For rectangular axes, coordinates and contraordinates are identical. Coordinates and Contraordinates are connected þby the following equation :—
V=unFoy FW.
