improved this to show that dimy(S) <1. These results are valid for a weak solutions that also
satisfy a localized version of the energy inequality, termed ‘suitable weak solutions’ in [17]. The

°For a solution u with Jj Jo |u(x,1)|4 < 00, Prodi [27] proved uniqueness under this condition; in [22] Serrin showed that
under this condition alone a solution w is unique in the class of all weak solutions that satisfy the energy inequality. In [28],
Serrin proved a local conditional regularity result: if u € L'(h, fy; L°(U)) for some 2/r + 3/s <1 then w is smooth in space in the
space-time domain (t1, fy) x U; the proof of this result is much harder (and that in the case 2/r +3/s =1, due to Fabes et al.
[29] and Struwe [30], harder still).


argument there shows that if (x, f) is a singular point then the solution u must satisfy certain lower
bounds on its rate of blow-up near (x,t); as in the previous section this can be coupled with the
fact that certain integrals of the solution are finite to obtain bounds on the dimension of S. (For a
simplified version of their argument, neglecting the pressure, see [34].)

Robinson & Sadowksi showed in [35] that it is an easy corollary of the results in [17] that the
box-counting dimension of the singular set is no larger than! 5/3, and as a consequence were
able to prove that for any particular suitable weak solution there is a unique particle trajectory for
almost every initial condition: even when the solution is only ‘weak’, the Lagrangian formulation
of the dynamics still makes sense. (The proof combines an argument due to Foias et al. [37] that
produces a volume-preserving particle flow for any weak solution, with a dynamical result that
for almost any initial condition such a flow must avoid the singular set. The almost-everywhere
uniqueness follows relatively easily.)
