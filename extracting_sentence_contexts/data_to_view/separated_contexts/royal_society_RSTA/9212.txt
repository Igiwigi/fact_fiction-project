The tube was
placed in an electric furnace, and the temperature observed by a platinum platinum-
rhodium thermocouple placed as close as possible to the vacuum tube in the neigh-
bourhood of the specimen. Steels A and B were heated slowly to 900Â° C., and main-
tained at that temperature (as recorded by the thermocouple) for half an hour. This
is rather longer than might appear necessary for a normalising process, but owing to
the fact that the surface remained untarnished, and was consequently highly reflecting,
the specimen would take longer to reach the furnace temperature. The tube was then
withdrawn, and the specimen allowed to cool by radiation. In the case of steel C the specimens were allowed to cool in the furnace.
