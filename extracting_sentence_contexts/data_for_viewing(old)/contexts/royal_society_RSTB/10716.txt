are the same qualitatively, but they differ quantitatively,
and the quantitative differences reveal important changes or
deficits in cognitive control.

3. Independent race model

Two facts led to the independent race model of stop-signal per-
formance: (i) the probability of response inhibition depends on
the time available to detect the stop signal before the Go
response is executed and (ii) non-cancelled RTs are faster
than RTs on no-stop-signal trials. These characteristics are
found in the large majority but not all studies of countermand-
ing [6,7]. These two facts suggested that response inhibition
depends on the outcome of a race between a GO process,
initiated by the Go stimulus, and a STOP process, initiated
by the stop signal. If the STOP process finishes before the GO
process, the response is inhibited, producing a cancelled trial.
If the GO process finishes before the STOP process, the
response is not inhibited, producing a non-cancelled trial.
The model assumes that the finishing times for the STOP and
GO processes are independent random variables, and demon-
strates that the fundamental results in the stop-signal paradigm
follow from these assumptions (figure 3).

The independent race model provides a measure of the
