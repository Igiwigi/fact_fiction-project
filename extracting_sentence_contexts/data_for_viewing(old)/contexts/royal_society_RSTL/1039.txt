Mr. Rozxs's theory supposes that all the powder of which
a charge consists is not only set on fire, but that it is actually
consumed and © converted into an elastic fluid before the bullet
« 7s sensibly moved from its place.” 1 have already in the for-
mer part of this paper offered several reasons which appeared
to me to prove that, though the inflammation of gunpowder is
very rapid, yet the progress of the combustion is by no means
80 instantaneous as has been imagined. IT shall now give an
account of some experiments which put that matter out of all
doubt.

It is a fact well known that on the discharge of fire-arms of
all Kinds, cannon and mortars as well as muskets, there is al-
ways a considerable quantity of unconsumed grains of gun-
powder blown out of them; and, what is very remarkable, and
*as it leads directly to a discovery of the cause of this effect is
highly deserving of 'consideration, these unconsumed grains
'arenot merely blown -out of the muzzles of fire-arms ; they
come'out also by their vents' or touch-holes, where the fire en-
ters to nflame the charge ; 'as many persons who have had the
misfortune to stand with their faces near the touch-hole of a
musket, when it has been discharged, have found to their cost.

Now it appears to me to be extremely improbable, if not ab-
