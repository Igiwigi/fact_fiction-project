7. Current and near-term improvements in pulsar timing precision

Founded during a meeting in 2010, over the rest of this decade the IPTA (www.ipta4gw.org),
a collaboration of the three main regional pulsar timing arrays, the EPTA, NANOGrav and the
PPTA, has been working together on searching for GWs. This consortium of consortia has at
its heart the aim of combining the data from the eight large telescopes that currently make
up the regional PTAs. In 2016, this came to fruition with the first IPTA data release, which
included data on 49 millisecond pulsars with data spans ranging from 5 to 21 years [32].
Combining the data from the eight PTA telescopes around the world not only improved the
cadence of the observations, which were as frequent as every 3 days, but also gave a broader
range of observing frequencies. In fact, some pulsars in the combined datasets are regularly
observed at five frequencies. Significant progress was made on understanding and prescribing
how these disparate datasets can best be combined [32]. A second data release is planned for
2018, which will combine the data from the most recent updates from the individual PTAs. This
release will combine data of significantly higher quality from a number of observatories which


have improved front-ends and/or back-ends and will use the most up-to-date noise analysis 6 |
techniques (e.g. [33]).

As well as requiring an increase in the number of pulsars to be included in the PTAs to achieve â€œa
a detection, we need to continue to improve pulsar timing precision. This is essential for the 78
improved gravity tests and also plays a vital role even when entering the intermediate regime of :s
