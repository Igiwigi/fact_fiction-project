Participants were informed that the group
of lines with a common orientation could be any number of
lines, and that the lines did not have to be next to one another
to be considered part of the group.

or gist-based representations [19]. In other words, rather than
encoding details in the periphery with high fidelity, visual
information is compressed to eliminate redundancy and rep-
resent information outside the fovea in the form of summary
statistics [14]. Considering the results from Experiment 1, it is
an intriguing question how summary statistical judgement
may be biased by the fact that individual crowded items
may nonetheless provide a subjectively reliable percept, so
that all the items together may subjectively look as if they
are more coherent than they really are. In Experiment 2, we investigated whether such detection
biases exist in the periphery. On each trial, we presented
observers with a diamond-shaped stimulus composed of
many individual lines with various orientations (figure 4).
