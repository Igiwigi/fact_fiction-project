Possessing at the time no means of fixing a
sunbeam of large area, I operated coarsely with a prism placed horizontally. The
light was introduced through a narrow slit, and the time chosen for experiment when
the sun was on the meridian, s0 that no motion of the spectrum in the direction of
its length might confound the result. This arrangement proved, as indeed I ex-
pected, quite inadequate to the end proposed ; but it sufficed to reveal several lead-
ing facts, viz. 1st, That with the paper employed (which happened to be a specimen
prepared by the process in art. 31. on Mr. Tarsor's principle) the maximum of ac-
tion was not beyond the violet, as I had always understood it to be, but rather about
the confines of the blue and green, nearly where Frauxnorrr's ray F is situated.
2ndly, That the extent of the chemical spectrum beyond the visible violet light far
surpassed any idea I had previously formed of it. For, in fact, the visible termination
of the violet rays nearly bisected the photographic image impressed on the paper.
3rdly, That # the visible violet rays there occurred a sort of minimum of action,
about one third of the way from Frauxnorer's ray H towards G. 4thly, That the
whole of the red, up to about Frauxnore's line C, appeared to be inactive.
