When the pupa is suspended to a wall the gilded appearance is not produced, and the
pupa is of a mottled greyish colour. This observation is very important, for it
contained the obvious implication that the metallic appearance may be controlled by
the surroundings, as I have now proved it to be. In fact, Mr. Woop states, “I feel
convinced that by the proper use of gilded surfaces the gilded chrysalides of Vanessa,
and perhaps of other genera, would be obtained, and I hope to be able to try the
experiment next season.” I was not aware of Mr. Woop’s last suggestion in 1867
when I undertook my experiments on the subject in 1886, and the arguments which
induced me to make use of gilded surfaces are given at the beginning of the experi-
ments. It certainly does seem strange that so remarkable, although so bold, a
suggestion should not have been subjected to any test for nearly twenty years.
