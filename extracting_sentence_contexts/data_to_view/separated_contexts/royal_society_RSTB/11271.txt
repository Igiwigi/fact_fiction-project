This analysis reveals an interesting feature of moral con-
cepts already noted by Hume [21]. Unlike some concepts
that merely represent how the world is, moral concepts tell
us how the world should be, and, as such they have behav-
ioural pull. We can observe that an object is green and be
indifferent to that fact, but if we observe that an object is
litter, we are not indifferent. That observation motivates us
to change it. The felt badness of something tells us both
how it is (bad) and that something must be done to rectify
it.
