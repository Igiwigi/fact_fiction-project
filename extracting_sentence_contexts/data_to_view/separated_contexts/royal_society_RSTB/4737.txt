Upon referring to Plate 10, fig. 3, it will
be seen that the mass of the rete lies between the cesophagus and a dense non-
extensile layer of peritoneum (pt.). Close above the cesophagus is the vertebra
column,


BLOOD-VASCULAR SYSTEM OF THE PORBEAGLE SHARK (LAMNA CORNUBICA). 253

The dilatation of the esophagus caused by swallowing food, which in the case of
this shark consists of fish of some size, would undoubtedly compress the rete against
its peritoneal covering from before backwards, forcing blood from it into the visceral
arteries, and thus flooding the stomach and other alimentary viscera preparatory to the
processes of digestion. Tn making the above suggestions on the possible action of the series of retia that occur
in Lamna, I do so naturally with very great hesitation, owing to the inadequacy and
purely anatomical character of the facts upon which they are based. It seems, however,
fairly clear that their main object is, as suggested by Carazzi and others, to provide
a stabilising head of blood, to ensure that a given part should constantly receive the
optimum supply. In view of the poor arterial propulsion and low pressure in the
arteries of fishes it does not seem likely that they are needed or used to neutralise the
shock of sudden increases in pressure, as has generally been assuthed ; in fact the
opposite is more likely the case, to guard against temporary diminution of the supply
and consequent local anzemia.
