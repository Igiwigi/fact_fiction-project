The main results of the research program are summarized in table 1. The main conclusion is
that so far our search based on the enstrophy and the Ladyzhenskaya—Prodi-Serrin conditions
(1.4) and (1.5) has revealed no indication of singularity formation in three-dimensional Navier-
Stokes flows with the optimal initial conditions. However, the behaviour exhibited by these
different extreme flows in terms of the maximum growth of enstrophy is in fact similar, cf.
figure 5a, and analogous to what was found in one-dimensional Burgers flows, cf. (2.7), (4.4)
and figure 1b. The results discussed in §3 demonstrated the sharpness of a number of a priori
estimates on the growth of palinstrophy in two dimensions, both instantaneously and in finite
time. We remark that the power-law structure of estimates (1.10), (3.5) and of the empirical relation
(4.4) can be justified with simple arguments based on dimensional analysis [13,28,73].
