2. In the embryos of Lizards the anus is still round, and not a transverse slit. On
each side, the lateral inner walls of the proctodseum are, together with part of the
uro-anal fold F, raised up into prominent cones, which afterwards are invaginated and
withdrawn into the post-anal region of the tail by the action of specialised muscles.
Tn connexion with this the anal opening assumes its typical transverse shape.

In the Snakes, which are the most specialised branch of the Saurian stock, the
original position of the penes is ccenogenetically obscured, although still traceable.

3. The original duplicity of the “ unpaired” copulatory organ of the other Amniota
is still indicated by the nerve supply, the vascular supply, by the corpora cavernosa
s. crura penis, by the double penis and clitoris of certain Marsupials, like Didelphys,
and by the fact that in the Chelonia the peritoneal canals are continued far into the
lateral portions of the penis.

4. The completely divided right and left penes of the Lizards and Snakes are
supplied by the same nerves as are the copulatory organs in all the other Sauropida.

These circumstances, considering also the modifications of the cloaca as described in
this paper, seem to me to permit the following conclusions :—

That in all Amniota the intromittent organs, no matter if double or single, are
derived from the walls of the outermost cloacal chamber, in connexion with the
