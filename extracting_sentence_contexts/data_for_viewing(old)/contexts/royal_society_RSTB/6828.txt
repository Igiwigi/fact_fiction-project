which they will withstand.

The clinical results obtained by mixture of pure strains has been studied, evidence is
given that a tenfold excess of a weak over a strong may lead to the clinical masking of
the latter in the host plant; a lesser relation of strong to weak has the opposite
result.

The double reactions that ensue from mixtures of the different X strains with the
Y virus, the A virus and tobacco mosaic virus respectively, conform to the actual
differences in virulence of the different strains themselves.

The reactions resulting from mixtures of the various strains of the XY virus with three
distinct variants of tobacco mosaic virus disclose the fact that the strains YX” X° X4 and
X? all behave ir a similar manner in the presence of the tobacco strains. An explana-
tion is offered.

Conversion of one strain to another has been studied both in material which is
relatively pure to strain as well as in that which we have good reason to believe is in
reality pure. In both conversions have taken place. Conversions have been effected
by passage through certain unrelated plants.

All conversions, whether purposely designed or not, have been from the more to the
less virulent strain.

The nature of these conversions is discussed and the conclusion reached that they
