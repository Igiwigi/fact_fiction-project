EXPLANATION OF THE PLATES.

All the figures where the magnifying power is not stated were drawn with a power
of 160 diameters (Zx18s, Oc. 1, Obj. D) ; but the actual amplification of the drawings
is not uniform. In copying the original sketches it has been convenient to reduce
the 8ize of 8ome of them, and no inference as to relative size should be drawn from
any of them except where measurements are given.

In order to render the figures as truthful and lifelike as possible, the animals were
8ubjected to very little confinement while under examination, and as their incessant
