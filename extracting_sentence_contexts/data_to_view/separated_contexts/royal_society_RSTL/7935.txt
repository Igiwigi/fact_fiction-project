In like manner, if we take the three-monthly curyes as equalizing any influence
due to the relative positions of Venus and Mercury, and lay down the departures of the
fortnightly means from the corresponding three-monthly means, We are thus furnished
with another set of departures which we may suppose likely to exhibit any influence
due to the relative positions of Venus and Mercury. But these departures of yery
short period will no doubt embody, as well as inequalities due to physical causes, others

due to the fact that large groups come abruptly into view, and depart abruptly from the
disk of the sun, 80 that a high positive departure for one fortnight is 80ometimes followed
by a negative one for the next. We have endeayoured to eliminate the effect of this source of inequality by the fol.
lowing means. Suppose, for instance, that the departures for the beginning of 1850 are
as follows :—
