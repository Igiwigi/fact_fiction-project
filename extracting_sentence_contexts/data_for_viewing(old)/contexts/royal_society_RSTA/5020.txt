Observations of the ISM reveal a Kolmogorov spectrum of electron density fluctuations [49,50] is
as well as steeper spectral slopes of supersonic velocity fluctuations (see [51] for a review).
Measurements of the solar wind fluctuations also reveal turbulence power spectrum [52].
Ubiquitous non-thermal broadening of spectral lines as well as measures obtained by other
techniques [53] confirm that turbulence is present everywhere in astrophysical environments

where we test for its existence. This is not surprising as magnetized astrophysical plasmas
generally have very large Reynolds numbers due to the large length scales involved and the

fact that the motions of charged particles in the direction perpendicular to magnetic fields are
constrained. Laminar plasma flows at these high Reynolds numbers are prey to numerous linear

and finite-amplitude instabilities, from which turbulent motions readily develop.!

Indeed, observations show that turbulence is ubiquitous in all astrophysical plasmas. The
spectrum of electron density fluctuations in the Milky Way is presented in figure 1, but similar
examples are discussed in [52,57] for solar wind, [58] for molecular clouds and [59] for the
intracluster medium. The plasma turbulence is sometimes driven by an external energy source,
such as supernovae in the ISM [60,61], merger events and active galactic nuclei outflows in the
intercluster medium [62-64], and baroclinic forcing behind shock waves in interstellar clouds.
In other cases, the turbulence is spontaneous, with available energy released by a rich array
of instabilities, such as magneto-rotational instability in accretion discs [65], kink instability of
