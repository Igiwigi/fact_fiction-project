ticular cases in detail with the aid of a digital computer. This method has the advantage
that it is not so necessary to make simplifying assumptions as it is when doing a more
theoretical type of analysis. It might even be possible to take the mechanical aspects of the
problem into account as well as the chemical, when applying this type of method. The
essential disadvantage of the method is that one only gets results for particular cases. But
this disadvantage is probably of comparatively little importance. Even with the ring
problem, considered in this paper, for which a reasonably complete mathematical analysis
was possible, the computational treatment of a particular case was most illuminating. The
morphogen theory of phyllotaxis, to be described, as already mentioned, in a later paper,
will be covered by this computational method. Non-linear equations will be used.

It must be admitted that the biological examples which it has been possible to give in
the present paper are very limited. This can be ascribed quite simply to the fact that
biological phenomena are usually very complicated. Taking this in combination with the
relatively elementary mathematics used in this paper one could hardly expect to find that
many observed biological phenomena would be covered. It is thought, however, that the
imaginary biological systems which have been treated, and the principles which have been
discussed, should be of some help in interpreting real biological forms.
