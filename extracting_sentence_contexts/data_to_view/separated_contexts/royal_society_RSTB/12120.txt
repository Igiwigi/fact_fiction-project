Although most single-cell studies are performed on fresh specifically for single-cell analyses was the Fluidigm Cl
cells, several chemicals have been employed to try to preserve system [40]. Although it is not possible to select cells, the C1
native cell states in animal samples, including methanol [31], system allows imaging of each capture site for the presence
dimethylsulfoxide [32], crosslinkers that require later reverse of single cells and their viability [41]. Fluidigm C1 has been
cross-linking such as paraformaldehyde [33] and dithio-bis- successfully used to isolate single cells of unicellular algae

(succinimidyl propionate) [34], and proprietary reagents for RNA sequencing or quantitative polymerase chain reaction

Figure 1. Overview of the main steps and alternative strategies in single-cell RNA sequencing methods. (a,b) Biological samples taken from the laboratory or the
field are either processed immediately or preserved for later use. (c,d) A variety of single-cell isolation platforms provide different throughput and possibilities to
characterize individual cells. (e,f) Each single cell is usually lysed in its own compartment, and the targeted RNA is converted to cDNA, tagged with a specific cell
barcode to identify the cellular origin of each RNA molecule. Various library preparation protocols offer different options for transcript quantification, coverage, and
fragmentation, signal amplification, adapter ligation, and barcoding strategies, which depend on the sequencing technology (g) as well as the study design.
