approximately represent equal differences of pressure of the atmospheric CO,,
and also the lines of flow perpendicular to them.*

These shells must vary in density outwards from zero at the absorbent surface,
if this is perfectly absorbent, to a density corresponding to the maximum pressure
of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, a point which theoretically is at infinite
distance from the disc, but which is practically reached at a distance of five or six
times its diameter. If we had two such figures of different sizes, drawn to relative
seale, one in fact the magnified image of the other, any curved surface corresponding
to a given density would be found at actual distances from the dises which would be
proportional to their diameters. This, of course, means that the gradient of density,
on the magnitude of which the flow into unit area depends, must vary inversely as
the diameters of the discs, a result sufficient to account for all the observed facts.

The case of such an absorbent disc as we have been considering is the exact
converse of one which has been theoretically explored by Sreran (‘ Wien. Akad. Ber.,’
1881, vol. 83, Abtheil. 2, p. 613), the conditions of evaporation from a circular surface
of liquid. He also makes use of the electrostatic analogy, and the results of his
mathematical analysis show that the amount of evaporation in such cases is propor-
tional to the linear dimensions of the liquid surface, and not, as is commonly supposed,
to its area, The lines of flux of the vapour proceeding from the liquid he finds to be
hyperbolas, whose foci lie in the bounding edge of the circular surface. The curved
surfaces of equal pressure of the vapour overlying the disc form an orthogonal system
of ellipsoids, also having their foci in the edge of the disc, and since these ellipsoids
come closer together at the margin than they do nearer the middle of the liquid disc
