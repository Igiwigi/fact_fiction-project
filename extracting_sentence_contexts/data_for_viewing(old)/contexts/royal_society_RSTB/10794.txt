in the wild are faced with multifarious demands, such as
searching for sustenance and mates, and defending against
competitors and predators, which limit the amount of time
available for sleep. In stark contrast, the laboratory is a seem-
ingly simple environment wherein many of the challenges
faced by wild animals are removed and new challenges are
introduced. For example, laboratory-housed animals do not
need much time to forage, because food and water are typ-
