have been shown to occur regularly, though more sparingly, on the type of axis that
bore the sporangia. Unfortunately no material is available to allow of these latter
spines being similarly and fully studied, and we are limited to observing their appearance
in the hand-specimens by reflected light. It has been pointed out that, as thus seen,
they usually show a peculiar blunt or truncated distal end. In the light of what is
known of the spines on the other type of stem the question may be raised whether this
may not indicate a natural incompleteness or opening of the tip. No solution of this
problem is, however, possible at present.

The next extension of comparisons is naturally to those remains from other regions
that, from their general characters in hand-specimens, have been referred with more or
less confidence to Psilophyton princeps or to some closely related species. Here again
in the case of such specimens from Norway and France the corresponding facts have not
yet been ascertained and detailed comparison is therefore at present impossible. But

* This condition is realised in the remains named Psilophyton Goldschmidti (Haun, 1916.)


SPORES OF PSILOPHYTON PRINCEPS, DAWSON. 437

so far as the appendages borne on some Scottish specimens of this kind are concerned
I can state generally, from investigations that are in progress, that they agree in all main
features with the Gasp√© specimens described here. This particularly applies to the
peculiarities of the terminal region of the spines. On the question of specific identity
it will, of course, be necessary to take other characters into consideration. Some of
