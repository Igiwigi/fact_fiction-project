Thus, as curvature is increased the contribution of
the surface energy increases, and the offset of the access surface energy is balanced by a reduced
melting point, i.e. an increase in the free energy difference between the water and ice. The Gibbs—
Thomson equation for ice is given by Liu et al. [25]

T(t) = Tet — K, (ly)

r
where r is the radius of the curvature, and T;(r) and T#!#' are the freezing temperatures for the
curved surface of radius r and for the flat surface, respectively. The curvature is originated by the
fact that the ice is confined to grow between the AFPs on the surface.

(b) Moderate versus hyperactive antifreeze proteins

AFPs can be divided into two categories: moderate and hyperactive. Moderate AFPs, such as
type III AFPs (AFPIII), reduce the freezing point by a maximum of 1.5K at mM concentrations
(figure 1) while hyperactive AFPs, such as Tenebrio molitor AFPs (TmAFP), can reduce the
freezing point by over 3K at a 0.1mM concentration (figure 2). Following which, we describe
the mechanism for TH activity for each AFP category.
