heres (C'*.), and is behind the quadrate bone ; the other parts are similar to
in the last two sections. Section 13.—Here (Plate 35, fig. 10) the hemispheres (C"*.) are wider, and with them
he cranial cavity, whose walls are thinner, and laterally are partly ossified ; these bones
ight and left, are the lateral ethmoids (7.eth.); they were not seen in the dissection of
_ specimen of this stage ; (2 inches long, Plate 34 ; the one sectioned was
*22 inches) ; but these bones are figured in the dissection of the next stage (Plate 38,
figs. 2, 3). Looking at the base of the cranial axis in this and the last three or four sections,

-we 8ee that the parasphenoid (pa.s.) fits to a cartilaginous mass having a trilobate
= below ; this arises from the fact that it was formed by the coalescence of three
Zeartilages, viz. : the trabeculz and the intertrabecula. SZ Section 14.—The hemispheres in this section (Plate 35, fig. 11, C'".) are rapidly
| [aidening, and the cranial walls are now deficient, the sides being membranous—the
Sorbito- sphenoidal fenestra—in the lower half. The tegmen eranii (t.cr.) runs down
EE the sides half way, and is grooved above; the lower edge of the cartilage just touches
'Zthe optic nerve (II.).
