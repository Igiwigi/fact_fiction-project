Soc. Proc.,’ loc. cit.) that the nuclei
requiring expansions between 1°25 and 1°37 to make condensation take place on them
ave to be identified with the ions, to which the conductivity of gases exposed to
X-rays or Uranium-rays is due. The only evidence there furnished for this view was _
the fact that in ordinary moist air or other gases such nuclei were found to be present
in exceedingly small numbers, while when the gas was made a conductor by being
exposed to X-rays or Uranium-rays, immense numbers of these nuclei could be
detected. The experiments with the nuclei produced by the discharge from a pointed platinum
wire, as well as with those which are produced by the exposure of a negatively
charged zine plate to ultra-violet light, support this view, at the same time pointing
to the conclusion that in all these cases the carriers of the electricity are of the same
kind. A difficulty, however, is introduced by the results obtained with air exposed to
weak ultra-violet light or to the action of certain metals, for in both cases nuclei are
produced, requiring, in order that water may condense on them, a degree of super-
saturation approximately the same as is required in the case of nuclei associated with
conducting power in the gas.
