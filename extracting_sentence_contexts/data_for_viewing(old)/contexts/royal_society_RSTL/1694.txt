were 80 nicely balanced, that the chlorine was nearly equally
divided between them. And that the attraction of chlorine for
both these gasses is nearly the same, appears to be confirmed
by muriatic acid not being decomposed by carbonic oxide, or
the new gas by hydrogene.

The chlorine and carbonic oxide are, it is evident from these
last facts, united by strong attractions; and as the properties of
the substance as a peculiar compound are well characterized,
it will be necessary to designate it by some simple name, I
venture to propose that of phosgene, or phosgene gas; from
@u;, light, and ywpa, to produce, which signifies formed by
light; and as yet no other mode of producing it has been dis-
covered.

I have exposed mixtures consisting of different proportions
of chlorine and carbonig acid to light, but have obtained no
new compound.

The proportions in which bodies combine appear to be de-
