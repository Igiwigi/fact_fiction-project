have been reduced to a mathematical expression, and although it may be 80 small that
our present, methods of experimenting haye not yet detected it, it must have some
value; and it is desirable 80 to select the limits of the water-line as to make that value
as small as possible. In order that the abrupt change of motion may take place in as
small a mass of water as possible, it would seem that the limits of the water-line
employed in practice should be at or near the point of slowest gliding; that is, where
the water-line curye is cut by the trajectory of slowest gliding LN, in Plate VIIL fig. 1,
and Plate IX. fig. 3, as explained in articles 14, 15, and 16; and that conclusion is borne
out, by the figures of many vessels remarkable for economy of power.

(26.) Preferable Figures of Water-Lines.—In forming a probable opinion as to which,
out, of all the water-lines generated by a given oval, is to be preferred to the others,
regard is to be had to the fact, that every point of maximum disturbance of the leyel
of the water, whether upwards or downwards, that is to say, eyery point of maximum
or minimum speed of gliding (se article 20), forms the origin of a wave, which spreads
out obliquely from the vessel (as may easily be observed in s8mooth water), and 80
transfers mechanical energy to distant particles of water, which energy is lost. Hence
such points should be as few as possible; and the changes of motion at them should be
as gradual as possible; and these conditions are fulfilled by the curves described in
article 17, by the name of © Lissoneoids,” being those which trayerse the point P in
the figures, and which may have any proportion of length to breadth, from 4/3 to
infinity.

(27.) Approximate Rules for Construction and Calculation —The description of those
curves, already given in article 17, has been' confined to those properties which are
