Steel, gold, tin, &c. showed nothing of the kind, but copiously reflected the invisible rays. A few years ago, as Dr. Ropixs0N was showing me some experiments with the
induction coil, it seemed worth while to try whether the spark obtained when a Leyden
Jar has its coatings connected with the secondary terminals might not be sufficiently
strong to exhibit by projection the long _ spectrum shown by electric light. On
projecting a spectrum formed by a prism and lens of quartz on a piece of uranium glass,
the long spectrum was in fact exhibited. Tt was not, indeed, 80 bright as when formed
by means of a powerful voltaic battery, but nevertheless was quite bright enough to
work by. It was discontinuous, consisting of bright lines.
