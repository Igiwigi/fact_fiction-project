‘© The field magnetic observations were made concurrently by Mr. Wauker. After
= the control magnetic data from Greenwich had been obtained from the Astronomer
<= Royal, and the other necessary data from the Ordnance Survey Office, the reduction
8 of the observations was completed and the disturbing forces calculated.
| A geological examination of each district was then made by Dr. Cox. Specimens
% of the typical rocks, and of any other rocks which by reason of their exceptional
‘characters appear likely to shed light on the problem, were sent to Prof. Ernest
5 Wirson, who determined their magnetic susceptibilities. By these means it was
‘S possible to ascertain the rocks which were in any way capable of exciting the magnetic
@ disturbances, and those which were certainly incapable of causing the disturbances.
2 The results so obtained were compared with information derived from a chemical and
=. petrological examination of the most susceptible rocks, and the geological structure
£ was then considered in its bearing on the known facts.

Tn the following pages, Mr. WatKkmr and Prof. Witson give separate accounts of
© their own parts in the investigation, and Dr. Cox has endeavoured, in Part III., with
3 the help of contributions from Mr. Water, to show how far the results may be
3 explained by the known geological structure. Contributions from Mr. WALKER or
¢ Prof. Wrison included in Part IIL. are indicated by quotation marks and initials.

6 Dr. Cox wishes to acknowledge his great indebtedness to Dr. StranAn, Director
of the Geological Survey, for much valuable advice as to the carrying out of the work,
and for his help in the preparation of this report. He has also to thank other
officers of the Geological Survey, more especially Dr. H. H. Toomas and Dr. Watcorr
Grason, for their assistance in obtaining specimens and for help on various points.
