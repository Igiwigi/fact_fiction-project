It thus follows that the earliest known Elasmobranchs are from the
Upper Devonian, the group appearing much later than the Osteichthyes. The early history of the Elasmobranchs though little known was clearly complex ;
an attempt to discuss it must be founded on the fin structure. Cladoselache is a fish
apart, characterized by the fact that all the fins, both median and paired, are supported
by a single series of parallel radials which extend outward very nearly to theiremargins
and leave unsupported only avery small expanse of fin web, strengthened by ceratotrichia
which have not been preserved. All the fins are attached to the body by a very long *
base, but some concentration of the base of the fin is shown by the occurrence of
certain radials which extend in only half-way to the base, and by a fusion of the more
posterior basal cartilages of the pectoral fin, each anterior basal supporting its own
radial. There are no fin spines.
