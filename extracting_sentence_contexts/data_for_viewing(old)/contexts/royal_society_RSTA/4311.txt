(b) The dynamics

Two sets of experimental studies are of critical importance to our understanding of the
dynamics of wave-turbulence interactions. The first set was a field study in Lake Ontario by

Kitaigorodskii & Lumley [19], Kitaigorodskii et al. [20] and Lumley & Terray [21]. The turbulence : =
was measured from the surface down to a 6m depth by a strain-sphere mounted on a tower : Sy
1.6km from the coast. Turbulence statistics are extracted from the velocity data using linear : 2
filtering. As the separation is incomplete, all turbulence spectra retain a prominent peak at the aed
energy-containing wave frequency. This general form led Lumley & Terray [21] to conclude that 22
turbulence velocity spectra in the ocean surface layer could be understood without recourse [4
to the dynamics. The kinematics, however, could not explain the more important fact that the : =
turbulent velocity spectra measured beneath the wind waves show a large enhancement about the : z
central wave frequency with an apparent increase in spectral density at high frequencies. This not [8

too subtle enhancement of the spectral density is the true consequence of dynamic interactions,
as in the wave-induced modulations discussed by Huang ef al. [22]. Limited by the separation
method employed here, their conclusions for the study, though of critical importance, could only
be regarded as questionable. The true physics of the dynamic turbulence and wave interactions
could be understood more quantitatively through the precisely controlled laboratory study by
Thais & Magnaudet [18].

Thais & Magnaudet [18] reported their controlled laboratory experiments conducted in the
large Air—Sea Interactions Facility of the ‘Institut de Mécanique Statistique de la Turbulence’
