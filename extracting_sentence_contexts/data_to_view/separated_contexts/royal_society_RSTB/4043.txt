The
genera of one species among them are the commonest, while Doona with 11 species
shows a rarity of 4Â°6, and Stemonoporus, with 15, one of 5:4. These facts cannot
be explained on any theory of adaptation. Table XX shows these facts summarised, and goes in the exact reverse direction
all through to what it should follow if the theory of natural selection could be
relied upon. The second conclusion drawn is that on the average the commonness of a species
depends upon its age from the time of its arrival in, or evolution in, the country. The commonness of any individual species will, of course, also depend upon its
degree of adaptation to local conditions, and upon many things which can only be
regarded as chance, such as the sudden appearance of new factors, like diseases, ete.,
in the problem.
