Taz aberrant forms and remarkable habits of the animals composing this order, 80
divergent from the general mammalian type, render the study of their myology a snb-
ject of the deepest anatomical interest ; and yet it is singular how little attention has
hitherto been directed to its investigation. 'Thus in the article © Cheiroptera” in the
« Cyclopzdia of Anatomy and Physiology,” the muscular system is passed over unnoticed ;
and in another standard work, Professor Owen's © Comparative Anatomy of Vertebrates,”
the only fact noticed regarding the muscles of the Bats is their deep red colour (vol. iii.
P-1). No extensive series of observations has hitherto been made on this subject; a
few species only have been dissected with care, and these dissections have not even been
compared with each other.
