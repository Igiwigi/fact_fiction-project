must always be borne in mind that this may be due, not to the ineffectiveness of the
endodermal influence itself, but to unfavourable conditions of healing which have
prevented its successful action.

It is not possible to be certain @ priori that all the endoderm has been removed
from a blastoderm ; small pieces of tissue may have been left attached to the epiblast.
It might be argued that this uncertainty is sufficient to cast doubt on the validity of the
method. But if the turning round of the endoderm has an effect on the direction of the
primitive streak in any particular case, then in that case at least, any such endodermal
fragments left attached to the epiblast have clearly not had an important influence.
On the other hand, if there is no apparent influence of the endoderm, it is possible that
this may be due to an inadequate separation of the two layers, but although this is
possible, reasons have been put forward in the last section for supposing that in fact the
removal of the endoderm is usually fairly complete.

The foregut appears always to be normally formed, unless the neural tube overlying
it is disarranged ; in such cases either the distorted neural tube has been unable to exert

its normal influence or some cause of distortion has arisen which has affected equally
both the ectodermal and endodermal structures of that region.

Protocols of the experiments are as follows, disregarding cultures lost by infection (Tables I and II).
