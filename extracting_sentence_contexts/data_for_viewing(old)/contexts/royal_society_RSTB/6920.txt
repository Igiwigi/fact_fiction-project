Weight of ovaries in grams
Fic. 32. Relation between weights of ovaries and of anal glands.


THE SPOTTED HYAENA, CROCUTA CROCUTA (ERXLEBEN) 51

The prepubertal group A shows the lowest values, but the other groups have a wide
range of variation, and show no correlation with the state of sexual activity. The
weight of the glands evidently depends to some extent upon body size and they appear
to have no special sexual significance. In view of the fact that the glands are present,
and developed to an equal extent, in both sexes, and are thus not secondary sexual
characters, this is rather to be expected.

Histology of the genitalia
The ovaries.

General remarks (fig. 55, Plate 6). The ovary is divided into three well-marked regions,
the cortex, the peripheral stroma, and the central fibrous stroma. The cortex is covered
externally by the germinal epithelium, consisting of a single layer of columnar cells.
Immediately internal to the germinal epithelium lies a layer of fibrous tissue 50-70
thick, the tunica albuginea. The fibres run approximately parallel to the surface of the
ovary, and are gathered into bundles which cross each other in different directions.
