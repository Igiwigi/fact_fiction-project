Later, in [65], a finer distributional approach was developed, which has recently been
extended to include quantitative aspects; see [66-69]. A good introduction to modern Tauberian
theory may be found in [70], while applications to operator semigroups are discussed thoroughly
in [1]. The following result is usually attributed to Ingham [71] and Karamata [72], although a version
was in fact first discovered by Riesz [73, Satz II]. It is a classical Tauberian theorem which
underpins just about all of what follows here; we refer to [53] for a short proof. Theorem 3.1.
