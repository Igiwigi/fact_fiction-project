Such great
differences in the toxicity of the venoms of different Colubrine and Sea-snakes,
the physiological action of which are identical (with the exception of the added
Viperine element in the case of Bungarus fasciatus, which probably accounts for
the much smaller proportion of the Colubrine element in its venom), are presumably
due to varying proportions of the active respiratory poisons in their compositions ; a
factor which must be taken into account in estimating the amount of antivenin
which is required to neutralise the effects of any given snake, together with the
amount of the poison ejected by it at a single bite. The markedly small virulence
of the poison of B. fasciatus as compared with that of the other Indian Colubrine
snakes is of great interest in connection with the presence of a Viperine element in
this venom, as I have shown in the first part of this paper ; for this element, although
less toxic than the Colubrine portion, nevertheless is of some bulk, as shown by the
marked coagulum produced by heating for a few moments to 90° C., which we have
seen above reduces considerably the effect of the Viperine element without affecting
the Colubrine portion. This fact no doubt accounts to some extent for the greater
minimal lethal dose of this poison. The experiments on the action of the serum on this poison were carried out with
rats, but owing to the small amount of venom in hand, only 8 mg. were used for each
rat, of approximately 60 grammes, which amounted to seven minimal lethal doses. The results are shown in the following table :—
