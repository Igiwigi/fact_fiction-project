For such purposes, then, we require a frequency of intermittent contacts
amounting to something like one hundred times per second,

The advantage of this intermittence may be understood from a concrete example. It is to be remembered that the writing-point, under the action of the responsive
fall, moves parallel to the surface of the recording plate. If now, by means of some
mechanism, the writing-point be made to vibrate to and fro, say ten times in a
second, at right angles to the plate, this will in no way affect the record, beyond
the fact that, instead of a continuous, a dotted line will be traced. The record will
not now labour under the defects inseparable from the friction of continuous contact. Instead of this we shall have the vibrating writer, tapping a record, which is
practically free from friction.
