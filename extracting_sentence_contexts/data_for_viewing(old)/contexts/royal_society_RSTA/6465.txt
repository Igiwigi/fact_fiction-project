(2) the role played by gauge symmetries in renormalization theory [128],

(3) the role played by gauge symmetries in the definition of the so-called topological
solutions—like instantons—associated with fibre bundles that are topologically non-
trivial,

(4) and the supposed ‘physical reality’ of the gauge potential in the Aharonov-Bohm effect
and similar escenarios [129-134].

This position could be traced back to Kretschmann’s objection against the supposed physical scope of the principle of
general covariance in general relativity [123].

'SBriefly, the gauge principle encodes the heuristic fact that the a global symmetry of a Lagrangian can be made local by
adding a gauge field, that is, a potential of a physical interaction.


In order to try to unravel the mysteries of gauge symmetries, different research avenues
have been explored. Rovelli, for instance, argues that gauge symmetries are a manifestation
of the relational nature of physical observables.'* In turn, Greaves and Wallace use Galileo’s
ship thought experiment [135] to argue that local symmetries can have empirical significance
or observable consequences [118] (see also [136-140]). Very briefly, the empirical significance of a
symmetry would result from the fact that a transformation acting on a subsystem of the universe
might have non-trivial observable effects associated with the relation between the subsystem
and the reference system provided by the corresponding environment.!> A different line of
argumentation clings to the fact that a symmetry transformation produces by definition states
