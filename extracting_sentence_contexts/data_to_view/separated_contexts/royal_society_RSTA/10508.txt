IN AQUEOUS SOLUTION, AND THE EXISTENCE OF COMPLEX IONS. 135

it does ; this would mean, either that the Ba ion has its velocity diminished more
than the anion in solution of the chloride but not in the nitrate, or, that the NO, ion
is diminished in velocity in the barium salt, but not in the potassium salt. Further,
the variation in p for potassium sulphate points to the fact that the potassium ion is
retarded more than the sulphate, but not more than the chloride. Any of these con-
clusions are of course possible, but improbable, and the more so since all the facts are
far more simply explained by the supposition that complex ions exist in certain salt
solutions. The variation in p with N, which is found by direct measurement in aqueous
solution, seems to point to the correctness of the assumption of a variation in wu and v. But for this class of salts it has been demonstrated for a few cases, and is probably
true for all, that a change in concentration of the solution occurs within the anion
boundary.
