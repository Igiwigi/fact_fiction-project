iety of mammals including rats [7], mice [8,9], rabbits [10],
horses [11] and piglets [12]. In effect, we rely on scientific
measures that signify pain in animals and make a judgement
based on the animalâ€™s responses to make our assessment.
Therefore, the modern definition of animal pain relies on a
number of testable principles when deciding if an animal
can be considered as capable of experiencing pain [2]. All ani-
mals are considered capable of nociception, which is the
detection of potentially injurious stimuli, and is usually
accompanied by a nocifensive withdrawal reflex away from
that stimulus. For pain, however, the animal must demon-
strate a change in future behavioural decisions and
motivational changes [2]. This relies on the fact that pain is
an adverse psychological experience resulting in learning,
memory formation and altered strategic decision making
during and after the event. If an animal has the neural appar-
atus to detect and experience painful stimuli, their behaviour
is altered and this indicates a change from their normal reper-
toire (e.g. suspension of feeding), which may be detrimental
to the animal and all responses are prevented by analgesic
drugs, then this evidence confirms pain occurs. Human
pain is often referred to when considering pain in animals,
but this is flawed thinking in many ways as the nociceptive
and pain system will be shaped quite differently in animals
which have had a different ecological and evolutionary his-
