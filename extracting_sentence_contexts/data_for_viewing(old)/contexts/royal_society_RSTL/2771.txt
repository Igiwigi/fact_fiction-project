pose the Liverpool tide to be produced at an interval of 484 hours preceding the
time at which it is observed, in order to make it agree nearly with the equilibrium-
theory; and we may suppose this time to be employed in the transmission of the
tide along its channel, If we suppose the original tide to lag behind the position
of equilibrium, we may suppose the amount by which it lags to vary with the
changes of the moon's force, to the amount above stated as the variation of X'. On
this supposition we may 8uppose the time of transmission of the tide along its chan-
nel to be constant. Or we may suppose that the changes of the moon's force not
only affect the lagging of the original tide behind the equilibrium position, but als
affect the velocity of transmission to Liverpool. In either of these ways the circum-
stances of the tide may be hypothetically represented ; but it will, of course, be un-
derstood that we use such hypotheses at present only for the sake of connecting and
representing the facts,

9. The effect which changes in the moon's force produce upon the retroposition of
the tide in time, that is, on the value of « in the formulze (a.) and (b.), is more difficult
to determine with any precision. It is, however, manifest from the general course of
the quantities in the Tables, that « is greater as the moon's parallax is greater, and as
her declination is greater. 'This is proved by each Table independently. Thus I have
collected as the amount of this change,

2-5 (p — 57") from the effect of parallax on the times (Art. 18.),
4” (p — 57') from the effect of parallax on the heights (Art. 20.),
75" in? 3 from the effect of declination on the times (Art. 23.) ;
