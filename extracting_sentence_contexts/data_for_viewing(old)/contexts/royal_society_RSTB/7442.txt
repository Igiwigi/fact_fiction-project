the following means of measurements of random samples of 200 puparia taken from stock
rearings of each of the three species:

length breadth ratio

species (mm.) (mm.) length/breadth
L. sericata 8-225 3-806 2-17
C. chloropyga 9,319 4-165 2-24
C. albiceps 8-659 4-182 2-08

It is evident that C. albiceps requires the greatest amount of food—more than four times
as much as either of the other two species—in order to maintain its maximum puparial size.
It does so, in fact, only under conditions where each larva has access to approximately 1-4 g.
of meat. The greatest response to an increase in the food supply takes place when the latter
is below the level at which 0-2 g. of meat is allowed per larva. Above this point, increasing
the food supply results in a comparatively slow response in the form of length increment.

Lucilia and C. chloropyga both react to improved conditions much more quickly through-
out the range, the former showing an increase in length which occurs more rapidly than in
the latter. Both species require approximately the same amount of food per larva in order
to produce puparia of maximum size, although the actual sizes differ considerably. This
optimum food level is found where concentrations of up to 500 larvae per 140 g. of meat
occur.

Thus, if individuals of the largest possible size are taken to indicate optimum conditions
