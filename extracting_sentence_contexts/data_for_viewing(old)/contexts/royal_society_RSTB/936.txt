It is evident from the foregoing account that the secretory process in the skin of
the Eel presents several points of peculiarity and interest. The demonstration ofa
secretion of threads from the club cells points to a similarity of function of these cells
in such otherwise widely separate Fish as the Eel and Mymine. The process ig
certainly better developed in the latter animal, and it has, moreover, the advantage
of special epidermie involutions devoted to manufacture and store of threads ; yet in
both, the whole club cell is cast off and mainly in the form of threads. :

The fact that Petromyzon produces a thread secretion was to be expected, but had
not been before clearly demonstrated, though the extrusion of the club cells was known,

What relation, if any, these thread-producing epidermic cells in Fish have to those
of larval Amphibia described by Leypre (10) and Exrrrs (11), it is not my place to
speculate upon. As regards the function of these threads in the slime of the Eel, I
have already stated my opinion that they are of value in causing the slime to adhere
to objects with which it is brought in contact. In Myzxine, however, I cannot but
think that the cloud of thread-penetrated slime that the animal is capable of
discharging, must be of service in aiding it to attack the far more powerful Fish that
often become its host.
