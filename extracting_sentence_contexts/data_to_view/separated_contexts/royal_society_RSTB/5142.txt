2.—Stomatal frequency in relation to the position of the leaf upon the plant. Yarp, in his study of Ulmaria palustris (‘ Ann. Bot.,’ vol. XXVI, p. 826, 1912), drew
attention to the fact that there appeared to be a regular increase in the number of stomata
per unit area as one passed from, the basal to the apical leaves, and raised the question
as to whether the phenomenon might not be a general one. Inasmuch as the leaves
of most plants tend to become smaller as one passes from the base to the apex, it is

apparent that the phenomenon may be but an expression of the negative correlation
dealt with in the preceding section, but, before considering this aspect, we may enquire
as to whether this gradient of stomatal frequency is a general one or not. Woodland grasses offer a suitable field of enquiry owing to the ease with which leaves
of comparable width and length can be obtained from varying heights on the same
plant.
