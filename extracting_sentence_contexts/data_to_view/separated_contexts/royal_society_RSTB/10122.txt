Most notably, music possesses important constraints
that allow better experimental control such as the fact that
performers move in a complex but yet formalized manner,
following musical conventions and, in most cases, a musical
score. With respect to other experimental scenarios, such con-
straints are an ecological way to both reduce the number of
experimental variables and overcome technical issues. For
example, the fact that performers strictly follow a musical
score allows for comparisons between different ensembles,
something that would be more difficult in analysing, for
instance, teamwork at a meeting, where discussion and
work in different teams may follow significantly different
paths. Moreover, music enables offer opportunities for ana-
lysing subtle aspects of non-verbal communication. For
example, music often explicitly aims to convey emotion to
an audience, which is not usually the case in, say, computer
gaming.
