It is seen that the actual amounts of nitrogen involved were large, being about
20 grams in the experiments in the wider vessels, and nearly half as much in those in
the narrower vessels. The losses were in some cases about, or more than, a gram ;
and one of the two gains amounted to more than 3 grams.

In each of the three experiments without a plant (Nos. 1, 2, and 3), there was a
loss of nitrogen. FRANK states that it was not as nitric acid, which either diminished
but little, or increased, there being no plant to take it up. Nor was it as ammonia,
as a direct experiment with a rich peaty soil, enclosed under a luted bell jar, and
ammonia free air passed through it, showed very little ammonia evolved. He points
out that the more imperfect the ventilation of the soil, the less was the gain; and he
considers it probable that in the absence of ventilation the evolution of free nitrogen
would be enhanced. In fact the losses were greater in experiments 2 and 3 with
vessels 80 cm. (= 31째5 in.) deep, and only 11 cm, (= 4째3 in.) wide, than in No. 1
with a width of 17째5 em. (= 6째9 in.).

It is indeed obvious that, with vessels so narrow and deep, and closed at the
bottom, as according to the description we conclude they were,* and with no plant to
cause evaporation, and with consequently very little atration, the conditions would be
favourable for the evolution of free nitrogen, and the more so in the narrower vessels.

In fact it may be doubted whether, if there had been holes at the bottom of the

* We have since ascertained that the vessels were closed at the bottom.
