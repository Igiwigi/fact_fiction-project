area © 7 z, but also to prevent their further origination from the point o—the entire
umbrella thus becoming paralyzed. Hence, before the removal of the lithoeyst, the
contractile waves which originated ab the point 0, no less than those which originated
at, the lithocyst itself, must in some way or other have been due to the ganglionic
influence emanating from the lithocyst and asserting itself at the distant point 0.

This property which lithocysts sometimes present of asserting their ganglonic influ-
ence at a distance from their own locality, can only, I think, be explained by supposing
that at the point where, under these circumstances, the contractions originate, there
are situated some scattered ganglionic cells of considerahle functional power, but yet
not of power enough to originate contractile waves unless re-enforced by some
stimulating influence which reaches them from the lithoeysb through the neryous
plexus. But whether or not this is the true interpretation of the facts, I think it is
evident that these facts are of considerable importance in relation to the theory of
ganglionic action which has already been s0 fully discussed in the first division of the
present paper. For, turning again to the woodeut (fig. 11), if the discharges of the
lithocyst are regulated only by resistance, it seems almost unaccountable that these
discharges should frequently fail to excite the contiguous area a@ @ @ z, while they
are effectual in exciting the remote area 2 2 2 2; and this even after 2 2 2 2 has been
almost completely severed from x > © & by the severity of the incisions. To my
mind, the facts seem rather to point to the conclusion that the lithoeysb is engaged in
emitting some sorb of continuous ganglionic impulse which spreads throughout the
nervous plexus, and helps to stimulate the ganglionic cells which are scattered
throughout this plexus. And this conclusion is not incompatible with the view that
the resistance which is offered by the plexus is 80 adjusted to the accumulation of
