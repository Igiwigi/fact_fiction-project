Their effect implies that auto-catalysis,
due to peroxide formation, of the reactions concerned in knock occurs.


‘KNOCK’ IN THE SPARK-IGNITION ENGINE 483

Of the various products known to be formed in the ‘end-gas’ of an engine, formaldehyde
is the only one which, in small quantities, has an appreciable anti-knock action. Olefins
and inert gases are known to have anti-knock effects, but only when added in comparatively
large quantities. The effect of formaldehyde means that a considerable selfinhibition of
the reactions leading to knock occurs and, together with the facts concerning organic
peroxides, shows that the two products whose actions particularly yield keys to an under-
standing of knock reactions are formaldehyde and organic peroxides. It is for this reason
that the sampling investigation has been largely concentrated on their estimation.
