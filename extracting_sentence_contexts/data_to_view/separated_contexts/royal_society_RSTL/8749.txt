I have seen also a paper on the vegetable parasites in shells
* July 12, 1876.—T have since shown that the whole of the Stylasteridee aro true Hydroids. STRUCTURE AND RELATIONS OF CERTAIN CORALS. UT

in the © Proceedings” of one of the learned societies of Vienna—T think in the * Sitzungs-
berichte.”

A remarkable fact is that the parasites are distinetly green, though they appear to
be fungi, and those of shells are described as fungi. Possibly the parasites in question
have already been described by Professor K6LLIKER. I have, of course, not access to
his paper®,
