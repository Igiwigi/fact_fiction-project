rightly points out “that such a metamorphosis of one form of leaf to another
occur,” and cites his own experiments, by which leaves, normally developing
seale-leaves, were transformed in the course of their individual growth into fo
leaves.t He further cites those interesting cases of the appearance of sporang'
leaves of Botrychium, which are normally green expanded foliage leaves, m
that, where the sporangia occur, the vegetative development is reduced ;
observations on Osmunda and Blechnum are also quoted, and from these the cot
sion was drawn that “the sporophylls are metamorphosed foliage leaves”; a
more explicitly it is stated for plants at large (Joe. cit., p. 118), “ that the plant fe
in the first instance leaves of only one type, the foliage leaves, though their
is often modified by influences which appear in the course of development.”
facts do not necessarily bear out the interpretation thus put upon them: what:
shown by such cases as that of Botrychium, or Blechnum, or Osmunda, is simply
