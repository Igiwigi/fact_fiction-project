variation in the surface tension need not be due solely to variation in the quantity
temâ€™. The non-electrical surface energy, represented by yo, may vary with the
potential difference. A variation in the potential difference at the surface of
separation between the mereury and the solution may be accompanied not only by a
variation in the electrostatic surface energy, but also by a variation in the distribution
of the matter in the neighbourhood of the surface.

Tf a variation of the kind just mentioned can be traced, it is clear that we cannot
consider the phenomena as if they were due to a certain non-electrical distribution
upon which is superposed an electrostatic double-layer, producing no other effect than
that represented by its electrical energy. Hence it need not happen that the
maximum surface tension corresponds to zero potential difference, for the maximum
surface tension may arise from the fact that non-electrical effects, accompanying the
change in the potential difference and tending to reduce the surface tension, pass
through a minimum value as the potential difference changes. This minimum value
need not necessarily correspond to zero potential difference. The possible nature of
non-electrical effects which may accompany changes in the potential difference is
discussed later. The first part of the paper contains an experimental analysis of the
Lippmann-Helmholtz theory.

Tn the Lippmann-Helmholtz theory of the capillary electrometer there are in reality
two distinct hypotheses, either of which may be separately justifiable. The first
concerns the manner in which the potential difference at the capillary varies with the
