The two portions are of different types, the convergency of the first being determined
by r/c, in relation to the charge E, and of the second by r/a, in relation to the disc.
The first portion is in fact —V, where V is the potential due to the charge E.

In the process by which we deduced the analytical continuation. of the function on
the axis, we assumed ¢ and therefore z to be positive.

Thus, on the positive side of the disc, with r < a, the total potential is given by
