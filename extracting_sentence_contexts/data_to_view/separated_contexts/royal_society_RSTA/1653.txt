The overall duration estimates for tests and tasks, based on the experience with previous
laboratory and even field tests, were significantly underestimated. Figure 2. (a—c) ROBEX experiments at a Moon analogue site on Mt Etna: autonomous deployment of an array of seismic sensors 16

— Factors contributing to these findings are the unstructured terrain and environmental ia
factors of the remote site where especially the access time of the personnel on site has :=
dominant time influences. These factors are also considered as the main reason for Da
conducting an analogous campaign to identify exploration-like factors in the mission :3
concept. 1 P

— Other factors were not of lunar analogue origin and range from unfavourable weather 8
(sunny and calm scenes obscure the fact that Etna is a high alpine region with rapidly : oe
changing visibility and wind conditions); furthermore, access of tourists disturbed the ar)
test runs (the test site is a World Heritage Site and exclusive access to the test teams was 1
not granted by the authorities). :¢

Most of the total delays were a mixture of both groups, and some were indirectly caused by
them (e.g. empty batteries after unplanned dwell times), making it difficult or almost impossible
to break them down into relevant and irrelevant delays. Although cumbersome, a better event
and ‘side factor’ tracking could be worthwhile. When planning the field test campaign, a large
schedule for contingencies should be provided.
