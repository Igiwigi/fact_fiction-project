MONOCLINIC DOUBLE SELENATES OF THE IRON GROUP. 405

The extreme readings, for red Li and greenish blue F light, were repeated and con-
firmed several times, and the fact definitely established that the optic axis emerging
to the left of the normal to the plate was dispersed 7’ (within the error of experiment,
which even with the beautifully small innermost rings and very sharp hyperbolic
vertices obtained amounts to possibly 2’), while the right-hand optic axis was dispersed
double this amount, 15’. That the extreme outside reading in each case (the highest
on the left and the lowest on the right) was for red was clearly apparent, and was
confirmed by the colours bordering the vertices when seen in white light, the inner
margins of both being tinted red, and the left one more faintly than the right. Hence, it can be accepted with confidence that the second median line was dispersed
15’—7’

to the extent of , that is 4’.
