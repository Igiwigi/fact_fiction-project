expected value of a (hidden) cause or expectation. These causes
are referred to as hidden because they have to be inferred from
their sensory consequences.

In summary, predictive coding represents a biologically
plausible scheme for updating beliefs (or expectations) about
the world using sensory samples (figure 2). In this setting,
neuroanatomy and neurophysiology can be regarded as a bio-
logical embodiment of how sensory signals are generated; for
example, a smiling face generates luminance surfaces that gen-
erate textures and edges and so on, down to retinal input. This
form of hierarchical inference explains a remarkable number of
anatomical and physiological facts as documented elsewhere
[15,17,18]. In brief, it explains the hierarchical nature of cortical
cartography; the prevalence of backward connections and

Recent advances in theoretical neuroscience have inspired a
paradigm shift in cognitive neuroscience (figure 1). This shift
is away from the brain as a passive filter of sensations towards
a view of the brain as a statistical organ that generates hypo-
theses or fantasies which are tested against sensory evidence
[6]. In this formulation, the brain is, literally, a fantastic organ
(fantastic: from Greek phantastikos, the ability to create mental
images, from phantazesthai). This perspective can be traced
back to Helmholtz and the notion of unconscious inference
