Yet AMPs do not act only as
immune effectors; therefore, AMPs are presumably under
concurrent, pleiotropic selection for being able to fulfil their
different roles. In vertebrates [11] and to a lesser extent in
crustaceans [17], AMPs are also immune-modulators and
have anti-inflammatory properties or contribute to wound heal-
ing. Thus, while research on AMPs has mostly focused on their
antimicrobial properties in the context of pathogens (a fact that
might partly be ascribed to the history of their discovery [4]), in
many multicellular organisms, AMPs have other functions. They can be important mediators of interactions with commen-
sal or mutualistic bacteria, on both an ecological as well as
evolutionary scale. This aspect has not been sufficiently studied,
but informative work has been done in the tsetse fly, Glossina
[84], mosquitoes [85] or in Rhodnius, the vector of Chagas
disease [86].
