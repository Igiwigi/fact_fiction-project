'Bby one side, while the hami are both projected upward into the mass of sarcode. In
Z80me species of sponge one or the other of these forms more especially prevails, but in
others, as in Halichondria incrustans, JOHNnsTroN, the simple, reversed, and contort forms
Zare indiscriminately mixed in the tissues, and they occur in eyery imaginable form of
attachment in great profusion, and accompanied by the anchorate forms as well.

E The type of this form of spiculum, the simple bihamate, is not peculiar to the Spon-

Egiade; it occurs in a much more highly organized class, in a radiate animal, Fehinus
Sophera, Forsrs, *© British Starfishes, where we find an abundance of these organs disposed
Son the external surface of the tubular suckers of the animal, but they are composed
Zof carbonate of lime instead of silex. IT am indebted to my friend Mr. Jouxn Howarv
ASrmwarr for my knowledge of this interesting fact.

Sometimes the simple forms of bihamate spicula have the middle of the shaft umbo-
nate, and this occurrence is -subject to three varieties :—

ExTer-vmpoxaTe.— When the umbo is on the middle of the outer curve of the shatt
(Plate XXTV. fig. 44).

IvTer-UMBONATE—When the umbo is on the middle of the inner curve of the shatt
(Plate XXIV. fig. 45).

Bi-vrBoxaTe.—When the middle of both the inner and outer curve of the shaft have
an umbo (Plate XXIV. fig. 46).
