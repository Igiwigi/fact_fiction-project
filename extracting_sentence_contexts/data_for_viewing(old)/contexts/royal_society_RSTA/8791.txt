MR. G, I. TAYLOR ON TIDAL FRICTION IN THE TRISH SEA. 3

In places where the bottom is uneven or weedy, Bazin gives 1°7 as the value of y.
Under these circumstances

It will be seen that large changes in the amount of roughness produce only small
changes in the amount of friction on the bottom. On looking at Bazin’s formula
it will be seen that this is due to the fact that the sea is deep. In order that the
roughness of the bottom may. have a large effect in slowing down a stream, it is
necessary that 7 should be small. It seems, in fact, that the size of the projections
which constitute the roughness or inequality of the bed must be some definite fraction
of v in order that their effect may be felt on the stream as a whole. In other words,
the direct effect of the projections extends to a distance which is some multiple of
the linear dimension of the projections ; and if these are small enough compared with
the depth, very little difference is made to the total flow of the stream by changing
the amount of roughness on-the bottom.

This conclusion is important in the present application, because it means that by
adopting the values of K given above we shall be able to get a fairly accurate
estimate of the friction of the sea on the bottom without knowing the exact nature
of the bottom. We may under-estimate the friction, but we are certainly not likely
to over-estimate it; for our estimate will not take account of unevennesses, such as
