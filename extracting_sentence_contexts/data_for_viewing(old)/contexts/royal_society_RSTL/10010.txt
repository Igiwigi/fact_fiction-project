Since, therefore, the compression by means of the clamp in the suleus does not
produce its effects upon the ventricle by lowering its excitability, or by altering the
rate of the impulses from the motor ganglia, it is most probable that it does act by
weakening the strength of the impulses in the same way as suggested by v. Bascn,
in order to explain the half-rhythm caused by the use of sufticiently weak electrical
stimuli.

Further, the similarity between the effects of tightening the clamp and of heating
> the sinus and auricles alone, is sufficiently great to suggest that in both cases the
effects are produced in the same way, and therefore the main reason why heating the
sinus and auricles caused the observed alteration in the rhythm of the ventricle is to

2 be found in the fact that, when the motor ganglia are heated, not only is the rate of

discharge of the impulses quickened, but also the quicker impulses are of necessity

3 weaker than before.

To s8wm up the conclusions arrived at 80 far, we have the following propositions :â€”
1. The rhythm of the heart is caused by discrete motor impulses passing to the
: muscular tissue from certain motor ganglia.

2. Each one of these impulses produces a contraction of the ventricle only when a due
relation exists between the strength of the impulses and the excitability of the
ventricular muscle,
