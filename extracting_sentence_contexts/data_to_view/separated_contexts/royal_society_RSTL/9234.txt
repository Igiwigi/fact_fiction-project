I agsumed conjecturally four values of 5 lying between #=15* 22' and 7=14®, which
I knew hs be very nearly the final value of 7; and then computed four equidistanb
values of — = logyy tan

The values were
-19381, £16230, 11882, =—-00684. The fact that the last value is negative shows that the integration is carried a little
beyond the point when 4 cos 7=29, but this is unimportant. AND ON THE REMOTE HISTORY OF THE KARTH. 505

Combining these values by the rules of the calculus of finite differences, T find
23=13" 59%

This final value of & (viz.:
