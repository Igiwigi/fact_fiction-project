should occur, in the direction of reducing the darkening towards u = 0-6.

The conclusion is that the darkening on the solar disc shows no evidence of the
existence of a purely scattering atmosphere above the radiating material.

Note.—It is difficult to make direct estimates of the coefficients of scattering in the
solar atmosphere, but as far as the numerical results go they confirm the negligible
importance of scattering (see e.g. LINDBLAD, loc. cit., p. 21) ; the densities are too small.}
But this is not to deny the probability of scattering playing an important part in other
stars. Indeed, there is considerable evidence to the contrary. The star y Cassiopeize{
has a spectrum of type B Op, with the Balmer lines Ha to H¢ bright (and, except
Ha, centrally reversed), and with a number of bright metallic lines, thus a spectrum
with distinctly chromospheric features. The suggestion is that the star is in fact
provided with a very extensive chromosphere. Scuuster§ showed that when there
is a continuous background bright lines can only be produced if there is sufficient
scattering to dim the background, combined with a low temperature gradient, otherwise
the lines should be absorption lines. The inference is that y Cassiopeise possesses an
extensive hydrogen atmosphere in which the general absorption is small compared
with the scattering and the selective emission. Now the temperature of this star has
been determined by two different observers using different experimental methods.
H. H. Praskert,|| using the neutral wedge method, determined the temperature from
the position of maximum as 6800°, and drew attention to the lowness of this compared
with the accepted mean for B-type stars. But the Potsdam observers] had just
previously also determined the apparent temperature, from the form of the energy
curve, and found the same value 6800° ; the mean temperature of the B stars in the same
