In the tails, though, the axisymmetric
instanton clearly underestimates the probability, while the symmetry-broken instanton is in good
agreement. This is particularly clear in the right tail of the right-most panel of figure 4, where
the axisymmetric instanton depicted by the red line is far too steep to agree anywhere with the
observed tail scaling. This trend continues in fully developed turbulence at higher Re: the analysis
of larger DNS, e.g. in [4], shows that the strain PDF tails can in fact be described by stretched
exponentials « exp{—c+ |a|°+} with exponents #4 < 1, whereas we find that the exponents in both
tails derived from the vortex-ring instanton increase monotonically with |a| and saturate above
04 =2.5 in the right tail and above #_ =2 in the left tail. By contrast, while the Sj(a)-curve that
we obtained for the symmetry-broken instantons is still convex in the observable range that we
were able to consider at the given resolution, the exponents + are monotonically decreasing in
|a| for this branch and decay below 1.5 for both positive and negative strain. For the vorticity observable of the same DNS dataset at ¢ € {1,250, 1000}, we observe the same
qualitative results (not shown): at the lowest Re, the instanton again perfectly describes the PDF,
whereas the range of validity of the estimate transitions into the tails at higher Re.
