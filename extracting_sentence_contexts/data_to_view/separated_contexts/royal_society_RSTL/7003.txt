There were extravasations along all the great veins, into the cellular
tissue of the pancreas, throughout the diaphragm, beneath the peritoneum, and all over
the abdomen. The interior of the latter, indeed, looked exactly as if it had been

cellular tisxue, In fact, had the history of the case not been known, it would have
been supposed that the animal had laboured under a severe form of purpura hemor-
rhagica. In the neighbourhood of the wounds there was great swelling, as well as an extrava-
sation of brownish putrid looking blood. Everything pointed to blood poisoning.
