The ecliptic conjunc-
tion took place at 8 10' 2g” in the morning, mean time at
Greenwich, or 8* g' 6” apparent time : and the elements were
as follow :

True longitude of the luminaries 4* 16* 4a g2”

Sun's declination, north - 16 2 g8
semi-diameter - - 15 57
Moon's semi-diameter - = 16 29
equatorial parallax - 61 ©

horary motion from the sun 35 9

true latitude - = 14, 42

horary motion in latitude - g 28

From these elements I have found, by a trigonometrical
calculation, that the sun rose centrally eclipsed to the inhabi-
tants of the western coast of Africa, in N. lat. 24* 57' and W,
long. 14* 9. The centre of the moon's shadow then, crossing
the desert, proceeded towards the Mediterranean, near to, but
rather to the southward of, Tripoli; and crossed the parallel
of N. lat. gg* in E. long. 20* 44. But in no part of its course
did it advance more northerly than N. lat. 9g* 55' g6”, which
I find by a trigonometrical calculation to be its maximum of
latitude, and the parallel of which it reached in E. long. g5*
21' 8”, It then turned to the south; and the sun became
centrally eclipsed on the meridian in N, lat, goZ* and E. long.

59* 45".

Let us now compare this. result, with the fact as related by
D1oporvs. lt is stated by this author, that AGaTHocLEs was
8ix days on his passage, from Syracuse to the coast of Africa ;
although he used the utmost expedition, being, in fact, closely
pursued by the Carthaginian fleet. The place where he landed
was called Azrepizs, the Quarries; whence he proceeded to
the neighbouring cities of Meyaay Tia, Megalapolis, or the
Great City, and Aevzo» Tore, White Tunis. The position of
these cities is not handed down to us; all that we know is,
that the latter place ( which must not be confounded with the
present Tunis) was two thousand stadia, or two hundred and
twenty-nine English miles, distant from Carthage.
