The
explanation is obvious when we realise that the pattern seen in the microscope is
due to the differences of level and texture in the surface of the specimen which have
been produced by the action of the acid used in etching. This pattern, although
in its origin dependent upon the actual crystalline structure of the metal at the
time when the surface was etched, remains as a mere mask, beneath which re-orienta-
tion of crystalline elements may go on without affecting its appearance. The etched
pattern is in this respect in the same position as a scratch or mechanical marking of
the surface, and the persistence of the etched pattern after annealing is simply an
extension into more minute detail of the well-known fact that the external shape
of a piece of metal is not in general affected by annealing, although the crystalline
structure is entirely changed. These considerations show that we cannot expect to see the process of re-crystallisa-
tion in any metal where etching, staining, or relief polishing is needed to differentiate

the constituents. We therefore abandoned the attempt to observe this process in
iron, but our attention was directed to the study of similar processes of annealing
or re-crystallisation as seen in more fusible metals, particularly lead.
