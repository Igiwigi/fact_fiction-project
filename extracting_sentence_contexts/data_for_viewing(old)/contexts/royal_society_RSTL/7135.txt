PART I.—INTRODUCTORY.

(1) Tur most obvious mechanical phenomenon in electrical and magnetical experiments

Is the mutual action by which bodies in certain states set each other in motion while
Still at a sensible distance from each other. The first step, therefore, in reducing these
Shenomena into scientific form, is to ascertain the magnitude and direction of the force
Seting between the bodies, and when it is found that this force depends in a certain
Tay upon the relative position of the bodies and on their electric or magnetic condition,
EE seems at first sight natural to explain the facts by assuming the existence of some-
Hiing either at rest or in motion in each body, constituting its electric or magnetic state,
-Znd capable of acting at a distance according to mathematical laws.

:5 In this way mathematical theories of statical electricity, of magnetism, of the mecha-
jcal action between conductors carrying currents, and of the induction of currents have
Seen formed. In these theories the force acting between the two bodies is treated with

Foference only to the condition of the bodies and their relative position, and without

Spy express consideration of the surrounding medium.

EZ These theories assume, more or less explicitly, the existence of substances the parti-
