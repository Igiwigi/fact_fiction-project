enables it to communicate double refraction to a distant part

of a plate of glass, where the heat does not reside in a sensible

state ;—the existence of a moveable polarity in glass, whe-

ther the doubly refracting structure is communicated trans-

iently or permanently ;—and the appearance of regular cleay-

ages varying with the direction of the axes of double refrac-

tion, are facts which render it more than probable that a

peculiar fluid is the principal agent in producing all the phe»

nomena of crystallization and double refraction. " |
There is one fact, however, which forms a fine connection

between the aberration of the extraordinary ray and the prin- ;

ciples established in this Paper. It has been demonstrated by |

an eminent English, philosopher,* that every undulation must
