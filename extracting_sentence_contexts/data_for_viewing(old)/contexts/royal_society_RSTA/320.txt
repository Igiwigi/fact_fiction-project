(d) The quantum hardware description language workflow

The circuit design workflow relies heavily on symbolic computer algebra
methods. Using symbolic algebra, rather than working with numerical matrix
representations of all the operators appearing in the component parameter
triplets, makes it possible to view the overall circuit (S,L,H) in an analytic
form. It also allows the designer to defer choosing the values of numerical
parameters, which could be convenient for optimization scenarios, as well as
details such as the upper photon-number limits to use for truncated Fock spaces
in numerical simulations.

In fact, we can define our own algebraic types, operations and simplification
rules not just for Hilbert space operators and scalar coefficients, but also for
circuit algebra components. This approach enables us to extend the hierarchical

clear in the following outline of the modelling workflow.
