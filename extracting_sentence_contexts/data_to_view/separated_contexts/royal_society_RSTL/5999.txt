AGass1z, and reproduced by subsequent writers, without due regard to the difficulties
asociated with it. That the pressures of a glacier are 80 parcelled out as to 8queeze
contiguous fragments of ice, not exceeding a cubic inch in size, in all possible directions,
is 80 improbable, that reflection alone must throw great difficulties in the way of its
acceptance. It is with some diffidence that IT here venture to express an opinion upon a question
that I have not specially examined ; but it appears to me probable that the decomposi-
tion of glacier ice into large granules, regarding which s0 much has been written, may
be connected with the foregoing facts. The ice of glaciers is sometimes disintegrated

Ato a great depth ; causing it to resemble an aggregate of jointed polyhedra more than a
Neoherent solid. I was very near losing my life in 1857 on the Col du Geant by trusting
Zto 8uch ice; and last summer I found vast masses of it at the end of the Allalein
Zglacier.
