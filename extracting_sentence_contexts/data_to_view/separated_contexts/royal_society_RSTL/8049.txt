From the values given (art. 317), we get cos =gt IE ; and since —a=F', we

have cos +4/F'=(b+c): 24/ —ade, with similar values for cos 9 -y/F, cos 6! SF Hence we may write the equation of the conic $, which is the envelope of a line cut
harmonically by S, 8S' (see SALMON's © Conics,” p. 334), in the following manner ;—

This equation is altogether Wont having no reference to any particular system of
axes, being in fact true for any system whatever of trilinear axes. Cor. 1. In like manner the equation of SaLMox's conic F, which is the locus of points
whence tangents to S, S' form an harmonic pencil, may be written in the form

x+F cos 0a*+x/F cos 0+ F" co88"2P. . . . . . .
