We also find that, in addition to Lanchester’s first approximation, other first approxi-
mation paths can be obtained and various new paths are dealt with briefly, e.g. the
“extended” phugoids, which are more correct than Lanchester’s phugoids. The method
can also be applied to “ three-dimensional” phugoids which give the Immelmann turn ;
the slow spin of the stalled aeroplane; the slow roll; etc. In fact, first approximations
to the most important aerobatics have already been obtained by the method of this
paper. Some have been worked out in detail already ; others are now being investigated
by the writer and collaborators. Further, a method has been devised for the systematic
study of the equations of motion for the deduction of possible first approximations in
an a priort manner.
