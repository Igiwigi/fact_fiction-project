Ix the months of April and May 1871 I obtained a supply of the freshwater bivalve
Pisidium pusillum, from a muddy little stream near Jena, in Saxe Weimar. ' The fact that the development of the eggs. of this mollusk takes place within a pair
of brood-cavities formed at the root of the inner gill-lamella on each side, enables the
observer very readily to obtain embryos in different stages of development. Lzyvi6 and O. Scnxpr had previously to this described the development of species
of Cyclas, which genus really embraces Pisidium.
