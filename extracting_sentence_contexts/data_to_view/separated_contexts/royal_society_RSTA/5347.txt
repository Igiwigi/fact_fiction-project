Higher up, however, it dwindles;
and above a certain point, a high IQ is of little advantage. An earlier researcher, quoted by Hudson [2, p. 128], puts it in another way:

High but not the highest intelligence, combined with the greatest degree of persistence,
will achieve greater eminence than the highest degree of intelligence with somewhat less
persistence. Well, after these various remarks about the makings of a good researcher, my recommendation to
you is ‘give it a try!’

(b) A good memory may help

I have myself witnessed the simple fact that a good memory might help a lot! During a holiday
tour of the USA with my family (wife Margaret, and children Richard and Helen) in 1980, we
visited John Hutchinson, a researcher in shell buckling, at his home near Harvard. In the evening,
we played a game of Pelmanism (also called concentration or pairs).
