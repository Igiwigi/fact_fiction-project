This theme issue pursues an exploration of the potential of taking into account the environmental
sensitivity of development to explaining the evolution of metazoan life cycles, with special focus on
complex life cycles and the role of developmental plasticity. The evolution of switches between
alternative phenotypes as a response to different environmental cues and the evolution of the control
of the temporal expression of alternative phenotypes within an organism’s life cycle are here treated
together as different dimensions of the complex relationships between genotype and phenotype, fos-
tering the emergence of a more general and comprehensive picture of phenotypic evolution through
a quite diverse sample of case studies. This introductory article reviews fundamental facts and con-
cepts about phenotypic plasticity, adopting the most authoritative terminology in use in the current
literature. The main topics are types and components of phenotypic variation, the evolution of organ-
ismal traits through plasticity, the origin and evolution of phenotypic plasticity and its adaptive
value. Keywords: life cycle; genetic accommodation; metazoans; polyphenism; reaction norm

In the context of the modern synthesis, the role of Phenotypic evolution depends on phenotypic vari-
environment in organic evolution can be roughly sum- ation, and in metazoans, as in other multicellular
marized by the well-known phrase: ‘environment organisms, phenotypic variation (when not explicitly
proposes, natural selection disposes’, which expresses restricted to a given developmental stage) is variation
the one-way relationship between environment and in developmental trajectories throughout the ontogeny
adaptation in orienting the direction of evolutionary (Fusco 2001).
