protected from the floating matter of the air, proyes that they do not contain germs
capable of generating life. Dr. BasT1ax, indeed, affirms that a temperature of 140
Fan. reduces, in all cases, 8uch germs to a state of actual or potential death. But
even in flasks which have been raised to a temperature of 212®, and hermetically
sealed, putrefaction, and its as8ociated Bacterial life, do, he alleges, most certainly
arise ; from which he infers that Bacteria are spontaneously generated. © We know,”
he 8ays, © that boiled turnip- or hay-infusions, exposed to ordinary air, exposed to fil-
tered air, to calcined air, or shut off altogether from contact with air, are more or
less prone to swarm with Bacteria and Vibriones in the course of from two to six
days” *.

We are here met by a difficulty at the outset. Dr. BasTIAN's proof of Bacterial death
at 140? Fans. consists solely in the observed fact, that when a certain liquid is heated to
that temperature no life appears in it afterwards. In another liquid, however, he finds
that life appears two days after it has been heated to 212%, Instead of concluding logi-
cally that in the one liquid life is destroyed and in the other not, he chooses to asxume
arbitrarily that 140* Fans. is the death-temperature for both ; and this being s0, the life
observed in the second liquid figures, in his inference, as a case of spontaneous generation.
A great deal of Dr. BasT1aN's most cogent reasoning rests upon this extraordinary founda-
tion. As8umptions of this kind guide him in his most serious experiments. He finds, for
example, that a mineral s0lution does not develop Bacteria when exposed to the air; and
he concludes from this that an organic infusion als» may be thus exposed without
danger of infection. He exposes turnip-uice accordingly, obtains a crop of Bacteria,
which, in the light of his assumption, are spontaneously generated. Such are the warp
and woof of some of the weightiest arguments on this question which have been
