tozoa which had penetrated into every part of their envelopes was very considerable.
Very many of these had arrived at, and were sticking by their larger end into the
vitellary membrane, from which they projected like spines from the head of a thistle ;
while there were many others which had not arrived at this part, their power of
penetration being exhausted, ana their progress inwards being arrested before they
had passed more than half-way through the outer gelatinous coverings. Others,
again, had penetrated to scarcely more than their own length into them, while a till
greater number were simply in contact with, and adhering to the external surface.

When segmentation took place in these fully impregnated eggs, their yelks seemed
to contract more powerfully, and the clear space, or respiratory chamber, formed in
each became much Jarger than in others from the same mass in which but a few
spermatozoa were detected ; s0 that the inference deducible from the fact seemed to
be, that a plurality of spermatozoa is necessary for the full impregnation of the egg,
and the production of the robust and healthy embryo—although simple fecundation
may result from the influence of only a very few spermatozoa, especially when such
influence is aided by a considerable increase in the temperature of the surrounding
medium,

Mode of Penetration by the Spermatozoon.—The preceding observations on natu-
rally fecundated eggs were s0 decisive of the fact of penetration by the spermatozoa
into at least the envelopes of the egg, and of the arrival at, and partial imbedment of
these bodies in the vitellary membrane, that it seemed desirable to make further
observations, by the artificial method, with a view to ascertain more directly the
mode and circumstances of their entry; and these it was hoped might be learned
