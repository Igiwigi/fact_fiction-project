The experiments of the present
authors in this direction, though they have had the use of powertul telescopes, have not
led to any definite conclusions as to these lines, but they have both noted other remarkable
phenomena of absorption, especially on examining the spectra of the coloured stars*.

'The origin of the fixed lines of the solar spectrum must therefore still be considered
an undecided questionF. Tuminous Bands in Artificial Lights. While the spectra of some artificial lights exhibit all the coloured rays gradually
shading one into the- other, those of some other lights consist of a series of luminous
bands separated by dark spaces; and one of the most remarkable facts is this, that these
luminous bands sometimes coincide with the dark lines of the solar spectrum. Thus the
intense yellow light of the soda-flame is well known to have the same refrangibility as
D; and this ray is prominent also, according to W. A.
