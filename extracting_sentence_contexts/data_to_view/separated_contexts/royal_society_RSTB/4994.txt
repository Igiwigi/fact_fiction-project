The quadrate itself
is a comparatively large element, attached by the whole of its admedian surface to the
outer side of the quadrate ramus of the pterygoid, along which it is drawn out into a
short but quite definite pterygoid ramus; the mass of the bone stands transversely in
the skull, its outer face being in contact with the pre-operculum and the quadrate jugal,
and the whole of its lower margin forming a well-finished articular condyle. The series of bones just described I shall call the suprapterygoids. The fact that they
include the epipterygoid and the quadrate shows that they are ossifications in the palato-
quadrate cartilage, and they form the only known instance of a complete replacement
of that element by cartilage bones. That they are indeed substitution bones is fortunately
confirmed by their structure. In Megalichthys the membrane bones are very massive,
and are preserved in the Newsham shale in their full thickness and quite uncrushed.
