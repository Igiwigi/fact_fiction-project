The lesion did not involve the whole of the cortical region,
irritation of which causes movements of the opposite leg, nor was the paralysis of the
leg absolute, nor did ib affect all movements equally. Those most affected were the
movements of the foot. The case further demonstrates the important fact that a
purely cortical lesion is followed by descending degeneration through the whole

region whence the motor roots of the limb emerge. It was noted that for several days subsequent to the operation a s
tendency was observable in the right arm, especially as regards the shoulder moye. ments and when the animal extended the right arm forwards,

This receives a satisfactory explanation in the inflammatory adhesion of the mem-
branes and superficial erosion of the cortex in the region of the upper extremity of
the ascending frontral convolution and base of the first frontal.
