the crystalline structure of a piece of lead under severe compression confirms this
view. Up toa certain point the crystals are gradually flattened out in proportion to
the flattening of the whole specimen, but when the “ flow” becomes considerable it is
found that the crystals, already very thin and flat, are driven into and through one
another, this process resulting in a grain or structure which is small, but still entirely
crystalline. The action is analogous to what occurs in the fracture of a more brittle

“

metal, with this difference, that in a more brittle metal, when “slip” has gone so far
as to extend right across a crystal, the new surfaces thereby brought into contact do
not unite or “ weld,” and fracture results ; in lead the freshly exposed surfaces do weld
or re-unite under the pressure, a fact which is associated with the possession, on the
part of the metal, of great ductility. Fig. 6 is a micro-photograph showing the crystal-
line structure of ordinary cast lead magnified 12 diameters, while fig. 7 shows the much
more minute structure of freshly and severely-strained lead magnified 30 diameters.
In this and in the following experiments with lead, the process of straining was carried
out by squeezing a cast block of the metal in a compression-testing machine, letting
it expand laterally until the block, originally about 1 inch high and 3 inch diameter
was flattened into a plate about + inch thick.

In order to investigate the changes in the crystalline structure of such strained
lead, we adopted the method of taking a series of photographs of a marked area of
each specimen at intervals of time during which the metal was exposed either to the
ordinary temperature of the room or was subjected to special thermal treatment.
