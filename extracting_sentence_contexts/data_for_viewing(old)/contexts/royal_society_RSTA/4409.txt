to the difference between the optical system efficiency and the electronic switching efficiency
[45]. To what extent these benefits can be realized remains to be seen and requires both the
efficiency improvements in the hardware together with new control planes to access those
efficiency improvements.

Hybrid switching is attractive for integrating optical switching into communication systems
because of the unique functional constraints of the optics. Optical memories are still very difficult
to realize. Time of flight delays are perhaps the most common approach [46]. Computation in
general, even at very high speeds, is more efficient and cost effective using electronics than
optical technologies, unless very few, simple operations are involved [47]. From a fundamental
standpoint in fact, electronics is in principle more efficient, being limited by Johnsonâ€”-Nyquist
thermal noise, whereas optics is limited by the photon energy. Thus, the challenge becomes how
to use each of these technologies in ways that provide the best overall efficiency and performance.
The hybrid approach creates a platform through which the optics can be programmatically : =
implemented based on the service requirements. An optical connection needs to be established 3
and possibly tuned or conditioned for the signal requirements [48]. Isolating the optical control
allows this complexity to be handled separately and thereby facilitates closer inter-working of the nee)
two. The separation of the control and data plane that is inherent in this is a key element of what :
is often referred to as software-defined networking (SDN) and thus hybrid networking is further a]
compatible with emerging standards and developments in the area of SDN. DN
