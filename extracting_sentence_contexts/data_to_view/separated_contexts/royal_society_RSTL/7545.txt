of the head and antlers of which a figure was communicated to the Royal Society in Part L.
(June 9th, 1864: Cuts, tigs. 5 & 6, p. 517), justifies the inferences deduced from the works

satisfactory evidences of the affinities of the Fqurs s$pelaus. The mouth (Cut, fig. 8, @') is
not indicated by a mere line or simple incision ; the outer ridges of the Equine molars must

representing the meeting of the molars. An accurate drawing of this appearance, 80
