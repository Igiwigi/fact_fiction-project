This, in detail, means to ascertain what relation the cranium bears to
the vertebral column, the visceral arches to the ribs, and the subcutaneous cartilages to
those superadded arches of the body that sustain the limbs. "The morphological space traversed by a Salamander or Newt in passing from the first
fixation of the cartilaginous beams and bars that form its firs chondroskeleton, and
especially its first chondrocranium, to its adult state is immense ; the firs: grade shows
the framework of a fish lower by far than any save the Lancelet, and the last lands us
among forms that lie on the border of the true Reptilia. Here, amongst these types, must the morphologist search for the alphabet, and, as the
mind learns to arrange the facts, synthetically construct the grammar, of his science. To a great extent the writer has studied the relations of both the nervous and mus-
cular 8ystems as correlated with the skeletal ; here, however, he needs much friendly
help; that help has already been given in s8ome degree, but most of the work has yet
to be done,
