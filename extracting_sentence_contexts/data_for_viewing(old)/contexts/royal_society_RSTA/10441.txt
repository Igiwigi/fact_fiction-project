@ This is a complete Jacobian system. It apparently contains five members: but the
& fifth equation is a linear combination of the first four, and therefore the system really
@ consists of four equations. It involves six variables, viz., a, b, c, f, g, ; and therefore
= it possesses two independent solutions. One of these is L?; the other is easily seen
g to be be — f?, = A.

3 Returning now to the system of nine equations, and bearing in mind the fact that
3 the first eight possess two solutions, one being L? and the other being a contravariant
Es of the ternary quadratic which has A for its leading coefficient, we have the
© contravariant in the well-known form
