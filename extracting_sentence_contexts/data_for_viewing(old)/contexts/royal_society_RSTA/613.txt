describing quantum fields. Moreover, such a non-local realism with spooky action at distance is
generally considered unnatural, whereas the Copenhagen interpretation in terms of a processes
of information exchanges between quantum systems (e.g. photons) and measurement devices
(e.g. beam splitters) is largely more popular. As Bohr emphasized, quantum mechanics does
not describe quantum systems and processes as ‘they are’, but correctly predicts the outputs
of measurements performed on quantum systems, with measurement apparatuses are treated
classically. Niels Bohr writes [9,10]

This crucial point, which was to become a main theme of the discussions reported in
the following, implies the impossibility of any sharp separation between the behaviour
of atomic objects and the interaction with the measuring instruments which serve to
define the conditions under which the phenomena appear. In fact, the individuality of the

typical quantum effects finds its proper expression in the circumstance that any attempt 3

of subdividing the phenomena will demand a change in the experimental arrangement : 5

which in principle cannot be controlled. Consequently, evidence obtained under different LS
