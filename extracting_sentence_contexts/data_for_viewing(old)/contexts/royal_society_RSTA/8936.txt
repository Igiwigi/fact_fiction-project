gives the means of determining the oun to in general a unit in the sixth significant
figure. For these mantissee are usually of the order of magnitude of 0°8 and are
known to six figures. Hence, if the multiple is known, A, can itself be determined,
and since A, is a known multiple of the oun (determined by the S multiplet
separations), the oun is also known to the same degree of accuracy. Further, as the
sources of determining it are often quite independent they serve as tests of the
determinativeness of the oun itself to the same degree of accuracy. When A, is
considerable, its value is known sufficiently well for it to determine the multiple,
and then this exact integer conversely gives the exact value of A, In the cases of
A and Ne, however, the values of A, are too small to determine uniquely this multiple
directly. The difficulty, however, is surmounted by obtaining successively values
with increasing accuracy from other considerations until the final test can be applied.
As a fact the Ne oun is amongst the most accurate found. Its determination (p. 461)
is specially interesting, and indeed is only possible because the material at disposal
depends on interferential measures and large accurately known separations. That
of X also is a good determination, and is interesting as depending on a number of
quite independent data.

As the oun is proportional to the square of the atomic weight within the limits of
error of determination of the latter, it is natural to assume that the relation is exact
and that d = g.w’, where q is a number between 361'°8+'1. If this were sustained it
would be possible to obtain w with twice the degree of accuracy of the oun and
therefore far in advance of any obtainable by chemical methods. In fact the question
is raised as to what is actually understood by the atomic weight. Does it refer to
the mass of the positive nucleus, or to that and all or a portion of the electrons ?
