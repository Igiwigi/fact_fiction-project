The problem is far more acute in the quantum context, where non-locality


takes the form of the once-dreaded ‘action at a distance’, or more precisely to entanglement,
meaning that different parts of a system remain causally connected even when they are arbitrarily
far apart. This challenges our basic intuition that things interact most when they are in close
proximity. Leaving aside abundant metaphysical and science fiction based ramifications, entanglement
stands as a highly counterintuitive and difficult phenomenon to deal with by the current methods
of theoretical science. Addressing quantum correlations with machine learning is plainly a major
challenge [19].

(c) Hyper-dimensions

We are used to living in three spatial dimensions, plus time, and we are clearly often in difficulty
in going further. In fact, visualizing objects, not to mention dynamic phenomena, in just three
dimensions seems to be complicated enough, as everyone dealing with visualization software

knows all too well.
