primary centripetal wood is largely abortive. Of less interest in this connection is a
monostelic genus Heterangium, which has secondary wood but no pith,

One of the most important genera of the Cycadofilices is Medullosa. In this genus
the fibro-vascular system is polystelic, 7.¢., made up of a number of anastomosing
concentric strands. It differs strikingly from the ferns, however, in the fact that its
“‘steles” are surrounded with secondary wood, and the primary wood is often largely
abortive, being replaced by parenchyma and constituting the so-called partial piths.
The concentric strands have a varying configuration. The external ones which, on
the basis of the stelar development of the Ferns and polystelic Angiosperms we may
probably regard as primitive, often form continuous zones, while the medullary
bundles are star-shaped. The former are generally called “ plate-rings,” the latter
“‘star-rings.” An interesting feature of the same genus is the fact that the
internally formed secondary wood of the plate-rings is often a very thin layer as
compared with the outer zone. In a Medullosa with a single layer of plate-rings
only, this would lead to a condition closely resembling that described above in
Lyginodendron robustum, &e.

Poronit is of the opinion that the modern Cycads arose from Medullosan ancestors
by the abortion of the primary cryptogamic wood and the disappearance of the
centripetal secondary xylem of the cauline bundles. He thus regards the Cycads as
resulting by a process of reduction from polystelic ancestors, just as appears to have
