settled in the locality. The locusts either settled directly on these clumps as migration
slackened toward evening, or they settled in the fields and later flew up into the trees before
nightfall. Of settled swarms observed by us, all were crowded on the tallest vegetation
available. If that consisted of only a few shrubs and small trees these were heavily laden
with locusts, with the rest of the swarm less thick on the ground. One swarm was found
settled at Morendat, Kenya, on 22 April 1944, in park-like country with irregularly spaced
trees of various sizes, and the locusts had gathered almost exclusively on the upper parts of
the tallest of them.

REVIEW AND ANALYSIS
Influences affecting swarm behaviour
The condition of the locusts
The fact that full migratory flying does not appear immediately after the final moult, but
develops gradually, was made clear by Uvarov in his book (1928; see also Predtechensky
19354; Khan 1945; Johnston & Buxton 1949). Further aspects of this process, brought out

here (pp. 173-175), are that the hardening of the cuticle is not complete even when the
young locusts have started persistent mass flying, and that, associated with the softness of
the body perceptible for a number of days after the last moult, there is a lack of power in
flight, reflected in the inability of fledglings to make headway against weaker winds than
fully hardened locusts. In this way fledglings develop the habit of persistent flight before
they are strong enough to resist carriage by the wind as well as older migrants do, which is
