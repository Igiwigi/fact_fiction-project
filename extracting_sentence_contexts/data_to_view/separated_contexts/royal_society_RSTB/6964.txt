The
endocrine state in some post-partum rodents appears to be similar in many ways to that
of oestrus, as shown by the regularity with which mice and rats and non-suckling post-
partum rabbits come into oestrus within a few days of delivery. Therefore, the similarity
of the responses of the oestrous and post-partum uteri to stimulation of the pituitary is
hardly surprising. : -

It is difficult at first sight to see any physiological significance underlying the fact that
the rabbit possesses a means for increasing the activity of the empty oestrous uterus, a means
that involves a nervous and glandular transmission of stimuli. One possible function served
by this mechanism may be the transportation of spermatozoa from the vagina to the
uterine cavity during and after coitus. It is generally admitted that coitus in the rabbit
stimulates the activity of the adenohypophysis by a reflex pathway through the hypo-
thalamus and infundibular stem.
