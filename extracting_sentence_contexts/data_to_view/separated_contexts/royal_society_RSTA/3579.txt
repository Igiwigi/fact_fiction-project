Some fronto-parietal, striatal and hippocampal regions
notably spent a greater proportion of the time acting as ‘connector hubs’ promoting global
integration, as estimated by high cross-modular connectivity. However, it is actually another class
of regions, termed ‘peripheral nodes’, which dominates the dynamical cartographic landscape:
peripheral nodes were characterized by low-to-medium within-module connectivity and low
between-module connectivity. This indicates that that the majority of brain regions are in fact

Figure 7. Measures of spatio-temporal integration and segregation. (a) Dynamic cartographic analysis performed on empirical [4
FC data. Each time window (top) is broadly partitioned into either an ‘integrated’ topological state or ‘segregated’ topological DNS
state using k-means clustering.
