'= gelves differ in shape in being multipolar and in having as many as six processes, while
= 8ome are pear-shaped. They usually measure about 00093 millim. by 0-007 millim.
Â© The nearly obliterated ventricle and the infundibulum are surrounded by a layer of
.& gmall cells as in other Teleostei. These bodies may be considered to be in a rudi-
:2 mentary condition, and this is shown also by the absence of the nucleus rotundus and
= the transverse commissure connected with it.

S Tecta Lobi Optici.

5 The position of these bodies in the Mormyride has become quite reversed. Instead
ZZ of arching over the tori semicirculares on the dorsal ide of the brain as in the ordi-
S nary Teleostei, they become relegated to the inferior surface and occupy a position
= below and to the outside of those bodies ; the roof in fact has been transferred to the
S foundation.

= The tecta appear to have attained this position in consequence of the enormous
S development of the wings alluded to in the first part of this paper.

E Accompanying this change of position there is a considerable degradation of struc-
S ture. The even layers which are distinguishable in M. cephalus are here reduced
to two or ab the most three ; the ependyma has disappeared ; there are only slight
indications of radial striation. The outer layer in some places is separable into two
8ubordinate divisions. The Mormyride are not good subjects for deciding any histo-
logical points in the structure of these lobes which as I have before remarked are
decidedly undeveloped ; I was therefore not surprised to find that I am unable either
