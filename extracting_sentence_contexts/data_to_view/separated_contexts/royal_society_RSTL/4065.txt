GroTTHUS appears to/have considered the combination of gases
by the electric spark as an effect of sudden compression or molecular approximation,
certain particles being brought within the range of their affinities by the sudden
dilatation of others. Although he did not pursue the subject far enough to ascertain
whether a degree of rarefaction could be reached which would be an actual bar to
combination, till his experiments strengthen those views which assimilate mechanical
and thermic molecular repulsion, and regard chemical affinity as being antagonized
by physical repulsion. Pursuing the series of analogies from the decomposition of euchlorine at a low
temperature, that of ammonia at a higher, that of metallic oxides at a higher, and 80
on to oxide of hydrogen, there appears to be an extensive series of facts which afford
Strong hope of a generalized antagonism between thermic repulsion and chemical

physical and chemical attraction.
