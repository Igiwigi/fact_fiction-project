S is found; that the containing system of the blood-proper is distinguished, with the
E single exception of that of the Echinodermata, by the absence of vibratile cilia from
g its internal lining membrane, while that of the chylaqueous fluid is provided in the
& 8ame Situations, almost invariably, with these motive organules ; that the contents
6 of the former system are propelled by the contractile force of its muscular parietes,
S while those of the latter are circulated chiefly by ciliary vibration ; that below the
= Echinodermata the blood-proper is wholly snpplanted by the chylaqueous fluid ;
A that above the Annelida the latter fluid in the adult animal is superseded by the
true-blood ; that in the Echinoderms and Annelids these two systems of nutrient
flaids co-exist, bearing always to each other, in the same individual, an inverse
quantitative proportion; that in the Mollusca these two are united into a single
system, in which the essential characteristics of both are legible; and that these
facts, hitherto unrecognised in their physiological connection, and unappreciated in
their separate meaning, are calculated to elucidate, with new clearness, the processes
of digestion, sanguification, and respiration, more especially in the lowest classes of
invertebrate animals; and finally, that they suggest inquiry from novel points of
view, into seyeral important questions in z00-chemistry.

In this communication it is my desire to restrict myself chiefly to the demonstra-
tion of the corpuscular or morphotic elements of the fluids, postponing to a future
occasion the attempt to apply the results of these researches to the problems in com-
