3. A composite state determines states of subsystems (so the local state of S is restored when the
state of the whole S and € is restored).

These facts help to characterize local states of entangled systems without using reduced density
matrices. They follow from quantum theory: locality is a property of interactions. The other two
facts define the role and the relation of the quantum states of individual and composite systems in
a way that does not invoke density matrices (to which we are not entitled in the absence of Born’s
Rule). Thus, phase shift ug ® 1e = (| Tt | + | LL |) @ Ie acting on a pure pre-decoherence
state matters: measurement can reveal g. In accord with facts 1 and 2, ug changes a| t) + A] |) into
a|t) +e” B| |). However, the same ug acting on S in an entangled state |se) does not matter for
S alone, as it can be undone by 1s ® (let er| +e” ley Ney), a countershift acting on a faraway,
decoupled €. As the global |Ws¢) is restored, by fact 3 the local state of S is also restored even if
S is not acted upon (so that, by fact 1, it remains unchanged). Hence, the local state of decohered
S that one obtains from |s¢) could not have changed to begin with, and so it cannot depend on
the phases of a and p.

The only pure states invariant under such phase shifts (unaffected by decoherence) are pointer
states. Resilience, as we saw, equations (2.1) and (3.1), lets them preserve correlations. For
instance, the entangled state of the measured system S and the apparatus, |ys_4), equation (3.2),
decoheres as A interacts with E:

(al t)IAs) + BI LIAy)leo) S45 al t)LAs) le) + BI 1)IAy) ley) = ste) (4.3)


The pointer states |A+) and |A,) of A survive decoherence by €. They retain perfect correlation
