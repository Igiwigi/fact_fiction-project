LAWS OF ELECTRICAL CHANGE BY INDUCTION, 223

gated in the conductor equally in all directions, thus exhibiting in a remarkable way
one of the primary laws of fluids.

13. Since these facts furnish some evidence in fayour of the conclusion that elec-
trical phenomena result from certain changes in the distribution of a subtle kind
of matter associated with the particles of bodies, it may not be unimportant to ex-
amine the laws of these changes in the cases of induction and attraction above men-
tioned. It must be apparent by experiments 4, 5, 6, figs. 3, 4, that in the ordinary attract-
ive force between a body positively charged with electricity, and a neutral body N in
a free state, three actions arise claiming particular notice, viz. a receding of the na-
tural electricity of the neutral body, from the points nearest the body charged posi-
tively ; a passing of electricity from the remote points of the positively charged body
toward the neutral body ; lastly, a tendency of the opposite electrical forces to come
together and enter into a species of union ; which last condition seems to be the im-
mediate cause of these two bodies approaching each other, all impediment to motion
being removed.

14. With a view of discovering some of the laws of these induced changes, I resorted
to the method represented in Plate IV. fig. 8, in which A, B are two flat discs of wood
covered with tin foil, insulated on varnished glass rods, A d, B p.
