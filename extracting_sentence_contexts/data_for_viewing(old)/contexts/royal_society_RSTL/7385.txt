cells*, one of which is situated just external to each lateral tract (A, A), and also a 8ma
bundle of fibres from the nervi laterales. Although nerve-fibres have been detected onl
in the anterior part of the body of 4. lumbricoides and other Nematoids, I have not th
slightest doubt that peripheral branches do exist throughout the body generally ; an
from what I have seen of the course of one large fibre proceeding backwards from on
of the lateral ganglion-cells, I suspect that they generally pass beneath the muscles t
gain the deep cellular layer of the integument, in which they are principally distribute
and from which they can 80 easily give off filaments to the muscles or to tactile papilla
I distinetly saw a fibre (marked e) leaving the 8ubstance of the lateral cord and passin
beneath the muscular bundle lying outside it. Dr. SCHNEIDER 8eems inclined to thin
that some large nerve-fibres may pass posteriorly in the substance of the dorsal an
ventral median lines, though he has never absolutely traced nerve-fibres passing from th
central ring into these bodies. He rests his opinion upon the fact that in fine transverg
Sections which he has made of the median lines, he has found them perforated length
wise by cavities having an elliptical or oval cross section; which tubes or cavities, bv
sates, are invariably filled with a transparent, homogeneous s8ubstance of a reddish 9
yellowish tint. He says that from 8ix to eight 8uch bodies can be detected in thi
ventral median line of A. megalocephala, but only from four to six in the dorsal. Thea
are considered to be transverse sections of nerve-fibres; but the fact that they have *
distinctly larger diameter than the principal nerve-fibres issuing from the ganglion-celk
seems to me s8trongly opposed to this view. I have myself been unable to recogniz
such structures in the median lines, 80 must refer for further details concerning them to
Dr. ScaxzDER's important memoir.

The nervous system of Ozyuris curvula has also been carefully examined by SCHNEIDED
