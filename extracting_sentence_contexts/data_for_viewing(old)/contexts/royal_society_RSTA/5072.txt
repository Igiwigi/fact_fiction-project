cyclic strain localization threshold in UHCEF. For further details, the original publication should
be consulted [34].

(c) Fatigue damage of type II materials in the ultrahigh cycle fatigue regime

Failure by subsurface ‘fish-eye’ cracking at inclusions is typical of type II materials in the UHCF
range. In the schematic multistage fatigue life diagram in figure 13 which is based on results
of different researchers [19,20,67-69], the LCF, HCF and UHCF ranges of type II materials
are displayed. In addition to the conventional HCF fatigue limit, there is a second fatigue
limit at substantially lower loading amplitudes in the UHCF range. The borderline separating
conventional fatigue lives in LCF and HCF from UHCF fatigue lives is indicated. In the transition
