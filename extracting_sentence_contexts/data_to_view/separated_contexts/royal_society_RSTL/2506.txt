Under such a combination of fayourable cireumstances, the circular rainbow ap-
peared quite perfect, of the most vivid colours, one half above the leyel on which I
stood, the other half below it. Shadows in distinct outline of myself, my horse, and
people appeared in the centre of the circle as in a picture, to which the bow formed
a resplendent frame. My attendants were incredulous that the figures they saw un-
der such extraordinary cireumstances could be their own shadows, and they tossed
their arms and legs about, and put their bodies into varipus postures, to be as-
sured of the fact by the corresponding movements of the objects within the cirele ;
and it was some little time ere the superstitious feeling with which the spectacle

was viewed wore off. From our proximity to the fog, I believe the diameter of the
circle at no time exceeded fifty or sixty feet. The brilliant circle was accompanied
with the usual outer bow in fainter colours.
