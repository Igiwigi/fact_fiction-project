By the method of moments, this should be given by the first moment, that is by the
mean of the observations: such would seem to be at least a good estimate. It is,
however, entirely valueless. he distribution of the mean of such samples is in fact the
same, identically, as that of a single observation. In taking the mean of 100 values of
x, we are no nearer obtaining the value of m than if we had chosen any value of « out
of the 100. The problem, however, is not in the least an impracticable one: clearly
from a large sample we ought to be able to estimate the centre of the distribution with
some precision ; the mean, however, is an entirely useless statistic for the purpose.
By taking the median of a large sample, a fair approximation is obtained, for the standard

error of the median of a large sample of n is —*—, which, alone, is enough to show that
