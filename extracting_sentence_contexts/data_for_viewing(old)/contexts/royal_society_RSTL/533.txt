quicksilver, the mercury in the thermometer, whose bulb was
still surrounded by the condensed gas, rose about 1+ degree.
On agitating the vessel, till the water encompassed the bulb of
the thermometer, an elevation of barely 4 a degree ensued in
the temperature of the water. This ascent would probably have
been greater, if the evolved heat had not been carried off by the
mercury on which the water floated.

Manchester,

Dec. 8th, 1802,

* That the facts did not, with invariable accuracy, correspond to the law, was
perhaps, in part, owing to the addition of only 28 inches of pressure ; when, in strict-
ness, 295 $hould have been used, or twice the elgyation of the mercury in the
barometer, during each experiment.
