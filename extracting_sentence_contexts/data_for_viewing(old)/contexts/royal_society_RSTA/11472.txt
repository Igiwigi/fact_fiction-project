pillars adequate to maintain rigidity. It is closed at the top by a stout diaphragm,

serves the double object of acting as a non-conducting roof tu the interference
chamber, to prevent upward radiation and consequent loss of heat into the supporting

tube, and of correcting the slight prismatic deviation of the light rays introduced by
making the cover-wedge slightly wedge-shaped. The correction is achieved by
making the dise, e, equally wedge-shaped. In fact, the two discs are cut from the
same piece of plate glass, which has been ground down so that the two perfectly
plane surfaces are 35 minutes out of parallelism. The direction of the wedge is
marked by a straight line engraved parallel to the long edge of the slab before
cutting the dises from it. The latter are so cut that this engraved line comes near
the margin of each, forming a chord of the circle. It is only necessary to place the
two discs so that the engraved chords are parallel and on the same side of the centre,
but so that the marked surface of the larger dise of the interference apparatus lies
uppermost while that of the smaller diaphragm disc lies underneath, when the
refractive effect is fully counteracted. In order that no reflections shall be visible
due to the two surfaces of the counteracting diaphragm wedge, the latter is slightly
tilted by means of two very small screws driven through the rabbet of the aperture
from the under side in such positions that the line joining them is parallel to the
