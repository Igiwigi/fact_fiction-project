from only one compound, or where the different determinations are not fairly accordant.

At some future time I hope to reexamine each of the doubtful points, and to extend
the observations to the whole range of the chemical elements. 'The question of disper-
slon-equivalents is also of interest : the data for an investigation of the matter are
given in the Appendix, since the refractive index has been calculated for the lines D and
H, as well as the line A; but I have avoided encumbering the present paper with any
remarks on this subject.

The specific refractive energy of a body is in some respects worthy of more considera-
tion than the refraction-equiyalent, for it is a physical property independent of chemical
theories. If these energies in the preceding Table are compared with one another
several suggestive facts may be observed.

1st, Hydrogen has more than double the energy of any other element, even in the
lowest number that can be assigned to it.

2nd. Phosphorus, vanadium, titanium, and sulphur have singularly high energies,
and they are substances that present, certain chemical analogies.

3rd. There are several pairs of analogous elements having the same, or nearly the
same, energy ; thus, bromine and iodine, arsenic and antimony, potassium and sodium,
manganese and iron, nickel and cobalt.

4th. An element in altering its quantivalence alters its energy.
