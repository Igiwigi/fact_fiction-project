368 DR. A. HILL ON THE CEREBRUM OF ORNITHORHYNCHUS PARADOXUS,

rately and beautifully figured in Mecket’s monograph.* He represents correetly ¢
pyriform shape of the hemispheres ; their surface perfectly smooth save for the
grooves cut by the blood-vessels which, emerging from beneath the outer sides of the
olfactory bulbs, radiate backwards. Mecken does not appear, however, to ha:
noticed the middle cerebral artery. He figures the blood-vessels which groove the
internal surface of the hemisphere, as well as the deep groove which is continued
forwards from above the hippocampus to the anterior extremity of the brain. The
figure of a sagittal section in the median plane (Plate 7, fig. 7) is drawn with great
accuracy, but the references to the figure are singularly incorrect, so incorrect, in fact,
that we should infer that the pointer-lines were wrongly placed by the engraver if
their disposition did not agree entirely with the description in the text. As the
mistakes are made with regard to just those features which are, owing to the position
of this animal amongst vertebrates, of highest importance, it is necessary to quote the
words of the text in connection with the lettering of the figures. In the figure the
hippocampus or ridge produced by the projection of the fascia dentata is called the
“corpus callosum.” The transverse commissure, which seems to take the place of the
corpus callosum, is lettered as the “septum pellucidum.” That there is no mistake in
the lettering of the figures is evident from the following description of the former
structuret :—“ Corpus callosum adest quidem, sed breve, quum haud quatuor lineas
longitudine aequet. Memorabilius etiam videtur, in dimidia duo lateralia, linea
mediana haud confluentia, esse disjunctum. Equidem saltem in faciebus sese spec- :
