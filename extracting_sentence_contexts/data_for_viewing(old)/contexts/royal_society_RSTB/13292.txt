android pelvis [4]; if non-gynaecoid pelves are more often
associated with fetal positions and rotations that differ from
the model of ‘normal’ childbirth described in textbooks, this
mismatch could ring alarm bells and precipitate birth inter-
ventions even in the absence of obstructed labour [47].

4, Why the current model of the ‘normal’ pelvis
and childbirth is problematic

There is good evidence that the shape of the birth canal is
highly variable and tends to differ both within and among
human populations, and that using the gynaecoid shape as
a model for all women is empirically unsupported, factually
inaccurate and potentially dangerous, especially for women
of non-European ancestry. Expectations of normal labour
progression have been largely shaped by Friedman’s studies
of white American women, on the basis of which he
suggested a subdivision into a first phase of labour character-
ized by cervical dilation, and a second phase characterized by
active pushing [48,49]. He indicated the normal duration of
these phases based on his sample, and these time ranges
became benchmarks to determine when a labour was delayed
(i.e. not ‘normal’) and intervention might be needed [50-53].
Several studies have, however, reported differences in the
length of labour in women of different ancestry. Kolawole
