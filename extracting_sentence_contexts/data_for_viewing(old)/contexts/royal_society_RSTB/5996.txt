to obscure all details underlying them.

It is difficult to understand how SrorcH came to his conclusions, because he most
emphatically denies the existence of a forward current in the food groove (1924, p. 230).
If he is so certain of this he surely must have seen clearly into the food groove, but, on
the other hand, if the gnathobases come together in the middle line during the backstroke,
he cannot have done so.

Srorcu believes that the residue filtered on to the filter combs is sucked towards the
mid-ventral line and transported to the mouth, not by a food current, but by the sete
on the gnathobasic lobe of the second trunk limb. The middle group of sete on the
gnathobasic lobe, he states, sweep the food forwards because of their curvature and the
fact that they move in the arc of a circle, but only in the case of the anterior three or
four does the lower part of the arc through which they swing, point very slightly forwards;
all the others sweep backwards on their downstroke towards the floor of the food groove.
But even supposing that SrorcH were correct, the hindmost of the middle group of
setee only reaches as far as the anterior edge of the fourth trunk limb gnathobase.
Thus all the residue behind this, that is, all that collected on the fourth limb and on

more than half of the third limb, has to be transported forwards somehow to reach the
middle group sete.

This he states is carried out by the posteriorly directed spines which scrape off the
residue and transport it forwards; â€œ... die Partikelchen flott machen und nach
