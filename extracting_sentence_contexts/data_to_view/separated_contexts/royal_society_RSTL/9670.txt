qui, dans le faiscean lib6ro-lignens de la tige on des feuilles, presentent un double
accroissement, V'un centripdte, Vautre centrifuge.” My friend here reasserts the old
Brongniartian hypothesis in all its definiteness. Tf the evidence produced in the pre-
ceding pages is nob sufficient to demonstrate the erroneousness of this hypothesis, I
am wholly unable to conceive what kind or number of facts would accomplish that end. The enormous number of Lepidodendroid and allied plants that have now been
described by M. Rexavir and myself seem to me to justify an attempt to ascertain
what bearing our discoveries may have upon the problem of Evolution. In making this
attempt we must not forget that, whilst our researches have been confined to carboni-
ferous plants, the discoveries of Dr. Dawsoxn have shown that the differentiation of
the Gymnospermous Dadoxylons from the Cryptogamic Lycopods was as definite in
the Devonian age as in that which sneceeded it.
