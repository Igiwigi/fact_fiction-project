A glance at the lines of totals in the table will show that the herbage became
almost exclusively gramineous under the influence of the luxuriance induced by the
nitrogenous manure, and the tendency to stem-formation and maturation favoured by
the associated mineral constituents. Thus, in the last separation-year nearly 95 per
cent. of the mixed herbage was referable to gramineous species, not half a per cent. to
Leguminosz, and nob 5 per cent. to Miscellanere. Taking the average of the four separation-years there was, in fact, nearly three times
as much gramineous herbage per acre as without manure, nearly twice as much as by
the ammonia-salts alone, and not far from twice as much as with the mineral manure
alone. Reckoned in the same way, there was, on the average, not much more than
one-twentieth as much legumineous herbage as without manure, rather more than
with ammonia-salts alone, and only about one-hundredth as much as with the mineral
manure alone. Turning to the total miscellaneous species a little more is yielded on
the average by the mixed nitrogenous and mineral manure than withoub manure,
about one-third more than by the ammonia-salts alone, bub even less than by the
mineral manure alone.
