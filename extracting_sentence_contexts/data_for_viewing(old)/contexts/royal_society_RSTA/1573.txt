application of this physical concept has attracted growing attention in recent years both because
it provides a relatively simple parametric amplification scheme, and such bichromatic signals
with widely separated frequencies are common in the internal and surrounding environment of
living organisms. For instance, many neurons are under the influence of multiple rhythms with
disparate time scales [25], from milliseconds to days, including fast pacemaker activity, one or
more brain rhythms, neuromodulatory activity such as slow circadian rhythms, and two-time
scale bursting activity coming from afferent cells [26].

The neural system involving numerous complex vital functions can be viewed also as a
network that can be represented with nodes (neurons) and links (synapses). Recent findings from
neuroimaging studies have provided strong evidence that neuron populations exhibit complex
topologies at all scales and that neuronal functions are not solely attributable to biological
and chemical processes, but also to neuronal connectivity. Considering this fact, recent SR and


VR studies in neural systems have focused on the impacts of topological features of neural
networks on successful detection and transmission of weak signals. In this context, complex
network models derived from graph theoretical analysis of neuroimaging data provide a useful
environment for the computational study of these two resonance phenomena.

In this review, a coalescence of recent intriguing SR and VR studies in neuronal media is
presented. More precisely, our focus is on weak signal detection via both phenomena in complex
neuronal networks in the light of experimental and theoretical findings. We have tried to make
it as comprehensive as possible to guide further research. After briefly introducing these two
phenomena and their neural interpretation, the remainder of this review is organized as follows:
