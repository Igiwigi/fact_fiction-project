We turn next to the consideration of the effects of very close discharges. While the
number of field-changes observed is rather low, yet they represent the closest flashes
from a number of storms, and it would seem to be established that the proportion of
negative field-changes is considerably greater for flashes within 3 km. of the observer
than for flashes at slightly greater distances. The fact that a similar effect occurs
among both simple and complex field-changes strengthens belief in its reality. Again,
the very large field-changes, those greater than 15,000 V/m., also show a considerably
higher proportion of negative field-changes than the field-changes in the range 5000
15,000 V/m., although the effect is not so well marked as when variation with distance
is considered. (By no means all of the field-changes greater than 15,000 V/m. were
within 3 km.)
