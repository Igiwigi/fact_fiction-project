Because while the
measurement is being made considerable changes may take place in the vapour
present in the surrounding atmosphere. Further, it takes no direct account of
temperature, and so in interpreting the results one has to keep in mind that the
quantity of liquid evaporated is an unknown function of both temperature and vapour
pressure. This fact alone accounts for the complexity of many of the empirical

* formulee which haye been proposed. Then there is the velocity of the wind, in

addition to possible free convection currents: introducing further complications to
both experiment and theory. The following are samples of formulee which have been proposed to represent the
relation between evaporation, vapour pressure and wind velocity.
