late the activity of all potential ionic species based on mean
measured anion and cation concentrations. This is informative,
because in more concentrated solutions, it may be necessary to
account for the fact that ions behave as though their concen-
trations are lower than nominal or measured concentrations,
i.e. an ion’s ‘activity’ will probably be less than its concentration 2 ° . :
