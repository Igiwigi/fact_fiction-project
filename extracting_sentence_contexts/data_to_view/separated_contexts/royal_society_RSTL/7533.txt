tidean folds of mucous membrane, and was COT to the mucous membrane
hel apparently giving off no muscular branches.
t Ty an the ala of the thyroid cartilage an Accessory
glottideus muscle was exposed ; it was s0mewhat triangular in shape, and arose from
anterior and external angle of the arytenoid cartilage ; from this the fibres Passed 1
wards, diverging, and were inserted into the side of the fibrocartilaginous pedicle of
epiglottis, posterior to which its fibres coalesced with those of its fellow of the opposi
= thyroarytenoid muscle was united to the posterior border of that last described,
in fact both appeared to be but parts of one large muscular expansion; it arose from
the yertical median ridge on'the superior surface of the thyroid cartilage, where its fibres
were distinctly separate from the foregoing muscle ; it passed forwards and inwards, and
was inserted into the anterior and external margins of the arytenoid cartilage, and into
the contiguous margin of the cricoid. |

There were no vestiges of chord yocales or of a yentricle, or a lateral laryngeal 8ac-
culus; but situated in front of the cavity of the larynx, and opening by a wide orifice
immediately at the root of the epiglottis, there was a remarkable large musculo-membra-
nous mesial sac or laryngeal pouch, which extended downwards and backwards in front
of the trachea; its walls, which were thick, were almost entirely composed of circular
muscular fibres, which anteriorly or nearer the glottis took their origin from the upper
surface of the thyroid cartilage, and posteriorly formed a series of circles with no defi-
nite origin or insertion. The interior of this cul-de-sac communicated directly with the
central portion of the laryngeal cavity by a wide orifice, and was lined by a continuation
of the mucous membrane of the former. From the situation and structure of this pouch its probable use was to assist, by the
contraction of its walls, in the act of expiration, increasing the expulsive force of the re-
spiratory apparatus, by the sndden contraction of its circular fibres expelling the con-
tained air, and s0 not only considerably augmenting this power, but also sustaining the |
expiratory current, more especially towards the termination of this act.
