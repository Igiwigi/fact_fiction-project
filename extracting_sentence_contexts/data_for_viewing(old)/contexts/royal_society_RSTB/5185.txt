The fundi of the Reptiles bear no resemblance whatever to those of the Amphibia.
Moreover, in the former the different Sub-classes, Orders and Sub-orders have each
characteristic features, which at once distinguish them both from one another and from
the fundi of Birds and Mammals.

To this there are two exceptions :—First, in the Geckos, it is interesting to note
that the fundus bears a striking resemblance to that of the Apteryx. They all
have a brick-red fundus, and circular, or nearly circular, disc, which is provided with a
large conical pecten, resembling the thalamus of a raspberry, which fills the entire
surface of the disc. No trace of blood vessels can be perceived in any of the
Geckos’ eyes, and there is certainly no trace of a macula, which is readily seen in
close proximity to the disc in the Apteryx’s eye. In fact, this is the one striking
point of difference between the two. (See Plate 22.)

The other exception is that of the Sphenodon. The fundus of this animal possesses
many of the characteristic features of the Bufonide, and also in a few points those of the
Echidna. ‘Thus the fundus in each case has a warm rather dark reddish-grey colour, to
which in the Sphenodon and the Bufonide is added a mottling of gold spots or stippling.
