formed of solid bandaite with some well-consolidated agglomerate, indicate that from
this volcano a large amount of more superficial, and less consolidated, volcanic material
has been swept away. * This implies erosion that is probably too prolonged and too
profound to be attributed to Pleistocene and Recent times.
