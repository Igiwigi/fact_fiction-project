Now Table VIIL, or fig. 9,
shows that, for amorphous silver of normal specific gravity (u = 1), nx/d is least for
the more refrangible rays. Again, Table IX., or fig. 11, shows that, for » = 1, M, is
greatest for the same rays. It follows therefore, from equation (23) above, that, on
both these accounts, the light transmitted by silver leaf should be blue; and, in fact,
silver leaf transmits.a deep blue light. The approximately equal values of the
reflecting power, Ry, shown in Table IX., or fig. 13, for » = 1, correspond to the
almost colourless reflection from polished normal silver. Consider now the colour changes which, according to figs.
