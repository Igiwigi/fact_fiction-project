with the particular snbstance taken in a way on which it is not now necessary to
dwell. The decomposition caused by platinum and carbon, however strange, is not
quite without parallel. But the simultaneous reduction of the peroxide of hydrogen
and the oxide of silyer is a solitary fact, by the side of which chemists have been able
to place scarcely an analogous much less a similar instance. Yet eminent chemists
have offered an explanation of these phenomena, and if these are adequate, further in-
quiry is unnecessary. I shall not criticise the absolute or the relative value of these
explanations ; but they add s0 much to the interest of the question, so clearly show
the difficulties under which chemical theory has Jaboured in dealing with these facts,
and also, as I believe, how inadequate it has proved to meet them, that I shall briefly
mention the most remarkable.

The following quotation gives the impression made by these facts upon TatnaRD,
who first discovered them :â€”
