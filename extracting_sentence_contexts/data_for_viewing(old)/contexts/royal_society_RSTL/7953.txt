of the curyed lateral arial stems, appear entirely deyoid of all but these smaller cica-
tricule. Hence we may conclude that in all instances the atrial branches were of small
diameter. 'These inferences are snstained by what we know of their minute organiza-
tion. In my memoir on Calamopitus I gave figures of several transverse sections of these
branches as seen in tangential sections of the main stem (oc. cit. tab. 3, fig. 6; tab. 4,
fig. 15), whilst in a diagram representing a longitudinal section (tab. 5, fig. 17) I showed
how these branches spring directly from the innermost, part of the woody zone exactly
at the node; at the same time I pointed out that, in the sections in question, the dia-
meter of each branch never exceeded the width of one of the small longitudinal ridges,
8een on the surface of cach Calamite. I have now further evidence of the correctness

* This position of the roots was long ago shown by Lixprey and Horrox in the * Fosxil Flora of Great Britain,‚Äù
Tab. 78 A; but I have again dwelt upon it because the fact was disputed at the Liverpool Meeting of the British
Asxsociation.

of these conclusions. Plate XXVIIL. fig. 37 represents part of a longitudinal section of
the specimen of Calamopitus, of which figs. 19 to 25 inclusive exhibit other aspects.
Like figs. 23 & 24 it is a vertical section which has traversed one of the horizontal por-
tions (37 e) into which each longitudinal canal, in that variety, divides at the node: we
have the usnal arched nodal arrangement of the wood-vessels; and at mis indicated the
position of a branch of which the tissues have perished, 8nch a branch being identical
with those indicated in Plate XXVI. fig. 25 m, at the lower extremity of the primary
