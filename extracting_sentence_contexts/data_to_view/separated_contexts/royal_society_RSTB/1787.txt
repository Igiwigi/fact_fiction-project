All that we can establish at
present is that the interior is filled with a protoplasmic body, in the centre of which
lies a single yellow-green chromatophore. The central channels in each plate naturally suggest protoplasmic protrusions from
the cell, though no trace of them was observed in any of the specimens. That the
protoplasm passes at least into the canal of the plate is suggested by analogy with
Rhabdosphera Tubifer (to be described later) ; and further, the fact that the external
depression and canal within the plate sometimes become filled with colour under the
action of gentian violet, also points in the same direction, The stain, however, may
have been held in the minute cavity only by capillarity. The only evidence we can bring forward as to the method of reproduction of
Coccosphera leptopora is an isolated observation of an individual which was obviously
undergoing fission into two (Plate 15, fig. 7). *
