It is probably the jaw of a rather young!
animal, inasmuch as the two premolars which remain are very little worn. - The species
appears to have been about the size of the common Ox. The length of the series of two
premolars and two molars is 45, and the dimensions of the individual teeth are the

The second premolar is peculiar in having a double columella, which is rather curious,
since several other molar teeth were met with in the Flint-knife Gallery and in the West
Chamber, all of which present the same peculiarity *. One of these, a third molar of
the right side, in fact fits 80 exactly and corresponds in other respects 80 closely with
the teeth remaining in the jaw, that one might almost suppose it belonged to the same
set, were it not that it is very much more deeply stained with black. A left second
Sper molar, also found in the Flint-knife Gallery, and a third left upper molar found
i the West Chamber, are furnished with the same double columella, and in most
xSpects correspond 80 closely with the same teeth of the right side in the jaw, as almost
tx justify the supposition that they belonged to the same individual ; they are, however,
mach more deeply stained and rather less worn. DLhe peculiarity referred to in these teeth is shown in Plate XLVI. fig. 11.
