This approach can raise awareness of
the issue of pollinator decline, the risks associated with not
taking action, and the potential actions for conservation,
and is often aimed at interdisciplinary researchers, non-scien-
tists and decision-makers. One framework that has been
developed to explicitly link people and nature for such audi-
ences is the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on
Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) conceptual
framework [97]. This recognizes several components of natu-
ral and social systems, operating at various spatio-temporal
scales, and was specifically developed to address the fact
that reversing biodiversity loss requires interdisciplinary col-
laboration, and that institutions, governance and decision-
making play a central role [97]. Despite receiving criticism
for being centred on economic norms and instrumental
values [98], the framework was adopted to communicate
the core concepts of the IPBES Assessment Report on Pollina-
tors, Pollination and Food Production Summary for
Policymakers [99]. In this way, the conceptual framework
explicitly addressed issues regarding pollinators and linked
them under three headings: A.
