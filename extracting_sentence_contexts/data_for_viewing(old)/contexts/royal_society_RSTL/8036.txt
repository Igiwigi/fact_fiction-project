statical strains and acted only in one direction, whereas the strains of waves are, as we
have seen, constantly changing in character and intensity, and are therefore yery much
more trying to the structure. The result of careful observations showed, however, that
there was scarcely any change of form in this iron-built ship, the maximum amount of
breakage being x7 inch only in a length of 342 feet, and this becoming reduced to TF
inch when the ship was floated.

The very various positions which ships occupy when they ground may all be supposed
to lie between the position where the only support is found at the middle of the length,
and that where there are supports only at the extremities Mr. Fa1RBAIRN has chosen
these extreme positions as those by which the provision of longitudinal strength in a
ship should be regulated ; and while I cannot entirely agree with this choice, on account
of the fact that such positions are never occupied except by a few ships, and by them
only in consequenece of accidents, I am prepared to admit that there are cases on record
which show that such positions may be occupied. Ships have, for example, grounded
on rocky bottoms and on causeways, and have been left by the tide with their ends un-
gupported ; and others have grounded in such a manner as to be supported at the extre-
mities only. Under these cireumstances it may be well, therefore, to attempt an approxi-
mation to the limiting values of the strains incidental to the extreme positions of support
ashore, and to compare them with the statical strains which have been calculated for
ships at sea.

The most severe strains to which a ship aground can be subjected are those incidental
to support at the bow and stern only. In this position the heavy-weighted amidship
portion, of course, tends to make the ship ag ; and as it is a very simple mechanical
