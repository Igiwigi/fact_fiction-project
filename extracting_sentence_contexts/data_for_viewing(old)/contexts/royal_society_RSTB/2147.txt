It will be further noticed that in the ¢ the variations tend to a more backward
position of the girdle, as a rule, whereas in the ¢ the opposite obtains.

(y) A considerable variation was found to occur with regard to the number of
nerves entering the fin behind the girdle. Their number was found to vary between
six and nine (in one case ten), though most usually six, seven, or eight were present.
As far as could be observed, the backward extension was identical on both sides
in any single individual.

The most striking feature in the numerical variation of these posterior nerves is
the proportionately large difference obtaining between male and female. In most
cases a greater number of these nerves was present in the former. This fact is
brought out in the following table :—

* These refer to the two sides of the same specimen. All the rest belong to different individuals ;
where only one side is given the other side is 29.
