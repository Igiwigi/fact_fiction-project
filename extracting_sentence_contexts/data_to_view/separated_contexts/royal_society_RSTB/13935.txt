To conclude, the take-away message is that knowledge in
a variety of forms obtained by multiple forms of learning
mechanisms clearly plays a key role in augmenting evolution
in the context of evolutionary robotics where robots have
both adaptable form and behaviour, with many potential
lines of research remaining open. This makes the process of finding a matching type more
straightforward and therefore increases the chance of being
able to bootstrap from the repository. However, it should
be clear that robots of the same type may in fact have very
different skeletons (and therefore sizes) and different layouts
of sensors/actuators, and hence even an inherited controller
may not perform well. Although finer-grained definitions of
type that accounted for these differences could be introduced,

they would reduce the probability of a match (a way to miti- Data accessibility. This article has no additional data.
