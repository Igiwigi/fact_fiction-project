s00n becomes a slit with two lips, from a greater development of the vascular tisxue
in this situation. 'These lips at firs; exercise a valvular function, in preventing the
reflux of blood from the truncus arteriosus into the ventricle. As the 8emilunar valves
become developed, this valyular function gradually becomes abolished, that of the semi-
lunar valves being substituted for it.

4. The valyular function of the lips of the slit becomes abolished by the widening of
its ends and the greater development of the central portion of each lip, especially of
the left-hand one. The widened ends of the slit ultimately form the roots of the aorta
and pulmonary artery, which have then become Separated by the growth of the septum
down the vessel into the central portion of each lip.

9. It is a remarkable fact that the rudiments of the semilunar valyes first appear on
the interior of the truncus arteriosus at a considerable distance from the heart, near the
termination of the truncus arteriosus in the branchial arteries,
one might have been led to expect.

6. It is also very remarkable that the rudiments of the anterior and inner s8emilunar
valves of each artery make their appearance before the partition, which has already
begun to separate the aorta from the pulmonary artery, has quite descended to that part
of the truncus arteriosus in which these valves originate.

7. The rudiments of the anterior semilunar valves of the aorta and pulmonary artery
are the first to appear, those of the inner valve of each artery the next, and those of the
outer valves the last. The development of the last valve to appear remains behind that
