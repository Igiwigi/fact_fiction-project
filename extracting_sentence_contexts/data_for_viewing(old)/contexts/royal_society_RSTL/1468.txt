peculiarly adapted. But is it inconsistent with the general
laws of nature, or even with the animal ceconomy, that from
their combination they should have a different action, and
thus an additional use ? To illustrate this we need only wit-
ness the action of almost any set of muscles in the body ;
for example, in li≈øting a weight, the combined action of the
muscles of the arm, shoulder, and chest, is different from the

S ; individual action of either set, or of any individual muscle; or
J an instance nearer our purpose may be adduced, viz the ac-
5 tions of the muscles of the chest and belly, making a com-
S pression upon the viscera, as in the discharge of urine, feces,
IK &e. But to question this fact would be to question the influ-
I ence of the will in any one of the almost infinite variety of
5 motions in the human body.

= I presume, therefore, it will be admitted that we have the
= same-power over these muscles of the eye as of others, and I
'Z believe we are no less sensible of their combined action ; for
Z example, after viewing an object at the distance of halfa mile, if
= we direct our attention to an object but ten feet distance, every
Z person must be sensible of some exertion ; and if our atten-
= tion be continued but for a short time, a degree of uneasi-
& ness and even pain in the ball of the eye is experienced ;
65 if again we view an object within the focal distance, 7. e. within
