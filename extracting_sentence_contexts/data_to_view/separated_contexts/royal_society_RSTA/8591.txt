When the crystal thus suspended has come to rest, mark the
line along its end which stands awial. Let a knife edge be laid along this line and
pressed in a direction parallel to the axis of the prism. The crystal will yield before
the edge and discover a perfectly clean plane of cleavage.

â€œThese facts are suggestive. The crystals here experimented with are of the same
outward form; each has but one cleavage, and the position of this cleavage with
regard to the form of the erystal, is the same in all. The magnetic force, however,
at once discovers a difference of action.
