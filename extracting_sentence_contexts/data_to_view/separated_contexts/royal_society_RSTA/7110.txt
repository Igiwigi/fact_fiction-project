At 334° C, however,

g crackles are obtained after an induction period of about 15sec. (cf. dextrinated lead azide

a above), and this behaviour persists with rise of temperature (and consequently shorter

o

zg induction period), up to about 337° C,,where it changes over to real detonation. N othing analogous
to the ‘puff’ given by dextrinated azide is obtained here. This absence of deflagration by
E self-heating may be due to (a) different crystal size; (6) evolution of nitrogen by the crystals
A in sufficient quantity to allow the shock wave mechanism to operate; (c) absence of dextrin;
(d) the fact that the region of detonation of Service azide is higher than that of dextrinated
azide, and consequently nearer to the boiling point of nujol. If (d) above is the correct explanation, then a higher-boiling liquid should give a possibility
of deflagration by self-heating with Service azide. This is in fact found with tricresyl phosphate, which boils at 385°C.
