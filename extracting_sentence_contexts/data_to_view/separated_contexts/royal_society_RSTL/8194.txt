If the immediate progenitor of the Paridigitates presented the given arrangement
of the carpal and tarsal bones, then, at the gradual differentiation of this type, every
small change in one bone called forth a corresponding change in all its neighbours. And
as the link which connects all the forms together was never destroyed, and the changes
were slowly going on, we meet now, in the extremely differentiated descendants, a unity
of organization which was inevitable if all these forms descended from one common
progenitor. But if, leaving the point of view of evolutionists, we look at the matter on
the special-creation principle, this similarity of structure in animals s0 widely different
is really an awkward fact. To the supporters of special creation the question presents

and this to such an extent that even the seyen bones of the carpus and tarsus, notwith-
standing their irregular shape, were always arranged in the same way, 80 that a certain
facet of one bone always touched a certain particular facet, of another, and never other-
wise. That this could really occur in every separate case of creation, is almost as pro-
bable as that seven dice thrown out of a dice-box should give us the same number
of points, similarly arranged in a hundred successive throws.
