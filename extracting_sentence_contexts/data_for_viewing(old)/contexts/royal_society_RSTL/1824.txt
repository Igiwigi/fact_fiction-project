SIR CHARLES BELL ON THE ORGANS OF THE HUMAN VOICE. 311

In a person whom I had the pain of attending for a long time after the
bones of the upper part of the face were lost, and in whom I could look down
behind the palate, I saw the operation of the velum palati. During speech it
was in continual motion ; and when this person pronounced the explosive let-
ters, the yelum rose convex, 80 as to interrupt the ascent of the breath in that
direction; and as the lips parted, or the tongue separated from the teeth or
palate, the velum recoiled forcibly.

These facts lead us to the further contemplation of the pharynx. We ee it
to be a large cavity behind the palate, formed by a dilatable bag, and acted
on by many muscles. We have seen that the volume of sound issues into it
from the glottis below; and that although it opens into the nose above, yet
this passage is closed, whenever the velum is raised, like a valve, in the man-
ner just described ; at such a time, if the mouth be also shut, the bag will be
closed on all sides, and may then suffer distention by the vocalized breath
ascending through the glottis.

In speaking, much of the sound, as of the yowels and diphthongs, is the
uninterrupted issue of the yocalized breath, modulated by the passages, and
differently directed, but not checked or interrupted. The consonants are the
same sounds checked by the tongue, lips, or teeth. At the moment of this
