But in DD it is very slight, and in EE it has changed its type, the
character figures for the days subsequent to the crest being now a shade less than those
for the corresponding days preceding it. The fact that, in these five cases, the last three
of the character figures for days n + 3 and all the character figures for days n — 8 fall
below the normal is not really strange. We have collected in column » the outstanding
disturbed days of the month, and this tends to reduce below the normal the character
figures in all the other columns. ‘The mean character figures for days n — 1, n + 1 and
n -- 2 exceed the normal only because of the tendency for disturbed and quiet days to
occur in groups. ‘This fact has to be remembered, even in connection with the secondary
pulse. A selected D day has only 4 chances as against the 5 for the non-selected days of
contributing to the secondary pulse in its own month, and its chance of contributing is
further reduced when the selected D days occur in groups. But even in a 31-day month
only the first four days have the 27th subsequent day in the same month.
