numerous combinations which it forms with other bodies: But,
though in the present table of Equivalents, I have retained the
same unit, and have taken care to make oxygen equally-pro-
minent for the same reason as before, as well as' on account
of the important part it performs/in determining the affinities
of bodies by the different proportions in which it is united to
them ; nevertheless the real measure, by which most bodies
are compared to each other, in any experiments that'I have
made, and to which I have, in fact, endeavoured to find equi-
vaients, is a determinate quantity of carbonate of lime. This
is a compound, that may be: regarded as most distinctly neu-
tral. It is most easy to obtain in a state of uniform purity ;
most easy to analyse (as a binary. compound); it is a most
convenient measure for the powers of acids, and aftords the
most distinct expression for the comparative neutralizing
powers of alkalies.

The first question, consequently, to be resolved is, by what
number are we to express the relative weight of carbonic acid,
if oxygen be fixed at 10. It seems to be very well ascer-
tained, that a given quantity of oxygen yields exactly an equal
