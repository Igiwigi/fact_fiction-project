WIND

In §5-6 formulae were obtained for the angular deviation, yaw and rate of turn due to
the wind. In the derivation of these expressions it was assumed that the projectile was
perfectly launched. In actual fact part of the initial tip-off conditions will be due to the
action of the wind, but the contribution of these parts to the motion during burning is very
small and will be neglected. Accordingly, if w,(s) is the complex cross-wind (see (5-6-1),
we have, by (5-6-7, 8, 9),

6°81. The wind structure
We now assume a particular form for the wind gradient, namely

w,(s) = wy(sy) (1-+elog pI. (681-1)

This is similar to a form proposed by Sutton} (1936), namely,

where A is the height and the constant a is a function of the temperature lapse rate, of the
local topography, of hy and possibly of the wind speed w,(s)).
