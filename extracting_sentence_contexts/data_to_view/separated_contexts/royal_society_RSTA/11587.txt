Meaning of curl F = 0 and curl R= 0.
14. We now perceive the true meaning of the two equations (16) and (17), viz.,—

enrl (E — p VHu) = 0, curl (H + KVEu) = 0,

or, as we may now write them,
curl F = 0, curl BR = 0. They simply express the fact that the work done in taking a unit quantity of either
electricity or magnetism round any closed path is zero, the path itself moving forward
with the velocity u which is common to the whole system. This implies that F and
