type of atress. It by no means explains all the known facts. It does explain
satisfactorily such known mechanical actions of real conductors—conveying currents
and bearing charges—and magnets on one another as are of the nature of apparent
actions at a distance. It does not at all explain the many known mechanical actions
of one part of a conductor or magnet on another part which can be tested only by
observing the (small) strains resulting.
