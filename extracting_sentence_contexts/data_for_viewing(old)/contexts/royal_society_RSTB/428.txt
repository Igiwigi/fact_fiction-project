To the same category belongs the question of the action of anzesthetics upon the
neuro-muscular system, a question the importance of which for the present investiga-
tion can hardly be exaggerated ; since, for reasons which we will further discuss, the
effect attained by exciting any given centre may be entirely modified by the mere
degree of anzesthesia affecting the peripheral mechanism of nerve-endings and muscles.

In a previous communication* we have shown the importance of the action of ether
upon the peripheral nervous system, a factor which must be properly discounted in
considering the action of the anzesthetic upon the nervous mechanism as a whole.

‘hese considerations of species, age, and anzesthesia will compel us to further sub-
divide the great groups into which we have arranged our facts.

In the following historical retrospect of the results obtained by previous investiga~
tors we have thought it best (to avoid misconception) to place each writer in the
chronological order of the appearance of his publication.
