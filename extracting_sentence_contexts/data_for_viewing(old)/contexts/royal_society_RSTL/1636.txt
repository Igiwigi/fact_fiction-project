DEAR SIR,

As the method of making ice in this country, where the
thermometer, during part of the year, stands at from gz to
100‚Äù in the shade, has something peculiar in it, I trust the fol-
lowing description of the process will not be unacceptable.
You know that ice is made in India during the months of
December, January, and part of February ; but I believe it
has generally been considered as necessary to the congelation
of the water, that it should have been boiled. However, I can
now assure you, as a fact within my own observation for
these nine years past, that a large quantity of ice has been
made at this place every year, without any preparation
whatever; and I have often seen ice of an inch and
quarter thick, notwithstanding I do not conceive that the
atmosphere, at that time, was sufficiently cold to produce the
effect ; for I have frequently placed a thermometer, with the
naked bulb on the straw, amidst the freezing vessels during
the night, and'on inspecting it between five and six o'clock
in the morning (at which time the ice-makers informed me
the cold was most intense), I never found it below gz3*. 1
