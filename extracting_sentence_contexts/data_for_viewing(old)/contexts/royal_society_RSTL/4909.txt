radical by Buxszx was certainly one of the most important steps in the development.
of organic chemistry, and one, the influence of which upon our theoretical views of
the constitution of certain classes of organic compounds, can scarcely be too highly
estimated. It was impossible to consider the striking features in the behaviour of
this body, without finding in them a most remarkable confirmation of the theory of
organic radicals, as propounded by Berzerivs and LigBis.
The formation of cacodyl, its habits, and the products of its decomposition, have
for 8ome time left no doubt, of the existence of methyl ready formed in this body ; and
KoLBzX, in developing his views on the s0-called conjugate compounds, has proposed
to regard it as arsenic conjugated with two atoms of methyl ((C, H,),As). So long
Ys cacodyl was an isolated example of an organo-metallic body, this view of its
#Tational compoxition, harmonizing as it did s0 well with the facts elicited during the

oute of cacodyl through its various combinations and decompositions, could scarcely
He contested ; but now, since we have become acquainted with the properties and
Feactions of a considerable number of analogous bodies, circumstances arise, which I
Zonsider militate greatly against this view, if they do not render it absolutely
Hntenable. According to the theory of conjugate radicals just alluded to, cacodyl
