where Area ~ R? is the surface area of the object. Correspondingly, in d space-time dimensions
we have
Smax = Area - f-?, (1.4)

where Area ~ R4-?,
The second bound on entropy reads

Smax ==, (15)

a
where a denotes the (dimensionless) running coupling among the elementary constituents
evaluated at the scale R (for momentum-transfer 1/R). The two bounds are not independent.
In fact, for a self-sustained system (1.1), they are equivalent. For example, in d = 4 a self-sustained
state of N=1/a particles of wavelengths R breaks the Poincare symmetry spontaneously. The


decay constant of the corresponding Goldstone mode is given by (1.2). Taking into account (1.1),
the expressions (1.3), (1.6) and (1.5) are equal.

Notice that the Goldstone interaction strength at momentum-transfer 1/R is aÂ¢ojq = 1/(Area -
ft), Thus, in arbitrary dimensions, the bound (1.4) can also be written as
