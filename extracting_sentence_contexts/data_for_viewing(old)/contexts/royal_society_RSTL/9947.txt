land: it is obvious that the result is dependent on a great variety of cireumstances.
The nitrogen of the nitrate distributes much more rapidly through the s0il and subsoil.
The flora becomes greatly modified. Plants of different habits, both of aboveground
and underground growth, are developed. Accordingly, the roots obtain possession of
different ranges of soil and &ubsoil ; and according to their range, and to their func-
tional capability of food-collection, they gather up the more. With these favourable
80il-conditions, the plant takes up more from the atmosphere within a given time.
But, how far it does s0 simply as a result of a more favourable condition of the cell and
Sap, due to a more favourably balanced supply of nitrogenous and mineral food, in-
dueing greater activity of a given leaf-surface, or how far it is that,. conjointly with
greater vegetative activity, there 1s, as there necessarily must be, also a constantly
increasing above-ground surface, and hence a complex and cumulative action, is a
question beyond the scope of our observed facts to determine. That the increased
as8imilation of carbon over a given area cannot be entirely accounted for by the 8nppo-
sition that the particular species of plants developed have a greater assimilative power
for a given leaf-surface than those they have replaced, would appear from the fact that,
when a given amount of nitrogen, as nitrate of soda and ammonia-salts respectively, is
applied for one and the same description of crop—barley, for exumple—there is also
found a greater fixation of carbon—that is more growth over a given area—under the
influence of the nitrate.

11. 275 lbs. Nitrate of Soda, with Mixed Mineral Manure, containing Potass; Plot 16.

The next selection of results hows the effects of the mixed mineral manure with
only 275 1bs. of nitrate of soda per acre per annum ; that is, only half as much as was
