H. W. TURNBULL ON THE GEOMETRY OF MATRICES

D to S produces the space $5573, obtained in fact by retaining those parameters whose
suffixes are 0 or 1 only. Thus
Ajeg-* D> Syo678-
When such alternate reflexion in B and D is continued as before, we obtain the following
result:
Dye = Si6g> Aros S12678 > A 12678 > 5123678 > A 123678

~> Sto34678 > Ajoss67a > Sat > Aa (2)
Thereafter the sequence is stable. These terms are derived as in § 12 by adjoining a new
non-zero set 0,, 0’, ... at each double-arrow stage (i = 1, 2,...) until the parameters are
exhausted.
