thought to be a dyke (fig. 19, Plate 27). Microscopical examination reveals that it is
composed of angular quartz grains set in an isotropic ground mass which has the
appearance of a glass. This led me to believe that the “dyke” resulted from thrusting
movements which fused the surfaces and that it was in fact a pseudo-tachylyte. On
the other hand, several authorities to whom the specimens have been submitted are of
the opinion that it cannot be pseudo-tachylyte. In particular, they insist upon the
absence of crushing of the included fragments. The only alternative suggestion which
I can put forward for the formation of this peculiar rock is that if a plane of weakness
existed in the crest of the anticline, as is suggested by the small fracture observed at
more than one point, then an injection of magma may have taken place along that
plane. This would have afforded a lubricant to the surfaces of the fracture, and by
reason of the friable nature of the grits a certain amount of angular material may have
been incorporated in the molten rock. That some of the sedimentary material should
be fused and mixed with the invading magma is easy to imagine and might well
account for the unusually high refractive index of the existing glassy matrix.
