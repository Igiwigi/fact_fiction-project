more convenient to work with large numbers and risk the loss of a certain per-

labour was necessary to secure so many, they are so well protected by thick
membranes that the labour of collection is comparatively slight. The tissue of the
tumour was teased as finely as possible, and then moistened and rubbed lightly with
the finger in a mortar, until the pieces were reduced to about the size of coarse sand
grains. Sporangia separate from tissue more readily than cell from cell, and upon
this fact the following rubbing and filtering processes depend. By filtering through
muslin, the larger pieces of tissue were held back, and the filtrate, containing groups
of sporangia, was poured into a funnel covered with ordinary silk. This was then
spread on a flat dish, and the sporangia were again rubbed with the finger. By this
means nearly all the sporangia were rendered free, and the mesh of the silk was
sufficiently narrow to permit their passage on to the glass below, while the larger
fragments of tissue were held back. Sediment of the same size as the sporangia was
worked through with the latter, but most of it could be removed by centrifuging.
After this drastic treatment, groups containing two or three sporangia might still
remain, but fully 90 per cent. of the material consisted of isolated sporangia. No
attempt was made to keep the sporangia sterile, as comparative freedom from
bacteria was all that was required, and this was secured by repeated centrifuging in
fresh solutions.
