No mature spermatozoa were present in the vesicule seminales or vasa
deferentia. Although I have not had the opportunity of following the process of
spermatogenesis in any detail, an examination of thin sections, stained with iron-alum
hematoxylin, failed to reveal any indications of degeneration associated therewith. I am, therefore, led to the conclusion, which is supported by other facts, that the
testes of the soldier are functional organs. (b) The Winged Male.—In the fully chitinised winged male, the reproductive
system resembles that of the soldier so closely that any detailed description or figures
appear to be unnecessary. The testes are much enveloped in fat-body, and are con-
sequently rather difficult to detect ; on an average each testis measures 0°48-0°5 mm.
