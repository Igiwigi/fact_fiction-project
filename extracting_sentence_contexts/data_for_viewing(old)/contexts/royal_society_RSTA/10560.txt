It is therefore possible that, even when the nebula is non-rotating, the temperature-
lag may be sufficient to make the nebula unstable. If we disregard the temperature-
lag, it seems probable that a small rotation will suffice to bring about instability.
This latter question, however, deserves more detailed examination.

§ 35. Let us suppose that the nebula starts from rest in a configuration of absolute
equilibrium, and that the rotation is gradually increased. In this way we obtain a
linear series of configurations of relative equilibrium. When the rotation is small,
the configuration, instead of being strictly spherical is slightly spheroidal. The
series we are considering is therefore the analogue of the series of MAcLAURIN
spheroids of an incompressible fluid, So long as the rotation remains small, we may
separate the two terms of the rotation-potential in the manner explained in § 31.
We may, in fact, suppose our analysis still to apply as if the configuration remained
spherical, and the only effect of the rotation is to increase the value of the stability-
function, For larger values of o*, all our results are subject to a correction of the

order of w'. For small values of w°, the value of w? will be proportional as we have
seen (§ 31) to vu, — 1, so that this correction may be supposed to be proportional to
(w.— 1). The first points of bifurcation of orders 1, 2 occur (in the spherical
configuration) at u,— 1= 9, 2% respectively, where @ is known to be less than 4.
Now it would seem to be fairly safe to neglect 6°, but even if we waive this point, it
will be admitted that the correction of the order of (u.,— 1)* cannot be so great as to
