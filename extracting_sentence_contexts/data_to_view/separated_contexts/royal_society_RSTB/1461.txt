In the monkey the area excitation of which evoked adduction of the vocal cords
was at the lower extremity of the ascending frontal gyrus just behind the lower end
of the precentral sulcus. During epilepsy there was adduction in the tonic stage,
and sometimes a confusion between adduction and respiratory (?) abduction; in
the clonic stage the movement of adduction alone occurred in single spasms. Morr* states that in attempting to differentiate an abductor centre in the
cerebral cortex he discovered no new facts. He confirmed Krauseâ€™s observation
that after ablation of the adductor centre on both sides the animal is still able to
bark. He also confirmed the observation of Horsey and Semon that excitation of
the laryngeal centre on one side after extirpation of that on the other, results in
bilateral movements of the vocal cords.
