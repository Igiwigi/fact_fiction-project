mental current with regard to its direction through the organ, and with this view a
current passing through the tissue from the ventral to the dorsal surface was termed
“ homodromous,” since its direction was similar to that of the response, and a current
passing in the opposite direction was termed “ heterodromous.” A strong galvanic
current of short duration, whether ‘‘ homodromous,” or “ heterodromous,” is followed
by an electromotive change which shows itself galvanometrically as a current
passing through the organ in the direction of the shock. With weaker galvanic
currents or currents of long duration after-effects are produced which are opposed
in direction to the experimental current,

The influence of the organ upon the experimental current itself’ is very surprising,
for it would appear that the organ is a better conductor for ‘‘ homodromous” than it
is for “ heterodromous ” currents. This remarkable fact is not, according to pu Bors-
Reymonp, due to the development of an excitatory change which adds to the amount
of one current whilst it diminishes that of the one oppositely directed ; it can therefore
only be called, for want of intelligible physical explanation, a case of “ irreciprocal
conduction.”

He states further that both facts are of great teleological importance, since they show
that the shock of the organ, instead of being weakened by polarisation in the tissue,
will be strengthened by the production of an after-effect in the same direction as
itself, and that the organ is of such a character as to distinctly disfavour any short-
circuiting of the current present in one column by its neighbour. ‘To quote his own
words, “the organ is not insulated, but the irreciprocal conduction which we have
recognised performs, as has been already stated, a function similar to complete
