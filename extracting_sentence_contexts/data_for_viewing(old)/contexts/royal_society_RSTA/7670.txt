and at this stage we have extracted the factors w*/a$ from F9, v°/a3 from Y, and 08 /a8 from Sy;
no confusion should be caused by retaining the same symbols Fy, Y;, etc., for the reduced
expressions, which are now non-dimensional constant coefficients depending only on the
properties of the media. In future this procedure will be carried out automatically.

be even in ¢ since Y is odd and S even, so taking account of the fact that the loops I’, and

we find that the expressions for ,%? are identical for A() 20. Therefore, we have
