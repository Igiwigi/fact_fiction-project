stimulated into increased activity by these parasitic gemmules.t In any case this seems
a fair explanation of the fact that the protoplasm of the cell becomes exceptionally
frothy and vacuolated, and the cell itself enlarges quickly, coincidently with the
appearance and rapid increase of the tiny gemmules. At this time, also, vigorous
specimens have these cells abundantly supplied with starch at the period when the
above increase in size and coincident multiplication of gemmules occur (fig. 12). The
only explanation seems to be that the parasitic gemmules and hyphe are stimulating
the protoplasm to greater activity, and thus making the cell act as a centre of attrac-
tion for the plentiful supplies of carbo-hydrates sent down from the leaves, and other
substances coming up from the root-hairs.

Tracing the hyphz from the cortex into the young tubercle, then, and the changes
which go on in the cells of the latter, the following facts are to be noted. The single
stout hypha (fig. 94) first breaks up into numerous branches (figs. 8-12) which
distribute themselves in all the cells of the dividing mass of tissue—the incipient
tubercle. While the younger branches continue this process the older ones form the
short branches, and begin to bud off numerous tiny gemmules into the cell-contents
(figs. 12-17): the struggle between the protoplasm and these gemmules—which
themselves go on budding—is evinced by the frothing and activity of the protoplasm,
which thus comes to resemble a plasmodium, and by the accumulation of starch, and
perhaps other substances also. This causes the cells to grow (hypertrophy), and by
the time the hypertrophy has ceased the gemmules in that particular cell have ceased

* Frank was also inclined to the same view (‘Botan. Zeitung,’ 1879, p. 385), but he has since
retracted his opinions on the whole subject in a most unaccountable manner, See ‘ Berichte d. Deutschen
