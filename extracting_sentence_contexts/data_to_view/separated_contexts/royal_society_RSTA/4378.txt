Although the substitution of Zn in CdS increases the band gap
making fewer photons suitable for absorption, we see enhanced H2 evolution activity. This could
be due to the enhanced charge separation obtained by altering the band alignment by partial
substitution of Zn in CdS. This fact was also supported by room temperature photoluminescence
studies. Similar effect has also been observed with partial substitution of Se in CdS as in
ZnO/Pt/CdS;_xSey. On replacing NazS—Na2SO3 with benzyl! alcohol-acetic acid, ZnO/Pt/CdS
and ZnO/Pt/CdoZno25 exhibited nearly threefold improvement in activity yielding 31.6 and
