The Stockholm Conference of 1972 was a turning point in environmental science. There
is little doubt that long-range transport and effects of pollutants had been taking place for

decades; in fact, many had noted the inter-country transport of pollutants in Europe (e.g. [60]). It was only following Oden’s analysis that international scientific and political attention was
drawn to the subject and monitoring and process studies demonstrated the scale and ecological
significance. The initial reaction of the major polluting countries in Europe was mixed.
