tudes less air breathed, reduced to 0Â° and 760 mm., than at the sea level, is required to
produce 1 grm, of carbonic acid in the body. The experiments on the Peak of Tenerife,
by doing away entirely with the influence of cold, placed this fact beyond doubt.

As it is important towards a clear understanding of this paper that the results
obtained formerly should be present to the reader, I beg to subjoin them in a tabular
form.
