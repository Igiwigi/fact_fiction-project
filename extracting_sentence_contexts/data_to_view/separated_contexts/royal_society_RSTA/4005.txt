Experiments similar to those just described were also made on specimens of zinc,
with the result that specimens of zine strained by compression at ordinary tempera-
tures were found to re-crystallise on exposure to 200°C. Some results obtained with
sheet-zine, such as that used for electric batteries, were particularly interesting. It
is a well known fact that the mechanical properties of zinc are widely different at
different temperatures, particularly that the metal is soft and ductile at temperatures
slightly above 100° C., and that it is generally worked at that temperature, while it

is known to become very brittle at and above 200° C. Commercial sheet-zinc, rolled
at temperatures above 100° C., remains fairly soft and flexible at ordinary tempera-
tures, and its crystalline structure is too minute to be seen in specimens etched with-
out previous polishing. 294 PROFESSOR J. A. EWING AND MR. W. ROSENHAIN If a specimen of such sheet-zine be exposed to a temperature of 200° C. for about
half-an-hour, it shows on etching with strong hydrochloric acid a brilliantly crystalline
texture as illustrated in fig.
