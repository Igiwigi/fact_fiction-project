Allowance must also be made for the effects of the blast which rushed out from the
valleys of the Wallibu and Wallibu Dry Rivers. It was strong enough to blow down
many of the trees on the ridge above Wallibu, and must have raised the sea in
powerful waves. Captain Freeman, of the “Roddam,” states that in St. Pierre
harbour the waves occasioned by the blast were tempestuous.* But here the wind
was off the shore, and may have really produced very little effect.

There is, however, a certain amount of evidence which points to the conclusion that
the inner boundary of this depressed tract may be a fault line. . It certainly has a
very straight trend, and, looking at it on the map, one is at once struck with this
peculiarity. In this respect it differs entirely from the smaller subsidences at the
mouths of the streams at Larikai and Trois Loups. Another fact of great interest
is the rapidity with which the water deepens off the new shore. Mr. P. Fosrrr
Huaaers,t of Chateaubelair, found that at 50 feet from the beach the depth is
74 fathoms, at 100 feet 18 fathoms, a submarine slope of 45°. This is a gradient
much higher than is usual along this side of the island, and may be due to the
presence of a fracture, on the seaward side of which there has been depression.

Formerly, this coast was known as Hot Waters, because the water obtained by
digging pits in the sand was warm, This may indicate the existence of a fissure up
which hot water rose, but all the inhabitants of the villages on the beach whom we
