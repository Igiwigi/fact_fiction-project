necessary work of comparison and interpretation, and we willingly undertake this duty.
Each of us has independently studied the actual fossil skull in the Union Medical College
at Peiping and examined the beautiful cast made by Professor Davrpson Biack from
the actual fossils, and we should like to express our gratitude to him for these oppor-
tunities and many other kindnesses which he showed us.

In studying the endocranial cast obtained from the Piltdown skull one of us (G. E. S.),
years ago, was impressed by the extraordinary resemblance presented by the form of
the brain in this extinct member of the human family to that of the primitive brain
of a modern human being, a Sudanese negress (ExLior Smiru, 1927, figs. 40 and 41).
The other (J. L. S.) was impressed by the remarkable likeness to the endocranial cast
of Sinanthropus of the brain of the Bushwoman, described in 1865 by Professor Joun
Marsuauti. The recognition of these facts adds particular importance to the con-
sideration that both the authors of this communication have served an apprenticeship
to the task by examining large series of primitive brains, aboriginal Australians (J. L. S.)
and Sudanese negroes (G. H.8.), and have devoted some attention to the comparison
of the brains of the anthropoid apes and primitive men. In attempting to interpret
the significance of the endocranial cast of Sinanthropus special attention must obviously
be paid to comparison with the casts of Pithecanthropus and Eoanthropus. The com-
parison with the brains of the larger apes is also important, throwing light as it does
upon the characters one ought to expect to find in extremely primitive human brains.

In attempting to convey some real conception of the nature of the form of the brain
we have resorted to the use of series of contours, figs. 10-14, so that the reader at a
glance can obtain a graphic expression of the distinctive peculiarities of form.
