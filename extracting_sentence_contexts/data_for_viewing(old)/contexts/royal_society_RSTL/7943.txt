2 31. It may be remarked, as regards the cases which follow, that although the result in
5 terms of (3, z, ;, 7) when once known can be explained and verified easily enough, there
A is great risk of oversight if we endeayour to find it in the first instance ; while on the
other hand the transformation from the form in terms of (&, X, £), as given by the prin-
ciple of correspondence, to the required form in terms of (3, x, 4, 7) is by no means easy.
I in fact first obtained the expression in (x, X, £), and then, knowing in some measure
the form of the other expression, was able to find it by the actual transformation of the
expression in (a, X, £).
