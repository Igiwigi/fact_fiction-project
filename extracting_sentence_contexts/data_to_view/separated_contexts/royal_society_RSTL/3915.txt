If the muscular induction not
only acts upon the nerve in contact with the muscle but also through some inter-
posed bodies, it is natural to admit that when a muscular mass enters into contrac-
tion by the irritation acting on one of its nerves, the phenomenon of induction should
occurin all the other nerves. And even wishing to yield for a moment to the analogies
that exist between the electric current and the neryous force, we might be led to be-
lieve that this induction should take place upon the excited nerve which is the cause
of the contraction. Could we not perhaps from this deduce a physical explanation
of a well-established physiological fact, that within certain limits the activity of the
muscles increases in proportion as the contraction is aroused in them ? It also appears to me that a great number of those moyements which occur in us
and in animals independently of the will, but yet following others occasioned by the
will, may be considered as phenomena of muscular induction. I leave to physiolo-
gists the continuation of these studies, which appear to me worthy of all their in-
terest.
