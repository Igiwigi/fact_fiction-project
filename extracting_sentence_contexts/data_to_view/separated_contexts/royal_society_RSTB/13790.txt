Early mammals lost sensitivity innovations, early mammals effectively shifted much of the
to medium wavelength light [47], becoming effectively red- control of behaviour from the visuomotor midbrain to the
green colour-blind [136], and they reduced the size of their somatomotor forebrain, setting the stage for a diversification
optic tectum (in mammals called the superior colliculus) of their behavioural repertoire.

along with its collothalamic targets in the VPall, LPall and stria- Inall mammals, cerebral cortical organization can be under-

auditory and somatosensory systems [95]. In fact, most of the layer ‘eulaminate’ cortex [74,83,150-154], as shown in figure 6.
