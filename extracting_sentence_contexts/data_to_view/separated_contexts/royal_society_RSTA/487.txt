Caulton and co-workers have reported
that 16-electron Ru(CO))(P'Bu2Me)2 adds Hp, Clz or O2 to give the corresponding 18-electron
complexes cis,cis,trans-Ru(H) (CO) (P'Bu2Me)), cis,cis,trans-Ru(Cl)2(CO)(P'Bu2Me), and Ru(n?-
O>)(CO)2(P'BuyMe)z, respectively. Interestingly, reaction with HSiMe3 gave the dihydride
Ru(H)2(CO)2(P'Bu2Me)2 dissolved in liquid Me3SiSiMe3, formed by a dehydrocoupling process. Reaction with CO is particularly slow, and this is postulated to be due to the fact that
the product, Ru(CO)3(P'Bu2Me)2, is a similar size to the organometallic reactant, and this
results in surface passivation rather than the fracturing of the crystal (and concomitant
faster ingress of gas) that is suggested to occur when product and starting material
geometries are different [38]. The electronically and coordinatively unsaturated complex
