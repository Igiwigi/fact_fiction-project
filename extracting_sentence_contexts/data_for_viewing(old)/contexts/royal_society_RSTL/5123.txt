true, and the extent to which this is done is easily seen, by fixing a small magnetic
needle, about 0-1 or 0-05 of an inch in length, across the middle of a piece of
stretched thread as an axis, and then bringing it into the magnetic field and near
the edges of the stationary disc. The lines of force will be seen (3071. 3076.)

magnetic body (2807.). Elsewhere, the lines of force go with the s8ame direction
across the magnetic field where the iron is, as where it is not; and it is to me a
proved fact, proved by the numerous results given, that a section of the lines of force
taken across the magnetic field through the air, where there is no iron, is exactly
equal in amount of force to a section taken across parallel to and through the iron disc
(3163.). All iron under induction must bave just as much force, 5. e. lines of force
in its internal parts, as is equivalent to the lines which fall on to, and are continued
through and out of it; and the same is true, as it appears to me, of any other para-
magnetic or diamagnetic substance whatever. The same is true for the magnet itself';
for a section through the magnet has been shown to be exactly equal to a section
anywhere through the outer lines of force (3121.), and these sections may be taken
at the surface of the magnet, where they may be considered as either in the air or in
the magnet indifferently; and therefore alike in size, shape, power, polarity, and
every other point.
