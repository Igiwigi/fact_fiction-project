The difficulty as thus
stated is equivalent to that above mentioned. Principal ForBres meets it as follows :â€”
* But we know in point of fact that a glacier is a body very differently constituted. It
is clearly proved by the experiments of AGass1z and others, that a glacier is not a mass
of ice, but of ice and water, the latter percolating freely through the crevices of the
former to all depths of the glacier; and as it is a matter of ocular demonstration that
these crevices, though very minute, communicate freely with one another to great
distances, the water with which they are filled communicates force also to great distances,
and exercises a tremendous hydrostatic pressure to move onwards, in the direction in
which gravity urges it, the vast porous crackling mass of seemingly rigid ice in which it
is, as it were, bound up. *
