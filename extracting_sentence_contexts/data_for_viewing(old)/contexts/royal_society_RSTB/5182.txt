are not mere incidental effects.

The simplest and most effective way to render the iris opaque to light would be by
the deposition of black pigment, which one finds deposited all over the posterior layers
of the iris and ciliary body in all, or certainly very nearly all, animals. But the metallic
and other striking colours are deposited over the outer and visible layers. Whether
these brilliant and beautiful colours are there for the purpose of attracting the opposite
sex, as is certainly the case in many species of Birds, is an open question; but, as we
can assign no other reason at present, we are justified, I think, in provisionally
assuming this to be the cause. In the case of Fishes the problem becomes still more
complicated, for, as Huss has repeatedly pointed out, fish appear to be colour-blind,*

notwithstanding the fact that all fly-fishermen stoutly maintain the contrary. (See
Section 8 on this point.)

It has been suggested that the pigmentary colours of the iris might form a selection
filter to the various colours of light. I therefore made some tentative experiments

1909. Hxss points out, however, that fishes are sensitive to the ultra-violet rays, and become visibly

fluorescent. See also as regards this point his paper “ Untersuch, u. den Lichtsinn bei Rept. u. Amphi-
bien,” ‘ Arch. f, d. ges, Physiologie,’ vol. 132 (1910). .
