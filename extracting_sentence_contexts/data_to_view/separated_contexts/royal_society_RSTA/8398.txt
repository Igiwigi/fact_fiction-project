This integral can be evaluated, and the main difficulty at this point is the per-
sistent factor e-” on the left, which is not an even function. If it were, a solution could
be written down by inspection. In actual fact, a somewhat long investigation is neces-
sary in order to get rid of this exponential, for, in the only mode of solution we have
found, the value of the integral on the left is indicated explicitly. One of our earlier formule was

[ a Jons3 (2 = a)? 40(0)

in the present notation—the proof was valid for complex values of q with a positive
real part. Accordingly,

—evidently in all circumstances an even function of « and an odd function of q, for
Yen (q) is odd in g.
