In particular, when the nematic liquid
crystals are doped with azo-dyes, their nonlinear response to opto-electrical stimulus is increased
by several orders of magnitude [13-15]. The dyes undergo a photoisomerization transition [12],
namely, molecular conformational changes are generated by the light, leading to local changes
of molecular interactions. As a matter of fact, photoisomerization facilitates orderâ€”disorder
transitions [16]. Indeed, photoisomerization induced fronts have been recently reported for a
dye-doped nematic planar layer [17]. The aim of this manuscript is to investigate the spatio-temporal phenomena induced by
photoisomerization in a nematic dye-doped liquid crystal (DDLC) layer when is illuminated in
the absorption band of the dopants.
