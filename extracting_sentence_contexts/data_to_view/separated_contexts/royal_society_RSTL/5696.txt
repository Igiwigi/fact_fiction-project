Since this paper was read, I was told by a gentleman well known in the scientific world, that he had
Eobeorved, many years ago, that if blood was shed upon a plate of glass previously heated to the temperature
Eof 100? Far., the red corpuscles showed no disposition to aggregation till the glass cooled, when the blood
Dbecame killed, as he supposed, by the unnaturally low temperature. This appeared to me entirely irrecon-
Eciteablo with the fact, that in the frog the red corpuscles aggregate immediately after the blood has been
<xhed, although there is no material difference between the temperature of the air and that of the body of
Stho animal. But, if true, it would have important bearings, to which Ineed not here allude, upon the essen-
Atial nature of inflammation. T have therefore thought it well to make some experiments upon the point.
