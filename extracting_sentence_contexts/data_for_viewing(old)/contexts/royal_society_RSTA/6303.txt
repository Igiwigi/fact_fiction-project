We will integrate (using MATHEMATICA) the pseudo-momentum —(0/d#)(t/ju;,¢) ina multi-
scale contour from radius ¢” to per unit thickness in the y-direction (figure 1)

which is due to the fact that the dislocation is 1/r singular at the core. It may be noted that the
same result is obtained for transition between scales (e"~!, e", n > 2); if it is across multiple orders
then the effective mass is increased accordingly.

It can be shown by calculation that the value of change of pseudo-momentum in the volume
obtained in equation (2.6) agrees with the flux of the pseudo-momentum through the surface of
the contour in figure 1, consistent with the conservation equation (2.3), as the contour does not
contain a singularity.

We note that contribution to equation (2.6) is only due to the terms in equations (2.5b) and
(2.5c), not (2.52).

Thus, the coefficient of the acceleration can be defined as the effective mass of a dislocation,
