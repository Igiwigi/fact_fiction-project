This creates a fundamentally
new credit assignment problem: which value and/or
future action should be assigned to which property of
the real or imagined world given the outcome of a
single act? If the causes of the actions of other agents
are hidden, so are their outcomes and valuation, i.e. a
social world by necessity operates on norms that are
hidden. Indeed, this fact has led to the hypothesis that
the human mind is specialized in norm extraction
[146]. Hence, in order to optimize real world action
the agent is forced to appraise performance with res-
pect to a singular interpretation of the mixed reality
probabilistic states that have given rise to its actions. Consciousness serves intentional valuation and norm
extraction.
