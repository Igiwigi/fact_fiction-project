considerations, the idea of suns or stars being merely:the 8up-
porters of systems of planets, is not. absolutely to be admitted
as a general one. Among the great-number of very compressed
clusters of stars, I have given in my» catalogues,-there are some
which open a different, view-of the heavens to us. The stars
in them /are-.80 very! close- together,” that; |notwithstanding
the great distance at which! we may-suppose :the cluster itself
to be, it will-hardly be possible to assign any 8ufficient mutual
distance to the» stars composing|the.cluster,-to leave room for
crowding in those planets, for-whose support these-stars-haye
been;-or might (be, supposed to! exist. ; It Should scemy there-
fore, highly probable; that they; exist for themselves ;\.and are,
in fact, only very capital, lucid, primary planets, connected to-
gether-in one great systein-of mutual gupport:://

As ih this argument I do not proceed upon conjectures, but
have actual observations in view, I shall wention an instance in

"the clusters, No. 26, 28, and 35» VI: class, of my catalogue of

nebulz, and clusters of stars.” (See Phil; Trans. Vol. LXXIX.
Part II. p. 251.) The stars in them are s0 crowded, that I
cannot conjecture them to be at a greater-apparent distance
from each other than five;seconds ; even after a proper allow-
ance for such stars, as on a suppoxition of a globular form of
