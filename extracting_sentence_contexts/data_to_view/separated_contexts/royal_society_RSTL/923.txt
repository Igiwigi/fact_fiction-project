cannot doubt that in crystallization the smallest masses assume
the-same form with the largest: but then other hypotheses
may perhaps also account for the fact, such as atmospheres,
electric fluid, &c. &c.; $0 that till farther observations are made
we ought to rest contented with barely suggesting the query. In the mean time, reserving to a future opportunity 'some in-
quiries concerning the chemical properties of light, and the
nature' of the forces which bodies exert on it internally, I con-
clude at present with a short summary of propositions. But
first, may TI be permitted to express a hope, that what-has been
already attempted (and for which no praise can be claimed far-
ther than what is due to attentive observation, according to the
rules of the immortal Bacon), may prove acceptable to such
