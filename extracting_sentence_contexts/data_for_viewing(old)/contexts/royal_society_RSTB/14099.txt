We should invest in network prediction because the right S

conditions to do so reliably and rapidly are beginning to
emerge. Given the possible benefits to a variety of ecological
disciplines that would result from an increased ability to pre-
dict networks, we feel strongly that the research agenda we
outline here should be picked up by the community.
