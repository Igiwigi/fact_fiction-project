(a) Geographical distribution

Compared with other human herpesviruses, which, with the
exception of HSV-2, characteristically infect the majority of
healthy individuals in most geographical regions, KSHV

Given this coevolution of KSHV with human populations,
the fact that it is today infrequent in many geographical areas
still awaits a satisfactory explanation. Suggestions include host
genetic polymorphisms that contribute to the maintenance of
KSHV in endemic populations. In support of this possibility,
the existence of a recessive gene on chromosome 3p22 predispos-

In the general population, KSHV appears to be transmitted has been predicted [65,66].
