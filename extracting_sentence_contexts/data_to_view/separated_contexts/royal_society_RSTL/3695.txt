And I proposed, by combining the observations of each
group, to find the times of high water and of low water much more accurately than
by the rude observation of the highest or the lowest water. But in discussing the
low-water observations, I found an unexpected difficulty, The rise of the water at a
given interval after low water (in half an hour, for instance) is considerably more
rapid than its descent at the same interval before low water. There is in fact the ru-
diment of a veritable hore. It is impossible here to use any observations for deter-
mining the time of low water except those which are very near to the low water. My curiosity was now excited to learn with a little more precision the laws of the
rise and fall of the water generally.
