§ 5. Reduction of Longitudes of Moon and Sun to time of Fictitious Transit. We have seen in (22) that the interval, from fictitious moon’s transit to the
time ¢, is

pa Ath ;
2(y—2)

Now the equation of conservation of areas for the moon’s motion gives
rl = oc? WAC ro e*),

but since c'/r§ = 1 + P, and since P is small, we have

j=o(1+ 3), very nearly,
Therefore

or cs (1 + =)
