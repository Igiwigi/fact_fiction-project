may be considered to be built up of similar sections each of length equal to about 34 AU.
which is a little larger than the spacing, 3-32 ALU., found in 6-hair. In view of the fact
that a spacing does not necessarily equal a chief intra-molecular distance, it is possible
that the spacing, 3-32 A.U., may be evidence of the existence of peptide chain in $-hair.
Meyer and Mark* have already put forward this simple arrangement as the structural
basis of silk fibroin, in spite of the fact that silk, though free from sulphur, from certain
points of view may be classed as a keratin (loc. cit.).

The Contents of the Unit Cell.—From the evidence as yet available, we cannot fix the
dimensions of the unit cell of either «- or $-hair with any degree of finality. We may
only suggest those of a cell which represents to a first degree of approximation the
repeating characteristics of the structure without actually being the strict unit of pattern.
Such a cell, in the low-tension form of hair, appears to be defined by a length of 5-15 AU.
along the fibre axis, and two lengths of 27 A.U. and 9-8 A.U. at right angles to the
fibre axis and to each other. There is not the least doubt that the true minimum unit of
pattern is greater than these magnitudes imply; still, the smaller unit is repeated
approximately within the larger and must be the expression of some chemical grouping
which is the structural basis of the completed protein molecule. Similarly, in the 6-form,
