S Owing to the fact that in Plewrotomaria the supporting “ rods” lie in the edges of
he leaflets nearest the supporting membrane of the axis, Woopwarpt (p. 225) has
Zooen a grave difficulty in the way of homologising the ctenidia of the Lamellibranchia
“Awith those of the Gastropoda. But the strengthened edges of the leaflets are still
Bowarda the efferent side of the axis, and all that is necessary for a rational explana-
Stion of the facts is to allow that the concrescence of the gill axis with the body is
“hecondar ry, and that if the gill is backwardly directed, as in Nuculu, that side of the
pate which carries the afferent vessel may become concrescent with the side of the
Body, whereas if the gill is forwardly rotated over the back, and has a further trans-
Slation from right side to left, and vice versd, as in Streptoneurous Gastropods, the
Sconcrescence is effected between the body and that side of the gill axis carrying the
Seiten’ vessel. This admission as to the concrescence being secondary appears to be
‘glegitimate, i in spite of the fact that Drew has shown that the gill leaflets of Nucula
‘arise as papillee from the sides of the body, and not from the sides of an axis which
Qsubsequently becomes concrescent with the body.

A very keen controversy has long been rife concerning the cells which are found on
the inner surface of the chitinous tube, and the warmth of the discussion appears to

* This is on the authority of Petsenrer (71, p. 164), and Sremrect (96, pp. 395 and 396).
Mitsukuri, KetLoca and MénéiGAux furnish no information. Drew, on the other hand, says that the
vessel nearest the body communicates with the auricle (22, p. 360).
