The fact that there are two very large nerve cells in the central nervous system of
the squid, Loligo, was discovered by Williams (1909), who also gave a brief description
of their connexions. His account appears never to have been amplified, or indeed even
mentioned, by any subsequent worker until these enormous nerve fibres were ac-
cidentally rediscovered in 1933 (see Young 19354, 19364, b, c). Williams considered

that the whole giant-fibre system on each side of the body consists of the processes
of one of the two main giant cells. In fact the arrangement is much more complicated
than this, and contains two curiously opposite features of the greatest interest for the
neurologist (Young 19366). First, the processes of the two main giant cells provide
a clear case of the complete fusion of the axons of two nerve cells, thus infringing the
strict canon of the neuron theory. Nevertheless, and this is the second point, there
are also present, elsewhere in the system, discontinuous synapses which are perhaps
more clear and easy to study than any yet described.

Investigation of the structure and functioning of these axons and synapses therefore
throws considerable light on the fundamental problems of nerve physiology, and it is
from this point of view that the present investigation of the anatomy and cytology of
the system has been undertaken. The optical, physical and chemical properties of the
axons have been described elsewhere (Young 19354, 1936Â¢, 1937; Bear, Schmitt and
