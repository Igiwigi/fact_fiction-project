When all diffraction colours disappear, and. the fog appears white from all points of
view, as it does when v,/v, amounts to about 1°44, we cannot be far wrong in assuming
that the diameter of the drops does not exceed one wave-length in the brightest part
of the spectrum, that is, about 5 x 107 centim. That the absence of colour is not
due to the inequality of the drops is evident from the fact that the colours are at
their brightest when »,/v, is only slightly less than 1°44, and from the perfect regu-
larity of the colour changes up to this point. Taking the diameter of the drops as 5 X 107° cub. centim., we obtain for the
volume of each drop about 6 x 107 cub.
