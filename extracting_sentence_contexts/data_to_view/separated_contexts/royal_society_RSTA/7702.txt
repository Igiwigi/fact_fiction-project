placements of the Q 1 line should be equal, fig. 3. and finally, there is a lack of the
similarity one would expect between the P’- and R’-lines. A few other features may be noted :—

(1) The very large number of small displacements to the blue which occur in
the system 3d *A — 2p *II is remarkable, and suggests that the perturbation is almost
purely electronic, and occurs in the initial level 3d #A.

(2) The first examination of the plates revealed the surprising fact that the
strong lines vv 15688-81 (5), 17935-73 (6), and 18115-94 (8) are entirely missing,
and the line v 15859-86 (5) is unexpectedly weak. These lines were later found
respectively to be 3p°II — 2s8> 3’ — 3” P’2, 3’ — 9" p’ 2, 3’ — 2” R’0 and
3’ — 3 R’ 0: ie. they all come from the same initial level 31 »’ = 3K = 1.

(3) The lines of only a few band branches resemble one another. Examples are
the Q-lines of 2’ — 2” 3p 311 — 25% and the P- and R-lines of (— 23S)” — 1”.
