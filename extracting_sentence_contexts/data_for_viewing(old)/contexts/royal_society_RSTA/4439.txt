and electricity (1%). Globally, however, the percentages of world energy uses in 2030 are expected
to be as follows:


renewables 6.3

nuclear 6.0
hydroelectric 6.8
coal 27.7
natural gas 25.9
oil 27.2

In addition to these statistics, there are other relevant facts contained in the Technology Roadmap:
Energy and Greenhouse Gases Reductions in the Chemical Industry via Catalytic Processes? This
report points out that the manufacture of 18 products (among thousands) from the chemical
industry account for 80% of energy demand in the chemical industry and 75% of greenhouse gas
emissions. A key finding in this report is that improvements in catalytic and related processes
could reduce energy intensity for these 18 products by 20-40% as a whole by 2050.

We note that ethylene and propylene—their global production in 2012 was 220 million
tonnes—are massive and vitally important products of the chemical industry. But, they are
currently generated, non-catalytically, by ‘steam cracking’ of naphtha.

Recent work, using microporous SSHCs such as those depicted in (see fig. 4.15 in [60]),
offers possible solutions. As, methanol, which (as stated in Part I) is also massively produced,
