of sixteen feet of thick platinum wire and fuse titanium into a solid mass, effects
never, I believe, before obtained by the voltaic battery.

A one thousand series of Zamoxr's piles is sufficient to elicit a distinct spark to
the measured space of zyths of an inch; yet these different results are at once as-
sumed as being due to what is usually denominated quantity and intensity.

It has been often urged that any objection which may have arisen as to the jden-
tity of electricity and galvanism, was at once removed by the fact of a spark of the
latter being capable of passing through space, or what is usually denominated the
striking distance; and it argues little for the correctness of our experimental investi-
gations, that such an important fact, (although perhaps until it is more satisfactorily
proved it can scarcely be assumed as a fact,) one apparently s0 easy of confirmation,
Sshould rest on one or two doubtful and isolated experiments. Although I must con-
sider that Professor DaxigLL laboured under some error when he describes the dis-
charge passing in the form of a spark (8.) when the cells were approximated, yet I
cannot but feel that it will be with the aid, and through the principles of this philo-
sopher's scientific apparatus, which he has so appropriately denominated the constant
battery, that the true principles of voltaic action will be correctly ascertained. There
is already one fact which was obtained with the 160 pairs (10.) which cannot, I be-
lieve, be satisfactorily accounted for by any of the existing theories. TI allude to the
remarkable heating of the positive electrode two inches beyond the part where the
circuit was completed*,

Before I conclude, I should wish it to be distinctly understood that I offer no opinion
