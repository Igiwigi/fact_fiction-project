condition in the Ferns may throw light upon the morphology of the ovuliferous scale
in Conifers. Those cases among Conifers in which the scale supply appears to
originate partly or entirely in the trace of the subtending bract are analogous to the
condition in the Hymenophyllaceze and numerous other Ferns, in which the branch
(whether adaxial or abaxial to the associated leaf) may be adnate to the petiolar base
for a variable distance. In such cases it is entirely out of the question to regard the
branch as an outgrowth of the leaf. As pointed out elsewhere (Saunt, 1917, p. 19),
the basal undivided portion of the vascular supply must be regarded as having a dual
nature, partly axial, partly foliar. SrrasBuRGER (1872, p. 69) has also drawn
attention to somewhat similar analogies among Angiosperms, of which the adnate
inflorescence of Tilia affords the most familiar instance.

The fact that the supply to the ovuliferous scale appears to arise from the supply
to the bract, therefore, does not necessarily indicate that the one organ is morpho-
logically an exerescence of the other.

(b) Degree of Development of the Ovuliferous Scale as an Index of Affinities.â€”
Considerable importance has been attached by several authors to the degree of
development of the ovuliferous scale as an index of affinity or of relative antiquity.
While the exponents of the ligular theory have naturally interpreted the poorly
developed ovuliferous scale of Araucaria and Agathis as signifying primitiveness,
Prof, Jerrrey and his pupils, who believe in the brachyblast theory and in the
Abietineous origin of the Conifers, have made use of the fact that in Pinus and allied
genera the ovuliferous scale (in the middle region of the cone) appears more nearly to
resemble an axillary shoot than it does in Araucaria. Finally, against those who
