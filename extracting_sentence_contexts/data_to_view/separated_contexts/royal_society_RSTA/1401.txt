In other words, considering WEs may be interpreted as a ‘Lagrangian’
approach, of time varying (here hourly) localized rainfall. This may complement the classical
‘Eulerian’ approach considering both the spatial and temporal variability of daily or subdaily
rainfall, including their extremes. In fact, characteristics of the WEs are not fully independent of
spatial location, since orography, distance from the coast, and orientation of the slopes versus
moisture flow will significantly impact on their duration as well as the occurrence of daily and
subdaily extremes. We however hypothesize from figure 5 that the six canonical WEs are likely
to cover a distinctive and robust set of different ‘Lagrangian’ archetypal WEs, which are likely to
hold across broader regions at least in the tropical zone. The dynamical interpretation of the CanWEs may be based on their temporal profiles (mostly
figures 4 and 6 here), their seasonality (figure 7) as well as their spatial extent inferred from
IMERG (figures 8 and 9).
