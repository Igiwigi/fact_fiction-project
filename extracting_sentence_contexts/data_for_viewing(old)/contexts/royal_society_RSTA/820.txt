bars. These rate coefficients appear to be consistent with reaction (1.1) proceeding with nearly
every collision between the species. This is indeed the case in the QCT calculations, where
the capture rate, defined as the rate for entering the ion—molecule well, is essentially the same
as the overall reaction rate. In fact, the SIFT rate coefficients reported here are slightly larger
than the parametrized collision rate by Su & Chesnavich [4], which takes into account only the
polarizability and permanent dipole moment of the neutral species.

Despite the fact that our PES has the same long-range terms as in Wei et al. [10], our calculated
rate coefficients are much larger than the earlier QCT results. The difference can thus be attributed
to the different level of the ab initio theory. The current CCSD(T)-F12b method is considered as the
gold standard in ab initio calculations because it captures electron correlation due to high-order
excitations that are necessary for describing the dispersion interactions. While such interactions
are at shorter range than the ion-dipole interaction, they might still affect the reactivity at large
impact parameters. To illustrate this point, we plot in figure 5 the minimal energy path including
the centrifugal potential Jtot(Jtot + 1)/2R?, where jz is the reduced mass of reactants and R is
