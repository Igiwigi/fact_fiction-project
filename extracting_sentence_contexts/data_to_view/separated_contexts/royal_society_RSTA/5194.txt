Generally, there is better
agreement with the NLS solutions with smaller wave steepness and smaller nonlinearity [46]. We can see that the maximal experimental values for the surface elevations are indeed a slightly
higher than the ones predicted in theory. Again, this is due to the fact that the surface elevation
described in terms of NLS solution on finite background can be considered as a free surface

Figure 3. (a) Evolution of a KM soliton for p = 1.0, a = 0.5 cmand ¢ = 0.08. The nine blue curves are measured by the set of
equidistantly separated gauges. The soliton position in time shifts relative to the position at the previous gauge. (b) Comparison
of the wave profile with maximum amplitude, measured 9m from the wave maker (blue top curve), with the predicted

theoretical second-order Stokes wave profile (red bottom curve), evaluated at the point of maximum soliton amplitude. (Online
