and this makes it very easy to determine whether the line AB is horizontal or not.
For when these knobs are sharply in focus at the same time AB must be at right
angles to the axis of the microscope.

452 MR. W. E. AGAR: EXPERIMENTS ON INHERITANCE IN PARTHENOGENESIS.

(2) Length of Antenna.—This measurement presented some troublesome features,
I was unable to measure the antenne directly, as WARREN found possible for
Hyalopterus, owing to the fact that they have a curvature both in the horizontal and
vertical planes. The vertical curve was flattened out by dissecting off the head, with
the antennz attached, and placing it ona flat slide and covering with a cover-slip, The
weight of this was sufficient to flatten out the antenna without crushing it. The
curvature in the horizontal plane still prevented direct measurement, so the antenna
was now drawn under the camera lucida, and the curved line so obtained measured
with an ordinary map measurer. The unit of measurement worked out at 0°02 mm.

Finding that greater accuracy could be obtained by omitting the first two segments,
I did this, and by “antennar length” must be understood throughout, the total
length without these two joints (see fig. 2).

252 specimens in all were preserved during the course of the experiment, but four of
