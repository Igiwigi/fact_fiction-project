With a high percentage of nickel and comparatively low carbon content, specimens
1287L, 3450, and 5277, the ratio of increase in tenacity in liquid hydrogen is only
moderate, but here we have to deal with a rather different type of steel from the lesser
alloyed steels hitherto considered. These are of the austenitic type with a face-centred
cubic atomic structure, while the lower-alloyed steels are ferritic or body-centred.
An only moderate tenacity ratio of from 1-42 to 1-78 in liquid hydrogen is characteristic
of all except one, No. 3754, of the austenitic ferrous alloys in the present research, and
of the metals copper and nickel, which have the same form of atomic structure.

The hardness of 1449A (31-4 nickel) at ordinary temperature has increased from 162 to
317. The large increase in its tenacity at the temperature of liquid hydrogen from 43 to
118 tons per square inch, a ratio of 2-76, was to be expected from the fact that it is
permanently transformed, owing toits higher carbon and manganese contents, although
be it noted that the increase is no greater than at liquid air temperature.

Class 8a. Iron and Manganese with low Carbon.—With 15-27% manganese in steel
No. 1379D/2, the effect of low temperature in increasing the tenacity is still further
reduced, but the rather low ratio of increase is, as in No, 4147/104, 1-04°%, Mn,
maintained the same, at about 1-2, in liquid hydrogen and in liquid air. Also, although
its ductility at ordinary temperature was only 5%, it still retained 24% in liquid air.
The effect of manganese cannot, therefore, be regarded as completely unfavourable.

Class 8b. Iron and Manganese with higher Carbon.—In the presence of a higher
carbon content, as shown by steel No. 1010, the behaviour of iron-manganese alloys
