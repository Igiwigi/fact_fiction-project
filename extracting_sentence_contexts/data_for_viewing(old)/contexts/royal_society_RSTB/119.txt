Mr. Krynear, the head of the Sanitary Department of Dundee, was good enough
to place at our disposal a horse and covered van, by which means we were enabled to
â€˜make the analyses in the street outside the houses selected for examination. Two of
the inspectors belonging to the same department assisted us in our work in the case
of the poorer class of houses. Those houses were visited without warning of any
kind to the inhabitants, so as to avoid the risk of having the rooms specially venti-
lated in preparation for our visit, In every case but one we were most civilly

room, and obtain such information as was required. We were, in fact, agreeably

of avoiding unnecessary movements such as were likely to stir up dust and contami-
nate the air. In the case of one-roomed houses the samples were taken about the
centre of the room. In two-roomed houses we found that the door was always kept
open between the two rooms, and that usually there were people sleeping in both
rooms. We therefore in those cases took the samples by the door communicating
between the two rooms. About ten minutes in each room were, as a rule, required in
order to take the specimens, measure the room, &c., and about twenty minutes subse-
quently for determining the carbonic acid and organic matter in the van. Half-an-
hour in all was, therefore, required for each house. We could thus visit five or six
houses each night, besides taking and analysing samples of outside air in the courts
