We may give this case a purely literal form by writing 100 = a, 010 = b, 001 = ¢,
and then we have a lattice of s columns and ¢ rows, such that the products of
letters in the successive rows are a”b%c", a™b%e", . . . a’b%c" respectively, and in the
successive columns a*b*c", abc, . . . abc" respectively. Art. 14.—Stated in this form the problem appears to have a close relationship to
the problem of the Latin Square. It is in fact a new generalization of that problem ;
for put s = t = 3 and

A=H= 1 =P =B=%=P=hB=%3= 1

AHH Hn = hH=hH=H=S=KB_=Hy=1

so that the operation is Di,, and the function a. One lattice is then

or in literal form

[ale]
je [fa
[ale] >|

which is a Latin Square. Hence the numbers of Latin Squares of order 3 is

3 3
2 Din Ain»
and in general of order
D

a very simple solution of the problem.
