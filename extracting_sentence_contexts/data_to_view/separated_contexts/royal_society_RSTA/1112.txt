This is not surprising; even in the case of
substances which can be obtained in the form of large single crystals, Turron* remarks
that measurements on several crystals are made and the highest value is adopted. The
difficulties of measurement on organic substances, which are usually in the form of
micro-crystals, are naturally greater, and hence the above discrepancies. In fact, it
has been suggested by Brace} that the calculation of the density from the size of the
unit cell determined by X-ray methods is likely to give a more accurate value than
direct methods of measurement. Thus it is clear that in our calculation of the gram molecular susceptibility of a crystal
from its volume susceptibility we have to use the proper value of the density for the
particular crystal used. This was determined by the “ immersion” method, using a
solution of zine sulphate for the purpose.
