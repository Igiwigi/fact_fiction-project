No mammary gland
development was observed. In view of the numbers of animals examined it is doubt-
ful if this anomalous specimen has any significance. To summarize, the stoat reproductive cycle shows at least two interesting features,
the first being the fact that whereas the male has a complete anoestrus, the female
can apparently ovulate at all times of the year, and the second being the frequent
occurrence in both mated and unmated animals of infertile reproductive cycles. Such apparent inefficiency in breeding seems to be commoner in wild species than
would be expected. Hedgehogs show infertile reproductive cycles in both mated and
unmated animals (DEANEsLy, 1934), and there is also clear evidence of infertile cycles
