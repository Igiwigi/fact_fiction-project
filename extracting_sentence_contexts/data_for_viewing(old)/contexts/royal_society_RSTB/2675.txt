phyllum, ave admitted to have a “‘ Rugose epitheca” and “ irregular continuations ” ;
newer-fashioned colonies, of Turbinaria for example, are said to have a “theca” and
a “coonenchyme”; yet I see no real morphological difference between the old and
the new fashion. The costate wall has been developed us a wonderfully complete
canalicular system, but the ccenenchyme in the case of Madreporide, Pocilloporide,
and Poritinse is nothing more than a ramifying modification of the primitive
tangential structure (cf antea, pp. 261-268).

I have thus traced the history both of the solid Turbinolid “wall” and the
“ Perforate wall” of the allied reef-builders back to the basal skeletal dise of the
primitive Madreporarian. The theca with epithecal surface is probably more ancient
than the free “inner wall” or “ pseudotheca ” of Cyathophylloid and Astreid types
and many other facts corroborate this conclusion. The bilateral symmetry of the
polyps of Seriatopora and Madrepora is in keeping with the primitive nature of
their coenenchyme.

With regard to the phylogeny of the theca, pseudotheca, and coonenchyme in
Madreporaria we may distinguish the following evolutionary stages :—

L. The ancestral stage frequent enough in Paleozoic corals—a “ Rugose epitheca”
without any centres of calcification in connection with the septal centres.

Il.—(a). Theca in solitary corals.—The differentiation of an inner part of the
epitheca as a theca possessing centres of calcification connected with the septal centres.
In this case there is never more than one wall, composed of theca and epitheca
