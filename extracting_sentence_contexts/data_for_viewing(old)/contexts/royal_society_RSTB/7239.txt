In interpreting these results it must be remembered that there is a tendency amongst
diatoms, as in so many other groups, for forms with an arctic-alpine distribution in central
Europe to be found at comparatively low altitudes in the west of Britain. Another point to
be noted is that a number of the halophobous, acidophilous and oligotrophic diatoms found
infrequently in this deposit are much more characteristic of streams than of ponds or lakes,
and probably did not grow in the pool on the floor of which this deposit was formed, but
were washed into it in the waters of the streams feeding it. Bearing these facts in mind we
may deduce with some certitude that the temperature at the time when this deposit was
being laid down did not differ appreciably from that of England at the present day, and
that the pool in which it was formed was a moderately eutrophic one with a chloride content
of 15 to 25 mg. Clâ€™ per litre and a pH slightly over 7. The waters of the streams draining into
the pool were probably of lower chloride content and pH than those of the pool itself.

For a few of the diatoms found in the material from Hawks Tor the names in current use
are illegitimate, and no legitimate name is available. The necessary new combinations are
made below:
