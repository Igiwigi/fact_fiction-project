This thus unambiguously implies that the studied saprolite
was always exposed within the first metres and therefore was
never deeply buried by the alluvial deposits.

In the alluvial deposit above the interface, concentrations
are, at first glance, more randomly distributed for samples
from both the 2018 and 2019 field campaigns. This was one
