Farieties of the sodic sulphate are noticed, 7. e. the anhydrous, the ordinary 10-atom
Bydrate, and also a modified salt formed when supersaturated solutions are left to cool
Down in closed vessels. This salt contains less water of crystallization than the ordinary
Salt, and is more soluble. If the vessel in which it is formed be snddenly opened, or a
:ucleus touch the mother-liquor, this instantly solidifies into the 10-atom hydrate, and
Ahe erystals of the more soluble salt become opaque, like the boiled white of egg.
> In 1819 Gay-Lus8acft, referred the state of supersaturation to the inertia of the saline
IMnolecules, the molecular condition of the sides of the vessel, and other causes. He also
Showed that solutions of some other salts besides GLAUBER's salt exhibit the phenomena
of supersaturation. In 1832 the number of such salts was stated by Dr. OcDexy to be
Mot less than 21.
65 In 1825 Faravar || published some experiments on the supersaturated solutions of
SGLAUBER's salt. GrAnantd, TurNER**, URE, and others also contributed new facts; but
the most elaborate inquiry was made by M. L6wEL between the years 1850 and 1857, the
Aresults of which are contained in six memoirsfF. According to this writer, the modified
salt is formed in consequence of a molecular change which takes place when a solution
saturated at 218* Faur. cools down to 64‚Äù. The modified salt is much more s0luble at
ordinary temperatures than the 10-atom hydrate, its maximum solubility being at 80*6.

The sodic sulphate has three maxima of s0lubility, viz. 93*2 for the 10-atom hydrate,

78%8 to 809-6 for the T-atom hydrate, and 62%6 to 64:4 for the anhydrous salt. At
