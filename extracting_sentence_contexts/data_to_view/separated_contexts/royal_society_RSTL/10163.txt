A

Sar more credible conclusion is that the yolk-vesicles are taken bodily into the cells

-2.in 8uch numbers as finally to obscure the cell-outlines entirely. The entoderm then

E seems to have disappeared and only makes its re-appearance when the yolk-vesicles

Shave been assimilated by the protoplasm of the cells. This conclusion is sbrengthened

= Z by the fact that in JourDaN's figure of the larva of Actinia equina (l.c., fig. 119,
S plate 16) the entoderm cells are figured, before the absorption of the yolk has begun,
as clear, well defined, and destitute of yolk-vesicles, while the gastric cavity is

Z completely filled with * vesicules hyalines ” precisely like those of Balanophyllia. D This condition, according to my view, precedes one like the earlier stage of Balano-

S phyllia im which absorption has recently begun and in which the entoderm cells

E resemble those of Astacus, as figured by RewcnexBACH,*

- In all known Aleyonarians the central mass, though at firss unsegmented, does
800ner or later divide into cells, although many of these perform no active function,
become disorganised, and serve only as food for other cells. This indicates that the
yolk-cells are the descendants of cells which were once of structural significance ;
for otherwise their formation and subsequent disintegration would seem to be a sheer
waste of energy.
