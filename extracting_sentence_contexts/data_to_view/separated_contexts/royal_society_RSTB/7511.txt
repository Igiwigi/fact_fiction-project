The only links with Europe or elsewhere yet found with the Ermoceras fauna in Arabia
are the three Stephanoceratids, Stephanoceras cf. psilacanthus Wermbter, Teloceras cf. labrum
Buckman, Normannites cf. orbignyi Buckman. All three indicate the Humphriesianum Zone,
and more especially the highest subzone (Blagdeni). This fact and the absence of Streno-
ceras, Garantiana, or Parkinsonia, infallible indices of the Upper Bajocian all over the world,
at first led me to assume the age of the Ermoceras fauna to be highest Middle Bajocian. In Sinai there is considerably more evidence. H.
