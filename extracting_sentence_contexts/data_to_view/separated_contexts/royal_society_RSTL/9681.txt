The two remaining months of the grass
8eason were, however, unusually cold, May being at the same time very wet, but June
dry, a condition which was compensated by the previous abundance of moisture ;
whilst, although the ruling temperatures were low for those months, they were yet
actually 8ufficient for active vegetation. The result was luxuriant, and suceulent,
though not maturing, growth. Indeed, according to notes taken on the ground, the
plots generally manifested great luxuriance ; but the most prominent plants, whether
gramineous, leguminous, or miscellaneous, were much more backward than usual at
bhe time of cutting,

It would thus appear that the excessive produce of grass in 1869 was by no means
due alone, or even perhaps chiefly, to the climatic conditions during the limited period
of really active accumulation and aboveground growth, which, in fact, were not
gpecially favourable ; but the result was due to the only moderately favourable
conditions during that period, succeeding upon very favourable, instead of as usual
detrimental ones, throughout the three winter months, thus bringing the herbage
unusually forward, and rendering it the more capable of turning to the best account
such climatic elements of growth as followed. Tt may here be remarked that this result is 80mewhat analogous to that observed
in the case of our experiments on the continuous growth of wheat ; the seasons of
extraordinary productiveness of that crop having been marked, rather by moderately
favourable conditions throughout, than by specially favourable ones during the period
of most active above-ground growth. Let us now contrast with the foregoing conditions of extremely luxuriant growth,
those under which the smallest produce of the 20 years was obtained.
