Finely-divided platinum, silver or carbon, decompose it, but far less rapidly
than those substances which are themselves also decomposed. I will not here discuss
the general chemical reactions of this peroxide, but defer their consideration until I
can treat with advantage, in a more exact manner, of the general theory of this action. The facts I have just mentioned gave a direction to my experiments, and instead
of the peroxide of hydrogen, the preparation and preservation of which involved
many difficulties, and with which it was inconvenient to work, I determined to use,
in the experiments I proposed, the peroxide of barium itself. * See Barium superoxyd, Handworterbuch der Chemie, vol. i. p. 667. AT THE MOMENT OF CHEMICAL CHANGE.
