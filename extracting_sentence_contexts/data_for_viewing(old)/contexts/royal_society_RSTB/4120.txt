paper I shall deal with the endemic flora. Though only separated from India by a
narrow strait, which at Adam’s Bridge is barely 28 miles across, sprinkled with islets
and sandbanks, and from 6 to 12 feet in depth at low water, Ceylon contains
an immense endemie flora, which enables it to rank with many oceanic islands: even
the Sandwich Islands have not so many. The flora of Ceylon consists of 2809 species
of flowering plants,t and of these no fewer than 809 are endemic, or a proportion of
28°8 per cent. And these are not mere varieties, or doubtful species, but good
Linnean species, accepted by such authorities as TRrmmeN and Sir Josern Hooker.
On the other hand, the number of endemic genera is only 23 out of 1027, so that the
island does not rise to the rank of a widely separated province in geographical
botany.

Incidentally, the facts about to be brought forward are an apparently insuperable
objection to the theory of natural selection and adaptation. In previous papers
