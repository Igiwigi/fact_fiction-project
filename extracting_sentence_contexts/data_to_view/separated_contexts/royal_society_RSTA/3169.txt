According to Alves et al. [5], one 23
expects Aq < 10-7 from these ideas. If one allows for derivative couplings, and generic
scalar fields (I am thinking about scalars with expectation values, more complicated mea)
kinetic terms, etc.) it is not clear to me that this bound is unsurmountable. :

â€” Another important caveat comes from the composite nature of nucleons. In fact, the [4
virtual content (or self-energy or binding energy) is very important in nucleons at rest. DN
This has been used to claim that, since most of the mass of antihydrogen comes from 2S
gluons, only a 1% deviation for A, is possible when one considers the gravitation of 28
antihydrogen, given the current constraints on the gravitation of hydrogen [4]. This .
argument says nothing about new charges which do not affect the gluons, and thus I
do not think is very strong in this framework.> Also, an important contribution to the
nucleon itself comes from virtual antiquarks.
