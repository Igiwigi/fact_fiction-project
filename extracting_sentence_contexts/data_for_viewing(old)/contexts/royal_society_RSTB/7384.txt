Nottinghamshire: limited to the ‘Bunter’ area where it persisted in 1904 (Carr).

North Lincolnshire: formerly in Axholme Island in the north until 1895, and at Friskney
and Wainfleet Tofts in the south (Woodruffe-Peacock (c. 1920)).

North of these localities, E. nigrum occurs on Cannock Chase and several places in north
Staffordshire (Bagnall 1901), becoming abundant on the Pennines of north Derbyshire, and
occurring in all vice-counties to the north, except south-east Yorkshire, where it may once
have grown (Cheetham & Sledge 1941). It occurs abundantly throughout Scotland where
it descends to sea-level; it is widespread in Ireland.

E. hermaphroditum (Lange) Hagerup is now known to occur in this country, and some of
the more northern localities for E. nigrum may in fact refer to this species: it has been
recorded from Wales (Snowdonia), northern England and from several parts of Scotland.
Outside Great Britain it ranges considerably farther north, to 79° N., as opposed to 63° N.,
and also occurs on the high alps of Europe.

E. nigrum is known from the Irish late-Glacial at Ballybetagh, near Dublin, zones II and
III (Jessen & Farrington 1938). Jessen (1949) has pointed out that the pollen of E. nigrum
can be distinguished by its smaller size from that of EL. hermaphroditum, and refers the
abundant Empetrum pollen of the late-Glacial in Ireland to E. nigrum L.

The pollen (see § 5) comes from the Carex-wood peat, or from the junction of this with
the gravelly-soil, or from the gravelly-soil itself. This corresponds with the position at which
the stone was found at site 36. The pollen size indicates that this also was F. nigrum L.
