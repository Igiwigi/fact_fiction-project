Considering that each coil consists of several loops (turns) in series (i=1,2,...,N3 for
the calibration coil and j=1,2,...,Nz, k=1,2 for the detection coils), we have the following
expression:

The frequency dependence of M;(f) is evaluated to determine the electrical conductivity
o =ox of the slab (see §4c) using the fact that o enters Mx(f) only in the form fo. We perform
a fit (preferably simultaneously to both real and imaginary parts) of the normalized function

The influence of the superconducting shield is estimated by comparing the results for Mj in the
infinite space with those obtained in a superconducting sphere, Mx, which has the same radius as
the superconducting cylinder. Confining the field into a sphere instead of a cylinder provides an
upper limit of the edge effect, which is sufficient for the uncertainty calculation. As the system of
detection coils, calibration coil and superconducting sphere is again rotational symmetric, two-
dimensional models are adequate to solve this problem.
