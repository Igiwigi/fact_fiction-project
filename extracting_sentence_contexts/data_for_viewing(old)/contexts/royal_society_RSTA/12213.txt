Maximum B = mm NA/2 ’

where E is the observed electromotive force in a coil of N turns, the area of curve-
section of the iron being A and the frequency n. But even if the magnetizing force
were simply harmonic it is otherwise with B, whose increment and decrement is
largely affected by magnetic hysteresis. The relation of maximum B to mean ~
(dB/dt)? could be determined if the form of the curve of Band ¢ were known. Recent
experiments—amongst others, those of Dr. Jonw Hopkinson and Messrs. WILSON
and Lypaut,* in which B as well as dB/dt has been determined as a function of ¢ in

a ring submitted to alternating magnetic forces—exemplify how wide the variation
from a sine-function is likely to be. In view of this consideration, and of the fact
that no such data were at hand in the case of our own tests, we have not followed
up this method of directly measuring the heat produced by reversals.

EXPERIMENTS MADE WITH THE Magnetic Curve TRACER.

When the magnetism of a piece of iron is reversed rapidly more work'is spent than
when the reversal takes place slowly. Whether all the extra work done in the
former case is to be set down to Foucault currents is, perhaps, an open question ; there
may bea genuine time-lag in the process of magnetization, independent of the effect
of Foucault currents, though not readily distinguishable experimentally from their
effect. This quasi-viscosity, distinct from Foucault-current effects, will, if it exists,
require higher values of H to be applied than would otherwise be necessary when any
