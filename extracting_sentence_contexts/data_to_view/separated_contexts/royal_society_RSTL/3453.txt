In all of these I observed the tabular part filled with granular matter, and similarly
collected in minute masses. I also observed that each tube was surrounded by the minute serpentine threads
before described. In fact so closely did they agree, in every particular, with the ap-
pearances presented by the uterine nerves, that it would have been impossi√æle to di-
stinguish the one from the other. Thus by comparing the unknown with the known, despite the want of any abso-
Jute test, I feel perfectly satisfied of the true nervous character of the very beautiful
plexuses you have $0 patiently and with 80 much labour developed. Adwmitting then this intricate structure to be really nervous, it is a matter of no
marvyel that they increase in size during pregnancy.
