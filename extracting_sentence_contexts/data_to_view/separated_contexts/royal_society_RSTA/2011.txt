This coupling may operate not only from cell to whole
organ, but also in the reverse direction. Co-variances among model parameters, especially
at different scales, are also an important consideration. A recent study has reviewed
sensitivity analysis in many different modelling applications, and has highlighted the
fact that many sensitivity analyses are flawed because model input spaces have not been
explored thoroughly taking into account co-varying inputs [122]. Cardiac electrophysiology models have become a valuable tool not only for basic science, but
also have been proposed for transition into clinical applications [98,99,117,118]. The credibility of
model outputs has therefore become an important challenge.
