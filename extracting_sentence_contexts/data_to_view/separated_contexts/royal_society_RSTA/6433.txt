Furthermore, we consider the
impact of a boundary layer emerging in the resonator neck, giving rise to viscous dissipative
losses. Although a lossy neck gives rise to moderate values for the absorption efficiency, the
corresponding reduction in the scattering efficiency has the net effect of diminishing the extinction
efficiency at the first Helmholtz resonance and beyond, where in the limit of large loss, we find
that all cross-sections return to the results for a Neumann cylinder, as expected. In general, the
maximal scattering efficiency Qsc is found for incidence wave angles that lie along the mirror
symmetry plane for the resonator, despite the fact that very different scattered field profiles
are observed for inc =0 and OinÂ¢ =. The formulation presented here should prove useful for

ongoing theoretical and experimental work by other groups [15,31,32]. : =

Another formalism for describing wave scattering by objects is the resonance scattering : =
theory (RST) framework [33-35]. This involves expanding the scattered field in terms of a sum :3
of singularities in the complex frequency domain.
