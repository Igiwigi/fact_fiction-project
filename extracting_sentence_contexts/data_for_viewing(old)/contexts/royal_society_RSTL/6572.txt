of the spectrum be at a minimum deviation, the lines immediately about P are reduced
almost to points, which are the images, for light of that refrangibility, of the tips of the
electrodes, or, to speak more exactly, of the part of the spark Just outside the tips.
But in the secondary plane the rays on one side of P haye not yet reached their focus,
and on the other side haye passed it; 80 that the image of a point is a line, the primary
focal line, of a length increasing on receding from P in either direction, and accordingly
the spectral image of either tip, asxumed to be a mere point, would be a pair of slender

in the plane of refraction. The invisible Spectrum is in fact made up bs two such pairs
of triangles corresponding to the two tips respectively, as Dey] be readily seen when the
electrodes are not too close. At a distance from P at which the length of the primary
focal line becomes equal to that of the image of the spark, the two ma which are the
images, for rays of the refrangibility answering to that distance, of the tips of the elec-
trodes meet in the middle of the spectrum, and beyond that distance they overlap, 80 that
a line appears to run across the spectrum, though it relates to rays which emanated only
from the immediate neighbourhood of the tips of the electrodes, as may be seen by turning
the prism till that part of the spectrum is at a minimum deviation, and focusing afresh.

Besides the bright lines, evidently due to metals, which have been mentioned, other
weaker light is perceptible, too faint for precise observation. A portion of this is pro-
bably due to the air.
