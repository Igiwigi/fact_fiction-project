1. Introduction

RNA viruses are the most abundant parasites infecting humans, wildlife,
livestock and crops. Despite tremendous efforts, the number of eradicated
viruses is quite limited and the perspectives for future eradications are counter-
balanced by the emergence of new viruses [1]. The fact that few viruses can be
effectively controlled and the pervasive emergence of new ones are probably
consequences of virusesâ€™ remarkable ability to evolve. As a consequence of
their error-prone replication, RNA viruses exist as complex mutant swarms
[2]. Indeed, owing to mutational coupling among genotypes, complex mutant
swarms and not individual genomes become the target of selection. This high
genetic variability combined with very short generation times and large
population sizes bestow a tremendous evolutionary potential (e.g. evolvability)
on viral populations. Major events in RNA virus, such as their capacity to
change host ranges, alter cell tropisms and overcome resistance genes, antiviral
responses or drug therapies, have their origin in the repertoire of genetic
variants contained in the mutant swarm. Our ability to predict the evolution
of viral populations and to design efficient and durable antiviral strategies is
