Persistent locomotory activity is not in itself what distinguishes the migrant, however. Such activity is the normal behaviour of insects which are obviously not migrant, like
whirligig beetles (Gyrinidae) or the many kinds of insects which form persistent swarms
during the nuptial flight, such as mayflies (Ephemeroptera). What separates the behaviour
of these insects from that of a migrant is not only the fact that they remain in roughly the
same place, but also that their simple locomotion is readily interrupted by other kinds of
behaviour: feeding and mating, respectively, in the examples mentioned. Indeed, the
immediate effect of their locomotory activity is to expose them more effectively to the

specific stimuli which interrupt it: the whirligig beetle to floating food particles and the
mayfly to its potential mates. Their locomotory activity may be regarded as an essential
part of the activities of feeding and mating.
