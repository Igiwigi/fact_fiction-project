put an end to any version of preformationism by showing that there is a very early stage in the
development of all animals where the entire embryo consists in a few sheets, or gerntinal layers, of
organic matter [2]. That made it clear that the development of an embryo is not only a process of
growth, but also a step-by-step emergence of new structures that increase the complexity of the
developing creature.
The theory of design took much longer to be accepted and that happened when Monod [3],
Delbriick [4], Mayr [5] and many others pointed out that the immanent design of Aristotle is
virtually equivalent to the genetic programme.

2. Do we understand development?

To a large extent it is legitimate to say that modern embryology has rediscovered the theories
of epigenesis and design proposed by Aristotle. Today, in fact, there is a virtually universal
consensus on the idea that embryonic development is the result of a genetic programme and of epigenetic
processes.

This may give the impression that we now understand, at least in principle, the logic of
embryonic development, and all that remains to be done is to fill in the details. In The Problems of
Biology, however, Maynard Smith [6, pp. 99-100] lucidly sounded a note of caution against this
attitude:

It is popular nowadays to say that morphogenesis (that is the development of form) is
programmed by the genes. I think that this statement, although in a sense true, is unhelpful.
