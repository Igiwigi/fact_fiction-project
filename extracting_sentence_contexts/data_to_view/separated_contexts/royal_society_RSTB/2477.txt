The great extent of their sensitive areas,
the shape of the often large pupil—especially the horizontally oval pupil—and the
refraction, favour this hypothesis. _ Hereto comes another fact which I have observed,
viz., that the cornea is much larger in those animals which have a divergence of more
than 50° or 60°. In addition, these animals have nearly spherical lenses. Evidently
these latter facts are of much greater importance than the size of the pupil, as we
know by analogy with a camera, that the size of the stop does not affect the field or
angle of view, which is solely dependent on the shape of the lenses in the combina-
