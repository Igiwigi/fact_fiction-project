lymphatic system and the ordinary lymphatics the efferent component (lymph veins).

Neither JourpAtIn nor Mayer give any indication of the source from which the
afferent vessels derive their contents, nor any very satisfactory explanation of the means
by which the lymph circulation is driven, though it is suggested by JourDAIN that the
flow is probably effected by the muscular respiratory movements, and by Mayer that
the source of propulsion is the heart. JouRDAIN gives no idea what the object of this
type of lymph circulation may be, but Mayer is led to suppose that it is to convey
nutrient material (in the form of granules in the leucocytes) from the viscera to the
peripheral parts.

When one reviews, in the light of Jourparn’s and Mayer’s researches, the whole
of the facts set forth above, I think that the conclusion to which one must come, at
least provisionally, is: (1) That the vessels of the “ fine” system here described are
the afferent part of a lymphatic system with a double circulation (similar to that of
the blood vascular system), the terminal parts of which in the fins were seen in action
by Jourpatn and Mayer. (2) That the system commences in an open network in the
mucous membrane of the mouth, pharynx, and gills, receiving its contents through
small-valved connectives from a fine network of lymph capillaries situated close beneath
the mucous epithelium. (3) That from this origin its vessels are distributed alongside
the ordinary (efferent) lymphatics throughout the anterior part of the body to the
arteries, connective tissues and skin, and that probably (though of this I have little
direct evidence) in these areas of distribution its terminal networks connect up with
the terminal branches of the ordinary lymphatics, and thus through them complete
the path of circulation, returning the lymph from the periphery vid the ventral system
