variability and biases tend to be positive (0.3 + 1.0ms™') in the Atlantic and strongly negative
(—1.4 + 1.0ms~') in the Pacific sectors. It is worth noting that, while there is some uncertainty in
the accuracy of reanalysis datasets, the variability between three reanalysis products compared by
Bracegirdle et al. [33] was negligible in comparison with inter-model differences, even taking into
account the fact that the reanalysis-derived uncertainty is probably slightly smaller than actual
observational uncertainties [35].

Under the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios, there is a clear trend in westerly winds towards
stronger and more poleward jets, with a directly associated positive trend in the SAM [36]. This
proceeds in three broad phases: an increase in strength and poleward shift in the late twentieth
century, a weaker change over the first half of the twenty-first century and then a clear poleward
shift and strengthening winds in the latter half of the twenty-first century. The plateau at the
start of the twenty-first century is probably due to the recovery of the Austral summer ozone
hole counteracting carbon forcing during this period [33]. This shows that the inclusion of ozone
forcing has had a measurable impact on wind stress [37], although, in terms of position and jet
strength, this effect is most pronounced in weaker RCP scenarios; and under RCP8.5, the effect
of ozone recovery on jet position is almost negligible relative to GHG forcing [38]. The annular
