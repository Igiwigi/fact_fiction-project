i permeability is almost the same in all sensibly non-magnetic bodies as in a vacuum

74. The notion of illustrating magnetic induction by the permeation of a fluid
through a porous medium containing obstacles to its motion has been shown by Lord
' Ketvryt to lead to a complete formal representation of the facts of diamagnetism ;
