But water is only
1200 times heavier than steam, or water in the state of vapour. Therefore, there is a variation in +, of 898, or nearly half, be-
tween the density of water and its elements, when both are in the
aeriform state. This fact, however, regards bodies only as they
remain in the same $tate, whether of solidity, liquidity, or fluidity. The anomaly is much greater, if we contemplate them as they
pass from one of these states to the other. Yet we must not
omit the consideration of such a change, in the instance of
mercury alloyed with platina; for the former metal, before liquid,
becomes 5olid as it enters into the new combination.
