Received February 3,—Read February 27, 1919. SusPENDING one pole of a carbon are and keeping the other pole fixed it was found
that there was an apparent repulsion between them. There is in fact a pressure
upon each electrode which tends to separate them. The first part of this paper is
devoted to the experimental methods of estimating this pressure, the second to a
discussion of its origin. PART IL—EXPERIMENTAL.
