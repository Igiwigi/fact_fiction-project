XVIIâ€”ReEspiratory ADAPTATIONS

The larvae of Mycetophilidae are found in wet media. When exposed to a dry
atmosphere they die in 30-40 minutes. Humidity, therefore, is essential for their life.

All the mature larvae of Mycetophilidae are peripneustic except Ceroplatus,
Diadocidia, and Speolepta. The former is apneustic, the latter two are propneustic.
In Ceroplatus, the tracheal system is well developed but functional spiracles are absent.
The body of this larva is elongated and provided with four protrusible anal lobes,
the skin is thrown into numerous folds which increase its surface, the integument is
thin and richly supplied with a sub-cuticular net of tracheoles and the larva lives
under a hygroscopic tent of saliva. These facts seem to indicate that the conditions
for cutaneous respiration are specially favourable.


BIOLOGY AND MORPHOLOGY OF THE MYCETOPHILIDAE 103

In Diadocidia and Speolepta, the conditions for cutaneous respiration are also
favourable, the larvae being slender, elongated, and provided with anal lobes. The
integument also is thin and the larvae live in slimy hygroscopic tubes. The absence
of abdominal spiracles may be due to an arrest of their development owing to the
favourable conditions in which they live. The presence, on the other hand, of a
pair of prothoracic spiracles supplying the head, the pro- and mesothoracic segments
may assist the less active cuticular respiration of the chitinized head with its actively
