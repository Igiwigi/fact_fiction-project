In habit, Z. primaria was a large tree-fern; the slender leaf-bearing axis was held
erect by a thick supporting armour of petiole-bases and adventitious roots. The young -
leaves and aphlebiee were clothed in a dense ramentum of scales. The investigation of the anatomy has revealed facts of a very unexpected nature. It has been ascertained beyond doubt that Z. primaria had typical Etapteris petioles,
borne upon a stem having the Botrychioxylon type of stele; the leaf-trace sequence and
