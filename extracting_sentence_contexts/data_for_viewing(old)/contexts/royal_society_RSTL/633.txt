In the HuxnTeran Museum, intrusted by government to the
care of the College of Surgeons, there are several specimens of
these bags, from the Egyptian antelope with annulated horns,
and also from some other species : these are preserved $0 as to
Show the internal cavity of the bag, and the structure of the
gland immediately behind it. In these specimens, the glandular
part is Â£ of an inch in thickness; from the centre of this gland,
an excretory duct opens into the bag, immediately opposite to
the external orifice. The bag itself is lined with a cuticle, and
thinly set with strong hairs.

The facts now produced are sufficient to prove that these bags
have a secretion of their own, the quantity of which varies, ac-
cording to the climate and other circumstances; and there is
no reason for thinking that the tears ever pass into them, the
passage into the nose being unusually free, and the orifices in
the bags, in many species, unfayourably situated for the reception
of the tears.

We are at present unacquainted with the use to which the
fAluid secreted in these bags is applied.

As amphibious animals, in general, have no glands to supply
the skin with moisture from within, but receive it by coming in
