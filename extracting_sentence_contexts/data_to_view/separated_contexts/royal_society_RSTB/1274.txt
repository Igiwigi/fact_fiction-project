We may fairly assume that they will similarly function wit
20 metres of water hanging upon them within the conduits of the tree ; or, what!
the same thing, they can lift this column of water. There was nothing. revealed

power of the leaf to withstand pressure. We find, in fact, capillary forces (if, indee

certainly sufficient to lift the raw sap into tall trees. ; :

These éxperiments are in perfect agreement with Bornm’s* laborious researches,
