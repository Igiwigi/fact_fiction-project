purity given by this method the facts are as follows: an image of the observerâ€™s pupil is in

of 1-8 m., and an objective of 40 mm. focal length, the size of this image is approximately
0:10 mm. Now an image of this aperture is projected by the first lens of the reducing
apparatus into its own upper focal plane.
