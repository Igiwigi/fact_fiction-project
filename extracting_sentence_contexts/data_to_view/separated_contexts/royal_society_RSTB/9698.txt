Owing to the pay-off structure,
however, the temptation to defect is continuously present. Despite a perpetual temptation to defect, a variety of part-
ner control mechanisms can nevertheless lead to stable mutual
investments. In fact, economists have shown that solutions
with almost any frequency of investments are possible, pro-
vided mutual helping creates a surplus in pay-offs and a
sufficient number of rounds are played without a fixed
known final round (‘folk theorem’: [21]). Largely unaware of
the economic literature, evolutionary minded scientists have
spent considerable effort to identifying successful strategies
that start cooperatively and continue to cooperate as long as
the partner also cooperates (reviewed by Dugatkin [22]). In
the most famous strategy in an iterated prisoner’s dilemma
game, tit-for-tat, one individual cooperates on the first iteration
of the game and then does exactly what the partner has done
on the previous move, i.e. defect on a defector or cooperate
with a cooperator [23].
