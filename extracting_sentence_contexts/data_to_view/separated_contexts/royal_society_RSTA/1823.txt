Gases Ejected from Cast Tron on Setting. As bearing upon the question of the possibility of the occluded gases playing a
part, Morssan was the first to observe that spherules or small spheres of iron with
cracks and geodes never contained diamond. We have made experiments by pouring
highly carburized iron, alloys and mixtures on to iron plates, the cooling taking place
from one side only, and under such conditions no diamond results; in fact it only
occurs when the ingot or spherule is cooled on all sides nearly simultaneously, so that
an envelope of cold metal is formed all over before the centre sets. THE ARTIFICIAL PRODUCTION OF DIAMOND. 77

Since my paper in 1907, the experiment of heating iron in a carbon crucible and
transferring it to a steel die and subjecting it to 11,200 atmospheres pressure has
been repeated, and it has been found that if the iron is allowed to set before the
pressure is applied the amount of diamond is much greater than if pressed when very
hot and molten, and that it is then about the same as when the crucible is cooled in
water.
