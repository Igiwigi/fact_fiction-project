If the acting'/particles are involved in the constitution
of an electrolyte, then they can produce current force (921. 924.) proportionate to
the amount of chemical force consumed (868.).

2069. But the contact theory, which is obliged, according to the facts, to admit
that the acting particles are not changed (1802. 2067.) (for otherwise it would be the
chemical theory), is constrained to admit also, that the force which is able to make
two particles assume a certain state in respect to each other, is unable to make then
retain that state; and 80 it virtually denies the great principle in natural philosophy,
that cause and effect are equal (2071.). If a particle of platinum by contact with
a particle of zinc willingly gives of its own electricity to the zine, becanse this by its
presence tends to make the platinum assume a negative state, why should the particle
of platinum take electricity from any other particle of platinum behind it, since that
would only tend to destroy the very state which the zinc has just forced it into ? Such is not the case in common induction ; (and Marmanixt admits that the effect
of contact may take place through air and measurable distances*;) for there a ball
rendered negative by induction, will not take electricity from surronnding bodies,
however thoroughly we may uninsulate it ; and if we force electricity into it, it will, as
it were, be spurned back again with a power equivalent to that of the inducing body.
