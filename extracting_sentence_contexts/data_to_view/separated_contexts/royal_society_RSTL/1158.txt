The doctrine of flexibility furnishes an easy and satisfac-
tory explanation of the different colours which are assumed
by flame. Whether we suppose the light to come from the
burning body, or the oxygenous gaz, the largest or red par-
ticles have the strongest attraction for bodies, the violet the
weakest ; when therefore the gaz and the body combine, the
precipitation of light must be in the reverse order of the afti-
nity between the particles of light and those of the bodies. If
then the combination take place slowly, the violet and blue
particles will be first emitted, and last of all the red ; and this
is consistent with fact ; for any inflammable body whatever,

on being lighted, burns at first with a blue or violet flame,
and afterwards has its flame of two or three distinct colours,
blue, white, red, &c. as is seen remarkably in the case of a
candle. Nay, I have observed in the flame of a blow-pipe all
the seven primary colours at once, When, indeed, a body is
burnt in pure oxygenous gaz, the combination is s0 rapid, that
white light alone is precipitated undecomposed ; but in com-
mon air, where the azotic gaz impedes the combustion, the
above phenomena are obvious.
