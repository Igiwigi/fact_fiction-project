In order to produce a flexible multi-physics simulation capability, two obvious approaches : S
can be pursued. In one approach, pieces of existing single-physics codes can be assembled 2
into an overall coupled simulation code with appropriate interfaces to communicate between ae
the components. This is generally referred to as a ‘bottom-up’ framework approach (MCT [2], 72
SHARP [3,4]). The other approach is to use an integrated, coupled-physics modelling framework, [4
with new code pieces for each relevant physics area developed inside that framework. This is : ie
sometimes referred to as a ‘top-down’ framework approach (DUNE [5], MOOSE [6], KARMA [7], : BS
among several others). The former approach takes advantage of the fact that several man-years 18

invested in these existing verified and validated individual physics modelling codes are reusable,
but producing a multi-physics capability will then require some intrusive modifications to
enable appropriate software interfaces. The top-down framework approach avoids such intrusive
implementations by providing unified physics interface guidelines that simplify the software
overhead but at the substantial cost of re-writing all the necessary physics models from scratch,
including their verification and validation (V&V) suites.

The implementation of a verified multi-physics solver code also imposes a number of
requirements on the overall design aspects of the framework. Hence we need flexible interfaces
and robust solver options that encompass variations in a hierarchy of coupling algorithms
affecting the frequency and degree of coupling between the physics. Since the choice of
