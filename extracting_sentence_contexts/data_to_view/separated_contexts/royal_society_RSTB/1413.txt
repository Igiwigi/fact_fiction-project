One of us (D. H. Scorr) was enabled . M. Renavut’s kindness, to examine the specimen in question, and was di i

Although we cannot regard the evidence derived from this specimen (
imperfectly preserved) as by any means sufficient to establish the fact of hetero:
yet we fully allow the possibility that heterosporous species of Sphenophyllun
have existed. That both heterosporous and homosporous species may occ
the limits of a single genus, is sufficiently proved by the case of Calamos

The morphology of the strobilus of Sphenophyllum cannot be fully ini
until the true homologies of the sporangiophores are established. Four vie
