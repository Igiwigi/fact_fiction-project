The defenders of the doctrine of evolution hold that a space of time like that which
elapsed from the Devonian epoch to our period, is as a drop in the sea, when compared
with the time required for the development of organic life. From this point of view the
Ganoid fauna of the Deyonian and even the Pteraspis of the Upper Ludlow formation,
must have been preceded by long and yaried ichthyic series. Tristichopterus with its
os8eous vertebral column may have been the surviving representative of a Ganoid 8ub-
order then extinct, as Polypterus has been regarded as the sole suryivor of Crossoptery-
gians; and the Dipnoous type, as it appears to us for the first time in the Devonian
epoch, was not the beginning of a series, but the last of many preceding developmental
stages. Future discoveries in hitherto unexplored formations may prove these 8uppo-
sitions to be quite correct ; but when we limit ourselves for the present to the actual
evidence before us, we find it consists of the following facts only :â€”The Dipnoous type
is represented in the Devonian and Carboniferous epochs by several genera (Dipterus,
Cheirodus, Conchodus, Phaneropleuron); it is then lost down to the Trias and Lias, where
the scanty remains of a distinct genus, Ceratodus, testify to its presence ; no further
trace of it has been found until the present period, where it reappears in three genera,
one of which is identical with that of the Mesozoic era. Now at present scarcely any

* I do not attach any value to the terms subfamilies, families, suborders, &c., except as expressions of tho
relative degree of affinity; and in the preceding notes T haye used them in accordatice with the synoptical table
