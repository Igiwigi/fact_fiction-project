in Hlephas, rendered it possible for this animal to reach the ground with its lower
incisors. No doubt the portion of the mandible projecting beyond the upper jaw was
covered by a sort of proboscis formed by the combined nose and upper lip (compare
figs. 7 with 9 and 6 with 8); the extremity of this must have been more or less prehen-
sile and capable of thrusting the food, rendered available by the action of the incisors,
into the channel formed by the symphysial region of the mandible. Subsequently,
it must be supposed, that owing to some change in the nature of the food and probably
also to the increased efficiency of the end of the proboscis as an organ of prehension,
the mandible became shortened so that it was no longer possible for the animal to
reach the ground with its lower incisors, and when this happened the elongated
symphysis would not only cease to be of any service, but possibly even prove a
disadvantage as interfering with the free action of the proboscis, and therefore it was
rapidly lost. This may account for the fact that some species of Mastodon (e.g.,
M. americanus, see fig. 5), but little advanced beyond Tetrabelodon angustidens in
the structure of their molars, have the symphysis nearly as short as in Elephas, the
reason apparently being that while in the case of the molars the increase of efficiency
was gradual, in the case of the shortening of the symphysis and the projecting
incisors there was a sudden transition from utility to uselessness or worse.
Tetrabelodon seems to represent the stage at which the length of the mandible
culminated, for it is an animal of much the size and build of the elephant and yet
could reach the ground with its lower incisors. The above explanation of the possible
mode of origin of the trunk in the Proboscidea was in part, so far as the main points
are concerned, suggested to me by Professor E. R. LANKESTER,
