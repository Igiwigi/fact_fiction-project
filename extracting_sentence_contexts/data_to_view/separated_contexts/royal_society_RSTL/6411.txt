In each different compound, if such conyentional language be admissible, oxygen has
different properties; and if we are to account for this class of differences by the asxump-
tion of different varieties of oxygen, we must assume not two forms only, but an infinite
number of forms of that element. Of the precise mode in which the chemical pro-
perties of 'the compound are connected with the chemical properties of its constituents,
we are doubtless unable to give an adequate account. But the fact of this connexion
is not to be doubted. We take the oxygen of the peroxide of sodium, and transfer it
to the protoxide of manganese. In this new combination it will no longer produce the
effects of reduction.
