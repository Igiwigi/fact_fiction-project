new direction ; showing that the magnetism was in a different direction in the body

of the crystal to that which it had before. If now the magnet were reinvigorated
by the electric current, the crystal instantly spun round and took a magnetic state
in the first or original direction. The crystals could in fact become magnetized in
any direction, but there was one direction in which they could be magnetized with a
facility and force greater than in any other. From the appearances I am inclined to
refer this to the crystalline condition, but it may be due to an irregular diffusion of
iron in the masses of titanium. The crystals were too small for me. to make out the
point clearly.

2537. Copper â€”I elected some good crystals of native copper, and, having care-
fully separated them from the mass, examined them in respect of their magnecrystallic
force. At the horse-shoe magnet (2486.) they gave no signs of such power, what-
ever the direction in which they were suspended, but stood in any position ; and any
degree of torsion, however small, applied at the upper extremity of the suspending
filament was obeyed at once, and to the full extent, by the crystal beneath. When
