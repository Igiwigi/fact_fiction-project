Jounin concluded that microbes probably play an important part in the fixation
of nitrogen. He did not think that his results were favourable to the supposition
that the plants themselves effected the fixation. For the present he limits himself
to the establishment of the great fact of the fixation of the free nitrogen of the
atmosphere, leaving to the future the exact explanation. Tt is to be observed that the large gains shown were chiefly with a polygonous
plant, buckwheat, and not with plants of the leguminous family, which are reputed
to be “ nitrogen collectors.”

To show the practical importance of the fixation of free nitrogen, M. Jounre
calculates what would be the gain per hectare according to some of his results.
