such that uz — it weakly in L? as k > ov. D8

The significance of the failure of compactness in this theorem can be explained as follows. a
Since now (3.5) is replaced by (3.2), the only additional control on oscillatory behaviour must .
come from the equation itself, in particular integrability of the dissipative term. In other words,
combining the inertial, Reynolds and dissipative terms in (3.6) as one stress term of the form (u ®
it +R + Du + Du’), the issue is to decide whether Du + Du™ dominates it ® ii; thus, the failure of
the embedding W1! <> L? in three dimensions lies at the core of theorem 3.2.

To emphasize this point, we mention that in [34] the statement of theorem 3.2 was extended
to weak solutions of the hyperviscous Navier-Stokes equations, where the dissipative term Au is
replaced by —(—Au)® with @ <5/4, under the kinetic energy bound (3.2). This result is related to
the fact that the embedding W??-!! <> L? is compact if and only if @ > 5/4. Another variation on
this theme concerns power-law fluids, where Au is replaced by Apu, the p-Laplacian. In this case,
the energy bound including cumulative dissipation takes the form

t
sup (ae Hlifs + I, [[Dug(-, 7)|Ifp dr) <M. (3.7)
t

Thus, the issue of weak stability is decided by whether the embedding W1? <> L? is compact,
and indeed, the analogue of Leray’s theorem (existence of weak solutions satisfying the energy
inequality via compactness) has been proved in [35] for p> 6/5, whereas the analogue of
theorem 3.2 has been proved in [36] for p < 6/5.
