Text-riG. 3.—Figure of an adult tail vertebra. con., condyle (ball) of the vertebra ; cp., cup for articulating
with the next posterior vertebra ; d.shf., dorsal shelf; n.sp., neural spine ; .sp.fo., foramen for the
spinal nerve; pl.z., post-zygapophysis ; rb.pr., bifurcated rib bearer; v.shf., ventral shelf; h.sp.,
hemal spine. Discussion. It is now a well-established fact that the notochord of Urodela has two sheaths. First, the elastic sheath (primary chordal sheath, Kuaatscu, 1897), which arises directly
from the chorda when there are only a few vacuoles in it. Vacuolation increases to
such an extent that chorda cells are only present at the periphery forming the chordal
epithelium, and then the second layer of the chorda sheath or the fibrillar layer (secondary
chordal sheath, KLAATSCH,1897), or inner sheath (GOETTE,1875), or elastica interna (GADow,
1896), appears between the elastica externa and the peripheral chordal epithelium.
