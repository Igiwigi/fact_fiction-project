ocean deoxygenation, Last Glacial Maximum are located. Here, we combine global warming
and future projections, Earth System projections, model-based estimates of natural short-
modelling term variability, as well as data and model estimates of

the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) ocean oxygenation
to gain some insights into the major mechanisms
of oxygenation changes across these different time
scales. We show that the primary uncertainty on

tropical oceans is in fact controlled by a robust
compensation between decreasing oxygen saturation
(Ozsat) due to warming and decreasing apparent
oxygen utilization (AOU) due to increased ventilation
of the corresponding water masses. Modelled short-
term natural variability in subsurface oxygen levels
also reveals a compensation between Odsat and
