uterine horn. The epithelium was extremely attenuated, but strands of epithelial cells
occurred in each of a series of sections throughout this portion of the tube, and the uterine
lumen was found to be quite well defined. The lumen of the Fallopian tube was found to be
patent in another immature animal (E146), which was slightly bigger and evidently
somewhat older than E121, and the same was true of a very young calf (E134) and a late
foetus (E84).

The lumina of the right and left uterine horns remain distinct for some distance beyond
the point where the horns themselves fuse, as is shown, for instance, in figure 4, and then
open by simple orifices into a common lumen in the body of the uterus. In pregnant
animals it was found that the embryo was usually situated in that part of the uterus where
the horns are fused but where the right and left lumina are distinct. That this is the usual
site of implantation was confirmed by the fact that in many lactating animals the site of
a former placental attachment could be seen in this region.

Within the uterine horn the lumen gradually increases in diameter as it progresses
towards the junction of the right and left horns, and the surrounding muscle layer becomes

more massive. In the adult the uterine horn increases in diameter from about 4 cm near
the insertion of the ovarian ligament, to about 14 cm near the junction of the horns. These
measurements are necessarily very approximate, but they serve to give some idea of the
size and proportions of the uterus. It should be mentioned that the lumen is reduced to
