Thus, there are electro-magnetic welding techniques, such as induction, resistance or microwave
welding; friction welding techniques, such as ultrasonic or vibration welding; and thermal welding
techniques such as a hot tool or laser welding [1]. Common to all welding processes, the
joining mechanism is molecular inter-diffusion of polymer chains between welding partners,
which erases the initial welding interface(s). Polymer composite welding is mostly used for
thermoplastic composites owing to the fact that thermoplastic polymers can be softened and/or
melted upon the application of sufficient heat. However, recent research work has shown that
thermoset composites can be also welded if, for instance, they are provided with a thermoplastic-
rich outer surface [2]. Welding processes are in general faster and more composite-friendly than
adhesive bonding and mechanical fastening, respectively.
