The bees finding themſelves without a queen, made a-
{ſtrange buzzing noiſe, which laſted near two days; at-the
endof which they ſettled and betook themſelves towork :
on-the fourth. day F perceived in each hive the beginning.
of a royal cell, a certain indication, that one of the incloſed
2071S would ſoon be converted into. a.queen. The con-
ſtruction of the royal cell: being; nearly accompliſhed, I
_ ventured'to leaye an-opening forthe bees to get out, and
found that they returned as regularly as they doin com-
mon hives, and ſhewed no inclination to deſert their ha--
bitation. , But, tobe brief, at the end of twenty days, I ob-
ſerved four young queens among the new progeny. On relating the reſult of theſe experiments to a
member-of this unwerſity,, well converſant in the na--
tural hiſtory of bees, ie deemed it neceſſary, that: they
ſhould be. repeated, in order the better to eſtabliſh, the
truth of a fact ſeemingly ſo improbable, that the eggs
deſtined by natuxe to: produce neutral or common bees,
ſhould be transformed into females or queens. He ſtarted
an. objection to. me, which: by the publication of Mr. SCHIRACH/ appearing a little time after, ſeems to have
been pointed. out to that author alſo by Mr, w1iTHELM1,

beſides the eggs which ſhe depoſits in the royal cells,
might alſo have laid royal or female eggs either in the
common cells, or indiſcriminately throughout the dif-
ferent parts of the hive.
