Here, I(C) is the length of a cycle C in [C].

(d) Ramanujan graphs and the Riemann hypothesis
In 1966, Ihara gave a closed form for the zeta function of a regular graph.
Theorem 3.1 ([37]). Let X be a finite connected undirected (q + 1)-regular graph. Then

(1 — u2)x®

(G1) = Ta Au qe)’

where x(X) is the Euler characteristic of X and A = A(X) is the adjacency operator.

Since x(X) < 0, Z(X; 1) is in fact the reciprocal of a polynomial in 1. Similar to the Riemann zeta
function, Z(X;u) is said to satisfy the Riemann hypothesis if its non-trivial poles, namely, those
arising from the non-trivial eigenvalues of X in det(I — Au + qu7J), all have the same absolute
value q~1/?. Hence one obtains another criterion for Ramanujan graphs in terms of zeta functions,
namely X is a Ramanujan graph if and only if Z(X, u) satisfies the Riemann hypothesis.

4, Ramanujan complexes

Graphs are one-dimensional simplicial complexes. In this section, we consider their
generalization to higher-dimensional simplicial complexes, arising as finite quotients of the


buildings attached to PGL,. Parallel to §3, we discuss the spectral theory and Ramanujan
