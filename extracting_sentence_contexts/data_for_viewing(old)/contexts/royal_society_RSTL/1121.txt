When this substance is observed in the urine, the alkalies
are recommended. They are. exhibited either in a pure state,
or as carbonates, and in each instance the uric sediment gene-
rally diminishes rapidly, and during the continued use of alka-
line medicines, occasionally disappears altogether.

It however frequently happens that the matter voided, is
not diminished in quantity by the use of alkalies, but that its
form and composition are altered, and that it assumes the ap-
pearance of a gray powder, and is composed of uric acid with
variable portions of the ammoniaco-magnesian phosphate.

From these facts therefore, it cannot be doubted that the
internal exhibition of alkalies, often prevents the formation of
uric acid, and hence must likewise prevent the increase of a
calculus in the bladder, as far at least as uric acid is concerned ;
but it has also been supposed that the alkalies are capable of
acting upon the stone itself, and even of effecting its complete
80lution. It is true that if we immerse a calculus, composed
of uric acid, in a dilute solution of caustic alkali, that it will
be slowly acted upon,.and after some time entirely, dissolved.
