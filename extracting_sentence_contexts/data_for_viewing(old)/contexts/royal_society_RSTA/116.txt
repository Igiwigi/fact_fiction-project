with the morphogen gradient, can be created by combining multiple concentration gradients
of morphogens [9,10]. This proof temporarily reduced the interest in reaction—diffusion systems
among experimental biologists since the stripe expression pattern of segmental genes had earlier
been claimed by some mathematicians to be evidence of a reaction—diffusion system at work.

(c) Fish skin pattern as an experimental system to study the Turing pattern

Although the morphogen gradient model explains many pattern formation phenomena well,
it is not universally applicable. Pattern formation based on this principle is largely dependent
on the initial morphogen configuration, which makes it vulnerable to disturbance. On the
other hand, the phenomenon of animal development is generally known to be a highly robust
system. For example, hydra and planaria can regenerate a whole body from a small part, and
partial regeneration is universally observed in other higher organisms. This fact suggests that
an autonomous system, such as Turing’s mechanism, must intervene. The most direct way to
prove the existence of Turing’s principle is to apply perturbations to a spatial pattern of living
things and observe their dynamic reproduction process. The skin patterns of animals, as well as
those of fish and amphibians, are most suitable for this purpose. In many other experimental
systems, regeneration is difficult to analyse because it involves many complex phenomena,
starting with wound healing [8]. In addition, regeneration occurs only in the very early stages
of development. However, the skin patterns of fish and amphibians can often be regenerated in
adults, and disrupting the pattern does not affect the survival of the individual [2]. Furthermore,


dynamic changes in patterns can be observed without experimental manipulation. In fact, it was
the change in the pattern of the emperor angelfish that first alerted experimental biologists to the
