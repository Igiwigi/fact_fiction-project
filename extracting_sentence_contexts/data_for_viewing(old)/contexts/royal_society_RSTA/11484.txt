depended either on the direction or the strength of the current.

Another tube [No. C 4], (fig. 12), was made, having a thin bare platinum wire
stretched across the bulb between inserted terminals, P, Q. This wire gave as its
shadow in the cathode rays a fine black line, bordered by the usual margin of
brighter luminescence. On sending through the wire a current from a small
insulated battery of accumulators no effect was observed until the current had been
so far increased as to make the wire red hot, when its shadow was observed to be
rather wider at the end by which the current left than at the end by which it
entered. On reversing the direction of the current, this effect also changed direction.
If, under these circumstances, the wire was made anodic as a whole by connecting
the insulated battery, or any part of its circuit, to the anode pole of the coil, the
shadow of the wire at once changed to a luminous line (a negative shadow, in fact,
as described in § 1 above), which showed no change on reversing the battery, and
which was unaltered whether the current is on or off. On similarly making the
wire cathodic, its shadow expanded to some 6 millims. wide; and again, no effect
was perceptible on reversing the current, though, apparently, the wire when hot

* A similar observation has been made by Vintant (‘Rendiconti della R. Accademia dei Lincei,’
vol. 5, May 17, 1896), who has investigated the external electrostatic state of Rénrcen tubes and
GeissLeK tubes by the use of electroscopic powders.
