first and second segmentation divisions.

3. In the cross Z. esculentus 2 x E. acutus ? no elimination takes place, while in
the reciprocal HL. acutus 2 X HE. esculentus ¢ an elimination of a few chromosomes
invariably takes place. This elimination, however, cannot be in this case correlated
with any feature in the inheritance, on account of our knowing no definite distinction
between the larvee of these two forms, which we might investigate from this point
of view.

4. In the cross HL. esculentus 9° x HE. miliaris f no elimination takes place, while
in the cross FE. acutus 9 x E. miliaris 2, again, a constant elimination of a few
chromosomes always takes place. These two crosses have always resulted in maternal
inheritance, despite the fact that elimination only takes place in one, 7.e. H. acutus 2
x E. miliaris ~. In this cross we have a definite feature which we can
investigate.

5. In the crosses H. miliaris 2 X E. esculentus ¢ and LE. miliaris 2 x EF. acutus 2,
whose inheritance was maternal in 1909-11 and paternal in 1912, material only of
1912 was examined, so that it is impossible to say if the difference of inheritance
between 1909-11 and 1912 was correlated with differences of elimination.

6. The elimination of chromosomes is connected with the formation of chromatin
vesicles.
