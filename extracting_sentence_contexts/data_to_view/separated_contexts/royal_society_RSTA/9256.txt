The relative efficacy of wringing is no doubt due to purely mechanical action. In
wringing a cylinder down on to a plate the surfaces are not kept parallel, the resistance
encountered is therefore at no time equal to the pressure P (at the least distance between
the surfaces) x area. By tilting the cylinder the resistance can, in fact, be made
vanishingly small. When any part of the cylinder has been forced down it rises under
capillary pressure relatively slowly, as the table (X). p. 67, shows. There is, therefore
a kind of ratchet and pawl action.
