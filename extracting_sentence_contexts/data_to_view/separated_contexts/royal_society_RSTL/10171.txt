Now the result of the far more extended comparison of specimens
which the © Challenger ” collection has enabled me to make, is, that while the © nucleus ”
of the typical O. complanata (in which the eyclical plan of growth, and the © complex ”
structure, show themselves from the very first) is always many times larger than that
of either O. marginalis or O. duplex, the © nucleus” of its snb-typical forms always
bears a very close accordance in size to that of O. duplex, which it resembles also in
the one-sided pullulation of the firs sub-segments from the cireumambient segment,
rendering the earlier zones more or less incomplete, and the position of the © nucleus ”
slightly eccentric. Whether these forms genetically propagate themselves as a race,

_ perpetuating an earlier stage of the evolution of the perfected type, or are merely
individuals which have begun life as © starvelings ” that do not inherit the characteristic
vigour of the type, I have no adequate ground for even s8urmising ; being only able to
affirm this, that as there is no kind of constancy in the stage of growth at which the
*sgmple ” plan gives place to the © complex,” there is nothing to justify a specific differ-
entiation of this &ub-typical variety. That its peculiarity may depend upon conditions
less favourable to the full development of the type, seems to be indicated by the fact
that, whilst the largest and most typical specimens of O. complanata were found in the
rock-pools on the swmmit of the Fiji reef, where they would have the highest tempera-
ture and the greatest abundance of food, the sub-typical specimens presented themselves
chiefly in the collection made by the dredge at 18 fathoms' depth. Theory of Descent. T propose, in the last place, briefly to examine the bearing of the remarkable case
of *descent with modification,” which I have thus detailed, upon the general
© Theory of Dexcent ” and of the © Origin of Species.”
