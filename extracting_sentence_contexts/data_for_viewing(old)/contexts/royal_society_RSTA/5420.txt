among numerous mutually interacting parts. Despite the simplicity of the
governing rules, a rich collective dynamic emerges which is quite distinct from

1at of the individual elements. Hence, the more traditional approach of analysing

1e parts of the system to build a picture of the whole must be re-examined to
deal with such a scenario, where more appropriate conceptual and theoretical
ools become necessary.

At the core of complexity is nonlinearity, directly associated with the lack
of proportionality (hence linearity) between the causes (the forces over and
among the smallest constituents) and the consequences (the phenonemon global
properties). As a matter of fact, nonlinear responses may give place to a variety
of emergent behaviours. Furthermore, in a nonlinear system, the possibility
of chaos—i.e. the strong sensitivity to rather small perturbations and to
slight changes in the initial conditions—may even add a certain degree of
unpredictability and randomness to the dynamics.

From the above observations, it is natural to regard life from the perspective
of complex systems. Indeed, how could one guess what a superior organism can
do and accomplish based only on the study of its basic units, the cells? How
to infer the huge potential transformations in a planet, including entire biome
reshaping, just from an increase in the concentration of a single gas, carbon
dioxide COs, in its atmosphere? How to distinguish the exact individual aspects
defining human ‘culture’? On the one hand, the study of life processes at diverse
