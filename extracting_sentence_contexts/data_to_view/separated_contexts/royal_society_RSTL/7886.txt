Tt will suffice to say that the section of greatest
= £2 8agging does in such cases sometimes come near the middle of the ship ; but in Plate
5 XVI. fig. 7 we have an illustration of the fact that it may come considerably abaft the
S middle ; and there are doubtless cases in which it comes before the middle, its actual
S position being determined, as Professor RAxXKINE himself states, by the position of the
central section of water-borne division. "This sagging-moment, however, is by no means
S *the greatest bending-moment ” experienced by the ship, the distribution of weight and
— buoyancy determining whether the true maximum bending-moment is experienced by
S 8ome section in the fore or after body. I may add, that without accurate calculation
E it is generally possible to tell which body has to bear the greatest strain, by simply ob-
5 8erving at which end the excess of weight is greater.
