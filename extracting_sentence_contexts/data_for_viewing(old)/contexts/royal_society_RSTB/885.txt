as soon as possible. Moreover, it has exhibited not the slightest diminution in
the coloration of the lower side since the day on which it was first brought to the

aquarium, although its lower side has not since that time been exposed to the light
any more than in the case of normal specimens.

Again, Professor GiarD has suggested that the malformed or monstrous ambi
colorate specimens do not swim all their lives vertically, but that they remain longer
in that position than normal specimens, “in any case long enough to allow the
influence of the light to act efficaciously on the side ordinarily colourless.” In fact,
if I understand him rightly* Grarp’s proposed explanation of the condition of the
monstrous Turhot is this:—The Tutbot has a long period of metamorphosis during
which it is pelagic ; in consequence of this it is liable to have its normal metamorphosis
arrested and altered, and in this case its eye does not pass completely into its proper
position, and the relations of the end of the dorsal fin become abnormal. A specimen
so affected remains pelagic for a longer time than usual, the right side is exposed to
light for a longer time than usual, and in consequence remains pigmented instead of
becoming white and unpigmented,

Now if the presence of pigment on the right side of the monstrous Turbot is to be
explained in this way, all other abnormalities of coloration in Flat Fishes ought also’
to be explained as due to the action of light. But even GrArp himself does not
