Formation of budsâ€”Closely following upon the breeding season, the thoracic parts
of each zooid undergo regression. The siphons close, the thorax as a whole con-
denses and there is considerable autolysis. In fact, the whole of the thorax anterior
to the oesophagus eventually disappears, although certain cells accumulate reserve
substances during the period of autolysis and migrate posteriorly. There is thus
a storage of the anterior part of the zooid in the form of trophocytes in the posterior
part. During and subsequent to this posterior migration of trophocytes a series
of transverse constrictions appear in the region of the oesophagus of each zooid.
