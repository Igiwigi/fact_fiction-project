A. J. EWART ON THE ASCENT OF WATER IN TREES.

takes place in accordance with Porseurnirâ€™s formula for the flow through rigid
circular tubes with smooth walls, or whether any peculiarities are shown.*

The trachee are relatively rigid, and the fact that their internal walls are not
smooth should be expected to increase the resistance to flow. Arteries on the other
hand are distensible, but elastic, factors which tend to decrease the resistance to flow
through them. The sap contains few or no suspended particles, and can be regarded
as a very dilute saline solution with a viscosity approximately equal in most cases
to that of water.
