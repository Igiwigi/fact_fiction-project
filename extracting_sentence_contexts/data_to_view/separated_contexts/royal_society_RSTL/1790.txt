Tt will be shown in the subsequent paper, that in the state of
perfect hybernation the respiration is nearly suspended ; the blood mnust,
therefore, be venous. Yet the heart continues to contract, although with
a reptile slowness. The left ventricle is, therefore, veno-contractile, and in
this sense, in fact, sub-reptile. The case forms a sole exception to the law
pointed ont by Harvey, that the left ventricle ceases to contract sooner than
the right. If in the hybernating animal the left ventricle does cease to heat
s00ner than the right, it is only in $0 slight a degree as to be referred to the
greater thickness of its parietes, and the slight degree in which respiration
$till remains.
