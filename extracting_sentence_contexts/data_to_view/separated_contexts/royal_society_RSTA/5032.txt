On treatment with alkaline â€”
pyrogallate, the gas shrank to -32 cub. centim. That this small residue could not be
nitrogen was argued from the fact that it had withstood the prolonged action of the
spark, although mixed with oxygen in nearly the most favourable proportion,

The residue was then transferred to the test-tube with an addition of another
50 cub. centims. of air, and the whole worked up with oxygen as before.
