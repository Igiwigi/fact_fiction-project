Finally, we note that the computation of
measures not involving respiration (i.e. Fs, in figure 6 and Us,x in figure 7) leads to similar
results to those observed for the same measures computed in the presence of D in place of R
(respectively, figures 3 and 4), showing a tendency of the information shared between HP and
systolic pressure to increase when computed in the LF band, and to decrease when computed in
the HF band, with the transition from R to T. The little relevance within the LF band of the measures of multivariate interaction involving
the respiratory volume is due to the known fact that the variability of respiration and its effects
on the variability of HP and arterial pressure are almost exclusively confined in the HF band of
the spectrum [2]. The significant decrease with tilt of the information shared between respiration
and HP (measures Fispj,44, Fr;x, Ur) confirms a number of previous investigations based
on entropy analysis [10,11,16,25] that documented a reduction of cardiorespiratory interactions
during orthostatic stress. Physiologically, these findings reflect the vagal withdrawal and the
dampening of respiratory sinus arrhythmia occurring with tilt [39].
