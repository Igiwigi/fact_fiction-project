it can be hard to appreciate that he was scarcely known outside Cambridge before his ground-
breaking paper on optics was published in 1672 [1]. For over a quarter of a millennium,
generations of scholars have sifted through the surviving evidence about the processes that
enabled Newton to achieve his great discoveries, repeatedly producing new analyses of his
intellectual sources, his experimental acumen and his character. Many historians of the Victorian
era regarded Newton as a supremely rational scientist with impeccable morals, and they would
have been horrified to read some recent accounts that focus on his alchemical research, biblical
exegesis and sexual attitudes. Resistance to considering that a hero may be flawed—or humanly
fallible—still colours modern views, although the same basic facts can often be interpreted in very
different ways.

Newton is reputed to have been a reclusive scholar who shunned controversy, but an
alternative reading of his rise to fame suggests that on those occasions when he did choose to
promote himself, he deployed skills worthy of a professional publicity agent [2]. To advertise
a reflecting telescope he had built in Cambridge in 1669, he emphasized to his colleagues that it
could magnify 150 times despite being only 6 inches long—and, he added, he had cast and ground
the mirror himself from a home-made alloy (figure 1). It seems likely that Newton unobtrusively
fanned rumours about his new invention, until within a couple of years his former mathematics
tutor at Cambridge, Isaac Barrow, had arranged for it to be demonstrated to the Fellows of the
Royal Society. The astonishingly small but powerful telescope caused a minor sensation. Having
already succeeded Barrow as Lucasian professor, Newton was elected to a Fellowship on 11
