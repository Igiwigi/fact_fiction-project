For similar and obvious reasons I assign to the rays separating the component lamine
© of the woody wedges the title of 8econdary medullary rays. They are formed subse-
2 quently to the others, and, as in the case of Exogens, their number in the Calamite con-
S tinues to increase as long as the wedges containing them continue to grow. All the
< facts T have detailed justify the conclusion published in some of my previous memoirs,

S that in this woody zone of the Calamite we have a true exogenous growth ; whether we
regard its intimate organization or its genesis, we are brought to this decision. There

-2 is a peculiarity in the exterior of this zone not to be overlooked. In his monograph

E already referred to, Mr. Bixxer figures a decorticated stem, the decorticated exterior of

5, which is marked by strong longitudinal ribs and furrows, with a thickened node.
