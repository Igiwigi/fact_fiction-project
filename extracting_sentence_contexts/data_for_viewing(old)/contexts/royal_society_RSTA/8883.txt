experimental determinations are reliable. Curves I. and II. of fig. 17 are seen to be
very much alike and considerably different from fig. 18. The data in fig. 18 which are
here referred to are the experimental points marked thus ©. The meaning of the
crosses and the full curve on this diagram will be explained below. However, all three
have certain important points in common. They show a distribution, such that for
low energies the number within a given range dE = edV varies only slowly with E

(or V), whereas for high energies, 7.e., further to the right on each diagram, it falls off
very rapidly. Moreover, the shape of the rapidly falling part of the curve is much the
same in each case, and in fact on this part of the curves the ordinates are very nearly
proportional to e~*’, where « is a constant for any one curve. This can be seen if
the logarithms of the ordinates are plotted against V when the points fall very nearly
on a straight line. On the other hand, the slowly varying part of the curve shows
distinct indications of possessing a maximum in fig. 18, whereas in curves I. and II.
it falls away continuously from the initial value. This disagreement at low energies
suggests trouble from the factors referred to above and points to the desirability of
keeping for the present to the high energy part of the curve in trying to find an inter-
pretation of the results. The outstanding feature of this part of the curve is the fact
that it falls away very approximately in proportion to the factor e~*’, which at once
suggests a Maxwell distribution of energy among the electrons, since this distribution
is dominated by a factor of this form. I have therefore calculated the currents which
would be obtained on the assumption that the energy of the electrons is a Maxwell
