change in precipitation results from the competition between this reduction of precipitation and
the increase in frequency of deep convective regimes [49]. Also, the comparison of the two
IPSL model versions shows that drier conditions in the Sahel region induces drier soils that
prevent the development of vegetation and thereby limits local recycling and the northward
inland penetration of the monsoon flow in IPSL-CM5B-LR. The changes in precipitation over
the Sahel are thus smaller in IPSL-CM5B-LR than in IPSL-CM5A-LR, despite the fact that the new
atmospheric physics tend to produce more intense precipitation in the continental ITCZ.

The differences in the location of the vegetation feedback in the different climate models
and between the two versions of the IPSL model strongly suggest that the improvement of the
representation of the ITCZ location in the PI control simulation is a prerequisite to properly trigger
the vegetation feedback. Large-scale circulation and the interhemispheric contrast seem to be key
factors. Local recycling and the coupling between the land surface and the atmospheric boundary
layer is also an important factor in triggering precipitation [55]. This relationship and how it is
represented in climate models also needs further attention before we can fully assess the role of
the vegetation feedback in West Africa during the Holocene.
