In A. punctulata oculars I, If and III are the first plates to appear in the echinus-
rudiment, and are, from the beginning, associated with the corresponding terminal
tube-feet. As the echinus-rudiment enlarges, oculars IV and V are soon brought each
into intimate association with a terminal tube-foot, as represented in fig. 3.

Bach inter-ambulacrum consists of three well-formed plates (fig. 3, 1, 2 and 3); the
median one extends beyond the lateral ones aborally as well as adorally. Of the ten
ambulacral plates (fig. 3, a and b) those of the Ia, Ia, 111b, 1Va, Vb series are somewhat
larger than the remaining five although the difference is not so pronounced as in Echinus
miliaris (GORDON, 1926, a, p. 266, fig. 3). The lantern of Aristotle has been omitted
from the diagram, and the primordia of the ten large buccal plates have not yet
appeared. Apart from the fact that ambulacral plate Ia is larger than IIb and that
genital 1 is larger than genital 2, the symmetry about the axis AB is complete. The
test is very asymmetrical about Lovin’s axis CD.

Fig. 3 taken in conjunction with figs. 4 and 5 is intended to elucidate the composition
of the entire test at metamorphosis. The specimen represented in figs. 4 and 5 was
macerated in an 8 per cent. solution of potassium hydroxide until the ten ambulacral
plates separated from each other when the treated imago was transferred to distilled
water. The five terminal tube-feet (indicated by dotted circles in fig. 3, ¢.ft.), with their
simple calcareous discs, have been omitted in fig. 4. The first pair of ambulatory tube-
feet had already been budded off from the radial water vessel, but no traces of the
compound discs were as yet apparent. In fig. 5 the two slender triradiate spines on
each ocular plate have been omitted.
