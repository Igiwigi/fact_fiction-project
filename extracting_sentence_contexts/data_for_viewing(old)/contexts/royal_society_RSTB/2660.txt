show the same essential features as the reef Poritidee and may, I think, he safely
included with them as an independent group, to which I give the name of Porosa.
There are, too, certain ancient forms which from the descriptions seem to have much
in common with Poritide. I refer to the genus Thecia and its allies. The ancestry
of the Spongiomorphids and Poritids will have still to be thoroughly investigated.
So far as my reading goes, the Theciidee appear to be at least close allies.

Tt comes to be a question how far the recent Poritide are related with the recent
Madreporids. The external signs on which Epwarps and Hatmu chiefly founded
their group of M. perforata, including in it Eupsammids, Madreporids, and Poritids,
carry no longer any real weight. Porosity of the septum may be seen to a certain
extent in a few Astrids, most Fungids and Eupsammids, and in all Poritids,
whereas the septum of Madreporids is, as a matter of fact absolutely compact. Such
a feature only leads away from the fundamental laws of coral structure.

A sure indication of relationship between the Poritide and the ccenenchymatous
group generally, is afforded hy the peripheral arrangement of the skeletal elements.
The introduction of new costal trabecule in the wall, the multiplication of coste as
the distance from the wall increases, the variation in the area covered by the
coenenchymate skeleton, and even in its precise form, are all features which show
