be readily seen by any one who will pernse the two essays with a view to a com-
parison, that they differ essentially in subject and object. M. Quamegraces' chief
aim is to define the visceral cavity; he adds only a few general observations with
reference to the physiological relations and functions of the fluid contents. He has
not attempted to resolve the problem of its histological characters. His conclusions

are not based upon observyed facts, but upon general views. He makes no allusion.
whatever to the relations which subsist between the ehylaqueous system and that of
the true blood; he has not defined the difference in the mechanism of solid nutrition
as it occurs respectively under the agency of these two orders of fluids. M. Quarae-
FAGES has Seized no one clue to the demonstration of the capital law of structure, viz.
that the system of the blood-proper only first appears in the series at the Echinoder-
mata. Unguided by this great and novel principle, he could not perceive that a
blood-proper system could not exist, as it was not required below the Echinodermata.
He affords no proof of having known that the chylaqueous system of fluid is governed
physiologically and chemically by laws distinct from, though not less definite than
those which regulate that of the true blood. He has accumulated no individual ob-
servations il[ustrative of the histological characters of the morphotic elements, either
of the chylaqueous fluid, or the true blood. M, QuaTReracts appears also to bave
