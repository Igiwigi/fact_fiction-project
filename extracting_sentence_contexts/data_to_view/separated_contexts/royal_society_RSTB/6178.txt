They had a mean diameter of 309 u. The connective tissue reticulum in them was
better developed and the luteal cells did not appear so plump as in the larger ones ;
than which they appeared to be slightly older in consequence. It is clear that
either (a) all the corpora lutea formed a single set resulting from a single ovulation
or (b) that they formed two sets of 3 + 4 and 5 + 5 respectively, resulting from two
consecutive ovulations. The first alternative is supported by the fact that ten
embryos and one degenerating ovum were present in the uterus. Even if it were
assumed that the embryos were derived from the ten ova presumably liberated at
the second ovulation the degenerating ovum could only be accounted for by assuming
its persistence from the previous ovulation. Moreover, no other animal was
obtained with more than one recent set of corpora lutea.
