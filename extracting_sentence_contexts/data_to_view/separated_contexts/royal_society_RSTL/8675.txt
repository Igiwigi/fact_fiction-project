Micros. Sci. 1874). The fact that the development of the © enamel-cells ” bears a direct relation to the
thickness of the enamel to be formed also lends support to the view (which on other
grounds I am strongly inclined to support) that the enamel is formed by the direct con-
version of the enamel-cells into the hard tissue. It is difficult otherwise to account for the contrast presented by the length of the
cells in the different parts of the enamel-organ ; and T may add that the aggregate
length of the cells and the enamel cap already formed in fig. 8 jus makes up the
thickness of the enamel cap upon an average completed tooth.
