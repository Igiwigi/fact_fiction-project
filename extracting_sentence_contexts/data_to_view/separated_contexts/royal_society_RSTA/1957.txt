In the appli-
cation of this the frequent link modification must be allowed for, as well as the effect
of observation errors. Consequently separations deviating by not more than two
or three units from the values determined above are admitted. As a fact, this will
exclude a number of real link connections as well as inelude a certain number of
pseudo ones. But by limiting the deviations to these small amounts the conclusions
drawn will be more reliable. Sounpine Data.
