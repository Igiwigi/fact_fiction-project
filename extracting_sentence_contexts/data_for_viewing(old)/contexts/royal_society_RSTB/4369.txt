form a portion of Nasmyth’s membrane, are seen attached to the follicle in many

places and in others partially detached from it, and projecting into the space
originally occupied by the enamel (fig. A). Near the junction of the connective tissue
of the follicle with the dentine the enamel organ is seen in contact with the wall
of the follicle and definitely terminates at the point where the enamel ceases
(figs. 5 and 8).

That this is the actual termination of the enamel is shown by the fact that it is

here in contact with the first deposited cement which forms a very thin layer over
the dentine, and osteoblasts can be seen in contact with it. :

In a section of the developing tooth of a mouse (mus decumanus), one of the
animals investigated by von Brunn, in which the enamel had reached its downward
limit and the root was in process of formation, the enamel organ is seen to definitely
terminate at the point where the connective tissue of the follicle is attached to the
tooth. In this case a portion of the enamel has escaped thorough decaleification
