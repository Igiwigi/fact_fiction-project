Polar cells were never observed. â€” It will be convenient to describe first those changes which are visible from the
Sxterior, leaving to the next section an account of the corresponding internal changes

Su cog with a discussion of their significance. The 8egmentation of the egg in Renilla is remarkable for the surprising amount of
individual variation of which it is capable. $0 great is this variation that it is safe to

the variations may be arranged in a definite series, ome of them are 80 irregular that
they seem to follow no definite law.
