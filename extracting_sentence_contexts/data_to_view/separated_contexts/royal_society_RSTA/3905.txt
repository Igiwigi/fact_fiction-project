These chilled alloys gave us much valuable information, but we found that some of
the transformations, especially those of the C, D and H temperatures, required a
period of at least some hours to complete themselves, and that the cooling antecedent
to most of our chills had not in general been slow enough to allow of complete

transformation. In fact, when the cooling is spontaneous, that is, brought about by
extinguishing the gas and allowing the ingot to cool in the furnace, although the
total time spent in cooling may be considerable, yet the rate of cooling at the higher
temperatures will always be rapid. We therefore made a series of chills, preceded by
a cooling which was very slow from the freezing-point of the alloy down to the
moment of chilling. We took especial care to ensure that the time of cooling
through a range of a few degrees above and below the critical point C or D should
last several hours.
