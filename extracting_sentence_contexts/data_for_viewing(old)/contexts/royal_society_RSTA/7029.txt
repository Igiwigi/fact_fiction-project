of the anticathode from which the radiation is emitted. In all cases, except that of
Li at the highest temperature, the metal of the anticathode remains solid. It will be
seen that the effects of an increased temperature are twofold: (a) a broadening out
of the edges, which in the case of Al obliterates a feature of the band, and (6) a shift
of the mean point of the edge which occurs towards longer wave-lengths in all cases,
except that of the alkali metals, for which the mean point remains practically stationary.

In the case of liquid lithium (for which the melting-point could be accurately
gauged by the flowing of the surface of the anticathode) it will be seen that there is
no marked difference in the shape of the curve from that emitted by solid lithium at
a slightly lower temperature. However, a very careful study of many photometer
traces has convinced us that the slight difference to be observed in figure 4 is genuine.
This consists in the fact that the curve for liquid lithium is more smoothly rounded

(and that in consequence its maximum occurs at a shorter wave-length) than for solid
lithium.


THE SOFT X-RAY SPECTROSCOPY OF SOLIDS 113

In the case of insulators and semi-conductors, the considerable diffuseness of the
false edge, and the low intensity of the sharp short wave-length limit makes the bands
relatively insensitive to temperature effects from a practical point of view. In the
case of Si, experiments with the anticathode temperature varying between 110 and
600Â° K failed to show any noticeable difference in the band shape. This does not
