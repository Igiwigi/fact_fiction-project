part of the outer bulb passed across
the vacuum, and attracted the pith
ball (ï¬†uspended in air), The sphe-
rical 8hell of vacuum across which
the heat passed, therefore, produced
no change of action, but simply
behaved like an extra thick glass
bulb. This experiment bears upon
the speculation in par. 81 of my
former paper on this subject.

99, Having succeeded in proving
the fact of repulsion resulting from
radiation, I was desirous of getting
some quantitative estimations of the
forces under examination. A pen-
dulum-apparatus was constructed as
shown in fig. 6. A wide glass tube
(4b) has fused to it a narrower tube
(cd), about 40 inches long; & is a
