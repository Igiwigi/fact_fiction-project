On the other hand, it has been

denied by HALLER, MORGAGNI, BoyER, SABATIER, CHAUSSIER, PROCHASKA, Vice D'AzyR,
Duxas, Bicxar, RoLaNDo, MuxRo, DESMOULINS, and more recently by STILLINGS. At
the present day the balance of opinion is decidedly in fayour of a decussation, although
the late microscopical researches of STILLING may have added some weight to the oppo-
site 8ideh. I am prepared, however, to place the fact beyond all possibility of doubt;
for a cursory inspection of my preparations is sufficient to show that a complete and
complicated decussation actually takes place. But still the real composition and ele-
mentary structure of the pyramids, as I shall now proceed to show, has not hitherto
been accurately described.

(10.) Until the commencement of the present century, it was believed by those who
admitted the fact in question, that the anterior' pyramids are formed by a decussation
between the anterior columns of the spinal chord. Ro8ENTHAL || corrected this error by
pointing out the important fact that the fibres of decussation proceed from the lateral,
columns; but at the same time he thought that from the latter the whole of the pyra-
mids are formed as new or separate structures by running along the fissxure between
the anterior columns, which they thrust aside in their course.
