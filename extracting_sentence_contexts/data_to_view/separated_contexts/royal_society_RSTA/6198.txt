Thus, Ok(T) serves


as a measure of how close T is to being [1}-sound: the larger O}(T) is, the harder one needs to
search to find a counterexample to the /1}-soundness of T. The authors begin by recalling various concepts and results from the theory of ptykes. While
these facts were already explicitly or implicitly covered in the work of Girard [61] and Girard-
Ressayre [62], proofs are included for convenience. Seven classification theorems are proved, all
recasting various soundness properties of T in terms of whether certain dilators D belong to O}(T). As mentioned in the article, these results all extend to the other classes 1} without much trouble.
