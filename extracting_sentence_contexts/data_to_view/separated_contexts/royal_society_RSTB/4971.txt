The
occurrence of an occasional spine with six prongs suggests that, at some period in the
history of these primitive triradiate spines, each of the three vertical processes divided
into two to give a hexaradiate form. The tetraradiate spine may have been derived
from such a hexaradiate by the elimination (secondarily) of division in the case of two
of the projections. The fact that the primordia of these spines appear in advance of those of the typical
spines (see p. 264) lends weight to the view that they are ancestral forms precociously
developed. On the other hand, they may be larval modifications. These tetraradiate spines bear a somewhat superficial resemblance to the spines of an
Asteroid, especially as regards the absence of a definite tubercle on the plates to which
they are atached.
