The coated glass. plates of Beocaria,strongly adhere to
each other when oppositely charged, /and retain their charges
on being separated. This fact affords a distinct analogy to the
subject ; different particles 'in combining must still be sup-
posed to preserve their peculiar states of energy.

In the present early stage of the investigation, it would be
improper to place' unbounded confidence in this hypothesis ;
but it seems naturally to arise from the facts,-and to coincide
with the laws of affinity, s0 ably, developed by modern
chemists; and - the general application, of it may be easily
made. 4

Supposing two bodies, the particles of which are in different
electrical states, and. those states sufficiently exalted to give
them an attractive force superior to . the power of aggre-
gation, a combination, would take place: which would be more
or less intense according as the energies were more or less
perfectly balanced ; and the change of properties would. be
correspondently proportional.
