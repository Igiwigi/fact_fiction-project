DDEs are infinite-dimensional dynamical systems and their analysis generally poses analytical
and numerical challenges. Nonetheless, the theory of DDEs with a finite number of constant
delays is well developed [32,33]. In fact, the bifurcation theory of constant-delay DDEs is analogue
to that of ordinary differential equations: their solutions depend smoothly on parameters and
initial conditions, and their linearizations around equilibria and periodic solutions have at
most finitely many unstable eigendirections. Furthermore, advanced numerical tools for their
simulation and bifurcation analysis are available and have been applied successfully to analyse
models arising in various applications, for example, see [34] and references therein. In [20,35], we conducted a bifurcation analysis of the GZT model (1.1) in order to understand
how it is able to produce such rich dynamics.
