The last two columns of this Table, which exhibit respectively the actual amount of
Nitrogen not recoverable by the. soda-lime process in the substance after decompoxition,
and the percentage proportion of this loss upon the Nitrogen submitted to experiment,
are the most important to consider for our present purpose.

With one exception (the gain of Nitrogen in which is quite within the range of the
error of analysis), all the experiments point to the fact, that a part of the Nitrogen of
decomposing organic matter passes into a state in which it cannot be estimated by the
s0da-lime process. Neither did it exist as nitric acid. There appears, therefore, to be
an evolution of free Nitrogen.

It is not a little remarkable, that although s0 large a proportion of the total Nitrogen
present is lost, doubtless passing off as free Nitrogen, yet scarcely a trace of ammonia
was given off from the mass; for the oxalic acid in the bulb-apparatus C was, in each
case, separately rendered alkaline with caustic potash and distilled, the distillate being
collected and examined quantitatively for ammonia, when, in only one case—that of the

Bean-meal and Pumice—was there any ammonia indicated, and then only equal in
amount to 00002 gramme Nitrogen. This was the case, notwithstanding that the
