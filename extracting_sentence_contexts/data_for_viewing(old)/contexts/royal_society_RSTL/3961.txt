which the laws of this phenomenon follow. Comparing the muscular and the proper
current together, we find that the influence of the different circumstances affects hoth
currents equally. Thus it is that both the muscular and the proper current vary in
the same sense with the variation of the temperature of the medium in which the
frogs live. Sulphuretted hydrogen diminishes the proper current just as it does
the muscular current. The same may be said of the effects produced upon the
proper current by the different degrees of activity of the respiration and of the circu-
lation of the blood. I shall not here mention all the numbers obtained in the expe-
riments recently performed upon the proper current of the frog. I will merely say
that I followed up every one of the experiments on the muscular current referred to
in this memoir, with another experiment on the proper current, composing the pile
with the legs which remained after having prepared the frogs for the muscular cur-
rent. After s0 great a number of facts, I do not hesitate in repeating what I have
8aid in page 127 of my Treatise : © comparing one with the other the circumstances
which exert an influence over the muscular and over the proper current, they may be
said entirely to resemble one another, and that that which increases or weakens the
intensity of one of these currents, produces the same effect upon the other.” Two
points, however, still remain to be cleared up. Do the circumstances which affect
these two currents operate upon both in a like degree ? or in other words, does that
cireumstance which diminishes as well the muscular as the proper current of the frog,
act proportionally in that diminution ?

T had found in my first experiments, that comparing two piles, one consisting of
half thighs of frogs, the other of entire or halves of frogs, s0 as to obtain the proper
current, the signs produced by the latter pile continued longer than those evinced by
