longer a true sphere with which we have to deal. If, however, we cut a true sphere
of radius « out of the spheroid (leaving out &o;), then by a proper choice of gurface
actions, the tidal problem may be reduced to finding the state of flow in a true sphere
under the action of (i) an external tide-generating influence, (ii) the attraction of the

true sphere, and of the positive and negative matter filling the space Eo;, but, (iii)
guhject to certain surface forces.

Since (i) and (it) together constibute a bodily force, the problem only differs from
that of Sir W. TromsoN in the fact that there are forces acting on the surface of the
sphere.

Now as we are only going to consider small deviations from sphericity, these surface
actions will be of 8mall amount, and an approximation will be permissiþle.

It is clear that rigorously there is tangential action* between the layer of matter
Eo; and the true sphere, bub by far the larger part of the action is normal, and is
simply the weight (either positive or negative) of the matter which lies above or
below any point on the surface of the true sphere.

Thus, in order to reduce the earth to sphericity, the appropriate surface action js
a normal traction equal to —gwEo;, where g is gravity at the surface, and w is the
