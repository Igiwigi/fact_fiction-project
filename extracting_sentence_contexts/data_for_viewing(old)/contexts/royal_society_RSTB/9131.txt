‘Brain circuitry outside the synaptic cleft’. 1. Introduction

N-methyl p-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) have long been of major interest to
Subject Areas: neuroscientists owing to their multiple implications in neuronal physiology
neuroscience during development and adulthood. Following the seminal discovery of

long-lasting synaptic plasticity by Bliss & Lomo [1], NMDARs have been
known for their key role in long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term
depression (LTD) of synaptic transmission [2]. However, because these gluta-
mate-gated ion channels are highly permeable to calcium, they not only relay
glycine, excitotoxicity a physiological signal into neurons, but can also trigger intracellular signalling
cascades that can ultimately lead to cell death. In fact, the phenomenon of exci-
totoxicity [3] and its causal link with excessive glutamate release [4] were
described years before the existence of synaptic plasticity was established, but
NMDARs were only demonstrated to be the main source of calcium responsible
for glutamate-induced excitotoxicity in the late 1980s [5-7]. Ever since, these
receptors have been renowned for their duality. They are both essential and
potentially harmful receptors whose activity needs to be finely and tightly con-
trolled. Such regulation is achieved by many intracellular and extracellular
factors, including intracellular partners, magnesium block, endogenous allo-
steric modulators, as well as agonist and co-agonist binding. Interestingly,
many of these regulatory actions are highly sensitive to the subunit composition
of the receptor [8,9]. Along with the development of subunit-specific pharma-
cological antagonists, evidence for specific roles of NMDAR subtypes has
