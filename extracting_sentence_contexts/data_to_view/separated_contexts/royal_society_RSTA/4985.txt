which involve only the three undetermined quantities

Yis> Vise Yo

From these five equations we can eliminate the three quantities

Vis Via Yow

and thus obtain two independent relations between the coefficients of V,. These are
the two conditions that the coefficients must satisfy in order that a redundant form
may be possible. Since also these coefficients are the several co-axial minors of the determinant

we establish the fact that these co-axial minors are connected by two relations or
syzygies. Thus

o,= 2;

and assuming the satisfaction of these two conditions we can solve the equations so
as to express
Yis» Yiss Yu

as functions of the coefficients of V,. Solving these equations and writing

Phos = Piss — Pi: P23 — P2Pis — PsPia + 2P\PoPs,
we find
