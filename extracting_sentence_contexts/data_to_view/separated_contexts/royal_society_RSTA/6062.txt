As previously warned, this does not necessarily mean that the obtained
expression is a physical result, but at least is a meaningful, finite, expression. As it is well known
from renormalization theory [114], the price for the finiteness of any renormalized result is its
necessary dependence on an arbitrary mass scale, jz in this case. In point of fact, this is the
essence of the RG [114-116]. However, as noted before, scale dependencies (including explicit and
implicit) must cancel out in the full effective action of the theory since by construction we started
from the bare theory, which is of course jz-independent (RG-invariant). Therefore, explicit changes
of (within a given renormalization scheme) in one sector of the theory must be compensated


by explicit and/or implicit changes of in another sector (e.g. from the implicit running of
the couplings and fields).
