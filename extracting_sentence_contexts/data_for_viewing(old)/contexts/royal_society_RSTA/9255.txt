When the curves were calculated with the experimentally determined luminosity
factors of Ly : Le : Ly = 1:2+88:0-17, the areas were as nearly equal as mattered
in practice, but in order to get a higher order of arithmetical consistency, they were
recalculated with the slightly reduced values of 2-858 for Lg, and 0-169 for Ly, which
gave areas as nearly equal as could be determined by careful planimetry.

The curves were then transformed to the reference primaries and are given in Table 111
for the N.P.L. standard white light, and also for the equal-energy spectrum, in which
form they are best adapted for general work. These equal-energy curves give a
luminosity summation identical with the standard visibility curve.

The conclusion to be drawn from the fact that the curves fulfil the three criteria
of fitting the experimentally determined trichromatic coefficients ; fitting the normal
visibility curve; and having luminosity factors for the primaries which agree with
the independently determined values for these factors as closely as such determinations

can at present be made, is that the mean visibility curve of the seven observers is
sufficiently close to the standard curve that their colorimetric results do not differ to
a material extent from those of an eye accurately represented, as regards its visibility
function, by that curve.
