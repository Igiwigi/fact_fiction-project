accomplish, I hope, in testing the action of humid air, that the use of the silvered
closed with polished plates of rocksalt, on which no trace of visible moisture
deposited, will be conceded to me. This tube involves the use of a gource of heat,
small dimensions. The lime light, though fulfilling this condition, is not 8uita
because of the high refrangibility of its heat. The incandescent platinum spiral woul,
be better ; still, the radiation from this source is but feebly absorbed by the aqueous
vapour taken up by air at ordinary temperatures. The oxyhydrogen flame fulfils the
required conditions best.* Tt has the advantage of high temperature and low re-
frangibility, while the fact that its heat, as coming from aqueous vapour, is absorbed
with special energy, by aqueous vapour, is also a strong recommendation. Tn the
Bakerian Lecture for 1864, IT have illustrated this point. It was then shown that
when a platinum spiral, rendered incandescent by a voltaic current, had 5*8 per cent,
of its heat absorbed by un-dried air, a hydrogen flame had from 17 to 20 per cent, of
its heat absorbed. The mere plunging of a platinum spiral into the flame caused the
absorption to fall from 17 per cent. to 8'6 per cent. Hence my reason for choosing a
hydrogen flame in the present instance.

Dry air and humid air being caused to occupy the experimental tube in 8uecession,
both of them were compared with the radiation through the tube when very perfectly
exhausted by a Blaxcar's pump. The following results were obtained.
