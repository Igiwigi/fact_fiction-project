the former discordance in our views, since in three or four Guineaworms of different
8izes which I have since examined, I have found a difference in the degree of develoy
ment presented by their contained young ; and in one animal I found them in a more
advanced stage than I had ever before seen, displaying the intestine communicating
with the exterior by an anal orifice in the very situation indicated by CartTER—that is
to say, slightly above the level of the lateral sacculi (Plate XX VII. fig. 22, a). Thus the
young which I had before examined and figured, in which the intestine ended czcally,
were less mature individuals, and 80 exemplified what appears to be the usnal course in
the development of the intestinal canal in higher members of the animal kingdom. Þ
exists first in the form of a cxcal tube which gradually elongates, 80 as to approxima
and ultimately unite with an anal orifice commencing independently as an infolding 0!
the parietes of the body. That the young I first examined were less mature is al
indicated by the fact that the measurements I gave of them were below those given of the
young Dracunculi by several other observers. In these last more developed animals i
which I have been enabled to detect the anal orifice, I also recognized rudimentary cone
ditions of the two head papillz, and, more interesting till, discovered what has not yet”
been detected in the adult animal, in the form of a distinct channel through the integument
in the ventral region of the body, about 447” from its anterior extremity (Plate xXXVIE
fig. 24, a). May not this be the commencement of one of the forms of the ventral exx
cretory apparatus met with in the Nematoids? Whether, however, it is the outlet of ®
future rudimentary saccule, or of two longitudinal vessels which are to exist in the lateral
regions of the body, cannot be said. In the adult Dracunculus I bave now recognized
