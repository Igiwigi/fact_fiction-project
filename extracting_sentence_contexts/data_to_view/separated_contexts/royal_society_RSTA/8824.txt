It means
an increased displacement 26, in each alternate line. But if the observation errors are
small, there appear to be indications of simultaneous displacements in the f sequences
as well as on the limit. In fact a similar phenomenon is indicated in the two next
orders though naturally some elements are wanting. A precisely similar connection
is shown by AgS (3), [IV., p. 382], in a still more striking and regular series of
changes. The elucidation of the laws governing displacements is of the first
importance and should be one of the immediate objects of investigation.
