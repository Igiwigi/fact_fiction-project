Haem also coordinates regulation of metabolism with
the circadian clock via the Rev-erb haem sensors [46]. For haem
binding, a haem-regulatory motif (HRM) is found in bacteria
and eukaryotic systems [47]. In fact, HAP1 and Bach] contain 7
and 6 HRMs, respectively, while Rev-erb binds to haem with
non-classical HRM. In bHLH110 and BOA, we could not detect
any classic HRM, so haem may bind to distinct domains if they
really bind to haem. It is interesting to note that in mammalian
cells, haem biosynthesis is circadian-regulated and several
components including Rev-erb bind haem [46].
