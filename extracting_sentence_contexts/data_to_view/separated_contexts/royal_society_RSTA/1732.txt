While the direct effect of nonlocality on the Biermann battery is interesting the indirect effect
of the flux limiter is more important. There is no single value for the thermal flux limiter f which
accurately captures kinetic effects. The fact then that MHD simulations of the Biermann battery
should depend so strongly on f therefore suggests that care should be exercised interpreting the
results of such simulations. For example, MHD simulations of indirect drive ICF suggest that
large magnetic fields may be generated by the Biermann battery but the effect of the flux limiter
(f =0.15 was used) on these predictions was not explored [4]. Recently particle in cell kinetic
simulations have been used to demonstrate further departures from simple MHD modelling, for
example the formation of filaments due to the Weibel instability [24,25].
