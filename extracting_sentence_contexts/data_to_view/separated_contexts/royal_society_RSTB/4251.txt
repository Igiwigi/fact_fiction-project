Hassall’s corpuscles are well marked. A
typical imbedded epithelial body is present, and in addition there occurs a smaller
epithelial mass whose ends are not sharply marked off from the adjoining thymus
tissue. The fact that in some of the isolated nodules of thymus tissue the epithelial
cells of the reticulum appear to have undergone hypertrophy suggests that this
mass may have been formed from the reticulum after the withdtawal of the
thymus cells. Epithelial body 111 on the left side lies dorsally to the internal carotid, shortly in
front of its origi. It measures 2°5 x 2mm.
