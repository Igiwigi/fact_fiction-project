that the colourless SO, ion following the yellow CrO, ion through a jelly tube over-
takes it continuously, so that there is no boundary visible, but only a gradual fading
out of colour. A similar result was got also by following the blue Cu ions with
colourless Zn ions through the tube: again there was no boundary, but the colour

adually faded out. These cases probably illustrate the non-fulfilment of the con-

SHition that the foremost ion must be by nature the faster.

Ee Theory of the Moving Boundary.

“a Itis easy to deduce the behaviour of the ions on each side of a moving boundary
from the fundamental equation given at the beginning of this paper, and from the fact
Sthat the visible (coloured) ion keeps pace with the invisible (colourless) ion in front of it.
Ee Let the boundary in question be that between visible and invisible cations travel-
ching with the current and matched by invisible anions, all of one kind, travelling
“Fagainst it. Let the symbols be used with the same meaning as before, but let those
‘Sapplying to the coloured part of the jelly be marked with dashes to distinguish them
Ebro those applying to the colourless jelly on the other side of the boundary.

‘3 Since equal currents cross all sections of the tube at the same time,
