North of these localities, E. nigrum occurs on Cannock Chase and several places in north
Staffordshire (Bagnall 1901), becoming abundant on the Pennines of north Derbyshire, and
occurring in all vice-counties to the north, except south-east Yorkshire, where it may once
have grown (Cheetham & Sledge 1941). It occurs abundantly throughout Scotland where
it descends to sea-level; it is widespread in Ireland. E. hermaphroditum (Lange) Hagerup is now known to occur in this country, and some of
the more northern localities for E. nigrum may in fact refer to this species: it has been
recorded from Wales (Snowdonia), northern England and from several parts of Scotland. Outside Great Britain it ranges considerably farther north, to 79° N., as opposed to 63° N.,
and also occurs on the high alps of Europe. E. nigrum is known from the Irish late-Glacial at Ballybetagh, near Dublin, zones II and
III (Jessen & Farrington 1938).
