with difficulties, and although the author has been singularly fortunate in meeting with
specimens in a good tate of preservation, when compared with most hitherto described,

still his information is confined to two plants. These, no doubt, have contributed by their
remains in a great measure to form the two seams of coal in which they were found, as
is evident from the abundance of Sigillaria-roots now found in floors of the beds. In
addition to this fact, the Halifax Hard or Gannister seam yields the Sigillaria vascularis
as by far the most, common plant found in it.

The large specimens Nos. 2 & 3, now described and figured, some persons may doubt
as being the older forms of the Sigillaria vascularis described by me some years since in
the Geological Society's Journal previously quoted, as well as the medium-sized specimen
No. 8 given in Plate XXXV. fig. 5 of this memoir; but the one has been traced

Structure is unquestionably the same both in the large and small plants, after making
<due allowance for the greater age of the former.
Z 'The general opinion of botanists and geologists, that Sigillaria was a hollow and
Szucculent plant, no doubt arose from the flat specimens generally found compressed into
