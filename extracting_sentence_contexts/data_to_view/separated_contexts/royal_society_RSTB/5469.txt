It involves ordinarily only the lower parts of these structures and is the muscular
component of the female sexual orgasm. It may spread, however, presumably
as waves of antiperistalsis, up the ducts even to their ovarian ends. This, at least,
is the conclusion that I draw from the fact that at copulation rat sperms pass
from the vagina of this animal to the apex of its uterine horn in less than two
minutes (HARTMAN and Batt, 1930) and that fully formed eggs in the hen may
be discharged through the infundibulum into the birdâ€™s abdominal cavity (PEARL and
Curtis, 1914). These ducts also exhibit typical peristalsis, in that waves course over them from their
deep ends next the ovaries outward to the exterior. Such waves are the obvious means
of moving large eggs like those of the tortoise and of the pigeon through the length
of the ducts.
