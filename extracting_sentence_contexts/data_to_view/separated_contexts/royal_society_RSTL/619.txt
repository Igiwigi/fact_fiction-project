180 Count RumForD's Enquiry concerning the Nature of Heat,

It has been shown, that the warmth of clothing depends much
on the pol:s√æ of the surface of the substance of which it is made ;
and hence we may conclude that, in choosing the colour of our
winter garments, those dyes should be avoided which tend most
to destroy that polish : and, as a white surface reflects more
light than an equal surface, equally polished, of any other
colour, there is much reason to think that white garments are
warmer than any other, in cold weather, They are universally
considered as the coolest that can be worn, in very hot weather,
and especially when a person is exposed to the direct rays
of the sun; and, if they are well calculated to reflect calo-
rific rays in summer, they must be equally well calculated to
reflect those frigorific rays by which we are cooled and annoyed
in winter,

I have found, by direct and decisive experiments, (of which
an account will hereafter be given to this Society,) that garments
of fur are much warmer, in cold weather, when worn with the
fur or hair outwards, than when it is turned inwards. 'Is not
this a proof that we are kept warm by our clothing, not s0 much
by confining our heat, as by keeping off those frigorific rays
which tend to cool us? The fine fur of beasts, being a highly polished substance, is
well calculated to reflect those rays which fall on it; and,
if the body were kept warm by the rays which proceed from
it being reflected back upon it, there is reason to think, that
a fur garment would be warmest when worn with the hair in-
wards; but, if it be by reflecting and turning away the frigoritic
rays from external (colder) bodies, that we are kept warm
by our clothes in cold weather, we might naturally expect, that

a pellisse would be warmest when worn with the hair outwards,
as I haye found it to be in fact. The point here in question is by no means a matter of small
importance; for, until the principles of the warmth of clothing
be understood, we shall not be able to take our measures with
certainty, and with the least possible trouble and expence, for
defending ourselves against the inclemencies of the seasons, and
making ourselves comfortable in all climates,

The fur of several delicate animals becomes white in winter,
in cold countries; and that of the bears which inhabit the polar
regions, is white in- all seasons. These last are exposed alter-
nately, in the open air, to the most intense cold, and to the
continual action of the sun's direct rays during several months.
