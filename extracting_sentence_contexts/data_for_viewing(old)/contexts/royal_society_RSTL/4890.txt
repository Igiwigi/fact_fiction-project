On the, first point, I maintain that a rugged channel, like that of a glacier, with a
moderate slope, being packed with angular solid fragments, would speedily be choked,
and that farther pressure from behind (for such a mass can only convey thrusts, not
strains) would tend to wedge the fragments more tightly. Some grains of dry sand
will slide easily down a plate of glass; but try to thrust it forcibly through a narrow-
ing tube, or even a uniform one, the lower end of which rests on a surface over which
the sand has poured, and your effort is vain, the tube will sooner burst; and even
rocks may be blasted rather than the power of the wedge yield*. If the figure of the
bed or channel be in any degree irregular, that is, have expansions and contractions,
however smooth its surface, however small the sliding angle of ice upon that surface,
the choking of a strait or contraction by the piling of the fragments will be as com- |
plete and effectual as if the lateral friction were excessive. Now in point of fact we
have such cases as this ;—a glacier 2000 yards wide (the Mer de Glace at the Tacul) |
issues by an orifice or strait 900 yards wide ;—the glacier of Talefre, a nearly oval |
basin, pours out its annual overcharge by an orifice the breadth of which is but one- |
third of its lesser, one-sixth of its greater diameter. On the supposition of jostling
fragments, the facility of motion is increased, as the comminntion is greater. 'The
impossibility of the discharge of a fragmentary solid through a gorge by long stripes
fractured parallel to its length, and constituting parallelopipedons of a certain
breadth, is evident.

Crevasses.—In the second place, I maintain that actual inspection shows that a glacier
is not the mass of fragments nor of parallelopipedons which some persons have, naturally
enough at first, sight, 8upposed it to be. In truth there is not an approach to such a
