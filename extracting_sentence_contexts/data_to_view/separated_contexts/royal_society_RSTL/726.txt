Bi66in,* and much has been contributed in every
respect by Mr. ProvsT,F but the subject has received the
greatest extension and some of the most valuable additions
from the ingenious labours of Mr. Davy, particularly the
discovery of the important fact, that catechu or terra japonica
consists principally of tannin. #

The united results of the experiments made by these and
other eminent chemists, appear therefore to have fully esta-
blished, that tannin is a peculiar substance or principle which
is naturally formed, and exists in a great number of vegetable
bodies, such as oak-bark, galls, sumach, catechu, &c. &c.
commonly accompanied by extract, gallic acid, and mucilage. But no one has hitherto supposed that it could be produced
by art, unless a fact noticed by Mr. Cyexevix may be consi-
dered as some indication of it.
