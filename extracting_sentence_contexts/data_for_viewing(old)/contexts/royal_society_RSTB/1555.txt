make it, exactly similar to the actual specimen, the nuclei are very small and the
scanty protoplasmic matrix is entirely devoid of cell outlines. The group of nuclei

marked b, ¢, in which three nuclei are seen closely allied to one another, seem very
probably derived from fragmented nuclei, although it is impossible to be quite
certain of the fact owing to the nature of the protoplasm, the crowding together
of the nuclei and the absence of cell walls.

The growth of stroma tissue described above, causes a swelling into the lumen of
the uterus and the thickness of the mucosa is in this way increased.

When the nuclei, which I believe to be formed by fragmentation (fig. 2), are
compared with those which are formed by division (fig. 1), the size of the former will
be seen to favour the view expressed. Both these figures are drawn on the same
scale, and it is clear that the group of nuclei in fig. 2, marked a, are certainly not
larger than a single nucleus of the dividing cells show in fig. 1.
