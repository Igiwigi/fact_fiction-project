In the black races, the reflexes or glistening sheen of the retina in the neighbour-
hood of the vessels and macula, observable to some extent in every hypermetropic
dark eye, are very striking in youth; and the minute fibres of the optic nerve, which
radiate in every direction from the disc, although quite invisible in Europeans,
form in them innumerable semi-transparent stri.

2. Troglodytes and 3. Simia.—The Chimpanzee (Troglodytes niger), the Gorilla
(Z. gorilla), and the Ourang (Simia satyrus), have a fundus which closely resembles
that of the Negro in almost every detail. We find the same chocolate-coloured field
with a darker coloured macula area bounded by a bright circular reflex ring ; the
same distribution of vessels; the round or vertically oval pink disc, and the same
semi-transparent nerve striz. In fact, with the exception of the colour of the fundus,
the general characteristics found in Man are common to all the Catarhine (Old
World Monkeys), and all the Platyrhinze (New World Monkeys).

4, Hylobates.—The Gibbons have a fundus which departs somewhat from that of
the other Anthropoidee, inasmuch as the choroidal vessels are very marked, and
appear as orange-red stripes radiating from the disc as a common centre.

1. Macacus.—M. inwus (Pig-tailed Macaque), M. rhesus, M. cynomolgus, M. spe-
ciosus (Japanese Ape), M. sinicus (Bonnet Monkey), are all very similar, the appearance
and distribution of the choroidal vessels resembling that of the Gibbon. The dise, the
