W. M. HICKS: A CRITICAL STUDY OF SPECTRAL SERIES. $7

in fact, they only observed the triplet S(2), 8, (3), S.(8) of the next and 8, (4)—too
few to give the series. The triplet $(1) was observed first by Lenmann* (more
accurately later by Hermann‘) and the series completed and arranged by SaunvErs.}
The first three are only sufficient to determine the constants with « only; in the
analogous cases of Mg, Ca, and Sr the limits so determined have all come out too
large. Here it makes the calculated values of wave numbers for 8, (4) and §, (5)
differ from those assigned by SauNDERS by amounts too large respectively by 71 and
159—in other words, the limits here, also, are much too large if his allocations are
correct.
