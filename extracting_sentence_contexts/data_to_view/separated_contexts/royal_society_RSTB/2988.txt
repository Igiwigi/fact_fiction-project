The distinguishing characters are such that
only adults can be satisfactorily determined. V/. neglecta, however, has on the
average a smaller number of tarsal joints and a shorter antennulary peduncle, as
compared with its antennary scale. In fact, it is altogether a smaller animal than
M. flexuosa, Th√© differences appeared to be largely explicable as stages of growth
of one form. Most systematists have, however, found it impossible to identify
specimens of Mysis with M. neglectu. We have examined the chromatophore-system and find that in specimens referable
to M. flexuosa two clearly distinct types of centre- and branch-systems occur.
