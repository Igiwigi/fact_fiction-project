As will be seen immediately, this gave satisfactory agreement with
sounded observed lines up to m= 15; and as a matter of fact this series was used ‘to
test for the parallel sets displaced (+2d,)S() on either side of it. Now the formula
constants for a set only vary slightly if the wave-number of the line chosen for m = 1
is changed considerably. This therefore did not prove definitely that 20559 is the
correct Dj, (1), and as a fact it does not satisfy the multiple test. Its mantissa is
897337—3114¢ That of the line 19989, which is shown above to be the origin of the
normal D set is 879853—30°29¢ The difference is 17484 = 2843+71.
