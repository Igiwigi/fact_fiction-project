In this case
the formate is. the most transparent of salts, and it may be seen that the acetate bears
the same relation to it in transparency that in the case of the sodium alt the
propionate bore to the acetate. A glance at Diagram No. 3 will show that a cell-full of the acids corresponding to
the ethylic and propylic alcobols, which we have every reason to believe are perfectly
pure substances, are less diactinic than the alcohols as shown in Diagram No. 1, which
fact points to the carboxyl group in the molecule possessing a special absorptive power
greater than that of hydroxyl. We have further evidence of this in the shorb
spectrum of oxalic as compared with acetic acid. The specimen examined was pre-
pared with great care and repeatedly recrystallised.
