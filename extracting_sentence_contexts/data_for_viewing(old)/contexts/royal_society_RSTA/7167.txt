The real drawback to Aitken’s process is, however, the severe cancellation that occurs in
the numerical calculation of the sequences { f,(t)}. Suppose |x, |>|x,,, |, then from (1-6)

demonstrating the cancellation that takes place on forming /,,,(¢). In fact, if R leading
figures of Z,(t) and Z,(t—1) are identical, then R figures are lost ‘off the front’ in
forming f,,,(¢). Since R increases with ¢, this cancellation becomes increasingly severe as
the work progresses, and a large number of significant figures must be retained in the early
sequences of the process.

Aitken himself is aware of this difficulty and remarks (1926, p. 294): ‘If it were really
necessary to carry the columns to any great length this [cancellation] would constitute a
defect, but we shall show in a later section how, given a few consecutive terms of a slowly
approximating sequence Z,,, it is in general possible to derive successively other sequences
which give enormously improved results. Again, to find the smallest roots, we can make use
of the reciprocal equation.’ Unfortunately, the former of these devices fails to remove the
difficulty. The derived sequences to which he refers are denoted by Z(t), and if x,, x,
