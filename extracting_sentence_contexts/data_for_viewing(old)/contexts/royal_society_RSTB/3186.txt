earlier stages, a fact which tends to confirm my suggestion, that “yolk formation”
is only the final stage of a long period of metabolic activity.

There is yet another feature in the behaviour of the Limulus egg, as described by
Monson, which tends to throw light on the question of the relation of yolk formation
to the general cell-metabolism.. It concerns the behaviour of the nucleolus. The
separation of the egg from its follicle cells in Limulus is not the only event which
synchronises with the commencement of yolk formation, for this moment is also marked
by the total disappearance of the nucleolus. In considering the behaviour of the

_latter structure in Antedon, and in attempting to harmonise the absence of any trace
of correlation between its activity and the commencement of yolk formation with the
fact that this activity ceased entirely with the completion of the latter process,
T suggested that the activity of the nucleolus might be concerned with a much more
fundamental and wide-spread metabolic process of the cytoplasm than that which is
represented by yolk formation, and that it is the cessation of this more fundamental
process, at the completion of yolk formation, which -brings about the cessation of
nucleolar activity. I also pointed out that not only did such a suggestion remove
the difficulty that the nucleolar activity was characteristic of the whole of the growth
period of the egg preceding yolk formation, but that a large nucleolus is characteristic
of many cells which differ widely in the result of their metabolic activity (e.g., gland
cells and ganglion cells), A comparison between the behaviour of the nucleolus in
Antedon with that described for Limulus by Munson offers most striking confirmation
of this suggestion that the nucleolar activity is related to the metabolism of the
cytoplasm as a whole, rather than to the very small part of its activity which is
