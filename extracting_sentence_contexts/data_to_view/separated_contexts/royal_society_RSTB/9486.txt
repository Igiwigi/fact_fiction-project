In a to either maximize the likelihood or combine it with a prior
context where genetic sequences are mutationally saturated, and sample from the posterior distribution. Parametric

systematic errors (i.e. wrong trees with high statistical models have represented the most common type of model


classically considered in many domains of phylogenetics and
statistical evolutionary genetics. The fact that they are easily
implemented both in a maximum likelihood and in a Bayesian
context may have given the impression that the choice between
these two paradigms is merely a philosophical one, mostly
depending on oneâ€™s personal stance with respect to the status
of priors and the interpretation of probabilities. On the other side, more sophisticated models, involving
several levels of distributions, non-parametric priors, con-
tinuous-time processes, among other features, have been
progressively introduced and explored in phylogenetics. Such models do not always have a clearly defined number
of parameters.
