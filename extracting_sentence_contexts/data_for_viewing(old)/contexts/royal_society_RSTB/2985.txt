is always bad, even in the youngest specimens (see fig. 34, U. C. L., R. 13); the
tissue between the bundles is reduced to a brown disorganised mass, in which mere
traces of the cellular structure are recognisable. The peripheral zone is somewhat
better preserved, and appears to consist of two or three layers of elongated elements,
with walls rather thicker than those of the subjacent tissue. This darker zone
sometimes contrasts rather sharply with the light brown of the disorganised
parenchyma within (see figs. 1, 2 and 9). Elements with black contents,
recalling the “secretory sacs” of Lyyinodendron, can sometimes be detected in the
cupular tissue, but their characters are not definite enough to help materially in
identification. The most interesting point about the ground-tissue of the cupule is
the fact that it was infested with fungi. Fungus-spores are almost always to be
detected ; in some specimens (e.g., U. C. L., R. 15) the tissues are completely filled
with them, and they occur in such masses that they might be taken for a part of the
normal structure, if it were not for comparison with other specimens in which the
sume bodies occur isolated. Fungal hyphe are also found, sometimes forming dense
strands following the course of the vascular bundles. All indications point to the
cupule having already been an effete organ at the stage when its preservation took
place, its condition contrasts markedly with that of the well-preserved adjacent
fragments of the vegetative organs of Lyginodendron and other plants. This fact has
an important bearing on the condition of the cupular glands, now to be described.

The glands form the most conspicuous feature of the cupule, by means of which
even small fragments can usually be recognised at once ; they occur on all parts of
