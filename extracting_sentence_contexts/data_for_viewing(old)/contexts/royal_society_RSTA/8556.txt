As by hypothesis the naturalized thickness of the calm is to be Z = 0-2 it is found,
by interpolation in the preceding table, that the sphere must have entered the wind at

rT.
T, = —0°588; Rx = 0-758; Ru = 0-749; | RxdT = —0-355,
“0
and have left the wind again with

T, = +0:670; Rx = 0°348; Ras = —0°556; [Rxat = 0-284,
0

These numbers are confirmed by the fact that they satisfy the relations (2), (3) above.

The Motion in the Calm.—May we apply to this region the simple theory in which unity
is put in place of ,/{1-+ (Rx/Ru)*} ?

The largest values of Rx/Ry occur either (i) just under the interface where R, is
smallest, or (ii) at the muzzle. Consider the former. There, Rx can be found from the
preceding table (IX) as soon as we know the jump in Rx at the interface, namely, + Vx.
We already know that Vx = —R, roughly. If so, the sphere just before entering the
wind has Rx = 0:758—0-500 = 0-258, Ry = 0-749, while just after leaving the wind it
has Ry = 0°348—0-500 = —0-152, while Ry = —0-556.

In these two cases ,/{1+ (Rx/Ru)*} = 1-06 and 1-04 severally.
