of the phrenies still causes movement of the diaphragm, and the conclusion is drawn
that the action is not peripheral. More careful observation shows, however, that the
movement is insufficient to inflate the lungs, and that the impulses can no longer
reach the diaphragm in sufficient strength. Under larger doses than suffice to cause
asphyxia the paralysis of the phrenic terminations becomes complete, while the
muscle continues to respond to direct stimulation as before (Experiment 6).

These experiments show that when asphyxia occurs under cobra poison the

terminations of the phrenic nerves are unable to transmit efficient impulses to the
diaphragm. The other respiratory nerves are equally disabled. This does not
negative the view that the centre is also emitting impulses which are also insufficient,
but in view of the fact that the rhythm of the centre is unimpaired, and that the
peripheral action affords a sufficient explanation of the weakness of the respiration, it is
unnecessary to make such a hypothesis, for which there is no foundation whatever.*
_ It is difficult to obtain direct graphic records of the movements of the diaphragm
during experiments of long duration, and, on the other hand, in more acute
experiments the changes progress rapidly to complete paralysis of the phrenics.
I have, however, followed the changes in another, more accessible muscle—the
gastrocnemius of the cat and rabbit—in several experiments, of which I give an
example in Experiment 8.

Experiment 8.—A rabbit of 1050 grm, anesthetised with urethane. Cannul inserted into the trachea
and jugular vein, - The right sciatic nerve was isolated and divided above. The femur was clamped to a
standard, and the lower part of the gastrocnemius muscle was exposed and attached to a lever writing on
