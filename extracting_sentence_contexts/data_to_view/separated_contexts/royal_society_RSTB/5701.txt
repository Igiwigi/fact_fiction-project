In the remaining one (No. 350) the plane of the cut could not be determined with
certainty, as the older leaves had been displaced, probably through unsatisfactory
embedding. It may be noted that I,/ never occupied the gap between I, and the
wound. This may be explained by the fact that I, is situated at a higher level than P,,
being younger, so that the gap between P, and the wound became available the
sooner. There remain four experiments, forming a third group, in which I,/ occupied a rather
different position, its centre lying directly above the wound. Three examples, Nos.
210, 367 and 379, are shown in figs 14-16.
