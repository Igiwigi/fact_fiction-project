bable that in many states of combination these metals may take up the mere con-
ducting state ; for instance, that whilst in the protoxide, iron may constitute a mag-
net, in the peroxide it is only a conductor ; and in this respect it is not a little
curious to find oxygen, which as a gas is a paramagnetic body (2782.), reducing iron
down to, and indeed far below its own condition, weight for weight. In their
various salts also and solutions, these metals may, in conjunction with the combined
matter, be acting only as conductors.

2835. Perhaps I ought not to have called the condition of concentration or expan-
sion of the lines of magnetic force in the bodies acting as conductors, a polarity ;
inasmuch as true magnetic polarity depends essentially and entirely on the direction
of the line of force, and not on any mere compression or divergence of these lines.
I have done s0 only that I might point with the more facility to facts and views that
have heretofore been associated with some supposed polarity in the bodies which,
whether paramagnetic or diamagnetic, I have been considering as mere conductors,
and I hope that no mistake of my meaning will arise in consequence. I have already
asked for such liberty in the use of phrases (lines of force, conducting power, &C.)
(2149. 2797.) as may, for the time, set me free from the bondage of preconceived
notions; these are, for that very reason, exceedingly useful, provided they are for the
time sufficiently restricted in their meaning, and do not admit of any hurtful Joose-
ness or inaccuracy in the representation of facts.
