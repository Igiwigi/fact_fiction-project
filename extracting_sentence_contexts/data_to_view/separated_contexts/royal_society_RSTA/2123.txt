The threshold margin is required to ensure that the
portions of the Vy_e waveform shown in figure 3 not contributing to the STDP behaviour, remain below the switching threshold
even for longer pulsewidths.

deterministic as opposed to stochastic. We also note that pulses with amplitude below 0.45 V have
almost no chance to switch the MT] (at least up to 10 ns pulse widths). We use these facts to design
the input and output neuron spikes. This is explained in detail in the next section.

(b) Stochastic spike timing-dependent plasticity learning in magnetoelectric-magnetic
tunnel junction synapses

We have described how shaping the pulses appropriately and mapping it to switching probability
characteristics of ME-MTJ synapses can lead to probabilistic potentiation and depression in
figure 3. We present the results and parameters of pulse shapes that result in stochastic STDP
learning in ME-MT]J synapses.
