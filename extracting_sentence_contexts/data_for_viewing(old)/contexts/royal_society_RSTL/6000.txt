wed that there are alternate elevations and depressions of all the respiratory pheno-
| during the day, due to the temporary influence of food, and that the maximum
fluence of food always occurs in from 13 to 24 hours after the meal. I also proved,
Zom the state of the system in a prolonged fast, as well as from the tolerably uniform
Zate at the end of the interyal between the meals, that there is on each day a basal or
rmal line below which the amount of respiratory action does not ordinarily fall ; and
-Zalso showed that there is a maximum elevation from food which is tolerably uniform,
d which is the most pronounced after the breakfast and tea meals. Hence it appeared
t the influence of food is in two degrees: â€”lst, that which lies between those two lines
End exceeds the normal or basal line; and 2nd, that which sustains the system up to
e minimum or basal line. The former action is temporary and of short duration,
Fhilst the latter is permanent.
S Proceeding from these facts, T have prosecuted a lengthened inquiry into the influence
F mamorow articles of food over the respiration, when taken separately and not in the
mbined form in which we take them at meals, and have endeavoured to ascertain
hat is their maximum effect. As nearly all food tends to sustain and increase the
tal actions, and as in the total absence of food for a lengthened period the respiratory
anges are sustained to the extent of 75 per cent. of that with food, my inquiries
have been almost entirely directed to determine that influence, which acts 80 as to
_ Ui between the maximum and minimum lines just mentioned. Except within very
row limits, T have not found any substance taken as food or with food which mate-
y lowers that minimum line; and, moreover, T do not know any method whereby
it would be possible, in a state of health, to show the action of any substance which
acts much below it. Hence my aim has been to show to what extent yarious substances
Taise the respiratory changes above or depress them below a basal line, and not merely
