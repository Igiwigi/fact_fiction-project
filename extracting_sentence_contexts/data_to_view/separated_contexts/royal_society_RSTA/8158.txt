Again
adopting the nomenclature of the steel industry, the specimens in group C.1 are
conveniently described as “ billets,” and those in groups C.2, 3 and 4 as “ forgings.”
A few of the specimens, such as Nos. 12/C.1-1, 13/C. 1-2, 14/C.1-3 and 15/C.1-4,
are thinned out at one end, indicating that a portion of these specimens has been
forged down to some smaller section, and cut off. Specimen No. 20/C.1-9 is exceptional. It has a truly square section and is fractured
at each end; in fact, on seeing it one cannot escape the idea that it may have been
broken from a manufactured steel or iron bar. Clearly this does not fit in with
Farapay’s regular plan of dealing with the material he melted. On the other hand,
he must certainly have had plain or ordinary carbon steel or iron for use as the raw
material in the making of his alloys.
