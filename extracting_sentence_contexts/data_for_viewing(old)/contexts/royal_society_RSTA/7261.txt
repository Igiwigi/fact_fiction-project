calculated from the least squares reductions. If the layer gives no wave (as when it has
a lower velocity than the one above it), or if the wave is masked by the previous arrival of
other waves, the velocity must be obtained from measurements at other stations or at
outcrops. A standard error must then be assigned to it from a consideration of the
particular circumstances of each case. If the depth of the interface between layers of
velocity v and v’ has an error dH, the resulting error in a deeper interface is : =a ” SH.
These errors were computed for each station and combined as if they were independent
(which, strictly, they are not).

The Palaeozoic is distinguished from the Mesozoic by the difference between their
fossil contents, and since seismographs can only find lithological discontinuities, the
interpretation of the data in terms of the geological column must involve considerations
outside seismology. It involves in fact the following of a lithological feature identified in
a bore-hole or at an outcrop into a region in which its depth is not known. This following
of a known feature is the crucial point in all applied seismology; the lay-out of the
stations and the length of the lines must be chosen so as to reduce the chances of losing
the selected horizon and of mistaking another for it. This possibility may be much re-
duced by arranging the stations in lines, the ends of the lines being at bore-holes. For if
an attempt is made to trace the Palaeozoic floor from one bore-hole to another and it is
found that a Jurassic limestone is being mapped on arrival at the bore-hole at the other
end of the line, a mistake in identification has been made at some point. Ifsuch consider-
ations are neglected very serious mistakes may be made, and the structure deduced may
bear no relation whatever to nature.
