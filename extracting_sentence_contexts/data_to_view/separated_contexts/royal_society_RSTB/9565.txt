Danoff & Fleming conducted
folding of OmpAj7; in DMPC LUVs from just below (20°C)
to just above (26°C) the phase transition temperature. Over
this minute temperature range, folding was dramatically accel-
erated at the lipid T,, while extremely slow both below and
above this temperature [35]. The significance of this result lies
in the fact that gel and fluid phases of a lipid bilayer coexist
at the T,, with a heterogeneous boundary where they meet. Membranes are well known to be more permeable to solutes
and to contain defects at the T,, [36-39]. Notably, the accelera-
tion of uOMP folding in vivo may represent a previously
unrecognized role for this membrane conformation.
