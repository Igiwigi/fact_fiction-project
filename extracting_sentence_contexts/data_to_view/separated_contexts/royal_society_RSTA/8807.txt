The hope might even be entertained of obtaining by this method some knowledge of
the number of electrons partaking in the emission of a line if slight changes in the
oun could be found. For instance, we shall find in these spectra not a single group
of 8, D, or F series as in are spectra, but several independent groups, viz., d and f
sequents, depending on different multiples of A, If these gave slightly different
values of the oun it could be explained by a transference of electrons. There is little
evidence of such variation, but it might occur, for instance, in the oun as deduced
respectively from A, and A, As A, depends alone on the measurement of the »
separation of a triplet it is not susceptible of such exact determination as A,, and, as
a fact, a suspicion sometimes arises that such a slight difference may exist, and that
8 from », is somewhat less than from », [III., p. 333] as also here.
