experiments were then performed under two different sets
of conditions: first, the unimolecular reaction from the mono-
mer to the assembly-competent protomer was studied at very
low ClyA concentrations (about 100 pM) that guaranteed that
protomer assembly did not take place. In the second set of
experiments, protomer oligomerization and formation of
pore complexes was studied at ClyA concentrations above
5nM over a wide range of concentrations (5 nM-5 uM).
For this purpose, FRET donor/acceptor—labelled ClyA was
mixed with a high excess of unlabelled wild-type ClyA, so
that ClyA oligomers and pore complexes only contained a
single copy of donor/acceptor—labelled ClyA. The complete
assembly mechanism could then be clarified based on the fact
that the ClyA monomer (M), the monomeric, kinetic inter-
mediate (I), the protomer (P) and the protomer in the
context of oligomers or pores (P,) showed distinct and
characteristic FRET efficiencies that allowed the quantitative,
time-resolved analysis of their population during protomer
formation or pore assembly [20].
