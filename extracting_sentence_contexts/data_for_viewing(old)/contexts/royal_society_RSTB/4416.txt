i} produced, by flaking; an implement of river-drift type by first of all fashioning the
g flint into a rostro-carinate, and then proceeding to transform the flat ventral plane
E into a cutting edge. But he does not wish to claim that the ancient flint workers
A in making a pointed “ palolithic” implement always began by flaking the flint into
a rostro-carinate form. He wishes only to suggest that the knowledge of the
necessity for the provision of two flat striking-platforms in the making of a pointed
paleolithic implement was acquired by the makers of the rostro-carinate specimens,
and that this knowledge was handed on and preserved by the peoples who lived
after them. But it is necessary to emphasise the fact that the method of preparing
a nodule of flint for the production of a rostro-carinate is precisely the same as that
needed for the production of a pointed paleolithic, river-drift implement. The flint
is first of all shaped to a tabular form as in the case of the rostro-carinate (figs. 34
and 3p), and in fig. 8A the tabular piece of flint and the palmolithic implement are
