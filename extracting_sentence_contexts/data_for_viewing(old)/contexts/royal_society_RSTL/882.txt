which is alloyed with silver; but, in some cases, it seems to
wear rather more than gold alloyed with silver and copper; the
difference is not however very considerable,

This $ort of standard gold, as well as that which is alloyed
with silver and copper, appears commonly, after a certain degree
of wear, of a coppery colour, more or less deep, in those parts
which are the most prominent; and, when coin thus alloyed
exhibits such an appearance, it is frequently and vulgarly said

to have been in contact with copper money ; and sometimes
guineas having this appearance have been refused, upon the
supposition that they were debased, But the real fact is, that
when copper constitutes part or the whole of the alloy, it be-

the process of annealing ; and the blackish crust of copper, in

this state, must then be removed by the. solution of alum,
called the blanching liquor. Now it is evident, that after this
operation, the surfaces of the blanks or unstamped pieces, can
no longer be regarded as standard gold. For, if copper alone
forms the alloy, it must be dissolved and separated from the
