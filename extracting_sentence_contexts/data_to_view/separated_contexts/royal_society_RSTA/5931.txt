The computational results reveal that the
improvement (i.e. the reduction in the bound) provided by the upper estimate is negligible, i.e. Nucant & Nucan ~0.106Ra°/12. This reflects the fact that the linear-stability constraint is almost
entirely accommodated by an adjustment of the interior gradient of Tg, rendering it slightly
unstable, rather than via the anticipated thickening of the thermal boundary layer. The lower
estimate, however, does successfully capture the classical 1/3 scaling for both stress-free (Nu) ~
