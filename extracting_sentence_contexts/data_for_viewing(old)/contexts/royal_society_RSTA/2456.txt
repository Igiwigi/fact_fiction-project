the site storage limit will also need to be two orders of magnitude larger than in ITER. This can be
done safely from the purely technical standpoint, but will certainly be a difficult discussion point
with any licensing authority.

In the following, there will be a short description of what has to change in comparison with
ITER for the inner fuel cycle of a reactor. It is clear from the above discussion that we need to
directly recycle the majority of the DT gas (figure 8) and not have all the exhaust going through
the T-plant [14]. A method developed at KIT is to use super permeation foils which allow only
atomic hydrogen isotopes to path through [15]. This requires large surfaces near the divertor and
an atomizer. A small test stand with such a set-up is installed at KIT. The foils can also build


pressure on the other side and thus contribute to pumping due to the fact that the recombined
molecules of hydrogen cannot penetrate them. The downside of this method is that hydrogen
which is outgassing from metals will contaminate the DT fuel and thus this has to be controlled.
Also, the D and T isotopes have to be rebalanced and therefore a small part of the exhaust
stream has to go through isotope separation. Another unknown is how impurities which may
be deposited on the foils will impact the permeation capabilities; first results suggest that it may
not be a large problem but further research is needed.

Instead of the ITER cryo pumps (high vacuum pumps raising the pressure to roughing pump
pressures) and roughing pumps (pumps which can pump roughing pressure and elevate it to
atmospheric pressure), a new type of Mercury diffusion and Mercury ring pump will replace the
two types of pumps described above and be used for continuous pumping [16]. This avoids the
difficulties with the cryo pumps regarding inventory and regeneration, in particular regeneration
