E 800n extends towards the centre in a horizontal direction, so that the formation of the
Â£ vesicles in the centre of the pock takes place later than that in the periphery.
6 Notwithstanding this, however, numerous vesicles are seen to make their appearance
5 in the centre, which stand in no direct connexion with those of the periphery. But,
E in pocks of which the central portion, instead of being depressed, is elevated (as in
{5 many pocks on the mammary glands), the formation of the vesicles commences centrally

and gradually spreads towards the periphery. Now the question arises, In what way
do the yesicles form? That the yesicles in their first stage are filled with a trans-
parent fluid lymph and that they afterwards gradually become filled with lymph or
pus-corpuseles are well-known facts; but the question of their mode of origin has, I
think, not been investigated with sufficient detail. The assertion of LuGixBtnL that
the formation of the pustule is to a great extent due to the appearance of giant cells,
must be.at once abandoned 8 far as relates to yariola of sheep, for in no instance have
T been able to ee any indication of such giant cells in the rete Malpighii.
