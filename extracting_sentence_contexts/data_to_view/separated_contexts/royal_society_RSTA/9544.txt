It may, however, be
noted that the general agreement between the two arrangements A and A, is due to
the fact that except for Ba A is roughly 3A, Also as affecting the argument in
favour of the arrangement, it may be mentioned that a change of unity in the
multiples of A or A, in the most favourable direction towards the value °21520 affects
that ratio in the two cases as follows, viz. :—

For Mg . . ‘21380, ‘21626; Ca. . ‘21054, 21697; Sr. . 19588, ‘21960;

and, of course, very much larger deviations for Ba. A glance at Table T. shows that in Al and the Ga sub-group the « is always larger
than ‘2154. In fact, the actual ratios of a/u are

These cannot be the same within observation limits, and even in the Ga sub-group
Tn is too far out to be due to mere errors of observation. It is clear, therefore, that
no terms in 1—m*' can occur in the same way as in the other cases. In the discussion of the alkalies the term W (1—m-~') was supposed to be based on
the F-sequence, which was taken to be m+1—2W (1—m-7').
