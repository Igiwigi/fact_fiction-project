If we reject the two results from the cylinder, (which I shall show, in the
sequel, cannot be depended upon,) we shall haye the mean of the rest equal to
1-748: thus confirming the remark just made, that the factor for this addi-
tional correction, in pendulums of equal length and of similar construction,
seems to depend on the form and magnitude of the moving body, and is not
affected by its weight or density. This result certainly does not accord with
that deduced by M. Besszr, from his experiments with brass and ivory balls
of nearly the same size as the present ones ; which result I have already stated
to be 1:946*., M. BessxrL's experiments appear to have been conducted with
very great care, and with all that accuracy and all those powerful talents for
which he is 80 highly distinguished. At the same time however I would
remark that I have carefully revised all my own experiments, and have not
been able to discover any source of error: in fact, the general result is corro-
borated by the uniformity in the results of the experiments with the other pen-
dulums. The subject therefore is still open for further elucidation. In all
M. Bxssx1's experiments, he used wires of two different lengths ; one being
about the length of the seconds pendulum, and the other differing from it the
exact length of the French toise : or, in round numbers, about 39 inches and
116 inches. 'The value of the factor which he has deduced, appears to be that
which he considers common to both : but it perhaps may be a question whe-
ther pendulums, differing 80 much in their lengths, give precisely the same
value for the factor.
