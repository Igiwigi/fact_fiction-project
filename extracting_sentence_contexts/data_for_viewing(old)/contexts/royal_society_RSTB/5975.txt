not simple structures. The early pteridospermous seeds certainly terminated branches,

but Tanstey produced good anatomical evidence to substantiate it.

256 H. HAMSHAW THOMAS ON SOME PTERIDOSPERMOUS PLANTS

even though these may be regarded as segments of large foliar structures, but when we
come to consider the morphology of the inflorescence of the Corystospermacez we find
facts of considerable interest. The seed-bearing structures of this group have been
described above as inflorescences instead of as sporophylls, though they were mainly
branched in one plane and often show a slight difference between the cuticles on the
upper and lower sides. But in the Angiosperms and other seed plants, structures
which are subtended by leaves or bracts are always regarded as branches rather than
leaves, and in the Corystospermacee the seed-bearing structures are constantly subtended
by bracts. Thus the only parts which might be described as sporophylls are the lateral
pedicels bearing the cupules, and the plane of branching and cuticle structure of the
main part of the inflorescence have no morphological significance. But there is no
reason why these pedicels should be regarded as foliar structures, especially since the
apex of each lateral branch subtended by a bract is, in several species, terminated by
accupule. So the obvious and simplest interpretation is to regard the whole structure
as a branch system. The evidence of the Corystospermacee suggests that the concept
