Combining equations (2-1) and (I, 3-5), we have
Afi VER+P, Aofy= YER +p and Af, = YER +P. (2-2) In principle, p could be determined by using the incompressibility condition A,A,A; = 1
to eliminate A,, A, and A, in these equations. However, this would be extremely cumbersome
to carry out and, in fact, the uniqueness of the physically possible values of A,, A, and As,
for given values of /,, /, and /;, can be proved without resorting to this analysis. Suppose that there are two possible sets of values of A,, A,and A,. Let us denote these Aj, A3, 44
and Aâ€˜, AS, AZ.
