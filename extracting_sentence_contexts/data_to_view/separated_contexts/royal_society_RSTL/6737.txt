The experiments are all perfectly concurrent as regards the action of the
'aqueous vapour upon radiant heat.


8 PROFESSOR TYNDALL ON THE RELATION

The power of aqueous vapour being thus established, meteorologists may, T think,
apply the result without fear. That 10 per cent. of the entire terrestrial radiation is
absorbed by the aqueous yapour which exists within ten feet of the earth's surface on
a day of average humidity, is a moderate estimate. In warm weather and air approach-
ing to saturation, the absorption would probably be considerably greater. 'This single
fact at once suggests the importance of the established action as regards meteorology. I am persuaded that by means of it many difficulties will be solved, and many familiar
effects, which we pass over without sufficient scrutiny because they are familiar, will
have a novel interest, attached to them by their connexion with the action of aqueous
vapour on radiant heat. While leaving these applications to be made in all their
fullness by meteorologists, I would refer, by way of illustration, to one or two points
on which I think the experiments bear.
