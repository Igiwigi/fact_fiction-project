M. H. Lenocgf has met with a similar instance in Arctia caja; Dr. Kiee in Sphinz
populif, quoted by StezBoLD; Mr. Jounsrox in Smerinthus ocellatush ; Mr. Curmis in
Bombyz polyphemus ||; and in Bombys mori various naturalists have convinced themselves
of the same facts. Mr. WesrwooD has favoured me with the following extract from his unpublished
notes:—* Mr. Davis (the publisher of the Entomological Magazine, and himself a good
entomologist) informs me of a singular circumstance connected with the Egger moth,
which has been observed by Mr. Tay, the Irish entomologist, after whom MWesites Tardis
has been named, this gentleman having reared three generations of this moth from a
single impregnation.” The Rev. P. H. NeEwNnax of Guildford, the Rev. HuGn A. STowELL and Mr. E. W.
Ropix80Nn have kindly informed me by letter that they have observed the same fact
respectively in Smerinthus populi, Arctia villica, and Arctia caja. In Psyche helix and Solenobia parthenogenesis appears to be the rule, while in the other
Lepidoptera it occurs as an exception ; taking then these nineteen exceptional cases, it
will be observed that they have all occurred in the hawkmoths or moths, and not one in
the butterflies; four in Smerinthus populi and two in S. ocellatus, and three in Arctic
caja; that, taking the genera, five are in Smerinthus, four in Arctia and Gastrophaga,
and two in Bombyz. No doubt the Silkworm moth (Þ. mori) has been 80 much and 80
carefully observed, that if parthenogenesis did occur even rarely in that species, it would
certainly have been noticed by many observers ; but I can suggest no explanation of the
very unequal distribution of the other cases, except that agamogenesis does occur More
frequently in some genera and species than in others, and & fortiori, that it takes place in
80me.
