SUBSTITUTIONAL ANALYSIS TO INVARIANTS 103

V1I—Tue Function f; (x,_”)
$27. We define this function in terms of the functions of Section I, thus :
Ta) ee ea omg CO ois aay aa (I) >

the summation extends to all the representations of the symmetric group of 3 letters. The importance here of this function lies in the fact that the generating function
for ternary perpetuants of degree 3 for a single form may be written

x {3] 3. DT 3, ,
where the suffix after the bracket indicates the particular variable in the function. The attempt is made to express this in the form

b (x, xy) vb (9, 2)

b (x, xy) = xb (9, 29)’

where ¢, 4 are rational integral functions ; thus the function would be separated
into two parts of which obviously the first only concerns the perpetuant problem
in hand.
