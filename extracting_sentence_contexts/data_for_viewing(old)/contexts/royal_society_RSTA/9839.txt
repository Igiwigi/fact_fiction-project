not unknown in other groups of alloys, but they do not exhibit a well-balanced
laminated structure unless a compound comes into play.

The micro-structures found in alloys containing less than 95 per cent. of zine, that
is to say, lying just to the right of the eutectic concentration, further support the
view that the 8 meteral, which forms the dark-etching constituent of these alloys, is
a definite compound. These micro-structures are illustrated under a magnification of
200 diameters in figs. 13 and 14. These two figures show the presence of strikingly
characteristic dendritic crystals, which possess a strong tendency to assume six-rayed
forms in which angles closely approximating to 60 degrees are of frequent and typical
appearance,

This is a striking characteristic, particularly in view of the fact that in the great
majority of metals the dendritic branches tend to form rectangular systems. The
microscopic evidence thus strongly supports the pyrometric evidence for the existence
of a definite compound, and grounds have been given above for the view that this
compound is represented by the formula Al,Zns.

The close relationship between the six-rayed crystals just described and the eutectic
surrounding them is also illustrated in an interesting manner by fig. 14. It is there
clearly evident how the crystallization of the eutectic has radiated from the various
branches of the dendrite, resulting in the formation of an interesting pattern.

The photomicrographs, figs. 13 and 14, having been taken from slowly cooled
specimens of the alloys, are not free from signs of the reaction represented in the
