of the amyloid precursor protein of both transthyretin-
and insulin-associated amyloid. They serve to nucleate
the fibrillization of AA amyloid precursor protein when
polymerized into small fibrils, but not as unpolymer-
ized peptides. Labelling with I’*! has served to locate
AA amyloid fibrils that have been nucleated by these
heterologous amyloid-enhancing factors. Thus, if these
replicating systems are thought to be alive, they have
already synthesized ‘life’ and published it.

10. INDUSTRIAL VIRUSES AND ICE NINE Per Westermark and his colleagues have demon-
‘Ice Nine’ of Kurt Vonnegut Jr in his Cat’s cradle is a strated the induction of AA amyloidogenesis by nucle-
fictional approach to the problem of nucleation ation with heteronucleants such as silk (Lundmark
(Vonnegut 1963) based on a sound understanding of — etal. 2005) and spider webs and oral paté de foie gras in
the phenomenon. His brother, William, was a major transgenic mice (Solomon et al. 2007).

There are over at least 200 twinning possibilities for
quartz (SiOz). Most possible forms have been found in
the over 30 000 years of search for them. Rare forms
are named after the locality where they are first found.
When one new twin ‘form’, ‘strain’ or ‘species’ is
found, it is usually named after the region where it has
been found. Then, it is common to find other examples
of this particular strain of twinned quartz in shafts for
many hundreds of kilometres around the first finding,
