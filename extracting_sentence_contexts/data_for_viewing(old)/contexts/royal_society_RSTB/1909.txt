nucleolus surrounded by a number of deeply staining rod-shaped chromatin bodies,
A collection of similar chromatin masses is to be seen in the middle of the female
nucleus. These bodies are clearly the same as those represented in a similar position
in fig, 20, There can be little doubt that these bodies are really the chromosomes of
the two nuclei. The stage represented in fig. 22, in which a longitudinally split
chromosome is clearly visible, appears to follow closely upon that of fig. 21.

In fig. 21 a number of deeply staining straight (kinoplasmic) fibres are to be seen
scattered about in the substance of both the male and female nuclei; these threads
resemble in their staining reaction those of the earlier stage (fig. 20), and areâ€”
evidently of the sume nature. In this latter stage, however, the threads are much
more numerous, and the granular substance in which they are embedded has
correspondingly decreased. We must suppose, in fact, that new threads have been
formed at the expense of the granular substance.

Both male and female nuclei are seen in the stage just described to be already
preparing for the first segmentation division. In fact no resting fertilized nucleus is
ever formed. The composite structure seen in fig. 21 is the nearest we ever get to
it. But though the distinction is clearly quite arbitrary, we will, for the sake of
convenience, describe the succeeding stages in which the first segmentation spindle
is definitely beginning to be formed under the head of

Division oF THE FertitizeED NUCLEUS.

Fig. 22 represents an early stage in the formation of the spindle. The wall of the
