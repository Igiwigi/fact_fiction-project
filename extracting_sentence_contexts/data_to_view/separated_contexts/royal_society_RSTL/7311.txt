K) which have a corresponding
equation or corresponding equations, let it be as8umed that the equations which
correspond to a given set of yalues of (A, B, ... K) have a determinate character (one
and the same for all such equations) : this assumption is of course a condition imposed
on the form of the functions (A, B, ... K); and any functions satisfying the condition
are 8id to be © auxiliars.” It may be remarked that the 7 coefficients (6, c, ...) are
themselves auxiliars; in fact for given values of the coefficients there is only a single
equation, which equation has of course a determinate character. 'To fix the ideas we may
consider the auxiliars (A, B, ... K) as the coordinates of a point in m-dimensional space,
or 8ay In mM-SPACE.

sponding thereto an equation or equations (and if more than one equation then by what
precedes these equations have all of them the same character), or else it is © non-faculta-
tive,” that is, the point has no corresponding equation.
