in the first graph for the disturbances calculated from the harmonic curve formula.
In the lines showing quinquennial averages, on the two lower graphs, there are distinct
“humps ” more or less consilient with the waves in the sunspot graph, but a little earlier

* It may be noted that positive or negative disturbances as calculated from (31) or (32) are what is
meant. But the constant term in each of these equations may be understood as a steady positive
“ disturbance,” and if added to the disturbances of Table A, from which the graphs are plotted, would
render positive the bulk of the negative disturbances there given.

in phase. Examination of the figures of Table A suggests, in fact, that positive disturb-
ances tend to begin at or just after the minimum, and continue till the maximum or a
year or two before, disturbances from the maximum to the minimum, or a year or two
after the minimum, being preponderantly negative. Preceding the maximum there is
often a group of two or more large positive disturbances. Table III gives a summary
