dulla spinalis is a mere neryous chord, is at variance with all the facts and
experiments detailed in the course of this paper.

It is obviously from the mistake which has been pointed out, that Lecarrors
experienced the difficulty expressed in the following words : © Comment se
fait-il qu'apres la d6capitation, les seuls mouvemens inspiratoires soient an6antis
et que les autres subsistent ? -C'est 1a, a mon ens, un des grands mysteres des
puissances nerveuses, inystere qui sera d6yoils tot ou tard, et dont la decouverte
jettera la plus vive lumiere sur le m6chanisme des fonctions de cette meryeil-
leuse puissance+,” It was impossiþble to explain this difficulty whilst the moye-
ments of the excited reflex function were confounded with those of yoluntary
motion ; but when this distinction is duly made, nothing is more easy. De-
capitation removes, in fact, the sources both of voluntary and of respiratory
motion ; both these kinds of motion consequently cease: but a class of motions
Still remains, viz. those of the reflex function, attached to the remaining por-
tion of medulla. Thus is the veil raised from this apparent * mystery*.

As LecaLLors has confounded the reflex function with the sensibility and
voluntary motions, M. Bracuerh has confounded it with the functions of the
ganglionic system, or the sympathetic. The latter physiologist concludes, that
whatever function remains after the division of the spinal marrow, in the organs
below that division, must be referrible to the influence of the ganglionic system.
In this manner he attempts to prove that some parts of the act and function
