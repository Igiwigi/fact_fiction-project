In such a case as this extremely complicated curves
might result. Moreover, we cannot strictly apply the equation to the concentrated
solutions, since for these the active mass () of the solvent is no longer constant. The fact that the curves, as a whole, are so analogous to those for a simple
electrolyte in aqueous solution appears to indicate that, as a general rule, the main
effect is due to the ionisation of a single substance. The equation «V" = ¢K’ should also be applicable to abnormal solutions in other
solvents. This is the case for the solutions investigated by PLornrKorr (‘ Zeit.
