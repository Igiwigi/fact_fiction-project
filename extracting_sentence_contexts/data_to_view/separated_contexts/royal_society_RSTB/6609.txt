Whether this interpretation of the sulci in ‘Neanderthal man is
correct or not, it is very impressive that it so closely accords with the conditions
seen in Q.1905.R., S.6.L., $.4.L., S.5.R., Q.2788.R., and other hemispheres. Kappers goes on to say :—‘‘ Concerning anthropoids I must confess that this
fissure is very often described (recently again by Mrncazzint (1928)) as S. frontalis
inferior. This is caused by the fact that the frontalis inferior in anthropoids may fail,
or—on account of its steep course in those animals—is not recognized as such, and
the sulc. medius, often connected with the precentral reminds one of the frontalis
inferior of men.” My agreement with Kappers on this point is best emphasized by referring to figs.
