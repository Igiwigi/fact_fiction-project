Anagnitude be limited to /, the result would be

but this does not happen to be expressible in a finite integral form for all values of 7,
a fact which necessitates the immediate rejection of the conjecture. The expression
in question is only finite and integral when 7 is of the form 3p or 3p +1. We have,

* Mr, A. B. Kenrt, Treas. R.S., has verified this conclusion by a different and most ingenious method
of summation, which also readily yields the result for any desired restriction on the part-magnitude.
