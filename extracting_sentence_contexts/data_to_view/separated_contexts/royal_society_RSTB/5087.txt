The Salween
is the lowest ; its level is 2,300 feet at the Salween Bridge, while the Mekong is crossed
by the same road at 4,400 feet, and farther E. the Yang-pi is crossed at 5,200 feet. In
Chinese Tibet, however, the Salween is the highest river of the three ; for, according
to TEICHMAN (1922, map), Di, on the Salween just 8. of 29° N., is at 10,500 feet, the
Mekong at 29° is at 7,907 feet, and the Yangtze must be much lower than the Salween
as Ba-tang, which stands higher than the Yangtze, is only at 9,000 feet. The fact that
farther 8. the floors of the western valleys are lower than those of the eastern valleys
is explicable by the greater corrosion by the western rivers owing to the numerous
factors that may be grouped as the accidents of denudation. There is no general west-
ward descent of the plateau surface (fig. 11).
