Working on PTOV has reminded us how the knowledge of most chemists is becoming
increasingly focused and limited to their own particular area of chemistry. There are few chemists
now who can claim the encyclopaedic breadth of knowledge that Sadler [26] displayed in his
inspiring presentation on the elements of life and medicines at this meeting. This narrow focus
is particularly sad, because, in the search for new more sustainable chemistry, few research
chemists have familiarity with the more arcane chemistry of elements, knowledge which might
for example open up new areas of catalysis. Hopefully, this UK-German discussion meeting and
the associated papers will re-excite chemists’ imaginations to the possibilities. In the longer term,
there is reason for optimism. The Internet and Open Access are bringing chemistry to a much
wider audience and, as in astronomy, one can easily imagine an increasing role for interested
amateurs with sufficient free time to recognize patterns within chemical data which have been
overlooked by overburdened professional researchers. Furthermore, we should not forget that,
within research laboratories, the technicians often have a wider factual knowledge of chemical
reactions than the more highly qualified and specialized researchers.

In recent years, the periodic table has become an advertising icon across the world (figure 5).
Most chemists probably do not realize how fortunate our discipline is to have such a widely
recognized symbol, something that physics lacks. For example, in the city of Oxford (UK), there
are a taxi and a bus both decorated with the periodic table, which is particularly appropriate,
because 2013 marked the centenary of the publication of Oxford physicist Moseley’s [29] historic
paper on X-ray spectra of the elements. That paper was the first definitive assignment of atomic
number and helped explain anomalies such as the apparently reversed order of cobalt and nickel
