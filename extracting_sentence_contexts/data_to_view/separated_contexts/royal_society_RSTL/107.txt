Mention of a firange Phenomenon relating to the
Sea-Compaſs, which 1 had frequently obſerved, when
we were among the Ice in Hudſon's-Bay; to wit,
thar the magnetic Virtue of the Needle was ſo far
loſt or deſtroyed, that it would not traverſe as uſual,
even when the Ship was in a conſiderable Motion :
And in my Voyage thither laſt Year, I obſerved our
Compaſs would not moye at all, any longer than the

Quarter-Maſter kept touching it. We had then much -

Show on the Land, and many Iſles of Ice around us,
and the Sea not very ſmooth : I order'd one of the
Compaſſes to be brought into the Cabin, but did not

find it any better, till it had ſtood near the Fire about _

a Quarter of an Hour, and then it began to traverſe

very-well; Ithen order'd it to be placed in the Bin-
nacle,


[ 3114 ]
nacle, and another to be brought into the Cabin,
changing them alternately thus every Half Hour, and
found by this Means I could make them trayerſe
as well as in atty other Part of the World: I was
obliged to continue this PraQtice, till we got near 100
Leagues from the Coaſt ; but afterwards I had no Oc-
caſion for that Trouble. What ſhould be the Cauſe
of this wonderful Phenomenon, Tam not able to con-
Sjecture, being certain the Compaſſes, as to their me-
<chanical StruQture, were very perfcet, and anſwer'd
Svery well both before and after, during the whole
=Voyage; there is never any Oil uſed to make them
=move caſily, for in that Caſe it might often congeal,
mand ſtop the Motion of the Chard : But whether the
ICold of the Climate hath a Power to deprive the
:SNeedle of its Virtue for a Time, or that the Friftion
2js increas thereby to ſuch a Degree, as it cannot be
Zovercome by the Magnetiſm, Iam not able to ſay; but
the Fact is certain and ſurprizing. April 20. 1738. ©
