And that an intense
attraction, and an equilibrium of attraction, may give to a
compound, containing several constituents, that refractory
character, which is generally attributed to unity of constitution,
or to the homogeneous nature of its parts ? Besides the compound of the phosphoric sublimate and
ammonia, and the other analogous compounds which have
been referred to, it is probable that other compounds of like
nature may be formed of the oxides, alkalies, and earths,
with the oxymuriatic combinations, or of the oxymuriatic

compounds 'with each other; and should- this be the case,
the more refined analogies of chemical philosophy will be
extended by these new, and as it would seem at-first view,
contradictory facts. For if, as I have said, oxymuriatic acid
-gas be referred to the same class of bodies as oxygene gas,
then, as oxygene is not an acid, but forms acids by combining
with certain inflammable bodies, 80 oxymuriatic acid, by
-uniting to similar substances, may be conceived to form either
acids, which is the case when it combines with hydrogene,
or compounds like acids or oxides, capable of forming neu-
tral combinations, as in the instances of the oxymuriates of
phosphorus and tin. Like oxygene, oxymuriatic acid is attracted by the positive
surface in VoLTaic combinations; and-on the hypothesis of
the connection of chemical attraction with electrical powers,
all its energies of combination correspond with those of-a
body supposed to be negative in a high degree.
