D0 ice is used as a replacement for HzO in experiments carried out in neutron beamlines
(e.g. [23-27]), where replacement of H2O by D20O is necessary to avoid incoherent scattering
of the diffracted beam [28,29]. These in situ studies have allowed the evolution of texture
during deformation to be observed, and grain-scale changes linked to the dominant deformation
mechanism to be identified [26]. This study has shown that the detailed deformation behaviours
of H2O (deformed at 263 K) and D2O (deformed at 266 K) are similar; however, the peak stress


of D2O is higher than the peak stress of the H2O sample. These results have been taken as 3 |
confirmation that HzO and D20 behave in the same way during deformation [25,27], although

this supposition seems to neglect the fact that the peak stress is higher for the D2O sample. Wilson 3
et al. [26] also show data for a D2O ice + calcite experiment which demonstrates similar gross :a
behaviour, with additional strain hardening at high total strains, with no apparent increase of sg

peak stress when compared with the pure D2O-ice sample deformed at the same conditions.
However, the calcite volume fraction is not given, so may be below the critical rock fraction
(10-15 vol.%) mentioned above, and so peak stress and steady-state stress may be expected to
be the same as in the pure D2O-ice situation. In another study, it was found that the mechanical
relaxation time of D2O-ice is higher by a factor of 1.5 when compared with H20 ice [28], due to
the different masses of deuterons and protons.

Here, we add to the available experimental data on the properties of ice-rock materials and
D20 ice by carrying out deformation experiments on ice, ice-rock and D2O-ice-rock samples =
