100° C., as was expected, the solution volume at all percentages was found to reach a
maximum value at 60° C. to 70° C., and then to decrease between 70° C. and 100° C.

There is thus a close resemblance between the solution volume at 90° C. and that
at 30° C. The extent of the variation produced by alterations of temperature
decreases with increasing concentration, and at 50 per cent. NaOH amounts only to
7 per cent. The data for the solution volume are given in Table XI. and are
represented graphically in diagrams V. and VI.

In discussing the significance of the variations of solution volume it may be
regarded as certain that the great variation in the case of dilute, as compared with
concentrated, solutions must be attributed to the complex character of liquid water
and not to any complexity introduced by the addition of soda. It appears, in fact,
that the maximum of simplicity is reached in a 50-per cent. solution at 100° C., and
that the most complex solution with which we have to deal is water.

The complex character of the water molecule was demonstrated by Raouur (‘ Ann,
Chim, Phys.,’ 1884, (6), vol. 2, p. 66), and was made use of by RéntGEN (‘ Wied.
Ann.,’ 1891, vol. 45, p. 91), who attributed the increase of density between 0° C.
and 4° C. to the dissociation of “ice molecules” having a greater molecular volume
than the water molecules. This view was elaborated by SurHERLAnD (‘ Phil. Mag.,’
1900, vol. 50, p. 460), who suggested that RénreEn’s ice molecules had the formula
H,0, and might be called tihydrol, whilst the water molecules consisted of dihydrol,
H,0,. A further discussion is given by Srrapuine (‘Jour. Frank. Inst.,’ 1901,
vol. 152, pp. 257-268) with reference especially to the compressibility of water. It
