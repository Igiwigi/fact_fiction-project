Although the time taken may actually be considerably greater than this, these
considerations are sufficient to show that it is likely to be exceedingly short. Further, the piston must be moving with constantly increasing velocity till brought
to a sudden stop at the constriction into which it fits. The fact that contact takes place simultaneously over a considerable area, probably
saves the tube from being broken by the blow it receives from the piston. The film
of water which covers both surfaces, doubtless helps to break the shock. On two
occasions, a machine was made only slightly larger than the one whose dimensions
are given above, but in each case it was shivered by the impact almost the first time
the piston was allowed to fly.
