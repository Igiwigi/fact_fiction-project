19 per cent. (being above 9 per cent. in eight instances), appears to afford substantial
proof that accidental atmospheric oxidation during the collection and analysis of the

residues is not sufficient to account for all but the very small quantities of hypo-
sulphite which M. BerTnELoT considers could only have pre-existed in the residue
examined by us. That chemisb appears, moreover, to have overlooked the following
facts given by us in our firs} memoir â€”

1, Separate examinations (conducted precisely alike) of the upper and lower portions
of some of the residues showed that considerably larger proportions of hyposulphite
existed in the upper portions. In one case quoted by us in our firs memoir, the
upper portion contained 17:14 per cent. of hyposulphite, while the lower portion only
contained 4:34 per cent, At the same time there was only a difference of 1'27 per
cent, in the proportions of monosulphide existing in the two portions of the residue
(6-03 in the upper part, and 7:3 in the lower), while there was a very great difference
in the amount of free snlphur (4:88 in the upper part, and 10-09 in the lower),

2. One of the small buttons of the fired solid products, of which there was generally
one found attached to the firing plug in the cylinder, was examined for gulphide and
