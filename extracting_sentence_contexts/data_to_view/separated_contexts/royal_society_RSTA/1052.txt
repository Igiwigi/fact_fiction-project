It was thought that the reversible changes in the X-ray photograph
were simply a record of a molecular elongation of about 30%, an elongation associated
with the sudden steep rise of the normal (“restricted ”) load/extension curve which
was afterwards followed by some undefined stretching process not involving any further
photographic change. The particular quantitative implication of this hypothesis
must now be abandoned, but it is worth while mentioning again the chief arguments
leading up to it. These were (i) the fact that the readily distinguishable reflections
in the 6-photograph lie on hyperbole corresponding to a period along the fibre-axis
of about 6-7 A, which is some 30% greater than the spacing (5-1 A) of the prominent
meridian are of the «-photograph ; (ii) the fact that the well-marked “shoulder” of
the normal load/extension curve and the first clear appearance of the 8-photograph
occur both in the neighbourhood of extensions of 20-30%; and (iii) the fact that
permanent damage of the fibre structure, as measured by SpHaKMAN,* is inappreciable
for quick extensions of less than 30°. For these reasons it was argued that the rapid
rise of the load/extension curve, accompanied by a minimum of permanent internal
damage, is an expression of the rapid and easy unfolding of molecular chains followed
by re-crystallization in a phase of which the pattern along the chains is 30°% longer ;
but it is clear now that such a conception is far too limited in its outlook to explain
the whole of the elastic properties. Argument (i) is invalidated by the realization that
the true unit of pattern is probably very large and that there is a simple general explana-
tion of the occurrence of both the period 6-7 A and that of half this spacing (see below),
while argument (ii) obviously cannot hold now that it is shown that there is a variety
of “ restricted ” load/extension curves but only one “ generalized ” curve, even though
the progress of the intramolecular transformation, as revealed by the X-ray photo-
graphs, is very much the same in all cases.
