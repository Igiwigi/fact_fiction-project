it is permissible to use these words ina rather wider sense than that usually understood
by the term chemical combination,

The other objection depends on the way in which the steady leak varies with the
pressure at low pressures. The preceding.view would make the leak directly
proportional to the pressure atâ€™ low pressures at all temperatures, whereas the
experiments show that at low temperatures and pressures the leak varies as the
square root of the pressure. This result is also readily explained if we suppose the
ionisation to be proportional to the amount of combined or absorbed oxygen rather
than to the rate of chemical action between the oxygen and the platinum.

For the reasons stated, it seems necessary to seek the cause of the ionisation
within the surface layer of the metal. On the molecular theory a metal, and in fact
any solid, will possess a surface layer in which the molecules are more loosely held
together than in the interior. On account of the well-known tenacity with which
films of gas adhere to solid bodies, it seems reasonable to suppose that this layer will
be capable of being penetrated by the surrounding gas, and that when equilibrium is
established the absorbed gas will have a density which is very great compared with
that of the free gas outside. This comes to assuming that a gas molecule loses
potential energy when it enters the surface layer. To explain the results it is
necessary to assume, in addition, that, for reasons connected with the structure of the
metal, only dissociated oxygen atoms and not the ordinary molecules are capable of
entering the surface layer. This assumption receives some support from the fact
that the hydrogen which diffuses through hot platinum has been shown to be in the
atomic form.* In order to make the problem definite we shall suppose the surface
