ON THE SPECIFIC GRAVITY OF GOLD, WHEN ALLOYED BY
VARIOUS METALS.

The many difficulties which attend the making of experiments
intended to ascertain the specific gravity of bodies, with any
tolerable degree of precision, are sufficiently known to every
one who has had practical experience; and some of these diffi-
culties have been ably pointed out, and avoided, by Sir GEokGE
SHUCKBURGH EVELYN, Bart. F. R. S. in his valuable Paper,
entitled An Account of some Endeavours to ascertain a standard
of Weight and Measure, Phil. Trans. for 1798, p. 133. In
fact, when we consider the inaccuracies of balances, and the
effects produced by the different height of the column of water,
and by the changes of temperature to which the water is
exposed during the experiments, we have less reason to be
surprised at the frequent variations in the results ; and, in addi-
tion to these sources of error, if we consider the different
texture of bodies, and the numberless interstices of them, often
unequally arranged, and which cannot at all times be penetrated
by water, we may rather wonder that s0 much precision has
been attained. The last-mentioned obstacles to exactitude in
such experiments, are peculiarly to be observed, when the spe-
cific gravity of certain substances, such as stones and ores, is to
be determined ; and, although the metals, being in general more
