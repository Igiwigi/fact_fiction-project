Under adiabatic or superadiabatic
air conditions, common during the day in clear weather, Giblett concluded (p. 56):


MIGRATION OF THE DESERT LOCUST 207

*...there are major eddies composed of alternating masses of fast and slow moving air,
while embedded in the air masses there is a large number of small scale eddies. These air
masses are considerably longer in the direction of the wind than they are broad. The
changes of velocity in wind from air mass to air mass are characterised by abrupt increases
and comparatively gradual decreases... .These facts have been found in eddies which are
on the scale of 4000 ft. long by 600 ft. wide (these measurements are probably below the
average). There is another group of major eddies which ranges up to a dimension in the
direction of the wind of the order of 10-20 miles.â€™

The major eddies, according to Giblett, show the same abrupt rise and slow fall in wind
velocity, while the numerous, small-scale eddies are not elongated in the wind direction. The elongation of the air masses in the direction of the wind might provide an observer,
who was himself being borne by the wind, with a clue as to its general direction.
