This difference is probably due to the superior pick-up of Service azide compared with
dextrinated azide.
° The threshold temperatures for dextrinated azide lie below those for Service azide throughout
= the region of temperatures investigated, but the curves may cross outside this region. As has
$® been previously pointed out (part II (1)), the temperatures corresponding with pick-up
‘S sensitiveness lie above the inversion point of about 400° C, above which induction periods
‘6 for Service azide are shorter than for, dextrinated azide. Allowance for this crossing over
5 must be made before attempting to correlate pick-up with sensitiveness to heat.
2 The fact that compression increases sensitiveness to percussion and heat is in contrast with
9 anumber of high explosives which are less sensitive at higher densities, and appears to be
$. associated with the special pick-up mechanism of initiators.
& _ Itis ofinterest to note that the Frank-Kamenetsky relation between threshold temperature
a and mass, may be written in the form

& = kp err RTS o, )
5 m 2a (ahr? E .0°88),

‘3 where a = area of cross-section of the tube, p = density of pellet, and 1, = heat/unit mass.
© _ Since the value of & is almost certainly increased by increasing the density, an increase
5 in density should normally raise m for the same 7), if the self-heating mechanism operates. Qs Thisis the opposite to the effect observed in practice (see figures 23 and 24) for compression
of the lead azides, and is further evidence for their special pick-up mechanism.
