With the above criteria in mind, the significance of the results obtained by many workers
is rendered doubtful.

The experimental technique of Fisher et al. (1938), and Dey et al. (1941) afford more
satisfactory results in estimating the part played by the neurohypophysis in labour. In
these experiments, small localized lesions were placed in the hypothalamus, interrupting
the supraoptico-hypophysial tracts, in pregnant cats and guinea-pigs. In the majority of
animals disturbances of parturition were seen, many of the animals dying in labour.
However, since about one-third of the guinea-pigs with these lesions delivered themselves
normally, it was felt that the results could not be offered as convincing evidence that the
secretory activity of the neurohypophysis played an essential part in labour. In view of
the fact that the pars distalis was not subjected to direct interference and that the median
eminence and infundibular stem were denervated, it would seem that these experiments
are of greater value in the analysis of parturition than the work quoted above in which
operative hypophysectomy was employed.

HyYPER-FUNCTIONAL STATES AND THE OXYTOCIC ‘HORMONE’

The effect of increased activity of the neurohypophysis on the uterus had received little
attention until recently. The effect of stimulation of the pituitary stalk on uterine move-
ments was described by Haterius & Ferguson (1938) and Ferguson (1941). These observers
found a marked increase in uterine motility in anaesthetized post-partum rabbits and cats
on stimulation of the stalk, which was abolished if an electrolytic lesion had been previously
made in the stalk but was not abolished by crushing the neck so that only vascular con-
