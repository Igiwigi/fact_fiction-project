6 and 7.—Case V. Lesion at 6th dorsal. Three hemisections made at 2 or 3 mm.
apart. Fig. 7 is through the lesion, and the cord is so destroyed as to be
hardly recognisable. Great difliculty was experienced in cutting sections
through the lesions, owing to the formation of very dense fibrous tissue.
Practically the grey matter at the seat of the lesion is destroyed, as can be
seen by the photograph. The white matter of the postero-external and
lateral columns on the side opposite to the lesion is for the most part intact.
Fig. 6, section at 4th dorsal, shows that the degeneration is not limited to
the side of the lesion, although that is much more extensive. Perhaps this
may have been due to the pressure of the fibrous nodule found at the seat
of the lesion adherent to the cord. The interest of this case lies, however,
in the fact that on the side of the lesion, and where the greatest amount of
degeneration existed, there was anesthesia and analgesia (vide p. 9 and
fig. 4, Plate 3).

8.—Case VI. Lesion at 6th dorsal. The destruction is very complete in one half of
the cord, and the anterior and posterior median columns of the other side
contain very many degenerated fibres. Moreover, above the lesion there
was scattered degeneration of the antero-lateral and direct cerebellar tracts
of the opposite side, probably due to the injury of the grey matter 10 days
previous to the hemisection (vide p. 11).

9.—Case IV. Lesion at the level of the 6th dorsal segment. A portion of the
posterior column not injured, but the whole of the antero-lateral (vide also
