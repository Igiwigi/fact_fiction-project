Let us now take a closer look at the memory matrix. The information of the vortices appears ls |
in the memory space, but we use that information in the structure space, because it is here that we
reduce the number of the unknowns. We are in fact transferring information from the memory
space to the structure space with a conventional rule of the type ‘If a vortex appears in the memory
space, fix the corresponding point in the structure space to a minimum or a maximun’. A reconstruction from incomplete information, in short, does not require only a memory. It requires memory and codes.
