In homiothermic mammalia the regression of the secondary sexual characters occurs
soon after postpuberal castration (TANDLER und Grosz, 1913). On the other hand,
in poikilothermic mammalia, CourRIER (1927) has found that the rate of regression of
the secondary sexual modifications after similar castration varies directly with the
temperature of the animal. It is not improbable therefore that the slow rate of
regression of the secondary sexual characters of Gasterosteus after castration is due to
the fact that the animals were kept at a uniform moderately low temperature. In this connection it is suggestive to notice that the state of regression of the inter-
stitital tissue at which the animal passes into Stage V, varies with the temperature. In the fish in their natural habitat the state of regression of the interstitial tissue at
Stage V varies, and in some cases the interstitial tissue is but a little fibrous.
