Some of the fibres of each anterior nerve may be traced directly into the more
dorsal portion of the ganglionic plexus. These probably are connected with nerve

= cells by lateral branches, but the connection cannot be seen. in sections. It is
& probable from the fact that a large number of the fibres of the anterior commissure
8 end in the plexus, that a crossed connection exists between each anterior nerve and
i the plexus of the opposite anterior ganglionic enlargement.

& The following, then, are the central connections of each anterior nerve :—

g 1. With both external and median dorsal. cell groups of each side, but mainly with
S those of the same side.

cs 2. With the dorsal plexus of each side.
