the half-rhythm when it is clearly due to a diminution in the excitability of the ven-
trieular musele, points unmistakably to the conclusion that the half-rhythm caused by
clamping, in which, as has been shown, the ventricle contracts with greater force than
before the clamp was tightened, is nob due to any diminution of muscular excitability
caused by the action of the clamp. This is further shown by the following facts â€”

1. The effect of tightening the clamp upon the rhythm of the ventricle is the game
in kind, whether the clamp be near the ventricle, as in the auriculo-ventricular groove,
or far from it, as at the junction of the sinus and auricles ; 1.e., whether the clamp be
in a position where it might possibly lower the excitability of the muscle by direct
injury, or 0 far removed as to make it, impossible to affect the musele directly.

2. When the clamp is placed across the middle of the ventricle the base may continue
to beat with the same rhythm as the auricles, while the apex beats synchronously with
every 8econd, third, fourth, or more beats of the base; and it seems impossible to
imagine that a direct mechanical injury across the middle of a muscle should 80
markedly lower the excitability of one side without perceptibly diminishing tha of
