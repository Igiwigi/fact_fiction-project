It is to be remarked that the two integrals are connected with each other; viz. the
circle of the second integral being divided in rings by means of a system of circles con-
centric with the bounding circle a*+y*=f?, then the prepotential of each ring or annulus
is determined by an integral such as the first integral; or, analytically, writing in the
second integral z=7 cos 0, y="r' 8in 9, and therefore dady=rdrds, the second integral is

m (sin 6)*-1 49
=| ar? —2xr &r cos 0) tr

viz. the integral in regard to 0 is here the same function of 7, z that the first integral is
of f, z; and the integration in regard to 7 is of course to be taken from y=0 to r=f.
But the &integral is not in its original form such a function of 7 as to render possible
the integration in regard to r; and 1, in fact, obtain the second integral by a different
and in some respects a better process.
