Its total emission
values as well as the calculated possible savings in the three scenarios are given in the electronic
supplementary material, table $1. Our calculations showed possible fuel savings of 1.72-6.89 kg
and cost savings of 0.98 US$ to 3.93 US$ per nautical mile in the three scenarios for the bulk carrier. For the Ikuna, we calculated the values for a fictional journey in India from Vishakhapatnam
Terminal to Calcutta Terminal of around 440 nautical miles (one way). The calculated possible fuel
savings for this journey are between 757.9 and 3031.6 kg, meaning CO2-emission savings between
2372.2 kg and 9488.9 kg and cost savings of 432.0 US$ to 1728.0 US$. The detailed results for the
three scenarios are given in electronic supplementary material, table S2.
