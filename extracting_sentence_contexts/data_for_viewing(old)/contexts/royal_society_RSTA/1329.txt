An alternative means of using the availability of forecasts in the control setting is to apply the : =
ideas of model predictive control (MPC). MPC has become a standard tool for many industrial : =
applications and provides a practical way of dealing with forecasts [14-16]. In this approach, one 1B
uses the forecasts available to solve a sequence of MDP formulations over time. At each decision : =
epoch, a conventional MDP that incorporates the forecasts available is solved, the optimal first 8
period action is taken, and this process is repeated at the next decision epoch. In particular, the : 4
MDPs that are used by MPC at each decision epoch do not explicitly model, within the MDP, De
the fact that the decision-maker will have available a new set of forecasts at each future decision : 3
epoch within the decision horizon associated with the MDP. This is also the case in adaptations : 3
of standard MPC to the setting where the forecasts contain probabilistic information [16]. By 8

contrast, the MDPs introduced by this paper model the fact that the forecasts are continually
‘refreshed’ over the MDP’s decision horizon, and do so via a formulation that preserves the
computational tractability of the MDP.

In §7, we introduce a simple energy system control model that controls interior building
temperatures in an external weather environment for which forecasts are available. In the
presence of a quadratic cost structure, we are able to use the existing linear-quadratic stochastic
control theory to compute the optimal value associated with MDPs for the energy system in which
no forecast information is available and also the optimal value for the dynamic forecasting MDP
of §5. This allows us to analyse the degree of improvement that can be obtained by incorporating
dynamic forecast information into the MDP formulation in the context of our simple energy
system example. Section 8 concludes the paper with a discussion of additional research questions
that this paper motivates.
