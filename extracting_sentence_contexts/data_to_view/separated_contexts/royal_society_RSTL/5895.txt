The liquid was then distilled, a good condensing apparatus being attached. At first
white pungent fumes passed over with the aqueous vapour, and collected in the receiver
in the form of oily drops, possessed of great causticity and powerful basic properties. This product, in fact, is the aqueous solution of the oxide of an ethylated base contain-
ing tin, from which definite compounds may be obtained with sulphuric, hydrochloric,
and other acids. As the sulphate is but little soluble in water, it seemed well adapted for fixing the
constituents of the base. A portion of the aqueous solution of the oxide was therefore
nearly neutralized with sulphuric acid, and heated to abont 80?
