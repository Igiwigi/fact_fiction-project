branches of the Caytoniales, but in the latter the tips of the fertile branches are not
expanded, while the synangia have four loculi instead of two. | Both groups produced
similar winged microspores. The proof of the pteridospermous nature of Lepidopteris
is important, as the fertile branches Antholithus Arberi resemble those of its micro-
sporophylls or male inflorescences (formerly known as Antholithus Zeilleri). We have,
then, some further grounds for deriving the Caytoniales from the palewozoic pterido-
sperms.

The Pteridosperms and the Flowering Plants.

In a recent paper (THomAs, 1931, p. 665) the author has suggested the derivation of
the modern angiosperms from the pteridosperms, and the present communication
adds some new facts which support this view. It is now clear that two groups of plants

allied to the Paleozoic pteridosperms existed in the Mesozoic period immediately prior
to the time when the Caytoniales first appear, and at a period when the earlier stages
in the evolution of the flowering plants must have been accomplished. In these groups
the seeds and pollen grains were borne on special branch systems or inflorescences,
some suggesting dichasial cymes, others apparently racemose in character. This
fact suggests a modification in our usual concepts of the characters of the Pterido-
