The suggestion that cognitive dissonance may arise as a
result of compulsivity is not altogether new, but has been pre-
viously alluded to in the context of substance dependence. Everitt & Robbins [74] suggested that the subjective urge to
consume drugs (i.e. wanting), often considered a precursor
to consumption, may be a post hoc rationalization of the
objectively ‘out of control’ behaviour. In the case of OCD,
the argument is analogous, wherein the irrational thoughts
often considered to induce compulsive responding, may in
fact be the product of the mind’s attempt to resolve the dis-
crepancy between patients’ cognitions and their otherwise
inexplicable urge to perform compulsive behaviours. Specifi-
cally, the experience of the irresistible urge to perform, or the
very performance of, compulsive avoidance behaviours
may engender cognitive dissonance that is reconciled by the
development of a new irrational belief about threat in
the environment. This new ‘fear’ makes sense of the need
to compulsively perform avoidance responses and may of
course contribute to the motivation of subsequent avoidance
responding, forming a vicious cycle of sorts.
