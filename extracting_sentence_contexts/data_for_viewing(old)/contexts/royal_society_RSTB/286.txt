dozen groups of cells. Unlike M. Renavtr’s similar example, the petiolar bundles
given off by this central axis are not Zygopteroid in form, since they lack the two
parallel extensions /’, f” seen in Plate 1, fig. 4, of the present memoir; what

remains corresponding apparently to the portion f of the same figure. In my

previous memoirs I have pointed out the fact that all these Zygopteroid bundles give
| off alternately from the exterior of each of the two parallel portions f’, f” a consider-
: able mass of vascular tissue, each of- which detached portions usually subdivides into
two parallel secondary bundles.* The Rachiopteris duplex, also described and figured
| (Part VI, ‘Phil. Trans.,’ vol. 164, Plate 55, figs. 28 and 35), exhibits the same
phenomena, and must also be regarded as one of the Zygopteroid group ; and it is
more than probable that my Rachiopteris insignis, figured in Part VI., Plate 16,
figs, 19, 20, and 21, may be regarded as connecting the petiole of Rachiopteris
corrugata, already referred to, with the Zygopteroid type. The Rachiopteris
duplex also appears, so far as its petiole is concerned, and especially from the
mode in which the vascular bundles of the secondary petioles are detached from those
of the primary one, to have corresponding affinities with the same type.
