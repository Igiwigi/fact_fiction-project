We shall also obtain some general integrals of the equations
(126) to (134). First, we may observe that according to equations (134) both Z and P should vanish
identically. This follows from the fact that L satisfies Laplace’s equation (in five dimensions) ;
it must therefore vanish if it is bounded everywhere and tends to zero at infinity; P then
satisfies Laplace’s equation and by the same arguments it must also vanish identically. Thus

L=P=0; (135)
therefore, in stationary turbulence (cf. table 1)

Ou; =0'u, and oui =—o'u, (136)

and A,=6u; and Il, = ow. (137)

Now apply the operator A; to equation (127 Ae and make use of equations (128) and (129). We obtain (k-+v) AZA = |] A,Q,—

=!8\ 1-2) D,+4] ¥—yD,0. (138)

Apply A; once more to this equation.
