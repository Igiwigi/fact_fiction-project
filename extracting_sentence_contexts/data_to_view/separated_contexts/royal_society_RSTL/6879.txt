This is in all probability owing to the more internal or
deeper layers being the firs formed. Thus the seventh or deepest internal layer, which I
am inclined to think is developed before the sixth, goes on increasing part passt with
it; while the seventh and sixth increase equally with the fifth, which is a later forma-
tion; and 80 on until the firs, which is the thinnest layer, is reached. That this
explanation has its foundation in truth, is probable from the fact that, in imitating the
process by which I believe the left ventricle is formed, the seyenth or most internal
layer supplies a basis of support for the more superficial layersâ€”just in the same way
that the smaller and more central turns of a shell form the basis of support for the
peripheral or more superficial turns*. External layers of the left ventricle of the Mammal. Superficial or first external layer.
