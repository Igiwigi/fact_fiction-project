At 300*C. the black surface was still repelled Slightly more than the white
surface, but at 250* C. down to 100* C. the repellent action of the radiant heat was
the same on the white as on the black surface. The two surfaces were then thermi-
cally of the ame colour. The fact that the work done on each 8urface was equal, is, I think, proof that the
absorption of the incident rays was equal.

172. Let me now carry the reasoning a step further. Experiments described in
pars. 159 to 168 show that when heat of low refrangibility—from the body (159), the
breath (160), hot air, or a warm glass shade (161, 165, 168)—falls on the white and
