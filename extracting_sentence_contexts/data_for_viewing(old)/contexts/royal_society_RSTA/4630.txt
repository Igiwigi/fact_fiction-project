significant effects [21].

More than 40 years had passed when the world was again affected by a major trans-oceanic
tsunami. Overall, the 26 December 2004 tsunami had a relatively modest impact on ports and
shipping in the Indian Ocean although maritime facilities in the near and mid-field (i.e. Indonesia
and Thailand) suffered tremendously. Notable were the extreme devastation of the port facilities : =

at Lhok Nga, near Banda Aceh, where the freighter Andalas was capsized at her moorings and a Sy
90 m coal barge was deposited on the beach [22]. Also destroyed was Banda Acehâ€™s principal port : 2
facility at Ulee Lheue where a large area of the working water front suffered co-seismic subsidence aed
and large-scale scour and erosion by over washing tsunami flow depths of approximately 10m 22
[22]. Remarkably neither a pile supported ferry wharf nor mooring dolphins for a power barge at : Ss
Ulee Lheue were significantly damaged by the tsunami [18] despite the fact that the barge itself DNS
was deposited 4 km inland in a residential area. Fritz et al. [23] deduced tsunami flow speeds of : =
2-4ms"! at inland sites by using particle tracking and image processing of videos shot in the 2S

streets of Banda Aceh, several kilometres from the shoreline.

Sheth et al. [24] reported that no major ports in mainland India were significantly damaged.
However, many intermediate and minor ports were strongly affected. In Kerala in the southwest,
several smaller ports were affected by sand deposition reducing the available draft for vessels. In
Tamil Nadu, the fishing port at Chennai suffered serious damage resulting in the deaths of 150
fishermen. At the Chennai commercial port, damage was not significant; however, the tsunami
broke the mooring lines of one ship allowing it to collide with two others, causing damage to the
ships and mooring dolphins. Tsunami-induced sedimentation in the port of Chennai reportedly
