RWR view’ and (b) ‘the strong RWR view’.

The description and mathematical representation of individual quantum objects and
behaviour became partial in the so-called old quantum theory (from Planck’s discovery of the
quantum nature of radiation in 1900 until QM), in particular Bohr’s atomic theory, introduced in
1913. Bohr’s theory only provided such a representation, in terms of orbits, for stationary states of
electrons in atoms, but not for the discrete transitions between these states, ‘quantum jumps’. The


energy levels corresponding to stationary states and the transitions between these levels could
be observed, as registered in measuring instruments. By contrast, orbits were merely assumed,
rather than ever observed in the way we would observe the orbits of planet around the Sun. This
fact played a role in Heisenberg’s thinking [7], which abandoned the orbital or any representation
of stationary states, while retaining Bohr’s concept of discrete transitions between quantum states
without representing them either and, thus, renouncing at least a representational realism in QM.
As he said: ‘What I really like in this scheme is that one can really reduce all interactions between
atoms and the external world ... to transition probabilities’, without assuming either realism or
causality in considering these transitions (W. Heisenberg, Letter to R. Kronig, 5 June 1925; cited in
[14, v2, p. 242]). The view that their representation and possibly, closer to the strong RWR view,
even conception is ‘in principle excluded’ was advanced by Bohr in the ultimate version of this
interpretation [10, v2, p. 62]. Still, Heisenberg’s thinking was a radical departure from the whole
preceding history of physics, which had been and aimed to be realist.

I shall distinguish ‘causality’ and ‘determinism’. By causality, as noted, I refer, ontologically,
to the conception that the state of the system considered is determined at all future moments of
