Thus the distinguished author of *Siluria” writes: —* One of the most important of these
discoveries, resulting from the labours of Professor MiLyg-Epwarns, and his coadjutor,
M. Jvres Hae, appears to be, that the majority, if not, all, of the corals of the Silurian
system, and indeed of the whole Palzozoic era, belong to divisions of the coral tribe
unknown in modern seas: with rare exceptions, these groups became extinct at the close
of the Palzozoic epoch. If this be established, and the large cup- and star-corals
(Zoantharia rugosa) and the massive Millepores (Z. tabulata) be, as a whole, distinet
in structure from the star-corals and Madrepores of the Secondary and Tertiary rocks
and of existing coral-reefs, we gain a new fact in the history of animal life upon the
globe, which is in harmony with results obtained by the study of the Crustacea, Mol-
lusca, and Fish of the older epochs” (+ Siluria,” 4th edition, 1867, p. 217). Moreover,
in a note to page 220 of the same work, the restriction of the non-rugose corals to the
Mesozoic and Cainozoic periods is inferred. Although the Zoantharia tabulata are as numerous in the existing coral-faunas as
they were in the Paleozoic (and some of the genera are closely allied), the presumed
fact of the restriction of the Rugosa to the Palzozoic formations tempted many to come
to the erroneous conclusion respecting the break in the continuity of coral life at the
end of the Permian age.
