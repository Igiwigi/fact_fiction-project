Sometimes the contractile wave
will become blocked when the contractile strip is only an inch long, while in other
cases, as already stated, the wave will continue to pass through a strip more than thirty
times that length ; and between these two extremes there are all possible grades of
tolerance. Now it seems to me that if the tissue through which these contractile waves
pass is supposed to be of a functionally homogeneous nature, no reason can be assigned
why there should be such great differences in the endurance of different individuals of
the same species; while if we suppose that the passage of these contractile waves is
more or less dependent on the presence of more or less differentiated lines of discharge,
we encounter no difficulty ; for it is almost to be expected that in such lowly forms of
life snch lines of discharge, if present, should not be constant as to position. In some
cases, therefore, it would happen that important lines of discharge would s0on be
encountered by the section, while in other cases it would happen that such lines of
discharge would escape the section for a longer distance, It is, indeed, almost incredible
that any one line of discharge should happen to pursue a spiral course twice or thrice
round the animal, and at the same time happen to be concentric with the course pur-
wed by the section; but such an hypothesis is not necessary to account for the facts. All we have to assume is that there exists @ more or less intimate plexus of 8nch lines
of discharge, the constituent elements of which are endowed with the capacity of
vicarious action, and that in some cases the section happens to leave a series of their
anastomoses in a continuous state. Doubtless even this assumption represents a state of
things very difficult to believe; but I do not see that the numberless grades of indivi-
dual yariations already mentioned admit of being accounted for in any other way.
