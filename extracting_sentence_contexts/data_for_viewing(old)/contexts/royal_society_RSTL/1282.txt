of chemical attraction.

There are many circumstances, on the contrary, favour-
able to that part of the views of the Huttonians or Plutonists,
relating to the cause of crystallization ; such as the form of
the earth, that of an oblate spheroid flattened at the poles ;
the facility with which heat, being a radiating substance, may
be lost and dissipated in free space ; and the observations
which seem to show the present existence of a high tempera-
ture in the interior of the globe.

I have often, in the course of my chemical researches, looked
for facts or experiments, which might throw some light on
this interesting subject, but without success, till about three
years ago; when, in considering the state of the fluid and
acriform matters included in certain crystals, it appeared to
me, that these curious phenomena might be examined in a
manner to afford some important arguments as to the causes
of the formation of the crystal.

It is well known that water, and all fluids at usual tem-
peratures, are more expansible by heat than siliceous or other
earthy matters ; and supposing these crystals to have been
formed, and the water or fluid inclosed in them, at a pressure
and temperature not very unlike those of our existing atmo-
