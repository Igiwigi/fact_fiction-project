But I attend only to the condition (T). The expressions for the number of conics which
satisfy such conditions as (1), (2), &c. are obtainable in several ways.

63. (1*) When the total number of conditions is 4, the question may be solved by
ZEUTHEN'S method, viz. by determining the line-pairs and point-pairs of the system 4Z,
with the proper numerical coefficients, and thence deducing the values of the character-
istics (4Z - ) and (4Z/). A few cases are in fact thus solved in Zxurux's work.

64. (2%) By the foregoing functional method. Tt is to be observed that there is a
difference in the form of the functional equation, and th

l : at the general solution is always
given in the form, Particular Solution + Constant, 80 that there is only a single con-

stant to be determined by special considerations. 'To take the simplest example, let it
be required to find the number of the conics (3Z) (1, 1): writing for shortness in place
hereof (1, 1), or (in order to mark the curve (1) to which the symbol has reference)
(1, 1),z let the curve (m) be the aggregate of the curyes (1) and (1m). Regarding the
point 1 as a given point on the curve (m), that is, an arbitrary point in regard to the

curve (m'), we have thus the equation

(1, 1).+w —(T, 1),=( = Dis
where the right-hand side is known; and 80 in general the form of the functional equa-
tion is always e(m+m)—@(m)= given value, that is,

e(mb+m', n+, «+«')—@(m, n, «) = given function of (m, n, «, m,n, «);

whence, as stated, the general solution is Particular Solution + Constant.
