96 Mr. J. F. W. HERSCHEL on the action of

the other 6th January, 1817, by Sir G. Macxenz1e, President of the Physical Class
of the Royal Society.‚Äù

No comments on the above extracts are necessary. They establish at once the
priority of Dr. BxzwsTeR's observations, 'and the independence of mine. With
regard to the division of crystals into two classes, which observyation has alike sug-
gested to both of us, it is unnecessary, if we regard either of the two classes as having
the angle between the resultant axes greater than a right angle. In Dr. BxewsTes's
table, Phil. Trans. 1818, p. 230, succinic acid and sulphate of iron are s$tated as
having this angle go? If this determination corresponds, as in all probability it
does, to the yellow rays, they belong at once to both'classes, and are, in fact, instances
of the limit where one class passes into the other. Bi-carbonate of ammonia, in which
I can: perceive no separation'of - the axes of different colours, nor of course, any
virtual poles, belongs in like manner to both classes, or to neither,
