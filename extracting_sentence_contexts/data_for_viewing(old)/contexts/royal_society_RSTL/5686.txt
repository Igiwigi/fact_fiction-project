fined to any limited region of the cord. in

This experiment also indicates, in a very striking manner, how 8mall a piece of the _
cord will suffice to regulate the calibre of the arteries, and how little effect may be pro-
duced, even in the first instance, by the removal of a large portion which also possegses
that function. For it was shown, by the absence of contraction in the vessels when the
anterior segment was irritated, and still more conclusively by the absence of dilatation
when the anterior segment and the brain were removed, that the posterior segment was
the only part capable of acting on the arteries after the removal of the middle segment;
or, in other words, that this operation deprived the arteries of the influence of the whole
cerebro-spinal axis, except the posterior fifth of the cord. Yet, although the heart was
acting powerfully at the time, the dilatation produced by this procedure was only modes
rate in amount, and very transient. Hence it follows that the mere fact of the speedy
return of the arteries to their former state of contraction, after removal of an anterior
portion of the cerebro-spinal axis, as scen in the experiment of April 16th, 1857+, is no
ground whatever for believing that such a portion does not act as a nervous centre for
the arteries. This being clearly understood, the invariable occurrence of contraction,
when the posterior part of the brain or the anterior half of the cord was irritated, in the
experiments of April 14th and 16th, 1857Ãž, must be regarded as strong presumptive
evidence, if not absolute proof, that they as well as the posterior half of the cord pres
side over the arterial contractions in the feet, although, as shown at page 615, they
appear to exert their influence only through those roots of nerves which take origin
from the posterior regions of the cord. On the other hand, the cerebral hemispheres
seem to take no part in this function, 80 far at least as it is safe to draw any inference
from the negative evidence derived from a single experiment performed upon them, vi
