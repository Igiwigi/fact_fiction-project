In the experimental case
(a), the points are obtained by superimposing data with different Sys. In all cases, the avalanche size threshold is fixed as

Sth = 0. (Online version in colour.)

avalanches, also. Let us finally mention that equation (5.4) is not fulfilled for the local avalanches
detected on the space-time numerical maps (figure 12b); this is coherent with the fact that inter-
event times were not scale free for this type of avalanche, either.

6. Concluding discussion

We examined here the crackling dynamics in a nominally brittle crack problem. Experimentally,
a single crack was slowly pushed into an artificial rock made of sintered polymer beads.
