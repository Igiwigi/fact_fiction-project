According to K6LKER they are polygonal, finely granular, transparent
cells, each with a single nucleus. Frey, again, alludes to them as flattened, cylin-
Arical, nucleated cells. Finally, VeRsoxN, in opposition to HENLE, lays stress on the fact
that the cells in the fresh condition are always somewhat higher than broad. Accurate
measurements of the gland-vesicles and of the epithelial cells are given by the different
authors, into a consideration of which it is needless to enter here. The cavity of the vesicle is described as occupied by a clear yiscid fluid (Korner
and Frey) slightly tinged with yellow, and containing much albumin (Ko11axes).
