SZ This opposite tendency between nearly allied plants (further illustrated by the
S occasional impossibility of grafting, or of mutually fertilising, allied species), is a most,
SD interesling phenomenon, and of great importance from both a scientific and a practical
S point of view. Several illustrations of it will appear further on ; meanwhile we may,
b= in passing, allude to the necessity for caution in the interpretation of isolated experi-
=] ments which this fact demonstrates. Because 9 particular grass, or other plant, is
2 little benefited by ammonia-salts, for instance, it does not follow that it will not be
S favoured by nitrates ; nor, because if while growing in association with other Species it
= may not be specially benefited by a particular manure, does it follow that it would not
2 derive advantage from the same substance when growing separately,
£ The alleged antagonism of certain plants has been supposed to be dne to the
X injurious effects of root-excretions ;* but this supposition is, to 8ay the least, not
S a sufficient explanation of the observed phenomena. The true explanation of the facts
E recorded lies probably in the varying conformation and requirements of different
= plants, as will be illustrated in snbsequent sections. The adyantages derived from
© the practice of rotation also receive illustration from these same cireumstances,

5 Tabit and Conformation of Plants : Organisation by means of which they maintain
{a} or improve their position, or suecumb in competition with others.

Before passing to the consideration of individual species, a few general remarks.on
the structure and mode of life of the plants with which we have to deal are requisite.
All the plants are, indeed, well known, and many of the facts we have to call
