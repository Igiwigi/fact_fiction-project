Although ctenophores lack a complete responding to HH far from the source of the ligand
Delta ligand [11], abundant research from bilaterians supports respond differently from those near the source. The HH

nophores is unknown, but the fact that ctenophores seem to nalling components (ligand, dispatched transmembrane
