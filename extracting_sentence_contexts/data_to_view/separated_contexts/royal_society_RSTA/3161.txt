In the remainder of this section we will verify the remaining hypotheses of
theorem 3.14 in [9]. Hypothesis 1. The reaction terms in (5.1)-(5.3) are on
In fact they are C, so Hypothesis 1 is satisfied. Hypothesis 2. The system (5.1)-(5.3) has a travelling wave solution U*(é), € =x — ct, with left
state at the origin and right state U*, for which there exist numbers K > 0 and w_ <0 <4 such
that for € < 0, ||U*(é)|| < Ke~®-§, and for € > 0, | U*(€) — Ut || < Ke“.
