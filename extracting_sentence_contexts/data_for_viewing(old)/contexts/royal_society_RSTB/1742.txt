vident ; two, however, can be distinguished and they are about one inch (2°5
centims.) apart.
_ From the course of the vascular bundles we know that the total length of the
‘stem must have included many internodes, for, if our interpretation of the facts be
correct, it follows that each transverse section of the stem usually shows the traces
2 of the next ten leaves above. We must, therefore, picture Lyginodendron to
ourselves as having a tall, upright stem rising to a height of several feet and bearing
somewhat remote, spirally arranged, highly compound, fern-like leaves. The base of
> the stem, where the adventitious roots were given off, must have been buried for
» some depth in the earth or mud. Probably the bases of stems would be the parts
most often preserved, which would explain the frequency with which adventitious
4 roots are met with in connection with the stem. It is not probable that the roots
2 Were atrial; the fact that they branched freely immediately on leaving the stem
» militates against such an idea (see photograph 10, fig. 18). The velamen-like
3 outer layer, which might suggest an aérial root, is common to the finest rootlets,
2 and these must almost certainly have been subterranean, The well-developed xylem
> of the roots renders it probable that they vegetated in a fairly firm soil.
The stem is mechanically well-constructed and thus fitted to maintaiu an upright
2 position while bearing abundant foliage. We have no distinct evidence for any
thizome-like organs, but it is possible that some of the small shoots which are rather
2 deficient in sclerenchyma may have been creeping or subterranean. The small
3 specimens, which constitute almost the whole of our material, could not have been
$ branches borne on main stems, for in that case they would not have borne adventitious
: roots. If the plant really attained a relatively large size, then we must assume that
| our material is made up of young specimens.
