mostly or entirely dorsal to this. Among its fibres is a definite nucleus. The tract
reaches the caudal border of the diencephalon where it bends ventrally in a wide arc
before running anteriorly into the subthalamus. Most of its fibres are dissipated
in the subthalamus and some reach the subthalamic body itself. The apex
of the arc, fig. 16, incompletely separates the ventral nucleus of the lateral
geniculate body from the rest of the subthalamus. Here many optic fibres pass
through the tract and increase its apparent bulk considerably. The tractus strio-
subthalamicus appears to be an especially differentiated part of the stria terminalis
most of whose course it closely follows. Like the stria it has its own nuclear
development.

The subthalamus in Echidna differs little from that of other mammals although
the tractus strio-subthalamicus might be considered a peculiarity. The fact that
the ventral nuclei of the medial and lateral geniculate bodies are extensions of the
subthalamus is in accordance with their phylogenetic history. Kapprrs (1921) and
Le Gros Crark (1932, a) have shown that the ventral nucleus of the lateral geniculate
body has evolved from the subthalamus, and the latter author (1933) has shown
that the ventral nucleus of the medial geniculate body has a similar origin. Already
in Echidna this process has been initiated for both nuclei.

The cerebral peduncles are peculiar in that they contain no representative of the
fronto-pontine fibres of other mammals and that the pyramidal tracts lie exposed
at their medial border. It has been emphazised that the substantia nigra is confined
to the medial border of the peduncle in close association with the pyramidâ€”a fact
which accords with its supposed motor function. In the figures which Hines shows
