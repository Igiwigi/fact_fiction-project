Hence we are able to predict that the general expression for our - in the case before
us will be
Ck th) Ott ) Ct thy th,)
T<FS{LK,kkk)X5 + +k+k,) (ko kt ft foto tho et fo ks) | —A(k, kk, +k, kk, +k, kg ky, +k, koh)
For in the first place, the fact that the 7 vanishes when more than three relations
of equality exist between the K's, proves that we may assume 7, of the form
S{C(k, kk, k,)X6{k, kk ky; ky, ky},
the semicolon (;) separating the Fs into two groups, in respect of each of which
severally @ is a symmetrical form. But if in the expression last aboye written for 7,
we make kh, =kke=hk,* kr=kss
it becomes

a

(B+ +R)—(3+16+) kk hit) F8(k, k, k, k,) +, +k+k,)k, ki+k, k;+k, k+k, k;+k, k;+ks k;) 4
—A(k, ky k;+k, ky k;+k, k, k;+k, k, k;)
