Contrary to expectation, the lines obtained
from a single crystal of natural ice (grown on the surface of water in a basin, during cold
weather) were extremely fine and sharp when they could be seen at all, and it was often
found that no pattern, or only the faintest pattern, appeared even when the ice crystal used
was of suitable thickness and gave a good Laue photograph. This seems to indicate a high
degree of perfection in natural ice crystals even near to 0° CG, an indication which is confirmed . by the fact that reflexions from as many as seven planes did show secondary extinction in

some, presumably more mosaic, specimens, and by the further observation that, on the
whole, the single ice crystals were rather weak reflectors when the usual parallel-beam methods
were used. It will be noticed that the lines in divergent-beam photographs of ice and also in those of
less symmetrical organic compounds, are much less curved than many of those in diamond
photographs (cf. plate 16, figures 20 c, d and plate 17, figure 23 b,c). This is because diamond
