the other members of which the same phenomenon does not take place, as the Cheiromys
among the Lemurs, Trichecus among the Seals, and the recent Elephants (as regards the
premolars) among the Proboscideans. They form no parallel to the cases mentioned
above of the rudimentary formation of an entire series of teeth of the temporary or
milk-set,

To return to the Marsupials :—Tf this view be correct, T should be quite prepared to
find, in phases of development earlier than those yet examined, some traces either of
the papillary, follicular, or saccular stages of milk-predecessors to other of the teeth
besides those determinate four in which, for some unexplained reason, they arrive at &
more mature growth+. Such proof as this would alone decide the truth of these specu-
lations; and I have not at present either the requisite leisure or materials for following
out 80 delicate an investigation. I trust that the facts already elicited are sufficiently
novel and important to justify my bringing them, as they now stand, before the Society.

+ It may be remarked that the milk-tooth which alone is developed in the Marsupials corresponds homolo-
gically with that which, as a general rule, is most persistent in the typical diphyodonts, including Man, viz. the
posterior milk-molar, replaced by the posterior permanent premolar.
