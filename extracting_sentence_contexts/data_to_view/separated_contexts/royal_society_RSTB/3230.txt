We may now compare briefly Sigillaria scutellata with the other Sigillarias,
showing structure, which have previously been described. The Clathrarian type, S. Menardi, originally described by Bronenrarr under the
name S. elegans, differs from our stem in the absence of ribs, and in the fact that the
leaf-bases are approximate, and more or less fused together. Internally, an important
distinetion is found in the fact that the primary wood does not form a continuous ring
with a crenulated outer margin, but is aggregated into a large number of distinct
strands, quite free laterally from one another. These, with the secondary wood, con-
stitute definite vascular bundles. The leaf-traces have also secondary wood, as
Renautrt has shown.
