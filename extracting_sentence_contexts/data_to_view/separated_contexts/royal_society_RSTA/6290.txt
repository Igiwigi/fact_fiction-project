It would be quite proper to say that by a given symbol you mean so-and-so, even
though you have no intentions to use these symbols in any sort of communication [76]. The above position, that meaning is in large part a product of internal (to the mind) computation
is not fringe. In fact, it is arguably the dominant view among modern linguists and cognitive
scientists. That is not to say modern linguists and cognitive scientists deny that spoken and
written language is communicative; it obviously is. Rather, the point is that cognition (including
thinking, planning, etc) is often best modelled in terms of manipulations of meaningful symbols,
and these symbols have meaning whether or not they are attached to communication.
