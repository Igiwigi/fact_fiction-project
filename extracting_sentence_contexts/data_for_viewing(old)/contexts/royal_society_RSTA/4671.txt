2. Bayesian system identification

The problem of SI is easily stated: given measured data from a structure or system, how does one
infer the equations of motion which ‘generated’ the data. This problem is not at all easy to solve;
it is essentially an inverse problem of the second kind and can be extremely ill-posed even if the
underlying equations are assumed to be linear in the parameters of interest [3]. Furthermore, the
‘solution’ may not even be unique. If the equations of motion are not linear in the parameters of
interest, the difficulties multiply. Another issue is concerned with confidence in derived parameter
estimates. This issue is a result of the fact that measurements or data from a system will, in reality,
almost always be contaminated by random noise. Given a set of data D = {(xj,y;),i=1,...,N}
of sampled system inputs x; and outputs y;, if there is no measurement noise, an identification
algorithm should yield a deterministic estimate of the system parameters 0,

0 =id(D), (2.1)

where the function id represents the application of the identification algorithm to the data D.
Now, if noise e(f) is present on the input or output data (or both), 6 will become a random vector
conditioned on the data. In this context, one no longer wishes to find an estimate of 0, but rather
to specify one’s belief in its value. If it is assumed that the noise is Gaussian with (unknown)
standard deviation o,, then the parameter o, can be subsumed into 0, and inferred along with the
model parameters. In probabilistic terms, instead of equation (2.1) one now has
