Assuming 0 < w < wp,
i.e. horizontal links in the medium remain intact, for B > 6o, based on the analysis of figure 6 in
ยง5d, it can be conjectured that the crack propagates with a more complex bridge fracture regime
which we term the macro-cell bridge crack regime (figure 8). This fracture regime involves a
bridge crack whose structure and periodicity change with increase of the initial stored potential
energy in the system. This results from the fact that the increase in this energy allows more odd-
numbered vertical nodes behind the crack to surpass the threshold for failure. The accumulation
of this process, owing to the increase in stored initial energy, would allow transition to the regime
where a semi-infinite open crack can propagate in the structure at a second critical value of 6 that we
denote by fh; (figure 8). In a similar way, one can also consider regimes where 0 < f < fy and w > wo.
