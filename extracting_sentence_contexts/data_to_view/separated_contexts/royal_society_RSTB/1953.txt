On testing mammalian muscle by the method we have described we find that it
only gives two contractions, the first commencing at 44° C, and the second at 58° C. Mammalian muscle therefore differs from frog’s muscle in not giving a contraction
at 34° C. This exactly coincides with the fact that fresh extracts of mammalian
muscle contain no soluble myogen-fibrin, The two contractions which are obtained
correspond in their temperatures to the coagulations of the two proteids obtainable
from mammalian muscle. This is shown in fig. 4. The Meaning of the Variability in the Occurrence and in the Amount of the
Contractions Obtained at Temperatures above 40° C.
