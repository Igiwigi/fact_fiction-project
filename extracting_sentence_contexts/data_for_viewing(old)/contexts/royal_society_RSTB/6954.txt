That there is true continuity of the axoplasm past these septa is shown not only by the
absence of any complete separating membrane, but also by the absence of any staining
difference on the axon or any other of the appearances of synaptic separation such as are
seen at the contacts in the lateral giant fibre chain. These septa are found only rarely in
the abdominal ganglia.

Discussion

An interesting comparison can be made between the giant-fibre system of the prawn
and that of the earthworm. In the latter animal three giant axons, provided with myelin
sheaths, pass along the ventral nerve cord. They are not, however, continuous; for in each
segment the axoplasm is traversed by a septum, so that the giant fibres are in fact made up
of a chain of segmental axons like the lateral fibre system in the crustacean. The axoplasm
of each segmental fibre is completely separated by the septum from that of the next fibre
in the chain. Each fibre of the chain has been shown to be a syncitium, for they are made
up by the fusion of the processes of several nerve cells in the corresponding ganglion. The
syncitial nature of the earthworm axons has been proved by tracing the axons which
compose them back to their cell bodies, and by degeneration experiments in which it
was shown that the giant fibres do not degenerate on either side of any cut made in them
(see Stough 1926).

The results of the degeneration experiments here described are not a conclusive proof
that the prawn median and lateral axons also are syncitial in structure, but they are
reinforced by the observation of apparent fusions between the large axons and small
