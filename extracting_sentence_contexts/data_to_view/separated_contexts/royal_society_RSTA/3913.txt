Viroids have mutation rates in the range 10-3 <n <107
just below the equilibrium limit, as if non-equilibrium constraints could remain minimal for
the replication of such genomes. RNA viruses are in the range 10-°<1< 10-4, which is
consistent with the aforementioned values of the error probability for exonuclease-deficient
DNA polymerases. The mutation rates drop to 10-? <n <10~® for DNA viruses in agreement
with the fact that their DNA polymerases have acquired exonuclease proofreading. For bacteria
and eukaryotes, the mutation rates are in the range 10-™ < n < 10~°, which is possible thanks
to further proofreading with DNA mismatch repair [33-35]. In this regard, the general trends
of mutation rates during evolution can be understood on the basis of biochemical kinetics.
