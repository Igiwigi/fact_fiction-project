Our present subject is the excitatory process in the mammalian ventricle, and
the past publications to which we shall at present refer are those of WALLER and
Rept, Bayuiss and SraruineG,} and lastly Gorcu.ยง

Believing, as we do, that the spread of the excitatory process in the mammalian
ventricle is far more complex than any of these writers had reason to suspect, and
of so special a kind as to render the methods which they adopted almost abortive,
we do not feel justified in discussing these papers in any detail. With a single
exception the experiments named date back many years, and antedate recent and
remarkably progressive developments of cardiac physiology.

Tt is necessary to emphasise the fact that recent discoveries have increased our
knowledge to such extent and so altered our conception of processes in the ventricle,
as to place the whole question upon a different footing and to make it abundantly
clear that the older methods of investigation were incapable of analysing the progress
of the natural excitation wave. In this connection they become almost purely
historical. : ;

The observations of WALLER and Rem, and the later observations of WALLER,||
were undertaken upon the dying heart, either excised or beating in situ after decapi-
tation of the animal. Such records as were obtained were from the heart muscle
deprived of its circulation. Upon this score alone we should be compelled to rule
out the conclusions of these experiments while discussing the cause of the natural
excitation wave.
