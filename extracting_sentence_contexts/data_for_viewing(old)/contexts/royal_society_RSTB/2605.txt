SYSTEMATIC STUDY OF THE MADREPORARIAN TYPES OF CORALS. 183

passing outwards from the axis of the trabeculz in Cyclolites and allied genera. He
thought they possibly corresponded to the small surface granulations which he called
nodules (‘Knétchen”)—a few small granulations uniting to form the “pseudo-
synapticula.” Prarz, however, made no farther research in this direction, and,
therefore, failed to recognize the full significance of the successive “nodular” groups
as the individual growth-parts of the trabecule representing successive growth-periods
of the polyp (antea, p. 156).

When that general fact is recognized we can follow the trabecular growth-part in
its various forms, narrow and bilaterally symmetrical, large and radially symmetrical,
throughout every great group of the Madreporaria. In Siderastrea the average
measurements of a trabecular growth-part are as follows :—

Classificatory Relationship of Siderastrea.

The microscopic structure of a single trabecula is, as we have seen, identical in the
genus Siderastrea, and in genera belonging to the sub-family Pseudoastreine, PRrarz.
