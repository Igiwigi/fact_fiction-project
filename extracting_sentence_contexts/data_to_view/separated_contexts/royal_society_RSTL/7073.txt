Once a week a sample was taken
from the bottom, by sending a reversed bottle down to the bottom, turning it there,
and after having allowed it to stand some time, taking it slowly up. The mean of
nineteen observations was 19-002 per 1000 salt, which, according to the manner in which
the samples were taken, is rather under than above the real mean, and proves clearly
that it is water from the Kattegat which runs at the bottom of the Sound. But we
have also direct obseryations of the same fact. Some years ago a steamer was, close to
Elsinore, struck by another steamer, and sunk a very short time after the. collision.
