lower oceanic crust that is characterized by large alternations in melt fraction over lengthscales
of metres, by open sills with thin mushy margins embedded in hot, but subsolidus, cumulates
(figure 3a). This model hangs upon the generation of primitive cumulate rocks with very small
trapped melt fractions: a crucial question for future study is to understand the process by which
porosity is occluded in lower-crustal mushes.

6. Concurrent mixing and cooling: a constraint on sill thickness?

In the previous section, it was argued that the distribution of melt in the oceanic lower crust may
be dominated by the presence of liquid sills encased in hot cumulate rock. The next question to


address is that of the characteristic thickness of such sills. The fact that individual melt bodies
are difficult to image with geophysical approaches places an upper bound on their size on the
scale of 100s of metres. Petrological and geological observations from ophiolites indicate that
the melt layer thickness may be substantially smaller, perhaps as little as a metre. The vertical
evolution of mineral compositions on the sub-metre scale in near-Moho cumulate gabbros from
both Troodos [60] and Oman [26] have been used to support this finding. It is likely that these
metre-scale estimates are minima because near-Moho bodies in ophiolites may have undergone
some flattening after formation of the layering [26]. Nevertheless, the ratio of preserved cumulate
layer thickness to original liquid thickness is likely to be preserved and [26] estimated that 5-20%
crystallization took place in near-Moho melt lenses. This corresponds to a temperature drop of
<20Â°C for crystallization of basalt to generate cumulate gabbro.

Observational tests of these models of metre-scale melt-rich sills have been challenging to
