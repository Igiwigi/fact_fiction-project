E. Graxr, it is highly probable this eleventh, or terminal ganglion, con-
sisted originally of two separate ganglia, with short intervening cords. Â© This is
the more probable as there are no ganglia, or cords, in the twelfth and anal
segments, the parts being supplied with nerves directly from the terminal
ganglion. This opinion is also supported by the fact, that in the larya of
several other moths, particularly that of the Phalena (Bombyz) neustria, LINN.,

there are two very distinct ganglia, with intervening cords, which afterwards
unite to form the terminal ganglion of the perfect insect. In describing the nerves distributed from these ganglia, it may be well to
consider them as belonging to the head, the thorax and abdomen. In the first
there are the cerebral lobes and first ganglion, which are found in the head in
every period of the insect's existence, but undergo a modification of form,
are increased in diameter, and furnish nerves to the organs of sense and man-
ducation.
