oysters should, by common consent, be admitted neither to
be good nor wholesome, under the same circumstances ; for
no general law against dredging for them would prevent
those possessed of private beds from indulging their appetites
during the months of May, June, and July, if they found that
oysters were better in those months.

I had an opportunity last July of setting this question at
rest; for being at Dieppe, in France, where there is no
restriction laid upon oysters, I ordered some for dinner : they
had no flavour, none of the company could eat them. I found
it equally true in Paris ; but the fact is, the period respecting
the oyster, which corresponds to the breeding season of fishes,
is March and April, when the ova are getting ready for im-
pregnation. In June and July the ova have been impregnated,
and may be said to have spawned at the time the embryo is
first received into the oviduct; which is in the month of June.
At the time the young oysters leave the oviduct, there is a
mucus of a purple colour which is voided at the same time,
probably for the purpose of supplying them with nourishment
while they remain enclosed within the enveloping mantle by
which the gills are surrounded.

While in this situation they often become a prey to small
