sorus. ;

If we for the moment accept Pranti’s definition of the receptacle as a body
containing tracheides, his statement that it is absent in his Osmundales breaks down
at once. It is true that in many genera (e.g., Danewa, Angiopteris, Aneimiu, Mohria,
Todea) no extension of vascular tissue below the insertion of the sporangia is seen ;
but in others a considerable extension is found; I have shown this in Kaulfussia

ai Studies,” III., Plate 8, fig. 42); and similar developments, though smaller, are found
sin Marattia Kaulfussii, wel Sraxinea. In Gleichenia dichotoma also, quite a con-
siderable mass of tracheides extends into the projecting receptacle, so that if it be cut
Zin transverse section, the whole receptacle appears circular in outline, with a central
Acireular mass of tracheides. These facts prevent my accepting the position of PRANTL
Sin recognising the receptacle (in his peculiar sense) as a peculiarity of his Pteridales.
On other grounds, his division of the Ferns into Osmundales and Pteridales itself does
not seem to me to be an expression of a natural difference ; this opinion is greatly
sstrengthened by the breakdown of one of his chief distinguishing characters.
‘4 To me the “ receptacle” is merely the basis upon which the sporangia are inserted ;
‘Sin order to meet certain mechanical and physiological requirements it is liable to
Scertain elaborations of form and structure, which may result in its becoming in extreme
‘2 cases large and prominent. But I cannot find any reason for seeing in it any more
% recondite morphological meaning; it need not be regarded as a modification of any
e other part of the plant, such as a pinnule, or the termination of a nerve. That a sorus

Eout into it, is common, and physiologically very practical; but against these cases
