In this case, then, the doubly-infinite family of periodic solutions which exists when » = 0
leads when p. 4 0 to a finite number of singly-infinite families of periodic solutions. We may note how this conclusion fits in with a remark made at the end of §7 (i)
(p. 170 above). We there saw that in special cases there may branch from Family I
at the generating solution a doubly-infinite family of periodic solutions instead of a
finite number of singly-infinite families: the cases in question are, of course, those in
which the system (5.1) is “soluble.” There is, then, an obvious connection between
the statement just italicised and the fact that in § 7 the general case is that in which
there branch from the generating solution two singly-infinite families of periodic solutions
and not a doubly-infinite family. We may sum up by saying that for an arbitrary
Hamiltonian system the periodic solutions are in general “ singular.”

It is easily shown that the theorems italicised on p. 212 above are true of a periodic
solution of zero characteristic ratio which belongs to a singly- but not a doubly-infinite
family of periodic solutions. SUMMARY AND SYNTHESIS.
