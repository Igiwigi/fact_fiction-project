I am inclined to refer much of this precession of the warm region at Toronto
to the geographical distribution of land and water there. The Atlantic is on the
east and the continent of America on the west of the station, and as Dove's charts
and results intimate, the temperature may rise higher and sooner over the land than
over the water, and 80 throw the warm region in respect of Toronto in advance of the
time or of the 8un. In the case of Hobarton the arrangement is different ; and, in fact,
what land there is is between the advancing sun and the station, and would tend to
hold the warm air region back, and tend to cause its time to coincide with that of
the sun. Even the greater difference in summer than in winter at Toronto appears
to be explicable in the same manner, by reference to the relative position of the sun
at the two seasons to the land and water arrangement.

3033. Though the temperature on the earth's surface is a very uncertain indication
of that above (2937.), yet as far as it goes it harmonizes with this view.
