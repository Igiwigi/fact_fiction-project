& accelerated by the stimulation of the nerve, in others no alteration of rhythm can be
= perceived. Thus in Plate 67, fig. 6, B, as s00n as beats appear after the primary
S quiescence they.show a light acceleration of rhythm; s0, too, in such figures as Plate 68,
â€” figs. 9, 10, where the nerve stimulation produced a primary diminution and a primary
V augmentation of the force of the contractions respectively, the rhythm is seen to be
= accelerated or unaltered from the commencement of the stimulation.

Z In all cases where acceleration occurs, the return to the original rate is slow and
AQ gradual, in the same way as the return to the original contraction force.

Another proof that this quiescence, which is caused by stimulation of the vagus, is
not due to any interference with the rate of discharge from the motor ganglia, is most
markedly shown by the fact that stimulation of the nerve often reduces the ventricle
toa state of complete quiescence, while the auricles not only continue beating but beat
with greater rapidity than before. Thus we may have complete quiescence of the ven-
tricle with the auricles s0 nearly quiescent that their accelerated contractions are barely
visible on the curve (Plate 67, fig. 7), in other cases with the anricular contractions
more and more plainly visible (Plate 67, fig. 5), until finally we may obtain curves in
which the ventricular beats are diminighed down to complete quiescence, while the
