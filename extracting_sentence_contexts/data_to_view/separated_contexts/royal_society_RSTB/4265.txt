In forming Marsupial enamel there is no trace of the
existence of such prolongations of the cytoplasm of the ameloblasts as those on which
Tomes has based his theory of enamel development. Fig. 27 of this paper evidently corresponds to such sections as those of which Tomes
(11, p. 113) has given the following deseription :—

“Tt will be noticed that in these oblique sections, the partitions of the honeycomb

are well stained, as they usually are; but as we progress further into the more formed
enamel, the corresponding areas become light, and it is the contained fibre alone that
is stained. In fact the septa have almost disappeared under the action of the
decaleifying acid, and still further, in yet more developed enamel, they quite disappear,
leaving the fibres free.”

Also, “In the openings of the honeycomb dark bodies, the fibres cut across occur in
many places, whilst in others they have fallen out ; but enough remains to show their
identity with the row of dark oval bodies which, with light interspaces, constitute the
older more solid portion.”
© Evidently the areas seen in fig. 27 (e.7.) are identical with those which Tomes
‘\ deseribes as fibres, and which, in his opinion, are prolongations of the ameloblastic
*g cytoplasm usually termed Tomes’ processes. :

2 As stated earlier in this paper, I believe we have the strongest evidence that Tomes’
ZA processes are not cytoplasmic, but are purely metaplasmic. This view is corroborated
S by the study of sections such-as the one we have under consideration. Moreover, there is no evidence of the enamel cells secreting any product except
52 the ameloblastic secretion, nor is there any evidence of the pouring out of a
«> substance about the prisms, a view which both Tomxs and Mummery hold, though
‘2 neither of these authors gives any indication of its origin.
