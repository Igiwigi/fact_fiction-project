Now Sir WriLL.am TromsoN's 8olution shows that the surface radial displacement
(which is of course equal to o) is equal to

Hwa? Tr (8 cos vt—g7) bv (Aoknls avst pet

o,: 8
—===——e08 8,
4 r+q

This expression gives the equilibrium elastic tide, the snffix being added to the
o to indicate that it is only a firs approximation. Before going further we may remark that

Tf therefore we put (with Sir WrLiTam THoms0N) r=, we have

8 cos vi—g7=;—8 cos of toe [5 a SD}

When we wish to proceed to a second approximation, including the effects of
inertia, it must be noticed thab the equations of motion in the two problems only
differ in the fact that in that relating to viscosity the terms introduced by inertia are

ne1 ag dry O * 5 Pa PB *y
lo WES, whilst in the case of elasticity they are —Wp — Wag — O55

Hence a very slight alteration will make the whole of the above investigation
applicable to the case of elasticity ; we have, in fact, merely to differentiate the
approximate values for «, Þ, y twice with regard to the time instead of once. Then just as before, we find the surface radial displacement, as far as it is due to

inertia, to be (compare (55))
was 79 Y

cos vt,

and, cos vt must; be pub equal to (the firs: approximation) S cos of —g". Hence by

(57) and (83) the surface radial displacement due to inertia is —— IT Scos vt.
