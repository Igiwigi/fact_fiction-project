The importance of cellular forces to morphogenesis, wound healing and disease
is now widely recognized [1-5]. Experimental studies have shown that irregu-
larities in these forces can give rise to developmental defects and other
malformations [6], and computational models have shown that alterations as
small as 20% can affect clinical outcomes [7].

In many settings, these driving forces can be treated as equivalent interfacial
tensions y; along cell-cell and cell-medium boundaries [8,9] (electronic sup-
plementary material, figure S1), a concept considered as early as the 1960s
[10,11] but quickly dropped in favour of the differential adhesion hypothesis
[12]. Computer simulations of sorting and other cell movements carried out
by the authors, however, showed that a wide range of cell and tissue move-
ments were in fact driven largely by interfacial tensions [13-15] (to which
cell-cell adhesions make a counteracting contribution [8]), leading to a new
paradigm [2,16—20]. Information about these tensions can be obtained through
a variety of experimental techniques, that in generally decreasing length scale
include: pipette aspiration, deformable substrates, engineered droplets, laser
ablation, atomic force microscopy, optical tweezers, magnetic cytometry, and
fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) microscopy [18,21—31]. Unfortu-
