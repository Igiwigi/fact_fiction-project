other plants. From present knowledge it is evident that these two bodies and
their attached threads represent the particular pair of chromosomes which produces
the nucleolus in telophase at a particular locus of their length. At these and later
stages the nucleolus frequently retains a more deeply staining outer rim or shell,
figs. 10-13, Plate 22.

Fig. 12, Plate 22, represents a further stage in the shortening and thickening of
the chromatic threads in the nucleus. They now assume a superficially beaded
appearance, and the larger chromatic aggregations previously present, fig. 11,
have disappeared. A small protein crystalloid is sometimes present in the nucleolus,
as in fig. 12. Neither now nor at earlier stages can free ends of threads be seen in
uncut nuclei. For reasons which will appear later, the beaded character of the
leptotene thread at this time is believed to be due to the fact that it is composed
of two threads twisted about each other and so forming nodes and internodes.
The threads are presumably double also in the earlier stages represented by figs. 10
and 11, but they may be too near the limits of resolution to show any indications of
this. There is no indication as to what happens to the numerous granules which
disappear between figs. 11 and 12.

Figs. 13-19, Plate 22, represent more or less successive stages of synizesis. In these
stages free ends are never observed in uncut nuclei. It therefore appears probable
that all the chromosomes are already arranged end-to-end at this time. Frequently
a single nucleolar body, formed by the fusion of two, is visible in the nucleolus,
figs. 13-15, 18, 19, and in some cases the thread passing through this body can be
clearly traced over the surface of the nucleolus, figs. 14, 18, 19. The same conditions
