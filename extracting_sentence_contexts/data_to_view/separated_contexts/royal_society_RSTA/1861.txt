Darwin and Mendeleev revolutionized their respective disciplines by embodying complex
phenomena in simple, symbolic form—Darwin’s tree of life (1859) and Mendeleev’s periodic table
of the elements (1869). The simplicity of the symbols created scaffolds for ordering masses of facts
and observations into entities that provided a unifying explanation for the nature of the elements
and the diversity of life. At the same time, they defined future paths of inquiry. Here I will explore
what they have in common and the meaning of ‘theory’, but I first consider something that has
always distinguished the two.
