restricted classes of control laws, e.g. linear control [72,73], sample-data control [73], simple
adaptive control [74], sliding mode control [75,76], etc. A lot of attention was devoted to controlled
synchronization of fractional-order systems [75,77,78].

6. Cybernetics and thermodynamics

Thermodynamics is a field of physics where methods of cybernetics (information theory and

control theory) have been actively applied for several decades. Even its classical results can be : =
interpreted in the ‘cybernetic spirit’ using the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) principle: a system : S
evolves to a state with maximum value of entropy compatible with all constraints imposed 73
by other physical laws [79,80]. In fact, connection between Second Law of Thermodynamics, : &
information and control was hidden still in the ‘Maxwell’s Demon’ introduced by Maxwell as 22
early as in 1867. Unveiling this connection, this Demon's puzzle is still continuing even in a century : 4
and a half after the Demon’s birth. The modern understanding of this connection starts with the : iS
seminal result of Rolf Landauer, who proposed in 1961 a fundamental link between information : Ss
and energy (Landauer’s principle) [81] (see [86, p. 190601-1]): [8

Erasing information in a macroscopic or mesoscopic system is an irreversible process that
should require a minimum amount of work, kT In 2 per bit erased, where T is the system
temperature and k is Boltzmann’s constant.

Apparently, Landauer’s principle looks like one more law of cybernetical physics. Later
Bennett [82] and, independently Penrose [83] related Landauer’s principle to the paradox
