We may now be in a position to throw some light on the apparent Sand S, anomalies:
(a) ‘up to about 20° the S-residuals are spread over about 20sec without any convincing
concentration of frequency’ (Jeffreys 1946, p. 61), (4) seismograms of near earthquakes
sometimes show S, as having arrived | to 2sec before the time at which it would be expected
after P, (Jeffreys 1929, p. 98).

A difficulty now arises in the fact that having chosen to represent the generating dis-
turbance by an instantaneous shock, we have derived infinite displacements at the time of
arrival of certain of the minimum-time path pulses. We may overcome this failure to comply
with physical conditions by slightly modifying the initial pulse to one of the form
