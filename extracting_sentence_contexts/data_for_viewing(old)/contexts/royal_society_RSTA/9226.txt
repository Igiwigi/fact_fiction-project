Srarkt has found that when a luminous source is placed in a powerful electric
field the radiations are resolved into components in a manner analogous to the Zeeman
effect in a magnetic field. The separation of the components in an electric field
appears to be related in some way to the atomic weight of the element, the greatest
effect being observed in the case of the Balmer series of hydrogen, and the diffuse
series of helium. The separation is of another order of magnitude to the corresponding
magnetic separation. Thus at ’ = 4000 ALU. the separation of the outer components
of a normal Zeeman triplet in a field of 30,000 Gauss is about 0°5 A.U., whilst for the
hydrogen line H, in an electric field of 30,000 volts x em.~', the outermost components
are separated by 13°0 A.U. Sark considers that the broadening of spectrum lines
at high pressures and under powerful conditions of electrical excitation is intimately
connected with the electrical resolution of the lines, being in fact due to the electric
effect of neighbouring atoms on the luminous particle. The phenomena appear to be
strictly analogous. Srark also points out that the electrical separation of the
components increases with the term number in a series, just as the broadening also
increases. The electrical separation is greatest for lines of diffuse series, which
also undergo the greatest broadening. Further, lines in the spectra of helium and
lithium which are unsymmetrically broadened are also unsymmetrically resolved in the
electric field.{ :

It is evident that in order to obtain further evidence it is necessary to determine
experimentally the distribution of intensity in the broadened spectrum lines, since we
may predict (on this view) from the separation and intensity of the components in an
electric field, the distribution of intensity to be expected in the broadened spectrum
