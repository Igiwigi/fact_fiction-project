11. Molgula heydemanni, M1cHAELsEN, 1915.

Habitat and Distribution.—Recorded in dredgings off the west coast of Africa. The
species is attached by the ventral side, and has its surface encrusted with sand, etc.

Dimensions.—Maximum size but 7 mm., and sexually mature apparently at 2 or
3 mm. diameter.

Remarks.—According to MicHAx.sEn, this species is the smallest solitary ascidian.
It forms aggregates and reproduces viviparously.

Development.—MiIcHAELSEN states that numerous embryos and tailed larve were
found in the atrial cavity. The fact that the adults are said to occur in small aggre-
gates would seem to imply that the tadpoles escape in batches and in many cases,
at least, fall to the bottom without an active swimming stage.
