As regards the orientation of the sporangia in these genera, there seems to
be no regularity. In Osmunda sporangia in proximity to one another face in the
most various directions; and even in Zodea, where their arrangement has some
reference to the nerves of the leaf, the sporangia upon a single nerve show no common
rule of orientation. This is in accordance with a developmental drawing published
some years ago.*

The family has long been recognised as holding an intermediate position between
Eusporangiate and Leptosporangiate Ferns, as regards the size, structure, and mode
of origin of the sporangia. The observations on which this view has been based have
been made chiefly on Osmunda.t Though I have already published a preliminary
note on the development in Todea barbara,t as well as a brief description with
figures,ยง there are various facts of interest not there fully dealt with which will
justify a fresh description for this species.

A point which comes out very plainly from comparison of a number of sporangia
of Todea barbara is that there is a great variety of detail in the segmentation, size,
and form of sporangia on the same leaf, notwithstanding that they represent actually
similar stages of development. These differences start from the very first, as is seen
from fig. 32, in which two sporangia are shown already projecting as convex out-
growths, but the segmentation is not uniform: it is further to be noted that the cells
marked (x) do not compose the whole outgrowth, but that adjoining cells also con-
tribute in a certain degree, so that strictly speaking the whole sporangium is not
referable in origin to the single cell. The massive stalk is partly formed from sur-
rounding cells, just as in Gleichenia the extra segmentations contribute to the same
