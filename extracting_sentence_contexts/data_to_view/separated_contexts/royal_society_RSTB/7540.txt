But attention, at least, was paid to
all the circumstantial points mentioned above. Considered together, the observations
provide certain indications of an orderly system of flight directionâ€”wind direction relations
dependent on wind speed and height of flight. These results, together with the findings on
the effect of wind speed on flight activity and on the height of flight, make it worth while to
consider how the wind may in fact affect the behaviour of the locusts, first as a direct
mechanical stimulus to them and secondly as an indirect cause of visual stimulation. Reactions to direct stimulation by wind. It is sometimes assumed (e.g. by Zolotarevsky 1929)
that flying insects can sense the direction of the wind directly, by its pressure on their bodies,
even if the wind be completely smooth.
