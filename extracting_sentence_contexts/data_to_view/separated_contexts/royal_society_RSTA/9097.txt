We are compelled
to seek an explanation of the curve in terms of several components whose individual
curves are superposed, and are led directly to the Stark effect as the foundation of the
whole phenomenon. Several qualitative reasons have already been advanced in favour
of this hypothesis, and it now appears further that a quantitative study of the curves
necessitates the same hypothesis. For if several components are to be admitted, only
the Stark effect seems capable of providing them, and the fact that they must be
symmetrical in H, enhances this conclusion. ‘The components are conspicuous in H8
