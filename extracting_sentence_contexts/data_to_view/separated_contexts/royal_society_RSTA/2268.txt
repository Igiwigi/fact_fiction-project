The red node 1is orthogonal to all nodes connected by a red edge, and similarly for green
and yellow. (Online version in colour.)

The KS theorem is usually presented in two equivalent ways, which mirror the presentation
given above. The first is in terms of joint measurements of compatible dichotomic (yes/no)
observables, i.e. the projectors {Pj}; above, and the second in terms of single trichotomic
measurements, i.e. in the basis {|i), |j), |k)}, or, equivalently, a POVM with effects {|i)(i|, |j)(j|, |K)(KI}. This is due to the fact that the measurement in the basis {|i), |j), |k)} represents a joint measurement
of the three projectors P;, Pj, Pr, with Py = |a)a|, « =i,j,k. We may call the above perspectives,
respectively, the ‘observable perspective’ (OP) and the ‘effect perspective’ (EP). In EP, we
are interested in the value assignment to effects of a measurements, independently of which
measurement the same effect appears in, e.g. the assignment of {0,1} to the effect |i)(i|,
independently of which basis |i) belongs to.
