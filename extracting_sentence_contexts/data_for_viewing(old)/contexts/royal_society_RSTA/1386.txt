The fact that y, is not continuous at the boundary of the inner rectangle (—m1/2,1m/2) x
(—mz/2,m2/2) does not matter here since only its sign is important. Thus, the value of co <0
can be taken arbitrarily but is negative. In this work, we take cp = —|o|. The coordinates yp, and

Yp, are computed as

Yp, =F (2%, n) and yp, =F ( rn)

and the parameters f, = F(./1 — R,11) and fz = F(./1 — R, rz), where R = (1 — 11)(1 — r2)/(r1r2). The
function F(t,k) is the incomplete elliptic integral of first kind defined by
