elasticity, requires further elucidation. A number of other experiments have helped
in the analysis of the somewhat complex phenomena which are produced by loading
and unloading an iron wire while in the annealed state.

When the wire is annealed in the magnetising field, the amount of magneti
which it possesses when it has become cool is an uncertain quantity, and
much on the rapidity of the cooling, being greater for slow than for fast cooling.
goon as loading begins the magnetism rises rapidly, especially when it, has
(perhaps from the cooling having happened somewhat quickly) to have been initially
low. In fact, the annealed wire is, magnetically, in an extremely unstable state, al
responds with great sensitiveness to the first application of load, every step of which
(up to a certain limit) causes a rise of magnetism. This rise is nob lost on the with-
drawal of the stress ; the application and removal of load leaves the wire permanently
more magnetic. Indeed, the first application and remoyal of a small load produces
an angmentation of magnetism not unlike that which would be produced by tapping,
This continues during several successive loadings, and it is only when the load has
been applied and removed many times that the changes of magnetiszm become
sensi√æly cyclic.

the character of the effect of load when it becomes cyclic depends on the limit to
which loading has been carried. If the total load has been only 1 kilo. (corresponding
