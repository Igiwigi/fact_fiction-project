unlikely to be of practical interest on its own account.

We take the origin at the centre of the gap, the x-axis along the breakwater and the y-axis
in the direction of propagation of the incident waves. The problem now reduces to finding
a function F(x, y), satisfying equation (8) together with the boundary condition dF /dy = 0
or F = Oat y = 0, |x| >40, according as the breakwater is of the rigid or cushion type, and
containing a term e~” for y negative, corresponding to the incident waves.

Now if we suppose for the moment that the part of the breakwater to the left of the gap
(i.e. for x< — 4b) is removed, we have the case of a semi-infinite barrier for which the solution
is given by (14). It has been seen that this solution may be analyzed into two parts, one of
which corresponds to the shadow and reflexion as given by geometrical optics, and the other
corresponds to diffraction waves diverging from the end of the barrier. In fact, on making
use of (19) and (21) as in §4 we can write the expression (14) for F(x, y) in the forms

F(x,y) =e" —f, +g, for x< 4b and for all y, (36)
