17. 1t remains to find the electrokinetic part of the forcive tending to increase the
electric displacement (/, g, h) in an element 57 of free zether. The kinetic energy ass0-
ciated with the element is

T, = (fF + gG + AH) 87;

therefore


THE ELECTRIC AND.LUMINIFKROUS MEDIUM. 721

No difference is here introduced by motion of the wther such as represents magnetic
induction : in fact we have seen that the kinetic reaction on an electron ¢ moving
ong with the ether is—edF/dt simply ; and to a doublet moving in this way the
electric displacement in the element of sether itself may be assimilated. This forcive
P., Qs, Ry) strains the wther, and is compensated jointly by the stress which it thus
calls forth and the kinetic reaction of the motion involved in change of strain. 18.
