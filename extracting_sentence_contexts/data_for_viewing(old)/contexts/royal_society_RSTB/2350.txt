increase with every slight increase in the amount of carbon dioxide in the outer air.
We shall in fact show in a subsequent paper that there is within these limits a
remarkable quantitative correspondence between increased pressure of CO, and
increased assimilation.

The restriction in the absorption of the gas by the leaf must rather be sought in
the difficulty which the gaseous carbon dioxide experiences in passing from the

intercellular spaces through the cell-walls of the assimilating parenchyma, ‘The
penetration of these cell-membranes must necessarily be preceded by the solution of
the gas, and any phenomena of diffusion which take place between this point and
the assimilating centres must be referred to liquid and not to gaseous diffusion.

GrauHaM, in his Bakerian Lecture of 1850 (‘Chemical and Physical Researches,’
p. 446), showed that the “liquid diffusion of carbonic acid is a slow process compared
