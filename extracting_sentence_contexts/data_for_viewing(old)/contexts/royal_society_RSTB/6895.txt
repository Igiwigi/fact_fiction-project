measurements have, however, been made on one animal, Dendrocoelum lacteum, by
Gelei (1922). With a particularly favourable object and by means of what appears
to be most rare technical skill, Gelei succeeded in measuring every chromosome
(2n=14) in two complete nuclei. Unfortunately, the comparable measurements for
pachytene are not given and there is no knowledge of spiral structure in the pre-
meiotic chromosomes. Even this work is therefore not readily usable for comparative
purposes. If, however, it is assumed that “‘diplotan” is, as it appears to be, the
equivalent of the plant pachytene, the general impression gained from Gelei’s figures
is not unlike that of Osmunda.

Even were the evidence from Osmunda above reproach it would, however, still be
unsafe to attribute general significance to the conclusions as long as they refer to only
one organism. For this reason it has seemed profitable to publish the facts as they
stand in the hope that confirmation (or the reverse) may be obtainable by other
workers on other material. Should this be forthcoming it will perhaps be possible to
reply to the next question which has to be raised, namely, when exactly does the
prophase elongation cease? Is it really completed before pairing begins or is the
chromosome still lengthening during zygotene?

That such an apparently simple question should still be unanswered is symptomatic
of our ignorance regarding these much studied processes. Far larger problems remain.
Why, for instance, should a twisted shape be the unstressed state of the chromosome
thread? Why does the equilibrium suddenly become altered during prophases so that
untwisting occurs? What are the chemical influences necessary to produce the changes
of length which seem to precede and to follow chromosome pairing? What is the
