59. We may for the scrolls $(1, m, n) and $(1, 12?) verify the theorem that each
generating line meets the Nodal Total in a number of points=S—2. In fact for the scroll $(1, m, n), the directrix curves are respectively multiple curyes
of the orders mn, 7, m, and a generating line meets each of these in a single point,
counting for the three curves respectively as nn—1, 2—1, and m—1 points respectively. Moreover the construction (ante, Art. 43) for the Nodal Residue NR(1, m, n) shows that
a generating line meets this curve in (m—1)(n—1) points; and since the curye is
merely a double curye, these count each as a single point; and the generating line

does not; meet the Nodal Generator NG(1, m, 2). The number of intersections there-
