and then take the limit as , > 0+. Upon doing this we find that the integrals over the first and
last parts of g cancel leaving us with

1yo(0) = Vkb(ha — fn) = «Vg — In (2) =o, 6.19)

where V; is the volume of a fixed compact region in a f= constant slice of the universe. Thus we
see that if the exponential part of g were removed, so that ft = ty, then Iy(y(y) =0. When this is
done the universe we get is analogous to particles popping into and out of existence in quantum
field theory. These ‘bump’ universes in MV,(P4(1,2)) are the only ones which yield I¢q)(v) =0.
However, we see from equation (3.19) that it should be possible to find universes in MV, (P4(1,2))
in which the middle exponential branch exists and for which I) (¢) is as close to zero as we wish.
The fact that we can construct universes with I-q)(y)=0 seems a bit disconcerting. For
example, we can take an exponential solution g = wet, tj <t <tr and adjoin to it an exponential
‘bump’, given by
gy =aexp(Bt), th<t<ty
gi =a exp(Ait), Hh <t<ty
$2 = a2 exp(A2t), fy <b <ts
gy =aexp(Bt), fg St Sty,

where fj < ty <tz <f3 <tf, and y/(H) = 9} (t), 9} (t2) = 94(t2), 93 (ts) = ¢'(ts), with all w’s and f’s
chosen so that y, > 0 where it is continuous. It can be shown using an argument similar to the
one employed to compute [() for the g solution given in equation (3.12), that the value of the
