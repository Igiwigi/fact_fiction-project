Another obvious problem with the models of Henrich [4] and designed to test the population size hypothesis. Rather, they

Powell et al. [5] is that they assume an individual’s skill level is were created to demonstrate the feasibility of population size

there is now a consensus that, across a wide range of activities, The results of formal and simulation models are not data; they

differences between the performance of experts and individuals are aids to reasoning.
