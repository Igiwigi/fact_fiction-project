under increasing scrutiny. Modern optical technologies have enabled resolution
of ever-finer detail, so that we can visualize and track behaviour across scales
[1,2]. Consider for example the gallop of a horse: how are its four feet coordi-
nated? This fast action cannot be resolved by the human eye, so the question

pher Eadweard Muybridge successfully imaged the gait sequences of a horse
[3]. Control of rhythmic limb movements in both vertebrates and invertebrates
is determined by neuronal networks termed central pattern generators (CPG),
where motor feedback is not required [4]. Indeed, CPGs in in vitro preparations
can produce activity patterns that are identifiable with the in vivo behaviour.
For instance, in the pteropod Clione limacine (sea butterfly), which swims
with two dorsal wings, the neuronal pattern for basic synchronous movement
(fictive swimming) can be reproduced in isolated pedal ganglia [5]. A striking
example of the genetic basis of gait-control and CPGs pertains to the Icelandic
horse, where the ability to pace (legs on the same side of the body moving
synchronously) was shown to be associated with a point mutation [6].

At the microscale, organisms interact with their world following very differ-
ent physical principles. Here, inertia is negligible and many species developed
motile appendages that are slender and suited to drag-based propulsion through
fluids. From these simplest designs, myriad locomotion strategies have evolved.
The model microswimmer Escherichia coli is peritrichously flagellated—bundles
of rigid (prokaryotic) flagella rotate synchronously in the same sense to elicit
forward swimming (a ‘run’), but lose synchrony and unbundle (a ‘tumble’)
when one or more of the motors reverse direction (see [7] and references therein).
