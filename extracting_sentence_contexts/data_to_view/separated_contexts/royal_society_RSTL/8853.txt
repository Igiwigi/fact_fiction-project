On the whole, the trabecule, or interocular tracts, chondrify first ; then the inter-
auditory, or parachordals; and, lastly, the internasal, or fore ends of the trabecule. The development of true (arrested) vertebrae in the head is possible as far as the
three essential elements go, namely, the notochord and its pair of investing mesoblastic
tracts. As a fact, such segments, even below the hind brain, are imperfect and transient ;
under the other two vesicles they are impossible, and in the early embryo only slight
traces of somatomic division can be seen, even in the region of the hind brain.

We now come to two causes of modification of the basal plates that are very important,
namely, divarication of the paired tracts, and obstruction of the unpaired axis ; the latter
is the most important of the two. The rapid growth of the brain-yesicles, as they turn over the bent skeletal axis, causes
the floor of the membranous primordial cranium to bulge, and this bulging affects the
hardening bands that are ready to begin to build the © chondrocranium.”

The middle tracts (trabecule), although starting from the sides of the apex of the
notochord, curve round the infero-lateral regions of the brain-sac, and in an early state
are merely like two horns, gently curved outwards from their origin, and far apart at

their tips (Plate 22. fig. 1, tr.).

a At their beginning, however, these outbent bars have the notochord between them,

S «0 that the posterior trabecular region has in it all the elements that go to form
yertebre.
