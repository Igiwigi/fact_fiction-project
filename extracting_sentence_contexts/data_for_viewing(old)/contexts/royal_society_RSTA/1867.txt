The two oppositely & equally electrically charged radicals then
attract each other & unite to form a neutral molecule

Perhaps more interestingly, there is also a visionary speculation on whether the elements might
have been formed in a process analogous to Darwinian evolution. The scene is first set:

At the present day the position of the chemist
