In this last case, a quite different mechanism
takes over. However, they also note that representations of
visual numerosities can be influenced by auditory numeros-
ities, and vice versa, suggesting that humans do indeed
represent number amodally.

6. Genetics

The fact that newborn chicks, fish and human neonates can make
numerical discriminations suggests that this capacity does not
arise as a result of interaction with the environment, but is inher-
ited though subsequent interaction with environment doubtless
modifies and refines the operation of this mechanism. It is also
the case, as Butterworth [2] points out, that individual differ-
ences in numerical abilities have a substantial genetic


component, perhaps as much as 30% of the variance in systema- may be learned from studies of animals far removed from | 4 |

tic twin studies. This suggests that the starter kit for learning humans on the evolutionary bush (zebra fish, for example)
arithmetic in school includes a domain-specific mechanism for may reveal mechanisms for representing abstract quantities a
representing numerosities, and that individual differences in in their brains that are also found in human brains.
