We were unable to determine the position of the protoxylem in the vascular

bundles of the lamina,
The leaf possessed a distinct hypodermal layer beneath the epidermis of the upper
= surface (see photograph 7 and fig. 16). The epidermis itself is not so well-preserved
as the mesophyll, but in one or two places the stomata can be recognized. The clearest
is seen in sectional view in fig. 164. Here there seems to be no doubt, that we have
the two guard cells (g.c.), lying at the base of a depression formed by the prominent
subsidiary cells. We have so far found no trace of stomata on the upper surface of
the leaf.

The lamina of the leaf occasionally has outgrowths on its lower surface, similar to
those on the petiole and stem (see photograph 7 and fig. 16). It is a curious fact,
that in the best sections of the leaf, almost every cell contains a round mass of
carbonaceous matter, very suggestive of a nucleus. We do not desire to lay any
Stress on this appearance, but its constancy in the best preserved preparations is
certainly remarkable, (See photograph 7 and fig. 16.)

The following conclusions result from our observations :—

1. The lamina of the leaf in Zyginodendron had a distinctly bi-facial structure with
well differentiated palisade and spongy parenchyma.
