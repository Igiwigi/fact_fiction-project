e-mail: emily_meineke@fas.harvard.edu The Anthropocene is a new geological epoch proposed to recognize the
significant impact humans have had on Earth’s biogeochemical cycles, biodi-
versity and ecosystems [1]. Because geological epochs are defined by
demonstrable changes in Earth’s stratigraphy—captured in glaciers, rock, or
sediment resulting from myriad factors including meteor strikes, alterations
in global cooling or warming, sea-level change and volcanism—whether the
Anthropocene is a genuine epoch and, if so, when it began, remain debated.
This is largely attributable to the fact that the Anthropocene has not been
defined by conventional geological impacts, but rather by human influences.
This has made timing the starting point of the Anthropocene, following the
Holocene epoch, challenging and controversial. The most plausible strati-
graphic signatures of the Anthropocene include megafaunal extinctions,
evidence for widespread agriculture, ash particles from burning, radionucleo-
tide fallout and persistent industrial chemicals, including plastics and other
decay-resistant chemicals. Here, clear ‘golden spikes’, which are global, near
simultaneous signatures in strata that demarcate this epoch are debated.
A prevailing, but by no means universally adopted, view favours either
1610 or 1964. The former coincides with the widespread arrival of Europeans
work. to the Americas, which triggered precipitous human population declines in
