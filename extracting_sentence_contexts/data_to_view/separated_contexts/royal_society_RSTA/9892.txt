The differences in & are only what should have been expected, since / depends on
the adjustments. With regard to kW, the values for pressure and tension should theoretically be
qual and opposite. For if light traverse a thickness 7 of glass in which a residual
fension T, exists, a term OT,r is added to the relative retardation when external
Sension is applied and subtracted from it when external pressure is applied.

2 Again \, should be a constant for the glass, and therefore the same for tension and

@ressure, if the stress-optical coefficient be independent of the nature and magnitude

Bf the load applied.

& Now Table ILI. shows clearly that, although the values of /W, differ in sign, they

Bie only very roughly of the same order of magnitude.

% Possibly this might be accounted for by the fact that in different experiments the

Bight did not pass through the same parts of the glass, so that the value of the

‘gesidual stress might have been different.

5 The divergences in \, are considerable; , appears systematically larger for

“Pressure than for tension,*
