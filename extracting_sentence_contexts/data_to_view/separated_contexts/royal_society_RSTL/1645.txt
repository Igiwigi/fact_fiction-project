If the worms are kept in a considerable quantity of water,
and the water is frequently changed, the worms very s0o0n
die in the water, or if taken out whilst yet alive, and suffered
to dry on the glass, they remain dead; but if the young
worms are kept only in a moderate quantity of water in a
watch-glass, the mucus, or glutinous substance, rises, and, in
about twelve hours, forms a film on the surface of the water,
and s0on becomes nearly opaque, and sinks again upon the
worms at the bottom of the glass, and in that state the worms
continue alive more than two months ; but if that film be
carefully scummed' off, the worms in the water die in less
than twelve hours. This glutinous substance must be secreted by the worms ;
since in grains in which the worms and the fungi or smut-
balls exist, that portion of the cellular tissue of the young
germens, where a worm has formed its nest and laid its eggs,
is entirely preserved ; whilst in those portions of the grains
which are immediately in contact with the fungi, the cellular
tissue entirely disappears, and the fungi are only enveloped
by the external tunic of the young germen. Fromthese facts, we are to consider this glutinous substance
as the' probable cause of preserving these minute animals for
such a length of time. What is recorded of the shell-snail,
which- can,. by its own' mucus, hermetically seal itself for
thirty years'in its'shell against a wall, is similar to this: when

it recovers.
