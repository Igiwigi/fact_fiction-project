the gravitational MHV amplitude came from a twistor Lagrangian approach, and this perspective DN
has been maintained in the more recent work following up the determinantal formula. The work =
of David Skinner [40] goes back to the twistor-string picture and in particular brings in the :B
remarkable fact, which so far has not been much exploited, that twistor geometry can represent de ,
Sitter or anti-de Sitter space just as well as Minkowski space. The only modification necessary is
that the ‘infinity twistor’ becomes non-degenerate. This non-degenerate Iyg fits elegantly into
a determinantal structure. In this approach, gravity is naturally formulated within this more
general setting, and flat-space properties extracted by taking a (non-trivial) limit. Since then,
further work on ambitwistor strings by Geyer et al. [41] has forged a strong connection between
twistor geometry and the work of Cachazo et al. [42] which has given the most powerful extension
of the determinantal structure, including contact with both KLT and BCJ relations.

The questions raised by this investigation are not in fact restricted to the gravitational setting.

Even in gauge theory we are faced by the problem of how to escape the restriction to ring-ordered
partial amplitudes, so as to express the relationships between components from different ring-
order sectors, and to express the non-planar components of amplitudes. The situation seems to
call for some striking new idea that will connect these various questions and approaches.

10. From the 1970s to the 2010s

Roger Penrose’s original motivation for twistor theory was that it would give a radically
new framework for the description of physics. Although twistor-geometric descriptions of
known physical phenomena must necessarily be consistent with standard space-time theory,
the twistorial reformulation would suggest new ideas which would not or could not have been
