No
left superior intercostal vein could be found in this embryo. In no other foetus examined did the occlusion of the primitive left jugular vein ex-
I fend quite up to the cross branch or left innominate vein ; for there always remained
Ra pervious but shrunken portion of the primitive vessel, which, as will immediately
be shown, forms the trunk of the left superior intercostal vein. This fact is illustrated
Zin fig. 5, 7. In a 8omewhat later embryo (fig. 6), the cord of the occluded vein may
She traced distinetly from the trunk of the left superior intercostal vein (i, which is here
Slarger than usual), passing down through the fibrous layer of the pericardium, and
Zentering its now narrow fold of the serous membrane (c"). Still later (Plate IV. fig. 9).
