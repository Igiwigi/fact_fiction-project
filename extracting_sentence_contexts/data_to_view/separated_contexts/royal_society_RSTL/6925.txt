unity, and the reduced form is uw + +45, with the relation u+v+w=0. JT and K being zero, D will be 80 too, and accordingly the equation uw*+w*+ Pu*=0 will have two equal
roots, Tt will easily be found that these equal roots correspond to the system of ratios u=1, v=i?, w=. In fact, if we write u=1 +6, v=®+1g, w=i+0#%, the equation becomes uw+1*+1%u*=g*(30p+3g*)=0. Hence, understanding by e either of the two prime sixth roots of unity, the complete system of ratios of uw, v, w
may be expressed as follows ;—

u=1 v=s? ws
u=1 v=i? was
u=1— 10 v=i?— 4/10 w=i—F 10

u=1+ 10s v=e\— 4/10 w=e*+ 106
w=zl+ 106 v=e'+ 4/108 w=ze— 4/10. Thus, when J=0 and-K=0, u, v, w (with the relation u4+v+w=0) may firzt be”found, in terms of w, y, by

will be known from the above system of values for any two of the quantities u, v, w.

(*) Tt is obvious that the form aa +da%y? gives J=0 and K=0 ; but it seems desirable to proye the converse,
viz. that when J=0 and K=0, but not L=0, the form is always reducible to a +103u%?, which may be done
as follows.
