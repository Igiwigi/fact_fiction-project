mine (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, resulting in a
deficiency of DA in the striatum. PD patients develop a triad of motor symp-
toms: akinesia, rigidity and tremor. The aetiology of neuronal death in PD is
still unclear. Several possible mechanisms of degeneration in dopaminergic
neurons might occur in addition to genetic factors: formation of free radicals,
oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, excitotoxicity, calcium-induced
neurodegeneration, altered production of neurotrophic factors, inflammatory
processes, environmental factors and toxic action of nitric oxide [1-3]. These
multiple factors reciprocally interact inducing a vicious cycle of toxicity that
causes altered synaptic plasticity, morphological changes and finally cell death.
The current therapeutic approaches only alleviate the clinical symptoms, but
they cannot cure the disease by changing the natural course of this disorder. In
fact, until now, no therapy has been developed to stop or at least slow down the
neurodegeneration occurring in dopaminergic neurons in PD patients.
Levodopa (3,4-dihydroxy-l-phenylalanine, L-DOPA) is a precursor of DA and
it represents the first and most successful breakthrough in the symptomatic treat-
ment of PD. In fact, DA replacement therapy with L-DOPA is still the gold
standard for symptomatic treatment of PD. However, patients usually experience
