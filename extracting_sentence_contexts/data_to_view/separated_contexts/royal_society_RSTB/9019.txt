However, the generation of single cell sus-
pension of hiPSCs is characterized by high cell loss due to
dissociation-induced apoptosis after passaging as single
cells, which could be solved by the use of Rho kinase inhibi-
tors, such as Y-27632 or ROCKi [142]. Another way to
circumvent this problem is dissociation into aggregates
because it has been shown that microcarrier cultures of
PSCs can also be seeded with cell aggregates/clumps and
that single cell suspensions are not required [143]. The only
issue of importance is the fact that the size of aggregates
has to be uniform during the culture, which is achieved by
agitation generating the required turbulences (see above). Dissociation of cultures into aggregates can be achieved
by using other proteases and agents, including collagenase
IV, dispase or hypertonic Na-citrate solution. In this context,
Nie et al. [106] showed that the use of hypertonic Na-citrate
solution led to superior results with respect to viability and
total viable cell number obtained over several passages
when compared with detachment using collagenase, dispase
or mechanical methods (order of decreasing efficiency).
