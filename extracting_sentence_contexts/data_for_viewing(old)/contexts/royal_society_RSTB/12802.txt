dium until 28hpf, ie. until the deposition of the first
rosette and the maturation of the second one, and then in
removing a group of cells. Before ablation, the PLL proto-
organ is constituted (going from left to right) by a deposited
rosette (with E cells) and a migrating placode comprising a
rostral mature proto-neuromast with pE agents, two rosettes
with dPM cells, and a leading group of PM individuals (as in
figure 4i). The configuration in figure 6a is then obtained by
removing a cluster of progenitor PM cells just behind the
head of the main mass of the migrating primordium, and
by neglecting the presence of the deposited proto-neuromast.
Consistently with the phenotypic characterization employed
so far, the remaining caudal fragment is in fact formed by
Cxcr4-expressing PM individuals only, whereas the trailing
portion is formed by Cxcr7-expressing pE agents, as well as
by aPM (the centre of the rosettes) and dPM cells, all
having Cxcr4. The initial gap between the two clusters is
larger than 2d,, ie. laser ablation initially inhibits adhesive
