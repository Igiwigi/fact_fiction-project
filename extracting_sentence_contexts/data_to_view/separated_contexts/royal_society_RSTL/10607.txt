between the pole-pieces by the: current in the armature would be more troublesome
than an @ priort analysis of the distribution of field in this space when the magnet
current is the only magnetising force. Owing to the fact that the armature is divided
into a finite number of sections there is a rapid diminution of the displacement of the
field during the time that a section is being commutated, the diminution. being
