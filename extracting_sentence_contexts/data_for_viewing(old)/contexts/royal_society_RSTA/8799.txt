‘ Hydrodynamics,’ p. 304, 1906 edition, where the expression ¢ = aor cos K (ch —) occurs for the height
of a long wave in a long rotating canal. The above expression is an obvious modification of this.


MR. G. I. TAYLOR ON TIDAL FRICTION IN THE IRISH SEA. 29

For this analysis to be correct, the co-tidal line at « = 0, #.¢., the line for 8h. 10m.
should be perpendicular to the direction in which the wave has been assumed to be
moving, 7.¢., perpendicular to the middle line of the channel. As a matter of fact
the angle between the co-tidal line AB, and the central line LM, differs considerably
from a right angle. This is no doubt due partly to modifications introduced by the
fact that the channel has not got parallel sides, but more probably it is due to the
fact that the tidal wave from the Atlantic does not strike the channel in such a way
as to allow the co-tidal line for 6h. 15m. to be at such an angle with the direction of
the middle line of the channel as to allow it to become perpendicular to the channel
(owing to the co-tidal line travelling faster on the Welsh side than on the Ivish side)
when it has travelled up the channel as far as the line AB.

It is worth while, however, to apply equation (46) to find out what angle the
co-tidal line would have turned through, theoretically, in the time from 6h. 15m. to
8h. 10m.

The angle, 0, between the co-tidal line for 6h. 15m. and the co-tidal line for 8h. 10m.
should be given by
