As RicHarDsoN
points out, this experiment shows clearly that the very small negative leak given by
platinum in air is not due to traces of hydrogen in the platinum. In addition,
measurements of the negative leak from clean platinum wires in air and other gases,
except hydrogen, give fairly concordant results, so that I think there is now no doubt
that there is a small negative leak due to the platinum itself. In fact, since traces of
hydrogen in the surface of the platinum must be burnt up at once when it is heated
in air, it is almost impossible that such traces could be the cause of the small leak
given in air, This conclusion, of course, does not apply to the much larger leaks
which are obtained when an ordinary platinum wire is heated in a vacuum without
any special precautions. I think there is no doubt that they are due, as I suggested,
to traces of hydrogen. In the present paper, when the negative leak in hydrogen is
referred to, it is not intended to imply that there is not a small negative leak due to
the platinum itself.
