The point of exact transition between one orthogonal system and the next
is marked by a phyllotaxis index terminating in -94, and so on. The parastichy relations
then may be stated directly from these numbers just as in the Fibonacci systems, but the
values at orthogonality are no longer the integers. The correction factor of 1-44 units has been used in deriving the orthogonal values
theoretically from those of Fibonacci systems, but it should be made quite clear that in
calculating the phyllotaxis index of a bijugate apex from measurements taken on trans-
verse sections, the correction factor to add is only one-half this, i.e. 0-72 of a unit, which
allows for the fact that two leaves appear during each ‘plastochrone’; or the correction
may be applied earlier in the calculation by dividing log,)r (observed) by 2—this will
automatically be done in the calculation of r if the primordia present are numbered in the
manner shown in figure 4. A plane trijugate system, whose parastichy numbers are Fibonacci terms multiplied by
three, may be treated in a similar manner to the bijugate; it may be divided by any three
equally inclined radii into sectors, each of which may be rolled into a cone that then dis-
plays a Fibonacci system and whose apical angle is twice sin~! 4. This gives log,) 3 for the
difference between the log,, log,)r (observed) of one-third of the plane trijugate system and
that of its full circular Fibonacci counterpart.
