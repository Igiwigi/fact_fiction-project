The silver, lead, and copper elec-
trodes readily dissolve as nitrates, the copper one s00n becoming coated with an azure-
blue deposit. Mercury dissolves only slightly, but its surface becomes covered with a
grey deposit. Zine and magnesium dissolve as nitrates, but somewhat more slowly
than the other metals mentioned, a fact probably to be accounted for by their tendency
to direct or local action upon the nitrate. , |
