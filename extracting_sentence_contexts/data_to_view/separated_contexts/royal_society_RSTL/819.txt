Having thus satisfied myself that no injury to the knife
edges was to be apprehended from moderate use, the pendu-
lum was again suspended, but now, to my surprise, I found
the number of vibrations different from what they were
before the re-measurement. This difference became still
greater on the following day, and it at length occurred to
me that the moisture of the atmosphere must have under-
gone some change, and that an alteration had been thus
occasioned in the weight of the wooden extremities of the
pendulum. On referring to the register of the hygrometer


76 Capt. KaTER's experiments for determining the

kept by Mr. Browne, it was found that a considerable
change had in fact suddenly taken place from moisture to
dryness ; and, 50 great was the derangement of the pendu-
lum from this apparently trivial cause, that it became neces-
sary to move the second weight. This was accordingly done,
and the following experiments made for again bringing the
number of vibrations to an equality. Slider 29 divisions.
