â€˜ It is quite true, that a good hay crop may contain as much as 50 to 60 kilog. of
nitrogen per hectare, but it may safely be affirmed that, in ordinary practice, even in
the case of an unusually fertile meadow, such an amount is not annually removed for a
number of years in succession, without the periodical return of manure supplying
nitrogen; whilst, taking the average of soils, the annual yield will not reach the

amount supposed, even with the ordinary periodic return, and without such return
gradual exhaustion would be very marked. Indeed, it is well known that there is no-
more exhausting practice than the annual removal of hay without return of manure ;
so that, in point of fact, restoration in anything like the degree supposed certainly
does not take place. Next to the removal of hay, the consumption of grass for the
production of milk is the most, but still very much less, nitrogen-exhausting ; whilst
if the grass be consumed by store or fattening animals, the loss is very much less still ;
indeed it is very small.

Obviously, however, it is more important to consider, what is the probable average
loss of nitrogen over a given area by the removal of crops generally, and not by that
of grass alone. Moreover, in making such an estimate it is not the total nitrogen of
the crops that has to be reckoned; but, taking into account the return by manure, only
the amount eventually lost to the soil. With the great variation according to cireum-
stances, it is of course very difficult to estimate this at all accurately ; but we may
state that two independent modes of estimate lead to the conclusion that, for Great
