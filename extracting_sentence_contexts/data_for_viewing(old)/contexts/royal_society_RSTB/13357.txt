the standard cross-cultural sample does still have substantial
and significant autocorrelation [83], and it is better to tackle
the problem head-on with phylogenetic methods rather than
hoping that a stratified sample is sufficient [84].

A number of recent approaches have instead actively
sought to quantify the relative contributions of ancestry, dif-
fusion and/or environmental selection to a variety of cross-
cultural phenomena that are highly variable in their
expression (e.g. [9,85,86]). These studies have relied on the
analyses of large global datasets, using phylogenetic methods
(ie. phylogenetic regression; figure 1b) that take advantage of
the fact that neighbouring societies are not always close rela-
tives and/or do not always inhabit similar environments
(hence allowing the methods to partial out the relative effects
of each driver, e.g. [10,85,86]).

In these studies, the potential for horizontal diffusion has
often been assumed to be proportional to either the trait’s rep-
resentation within nearby cultural ‘neighbourhoods’ (e.g. [85])
or the geographic proximity to neighbouring groups (e.g. [9]).
However, these proxies are likely to be problematic. Specifi-
cally, neighbourhood proxies will often suggest a high
potential for cultural diffusion if the trait of interest is spatially
clustered, regardless of whether diffusion actually existed.
