This independence must be
absolute in Bip. asterigera. At the same time we see in the Solaster larva (29, p. 47) a case where the
dorsal nerve centre, though imperfectly represented, is carried at metamorphosis into the area where the
nerve ring is developing, while in the Echinid larva, as MACBRIDE has shown (57), there is a definite nerve
centre dorsal to the mouth entrance, though it takes no part in the formation of the adult nervous system. Parallel facts are to be found in the case of other Echinoderms, and if we take Balanoglossus into account
we shall probably be justified in concluding (1) that the bilateral ancestor had a circumoral nerve ring
or commissure with dorsal and ventral nerve centres; (2) that the various types of echinoderm larve
have developed only what they actually required in the way of a nervous system, and that the adult
circumoral nerve ring is now in some cases entirely, and in others almost entirely, an independent
formation ; (3) the phylogenetic derivation of this ring from the circumoral nervous circuit of the
ancestor is, in the absence of contrary evidence, a reasonable possibility. As regards the crinoids, if it
be correct (p. 255) to say that the stalk represents phylogenetically a preoral lobe which has become
twisted towards the right instead of towards the left side, we may perhaps find in the neuro-muscular
fibres of the anterior part of the ancestral larva a starting point for the remarkable development of the
apical entoneural nervous system which is characteristic of this class. We must be careful to note that in A. rubens, at metamorphosis, the insertion of
the larval stalk into the body is outside (7.e., not surrounded by) the developing oral
circular nerve tract.
