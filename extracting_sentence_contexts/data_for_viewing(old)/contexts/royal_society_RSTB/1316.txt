The archless body portion of vertebra « is produced by the anterior half of sklero-
tome a+ 1. L

The arteries lie in level of the myocommata, i.¢., they are interprotovertebral.*

The nerves lie in level of the myotomes, 7.c., they are protovertebral.

Later on, nerve XXI. belongs to vertebra X., 7.¢., lies behind its vertebra.

It is easily seen that the results arrived at by Remax, GrGenBAuR, and Corninc
are all different, and cannot be reconciled with each other.

In fact, it had long been felt that there was something unsatisfactory in this
generally-accepted expression “neugliederung,” or new segmentation. O. HErtwic
(‘Lehrbuch der Entwicklungsgeschichte der Menschen und der Wirbelthiere,’ Jena,
1888, p. 473) pointed out that the expression is not correct, because, as long as the
axial column is still in the membranous stage, there is no segmentation in it, and
it is only when cartilage makes its appearance that “ gliederung” makes its ‘appear-
ance. This argumentation does not quite meet the point.

However, it is misspent energy to seek the solution of the mystery of resegmenta-
tion in birds and reptiles. The necessity of overlapping of contractile and passive
segments has been met with before any Amniota came into existence, even long
before there was anything like a segmented vertebral column; it is ready in
Dipnoi and Holocephali, which have no segmented centra in their axial skeleton,
