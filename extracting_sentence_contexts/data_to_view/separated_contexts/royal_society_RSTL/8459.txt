In fact, however, my mill, which requires 15 seconds to come
to rest from 10 revolutions, does not take 30 to come to rest from 100 revolutions. In these experiments the wheel was set in motion by turning the envelope, and not by
the aid of light or heat. We have, therefore, conclusive evidence that the resistance
is not merely that of the pivot (which, in fact, is 80 small as to be inappreciable); and
the only other resistance of which we know*Â® is that of the air. But this is not all. The behaviour of the mill furnishes us with the exact law of the resistance ; and this
is identical with the law of the resistance of air in a highly rarefied condition, a law
distinctly special in its character.
