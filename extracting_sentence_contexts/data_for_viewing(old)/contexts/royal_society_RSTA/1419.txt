across larger and longer scales. The fact that CanWE#4 and mostly #6 are more frequent during
the core phase of the monsoon, when the large-scale low-level monsoon flow takes place and can
sustain longer and larger WEs, seems to confirm this interpretation. Future studies examining
the dynamical and thermodynamical environments of the CanWEs are needed to support this
hypothesis. In particular, the possible modulation of CanWEs due to synoptic-scale LPS and
tropical cyclones, or regional-scale intraseasonal oscillations, needs to be deeply explored.

The CanWE framework may also be useful in predictability studies. The seasonal prediction
of rainfall associated with the boreal summer monsoon across India is a difficult task [54-58] due
partly to the large impact of a few extreme days [59,60]. We may hypothesize that CanWE#3 and
#5 are more difficult to predict than CanWE#4 and #6 given their spatial extent and duration. The

fact that CanWE#5 is responsible for most annual maximum hourly rainfall also poses a serious : =
challenge in the prediction of extreme rainfall, and may also potentially blur the interannual : =

Regarding the current and future variability of rainfall amounts and extremes, the : S
CanWE framework may help decipher the role of thermodynamical versus dynamical factors oâ„¢

[25,61]. In particular, if our physical interpretation is correct, CanWE#3 and #5 may relate to
