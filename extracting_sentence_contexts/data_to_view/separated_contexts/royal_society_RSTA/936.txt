The second is that in solutions
weaker than 12Â° the recorded values of solvation are higher. The first result is very unexpected because all the other available evidence such as
that obtained from experiments on the sorption of acetone vapour by nitrocotton
makes it almost inevitable that the total solvation must increase with the activity of
the acetone. It is possible to account for the observed facts only by supposing that
in addition to the acetone some water must be absorbed. This absorption of water
can hardly be continuous throughout the whole range of acetone concentration but
must begin or at least become much more marked at the solution point. The idea that the apparent sorption of acetone, as determined in this way, was the
effect of the attachment of water and acetone separately, say, the acetone on the nitro-
groups and the water on the hydroxyl groups, was considered at one time.
