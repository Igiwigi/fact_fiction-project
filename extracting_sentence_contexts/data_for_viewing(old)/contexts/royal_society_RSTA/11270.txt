8 shallower or less numerous than usual.
Hence the main easterly drift is weaker on its northern margin, and the direction
8 of movement is more to the southward, the chief region of banked-up water, the
g Source of the northward-moving currents, is further south, and the currents receive
© less direct aid from the surface drifts.. The relatively high pressure in the higher
% latitudes would give weaker westerly winds in the Atlantic, and therefore a weaker
= drift circulation, and less spreading of the Labrador stream water eastward. The
€ drift delivery northward on the eastern side would be less, the winds being weaker
and more westerly ; but, on the other hand, the southward deflection of the main
8 cyclone track would increase the easterly component of the winds between Iceland
© and Spitsbergen. The water sent northward by the current from the coast of Europe
g would therefore tend to mix less with the water underlying it, and on reaching the
Q Spitsbergen region to drift westwards. We know, as a matter of fact, that. an
unusually large area west and south-west of Spitsbergen was open during 1897—
probably the result of the enormous amount of warm water sent up in the preceding
year, and that the open area was covered to an unusual extent by Atlantic
water (47).

The supplies of Atlantic water being smaller, and the ice more remote, in 1897
than in 1896, the increase of the Polar streams in autumn is much less marked ; hence
an unusually large area is then occupied by the warmer and salter surface waters,
and this is maintained by the peculiar atmospheric changes which take place in the
latter part of the year.
