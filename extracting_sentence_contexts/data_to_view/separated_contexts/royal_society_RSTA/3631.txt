Upon opening the first sample in a clean room, we
noted that the grey matrix contains locally abundant aggregates of purple halite (NaCl) crystals,
measuring up to 1cm in size (though most are only a few millimetres at most; figure 1). We have
not previously seen megascopic halite in any extraterrestrial sample, although microscopic halite
has been reported in the Murchison CM2 chondrite [15], several ureilites [16] and some Martian
meteorites [17-20]. In fact, some of these prior reports had been considered to be rather amazing,
but there is no reason to doubt them. Backscattered electron imaging of Monahans revealed
that crystals of sylvite (KCl) are present within the halite crystals, similar to their occurrence in
