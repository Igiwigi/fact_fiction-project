'This, however, had been already indicated, without my being aware of it at the time,

of the glass employed, would be an advantage, by dispersing, at the focus or on the
plate, beyond the photogenic lines, the red, orange or yellow rays; for the reason,
that if they were brought to the same point they would tend to neutralize and destroy
the effect of the photogenic rays. In October 1846, M. LzrgBouss announced to the Paris Academy of Sciences that
the red rays prevented the action of the photogenic rays ; this announcement induced
Messrs. FoucauLT and Fizgav to publish immediately similar results, which they had
previously consigned to the Academy in a sealed memoir, bearing date May 1846. These communications of Messrs. LEREBouss, Foucaulr and F1zeav, led Dr. Dra-
PER to write a letter, published in the Philosophical Magazine of February last, re
peating his observations on the spectrum of Virginia, adding several other analogous
facts confirming the theory of a protecting and even destroying action exercised by
the least refrangible rays. Dr. Dares, in the same letter, said that the rays which
protect the plate from ordinary photogenic action are themselves onpeble, when
isolated, of producing a peculiar photogenie effect. Soon after the publication of M. Ep.
