AFFINITIES OF ANKYROPTERIS CORRUGATA. 103

general idea of the appearance of Ankyropteris corrugata as it lived and grew. The
stem branched dichotomously at infrequent intervals, and the fact that it bore both
aphlebie and hairs superficially strongly suggests that it was aerial rather than
subterranean, whilst the large size of the petioles and their distichous arrangement
indicate that it was prostrate, a view which receives some support from the parenchy-
matous nature of its cortex and from the irregular direction of growth of the roots.
The petioles themselves were devoid of pinne and bore two rows of aphlebize, one on
either side, in addition to stiff scattered hairs which were generally distributed. They
branched dichotomously, and their circinately coiled apices and the parts immediately
below were protected by a dense covering of large stout hairs, whilst the actual tips were
hooded over and enclosed by a system of aphlebie.

The whole plant must therefore have differed widely in externals from any
existing fern, though its peculiarities appear to have been shared, in some measure
