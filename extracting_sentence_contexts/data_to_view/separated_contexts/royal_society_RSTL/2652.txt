ON AN IRON STEAM-VESSEL, 269

And at a position (No. 6) 114 feet before the tafrail, and 54 feet above
the deck, the deviation was (when the boats' davits were out) . . 11* 40 E. Ditto (when the boats davits were swung in-board) . . . . . . 6? 20' E.*#

The preceding facts showing the influence of small portions of iron in the vicinity
of the compass, may be worthy the attention of the practical navigator; for it will he
seen by the results obtained at a position not far from the binnacle, that the differ-
ence of deviation amounted to no less than 5* 20' under the mere circumstance of
swinging the quarter-boat's davits in-board from their usual position where the boats
are hoisted up, to that place in which they would be secured in stormy weather
at sea. Bearing in mind the practical question of placing a steering-compass as near to
a convenient part of the deck as possible, and not considering the local attraction
developed by the preceding obseryations at No. 5. and No. 6. excessive, I fixed on
positions near to them for placing the azimuth compassesF;, viz. A and B.
