ters at a temperature much below that at which they melt, and that the results of dif-
ferent analyses of the same portions of resin are thus liable to be modified to a con-
siderable extent.

It was my intention to have included in the present paper some new analyses of the
resin of dragon's blood, already examined in the first part of these researches, and of
the new resins produced by the action of quicklime and of oxide of lead on the several

+ TI have not adverted to the apparent difference between this resin and the resin C,, Hy, Os, that namely of
the elements of two atoms of water only. I am unwilling to adopt the opinion that any of the resins contain
water as a constituent, till we have some distinct facts on which to rest ; but there can be no difficulty in al-
lowing that, under certain circumstances, one resin may be transformed into another by assimilating the ele-
ments of one or more atoms of water.

have extended 80 much, that I think it better to reserve them for a future opportunity ;
