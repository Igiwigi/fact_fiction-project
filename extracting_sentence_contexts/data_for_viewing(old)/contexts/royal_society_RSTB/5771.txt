436 C. FORSTER COOPER ON THE GENUS HYRACOTHERIUM.

Counting from the first premolar backwards, there is a slight but progressive tendency
for the two external cusps, the protocone and tritocone, to become more and more
separated from one another, but they never become so separated as in the first molar.

The Lower Molar Teeth.

So far only in this specimen and the more recently discovered fragment from Abbey
Wood has a lower dentition of H. vulpiceps been obtained, while lower teeth of H.
leporinum are at present entirely unknown. â€˜The fact that the upper and lower denti-
tions of the form under discussion are in undoubted association adds to their importance.

There is a closed series of teeth from the third molar up to the second premolar, a
short diastema of two millimetres divides the second from the first premolar, which, in
turn, is divided from the canine by a diastema of ten millimetres. A gap of three
millimetres separates the canine from the third incisor.

The first premolar has a single flattened trenchant cusp, the second is similar but with
the addition of a small anterior cusp and a posterior talonid : a small diastema separates
these two teeth. In the third premolar the antero-internal cusp is the larger and is
placed a little in front of an antero-external cusp which is rather lower; these two
cusps are somewhat pressed together. The talonid has a single cusp on the internal
