very little from that at 730°C. The furnace temperature was then raised very slightly,
and, before the thermocouple registered 734° C., a rapid fall of magnetisation set in.

This fall is absent or imperceptibly small in the iron curve and is smallest in that
3 for the steel weakest in carbon. Its relative magnitude increases with the percentage
2 of carbon, as fig. 1 shows, until the specimen containing 0'7 per cent. of carbon is

‘4 reached. After that, it is difficult to decide whether the ratio of the rapid fall

3 (below 740° C.) to the subsequent fall, before the magnetisation becomes too small to
be measurable, depends appreciably upon the percentage of carbon.

The first important fact, then, is that the sudden loss of magnetism begins at the
= same temperature in all the steels. This accords with the view that the eutectoid
£& patches, detected by the microscope, have always the same composition. It might
; also suggest that this constant temperature is the true transition point between
eutectoid and homogeneous solid solution.

That this inference would be wrong may be shown in two different ways. Fig. 2
shows one. The curves relate to successive interrupted heatings, of a steel containing
0°85 per cent. of carbon, described later.* At the moment it is only necessary to
call attention to the descending branches of the different curves. It will be noticed
that two (Nos. 4 and 5) proceed vertically downwards and one (No. 2) slopes slightly
outwards from left to right. The significant one, for the present purpose, slopes
inwards, ¢.e. towards the left. It (No. 3) was obtained with the most gradual rate
