On the other hand, in many occasions, emerging flux
acts primarily as a trigger for the eruption of a pre-existing filament ([24,25]).

(a) Observational examples

An observational survey of eruptions [24] reported that for most of the eruptions studied there : S
was new flux emerging at the close neighbourhood of a filament. They found that flux emergence : =
started a few days before the ejective eruption of the filament, which indicates that the interaction : a
between the emerging field and the pre-existing magnetic field of (or enveloping) the filament : =
triggered the eruption. In fact, it was reported that the orientation between the two interacting : =
magnetic flux systems was such that efficient reconnection between them occurred, leading to the [3
onset of a CME. Moreover, it was found that eruptions were not observed in most of the cases : =
where flux emergence did not occur nearby the filament. The authors stated that these results are 8
indicative but not conclusive of whether flux emergence is a necessary condition for the onset of : o
eruptions. is

Another observational study [26] presented a statistical survey, comprising newly emerging : =
and well-developed ARs and CME-source regions, towards understanding the relationship : 3
between surface magnetic field variation and CME initiation.
