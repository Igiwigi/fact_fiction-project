In a recent paper in the ‘ Lancet’ (2.1.04) Lamp and Hunrer have approached
this subject purely from the histological point of view, and have found definite
evidence that some of the centres in the medulla oblongata, and markedly the tenth
(motor) and twelfth nuclei, were attacked by Cobra venom. I may add that my own
work was finished and that my conclusions had been formulated before I saw their
paper. Working on entirely different lines from Lams and Hunter, and without any
communication with them, I have been simultaneously led to conclusions which
strongly support those which they have arrived at.

Whilst insisting strongly that Cobra venom has a powerful and important central
action, I have also admitted the motor nerve-end paralysis on which RaGorzi
and others have laid so much stress, and have indicated the conditions under
which alone I found such paralyses to oceur. The very fact that they progress whilst
artificial respiration is actively maintaining life in the important medullary centres, is
most significant in its bearing on treatment. In the experiment shown on Plate XIV.
one can trace the partial recovery of an animal from the effects of a large dose ot
Cobra venom; but running through the whole tracing is evidence which can hardly
be interpreted otherwise than as an indication of gradually increasing interference
with the passage of respiratory impulses from the centre to the muscles.

Racorzi has shown that, in the case of Cobra poisoning of an isolated limb, it is
