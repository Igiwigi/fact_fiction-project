If we were to suppose that an eddy conserves the momentum of the layer in which
it originated so that U.+w’ = U., and V,+v’ = V.,, where 2, is the height of the layer
in question, we could obtain the values of the integrals in the same way that we did
in the case of heat transference. In the case of heat transference, owing to the small
value of the ordinary coefficient of “ molecular” conductivity, the only way in which
an eddy can lose its temperature is by mixture; but in the case of transference of
momentum the eddy can lose or gain velocity owing to the existence of local variations
in pressure over a horizontal plane. Such variations are known to exist; they are in
fact a necessary factor in the production of disturbed motion, and they enter into all
calculations respecting wave motion. We cannot, therefore, leave them out of our
calculations without further consideration, though it will be seen that they probably
do not affect the value of the integral (3) when it is taken over a large area. Consider a particular case of disturbed motion.
