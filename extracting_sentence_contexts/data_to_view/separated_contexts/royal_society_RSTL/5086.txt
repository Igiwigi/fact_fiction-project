He
further states, that the total area of all the spinal nerves cut transversely is many
times greater than the area of a transverse section of the chord above the first
cervical nerve. Opposed to that of VoLkManv is the opinion of KG6L1tker®, who
holds that the white columns of the chord are composed entirely of fibres derived
from the spinal nerves. This opinion is founded on the fact pointed out by him,—
and about the same time by myself,—that at least a large proportion of both roots,
after passing through various parts of the grey snbstance, pursue a longitudinal
course within the white columns. He further maintains, in opposition to VOLKMANN,
that these columns do really increase progressively towards the brain, and that the
nerve-fibres of which they mainly consist, do not recover their original diameter
which they lost in passing through the grey substance. From these facts he calcu-
lates that the white columns are sufficiently large in the cervical region to give
passage to all the spinal nerves, and that they form the channels of communication
to and from the brain.
