For example,
the complete graph has very low complexity, due to its highly symmetric nature, but the tree-
width is in this case maximal. On the other hand, the rank-width is one for both trees and complete
graphs. In fact, it turns out that the graphs of rank-width one are exactly the distance-hereditary
graphs, see [23]. We start by defining the cut-rank of a graph. To do this, we will use the following notation
for a graph G with vertices V and adjacency matrix I and two subsets of the vertices A,B C V;
IA, B] is the |A| x |B|-matrix describing the connections between the sets A and B.
