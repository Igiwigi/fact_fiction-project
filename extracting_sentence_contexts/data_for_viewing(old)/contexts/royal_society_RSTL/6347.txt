one; but as no election has been made of a like unique process of contraction,‚Äù this is
not the case with respect to the passage down from any term to the term at the foot of
the column (or bottom term) by a 8uccession of contractions. ;

Every term gives by the last expansion @ term above it; it can therefore be obtained
from such term above it by means of a contraction. But the contraction of the upper
term is by hypothesis such that, performing upon the contracted term the last expansion,
we obtain the upper term ; a contraction, which, performed on any term, gives a lower
term, which by performing upon it the last expansion reproduces the first mentioned
or upper term, may be called @ reverstble contraction. And it is clear that if we perform
on the top term all the reversible contractions, and on each of the resulting terms all
the reversible contractions, and 80 on as long as the process is possible, we obtain with-
out repetition all the terms of the column. The column is in fact similar to a genealo-
gical tree in the male line, cach lower term issuing from a single upper term, while each
upper term generates a lower term or terms, or does not generate any sach term, and
the top term being the common origin of the entire series. Tt may be added that when
the order of the reversible contractions of the same term is duly fixed, the alphabetical
arrangement of the terms in the column agrees with the order as of primogeniture (an
elder on and his issne male preceding all the younger sons and their respective is8ue
male) in the genealogical tree.

It. only remains then to inquire under what conditions a contraction is reversble.
Now as regards any term, in order that a contraction performed on it may be reversible,
it is necessary and sufficient that the pair produced by the contraction should be the
last expansible pair of the contracted term. "There are several cascs to be considered.
