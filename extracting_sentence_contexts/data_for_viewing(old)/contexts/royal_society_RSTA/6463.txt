presence of gauge symmetries is understood as a mere consequence of the mathematical ‘surplus |
structure’ [22] resulting from the fact that a unique physical configuration can be described 7

by using different coordinate systems [116,119,120].!? In Witten’s terms, ‘gauge symmetries are
redundancies in the mathematical description of a physical system rather than properties of
the system itself’ [124]. According to this argumentative line, the act of choosing a particular
gauge adds non-physical structure, and the corresponding gauge symmetry guarantees that the
physical or ‘observable’ predictions do not depend on this arbitrary choice (i.e. that they are
invariant under gauge transformations). It would always be possible—at least in principle—to
project the coordinate-dependent description to a coordinate-independent one in which all the
redundant ‘surplus structure’ is removed out (see for instance the notion of reduced phase space in
[109,111]). According to the received view, the fact that a coordinate-dependent description might
be useful to perform certain calculations should not blind us to the fact that the election of such a
description is only a matter of convenience.

According to the critics of the received view, the presence of gauge symmetries cannot be
reduced to a mere redundancy of the mathematical representation, but rather encodes some deep
fact about the ‘logic of nature’ [21] that has to be properly understood [53,118,125]. The main
argument to justify the search for a deep meaning of gauge symmetries is that these symmetries
seem to have non-trivial physical consequences, notably

(1) the relation between gauge symmetries and fundamental physical interactions encoded
in the heuristic gauge principle [113] (see also [21,117,121,126,127]),!5

(2) the role played by gauge symmetries in renormalization theory [128],
