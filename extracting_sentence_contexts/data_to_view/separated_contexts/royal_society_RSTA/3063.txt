The lowest estimates of our additional Earth system forcing tend to increase the allowable
emissions by a small amount for the 1.5°C warming limit, although for the median case this is
only by around 70 GtCOy, or slightly less than 2 years of recent CO2 emissions [32]. This reduces
towards zero benefit for the largest budget with levels of risk aversion of just a few per cent chance
of staying below 1.5°C (figure 5). This reflects the fact that TCRE is smaller for models at this end
of the distribution so that a given change in warming corresponds to a lower change in implied
COz emissions than in the middle or upper tail of the distribution where TCRE values are larger. The highest estimate of our additional Earth system forcing tends to decrease the allowable
cumulative emissions for 1.5°C by around 350 GtCO2 for a median risk aversion to warming. This perturbation to the allowable emissions is slightly smaller for the largest carbon budgets
(low probabilities of limiting warming below the 1.5°C) and slightly larger for the lower carbon
budgets (higher probability of limiting warming below 1.5°C).
