AND CLASSIFICATION OF THE FOSSIL REPTILIA. 99

ancestry. But, although there is a preponderance of Labyrinthodont characters in
the skeleton, they are combined with other characters only found in Reptiles; and
therefore the Labyrinthodont characters do not refer Pareiasaurus to the Labyrintho-
dontia. The type, which has lost but few Labyrinthodont characteristics, has
yet some of the most striking characters of various orders of Reptilia; and it is
upon these facts, which I now go on to state, that the conclusion must rest that
Pareiasaurus and other Reptilia exhibit evidence that the Reptilia arose from the
Amphibia by certain osteological changes which left the fundamental structure of
the skeleton substantially the same in most of its parts.

a The Reptilian Characters of Pareiasaurus.

2 The Reptilian characteristics of Pareiasawwrus which are not also common to the Laby-
Brinthodontia are few. But they comprise some of the most remarkable characteristics
Sof the Reptilia and of different Reptile orders ; and the smallness of their number is
Sevidence that they have been developed upon a basis of Labyrinthodont structure.

First, there is the large single, rounded, occipital condyle, formed of one bone.
