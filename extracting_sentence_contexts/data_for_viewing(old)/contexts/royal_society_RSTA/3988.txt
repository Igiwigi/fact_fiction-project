computational burden outside the domain of interest (e.g. a protein [12-14], a DNA strand [15],
the active centre of a protein [5], the bulk of a polymer melt [16], etc.). However, the first papers
on the subject already realized that the AMR involves a drop in ‘resolution’ free energy across the
hybrid layer. This feature has been more recently considered with interest as a way to measure free
energy differences between models. The idea has been explored in references [17-20] and adapted
to measurement of chemical potential of several types of molecules in water [17]. There have been
several works trying to unveil the statistical physics of adaptive resolution [21] and focusing on
different theoretical aspects. The group of Delle Site [22] has explored aspects of the statistical
mechanics of AdResS, whereas some of us derived an energy-conserving adaptive resolution

H-AdResS [18-20]. A perspective that is however lacking is a simple and clear thermodynamic : =
description of adaptive resolution. This work is an attempt in this direction. Thermodynamics : a
is one of the basic theories in physics, and also one of the most slippery ones. In fact, it was : 2
only after our recent work on statistical mechanics of H-AdResS that we have been able to aes
provide a glance of such a thermodynamic view. The strength of thermodynamics resides in its 22
(apparent) simplicity and its enormous ability of provide useful relations between variables [23]. : S
In this paper, we share this view and suggest several of the research lines it opens. We show DN
that thermodynamic arguments are simple and sufficient to recover the equilibrium side of the : =
statistical mechanics theory developed in [20], which starts from the Liouville equation associated [3

with the H-AdResS Hamiltonian and climbs up to the (fluid) equations of motion for the density
of conserved variables. The thermodynamic formalism is probably more agile for deriving new
relations such as those stemming from the Maxwell relations. Here, we provide no numerical tests
but rather intend to encourage the community to further research on this line.
