Whilst we meet with this admi-
wble adaptation to external conditions in the animals of these genera, there are many
zecies of the genera Mononchus and Dorylaimus found in some of the same situations,
hich are nevertheless frail and incapable of resisting desiccation. Many species of the
nus Plectus also are to be met with which do lead a constantly submerged existence,
ad to whom therefore this remarkable tenacity of life would not be a matter of 80
meh importance. These facts show that M. Davaixz's conclusions on this subject were
ga from insufficient data. An examination of tufts of moss from the roofs of houses* or from old walls, as well
zDf specimens of the yellow lichen, Parmelia parietina, from the same situations, has
vgriably revealed to me three principal kinds of animal occupants—specimens of Ro-
ſes, of peculiarly slow-moving arachnidal TardigradaF, and two or three different
inds of Anguillulide. Precisely the same varieties of animal life are spoken of as
Sting in the tufts of moss examined by SPALLANZANI, and also in those which were
Þrimented upon by Dorir® and Gavarret.
