FairBairyN towards giving quantitative expressions to these excep-
tional strains. BouGvER, RoMME, and other early writers had a very clear conception of the principal
causes of launching-strains. They call attention to the fact that in all, or nearly all,
launches the ship's bow or stern is water-borne before the other end has left the launch-
ing-ways, and that this cannot be prevented altogether even when the ways are extended
further out into the water than is customary. Some of them go s0 far as to urge the
policy of building ships in dock in order to avoid these strains, and support their opinion
by statements of the large amount of © breakage ” that takes place when a ship is set
afloat for the first time from a slip-way. Others combat this opinion, and show by actual
examples that ships built in dock also break when they are floated, although the breakage
is not always 80 considerable as when ships are launched; s0 that the severity of the
strains due to launching cannot be estimated simply by the amount of breakage.
