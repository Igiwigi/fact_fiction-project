at Ag in the interior of J is a path S € C(J,Iso(Y, X)) such that Jo is an open subinterval of J
containing 49 and S(A) is a regular pseudo-inverse for L(A) at every A € Jo. Given L € C(J, p(X, Y)),
a point Ag in the interior of J and a regular pseudo-index So for L(Ag), lemma 5.7 of [3] shows that
there exists a local parametrix S € C(Jo, Iso(Y, X)) for the path L at 49 such that S(49) = So.

For any T € W(X), its determinant can be defined by det T = detT|p where E is any finite-
dimensional subspace of X such that rge (Ix —T) CE since the determinant of the finite-
dimensional operator T|g:E—>E does not depend upon the choice of E. The mapping


det: ¥(X) > R inherits many of the usual properties from the finite-dimensional case. For
example, detT 40 if and only if T € W(X) MN Iso(X, X). Furthermore, the map T+> det T/| det T|
is continuous on W(X) NM Iso(X, X), despite the fact that det: ¥(X) —> R is not continuous when
dim X=oo. For a thorough discussion of the determinant and its role in Fredholm theory,
see [21].

The parity of a path of Fredholm operators of index zero was introduced in [22] and its role as
an index for bifurcation demonstrated in [23]. Here, as in [3], only a local version at an isolated
singular point will be required. For a path L € C(J, p(X, Y)), Ao is called an isolated singular point
of L if there exists 5 > 0 such that (Ag — 6,49 + 6) CJ and L(A) € Iso(X, Y) for all A € (Ag — 5,9 + 4)
except possibly for 4 = Ag. In this case, 5 > 0 can be chosen so that L has a local parametrix S €
C((Ap — 8, Ag + 8), Iso(Y, X)) and then S(A)L(A) € W(X) N Iso(X, X) for all 4 € (Ap — 6, Ag + 8), except
possibly for 4 =Ag. The local parity of the path L at the isolated singular point 49 can then be
defined by
