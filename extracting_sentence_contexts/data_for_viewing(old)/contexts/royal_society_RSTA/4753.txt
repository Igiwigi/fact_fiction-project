The above limit is identified as the limit of the transition bandwidth. Equations (4.8)-(4.10),
although approximated, can be employed for a preliminary design of TO MTS. It is worth noting
that in MTS-TO one should always operate close to the upper limit of this band. In fact, in this
frequency region it is possible to exploit the capability of the elements to shape the IDCs without
uncontrollable effects like onset of band-gap or excitation of other modes, which are described in
the following section.

(iii) Dynamic band (figure 6c)

Increasing the frequency beyond the transition band implies a significant deformation of the IDCs.
In fact, the dependence on frequency of the eigenvalues is very fast close to the resonance of the
