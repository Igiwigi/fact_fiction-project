Neither
does it appear that the consecutive lines are placed, as a rule, end to end, 80 as to
form one long continuous straight line by the junction of several shorter ones. On
the contrary, each series is complete in itself, and is generally placed a little to the
one or other side of those above and below it. We have in fact interrupted lines of
cells, each line the offspring of a single cell, the outer walls of which have merged
into the intercellular or hyaline tissue. When the destined number of cells forming a linear series has been developed,
each cell becomes itself a centre of growth. The granular cell enlarges, together with
its nucleus, and becomes invested with a cell-wall.
