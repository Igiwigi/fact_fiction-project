"2 This has been done, the equation being used in the form of «V" = aK’, and the
ults of the calculations are given in Tables I. and II.
8 Table I. contains the values of V and of «V* (or aK’) for those solutions in which
ig= 2, that is, in which two molecules of solute combine with the solvent to form
@e molecule of the electrolyte. Table II. contains the similar value for those
utions for which n = 3.
<1t will be noticed that in some cases the figures exhibit considerable eal ue
riation. This is to be expected from the fact that the measurements of conductivity
rad of concentration are subject to considerable experimental error. These errors
Were not specially guarded against, as our object was to establish beyond question
e nature of the variation of » with V rather than to obtain accurate measurements,
Bhich, in the present state of our knowledge, would not possess any special value. The figures for K at very high dilution are, in some cases, quite valueless as a
test of our hypothesis, on account of the enormous influence of very slight errors of
observation at these dilutions.
