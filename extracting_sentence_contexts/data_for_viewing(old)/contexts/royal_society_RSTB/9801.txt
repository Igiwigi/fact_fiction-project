(c) Actinopterygians-teleost

The structural and functional organization of the telen-
cephalon of the actinopterygian bony fishes and possible
homologies of its pallial regions with those of the other ver-
tebrates is a matter of debate. At first glance, the dorsal


telencephalon of the actinopterygians does not reveal any
similarity with that of other vertebrates. The striking differ-
ences are explained by some authors by the fact that the
telencephalon of the actinopterygians is an everted pallium,
whereas the telencephala of the other vertebrate groups
have an evaginated pallium. (cf. [29]). In the evagination
type, the walls of the embryonic telencephalon thicken and
bulge outwards encircling the lateral ventricle and divide
into the mentioned pallial and subpallial parts. In the ever-
sion type, the subpallial parts remain in a medial position
along the midline of the telencephalon, whereas the pallial
parts bend outwards and then downwards. As a conse-
quence, the medial pallium of this everted telencephalon
now occupies a lateral and increasingly ventral position.
Accordingly, there is a new ‘medial zone Dm’, continued lat-
