The F, had partly
recovered their crest, ‘die dritte Generation (F;) aber erwies sich immer wieder als
vollstiindig normal” (in this case, fully crested). This persistence of the effect
in F, appears to have been observed in the descendants of one operated female only,
His general results are, however, obviously fairly similar to the ones I have recorded,
but WotrerEcK does not present his results in a statistical way—nor, indeed, does
he appear to have made a long series of actual measurements, but contents himself
with giving figures of typical specimens. The fact that he does not mention any
reaction in F;, and only occasionally a persistence in F,, does not therefore show that
these were not present in the degree described in my own experiments, which could
only have been detected by measurements on a large scale. It is not necessary,
however, to suppose that the characters and methods employed by Wotrrereck must
have given similar results to my own. The fact that individuals can acquire the tall crest ontogenetically when placed in
the rich culture makes this a case of parallel induction.
