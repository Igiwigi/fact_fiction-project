based approach put forward in that work. The Hamiltonian of the one-dimensional Hubbard
model is

Here, ¢jo, dt « are fermionic operators satisfying the usual anticommutation relations, Nig =
dt ofjo, t>0 is the hopping parameter and U > 0 is the strength of the on-site repulsion. The
outline of this paper is as follows. In §2, we briefly recall necessary facts from the exact solution
of the Hubbard model. In §3, we consider typical states at finite temperature. In §§4 and 5, we
employ methods of integrability to show that it is possible to construct particular eigenstates at
finite energy densities for which the charge degrees of freedom do not contribute to the volume
term in the bipartite EE, corroborating the notion of the QDL diagnostic proposed in [33]. In §6,
we show that there exists a parametrically large regime in which thermal states support a weaker
version of QDL as proposed in [35].

2. Eigenstates of the Hubbard Hamiltonian

The Bethe ansatz method provides an exact solution of the one-dimensional Hubbard model [36].
Within the framework of the string hypothesis, eigenstates in the Hubbard model are determined
by solutions to Takahashi’s equations [36]. For a state with N electrons, M of which are spin-down,
