At the community scale, soils can also vary spatially along
the forest—savannah transition in fertility (e.g. organic matter,
cation exchange capacity, macronutrients), soil physical prop-
erties (e.g. percentage of sand), and soil depth, the latter two
factors combining to determine soil water availability. This
variation can limit tree seedling establishment [92] and deter-
mine different below-ground biomass allocation strategies [93]. However, despite the fact that soil fertility has long been recog-
nized to be lower in savannah soils, some studies suggest that
savannah soils are indeed low in nutrients on the topsoil, but
that deeper soil layers would have adequate nutrient stocks to
sustain forest [92]. This could perhaps explain the ability of
some woody species to establish in savannah soil, but given
the diverse species-specific nutrient-uptake strategies [94] this
deserves further investigation. The interaction of soil fertility with water availability and
soil water holding capacity can strongly influence forest—
savannah boundaries [43].
