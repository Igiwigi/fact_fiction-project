The principal stain employed was iron hematoxylin, counterstained with Van Giesen.

This staining method very clearly differentiates the cellular elements from the
red stained connective tissue. A specimen stained with Van Giesen stain alone

showed the characteristic yellow colour of the epithelial cells, the osteoblasts and
other connective tissue cells taking the red stain.

Apart from the very large amount of epithelium seen to be present in the coronal
part of the follicle, the first noticeable fact demonstrated by these preparations is,
that the Sheath of Hertwig is not a continuation downwards of the outer and inner
layers of the enamel organ. The remains of the enamel organ, which, after eruption,
form a portion of Nasmyth’s membrane, are seen attached to the follicle in many

places and in others partially detached from it, and projecting into the space
originally occupied by the enamel (fig. A). Near the junction of the connective tissue
of the follicle with the dentine the enamel organ is seen in contact with the wall
of the follicle and definitely terminates at the point where the enamel ceases
(figs. 5 and 8).
