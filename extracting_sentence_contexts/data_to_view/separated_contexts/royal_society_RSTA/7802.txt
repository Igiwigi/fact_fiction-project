Suggestions as
to how this may be possible with a substance normally arranged in a cubic lattice
will be made when the results are discussed. Particles showing this characteristic optical figure are of general occurrence as the
first stage of crystallization, both in silver and in gold films. The possible suggestion
that the birefringence is due to strain in the film, which has been freely invoked to
account for the electrical properties, is clearly disproved by the fact that they appear
in large numbers along any free edge of the film such as that bordering a scratch
made by a needle-point through the film, see figs. 7, af, Plate 14 . Further, as will
be shown later, they can be produced in densely packed masses by the heat-treatment
of a mercury amalgam, where the film can have no mechanical strength. They are
quite independent of the supporting surface, appearing in exactly the same way on
optical glass, quartz glass, and the natural crystal faces of diamond and mica.
