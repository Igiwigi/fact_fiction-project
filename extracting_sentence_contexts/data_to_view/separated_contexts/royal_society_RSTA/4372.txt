Although encouraging progress has been made in producing useful materials by harnessing
solar energy in the ways described above, the scale of the operation, so far, is so small as to be
almost infinitesimal in comparison with the amounts of materials, currently produced largely
from petrochemical refining. To maintain civilized life, with all its material necessities, a massive
increase is required in the scale of production. This fact has been elaborated elsewhere [36-38]. To
gauge the magnitude of what is now required of the ‘solar refinery’, I recall that there are some
400 petrochemical refineries in use worldwide at present. A modestly sized one processes 75 000
barrels of heavy oil in its fluidized catalytic cracking (FCC) bed.
