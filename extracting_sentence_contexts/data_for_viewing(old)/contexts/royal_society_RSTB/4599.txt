the observations of SNyDER (1913, p. 163), made on moulting larvze of North
American species of Leucotermes and on Termopsis angusticollis, Wallk., polymorphism
takes place during a moult and quiescent stage rather late in larval life. He states
that the larvee were, to all external appearances, undifferentiated previously. The
possibility, however, must be borne in mind that, notwithstanding the fact that the
larvee are hatched apparently alike, they may contain latent differences which do not
manifest their presence morphologically until later on in development. The recent
observations of BuGnton (1912, p. 1092; 1913, p. 213), suggest that in Hutermes
lacustris, Bugn., Termes redemanni, Wasm., 7. obscuriceps, Wasm., and 7. horn,
Wasm., differentiation into the soldier caste takes place during embryonic life, instead
of being subsequently developed from undifferentiated larvee. On hatching, the
castes can be definitely ascertained by the form of the head and mandibles. In
these instances it is obvious that food can have no influence on polymorphism. It is
extremely difficult to reconcile these observations with those of Grasst and SANDIAS,
who state that even far advanced larvze of winged forms may have their develop-
ment arrested and become converted into soldiers. On the other hand, HeatrH
(1902, p. 62), remarks with reference to Californian Termites : “ For months I have
