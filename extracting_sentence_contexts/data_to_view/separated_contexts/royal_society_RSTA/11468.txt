microscopic evidence shows that even the most delicate pyrometric methods which
have been applied in the present research are inadequate to detect the presence of the
first small proportions of eutectic ; in both serie8 of cylinders (B and C) small traces
of eutectic could be found in the sections of alloys containing as little as 10 per cent.
of tin. These small traces of eutectic, however, can be ascribed to the fact that the
cooling of the alloys had not been slow enough to allow complete equilibrium to be
established. The effect can be readily explained from a consideration of the process
of solidification â€˜of a solid solution as indicated in the diagram fig. 4. In this diagram
