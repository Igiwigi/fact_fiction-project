phenomena. But the later experiments with fragments of leaves show clearly
that the intumescences arise quite independently of root pressure. In the case of
HABERLAND?’S experiments with Conocephalus, I agree with CopELanp that the
water was excreted at the points where the normal organs had been cut off, because
those were the places of least resistance. ,

For the same reason the masses of new tissue, which, with Kiistpr and CopeLanp,

I regard as intumescences, were formed over the injured parts of the leaves. The
intumescences formed on the leafscars of potatoes when the leaves have fallen
off appear to be of a similar nature (p. 224). In the case of Lycopersicum, CopELAND
and Arkrnson find that the drops of water are excreted round the edges of the
leaves and not through the outgrowths—a fact which seems to me to show
conclusively that intumescences have no connection with root-pressure, and that
the internal causes must be sought in the assimilating cells of the parts affected.

In considering the contents of the assimilating cells we may first take the case
of the normal cells, especially those which have been most fully examined by the
present writer, viz., in Hibiscus vitifolins and Solanum tuberosum. It has been
shown that starch is abundantly formed in Hibiscus, particularly in plants grown
under conditions which promote the development of outgrowths. The Potato is
also a plant which produces large quantities of starch. According to PrerrER*
and Detmert{ carbohydrates give rise to organic acids, by oxidation or combustion.
These organic acids decompose nitrates,{ and, with the non-nitrogenous organic
materials resulting from carbon dioxide assimilation, proteids are formed. In this
