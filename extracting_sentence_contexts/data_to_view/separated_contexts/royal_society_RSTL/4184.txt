It is obseryaþble, moreover, that just at the point at which the con-
Etiguous passages meet each other, there is always a round aperture (ff, f") in the
Spartition (g, g) which divides the contiguous cells of each zone; and when, in a hori-
8zontal section, the superficial cells have been entirely ground away, 80 as to lay open
Sthe most superficial part of the intermediate stratum, this part is found to be trayersed
Zin each zone by a continuous circular canal (Plate VIII. fig. 3), with large rounded
Zopenings that lead into the columnar cells beneath. The meaning of this arrange-
Sment becomes obvious, when we examine the disposition of the animal substance
Ewhich occupies these cavities ; for we find, as might have been anticipated, that the
Asuperficial cells are filled with segments of sarcode of corresponding shape (Plate IV.
figs. 4,7, aa); and that whilst these have no direct connexion with one another,
each of them is connected by means of fleshy peduncles with the annular stolons
bb that run along its extremities ; whilst from the under side of these annular stolons
(fig. 4) descend the thick columns of sarcode (cc, cc), which occupy the columnar
cells of the intermediate stratum. The absence of any essential dependence of the
segments of the sperficial, and of those of the intermediate strata upon each other,
seems indicated by the fact that there is no constant numerical relation between
them,—a cireumstance which extremely perplexed me, until I had ascertained, by
examination of the animal, that the passages (Plate VI. fig. 7, e, e e") debouch, not
(as T had at first supposed) into the columnar cavities, but into the annular canal,

which serves to bring the snperficial and columnar segments of each zone into mutual
communication.

Surfaces, we may now proceed to the intermediate layer.
