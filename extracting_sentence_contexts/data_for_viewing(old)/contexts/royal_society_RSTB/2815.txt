when numerous more or less closely related one to another, and frequently synangial :
they are usually disposed in a circle round the periphery of a disc-like expansion at
the distal end of the sporangiophore, but other arrangements may be found. A vascular
strand runs usually through the stalk to the distal end, where it may divide into
branches which terminate in close relation with the sporangia. The position of the
sporangiophores may vary, being sometimes upon the axis (Calamostachys, Equisctum),
sometimes single, upon a leaf (Psilotacese) or more numerous (most Sphenophyllez,
and occasionally in Psilotaceze) along the margin of the spike ([elminthostachys), or
very numerous on the surface or margins of the leaf (Ferns). In all these cases the
main structural features of the sporangiophores are the same, and the question arises
whether these similar structures do not owe their origin to similar evolutionary
response to similar requirements, carried out in the various positions in which
we see them; it ts in fact suggested that the sporangiophores are simply placental
growths, and not the result of any “metamorphosis” of parts, or appendages of
prior existence.

The biological advantages gained by the formation of such placental growths are as
follows :—Indefinite increase of the simple sac is attended with practical disadvantages,
which would be met by sub-division of sporangia into separate pockets ; the difficulty
of dissemination from the sporangia thus produced would be met by their projection,
and still more fully by the separation of the sporangia, and is further helped when
the sporangia are lifted distinctly above the surface of the part which bears them ;
this is specially so in those cases where foliar or other appendages protect the sporangia
while young. But this raising of the sporangia upon an elongated stalk increases the
