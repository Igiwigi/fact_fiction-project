but we have never observed in the guinea-pig the practically permanent
loss of coagulability which the anaphylactic reaction produces in the dog’s blood. In
this respect, however, there is no obvious discrepancy between the effects of the
anaphylatoxins and the true anaphylactic reaction in the guinea-pig. We have
already mentioned the fact that the serum digested with chloroform has a very
different effect, causing widespread intravascular clotting. Leucocytes.—A leucopenia, affecting chiefly the polymorphonuclear cells, is
seen in guinea-pigs killed with any of the anaphylatoxins, as in those dying
of the true anaphylactic shock. There does not seem to be any great significance,
however, in this correspondence, since a quite similar leucopenia is seen in the
blood of guinea-pigs killed with histamine, and probably with many other
poisons.
