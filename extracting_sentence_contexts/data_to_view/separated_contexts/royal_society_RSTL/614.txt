Judging from all the operations of nature, of the causes of

which we are able to form any distinct ideas, we are certainly |
led to conclude, that the force of dead matter, (and perhaps of
living matter also,) or its power of affecting, that is to say, of |
moving, other matter, or of resisling its impulse, depends on its
motion. If, therefore, solid (or fluid) bodies have any powers whatever,
either of impulse or of resistance, it appears to me to be more
reasonable to ascribe them to the living forces residing in them,
—to the never-ceasing motions of their constituent particles, —
than to suppose them to be derived from their want of power,
and their total indifference to motion and to rest. No reasonable objection against this hypothesis, (of the in»
cessant motions of the constituent particles of all bodies,) founded
on a supposition that there is not room sufficient for these

motions, can be advanced; for we have abundant reason to
conclude, that if there be in fact any indivisible solid particles
of matter, (which however is very problematical,) these particles
must be 80 extremely small, compared to the spaces they occupy,
that there must be ample room for all kinds of motions among
them. And, whatever the nature or directions of these internal mo-
tions may be, among the constituent particles of a. solid body, as
long as these constituent particles, in their motions, do not
break loose from the systems to/ which they belong, (and to
which they are attached by gravitation,) and run wild in the
vast void by which each system is bounded, (which, as long as
the known laws of nature exist, is no doubt impossible,) the
form or external appearance of the'solid cannot be sensibly
changed by them. But, if the motions of the constituent particles of any solid
body be either increased or diminished, in consequence of the
actions, or radiations, of other distant bodies, this event could
not happen without producing some visible change in the solid
body.
