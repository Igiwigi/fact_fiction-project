- of ammonia could have been sustained, the more 80 that the experiments were made in
Swinter. Lastly, its specific gravity was taken at the standard temperature and found to

obe 1043:8. By assuming that the water undergoes no change in density, the specific
Zgravity of the liquid after its admixture with the water can be calculated, and proves
Sto be 1258'6 instead of 11916, its original specific gravity.
= When a solution of 12 parts of nitrate in 7 of water, which is an almost saturated
one at 15*5, is mixed with 5 times 12 or 60 parts of water, there is also a fall in tem-
Sperature of 4®, accompanied by condensation *: for before admixture the specific
-Sgravity of the primary solution is 1298-7, while afterwards its specific gravity,
-Scalculated from that of the mixture, 1064-4, is 1336 ; whence it will be seen that the
Scontraction in volume, though very considerable, is not so great as that experienced by
=the ammonia solution of the nitrate, as might indeed be anticipated from the fact that
>the calculated densities of the nitrate and the liquefied ammonia are both less than their
Zdensities in aqueous solution.
> When the liquid (No. 1 in the preceding Tables) containing the least proportion of
Snitrate, namely two thirds of its weight, was mixed with water in the proportion (for the
Svake of comparison) of five parts to one of the nitrate, the temperature was found to fall
only about 4*. The admixture was effected as before, except that on removing the
Stopper the liquid was in this case violently expelled from the flask into the water by
Z80me ammonia becoming gaseous, and that then the water rose into the flask by absorbing
Ethis gas. The specific gravity of the mixture was found to be 1026-4, and from this
=Swas calculated that of the liquid after its admixture with water. Instead of its original
Eapooifio gravity, which was 1072-5, it had in the mixture that of 11258. Compounds
Qof the nitrate with ammonia in other proportions were als» mixed with water, and
