parts.

A notable feature is the tetrarch instead of the usual pentarch steles of two of
the stems. In all the bifurcating stems also the resulting steles are 4-angular ;
the presumption is that the two separate stems with 4-angular steles are recent
products of dichotomy, although they may not be sister axes. This tetrarch
condition persists for a considerable distance upwards before giving place to the
typical 5-angled form (see text-fig. 9, stem No. 6). Associated with each
dichotomy is an inevitable disturbance of the normal 2/5 phyllotaxis ; this is,
however, restored higher up, though very gradually. This and other questions
relating to the phyllotaxis will be discussed at a later stage.

Another remarkable fact is the extremely small angle of divergence in the
bifureating stem. This is clearly indicated by the serial sections drawn in

text-fig. 9; the sister axes lie almost parallel to each other, that is, practically
vertical, like the parent stem. ‘These are facts of importance in a reconstruction
of the plant, and are more fully considered below.
