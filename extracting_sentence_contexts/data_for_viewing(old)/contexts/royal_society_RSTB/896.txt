SThe connection of the process with the condition of the liver cells favours the view
{Bat the activity of the cells is the agent causing the amylolysis.
EThe influence of temperature and of fluoride of sodium, the increased amylolysis
wider chloroform, ether, and pyrogallic acid which accelerate the katabolie changes
B the liver cells, and the absence of increased amylolysis with morphin, curare, nitrite
amyl, and salicylate of soda, seem to point to intra-cellular changes being the
portant factor in this early period.
spFinally, the direct production of glucose, without intermedial bodies, marks off the
@hanges at this period from those oceurring later.
This early change in the excised liver is simply a continuation of the vital process
ยง the organ, though the katabolic side of the metabolism is exaggerated, and the
guabolic in abeyance.
In fact, all the evidence is in favour of the view that the conversion of glycogen to
lucose is precisely the same as the conversion of mucinogen to mucin or of zymogens to
Symin. And there is no more reason to invoke the agency of a ferment in the eaplan-
Bon of the former than of the latter processes.
