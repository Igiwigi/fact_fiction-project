Plaster models such as we have used in this study have many advantages over wax ones ; they are more
enduring, and can be readily reproduced. To obtain a plaster model is, however, by no means an easy
problem ; the obvious solution would seem to be to cast from a wax one, but if the latter be at all
complicated, this is a task which even an expert will not undertake. The only way is to build up the
plaster model in successive sheets, a method which is rendered possible by the fact that plaster cast upon
freshly-set plaster will adhere to it. The steps in the process are as follows :â€”Tracings of the photographed
sections are first made on transparent paper, and round each a rectangle is drawn to provide for exact
registration. Sheets of wax are prepared of uniform thickness ; placing one of these over a tracing the
outline of the section is cut out with a fine pointed scalpel and the sides of the sheet are cut to correspond
with the surrounding rectangle.
