These F series further show the existence of satellitesâ€”in other words the
Jf sequence is also subject to slight collateral displacements. This renders their
disentanglement a very intricate problem not only in itself, but because it renders
the region of the spectrum involved very crowded, with lines close together, with the
consequence that coincidences occur which may not refer to real relationship. In fact
there are cases where the calculated values of supposed lines of different series are the
same within observation errors.* This crowding is also increased by the existence of
the allied F series referred to above. The complete discussion of all these related
series should afford valuable material for arriving at a knowledge of displacement
laws. Here it will be sufficient to indicate the nature of the problem and to deal
with the material so far as to give confidence in the results as to the assignment of
series and especially as to accurate determinations of the oun and the various links.
