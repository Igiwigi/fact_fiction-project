communication with the ring of resin canals at the inner edge of the secondary wood,
the cells of which canals show a large number of threads arranged in the usual manner.

The Phloem.—The phloem of Pinus sylvestris, which is figured in the various works
of STRASBURGER,” is made up of sieve tubes and of cambiform or bast-parenchyma
cells. The albuminous cells, which usually accompany the medullary rays, may also
be conveniently described with the phloem.

A study of the distribution of the connecting threads in the phloem and in the
medullary-ray cells associated with it, brings out the striking fact that the sieve
tubes never communicate directly, either with the cells of the bast-parenchyma, or
with the starch-containing cells of the medullary ray, and that the following rela-
tions exist, namely, that the sieve tubes are connected with the albuminous cells and
the bast-parenchyma with the starch cells of the medullary ray. Both these latter
are, however, connected with the albuminous cells, the starch cells freely and the
bast-parenchyma to a much less degree, and from this it follows that the albuminous
cells perform the important function of affording the only means of communication,
and this an indirect one, between the sieve tubes and the rest of the parenchy-
matous tissues which compose the bast and medullary rays.

In a transverse section the absence of any connection between the starch-contain-
ing medullary-ray cells and the sieve tubes is at once apparent (fig. 24, Plate 34) ;
