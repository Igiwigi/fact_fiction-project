integration is extended s0 as to include the whole attracting mass ſgdw; and the integral
is then said to represent the Prepotential of the mass in regard to the point (& .. c, e).
In the particular case 8=2, q=—4}, the force is as the inverse square of the distance, ,
and the integral represents the Potential in the ordinary sense of the word.

'The element of volume dw is usually either the element of solid (spatial or (s+1)-
dimensional) volume dz.. dz dw, or else the element of superficial (s-dimensional)
volume dS. In particular, when the surface (s-dimensional locus) is the (s-dimensional)
plane w=0, the superficial element dS is=dz... dz. The cases of a less-than-s-dimen-
Sional yolume are in the present memoir considered only incidentally. It is scarcely
necessary to remark that the notion of density is dependent on the dimensionality of the
element of volume dw: in passing from a spatial distribution, g dx . . . dz dw, to a snper-
ficial distribution, g dS, we alter the signification of g. In fact if, in order to connect
the two, we imagine the spatial distribution as made over an indefinitely thin layer or
stratum bounded by the surface, 80 that at any element dS of the surface the normal
thickness is dy, where dy is a function of the coordinates (7... 2, w) of the element 45,
the spatial element is =d» dS, and the element of mass g dz. . . dz dw is =g d» dS; and

then changing the signification of g, 80 as to denote by it the product g dv, the expression
for the element of mass becomes g dS, which is the formula in the case of the superficial
