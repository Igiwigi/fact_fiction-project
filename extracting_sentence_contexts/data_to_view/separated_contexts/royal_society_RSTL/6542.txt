This conclusion agrees with that expressed by Principal
Forts in the: last of the preceding extracts; but: the reason assigned is very different. The absence of great fluid pressure within: the: glacier in snch case is not- due to: the
absence of capillarity, but to the particular condition of its duets and crevices being open
in every part, of the bounding surface of the mass: There caw be no expenditure of vis
vive in producing pressure on a Mooth: surface, as is/ well known, though: such pressure
must necessarily be produced in the case before us, as/in all cases of constrained motion
when the constraint is produced by the action of uct surfaces. The fact-of no vis'viva
being lost does not imply that no internal pressure would be produced:
