EVOLUTION, AND ORIGIN OF THE AMPHIBIA. 57

In Bothriceps the hypoglossal foramen is on the outer side of the exoccipital
condyle, as in Capitosaurus ; in Batrachosuchus it is in the middle of the posterior
surface of the bone, as in C. stantonensis ; whilst in Plagiosaurus it has disappeared
altogether, as in the typical Cyclotosauri.

It is possible to give a plausible mechanical explanation of one of this series of
changesâ€”the gradual travelling forward of the quadrate condyles.

T have called attention to the fact that the large Amphibia show a progressive
flattening of the head and anterior part of the body; such an animal as Mastodon-
saurus, with an enormous flat head and very small limbs, must have lived in ponds or
rivers, lying flat on the bottom and being practically incapable of raising its head off
the ground.

Its only possible method of opening its mouth was to raise the head, leaving the
lower jaw on the ground, very much as a crocodile does. If the articulation of the
head and neck lies in advance of that of skull and lower jaw, such a method of
opening the mouth involves raising the whole anterior end of the body to an extent
depending directly on the amount of the projection of the quadrate condyle behind
the skull-neck joint.
