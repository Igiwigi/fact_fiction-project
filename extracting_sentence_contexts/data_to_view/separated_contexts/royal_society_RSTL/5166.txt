A quantity of material similar to the last, obtained on a different occasion, was
treated in the same way with boiling alum liquor, and the deposit formed on the
liquor cooling was submitted to analysis, It had a much lighter colour than the
preceding, and when dissolved in alcohol, the latter left on evaporation crystals,
apparently of alizarine, mingled with red crystalline masses resembling impure
alizarine.

These two specimens therefore of a substance prepared in the same way, both of
which would, according to the definition of WoLFry and STRECKER, pass for purpurine,
possessed a composition, which in the one case corresponded to a mixture of 1 equiy.
of alizarine and 3 equirs. of verantine, in the other case to a mixture of 3 equivs. of
alizarine and 1 equiy, of verantine. A till more manifest proof of the fact of purpurine
not being a substance of uniform composition, is derived from an examination of the
liquid from which these specimens were deposited. To the bright red liquid from
which the last was deposited, I added after filtration muriatic acid and boiled. A
yellow precipitate was produced, which was collected on a filter and washed.
