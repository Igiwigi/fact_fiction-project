Masson gives experimental proof of this for the case of a solution of copper chloride
following potassium chloride. The stability of such a margin is dependent on the relation between the velocity ot
the following and the preceding ions. The fact that the boundary between certain
pairs of solutions was stable when the current moved in one direction, but showed
signs of mixing when sent in the opposite direction, was first explained by
WuertHam (‘ Phil, Trans.,’ A, 1893, p. 337). Some of the phenomena at the junction of two solutions had been previously
obseryed by Gore (‘ Roy, Soe. Proc.,’ 1880-1881), but were not looked at from the
present standpoint.
