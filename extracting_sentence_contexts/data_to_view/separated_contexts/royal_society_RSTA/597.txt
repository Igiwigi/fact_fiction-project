The original plateau was about 50m. above
sea-level, and the diameter of the crater is about 100m. Thus the volume is about 1-3 x
10" cm.3, making M = 3x 10!'g. An upper limit to the velocity imparted to the rock can be obtained from the fact that
nearly all of it fell within 100 m. of the centre of the crater, and the lower limit from the fact
that a large amount was able to clear the rim. Taking 50m. as an estimate of the average
height attained gives W’ = 1-5 x 10!8 ergs. The total thermal energy in the main charge group was about 1:3 x 107° ergs, or roughly
100 times that required to produce the crater.
