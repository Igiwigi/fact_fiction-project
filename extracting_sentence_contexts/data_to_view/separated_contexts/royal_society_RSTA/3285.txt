The Extraneous Relations.—Nothing could be more beautiful than the above issue
of the classical concept, if only we limit ourselves to the consideration of an
unchanging world of space. Unfortunately, it is a changing world to which the
complete concept must apply, and the intrusion at this stage into the classical concept
of the necessity of providing for change can only spoil a harmonious and complete
whole. Owing to the fact that the instants of time are not members of the field of
the essential relation, the time relation and the essential relation have (so to speak)
no point of contact. To remedy this, another subdivision of the class of objective
reals is conceived, namely, the class of particles (where the particles are the ultimate
entities composing the fundamental “stuff” which moves in space). These particles
must form part of the fields of a class of extraneous relations.
