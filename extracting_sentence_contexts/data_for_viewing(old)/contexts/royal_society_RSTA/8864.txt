hypothecated by various writers; this shows that the values of ¢, taken are appropriate
ones. LinpDBLAD, for example, reduces his spectral curve calculated for 6720° by
the factor 0-74, in order to get coincidence with the observed curve at 26000; the

same applies to the suggestion of Ansor and others that the steepness of the red side
of the energy curve implies a temperature of the order of 7000°, for, drawn on an
absolute scale, the curve for 7000° towers formidably above the observed curve. Now
the fact of the observed darkening following the computed law in the neighbourhood
of 26000 is compatible with the scattering theory; but in the violet, where the
depression* is very much greater than is given by a factor 0-74, much greater values
of «, would be required, and discrepancies incomparably larger than the existing ones
should occur, in the direction of reducing the darkening towards u = 0-6.

The conclusion is that the darkening on the solar disc shows no evidence of the
existence of a purely scattering atmosphere above the radiating material.

Note.—It is difficult to make direct estimates of the coefficients of scattering in the
solar atmosphere, but as far as the numerical results go they confirm the negligible
importance of scattering (see e.g. LINDBLAD, loc. cit., p. 21) ; the densities are too small.}
But this is not to deny the probability of scattering playing an important part in other
