For this reason, we do not provide here all the details, but we point out which are the main
differences. First of all, we observe that all the solutions are globally defined. In fact, h, g have at most linear
growth at infinity, namely, there are constants which bound |h(t,s)|/|s| and |g(s)|/|s| for |s| large. Next, we note that for each ¢ > 0, there is a constant M; > 0 such that, for all t € [0, T],

S(X)H(E) < Goo + €)x()* +Me, H(t, yD) y(t) < (loo + €)y(t)” + Me. (3.7)
Using again the modified rotation number as in (3.4), we find the following inequality

P_[P AG(t)(go0 + €)x(L? + (Itoo + 8)y(t? Rot? (zo; [a, B]) < my I, xO? + pyr

Now, for any positive integer k, let us take

Then, for every 0 <A <A(k,q) we can find a sufficiently small ¢ > 0 and a corresponding large
radius R > 0 (depending on 4 and e), such that for any solution satisfying

x(t)? + py(t? >R, Vvte le, Bl, (3.10)
it follows that

Rot? ((x(0), y(0)); [a, B]) < ve (« + e)(loo + €) sup a) (B—a)+e<k.

In this case, the suitable choice of p is given by

and R is chosen to make the second term appearing in the sum (3.8) less than ¢.
