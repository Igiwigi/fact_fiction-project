The experiment acquires considerable interest, due to the fact that there are marked
similarities between the high-rotation régime and observed flows of the earth’s atmosphere. In the present paper only the symmetrical forced flow will be discussed. It is convenient
first of all to deal with the problem of zero rotation in order to establish a method of attack
which exploits the fact that the fluid is shallow. We consider next the forced motion when
the dishpan rotates, in order to obtain the essential mechanism of the low-rotation régime. This is first done approximately by omitting all the non-linear terms.
