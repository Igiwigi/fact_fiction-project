In the experiment this took place
in five days. The white sediment was first observed, in both instances,
about the twelfth day ; it continued to be deposited till the
patient got well, and to the end of the experiment. That the blood is capable of uniting with a quantity of urine
equal to itself, $0 as to form a firm coagulum ; that the red
globules do not dissolve in a coagulum $0 formed ; that an ad-
mixture of urine prevents the blood from becoming putrid ;


when extravasated into the urinary Bladder. 493

and that the coagulating lymph breaks down into parts almost
resembling a soſt powder, are facts which I believe to be new ;
—they may, however, have been before ascertained, although
I have not been acquainted with them. They are certainly not generally known, and one object of
the present paper is to communicate them to others. These facts, considered abstractedly, may not appear of
much importance ; but when compared with what takes place
in the living body, and found to agree with the process the
blood undergoes in the urinary bladder, they become of no
small value, since they enable us to account for the symptoms
that occur in that disease, and lead to the most simple and ef-
fectual mode of relieving them.
