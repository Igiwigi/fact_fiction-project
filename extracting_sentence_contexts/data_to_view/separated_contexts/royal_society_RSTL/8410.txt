N. MOSELEY ON THE ANATOMY AND

clusion that the curiously and often spirally contorted appearance of these parent cells
was merely due to the action of spirit on a highly elastic investing membrane, and the
bodies shown in fig. 8 were merely d6bris of such a membrane. In Rhynchodemus these
cells may often be observed uncontracted and of an oval form, and containing two or
three rod-like bodies (Plate XI. fig. 2), in fact in every way resembling the rod-cells
described from ordinary aquatic Planarians. On treatment with potash, the cells of
Bipalium swell up (Plate XI. fig. 4), are seen to contain rod-like bodies, and the fine
filament at the upper extremity appears like a duct leading to the surface of the base-
ment membrane. In sections of the integument taken parallel to the surface, the parent,
cells of the rod-like bodies are seen to occupy positions opposite the interval between
the stout external longitudinal muscular fibres (Plate XI. fig. 5); and when cut
through transversely (Plate X. fig. 11), they prove to be divided into two or three com-
partments, and to be provided with a very stout horny-looking cell-wall.
