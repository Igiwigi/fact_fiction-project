if the view of RosenHarIn and ArcuBurr were to be definitely established, it would
be necessary to regard it, not as a theory of season cracking in terms of the known
properties of materials, but as a deduction of the properties of the intercrystalline
layers from the phenomena of season cracking. Looked at in this way, it would be
of extreme interest, for it would show that the molecular arrangement of the inter-
crystalline layers could not be of the coarse-grained type characteristic of the normal
states of solids and liquids.

It is clear that the foregoing theory of liquids is not free from objection, and that in
some respects it appears to be less satisfactory than existing theories. The most
obvious objection is that it seems to be incompatible with accepted determination of
the molecular weight of liquids. Since, however, these experiments are based ultimately
on kinetic considerations, the author believes that this difficulty will not in fact arise
unless the requisite bonds between the molecules of each group are found to be sufficiently
strong to cause appreciable modification of the average molecular kinetic energy.

12. Summary of Conclusions.

(1) The ordinary hypothesis of rupture cannot be employed to predict the safe range
of alternating stress which can be applied to metal having a scratched surface. The
safe range of an unscratched test piece appears to be slightly less than the yield range,
but if the surface is scratched the safe range may be several times the range which
causes yield in the corners of the scratches.

(2) The “ theorem of minimum potential energy ” may be extended so as to be capable
