Consequently,
while it is believed that the results are correct, it is not shown that the conditions to be
fulfilled have specified a unique arrangement. The probability of a pair of lines falling
accidentally in the place where series lines are to be expected exists, but the possibility
of a wrong identification is very much diminished by correlating all the spectra in the
manner described and by confining attention to the stronger lines. The principal
doublets are scarcely open to doubt, and the diffuse doublets and satellites are in almost
as strong a position, The 2p—2s linesare usually weak, and lie in a portion of the spectrum
not very accurately measurable, but it was rarely that any alternative pairs were
found, and in those spectra where no definite choice between pairs of lines complying

equally well with the tests available could be made, no lines have been placed in the
tables, or the fact has been indicated. The fundamental lines seem satisfactory on the whole; they are strong lines and not
difficult to pick out. There is some uncertainty about the satellites, but the 4f —5g pair
when it can be found strengthens the identification made.
