tial for induced contraction that the nerve of the galvanoscopic frog should give signs of
muscular current at the moment in which it is laid on the thigh. The internal part of
a muscle may also be used for obtaining this phenomenon; this is done by immerging
the nerve of the galyanoscopic frog in a longitudinal wound made in a muscle. From
this we may infer that a phenomenon of the same kind as that of induced contraction
takes place on a whole living animal, when an electrical current makes one of the mus-
cular masses of the upper part of a limb contract: although it may be admitted that the
neryous filaments concealed in that mass, and which pass through it as they branch
towards the inferior muscles, are not traversed by the current on account of their low
conducting power, yet at the moment in which the superior muscles contract, the lower
ones contract also. This fact, of which I treated in the Eighth Series of my Researches*,
appears to be thus traced up to its true cause, namely, that it is a natural and perhaps
physiological case of induced contraction.

I shall add, finally, that when a stratum, however thin, of a good conducting body, or
a like stratum of a solid isolating body, is interposed between the muscles in contraction
and the. nerve of the galvanoscopic frog, no induced contraction is obtained, as may be
verified with gold-leaf or an extremely thin lamina of mica; on the contrary, with a
piece of wet paper, and als with an excessively thin stratum of liquid turpentine, the
phenomenon continues to manifest itself.

The many fruitless efforts which I made, and even the contradictory results at which I
arrived, m endeavouring to determine the cause of induced contraction by means of the
