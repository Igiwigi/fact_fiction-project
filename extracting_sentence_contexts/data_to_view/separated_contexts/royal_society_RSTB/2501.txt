Boopie has decribed several species of Schizea which
practically differ from each other only in the more or less complete sclerification of
the pith. Unfortunately the anatomy of the species of Schizea at present described
does not offer any series of gradations such as is presented by the American species
of Osmunda; hence, it is impossible to discuss by reference to this genus alone the
mode of origin of the medullated central cylinder, or its possible relationship to the
types presented by the stem of Lygodiwm on the one hand, and those of Anemia and
MohriÂ« on the other. More facts are urgently needed which may or may not be
supplied when we are thoroughly acquainted with the anatomy of all the living
species of the Schizea. Boonie follows Zenerrr (op. cit.)
