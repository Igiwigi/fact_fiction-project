and from the use of H isotopes for a better characterization of the role of recombination poisons
on the different steps associated with H cathodic discharge on a metal surface.

(b) Hydrogen absorption in nickel base alloys in pressurized water reactor conditions

The prediction and prevention of the intergranular stress corrosion cracking (IGSCC) of nickel
base alloys in the primary media of pressurized water reactors (PWRs) is a major concern for the
safe operation of these reactors. However, in spite of numerous studies conducted on this subject
during the last decades, the mechanism responsible for IGSCC of alloy 600 in PWR environment
is still discussed [20]. Until very recently, a possible role of hydrogen in IGSCC occurring in
primary water at 300-350°C was discarded as this temperature range was considered to be too
high to provide hydrogen embrittlement effects. Indeed, according to current values proposed
for H-defects binding energies (about 0.2-0.8 eV), and besides the fact that detrapping energies
