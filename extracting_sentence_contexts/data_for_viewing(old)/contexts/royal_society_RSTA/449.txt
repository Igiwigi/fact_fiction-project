to a resonance behaviour in modes {I, III, V}, while table 2 shows that for De =0 only mode III
displays a well-formed power peak.

The power shows a single peak at high dimensionless frequency, and the elastic energy shows
a single sharp peak profile.

(a) Fluid power dissipation and membrane energy storage

Figure 10 shows the power dissipation P(®) as a function of the dimensionless frequency @
for the modes {I, III, V}, with inertia De £0 (figure 10a) and without inertia De =0 (figure 10b).
Inertia generates well-localized resonant peaks in the three modes (I, II, II). Inertialess conditions
generate a broader power peak only in mode III (large viscosity) since dissipative modes persist
with higher frequencies. These facts follow from the fact that the power is proportional to the
imaginary part of the transfer function P() = Im[Fp(@)]|/2 (see equation (4.9)) and according
to the asymptotic results of appendix C, only under finite inertia Im[Fp(@)] converges at large
frequency to its static value. Hence, except for mode III, inertialess conditions do not generate
power pulses.
