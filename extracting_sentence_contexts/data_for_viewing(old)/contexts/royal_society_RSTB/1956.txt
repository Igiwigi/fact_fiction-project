nuclear division is of interest, when it is remembered that much the same conditions
prevail in some of the other plants. Thus, when the spore mother cell of the liver-
wort Fossombronia* is about to divide, a simultaneous appearance of four centrospheres
occurs, and, in the middle of the radiation-systems, centrosomes can be readily seen.
And yet there is no evidence that these structures have been formed otherwise than
at the spots at which they are first seen—certuinly there is nothing to lead one to
suppose that the four centrospheres have arisen by the bipartition of one original
y- And furthermore, in the germinating spore of Pellia epiphylla the centro-
Sspheres, together with their inclusions, fade away during the protracted period of
frelative inactivity so characteristic of the equatorial plate stage in the karyokinensis
Bt this plant.
ES But that a great range of variety in the mode of behaviour of these bodies prevails
gn the lower plants is shown by the fact that, according to Swinaxx,t the centrosomes
themselves persist in the intervals of rest between two successive nuclear divisions
Sn Sphacelaria, and thus we meet with a series of gradations extending from a
‘Zelatively permanent centrosome to one which is periodically renewed, or formed
afresh, at each period of nuclear division.
8, SrrRAsBuRGER states that in some of his own preparations he was able to trace an
‘ipparent connection between the position of the two centrospheres and the limits of
che portion of the oospore nucleus which belonged to the sperm, and he suggests that
‘Sthis may be explained as the result of an importation, in an unrecognisable condition,
fof a centrosome by the sperm. Such an interpretation is tempting, in view of the
Statements put forward in connection with the first segmentation of animal eggs, but
Sits foundation is weakened in Fucus by the fact that there is, as has been said, no
Svisible centrosome brought in by the sperm, and also by the irregularity. of its mode
