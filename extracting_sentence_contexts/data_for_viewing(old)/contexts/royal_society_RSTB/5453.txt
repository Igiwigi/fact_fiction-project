regarded the processus ascendens as homologous with the ala temporalis, as do Fucus
(1912), Gregory and Noswx (1924). In Trichosurus (and also in Perameles, as shown
by Corps, 1915, and Espatin, 1916) the cartilaginous ala temporalis is perforated by
a foramen rotundum for V 2; the cartilage in front of this foramen can be regarded as
processus ascendens, and that behind it as true ala temporalis. In further support of

the view that the ala temporalis is the (slightly modified) processus ascendens, is-the
fact that in a great many mammals, it chondrifies separately from the processus alaris.
The following is a list of the forms in which the ala temporalis has been seen to arise
separately, or in which its attachment to the processus alaris shows a suture :â€”
