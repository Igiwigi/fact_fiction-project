"When a leaf is assimilating at the rate of 1°8 grammes of carbohydrate per square
metre of leaf surface per hour, the greatest amount which has hitherto been recorded
for Helianthus annuus by the weighing method of Sacus, it does not require a greater
intake of carbon dioxide than ‘134 cub. centim. per square centim. per hour ; that is
to say, only from 5:2 to 6°3 per cent. of the maximum amount which the diffusion
apparatus of the leaf would be capable of effecting if the interior of the leaf were a
perfect “ sink” of atmospheric carbon dioxide.

The great difference between the observed intake of CO, and the maximum
possible intake deduced from a consideration of the physical mechanism of the leaf
is of course due to the fact that the pressure of the gas in the respiratory cavity and
interspaces is still considerable, even during active assimilation, so that there is only
a very small gradient between the external and internal gas, due to the imperfection
of the absorption.*

From the data already given it is possible to deduce the average pressure of the
carbon dioxide in the interior of the assimilating leaf when that of the outer air is
known. Under like conditions the rate of intake will depend on the magnitude
p — p), where p and p, represent the pressures of the carbon dioxide in the outer air
and in the intercellular spaces respectively.

When p,; = 0 we have seen that the intake may amount to 2°578 cub. centims. per
square centim. per hour when the outer air is in motion, and 2°095 cub. centim. when
