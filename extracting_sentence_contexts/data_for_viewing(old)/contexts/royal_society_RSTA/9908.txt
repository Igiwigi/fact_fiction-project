an additional arbitrary constant, produce a formula capable of reproducing spectral
series with greater accuracy. The criteria justifying the form of a new term should
be a very considerable increase of accuracy over a wide range (and particularly for
m = 1), and that it should bring to light further relationships. Rurz,* from certain
theoretical ideas, has taken D = m+p+8/m? or m+p+f/(m+°5)’, and with a large
number of series has obtained very close agreement. It was not until T had made
some progress with this work that I became acquainted with his paper. I believe
this to have been fortunate, for had I known his work, and the great increase of
accuracy obtained by his forms, I should probably not have attempted to essay any
further improvement. As it was I had proceeded so far as to feel certain that T was
on correct lines, and had already obtained even more accurate results than his,
besides some of the relationships presented below. The first important result was
that it was rarely necessary to go beyond the e/m term—in fact, not at all for the
alkali metals—that if «, 8 were both included, and, of course, an additional line used
for calculation, 8 always came out a small fraction of «, and that with « alone the
agreement was much better than with 8 alone (Rrrz). Evidence of this is given
below.

As will be seen later, there are indications that a form D = m+p+e/(m+a) may
be the true form, at least for certain series. These indications will be mentioned in
due course, but as the metals of Group II. are not discussed in the present communi-
cation, the case may be further illustrated from a special series in Mg, which will at
the same time serve to show that too much stress must not be laid in favour of a
particular formula on the mere fact that it reproduces the observed lines, unless the
observations are very exact, or comprise the first members and a considerable number
