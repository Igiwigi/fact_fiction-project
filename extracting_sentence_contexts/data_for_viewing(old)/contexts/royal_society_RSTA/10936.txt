Thus on an average there were four seed vessels to a plant. The mean and standard
deviation found directly from the capsules are 7°5101 and 1:4559 respectively.
These are in substantial agreement with the above results found for pairs. They do
not confirm the conclusion based upon the data for poppies, namely that if we work —
with pairs we shall raise the mean and lower the variability. The fact is that vigour
seems to work in opposite directions with this plant and the poppy ; with the latter
it means many capsules with a high number of stigmatic bands, but with the former
it means many side shoots with the differentiated capsules with few segmentations.
Such capsules of course decrease the mean and raise the variability.

The coefficient of variation is 19°385, sensibly greater than that of the wild poppy,
but below that of the holly leaf. The standard deviation of an array is 1°4622, or
the variability of the individual 98°18 per cent. of that of the race. The plant with
the greatest number of seed vessels on had only 11, and these gave a standard
deviation of 1°6188, greater than that of the whole race! But of course this is subject
to a very large probable error ; it suffices to emphasise, however, how the source of
