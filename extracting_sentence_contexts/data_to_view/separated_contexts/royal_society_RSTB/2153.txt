The terminal positive deflection at break
of light is abolished, After the second tetanisation the positive response is further augmented. Augmentation of the positive response to light is the principal and typical after-
effect of tetanisation of the retina. Many points of inquiry arise from this principal
fact. What are the effects upon the response to light during tetanisation ? What
are the effects during and after tetanisation upon a retinal response of the third
stage ?
