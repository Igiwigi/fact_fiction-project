Furthermore, in my experi-
ments a dark red surface did not produce reddish, but dark, pupz in P. brassice, and
(as will be shown below) I can quite confirm Mr. Bonn’s criticism that reddish pup
of P. rape are not found on red brick walls. At the same time Mr. Bonn’s objection
to the main position taken up by Mr. Woop—that the pupe of Pieride have some
general resemblance with their surroundings—is without sufficient foundation, and
the fact must now be generally admitted. His criticism that he has seen pupae of
P. rape with all shades of colour on the white painted woodwork of a greenhouse is
valueless unless he can show that the dark forms are as common as when the pupe
are found on a tarred fence. Mr. Bonp’s obsérvation that the variable pupe of
Anthocaris cardamines are not sensitive is important, but the species needs experi-
mental investigation in order to confirm his observations.
