414 SIR F. DARWIN ON THE RELATION BETWEEN

of the stomata in darkness and their re-opening in light; the effect of withering,
i.e. the preliminary opening of the stomata followed by closure, ete. The problem
which forms the subject of the present paper, @.e. the relation between stomata and
transpiration, is but briefly illustrated in the paper. Only a single experiment was
given to show the parallelism which occurs between the variations in aperture of the
stomata and in the rate of transpiration. In the present essay I hope to establish
the fact that this parallelism holds good within certain limits. There are, indeed,
frequent irregularities in the experiments, as disturbing causes cannot be avoided ;
but when the general correspondence between the results of a large number of .
experiments is considered, it seems to me impossible to accept Luoyn’s dictum* with
regard to stomata—that “ their regulatory function is almost ni/.” It must in justice
be said that he elsewhere modifies this sweeping assertion. He allows (p. 35) that
“complete closure of the stomata, if this occurs, reduces transpiration to, or nearly to,
cuticular rate.” He also grants that the stomata give the upper limit of transpira-
tion; that is to say, when the stomata are open to their utmost limit the highest
rate of transpiration under these conditions is the maximum of which the leaf is
capable. Anyone who has been familiar, as I have, with the general parallelism in
the curves of transpiration and stomatal aperture in obedience to changing conditions
cannot possibly give in to what must be called the illogical position just referred to,
