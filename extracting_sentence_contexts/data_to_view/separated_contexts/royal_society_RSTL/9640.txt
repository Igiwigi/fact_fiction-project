As the exhaustion approaches the tension of aqueous vapour,
evaporation goes on at a greater rate, and the vapour displaces the air with increasing
rapidity ; until, after the pressure of 12'7 millims. is passed, the aqueous vapour acts
as a gas, and, being constantly snpplied from the reservoir of water (as long as it
lasts), washes out all the air from the apparatus, the logarithmic decrement rapidly
sinking to that of pure water gas. This explanation requires bhat the viscosity of pure aqueous vapour should be the
same as that of hydrogen, at all events between 7 millims. and 1 millim. pressure. The facts can, however, be explained in another way. During the action of the
SPRENGEL pump sufficient electricity is 80metimes generated to render the fall tubes
Inminous in the dark (52). Tt is conceivable that under 8uch electrical influence
the falling mercury may be able to decompose aqueous vapour at these high exhaustions,
with formation of oxide of mercury and liberation of hydrogen.
