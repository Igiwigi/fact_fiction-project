The mixed-strategy equilibrium predictions we developed
for games of attack and defence between unitary agents, such
as individuals, generalize to intergroup games of attack and
defence [42,89]. Experiments confirmed that also individuals
nested in groups invest, on average, less in attack than in

defence and that the probability of winning the political
conflict in intergroup conflict also is approximately 30%
[42,82,89,98]. At the same time, we have shown too that
within-group cooperation and coordination of collective
action become critical to winning, or not losing, the
intergroup game of attack and defence [42,89]. In fact,
groups seeking change through attack have more difficulty
coordinating effective collective action, and face a stronger
‘free-rider’ problem than groups trying to defend the status
quo [82,89,98]. Vice versa, groups defending the status quo
elicit stronger group-identification and commitment among
their members than groups attacking the status quo [42,82].

An implication of these findings is that political groups
seeking to create change (versus those defending against it)
benefit more from institutions such as leadership and com-
munication channels that increase commitment and facilitate
the coordination of collective action [42,99]. An interesting
