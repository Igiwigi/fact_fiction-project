Ws I recollect the many learned men who have given this
lecture, I cannot but feel myself much flattered by the honour
of being named to that office ; I feel, at the same time, my own
inability to explain many of the phenomena of muscular mo-
tion ; yet more its principle, the subject to which this lecture
was originally confined. The many, and perhaps insuperable, difficulties which ob-
struct our progress towards that knowledge, have led the ablest
anatomists and physiologists, who have been called upon by
this learned Society for their observations upon muscular mo-
tion, to deviate from the original intention of the founder, and
instead of attempting an investigation of the principle, to ex-
plain the anatomical structure, and various phenomena of
muscles with which they were acquainted ; that by this means
they might furnish data for future inquiries. I $hall consider the example of such men as sufficient au-
thority for not confining myself too closely to the subject pre-
scribed ; and content myself with giving such facts and obser-
vations respecting muscles, as have not, I believe, been already
laid before this learned Society. This lecture was given for several years by Mr. HUNTER,
