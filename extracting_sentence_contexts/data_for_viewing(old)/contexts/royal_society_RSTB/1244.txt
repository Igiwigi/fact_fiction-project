ney of their appearance, and the correlation of smaller size and greater
sity of external form of the synangium with the imperfect development, or
ntire absence of the septum, all point to the conclusion that this is not a case
zard monstrosity. The whole series appears to me to illustrate within the
ies what has been recognized elsewhere for distinct genera, such as
copodium, Isoctes, and Lepidodendron. Where the sporangium is large, sterile
nds of tissue are present, while in smaller sporangia homologous with these, sterile
ls of tissue may be entirely absent. But whereas in the other cases quoted the
ile tissue was represented only by incomplete trabeculae, in Tmesipteris the same
is found to apply to the complete septum.

morphological change, such as has been suggested by SrraspurcEr (â€˜Bot,
1873), and not cases of individual retrogression in a plant which is, as [
suppose, on the up-grade. But when we look at the whole question from
of view of increase of number of spores, and compare Tmesipteris, Lepidodendr;
Lycopodium, if the line of advance were such as I suggest, it is just at the
the fertile zone that individual retrogression to simpler types would be expeete
