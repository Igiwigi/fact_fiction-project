The phenomenon which shows in the most striking way the rapidity with which
woitive electricity leaves its source is the production of positive-special in a high
\Snsion tube. Attention has already been called to the wide sweep which the thin
2ogitive column takes to avoid the spot at which the positive-special is being produced. ow this avoidance is due to the fact that there is negative electricity there which has
2n left behind by the positive discharge caused by the positive impulses within the
foil. Thus the side of the tube beneath the tinfoil behaves precisely as a negative
i-terminal, showing that the positive must have wholly passed away from the
e at the time the advancing positive discharge arrives at the tinfoil, and has Jeft
"Te corresponding negative electricity free to produce its full effect. 2
