of a mile an hour. This remarkable want of reciprocity was much commented on by
the observers, although they appear to have been entirely at a loss to account for it.

On reading M. ARaGo's report*, I noticed that the observations on the barometer
showed Montlhcry to be about 80 feet above Villejuif, and it occurred to me that
this difference of elevation might afford a clew to the mystery. I had observed in my
observations of the effect of wind upon sound that a difference of a few feet in the height
of the obseryer or in the source of sound, especially when near the ground, often made
all the difference between hearing distinctly and not hearing at all. It appeared to me
probable, therefore, that there might be something advantageous in the situations of the
gun at Montlhery and the observers at Villejuif over the situations of the gun at Villejuif
and the obseryers at Montlh6ry. I was confirmed in this impression by a fact mentioned
by ARaGo, viz. that on the first night the gun at Villejuif had been pointed upwards
at a considerable angle, but that thinking this might have had something to do with its
not being heard s0 well as the other, on the second night it was brought down to the
horizontal. The result, however, was that the gun was not heard 80 well on the s8econd
night as it had been on the first. This remark concerning the gun at Villejuif seemed
to imply that it was fired from level ground and at no great elevation, whereas at
Montlhery it seemed possible that the gun might have been fired over a parapet. To
settle this question I took an opportunity last Easter of walking over the ground from
Villejuif to Montlhery, and by the aid of a map made a section of it.

The two stations are visible from each other; that at Villejuif is on the top of a
gently rising hill, whereas that at Montlhery is on the top of a very steep sugar-loaf
