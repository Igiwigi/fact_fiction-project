substitution, relaxed molecular clock, are diverse [1-4] and are now referred to as relaxed clock procedures. More atten-
divergence time estimation tion has been devoted to rate variation over time than to the fact that not all kinds

of nucleotide substitutions experience the same pattern of rate variation. Most

notably, the rate in mammals at which the CG dinucleotide changes to TG (con-

ventionally referred to as CpG transitions) is high and, when compared with

other substitution types, relatively constant [5-7]. The approximately clock-like

mutation mechanism that can operate during the majority of the mammalian life-
cycle [6]. Presumably because of this mechanism, CpG transitions accumulate in
