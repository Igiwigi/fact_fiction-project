Under
favourable conditions the ratio of expansion to the subsequent contraction, measuring
the amount of hydrochloric acid formed, may be as much as 7 or 8, so that in
PRINGSHEIM’S experiments, where the expansions were 2 millims. on his scale, the
hydrochloric acid formed may have escaped detection. PrinasHerm{ further con-
cluded that the expansion due to a given quantity of light was independent of the
amount of hydrochloric acid formed—independent of the state of the induction, This
conclusion, however, is not borne out by more careful experiments—-in fact, a corre-
sponding phenomenon to the period of induction appears in the case of the initial
expansion (see below, p. 83). * «Phil. Trans.,’ “ Photochemical Researches,” Part III.
