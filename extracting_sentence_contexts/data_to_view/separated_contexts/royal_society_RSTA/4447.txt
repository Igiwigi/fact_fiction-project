The pertinent numerator can be regarded as a kind of ‘distance’ between two
contiguous probabilities. Thus, a different ordering of the pertinent summands would lead to a
different Fisher information value. In fact, if we have a discrete PDF given by P = {pj,i=1,...,N},
we will have N! possibilities for the i-ordering. The question is, which is the arrangement that one could regard as the ‘proper’ ordering? The
answer is straightforward in some cases, the histogram-based PDF constituting a conspicuous
example.
