'= It is known, that, if a muscle and its nerve be covered with
Z two pieces of the same metal, no-motion will take place upon
5 connecting those pieces, by means of one or more different
5 metals. After making this experiment one day, I accidentally
A applied the metal T had used as the connector, and which I
Still held in one hand, to the coating of the muscle only,
while with the other hand I touched the similar coating of
the nerve, and was surprised to find that the muscle was im-
mediately thrown into contraction. Having produced motions

in this way sufficiently often to place the fact*beyond doubt;
I next began to consider its relations to other facts formerly
known. TI very soon: perceived, that the. immediate exciting
cause of these motions could ' not be derived from the action
of the metals upon the muscle and nerve, to which they
were applied ; otherwise it must have” been admitted, that
my body and a metal formed together a hetter' conductor
of the exciting influence than a metal alone, the contrary of
which I had known, from many experiments, to be the case. The only source, therefore; to which it could possibly be re-
ferred, was the action.
