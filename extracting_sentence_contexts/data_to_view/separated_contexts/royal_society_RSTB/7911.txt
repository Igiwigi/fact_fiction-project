Nor is it likely that the force of mortality varied with age in
the same manner in the two species in Rowe’s sample, or that the chances of fossilization
were the same for both, since one was probably a burrower, while the other crawled
about on the surface of the sea-bed (see p. 406). In general, the length, breadth or height of an animal, or the size of any part of it,
will be highly correlated with its age, older animals being, on the whole, larger. ‘Thus to
compare one sample with another, or one species with another, by comparing the means
or medians of variates which are highly correlated with the size of the animal, will involve
making quite unjustified assumptions, and may give very misleading results. In fact, in quantitative palaeontology the assumption is often made, although not
explicitly, either that the age distribution of the sample is the same as that of the living
population, or that all the samples have been biased in exactly the same way. Means or
medians are then employed for purposes of comparison. The defence of this practice
would appear to be that, from the very nature of palaeontological material, it is impossible
to do any better.
