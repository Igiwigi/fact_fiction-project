Accordingly, a dual price also solves the minimization problem below

This characterization of the dual price as the one minimizing the discrepancy between the
expectation of best margin from the agents and the total payment they receive. In turn, the
payment is related to the margins seen by the ISO in (2.4), so the dual problem is in fact
minimizing the differences (2.6). These relations justify the naming of minimal uplift that is
associated with the dual prices in [8], also called convex-hull prices in the electric engineering
literature. When there is no discrepancy, the minimal uplifts are all null and in the optimization
jargon it is said that there is no duality gap.

For the duality gap to be zero, convexity is again of paramount importance. If the primal
problem (2.2) is convex, so is the value function (2.7). In this case, we claim that a dual price 2*
supports the optimal dispatch. This can be seen by combining the various definitions with the
convexity assumption, to write

v(D) = min max L(p, u, 4) = max min L(p,u,d) = 0(2*).
