Dr. K1iDp observes,# that * it blackens sulphuric acid when
boiled with it ; the addition of water to the mixture having
no. other effect than to dilute the colour, neither does any
precipitation take place upon saturating the acid with am-
monia,””

Mr. CHAMBERLAIN states, | that sulphuric acid probably
decomposes naphthaline, for that it holds but a very small
quantity in solution. . The true interpretation of these facts
and statements will be readily deduced from' the following
experimental details. 1. Production and properties of the new arid formed from
Ssulphuric acid and naphthaline,

Naphthaline, which had been almost entirely freed from
naphtha by repeated sublimation and pressure, was pulve-
rised ; about one part with three or four parts by weight of
cold sulphuric acid were put into a bottle, well shaken, and
left for 36 hours.
