but more pronounced line was visible when the distance between the inocula was 50 or
60 mm. Mycelial tests of these cultures proved that the DH; on the side nearer to the
DHg inoculum had changed into DH.

The diameters of some of the cultures after four days’ growth at 20° C., and of others
after three and five days at 12° C. are shown graphically in fig. 5.

It appears from fig. 5 that the growth rate of DH¢ was unaffected by its proximity
to DH, since all three graphs for DH, are almost horizontal lines and such deviations
as occur are slight, and probably due to the fact that an overgrowth of DH; frequently
prevented accurate measurement by obscuring the margin of DHo.
