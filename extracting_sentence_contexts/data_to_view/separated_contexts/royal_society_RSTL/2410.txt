This distance, or /agging, of the pole of the
watery spheroid behind the place which it would occupy if the earth and luminary
were at rest, is owing to the resistance of the shores and of the parts of the water
amongst each other; and its amount is determined by the amount of these resistances. But we are very far from being able to trace the mode in which these causes operate,
s0 as to be entitled to affirin that changes, and even small changes, in the force or
velocity of the disturbing body, may not produce corresponding changes in the extent
of this lagging. In fact, there seems to be good reason to 8uppose, from other circumstances, that the
force and velocity of the disturbing body do affect the distance by which the actual
elevation lags behind the elevation of equilibrium. For 3 and x, the lagging in the
ease of the 8olar and of the lunar tide, are quite different ; the former (for the London
Docks) being 3% 25‚Äù, the latter 1 25= *, It is true that this difference of 2% is, in the
