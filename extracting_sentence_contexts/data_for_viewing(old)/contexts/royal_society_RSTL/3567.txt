less than half the actual strength of the beam.
In considering this question, I was forcibly struck by the circumstance, that, in
applying the law of * ut tensio sic vis‚Äù to contiguous fibres, under different degrees of
tension and compression, the effect of lateral adhesion is omitted, and each fibre is

supposed to be capable of taking up the same degree of extension and compression
from the same force as if it acted separately, and independently of the adjoining fibres.
But it is well known as a practical fact, that there is a powerful lateral action which
tends to modify the effect of unequal strains.

If, for example, a bar, abcd, have a strain applied at efdb, the portion +;
defb will not be extended 80 much as it would be if separated from |
acef, unless an equal strain is applied to the portion acef. And if a
portion of a bar cannot be extended in proportion to the force applied to
it, unless the contiguous part is equally strained, it follows that the outer
portions of a beam subjected to transverse strain will not be extended in
proportion to the force applied, because the part nearer the neutral axis
is not equally strained. The measurements made for obtaining the posi-
tion of the neutral axis afford direct evidence on this point.
