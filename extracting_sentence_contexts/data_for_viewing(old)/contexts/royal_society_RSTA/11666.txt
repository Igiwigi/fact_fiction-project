COMPLETE FREEZING-POINT CURVES OF BINARY ALLOYS. 53

At the end of the experiments the alloy was weighed and found to be 270 grams,
while from the statement of the weights of antimony and silver used, the weight
should have been 285 grams. Some of this loss is due to metal adhering to the
pyrometer, stirrer, and crucible, but the missing 15 grams cannot all be accounted
for thus; there has certainly been a loss of alloy by volatilization or splashing. This
fact renders the atomic percentages of the latter part of the series somewhat
uncertain.
