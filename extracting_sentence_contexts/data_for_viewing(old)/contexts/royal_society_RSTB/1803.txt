numerator the number of illegitimate births, and as denominator that of unmarried
people (U’ or U”). Thus the special illegitimate fecundity for the female sex is
iN/U",. But let us here remark that it would be erroneous to think that the
addition of the legitimate and the illegitimate natality would furnish the measure of
the whole fecundity existing in the midst of a population. Fecundity is the effect of
a physiological,process,. The measure of its force can consequently be recognized for
that part of the population only which is exposed to this cause, that is for married
people. For these the event of a birth is the effect of a natural law, whilst, on the
contrary, each illegitimate birth represents but an exception, an offence against social
laws. Thus the total of legitimate and illegitimate natality offers only the statistical
expression of the state of things, but not the measure of the force of procreative power.

5. Especially with the legitimate fecundity, we have to provide for the fact that
the number of children depends not only on the number of husbands or wives at the
procreative age, but also on the condition that both partners of the couple be still
prolific. The birth-rates mentioned before are all monogenous ones; it needs no
proof that the bigenous birth-rates furnish a more reliable measure of legitimate
fecundity. To obtain this measure we have to put into the denominator the
couples (C) at productive age. The fecundity of productive couples, applicable only
to legitimately united ones, is thus measured by JN/C,.

6. But the mass C, (couples at “ productive age”) changes with the arbitrary
choice of its age-limits and is therefore not exactly defined. We find finally that
the only right measure of fecundity is obtained by investigating not the fecundity of
the whole preductive population, but for a single age element of it. We arrive then
