'The normal gas from which all light has been excluded, needs, as we have
shown, a certain length of exposure before the maximum action is attained. The
length of exposure is not altered when the pure gas is allowed to stand for some time in
the dark before insolation. If, however, the gas contains such minute traces of impuri-
ties that the maximum action is not thereby lessened, we still find evidences of the pre-
sence of these admixtures in the fact, that on standing in the dark the time required for
the attainment of the maximum induction is considerably shortened. This phenomenon
