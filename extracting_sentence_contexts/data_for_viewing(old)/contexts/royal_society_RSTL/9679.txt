We have, then, by art. 13 (i)

«=[0]+[1]+[2]+2=38+3, 30+4, 38+5, or 30+6
while

We have proved then that the 8um of any number of integrals of the form indi-
cated by the fact that they are rationalized by the introduction of y, where

Ptpay+py+Þ;=0,

can be reduced to the gum of three; the equation-of condition being gy*+qy + =0%
where q\=qz+1, and q, lies between q, and q+3 inclusiye.

22. We have shown that the 8um of any number whatever of similar functions guch
as are discussed in this paper can be reduced to an expression algebraical or logarithmic
added to a fixed number of snch functions whose variables are functions of the variables
of the given functions, this fixed number depending only on the form of function
