Deep and superficial to the radicles this plexus is connected up longitudinally to form
a pair of irregular, broken subsidiary trunks (Plate 86, fig. 13, s.f.) lying one on either
side of the main efferent filamentary vessel. From the main trunk and from these subsidiary plexiform trunks numerous branches
spread out over the general surface of the filament and connect with a network of
larger and more irregular vessels, which from their appearance should be lymphatics. Many of the components of the plexus that envelopes the radicles of the efferent
filamentary vessel closely embrace these little arteries as they enter the main
filamentary vessel; so closely, in fact, that in some cases little but the endothelium
of the artery separates the cavities of the two, though I did not observe any actual
opening from one to the other. In all the injections made of these “ fine” vessels in
the gills it was very noticeable that they were distributed to the connective tissues
underlying the mucous membrane of the gill arches and filaments, with special
concentration around the efferent filamentary vessels and their radicles, but that
they did not supply the intrinsic muscles. The disposition of the non-respiratory vessels in the gills of the Cod, though in certain
particulars in harmony with one or other of the older descriptions, differs from them
all in various ways, and indicates that there are in the gill four systems of vessels other
than those purely concerned with respiration.
