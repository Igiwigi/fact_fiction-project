nessed the marked distinction between the ossification of these endo-skeletal parts and
the superadded dermal ossified layer, and have made no mention of it. He, in fact,
maintains his opinion, © that the plastron is nothing else but a part of the dermo-
skeleton, and that it has nothing in common, in an anatomical point of view, with
the sternum of other animals*,” thus diverging to an opposite extreme from that of
the Geoffroyan hypothesis, although rather by arguments drawn from the relative
position of other parts of the skeleton and from Comparative Anatomy than from the
actual phenomena of the deyelopment of the plastron.

* Tf the plastron of the Chelonia were the homologue of the sternum in other
Vertebrates,” says RaTHkE, © one must also admit that the bones composing the
shoulder and pelvis are situated in a manner entirely contrary to the general dispo-
sition of those parts in other animals.” But that remark would equally apply as an
argument against the carapace being homologous with the vertebra and ribs, as
