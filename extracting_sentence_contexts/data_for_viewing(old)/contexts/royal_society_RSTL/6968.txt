CY Beside the absorption by olefiant gas, IT have placed that by carbonic acid derived
= trom Table XXXI. The superior power of the acid is most decided in the smaller
= tensions; ata tension of an inch it is twice that of the olefiant gas. The s8ubstances
© approach each other more closely as the quantity of gas augments. Here, in fact, both
S of them approach perfect opacity ; and as they draw near to this common limit, their
= absorptions, as a matter of course, approximate.

Z The temperature of a hydrogen-flame, as calculated by BUNSEN, is 3259? C., while that
S of a carbonic-oxide flame is 3042* C. The foregoing experiments demonstrate that
© accord subsists between the oscillating periods of these sources and the periods of
S aqueous yapour and carbonic acid at a temperature of 15% C, The heat of the flame
E goes to augment the amplitude, and not to quicken the vibration.
