X15 +..)%, With real coefficients. Thus it follows from our choice of H(X) that D(X’) is not
identically zero.
We write J(X’) = h,,(X’) D(X’)

and we take G’ to be the grating defined by the polynomial J(X’) in the (n—1)-dimensional
space &’. This is permissible as J(X’) is not identically zero.

Let K be any cell of G and take C to be the sum of all the cells of G’ whose domain con-
tains some point of the orthogonal projection K’ of K on the space #' (i.e. the set K’ of all
points X’ = (x,,...,x,-,) such that for some x, the point X = (x,,...,%,) is in K). Clearly
Cis a complex on the algebraic grating G’. We eventually prove that C is in fact the closure
of K’. We first prove that C contains the closure of K’. By our inductive hypothesis G’ has
only a finite number of cells. So C is the sum of a finite number of closed sets and is thus
closed. Let A be any point of K, and let A’ be the projection of A on &’. Then A is the
limit point of a sequence Xj, X,,... of inner points of K, and the projections Xj, X3,... of
X,, X,,... are inner points of K’ converging to A’. But there are points Y’ of Z’ not on G’
arbitrarily near to the point Xj, for 7 = 1,2,.... Since any point Y’ of Z’ not on G’ is in the
domain of some cell of G’, and all points Y’ of Z sufficiently near to X/ are in K’, it follows
that there are points Y’ of C arbitrarily near to X;. Thus A’ is a limit point of limit points
X), X,, ... of C. As C is closed it follows that A’ is in C. This proves that K’ is contained in C,
and so C contains the closure of K’.

Now consider any cell $ of the grating G’ contained in the complex C. We shall prove
