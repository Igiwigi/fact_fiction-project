The earlier experiments are rejected as having been effected on very impure
hydrogen, affording values entirely too low. A very small impurity by volume will
seriously affect the result of experiment. The error due to an admixture with
another gas is, in fact, very nearly proportional to the percentage of impurity by
weight. The hydrogen was generated from granulated distilled zinc, under the action of
dilute “pure” sulphuric acid. It was purified, in the case of the immediately
succeeding experiments, by passing it through a tube containing pumice and a
solution of silver nitrate, and then dried by passage through a tube containing
sulphuric acid on pumice, and three tubes of phosphoric anhydride, passing through a
fourth tube of the same nature between receiver and sphere.
