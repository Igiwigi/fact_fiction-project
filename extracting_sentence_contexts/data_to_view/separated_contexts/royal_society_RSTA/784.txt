Comments and open problems

While in the discussion of Yang-Baxter integrability we have concentrated on the success of
hydrodynamical approaches, there remain several limitations. Given an arbitrary initial pure
state, it remains an assumption that this will evolve into a GGE to which hydrodynamics can
be applied, and there are not in general practical methods to calculate which GGE a particular
state evolves into. Related to this is the fact that the Bethe-Boltzmann equation describes ballistic
propagation, while spin currents, for example, have a diffusively decaying part as well [50]. At
low temperature the ‘coarse-graining’ length and time scales for a GGE to become established and
for hydrodynamics to become valid for non-Bethe-state initial conditions are expected to diverge. The most dramatic agreement so far with microscopic density-matrix renormalization group
calculations is obtained for energy flows in XXZ, which are known to be somewhat special
because of the energy current conservation mentioned above [45].
