as to the limits of the species of this order.

Whatever other causes there may be for this anomalous distribution, one, no
doubt, is the nature of the Christmas Harbour area. This is almost occupied by
transverse valleys that run east and west completely across the north tip of the

island, from sea to sea, are bounded by hills 1,200 feet high, and are perennially
swept by terrific blasts from the westward. There are, hence, no shelter on land for
the terrestrial flora, and no quiet bays for the proper development of a yaried marine
vegetation ; facts which may yery well account for the paucity of Oryptogams in
Christmas Harbour, but not for the presence there of nearly all the flowering plants
of the island. Turning again to the south-eastern area, its more sheltered yalleys
and land-locked harbours favour not only a greater development of Oryptogams,
but als a far greater luxuriance of the Phanogams than obtains in Ohristmas
Harbour; which last fact renders the absence of additional species of Phzenogams to
the south-eastward all the more remarkable.

The question remains, granting that the great majority of the Phaenogams of
Kerguelen Tsland are deriyed from South America, how was their transport effected ?
Though this question cannot be satisfactorily answered by a reference to the facilities
for distant transport possessed by the fruiting organs of the Kerguelen Island plants,
it is only proper to refer to these organs in some detail. Obviously, regarding the
