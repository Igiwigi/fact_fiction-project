to crushing was taken into account. As a result, both the penetration depth and the crater radius
were obtained. Later this model was extended to account for localized plastic strains [24].

Once, looking at an oscillogram, I was surprised by a sharp decrease of the resistance at a
moment when the projectile was at a substantial distance from the rear surface. I knew something
in fracture mechanics and even published a book on this subject [25], but it was only theoretical
knowledge. It took some time before I realized that the (effective) surface energy plays a role in
this process, although it looks negligibly small compared with the total penetration/perforation
energy.

Nevertheless, it plays a dominant role. In the usual cases where the crack speed is higher than
that of the projectile, a conical crack propagates ahead of the latter, and the resistance drops when
the crack reaches the rear surface. Taking this fact into account, I determined the size effect: the
perforated thickness is proportional to the projectile diameter of power 4/3. This result had a
substantial impact on some applications.

Another size effect, with the exponent 13/8, was found for the force action on sea ice [26]. Once,
when I had an enjoyable stay at Clarkson University, Prof. John Dempsey showed me an article
with the same exponent. This result was obtained independently, but in that case it appeared that
Johnâ€™s author published his article later.

I met John P. Dempsey when he was visiting Robert Goldstein at the Institute for Problems in
Mechanics in Moscow. We then worked together on crack closure theory, mainly for ice fracture
mechanics. I already had some experience in this area, but not in the crack closure effects. It was
not an easy task; however, I think we made a notable contribution to the field. In particular, radial
