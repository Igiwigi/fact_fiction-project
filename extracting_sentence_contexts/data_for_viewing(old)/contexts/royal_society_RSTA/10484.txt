In fact, the general shape of the current E.M.F.
curves was much like that of the curves for
current and temperature obtained with carbon
and platinum. There was no indication of
saturation at any potential.

These differences are to be attributed to the
difference in the experimental conditions and
especially in the shape of the electrodes. In
the case of sodium we have a large ionisation
