gradient direction is due to the retarding of the wind velocity below the gradient
velocity by friction or by viscosity. One might expect, therefore, that the wind
would attain the gradient direction at the same height as the gradient velocity. This
would, in fact, follow from the theory of GuipperG and Monn. Most observations
have failed to give reliable information on this point, partly because irregularities on
the surface of the earth have introduced complicated conditions, which cannot be
taken account of, and partly because the observations have not been grouped according
to the wind velocity.* Neither of these objections applies to Mr. Donson’s observa-
tions. Salisbury Plain, though inferior to the sea, is as good a place for wind
