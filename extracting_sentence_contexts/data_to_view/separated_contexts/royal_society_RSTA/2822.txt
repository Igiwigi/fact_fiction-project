For a representative fixed 6 of unity, the results of varying the
incident wall shear 4 are presented in figure 5. These indicate a critical value 4 = 41 (about 83.0) at
which the shape and pressure response become unbounded on linear grounds, or ‘intensification’
takes place (giving a weakly nonlinear stage followed by a strongly nonlinear one, depending
on details, see below). In fact, an infinite sequence of such critical values or eigenvalues 4 = Ay is
obtained. Such resonance is present for any 6 value.

5. Resonance leads to nonlinear evolution and transition

The resonance phenomenon has an interpretation in terms of flow transition as depicted in
figure 6.
