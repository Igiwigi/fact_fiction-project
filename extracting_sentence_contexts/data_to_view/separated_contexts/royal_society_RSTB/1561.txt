The extremely diminutive size of the air-bladder, when compared
with the bull of the Fish, taken in conjunction with such facts in the structure of
the organ as those indicated above, force us to adopt the conclusion that the air-
Sbladder in Glyptosternum and Bagarius must be regarded as a vestigial and function-
“less structure—a conchision which veceiyes additional support from the existence
Sof similar retrogressive modifications in the Weberian mechanism, and in those
2purts of the internal ear that are specially related tu it.
” Ih our necessarily imperfect account of Akysis and Acrochordonichthys there were
Sseveral interesting points that we were unable to determine with certainty, of which
Sthe most important were, the condition of the dorsal walls of the ait-sacs, and the
Spresence or abserice of a sinus endolymphaticus. We cannot but think, however,
that our tentative conclusions with regard to those genera derive considerable support
from the resulis of our inyestigations of G/yptosternum and Bageaius, From the
‘Sstrong resemblance between the four genera in all essential osteological details, as well
in the general structure and skeletal attachments of their air-sucs, and in the
‘Scondition of the Weberian ossicles, we now entertain but little doubt that, so far as
re Ahysis and Acrochordonichthys are concerned, the agreement extends also to the
atrophied condition of the dorsal walls, tle suppression of the sinus endolymphaticus,
‘Zand, in fact, to the rudimentary and functionless condition of both the air-bladder and

"3 We could detect no essential differences between this species and the preceding,

A Luelyptosternum (sp. ?). Tu an undetermined species of this genus given to us by Dr. Day, we found the
dir-bladder and Weberian mechanism very similar in almost every detail to the
correspontling structures in Glyptosternum,
