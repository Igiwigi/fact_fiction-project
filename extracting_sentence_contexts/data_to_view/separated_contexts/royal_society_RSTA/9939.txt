The discussion of the 11:125 years’ period has been entirely based on the results
& of the last 75 years of last century. Between 1749 and about 1826 the periodogram
4 only gives a faint indication of the period. This remnant I ascribed at first without
further investigation to the fact, that the 11 years’ period had come into life towards
the beginning of the century, and therefore had to some extent affected the interval
1750-1826 to which curve B of fig. 2 applies. This was an error which for some
time kept me off the right track. The question of the permanence of the periodicities is one of vital importance, and I
s have endeavoured throughout to keep my mind free from all preconceived notions.
