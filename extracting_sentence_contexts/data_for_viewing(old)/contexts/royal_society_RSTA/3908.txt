with its target audience, it is necessary to see from the point of view of that audience. Rather
than censoring out of sheer risk-aversion, corporations are navigating the challenges of CDRs’
potential for both good and bad in nuanced, reflexive ways that result in the evolution of
new ethical approaches to data-sharing infrastructures and practices. They also experience data
production as an ecosystem where different stakeholders have contractual rights, interests and
property claims. On this basis, firms are highly incentivized to keep control of data from LMICs
because they have high value as a proprietary resource that contains insights about business
processes and customer preferences as well as the potential for professional learning and positive
perceptions on the part of customers and governments—and this value is balanced by a high
negative potential for the firm if the data are misused.

One underlying reason for not wanting CDRs not to become a public good is that this value is
linked to their scarcity. The calls for data to operate as a public good effectively highlight the fact
that it does not currently do so, and the debate highlighting CDRs’ importance to researchers and
policymakers effectively increases the status of firms as gatekeepers of high-value data. Out of the
two overarching models for data sharing—one where an intermediary holds and provides access
to multiple datasets, versus another where firms control the process of data sharing—the second
is likely to be more attractive to data proprietors because it both creates scarcity and focuses the
good publicity arising from such projects mainly on the firm.

The ecosystemic characteristics of private-sector data demonstrated in this paper make it
harder for data to be shared without an idea of its eventual purpose. Firms experience data-
sharing projects as single-use constructs created through negotiations with a constellation of
different actors, including country affiliates, country governments and security services, the firm’s
customers, and different departments within the firm’s headquarters, including CSR management
