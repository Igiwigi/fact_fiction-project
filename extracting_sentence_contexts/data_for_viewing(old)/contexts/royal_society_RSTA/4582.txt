‘Doubt is our product,’ ran the infamous memo written by one tobacco industry executive
in 1969, ‘since it is the best means of competing with the “body of fact” that exists in the
minds of the general public.’ The industry defended its primary product—tobacco—by
manufacturing something else: doubt about its harm. ‘No proof’ became a mantra that they
would use again [and again]... It also became the mantra of nearly every campaign in the
last quarter of the century to fight facts [1].

Merchants of Doubt

1. Introduction: doubt as an academic problem

In the 1950s, the tobacco industry established a programme to defend its product against the :
scientific evidence of its harms. Working with the public relations firm Hill and Knowlton, : =
industry executives realized that they could compete with the body of fact that was emerging 5
from scientific research by insisting that the science was not yet settled—in effect, by putting ‘the 1B
body of fact’ in scare quotes—and so it would be wrong, or at least premature, to restrict customer : wu
choice by banning their product or even discouraging its use. 78
