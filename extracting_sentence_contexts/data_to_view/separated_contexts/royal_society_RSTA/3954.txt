Saliva is normally used in the assays targeting drugs of abuse (amphetamines, opioids and
cannabis) [71,72], therapeutic drugs [67,70,73], alcohol (ethanol), hormones (cortisol) and steroids
[64]. Salivary metabolomics can provide an outlook for diagnosis of oral cancer and periodontal
disease [74,75]. In fact, many researchers are interested in the composition of saliva proteome
[76]. Saliva can also be analysed to monitor human exposure to toxic elements such as arsenic
[77]. MS analysis of nasal mucus has not yet become popular.
