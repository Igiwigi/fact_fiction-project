Modifications in RDGE and CINE are algebraically synonymous with the CICE6 baseline, but
slightly alter the numerics of the continuity and momentum equations, respectively. The KSNO
case results in a Category III climate change owing to the modelâ€™s strong sensitivity to the
thermal conductivity of snow [43]. In fact, we define any parameter change in an existing CICE
configuration as a Category III change that would first be detected during maintenance of the code
repository, rather than by the 2SPT and QSC tests. Nevertheless, KSNO serves as a benchmark
against which RDGE and C1NE may be compared. We seek to answer three questions using the RDGE-C1NE-KSNO suite: First, are the combined
2SPT and QSC tests sufficiently sensitive to differentiate Category I, II and III code modifications?
