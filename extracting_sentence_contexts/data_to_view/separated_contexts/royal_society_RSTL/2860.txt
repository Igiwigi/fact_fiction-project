In computing, by
the method here used, some of FraunnoreR's indices, in which small discrepancies
were found, Sir W. R. Hamrrox undertook to investigate what amount of alteration
in the values of A would account for those differences. He communicated his re-
searches in a letter to myself, with the values of x, and consequently those of @ and b,
thus altered. I have repeated the calculation for oil of cassia, but find this change
quite insufficient to remove the discrepancy ; and that, in fact, a much larger altera-
tion than could for a moment be allowed in Frauxnortr's data, must be supposed,
in order to produce any sensible effect. 3. The entire method of computation here followed, though founded on the exclu-
sion of those approximate suppositions which are allowed in the simpler formula, is
yet dependent on the omission of terms in the series for p beyond the three first*,
