Considering fig. 5, we may suppose that the contribution of the iron in the
eutectoid, to the total magnetisation at 697° C. during heating, is represented by the
distance between the point P on the upper curve at that temperature and the
corresponding point Q on the lower curve at the same temperature. In the one case
the eutectoid has not yet begun to lose its magnetism ; in the other it is just about
to regain it.

+ Such considerations are accentuated by the fact that, although the solenoidal field remains constant,
the field within the specimen increases as its magnetisation falls. THE EUTECTOID TRANSITION POINT OF CARBON STEELS. 187

We may assume tentatively that the intercept PQ is a measure of the amount of
iron in the eutectoid and that, similarly, the intercept QM is a measure of the amount
of excess iron. The ratio of these two, QM/PQ, can then be compared with the
calculated ratio of the excess iron to the eutectoid iron.
