for CER NS 24:0. CER NS 16:0 with symmetric tails shows a sharp interleaflet boundary and
both of the tails remain perfectly ordered. In contrast, the ends of the longer fatty acid tails of
CER NS 24:0 assume a liquid-like disordered structure, giving the bilayer a sandwich ordered—
disordered—ordered structure [23]. The longer fatty acid tail is further supported by dynamic
bending at the head group region that gives rise to a slithering motion of the tails back and
forth along the layer normal direction. The electron density of CER NS 16:0 in figure 2c shows
a prominent dip in the bilayer midplane. There is a constant electron density region between the
peak at the head group positions (z ~ +2 nm) and the bilayer midplane (z = 0) determined by the
length of the tails. For CER NS 24:0, the peaks at the head groups are further apart (z ~ +2.5nm)
and broader, reflecting the slithering motion of the tails. The liquid-like overlap region shows
much larger electron density in the bilayer midplane than CER NS 16:0. The constant density
regions of both CER NS 16:0 and CER NS 24:0 bilayers have the same density and width,
reflecting the fact that the ordered region is determined by the sphingosine tails of the same
length shared between the two species. Figure 2d shows the lipid mass density (symbols) in a
mixed bilayer comprising a 1:2:1 molar ratio of CER NS 22:0, 24:0 and 26:0. The densities
from individual components show that the shorter-tailed CER NS 22:0 (solid line) has a dip in
