When first discharged the eggs are usnally more or less distorted by pressure
.Aluring their passage through the cesophagus ; within a few minutes, however, they
Fecome perfectly spherical, and have an average diameter of about *35 mm. They are
Sf stony opacity, 80 that the germinal vesicle is invisible, and are destitute of any
Sproper limiting membrane, though the peripheral layer of the vitellus is clearer and
Beas granular than the rest. The entire substance of the vitellus is densely packed
Svith deutoplasm granules, which upon rupture of the egg appear as clear yellowish
Spherules. Polar cells were never observed.

â€” It will be convenient to describe first those changes which are visible from the
Sxterior, leaving to the next section an account of the corresponding internal changes

discovered in sections. In a third section a review of the facts will be given,
Su cog with a discussion of their significance.

The 8egmentation of the egg in Renilla is remarkable for the surprising amount of
individual variation of which it is capable. $0 great is this variation that it is safe to
8y that no two eggs ever develop in precisely the same way ; and although most of
the variations may be arranged in a definite series, ome of them are 80 irregular that
they seem to follow no definite law. No one indeed without actually following the
entire development of some of these eggs would suppose them capable of vormal
development. For a long time, in fact, I passed by some of the less usual forms as
due to abnormal or pathological changes, and only after repeated and careful sbudy
was able to convince myself that these peculiar embryos gave rise to active larve,
