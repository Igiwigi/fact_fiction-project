mass-loss and hinting that they may be about to evolve back to the blue [11] (figure 1).

Lifetimes of the RSG phase range from 2 Myr for 8 Mo stars, down to around 0.5 Myr for 25Mo
stars, with little dependence on metallicity or rotation [4]. At the lower mass end, the RSG lifetime
is determined by how quickly the core can proceed from He to Si burning, and so is sensitive to
the details of stellar structure. At the high mass end, stripping the star of the H-rich envelope will

evolve the star back to the blue, and so the lifetime is sensitive to the mass-loss rate. Of course,
close binary evolution would do the same job, and so can substantially shorten the RSG lifetime
of stars of any initial mass. In fact, for a population of stars in binaries with a distribution of mass
ratios and separations, it has been argued that the average RSG lifetime may be a factor of 2-3
shorter [13].

3. Temperatures

As mentioned in the previous section, as He burning begins the stars will swell up until
they reach the Hayashi limit—the maximum stable radius for a convective star. It is,
therefore, worth discussing what this temperature is, what determines it and how theory and
observation compare. Dos
