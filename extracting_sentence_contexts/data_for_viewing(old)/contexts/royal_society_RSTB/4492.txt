confined to the centrum of the first vertebra ; it extends to the piers of the arch of
this vertebra and to the pro-atlas. Such a close association of the whole vertebral
front with the back of the skull is a character which irresistibly recalls certain fishes
among the Teleosts, in which the first vertebra is similarly plastered on to the occiput.
It seems to point to a time when, as my friend Mr. Goopricu remarks, the limit
between skull and vertebree was in a state of flux.

Caudal Vertebre.—Unfortunately these are not represented in my sections. By
no means anticipating that the specimens would yield so much detailed information,
I restricted my attention to the head and its vicinity, Had I known the full value
of the material placed in my hands, I should have prepared sections of the entire
skeleton. My regret is tempered, however, by the
fact that the caudal vertebrae have been described
by Wixuiston who asserts that they are without
[free] chevrons, and thus definitely Amphibian.
They are said to be 17 in number and without ribs
or diapophyses. :

The Ribs (figs. 40, 44).—In all but those of the
second and third vertebre the ribs are two-headed,
the tubercular process extending about 4 mm. or
5 mm. beyond the capitulum. All the ribs have
suffered some displacement, and are now folded back
against the sides of the vertebral column, round
which they curl to cross one another below on the
