Hence, light transitions are important factors
in the input of the environment to both the seasonal photoperi-
odic timer and the daily circadian clock. The question remains as
to the mechanistic relationship between them. Elucidating
the exact physiological role of circadian clock genes is compli-
cated by the fact that the core circadian clock genes are
transcription factors or transcription regulators and can exert
pleiotropic effects, making it challenging to distinguish clock
from non-clock functions of these canonical clock genes [8]. One way of disentangling this confound is by comparing
patterns across latitudes with those across elevation. At any
specific latitude on the same day of the year, regardless of alti-
tude, daylength is the same today as it was 10000 years ago
and will be 10000 years into the future.
