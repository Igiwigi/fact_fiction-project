1. Causal learning, counterfactual reasoning, and pretend play:
a cross-cultural comparison of Peruvian, mixed- and low-
socioeconomic status U.S. children

Children from a variety of backgrounds spontaneously engage in pretend play’.
Pretend play universally emerges in typically developing human children
between 18 and 24 months of age, and the frequency and complexity of pre-
tence increases during early childhood (for reviews see [3,4]). Even children
from cultures where adults discourage pretence spontaneously pretend [3,5],
suggesting that pretence may have an innate and evolutionary basis. This
may seem perplexing, given that there are no obvious adaptive benefits of pre-
tending. In fact, superficially, it would seem a waste of time to engage in a
fictional world when children still have so much to learn about the real one.
