the 6 material was formed. Eosin was particularly effective and caused ? crystals
to be produced, and to remain without change in contact with water (containing
the dye) even at 50°. The curiously specific nature of these relations may be illus-
trated by another fact. Mercuric azide also exists in both a stable orthorhombic
x form and in an unstable one of lower symmetry,* but the presence of dextrine is
quitewithout influence on the formation of the § modification or on its stability when
formed. Rapid Deposition

The effect of dextrine or gelatine on the crystallization of the « azide was first
noticed by Lownprs}.
