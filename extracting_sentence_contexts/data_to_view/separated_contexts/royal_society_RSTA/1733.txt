This explains the crucial importance of accurately modelling
hydrodynamic instabilities in ICF conditions. Generally speaking, an outstanding question is
whether or not classical turbulence theories apply to hot dense plasmas. In fact, recent theoretical
studies have uncovered novel dissipation mechanisms of the kinetic energy for compressing
plasmas [36]. This has strong implications for astrophysical turbulence, as well as for ICF [37,38]. The recent developments in the field of laser-driven hydrodynamic instabilities experiments are
therefore very rich, and we will try to summarize some of them.
