c=10.05A (B-LiyBy2H12); a= 13.62, c=9.63A (a-LizBy2Hy2); a= 13.23, c=9.36A (Li2ByoHy0);
a=14.51, c=10.26 A (NapBi2Hyz); and a = 13.96, c=9.87 A (NazB 9H). Lattice-contracted and
lattice-expanded variants of LizB;2H12 were generated by applying equiaxial volumetric strains
corresponding to 12% and 14% contraction and expansion, respectively. Further information can
be found in [20,21].

Lig PS4: Born—Oppenheimer AIMD simulations were run with the Vienna Ab-initio Simulation
Package (VASP) [170] using projector augmented wave pseudopotentials [171]. A timestep of 1 fs
and a 128-atom supercell for 50 ps of production time were used. The supercell lattice parameters
were a= 12.78A,b=15.74A and c=12.04A.

LGPS: Car-Parrinello AIMD simulations were run for 45 ps of production time using a 2 x
V2x1 supercell at 700 K. A CP fictitious mass of 400 a.u. and a timestep of 0.15 fs were used. The
supercell lattice parameters were a = 12.69 A, b=12.45A and c=12.45 A.

LLZO: Classical molecular dynamics simulations were run on the cubic phase of
Lig.25La3Zr2O}2 using the LAMMPS code [172] based on potentials adopted from Ref. [63].
Production runs were for 5ns with a 1fs timestep at 1100K on a 2x2 x2 supercell. A
Nosé-Hoover thermostat was employed to maintain the temperature.

(b) Diffusion barriers

The diffusion activation energy barriers in figures 4a and 6c were determined by performing
linear fits to the long-time behaviour of the cation mean squared displacement at each
simulated temperature, then using the Nernst—Einstein relation to extract the diffusion coefficient.
