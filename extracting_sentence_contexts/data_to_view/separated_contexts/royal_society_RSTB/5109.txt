The tubules of the digestive diverticula, like those of the other Lamellibranchs (YONGE
(1926) ), show no histological evidence of secretion, nor did the examination of blood
corpuscles which had been in the stomach for four hours indicate any action by digestive
enzymes. It appears, therefore, that, though capable of modifying their feeding
mechanisms and the structure of their alimentary canal, the Septibranchs have been in-
capable of modifying their digestive processes. The Lamellibranchs have retained the
power of intracellular digestion to a far greater extent than the other large groups of the
Mollusca, which is clearly correlated with the fact that in the Lamellibranchs alone are
fulfilled the two essential conditions of intracellular digestion, namely, the maximum
of ingesting surface (in the ramifications of the tubules of the digestive diverticula) and
the presentation to this of fine particles which can be directly ingested, the latter being
ensured by the rigorous sorting action of the ciliary mechanisms on the gills and the palps

and in the stomach. In the Septibranchs the second of these conditions is absent,
and it is only by the crude method of breaking up the large prey in the stomach that
small particles for passage into the diverticula can be obtained. In no other metazoan
carnivore, with the exception of certain of the Turbellarians (see WesTBiap (1923),
Winter, etc. (1925) ), where the gut cells are amoeboid and unite to form syncytia during
absorption, when they take in water and swell out so that they surround the soft food
which they ingest intracellularly, is there this complete lack of a preliminary protein
digestion.
