coexisting attractors) it is necessary to carefully study the dynamics and acoustics of systems with
inherent or augmented strong nonlinearities in order to predict system parameter and excitation
ranges for which the desired benefits are realized robustly. Therefore, critical to the promoted


strongly nonlinear approach is the formulation of new nonlinear concepts, methodologies and
techniques that enable accurate theoretical predictions of the system responses, as well as
reliable experimental validations of the theoretical findings. Accordingly, and given the highly
‘individualistic’ nature of nonlinear systems that restricts the unifying dynamical features which
are amenable to common analysis, our approach of intentional use of strong nonlinearity for
energy transfer and management dictates innovative theoretical and experimental advances to
unlock fundamental new nonlinear phenomena over broad and diverse areas and settings. ‘The
challenges related to this task are highlighted by the fact that in the proposed strongly nonlinear
approach oftentimes no linearization is possible, so conventional analytical techniques based on
linear or weakly nonlinear approximations are no longer applicable’.

Perhaps the most common example involving nonlinear TET are those occurring between : S
modes/scales in turbulent fluid flows, whereby energy gets continuously and unidirectionally : 2
transferred from large-scale vortices to small-scale ones. From an energy transfer perspective : &
turbulent flows have two very important properties, namely they are robust and almost _
impossible to suppress, and are capable of dissipating large amounts of energy compared to 4
laminar flows of the same energy. What is the reason for this efficient dissipation in turbulent 7s

large number of modes (broadband spectrum) resulting in simultaneous dissipation over a large 18
