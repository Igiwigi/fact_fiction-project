The most striking example which I have seen of this was
presented by the blood of a bat, which had lived some days after having been severely
wounded. In that case, chains of red discs might be seen adhering firmly by their edges,
notwithstanding considerable force of traction operating upon them, and before they at
last gave way, tail-like processes of considerable length were drawn out between every
pair of corpuscles, indicating that they were very adhesive. These facts seem sufficient
proof of the correctness of the view above expressed regarding the cause of the rou-
uXx.
a The adhesiveness of the red corpuscles does not appear to be a vital property. When
Jhe fibrine has been removed from a drop of blood during the progress of coagulation,
e rouleaux will form again, after being broken up, as many times as the experiment
_ until the blood becomes thick from dryness ; and if evaporation be pre-
Jented by Canada balsam placed round the plate of thin glass, with suitable precaution
against the approximation of the two plates, the rouleaux will remain perfect for several
'Zlays (e. 9. fourteen in one experiment of the kind), after which the very slow che-
Anical action of the balsam upon the blood gradually renders it confusedly red and
"Spaque. Gum mixed with blood seems to preserve it, like a pickle, from decomposition
r a very considerable period; and if a piece of wet lint be suspended above such a
Specimen 80 as to prevent eyaporation, the corpuscles will retain their adhesiveness for
A long time (e. 9, twenty-four days in one instance), until the water communicated to
e mixture by the artificially damp atmosphere gradually renders them non-adhesive.
