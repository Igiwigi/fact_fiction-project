corrosive sublimate were inaccurate. The latter supposition is very much less
probable than the former. With regard to the relative value of the experi-
ments made with calomel and corrosive sublimate, I rely most on the analyses
of the latter, since it is much more stable as regards the action of heat, and
hence more certainly obtained in a pure state than calomel. I therefore infer
that, 202 may be considered as a close approximation to the real equiyalent
of mercury.

Before closing this communication, I will avail myself of the opportunity to
make a few remarks on the employment of filters. In so far, indeed, as re-
spects the experiments which haye been described in the present and preced-
ing Essay, the discussion is not very material, since most of the principal facts
have been ascertained by processes independent of filtration ; but in reference
to analysis in general, the subject is very important. In my own researches
I am in the habit of determining the weight of substances collected on a filter
in one of three different ways. One of these, introduced by Bzrzervs, consists
in burning the filter in a platinum crucible, and deducting the weight of its
ashes. This method is peculiarly applicable to the analysis of minerals, where
such substances as silica, alumina, and lime are frequent. Even some sub-
stances of easy reduction, such as peroxide of iron and sulphate of baryta,
may be safely treated in the same way ; but in these cases it is advisable not
only, as usual, to separate the mass of the precipitate from the filter before
setting it on fire, but to moisten both with a little nitric acid, and to ensure
very free exposure to the air during the burning of the paper and the sub-
