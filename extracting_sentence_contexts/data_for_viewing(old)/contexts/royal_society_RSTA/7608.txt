sodium measurements was 5 %, for which the spread of asterism lay between 5 and 10°,

according to temperature, while for gold the glide extended to over 40 % and the spread
of asterism at 5 % glide was 1 or 2°.

* With nickel no satisfactory photographs of asterism were obtained, as explained in the section on
nickel.


MECHANICAL BEHAVIOUR OF SINGLE CRYSTALS 195

The explanation of the spread of asterism with comparatively little hardening at high
temperature is probably to be sought in the fact that, as already found with other metals
(Tsien & Chow 1937; Andrade & Chow 1940), the spacing of the glide planes is markedly
coarser at high temperatures with gold and silver. This means that the glide is con-
centrated in comparatively few regions where it would be large, which necessarily entails
large asterism.
