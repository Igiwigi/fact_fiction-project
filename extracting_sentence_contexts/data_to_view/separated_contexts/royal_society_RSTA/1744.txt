It seemed possible to find a plausible explanation of the motion
of a movable wire in the plane of aâ€˜circuit on this basis, The experiments described
on pp. 123 and 124 showed that the two exist simultaneously, and that the electro-
magnetic effect under the conditions of the experiment was about twice that observed
for the recoil. Moreover, the rates of increase of the two with the current strength
were different, a fact which effectively disposed of this idea. The writer has observed a similar recoil upon the suspended cathode within a
highly exhausted vacuum tube, but the mechanical effect has not yet been
measured,

The experiments were conducted in the Physics Laboratory of University College,
Reading, and valuable assistance was given by Mr. J. 8. Burgess.
