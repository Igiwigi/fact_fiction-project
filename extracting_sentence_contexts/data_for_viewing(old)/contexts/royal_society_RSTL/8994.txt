For example, without doubt an appreciable quantity of gas is occluded, as indicated
by the conditions of the residues (se account of experiments Nos. 10 and 38) and by
the disengagement of gas generally observed upon addition of water to the residue. In
some instances also there may be, under the high pressure of explosion, a trifling
leakage from the apparatus.

One point we must not pass over without obseryation. The deficiency of hydrogen

Q in the products of explosion, although absolutely small, is relatively very large. The
ON question then arises as to whether the missing hydrogen may not be present in the
E form of aqueous vapour. None was detected in the analysis of the gases; but it is not

= difficult to explain this fact, as the extremely hygroscopic property of the residue would
= most effectually dry the gasesâ€”the absorption of the yapour by the residue being
SZ actually demonstrated by the greasiness obseryed on the surface of the deposit and on
S the sides of cylinder immediately on its being opened after explosion. The entire

2 The amount of water present can, however, be calculated from the deficiency of
