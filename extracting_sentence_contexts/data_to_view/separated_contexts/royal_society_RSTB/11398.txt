Disasters at Hajj locations
and other pilgrimages have been linked to collective behaviour
[43], often with the implication that crowds at these holy sites
lack the critical judgement necessary for coordinated conduct
[7,13,43]. The present study suggests an alternative view of


the relation between collective behaviour and disaster risk
reduction in crowded locations, which side-steps attempts to
define rationality (versus ‘panic’) in these contexts (cf. [8]),
through the use of the concept of social identity. As well as
explaining disasters, we need to explain the fact that most
of the time the Hajj crowd is orderly. Shared social identity
in a crowd is an established predictor of cooperative and
coordinated behaviour and can therefore help explain that
orderliness. Space and place (for example carrying out rituals
in spiritually important buildings) can serve to enhance the
salience of social identities [44].
