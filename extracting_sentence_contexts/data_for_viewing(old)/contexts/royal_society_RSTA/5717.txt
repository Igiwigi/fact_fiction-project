physical states [79]). Since SU(3) is a compact Lie group, the complete bond space is tied to the
regular representation of SU(3), and thus intrinsically infinite-dimensional [79]. Therefore, it is
mandatory to introduce approximations, or cut-offs, to manage numerical simulations of lattice
QCD or other non-Abelian lattice gauge models [80].

4. Rishons and dressed logical bases

At this stage, the only missing ingredient to enable numerical simulation of the aforementioned
lattice gauge Hamiltonians via TN methods is the selection of a physically relevant finite-
dimensional subspace of the lattice gauge field (bond space), to be included in the simulation.
We stress that in one-spatial dimension, under open-boundary-conditions, this problem can be
circumvented by ‘accumulating’ the matter gauge-charges from one edge: this fact is notorious
for the gauge-Abelian Schwinger model [81], but it has been recently shown to allow non-
Abelian generalizations [82]. From two spatial dimension, this strategy cannot be exploited,
and physically relevant cut-offs based on energy-density has to be introduced to access low-
temperature lattice-gauge physics with TN, as routinely done when studying lattice models of
interacting soft-core bosons [83].

Asimple, yet meaningful choice of truncation is based on the ‘electrical’ part of the pure lattice-
gauge Hamiltonian, ie. the first row in equations (3.3) and (3.6). For each Rishon mode, only a
selected number of irreducible representations (irreps) of the gauge group are fully included:
those with quadratic Casimir value below a given cut-off, i.e. states with weak electric gauge
field. Other irreps are fully excluded. The nice aspect of such an approximation is that the cut-off
itself can be tuned, thus numerical convergence in the cut-off can be systematically tested, which
