The main
question demanding solution, therefore, was as follows :—Is this plate the enlarged
madreporic plate (genital 2) only, and if so what has been the fate of the other four
genital plates? Fortunately, the material available was sufficiently advanced to
furnish the answer to this question. The imago at metamorphosis is almost circular in outline, 0-4—0-43 mm. in diameter,
and, owing to the fact that it possesses a lantern of Aristotle, is even more like a regular
urchin than is the imago of a Spatangoid (Gorpon, 1926, b, p. 272). Very soon the
test becomes ellipsoidal (fig. 18, / = 0-56 mm., b= 0-44 mm.). The pentagon having
at each of its apices an ocular plate occupies a large proportion of the dorsal surface.
