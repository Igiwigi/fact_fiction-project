The second series whose law is stated in
Art. (2) leads to an equation of this kind. In fact the

equation
#—(489 +689, +c89.)u,, —(«S +852) u,,=0

coincides in succession with the whole series of equations
there assigned ; and if we write instead of the coefficients of
this, the following,

a $9 +bS9, +89, +a89, +b8®, + c 89,
«5 +882, +-89, +882, + 289, + 88,
they are reduced to a common period of circulation, and the
equation may then be integrated as above. - It remains to

consider equations with more than one independent variable
whose coefficients are circulating functions.

(12). A circulating function with two independent varia-
bles may have a double period of circulation, and may in
general be represented thus :
