- system properly s0 called, and then endeavour to ascertain to what parts of that
Sh system the powers on which those functions depend belong.

Z The mere structure of the parts might have led physiologists to suspect that the
= organs of this system possess other powers than those just enumerated, We find two
E distinet classes of nerves, to one of which the functions subservient to the sensorial
2 powers evidently belong, and it has never been proved that the other at all partake
S of these functions. Besides, it had appeared from experiments relating to this 8econd
[= class of nerves, although their results were differently reported by different writers,
= that they must possess functions of a wholly different nature.

A Such were the circumstances which called my attention to this, as it were super-
EZ added, class of nerves ; and I think it will appear from the facts I am about to adduce,
EZ both what are their functions, which we shall find much more complicated than those
= of the former class, and why the results of the experiments just referred to have been
SZ 50 differently reported.

= The peculiarity of structure relating to these nerves is, that, while all the former
5 class proceed, either from the brain or spinal marrow, directly to the parts they in-
A fluence or which influence them ; they either enter or send branches which enter a

chain of protuberances called ganglions, from which nerves are sent to the parts in-
fluenced by them. Hence they are termed ganglionic nerves, a term however, which
has not heen employed in a very strict sense; because, besides the ganglions just
mentioned, which receive nerves from different parts of the brain and spinal marrow,
