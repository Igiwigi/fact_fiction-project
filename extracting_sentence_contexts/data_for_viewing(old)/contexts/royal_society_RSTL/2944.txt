Single insects evolye any appreciable heat, the bulb of a thermometer was passed
into the body of a * single chaffer,‚Äù through an opening under the wing-covers, and
examined half-hourly for about two or three hours, but no heat was detected. In
several experiments made by myself in a similar manner to this by Dr. BzrTaoLD,
particularly on the Melolontha vulgaris, STEPA. (Table VI. Nos. 45 to 52), the amount
of heat developed yaried from 2? to 9? above that of the atmosphere, and was always
in proportion to the activity of the insect.

272 MR. NEWPORT ON THE TEMPERATURE OF INSECTS.

These facts are suflicient to prove that insects have a high temperature of body;
and that it is higher in their perfect than in their larya or infant condition. They
also beautifully accord with the facts ascertained, and the views deduced from them
by Dr. Epwarps, respecting the difference between the temperature of the young
mammiferous animals and their perfect adults.

I. Temperature of Insects as influenced by various conditions.

Abstinence, Inactivity, Sleep, Hybernation and inordinate Excitement.

1. Abstinence.

Having shown the difference between the temperature of the larva and perfect in-
