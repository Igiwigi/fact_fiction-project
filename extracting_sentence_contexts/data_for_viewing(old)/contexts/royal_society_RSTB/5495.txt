464 B. SAHNI ON ASTEROCHLZNOPSIS, A NEW GENUS OF

phyllotaxis goes hand in hand is a special feature of Asterochlena and Asterochlenopsis
not shared by any other known member of the family. If the stele of Asterochlanopsis
were to become deeply invaginated here and there between the rays (at some points more
deeply than at others) we should have a condition somewhat like a simplified Astero-
chlana stele. Knowing the transformations which modern fern steles undergo during
the ontogeny, it is not inconceivable or even improbable that the long spidery arms,
so characteristic of the stele of Asterochlena, were only an “ adult ” feature replacing
a simpler, more or less cylindrical, condition in the juvenile state. It is by no means
suggested that there is anything specially “ juvenile ” about the stele of Asterochlenopsis,
but the structure of the stele, viewed comparatively, does seem to support the conclusion
drawn from the facts of leaf-trace development.

I confess the idea did cross my mind that if the more distal parts of the stem and leaf
were available the Kirgis plant might show itself to be in reality an Asterochlena :
that, if traced distally, the stele would begin to develop spidery arms over the protoxylem
bands, and the petiolar strands tend to show an Asterochlenoid curvature. But at least
so far as the foliar bundles are concerned I have reason to believe that their actual form
may safely be taken as the definitive one.* By calculating the rate at which an average
petiole diverges from the vertical axis} I have found that it requires a length of at least
18 cm. to pass from the inner edge of the peripheral zone, where the clepsydroid form has
already been acquired, to the outermost edge of the fossil. During this very considerable
distance there is no sign of an adaxial curve, and it is highly improbable that one will
develop higher up. Asterochlenopsis thus seems to be a definitive type and not a stage
