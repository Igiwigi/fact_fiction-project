Do not take these criticisms badly: they are not meant to dismiss these interpretations; they are
simply the reasons commonly expressed for which each interpretation does not sound plausible
to others: the point I am making is that there is no interpretation of QM that is not burdened by
a heavy cost of some sort, which appears too heavy a price to pay to those who do not share
the passion for that particular interpretation. Many discussions about quantum theory are just
finger-pointing to one another’s cost.
The evaluation of these costs depends on wider philosophical perspectives that we explicitly
or implicitly hold. Attachment to full fledged strong realism leads away from Quantum
Informational interpretations and towards Bohm or Many Worlds. Sympathy for empiricism or
idealism leads in opposite directions, towards Copenhagen or Quantum Information. And so on;
the picture could be fine-grained.
The beauty of the problem of the interpretation of QM is precisely the fact that the spectacular
and unmatched empirical success of the theory forces us to give up at least some cherished
philosophical assumption. Which one is convenient to give up is the open question.
The relational interpretation does not escape this dire situation. As seen from the reactions in
the philosophical literature, relational QM is compatible with diverse philosophical perspectives.
But not all. How strong is the philosophical ‘cost’ of relational QM?
Its main cost is a challenge to a strong version of realism, which is implied by its radical
relational stance.


(b) Realism

‘Realism’ is a term used with different meanings. Its weak meaning is the assumption that there is
