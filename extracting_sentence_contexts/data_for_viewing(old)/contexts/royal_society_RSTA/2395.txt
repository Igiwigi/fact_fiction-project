]. Introduction

The history of the spectroscopic discovery of H3+ on Jupiter, its molecular spectroscopic
characteristics and its use as an ionospheric tracer have been reviewed in [1,2]. Only general
facts relevant to the present study will be repeated here, in the new perspective of constraining
models of upper atmospheric structure for the observations at mid-latitudes of Jupiter and the
giant planets. It has been known since the first observations of the 21m emissions of H3+ in
the overtone 2v2 band [3] that access to ionospheric emissions on Jupiter in the infrared (IR)
from ground-based telescopes would give a powerful new tool to constrain auroral emissions,
which were limited previously to ultraviolet (UV) observations from space. This detection in the
overtone band of H3t was rapidly followed by observations in the fundamental band at 3.5 ym
[4], and then imaging of the emission in IR filters [5].

In this paper, after a short review in §2 of previous observations and their importance
for the understanding of the processes in Jupiter’s upper atmosphere, §3 will review the
measurements and methods of retrieval of physical atmospheric parameters with their limitations
and uncertainties. Then, in §4, observations of mid-latitudes in H3* emissions will be discussed.
