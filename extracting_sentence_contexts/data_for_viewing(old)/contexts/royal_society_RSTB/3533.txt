As in Specimen P, so also in PP, the primitive knot, immediately in front of the
blastopore, is of considerable dorso-ventral extent, but decreases in thickness as it is
traced forwards. This decrease in thickness is not, as in the previous specimen,
accompanied by a simple arrangement of the cells around a wide transverse
archenteric cavity (as shown in fig. 44). In the specimen now under consideration
the cells do undergo some rearrangement, but into the form of groups or masses.
The constituent cells of each mass tend towards a disposition about a central cavity,
actual or potential; and each focal cavity obviously represents a segregated portion
of the original cleft-like archenteric cavity.

The differentiation of these cell-groups is, however, confined to a very limited
region immediately behind the plane at which the ventral archenteric wall undergoes
disintegration. But for the fact that they attain to great definiteness and extension
in the slightly more advanced Specimen E, they might have been passed over
without special remark in the present case. Figs. 52-54 represent photomicrographs
of three consecutive sections across the archenteron in Specimen PP, the last of which
shows the disintegration of the archenteric floor. It is easy to see, if a comparison
be made between figs. 44 and 45 on the one hand, and figs. 52-54 on the other, that

the continuity of the archenterie lumen, illustrated in the former figures, has been
interrupted in the latter by localised fusions of the dorsal and ventral walls, which
interruptions appear as if they resulted from a series of indentations or inflexions of
