added. When, therefore, a fresh supply of hot water arrives, its heat has to traverse a
series of strata of water, each of which is at a lower temperature than it would have
been if the supply of hot water had been continuous, â€”that is, if the upper layer of the
column had been maintained at a maximum temperature instead of being only moment-
arily raised to that temperature by each successive addition of hot water to the upper
vessel,

$ 18. It seems, indeed, clear that the condition of M. DgsPRETz's column, after the
thermometers have become stationary, results from the establishment of thermal equili-
brium between the continual accession of heat from above downwards, and the escape
of that heat through the sides of the containing vessel by radiation and atmospheric
conduction; otherwise it is impossible, with our present knowledge of the nature of heat,
to explain the fact observed, that even after sixty hours the lowest thermometers how
no increase of temperature in the lower strata of the column.

III. Description and use of the Diathermometer.
$ 19. The object immediately proposed in the following investigation was to deter-
mine the relative and absolute thermal resistance offered by a given thickness of a given
liquid in a given time, when the liquid has a given temperature, and when the tempe-
rature difference between the liquid and the source of heat is known. 'To effect this, an
apparatus had to be devised which would be applicable to many different liquids, and
