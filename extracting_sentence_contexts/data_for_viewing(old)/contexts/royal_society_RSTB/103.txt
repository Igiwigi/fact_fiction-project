It is obvious, on a little reflection, that there would be nothing in these facts
which contradicts the explanation I have given. Since the gemmules stimulate the
protoplasm of the cells to greater activity—as indicated by the increased supplies of
starch and the hypertrophied growth—it is clear that the needs for the increased
activity will be satisfied only in proportion to the ability of the host-plant to furnish
supplies : darkness would cut off the supplies of carbo-hydrates, and drought those
of water and minerals, and thence the parasite and protoplasm in the tubercles suffer.
This can be directly shown in water-cultures, as well as in the case of plants growing
in the open. As regards the generalisation that the tubercles are commoner in soils
which are poor in nitrogenous substances, this might be because there is more oxygen
supplied to the very large active root-systems in such soils ; a view, moreover, which
is in accordance with the well-known fact that the tubercles are apt to be more
abundant and larger on those parts of the roots which are nearer the surface of the
soil, though this is not necessarily the case. There is another point to note here.
Tscurrcu himself observes (p. 90) that the Leguminosx are deep-rooted plants which
do not thrive well in rich humus-soils, abounding in nitrogenous materials. Now,
without agreeing with him to the extent of his generalisations (for it is by no means
established that the Leguminosr as a class are dependent on one kind of soil), it is
obvious that nothing in this contradicts the explanation of the tubercles as hyper-
trophies due to the stimulating action of a symbiotic Fungus. Tscutrcu lays great
stress on the facts that the analysis of the tubercles shows them to be relatively very
rich in potassium, phosphorus, and nitrogen, and claims that the abundance of nitrogen
is due to the “ bacteroids”: no doubt this is the case, since the “ bacteroids” are of the
nature of Fungi—yeast-cells—structures known to be particularly rich in potassium and
