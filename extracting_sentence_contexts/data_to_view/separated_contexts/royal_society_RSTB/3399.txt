All are agreed that, of the three living genera, Ephedra is the most nearly allied to
the lower Gymnosperms. If the group is monophyletic, it is not a little remarkable
that its highest members should, in the deferred development of the embryo, have
reverted to conditions so characteristic of primitive seed-bearing plants. Beyond the fact that in Gnetum the oospore elongates to form a tubular suspensor, we
have little information as to the early changes following fertilisation.|| It is probable
that, as in Ephedra and Welwitschia, a primary suspensor with an initial cell at its
tip is formed, as a result of the first division of the oospore-nucleus, though BowEr
states that no terminal cell is cut off before germination.1 This tubular suspensor is

described as occasionally undergoing branching, a condition which has not been met
with in Welwitschia.
