G. LEATHEM ON SOME APPLICATIONS OF

(expressed now in terms of z) into the left side of the transformation. For example
if one factor @ of linear range a, to a,,, and angular range yx were introduced, the
transformation would be of the type

Ml (z—a)-* dz = (w—a)-?(w—B)-*dw,. . . . . « (182)
with the condition
Ky bit eK y SMEG, 6 6 ee eS ee (183)

A practical inconvenience of the present method of constructing transformations
applicable to the ship problem lies in the fact that, while the condition (129) or
alternatively (133) secures that the angles px and gz shall have any prescribed sum,
it does not suffice to secure prescribed separate values for these angles. When this
is desired there is a further condition to be satisfied in the form of a relation between
the parameters —c, @, dy, ...,¢. What is wanted is that the vector angle of the
complex (c)—§(—c) shall be —pz, and this is equivalent to

Vector angle of f St (2) dz = —pr.
