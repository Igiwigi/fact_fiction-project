Similarly, the piezoelectric harvesters can be used to generate electricity
as a result of multiple physical interactions or mechanical vibrations in the environment and use
the same to fuel the low-power electronics in the eSkin. Likewise, the triboelectric nanogenerators
(TENGs) working on the principle of energy generation under mechanical deformations such as
pressing, touching, bending and stretching are most interesting for eSkin applications and have
recently gained significant attention [38,156â€”-158]. In fact, a TENG based on single electrode with a
load of 0.1 G@ has been recently shown to deliver a power density of 500 mW m7 by harvesting
biomechanical energy for self-powered tactile sensor applications [156]. The skin conformable
TENG can be coupled to the energy storage devices such as the micro-SC for energy-autonomous
self-powered sensor applications [157]. The summary of various self-powered energy devices for
large area flexible eSkin is presented in table 3.
