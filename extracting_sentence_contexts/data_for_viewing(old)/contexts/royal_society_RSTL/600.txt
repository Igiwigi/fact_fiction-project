92 Count Rumrory's Enquiry concerning the Nature of Heat,

When we consider this experiment with attention, we shall
find reason to conclude, that if it were by facilitating the ap-
proach and temporary contact of a succession of fresh particles
of the cold air of the room to the surface of the glue, (which was
now in fact become the surface of the hot body,) that the
cooling of the instrument was accelerated, the metal being as
completely covered, and the air, supposed to be attached and fixed
to its surface, as completely excluded by one coating of the glue
as it could be by two, or more, two coatings could not possibly
accelerate the cooling of the instrument more than one; but if,
on the other hand, the cooling of the instrument in this experi-
ment was accelerated, not by facilitating-and accelerating the
motions of the circumambient cold air, but by facilitating and
increasing those radzations which are known to proceed from hot
bodies, I conceived that two coatings of the glue might possibly
accelerate the cooling of the vessel more than one. In order to
put this conjecture to the test, I made the following decisive
