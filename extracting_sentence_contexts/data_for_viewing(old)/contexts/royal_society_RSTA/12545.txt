MR, R. A. SAMPSON ON STOKES’S CURRENT FUNCTION. 455

; | 4g met by the fact that the damping effect of even slight friction is increased consider-
ably by high velocities. Now a viscous liquid can move irrotationally, and if there
were no friction at the boundaries this is the class of motion it would take in cases
of flux past or through obstacles. But if the obstacle terminated in a sharp edge,
this would make the velocity there infinite, and the friction, however inconsiderable
| elsewhere, would here become of account. The boundary conditions which were
necessary for the existence of irrotational motion throughout the liquid would no
longer apply, and the whole character of the solution would be changed.
| This would, at any rate, seem to apply to cases in which the whole motion is slow,
and when, consequently, the boundary conditions which must hold are pretty well
N understood.
2 The paper concludes with an attempt to discuss the flux past a spheroid or through
a hyperboloid at whose boundary there may be slipping. The current function is not
