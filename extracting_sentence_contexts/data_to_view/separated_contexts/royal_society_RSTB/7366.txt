84 R. H. D. SHORT ON THE ALVEOLAR EPITHELIUM

the alternative scheme of alveolar budding supported by Bremer (1935). Whether or not the
desquamation of epithelium from the distal portion of the respiratory tree be accepted as
a fact (and strong evidence has been produced to show that this occurs in the foetus and
persists in the adult), epithelial growth cannot account for the quantitative facts of growth
of the lung lumen and its subdivision. Nor can it account for the fact that the structure of
a 5-day-old lung can be reproduced by simple inflation of one that has never breathed. One further step can be taken. The number of septa is clearly a function of internal
surface area of the lung which is therefore a linear function of the rates of growth of lung
volume and interstitial volume.
