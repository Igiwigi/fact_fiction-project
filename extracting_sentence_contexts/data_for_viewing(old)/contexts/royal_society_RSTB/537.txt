nitre bed, everything leads to the conclusion that the nitric acid is developed especially
at the expense of organic substances. But it does not necessarily follow that the
gaseous nitrogen of the atmosphere cannot contribute, within certain limits, to the
production of nitrates. It is to ascertain whether this co-operation takes place that
the new experiments were undertaken,

In the next year, 1860,* Bousstncautt placed a mixture of 100 grams of very rich
vegetable soil, and 300 grams of quartz sand, in a large balloon, such as he used in
the previous vegetation experiments, moistened the mass, and then closed it perfectly
by means of a caoutchouc cap. A second experiment was also arranged, in which the
conditions were precisely similar, excepting that 5 grams of cellulose were added to
the mixture.. The materials could not be stirred, and it was decided to leave them in
contact with confined air for a considerable time. The two vessels were, in fact, left
for 11 years, when, in 1871, they were opened, and the contents examined.

The result was that in both cases there was a very considerable amount of nitrifica-
tion, representing in Experiment 1 rather more, but in Experiment 2 with the cellulose
less, than one-third of the original nitrogen of the soil. The actual loss of carbon was
more than 4 times as great in Experiment 2 with the cellulose, as in Experiment 1
without it ; amounting in Experiment 1 to about 16 per cent., and in Experiment 2 to
about 43 per cent. of the original quantity.

Lastly, as to the nitrogen :—In Experiment 1, without cellulose, there was out of
04722 gram total nitrogen in the original soil, a loss of 0:0212 gram, corresponding to
4°5 per cent. of the original amount ; and in Experiment 2, with the cellulose, there
