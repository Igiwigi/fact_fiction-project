find there the function of adduction and retraction of the shoulder with flexion of the
elbow.

Summing all these facts together, we would advance the suggestion that an exact
parallelism exists between the topographical relations just described and the sequence
of movements in such a very frequent purposive action as that of, first, directing the
gaze upon an object ; next, reaching forward of the upper limb with extension of the
joints to seize it; and, thirdly, the withdrawing of the arm with adduction of the
shoulder, and carrying of the hand to the mouth by flexion of the elbow.

& We are loath to lay too much stress on these deductions, as they are necessarily
FÃ©peculative, and also because we feel that a great deal has yet to be done in explana-
dion of the fact that there are several movements relatively frequently performed

sby the head and eyes or the limbs, and yet which we have not been able to elicit by
Slectrical stimulation from the regions in which they are presumably represented.
S For instance, we have never observed the movement of direct upward rotation of
Bhe eyeballs, nor even circumduction of the shoulder, nor, to any marked degree,
Bxtension of the hip.

sb It seems to us probable that the absence of these special movements is owing to the

Bncthod of analysis. The excitation of the so-called motor cortex by a faradie current
Gs most obviously a very different effect-producing agency to the normal passage of a
pretve impulse from the sensory perceptive areas, as occurs in the early stages of an
