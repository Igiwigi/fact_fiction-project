of the face and head, is evidently much greater than in those which are governed from
the marginal gyrus.

Effects of ablation of the excitable areas of the cortex upon sensibility.â€”It is much
more difficult than would at first sight appear to determine in animals whether a part
in which motor paralysis has been produced by a lesion of the cerebral cortex is
deficient in sensibility. For, on the one hand, the subject of the experiment no longer
possesses the power of voluntarily withdrawing the irritated part, and thus the most
obvious indication of perception of sensation is necessarily absent, while, on the other
hand, there is the possibility of an involuntary or reflex response which might without

- due care be taken to indicate the continued existence of sensibility. It is, however,
undoubtedly the fact that in our cases of cerebral lesion producing paralysis of
voluntary motion reflex movements of the paralysed part are produced with great
difficulty and require a powerful stimulus; from which it would appear that the
inhibitory action exercised by the brain over reflex movements is not only not removed
by a lesion of the cortex which is accompanied by loss of power voluntarily to produce
contraction of the muscles, but is on the contrary markedly increased by such
lesion.

We have seen sufticient, however, to convince ourselves that a lesion of the cortex

which produces paralysis of voluntary motion in a part is not necessarily accompanied
