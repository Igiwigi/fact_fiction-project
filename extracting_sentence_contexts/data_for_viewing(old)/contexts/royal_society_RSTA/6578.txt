The increase of the logarithmic decrement due to the reversals of the magnetic stress
is, for small stresses, proportional to the latter. When the magnetic stress reaches
1°800 the friction increases in greater proportion than the stress, until the latter ex-
ceeds 12°935, when the ratio B: A begins to decline.* This is what might be expected
from the behaviour of the magnetic permeability as the stress is gradually increased :
in fact, with this particular specimen of iron, the permeability was found to increase
very rapidly as the magnetic stress rose from 3 to 5 C.G.S. units, and again fell very
rapidly when the stress rose from 12 upwards.

The damping effect of magnetic stress, when applied as above, is noteworthy for its
magnitude ; for the logarithmic decrement when the wire is subjected to reversals of
a magnetic stress of 28°540 is actually between twenty and thirty times as great as
when the wire is free from stress or under the influence of a sustained magnetising
stress.t
