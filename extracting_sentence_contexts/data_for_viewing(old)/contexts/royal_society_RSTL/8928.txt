The proximal part of the columella is shaped like a planting-* dibble,” but the conical
end is all soft, and the ensheathing bony shaft narrows and twists itself as it runs
forward (fig. 8, it.st.). The rounded face of the subconical part fits against a shallow
notch on the antero-superior edge of the stapes, and its inner face lies in the Tecess.
Considered as a segment this answers to the short © interstapedial ” of the Frog (op. ct.
plate viii. fig. 9, .st.).

But that which forms the main bar in the Frog, the © medio-stapedial,” is here one
fourth only the length of the proximal piece, and is a very small cylindrical bone. The
two bones fit close together, and the end piece leaves much cartilage unossfied—a 8oft-
ended * symplectic.” The soft part bends at right angles upon the little © medio-sta-

* It, cannot be an unmeaning fact that, whilst the Frogs subdivyide their columella into two 8egments of
cartilage, as in the Sturgeon, the Toads should haye theirs marked off into two parts by two separate bony rods,
as in the Osscous Fishes. '

pedial” (m.s.), and suddenly dilates into a Jarge plate, like the blade of a spade ; this
is the *extrastapedial” (e.st.). This plate, which has some calcified patches, sends
upwards and backwards from its inner face a band of cartilage which coalesces with the
tegmen tympani; this is the * suprastapedial ” (s.8/.). In the Grey Frog this part does
not, coalesce above ; in the Bull-frog it does. The relation of the extrastapedial flap to
the membrana tympani is shown in the side view (fig. 7, e.st., m.t.) ; it is imbedded
