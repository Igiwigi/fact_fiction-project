First antenne distinctly three-jointed (in this differing also from the majority
of the Branchiopoda). 3. Second antenne in the adult of both sexes forming large biramous swimming organs,

forms of the Anostraca and most Branchiopods.

4. The adult male provided with a pair of powerful clasping organs, which were not
modifications of the second antennz as in the Anostraca, but arose just behind the
mandibles and were probably developed from the maxillule. 5.
