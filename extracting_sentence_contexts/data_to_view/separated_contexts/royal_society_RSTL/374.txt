The division of the pencil into two parts after it has pene-
trated the first surface, or before it has emerged from the
second surface of calcareous spar, enables us to explain the
curious fact observed by MALvs, relative to the light reflected
from the interior surface of doubly refracting crystals: He
discovered” that the ray refracted ordinarily at the -second
surface was reflected at this surface in two pencils, one ordi-
nary, and the other extraordinary ; and that the ray refracted
extraordinarily at the second surface, was also reflected in
two pencils; $0 that there were four reflected rays, and only
two emergent ones. These four rays returning to- the first
surface of the crystal, emerge in four parallel pencils, which
form with this surface the same angle as the incident ray. The cause of this singular fact will be understood from
Fig. 5, where ABCD' is a piece of calcareous spar, and mn, pe,
the lines within the crystal at which the extraordinary refrac-
tion takes place. A ray of light RS will be divided into two
pencils Sa, Sb, which will emerge in lines a, bÞ, parallel to
RS.
