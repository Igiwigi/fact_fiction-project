In some
Acanthodians, e.g. Diplacanthus and Cheiracanthus, there is evidence that in addition to
the dorsally directed scapula there was a downwardly and inwardly directed coracoid,
which might meet its fellow in a symphysis. In Climatius the scapula region is quite
like the corresponding structure in Macropetalichthys, and a coracoidal extension
certainly existed although it is not ossified. The primary shoulder girdle of Diplacanthus
is in fact like that of Macropetalichthys. (6) The tribasal pectoral fin of Macropetalichthys with its short radials is directly
comparable, except for the absence of a spine, with that of Acanthodes or Ischnacanthus. I have already shown that such a fin is not found in the earliest Elasmobranchs and
that its occurrence in a Lower Devonian fish is on the whole evidence against Elasmo-
branch affinities.
