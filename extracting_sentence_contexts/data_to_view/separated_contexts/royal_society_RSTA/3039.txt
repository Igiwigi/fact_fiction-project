The bed-plate itself was a solid plate of steel, very
Strong and resting upon two heavy tables T of the same height. & In the above description no account has been taken of a large number of small

ae which must theoretically affect the method. © The principal are the following :—(1) In the theory explained in § 2 modifications
will be introduced owing to the fact that a polarizing Nicol is introduced in the path
of the rays of light between the source and the slabs. (2) The source of light is not
a line-source, but a slit of finite breadth. (8) When the load is applied, the middle
part of one beam rises and the other sinks: thus the heights 2, z, and the relative
height 2;—2, in formula (7) are not fixed.
