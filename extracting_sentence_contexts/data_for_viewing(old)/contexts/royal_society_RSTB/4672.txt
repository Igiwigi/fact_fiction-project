In passing, it may be remarked that the ambulacrum of Lovenechinus, in its
highest state of development, is almost identical in structure with the petaloid part
of Area III in Echinocardium cordatum. A comparison of Plate 61, figs. 10 and 11,
with Plate 69, fig. 5, will make this resemblance clear. A point of morphogenesis of
extreme interest is thereby indicated. £. cordatwm is one of the most highly
specialised, as it is one of the latest, of the Spatangide, which, for reasons indicated
in Section 2 (e) below, has had occasion to develop secondary ambulacral complexity.
It has carried out this development along strictly “‘ Perischoechinoid” lines. Hence,
if E. cordatum be regarded as phylogerontic (a reasonable hypothesis), the
recrudescence of phylobrephic structure seems to-imply that reversionary tendency
in racial old-age that has been aptly termed “ second-childhood.” In a recent paper,
L. F. Sparn (1919) draws attention to the fact that the suture of Jndoceras
baluchistanense, NortLinc, with 37 lobes and 38 saddles, recalls the “acme of
specialisation among Triassic Ammonites.” He argues that this, one of the last of
the Ammonites, fails to reveal gerontic characters, and ascribes the sutural elabora-
tion to environmental conditions. By a similar argument, Lovenechinus should have
been a burrower in the sand like Echinocardium, but such a supposition appears
grotesque, in view of its general structure. May not Indoceras afford another
illustration of imperfect atavism in a gerontic form ?

In certain Carboniferous genera, of which Archeocidaris (Plate 61, fig. 14) may be
considered typical, an entirely different modification appears. The individual
ambulacral plates retain the simple ‘“ Palsodiscoid” arrangement and proportions,
while the whole area becomes sinuous in its course. This quality has an advantage
