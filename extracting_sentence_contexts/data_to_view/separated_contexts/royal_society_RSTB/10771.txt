We used allele-specific Assay for Transposase
ally been used to deal with this. Male cell lines have been Accessible Chromatin (ATAC)-seq and HiC in hybrid undiffer-
engineered to contain an inducible Xist transgene on the entiated mouse embryonic stem cells and neural progenitor
X-chromosome, which upon induction will turn on the Xist cells (NPCs) to study the relationship between 3D chromatin
transcript and lead to chromosome silencing [46]. This structure, local chromatin structure and gene expression on
approach is limited by the fact that after silencing of the the Xi [68]. X-chromosome, male cells begin to die, making it impossible
to track the later stages of XCI. Female cell lines with
dox-inducible Xist transgenes have also been engineered

but suffer the same limitation [72].
