where 4, is a positive absolute constant. This latter possibility cannot arise if n is sufficiently
large, since no point of A, other than O satisfies (97).
We have now proved that one of the lattices A,, is of the form

x=uta+ew, y=utfot+frw, z=u+(y+7,)v+(y?+7,) u,
where «a, /, y is a cyclic permutation of 4, ¢, #, where these have one of the two possibilities

of lemma 5. Returning to (95), it follows that XY is equivalent to a multiple of one of the
three products which are obtained by multiplying together two of the three linear forms

u+Ov+0-w, u+dv+¢?w, u+yo+yw. (99)
The three possible products are themselves mutually equivalent. This follows from the
fact that the field is galoisian and cyclic, so that there is a unimodular substitution which has
the effect of permuting cyclically the three linear forms (99). Hence XY is equivalent to
a multiple of (89), and this establishes the main assertion of theorem 11.

It remains to prove the final assertion of theorem 11. For this we may consider three forms

X, ¥, Z, where X=u+O+Ou, Y=ut+gv+¢,

and where Z is any form such that the determinant of X, Y, Z is 1. We have to prove that the
inequalities (90) have only a finite number of solutions for any ¢>0. We shall suppose that
6, 3, w are the roots of é + #—2t—1 = 0, and we shall prove that the inequalities

| XYZ|<x, |X|<e, |¥|<e, (100)
