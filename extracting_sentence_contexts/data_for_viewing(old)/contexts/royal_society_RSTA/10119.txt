immediate practical importance both to human beings and to agriculture.

§ 15. Returning to the consideration of Tables VIII. and IX., it will be seen that
with the exception of the values of «, in winter—when the amplitude at Kew was
so small that considerable uncertainty must exist—the Kew and Bureau Central
values of a, and @, are sufficiently close to raise a strong presumption that the 8- and
6-hour terms represent a true atmospheric electricity effect. The comparative
agreement between the phase angles from the earlier and later series of observations
at the Bureau Central and the Eiffel Tower favour the same conclusion.

The 8- and 6-hour waves are decidedly smaller at Kew than at the Bureau Central.
The difference in this case may not improbably be partly due to greater homogeneity
in the Kew data. The fact that the 8- and 6-hour terms are also much less at the
Eiffel Tower than at the Bureau Central must, however, have some other explanation ;
it is most natural to ascribe it to the influence of height,

Irregular Diurnal Changes.

§ 16. Hitherto we have exclusively considered the regular diurnal changes, those
for each month being derived by taking hourly means from about 70 days and
eliminating any non-cyclic element. The amplitude of these periodic changes gives,
however, a very inadequate idea of the phenomena. Even in the finest weather the
