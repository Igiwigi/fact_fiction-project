DHNA. The inhibitory potency of DHNA remained relatively species despite significant sequence divergence, likely


reflecting their metabolic needs. However, it is not yet known
how concentrations of DHNA vary across different bacterial
species, or are modulated over time within a bacterial cell,
or how DHNA is partitioned between the cytosol (where
it is produced by Menl) and the membrane (where it is a
substrate for MenA). By contrast to Mtb, which relies on oxi-
dative phosphorylation for growth [57,58], substrate-level
phosphorylation of fermentable sources allows Sau to grow
slowly. In fact, respiration-deficient Sau, known as SCVs,
have a slow-growth phenotype as a result of resorting to
energy generation via fermentation. Therefore, Mtb and Sau
may have different needs for the regulation of this pathway,
requiring adaptations of the allosteric site.

Assuming DHNA adopts a similar binding pose in Sau-
MenD, our overlays with the Mtb-MenD structure suggest
that several residues in the Sau-MenD allosteric site (all three
cage residues and residues 305-314) would need to undergo
movement to accommodate DHNA. It is plausible that the
initiation of DHNA binding facilitates a series of structural
changes that help to achieve this. In the Sau-MenD structure,
