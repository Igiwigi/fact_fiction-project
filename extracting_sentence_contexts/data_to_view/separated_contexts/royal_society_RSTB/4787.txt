The Regression of Yield on the Distribution Values, and on the Rainfall at Different
Seasons. The sums of squares and products of the distribution. values provide a basis for the
calculation of the partial regression coefficients of the yields upon them, but before
applying them in this way itis necessary to allow for the fact that 5 years’ yields, namely,
1890, 1891, 1905, 1906 and 1915, have been omitted ; we must therefore deduct from
the sums the contributions of these years. Table X shows the polynomial values of a’,
b’, ... , f’ for these years :—
