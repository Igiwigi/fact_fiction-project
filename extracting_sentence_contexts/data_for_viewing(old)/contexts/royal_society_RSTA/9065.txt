Again the agreement with observation must be considered satisfactory, so that
with the aid of only two disposable constants (p and R,/R) a good account has been

given of the values of sixteen observational quantities (eight values of the amplitude
ratio and eight of the phase difference). Naturally, however, the hypothesis of a
non-uniformly conducting earth such as we have considered must be regarded as
giving only a convenient idealized representation of the real facts.

The theoretical values of f’ calculated for the lunar diurnal variation are given in
Table J; they differ but little from those of Table N. The observed values in
Table J are somewhat irregular, but their mean (2°3) is in satisfactory agreement
with the calculated mean (2°5), when the accidental error of the lunar data is
considered.

§18. The Electrical Conductivity of the Earth as Deduced from the
Diurnal Magnetic Variations.

In $17 the following two quantities were determined, in connection with the
theory that the earth has a conducting nucleus of radius R, and specific resistance p,
