Trt following essay contains the greater part of a series of observations, made
between 1845 and 1850, by one whose recent death deprived physiology of one of its
most earnest truth-loving students. 'DThe papers, as left by their author, and com-
mitted to me by his father, contained little more than a record of the observations. I have arranged them to illustrate certain general facts, and have added some of the
conelusions which they plainly indicate. I have felt the more justified in making
these additions, by the belief that my intimate friendship with Mr. BaxLow would
enable me to write what he would have written, had his life been spared.
