The air flow forced by the cooling unit from a container causes the mould spores to scatter
inside the container. The mould sensor system samples the mould spores from the forced air flow
(figure 3). Due to the fact that the sampling is done by gathering the sample from the air flow,
other biomasses potentially polluting the sampling medium can largely be avoided. For an automated evaluation of the mould contamination, only a few mould species are
interesting. Which mould species are dominant in a container strongly depends on the country of
origin and the perishable goods that are transported.
