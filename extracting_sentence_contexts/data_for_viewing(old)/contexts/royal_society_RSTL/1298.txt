Oxz of the most prominent features in our last communica-
tion was the evolution of a considerable quantity of azote, when
oxygen gas nearly pure was respired ; and although a consi-
derable part of this azote must undoubtedly be attributed to
the residual gas in the lungs, after the most forcible attempt
at expiration, yet the fact seemed to demand Â«till farther in-
vestigation, it appearing of consequence to ascertain whether
the increase of azote was uniform throughout the latter stages
of the experiment, or so/ely confined to the earlier periods.
By adverting to our former Paper, it will be found, that in
an experiment where more than gooo cubic inches of oxygen
passed through the lungs in seven minutes and a quarter, 62
cubic inches of azote were found in the first 250 cubic inches
expired, though the gas originally contained but 2,5 per cent.
or only 6 cubic inches in this quantity ; in the two next por-
tions expired, consisting of 362 cubic inches, we found 56
cubic inches of azote, though this quantity of gas, before it
was respired, contained only 14; these, first portions, were
