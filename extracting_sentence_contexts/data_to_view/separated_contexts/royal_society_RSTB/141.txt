The end pointing towards the surface forms the rod (‘Stiibchen” of GRENACHER)
which is therefore terminal, not axial, thus agreeing with Parren’s expectations (15). Ihave been unable to make out the fringed ends of the rods described by Gren-
ACHER (6). I find, in a transverse section cutting an adult ocellus in a plane parallel to
the surface, that I get the same appearance as GRENACHER described ; in fact, his figure
would serve for an exact representation of my section, but I believe this appearance,
which I do not get in similar sections through earlier stages, is due to the action of
reagents. At no stage of the development could I see anything like an axial fibre in
the retinal cells of the ocelli. The cells of the exterior wall become flat rather than round, and their nuclei become
very faint during the latter part of their development.
