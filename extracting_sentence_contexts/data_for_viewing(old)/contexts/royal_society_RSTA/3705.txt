In uniaxial compression, the result (1.1) applies both at the onset of instability and far ne]
beyond it. However, in other scenarios, the behaviour of the system changes qualitatively beyond DN
onset. For example, attempts to determine the location of wrinkles based on determining where [a
compression would occur ordinarily under-predict the wrinkle extent dramatically [14,16,17]. It 1&8
is now well known that to correctly predict the location of wrinkles it is necessary to account .
for the fact that wrinkling relaxes the compressive stress that caused instability in the first place
[18,19]—what is usually referred to as tension-field theory [20] or the relaxed energy approach
[21]. However, an understanding of how this stress relaxation affects the wrinkle wavelength has
only come more recently [15,22,23]. In particular, Cerda & Mahadevan [15] showed that tension
along the direction of the wrinkles gives rise to an effective ‘tensional’ stiffness, Ktens, that may be
substituted into (1.1) in place of K. Generalizing this work, Paulsen et al. [23] recently showed that
curvature along the wrinkle direction can also give rise to a ‘curvature-induced’ stiffness, Keury.

In this paper, we give a new perspective on wrinkling ‘Far from threshold’ (FT) for the
indentation-induced wrinkling of a pressurized elastic shell [17,18]. We use both asymptotic
analysis of the shallow shell equations, together with ABAQUS simulations. In particular, we
perform the FT expansion [22] by exploiting the large number of wrinkles, m>>1, that are
frequently observed in such scenarios, and determine results for the wrinkle number mi as the
