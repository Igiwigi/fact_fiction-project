lapse of time. This was done with a reading telescope, fitted with a Hilger
micrometer eye-piece. The two methods yielded concordant results which were
checked at a later date by a large number of similar measurements made with a
cathetometer. In fig. 7, volume change in cubic millimetres is plotted against the
time, in hours, during which the bulb had been in ice, and the resulting curve
indicates that nearly three hours were required to establish temperature equilibrium.*

Now each complete determination occupied from twelve to fifteen hours and was
carried through in two consecutive days. The normal procedure was to measure and

* The unexpectedly long time taken by the gas to attain temperature equilibrium may haye been due
to the fact that the base of the bulb was supported by a small rubber cork which protected the glass over
a small area from direct contact with the ice.


THE COMBINING VOLUMES OF HYDROGEN AND OXYGEN. 417

combine the gases on the first day and leave the wet hydrogen residue safely
imprisoned between mercury surfaces in the explosion vessel over night. The
residual hydrogen was measured on the following day. The order of operations at
the beginning of each day was identical. First of all the pipette was cooled with ice ;
then hydrogen was admitted, the upper bath iced and a setting made. During the
rest of the day the ice in the pipette bath was never removed, but was pressed down
and replenished immediately before each reading. On the second day, as soon as the
