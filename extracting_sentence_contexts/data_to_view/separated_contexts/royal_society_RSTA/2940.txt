and P. A. further valuable
result is that it enables us to give the limits of possible variation of A, p, @, @g., in
the example above cited by putting p= —q=r= +1. The utmost possible, though
unlikely, variations are then +3°18 for A, #°005155 for p, and +°013846 for a.
When in the following pages limits of this kind are given, it will be understood that
they have been arrived at in the above manner. We shall have to apply certain laws and relationships already known, and it | is
necessary to have some clear idea of the degree of exactness with which they represent
facts. Some of these depend on direct observation, others on relationships arising
from the formule. Of the former the most important relate to the doublet (v) and
triplet (v%, v2) separations of the various series.
