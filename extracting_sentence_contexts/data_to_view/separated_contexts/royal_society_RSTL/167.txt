This arrange-
ment of muscular fibres, differs from that of the elephant,
where the central part is tendinous. The muscular fibres
have a membranous-lining between them and the cavity of
the tympanum,

From this description of the membrana tympani, it is evi-
dent that there is no connexion between it and the ossicula
auditiis, or small bones, of the ear, which Mr. HunTer sup-
posed to be the case in consequence of having found that it
was $0 in the porpoise.* He says, © in the piked whale the
* membrana tympani is projecting, and returns back into the
« meatus externus for above an inch in length, is firm in tex-
& ture, with thick coats, is hollow on the inside, and its mouth
« communicating with the tympanum, one side being fixed to
« the malleus, similar to the tendinous process which goes from
« the inside of the membrana tympani in the others.”

The fact is, that there is no connexion whatever between
the membrana tympani and the malleus, as will be explained;
but as that circumstance forms the great peculiarity in the
organ of this species of whale, I thought it right to quote what
he had $tated on this subject. Having pointed out that there is no direct connexion be=
tween the membrana tympani and the ossicula audittis, as in
