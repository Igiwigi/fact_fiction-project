BRobie on the influence of the Nerves, &c. 10g

But this, with respect to the greater number of the glands, is
an experiment impossible to perform ; and, with respect to
others, can not be executed without s0 much disturbance and
injury to the other parts, as must render it extremely difficult
to arrive at any positive results. Perhaps in future investi-
gations, some circumstances may arise, which will enable us to
determine more satisfactorily this important physiological ques-
tion. In the mean time, as the labours of physiologists have
hitherto contributed s0 little to this purpose, any facts that
tend to its elucidation may deserve to be recorded, and I am
therefore induced to lay before the Society the following ex-
periments, which afford one example of a secretion_ being
dependent on the influence of the nerves. The stomach derives its nerves principally from those of
the eighth pair, or the par vagum ;- and the same nerves, as
they assist in the formation of the semilunar ganglions, con-
tribute to the supply of the rest of the alimentary canal, par-
ticularly of the small intestines, In an inquiry which I had
formerly instituted, respecting the functions of the stomach,
I divided these nerves in the neck of a dog, for the purpose
of ascertaining the influence which they possess on the secre-
tion of the gastric juice; but I was disappointed in my expec-
tation, 8ince the animals always died, in consequence of the
disturbed state of the respiration, which the injury of the
nerves occasioned, before there was an opportunity of ascer-
taining the eftect produced on the process of digestion,

Thad formerly ascertained, that in a dog poisoned by arsenic,
there is a copious 'secretion of mucous and watery fluid from
the mucous membrane of the stomach- and- intestines, which
are in consequence found after death completely. and preter-

naturally distended ; and it occurred to me, that although I
could not ascertain the effect of the division of the nerves
of the eighth pair on the natural secretions of the stomach, it
might be possible to ascertain the effect on a secretion thus
artificially produced, With this view I instituted the following
experiments.
