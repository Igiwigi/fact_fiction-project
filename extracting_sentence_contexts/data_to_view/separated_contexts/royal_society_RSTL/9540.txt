GoLpsTEIN and CRooKEs have shown that it arises from streams of
molecules or small particles of some kind which pour off from the negative terminal |
during the continuance of the discharge. These while moving ab high velocities striko
against the glass and by their impact impart sufficient energy to the glass to render it
luminous, and also to raise its temperature very considerably. The peculiar colour of
the light thus generated has been conclusively shown to depend solely on the coy
position of the glass; it is indifferent to the 8nbstance of which the terminal is
composed ; in fact, as will be seen later, the very glass itself may serve as guch a
terminal. Tts configuration: undoubtedly depends upon that of the terminal as well
as upon that, of the surface of the glass upon which it is actually formed ; but as thy
phosphorescent light has no direct connexion with the luminosity of the gas i
gives us no direct information as to what is going on within the tube, save 80 far as
testifies to the existence of these streams of material particles coming from the
negative terminal. Tho relation of this to other electrical phenomena seems not to have been clearly
understood, and it has been supposed by some to indicate that the gas within bs
tube js in some special and peculiar state differing widely from the ordinary gaseous
