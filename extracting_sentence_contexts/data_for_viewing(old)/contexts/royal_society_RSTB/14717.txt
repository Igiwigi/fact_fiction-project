such as dynamic random-dot stereograms, where there is
no monocular temporal difference between target and
background, as humans and monkeys do.

4. Discussion lobe independently selects the most attractive object visible
In this paper, I first discussed stereopsis as it is generally to the ipsilateral eye [6]. This monocular selection cannot
understood in the psychology and computing literature. Its account for the bias to select the stereoscopically closer of

aim is to achieve binocular single vision and a detailed map two otherwise identical targets (figure 12).

stereopsis represent my current best guess rather than a well-evidenced fact.
