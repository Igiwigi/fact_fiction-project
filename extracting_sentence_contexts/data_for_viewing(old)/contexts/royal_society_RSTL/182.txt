These are always imaginary expressions when e 7 1 and 7
odd. In fact, R, in the hyperbola, must be written

Met— J Vi_e

now Ve—1=e. = Thus, this expression, like the rest,

is easIly transformed, in functions of a, x, a, the x is now real,
and the part involving a will always be of the form f(a" +a),
and therefore readily expressed in trigonometrical functions.

Before we proceed farther, it will be necessary to premise
