Hugh Dixson regarded the same specimens as comparable with the variety
“grown in the Eastern Seas and China, of which the best is Manila tobacco’. This
‘variety’ is acknowledged by botanists as being N. tabacum. Lewis, relying upon the data then available, says (1924, p. 10) : ‘Altogether the facts
seem to point to an ancient use of an indigenous New Guinea species of tobacco prob-

ably closely related to the Australian species.’ He stated later (1931a, p. 136): ‘The
Dutch expeditions of recent years have apparently found what they regard as N.
tabacum in the Dutch territory... . This did not seem to me conclusive evidence for the
whole of New Guinea.’ Lewis was not then acquainted with Gilmour’s investigations,
which as I point out on pp. 234—5 cover widely separated areas in Papua and the Man-
dated Territory of New Guinea, and also Rabaul in New Britain. This investigation
confirms the conclusions of Dutch botanists for Netherlands New Guinea and renders
it improbable that there is an indigenous species of tobacco in New Guinea allied to or
identical with N. suaveolens.
