From these data we find that the amount of heat developed per minute in the coil
will be 055 unit. If we suppose all this heat to be retained, the rise of temperature will be '015* OC.
per 1', and the increase of resistance 0000045 B.A. unit, and this will be too s8mall tc
aftect our results. As a matter of fact, it is clearly impossible for all the heat to remain
in the coil, and the correction is, @ fortiori, too 8mall to be considered,

During the second series of experiments a hole was bored in the brass case of the
coil and a thermometer inserted. The thermometer agreed throughout in its readings
with that in the water bath in which the coil was immersed. Thus we conclude as the final result of this series of experiments that the value of
the B.A. unit is *98635 ohm.
