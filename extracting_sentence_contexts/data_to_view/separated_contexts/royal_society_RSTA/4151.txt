The
orientation of the elements would remain uniform throughout the mass of one grain,
however much the outline of that grain were distorted by slips occurring within it. In other words, the erystalline structure of a metal should survive even the severest
strain. This conclusion is borne out by the fact that in metals which have been much
strained we find evidence of crystalline structure similar to that which is found in
unstrained metal. Taking this evidence in the same order as before, we would refer first to the
appearance which is presented in severely strained metal, by a polished and etched
section when seen under oblique light. We have examined a bar of fine Swedish
iron (kindly supplied by Messrs. EpGar ALLEN and Co.), which had been for the
purpose of these experiments rolled in the cold state from a diameter of three-quarters
of an inch to a diameter of half an inch, and had not been subsequently heated.
