We say that the uncertainty can be very deep. The
pure state representation means that maximal information (about the context) is encoded in it. The most tricky point of quantum information theory (and, in fact, quantum theory in general)
is that there exist states of compound systems, e.g. ‘agent+tenvironment’, which are pure. This
means they encode maximal information, but the states of subsystems, e.g. the state of the agent,

“This approach was used for a wide class of problems in DM, psychology, politics and biology [14-17,32,38].

5 Another complication is that it is impossible to represent the quantum adaptive dynamics as dynamics of pure states. The
impact of the environment can transfer a pure initial state into a mixed quantum state (represented by a density operator).
