The apparatus was then left to itself for 30 or 40 minutes, which interval
= was as a rule sufficiently long to allow the hygrometric state to become constant.
- The hygrometer index rose at first rapidly and afterwards more lowly to a limiting
2£ position which it steadily maintained. On one occasion the indication was observed
bt at intervals during 36 hours, and did not vary more than a tenth of a scale division. S The new apparatus has, in fact, enabled us to overcome the chief difficulties encountered
E with the old. We can now maintain the temperature and hygrometric state of the
E space round the film constant as long as we wish. To proceed :—The electrical

connexions having been completed, the lower ring F was turned to one side by the
button H, and the pinion C rotated until the mouth of the upper cup jusb touched
the liquid.
