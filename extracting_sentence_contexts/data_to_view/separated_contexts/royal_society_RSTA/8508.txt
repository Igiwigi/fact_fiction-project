R. A. FISHER ON THE MATHEMATICAL

the data is usually far greater than the number of facts sought, much of the information
supplied by any actual sample is irrelevant. It is the object of the statistical processes
employed in the reduction of data to exclude this irrelevant information, and to isolate
the whole of the relevant information contained in the data. When we speak of the probability of a certain object fulfilling a certain condition, we
imagine all such objects to be divided into two classes, according as they do or do not
fulfil the condition.
