To the distinct gains observed in the experiments in
closed vessels no such objection can however be raised ; whilst the negative results in
the sterilised soils constitute another element in favour of the conclusion at which
M. Berruetor has arrived. It is, however, one thing to accept experimental results on the authority of
M. Berruecor, and another to adopt his arguments and conclusions in the application
of them to the conditions of practical agriculture. To avoid repetition, however,
further reference to this part of the subject must be postponed until the results and
conclusions of other experimenters have been considered ; for, to a great extent, the
same facts and arguments are applicable in reference to them, as to M. BerrHexorâ€™s
results and conclusions. 2. The Experiments of M. P. P. Denurarn.
