which is one of the terms in MAXwE t's equation of electromotive force. As for e,
it includes not merely the force of intrinsic electrification, the analogue of intrinsic
magnetisation, but also the sources of energy, voltaic force, thermoelectric force, &e.

(89) and (90) are thus the working equations, with (88) and (91) in case the
medium moves; along with the linear relations before mentioned, and the definitions
of energy and waste of energy per unit volume. The fictitious K and o are useful in
symmetrizing the equations, if for no other purpose. Another way of writing the two equations of curl is by removing the e and h
terms to the right side. Let

curl h = j, J+j=Hh, (92)
— curl e = g, G+g=G,.{
