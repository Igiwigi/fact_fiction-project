The circle in question (which may be called the dirigent circle)
has for its equation
a+ +Yab+ac+ad+be+bd+ed)=0. The line in question, which may be called the directrix, has for its equation

= Considering the equation of the Cartesian under the form

= (a+#—&z) +16A(z—m)=0,

the centre of the dirigent circle z*+y*—«=0 must be considered as a real point, but «
Zmay be positive or negative, #. e. the radius may be either a real or a pure imaginary
Sdistance : the coefficients A, m must be real, the directrix is therefore a real line. The
Zequation shows that for all points of the curve z—m is always negative or always positive,
Saccording as A is positive or negative, 7. e. that the curve lies wholly on one side of the
Edirectrix, viz. on the same side with the centre of the dirigent circle if A is positive, but,
=on the contrary side if A is negative. In the former case the curve may be said to be an
Z*inside* curve, in the latter an © outside* curve.
