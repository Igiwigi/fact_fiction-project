Typically
the nerve cells lie clear of the layer of nerve fibres, which do not make direct contact with
cell bodies. This epithelial position of the neurones may possibly be a primitive character,
but may equally well be neotenous, since vertebrate neuroblasts develop from neuro-
epithelial cells. The fact that a cell may occur deep in the nerve-fibre layer as an abnor-
mality, and then appears to receive synaptic connexions from neighbouring axons, would
agree with the view that the usual condition is neotenous.

(c) Collar epidermis

The five zones into which the collar epidermis is divided, as in other Enteropneusta,
are outlined in figure 7. The first zone has a comparatively thin epithelium and contains
few gland cells (none in its posterior border). Abundant mucus cells are present in the
third and fourth zones, and many elongated mulberry cells lie near the surface of the
epithelium in the third zone and towards the posterior end of the second zone.
