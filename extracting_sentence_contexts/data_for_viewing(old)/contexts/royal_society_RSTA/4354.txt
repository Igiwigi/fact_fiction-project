the last decade, have probed an isolated line of a molecular species. In this respect, advantages
and limitations of the main experiments have been highlighted, also making a thoughtful
comparison among the different molecules. As a result, it seems clear that non-polar molecules,
possibly having strong absorption features in the NIR, should be preferred for many reasons:


collisions are less effective; the refractive index is smaller; moleculesâ€™ adsorption and desorption
from the cell walls are strongly reduced. This latter feature, in particular, makes it possible to
perform spectral averaging over long times, thus increasing the signal-to-noise ratio without
the risk of line distortion caused by a pressure variation arising from the interaction with
the cell.

There exists a line shape problem due to the fact that fully ab initio line shape calculations
are prohibitively complex for self-colliding molecules. Approximations and simplifications are
necessary for the construction of those models that have been mentioned in this article. In
the kinetic theory of spectral profiles, in addition to the standard binary collision and impact
approximations, there is the assumption that the translation motion can be treated classically
[82]. Furthermore, the active molecules (interacting with the electromagnetic field, which is
treated classically) are diluted in a bath of structureless perturbers [82]. Therefore, even though
a given line shape model is successful in reproducing a high-quality experimental spectrum, the : =

interpretation of some parameters can be problematic, mainly because of statistical correlations Sy
among multiple fitted parameters. This is the case, for instance, of Dicke narrowing and speed- a
dependent broadening parameters in SDGP and SDHCP models. Fortunately, this issue can be aed
significantly reduced by using the global fitting approach for a manifold of spectra, across a 22
