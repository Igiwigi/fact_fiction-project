For
example, both maximum-likelihood estimation and penalized approaches like the lasso are non-Bayesian, but, in contrast
to confidence intervals and p-values, not inherently frequentist. Of course, one may study the frequency properties of these
procedures, but one may also study the frequency properties of Bayesian methods.


(a) Population structure and clustering

The first example is my work on so-called ‘admixture models’ to infer population structure
from genetic data [32]. In brief, population structure refers to the fact that some individuals
are more genetically similar than others. Thus, a typical first attempt to investigate population
structure might involve applying some kind of clustering method to the genetic data. The main
contribution of [32] was to extend a standard model-based cluster model to allow that each
individual could have partial membership in each cluster; that is, in the language of population
genetics, to allow that individuals may be ‘admixed’.
