In close connection with these experiments stand certain results obtained by Morr
and SHERRINGTON. * These authors determined that, after a unilateral section of all
the posterior roots of the brachial plexus has been made in the monkey, the limb is
paralysed in so far as no â€œ
Nevertheless the limb reacted to cortical excitation, and in fact the arm area was, if
anything, hyper-excitable. The limb is, we may suppose, paralysed because the
spatial sensations which come from the limb no longer stream into the association
field formed by the cortex cerebri. The animal forgets that it has the limb.
