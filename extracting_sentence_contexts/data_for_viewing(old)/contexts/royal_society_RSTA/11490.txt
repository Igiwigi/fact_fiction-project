was found to have gained 0:0048 gr.

The difference between the losses and gains being, therefore, +0°0016 gr.

A repetition of the experiment with a slow air current gave a difference of
-—0°0003 gr.

* There are three plausible explanations of the phenomenon: (1) That there are eddy currents (possibly
caused by inequalities of surface) in the junction tube and the consequent changes of temperature bring
about deposition ; in this connection it is noteworthy that more moisture is deposited on a dirty tube.
(2) That the surface of any glass vessel is always slightly hydrated, and if the glass be soluble a solution
of lower vapour pressure is formed, and, consequently, more moisture is deposited ; evidence in favour of
this view is afforded by the well-known fact that less moisture is deposited on lead glass, which is stated to
be less soluble than soda glass; on the other hand, we find that we get the usual deposit on platinum-
iridium tubes. (3) That the air, containing ions, is really supersaturated in as far as the ions may carry a
watery envelope ; the latter is deposited on the walls of the tube where the ions come in contact with it.
We are at present engaged in experiments to test this hypothesis.
