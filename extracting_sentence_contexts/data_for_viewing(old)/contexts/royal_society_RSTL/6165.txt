47. The data for turning the deflections in the third column into the thermal effects
-Zin the fourth, were obtained by immersing the rubber, to a point above the place where
the thermo-electric junction was inserted, in water of different temperatures,

5 48. These experiments developed the following facts :—lIst. That the effect of laying
Zon the weights was not sensibly different in quantity from the reyerse effect of removing
them. 2nd. That with light weights and a low temperature there was a slight cooling
geffect on the application of tensile force, which, first increasing with the weights laid on.
Sultimately changed into a heating effect, increasing much more rapidly than the stretch-
Ling weight.

2 49. The temperature of the thong during the experiments was 7*:8, I found that at
Ztemperatures a few degrees higher, the reverse action with weak tensile forces did not
Rtake place, but that there was, on the contrary, a very slight heating effect.

50. Professor 'Tnoxs0N suggesting to me that in those circumstances in which the
rubber was heated by being stretched, it would contract its length under tension when
