be K-sparse. A K-sparse constraint thus restricts elements to lie on one of several subspaces. The ae

set of all K-sparse vectors is thus a union of subspaces. eae
For an arbitrary vector x, calculation of the K-sparse approximation Xx with the smallest least- 7

squares error can be done extremely efficiently. All that is required is to sort the entries in x Dy

by decreasing magnitude and set all but the K largest elements of x to zero. We will call the aS

calculation of the best K-sparse approximation of a vector a projection of the vector onto the union 1S

of subspaces. ,
The power of sparsity constraints comes from the fact that they are not restricted to the

canonical basis, but that we can restrict coefficients in any basis. By carefully choosing the right

basis, we are thus often able to model and constrain different characteristics of x. For example, for

our tomographic X-ray problem, wavelet bases can provide good sparse models. Let @ be a basis

matrix and define s such that x = ®s. We then say that x is sparse in the basis © ifs is sparse. If ® is

orthonormal, then it is again easy to commute the best K-sparse approximation of x in the basis ®.

This is done by calculating s = 7x, which is then again thresholded by keeping only the K largest
