See https://en.wikipedia.org /wiki/Humber_Bridge). Opened in 1981, the Humber Bridge is
much longer and is constructed at a slightly more exposed coastal site, so we might expect
comparable but slightly higher extreme wind speeds there. The standard CP3 [5] recommends
the use of the 1 in 50-year value for design; however, it also provides some information for other
return periods. Increasing the wind estimates for the transporter bridges to bracket the Humber
Bridge deck value raises the associated return period from 50 to 200 years. Further statistical
analysis of extreme winds and dynamic structural analysis to account for the 3s gust value, of
particular relevance for the Newport Bridge, would be warranted but is not attempted here.

Returning to the transporter bridges, in the second wind load case, when the analysis is
extended to include the gondola and live load, reduced wind loads are adopted in recognition
of the fact that, in practice, bridge operations are ceased if the wind speed exceeds a much
