Pigs, in which it is raised into a very slight eminence. The inner margin of the humeral
extremity (fig. 4, Ãž) is produced a little downwards, but, much less 80 than in Anoplo-
therium. The supinator ridge is not prominent, though its rugose Surface testifies to
the attachment of strong muscles. There is a very large intercondyloid perforation (ec),
into which the olecranon entered deeply, as in modern wild hogs. The breadth of the
articular surface is very great comparatively to the transverse diameter of the whole
distal extremity of the humerus. The humerus figured in Plate XXXVI. fig. 4 belonged
to the didactyle form, Diplopus Aymards; it is from Hordwell: besides this humerus I
had many specimens from Puy and Hempstead; and as the two genera are confined to
their respective localities, the Diplopus to Hordwell and the Zyopotamus to Puy and
Hempstead, there is no danger of intermixing their fossil remains. The humeri of
different size, which belonged to the tetradactyle 7/yopotamus, are entirely similar to
the one figured; the only difference which may be noticed consists in the fact that the
distal articular surface is relatively larger in the Diplopus than in Hyopotamus, as seen
by the fact that in the three humeri of nearly equal size measured by me, the breadth of
the articular surface is 42 millims. in Diplopus, and only 32 and 35 in two humeri of
Hyopotamus.
