of arid vitriol of zinc ; a deficiency of about 4£., occa-
sioned probably by some small inaccuracy of manipulation. 2. When the simplicity found in all those parts of nature
which are sufficiently known to discover it is considered, it
appears improbable that the proximate constituent parts of
bodies should be united in them, in the very remote relations to
each other in which analyses generally indicate them ; and, an
attention to the subject has led me to the opinion that such is
in fact not the case, but that, on the contrary, they are univer-
sally, as appears here with respect to arid vitriol of zinc, fractions
of the compound of very low denominators. Possibly in few
cases exceeding five. The success which has appeared to attend some attempts to
apply this theory, and amongst others, to the compositions of
some of the substances above analysed, and especially to the
calamine from Bleyberg, induces me to venture to dwell here
a little on this subject, and state the composition of this cala-
mine which results from the system, as, besides contributing
perhaps to throw some light on the true nature of this ore, it
may be the means likewise of presenting the theory under cir-
cumstances of agreement with experiment, which, from the
surprising degree of nearness, and the trying complexity of the
case, may seem to entitle it to some attention.
