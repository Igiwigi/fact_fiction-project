1. The fact that there is a dynamical mechanism involved often increases substantially 1a
the intensity of extreme events compared with rare events caused by a purely random
process. This is manifested by the heavy tail characteristics of the corresponding
probability distribution.

2. Extreme events are usually associated with complex tails in the PDF. This complexity
reflects the fact that there is an underlying dynamical mechanism having the form of
nonlinear energy transfer, which may not act uniformly for all intensities of the extreme
event. For example, in an energy conserving system, such as nonlinear waves, although
instabilities can lead to extreme events, these cannot obtain arbitrarily large magnitudes
due to finite energy. Therefore, although nonlinearity can induce spatially localized
extremes, which are reflected as heavy-tailed regimes in the PDE, the latter have bounded
extent because of bounded energy. See figure 1b for an example.

3. Extreme events are often associated with a specific time scale over which they develop.
This time scale is imposed by the Lyapunov exponent of the associated instability,
the time scale related to the nonlinear energy transfer. By identifying the nature of
the instability, one can track the corresponding Laypunov exponent and use this as a
precursor for the upcoming extreme event. Therefore, for extreme events one may be
