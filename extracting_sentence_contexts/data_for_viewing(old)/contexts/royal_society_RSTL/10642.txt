The temporary hemiopia to the left side is readily explicable by the lesions of the
cortex and medullary fibres of the occipito-angular region. The very evident impair-
ment of tactile sensibility of the left side—sensibility to mere contact being apparently
completely abolished during the firs two or three days, and deficiency being still
observable for a whole fortnight after the operation—would seem to be in direct
relation to the injury of the hippocampus and its medullary fibres, as this was the
only lesion beside that of the medullary fibres of the posterior lobe.

The more extensive destruction of the hippocampal region in the left hemisphere
Vas as80ciated with a more prolonged impairment of tactile sensibility on the right,
Yde, though from the first this was not abolizhed. There was also temporary impair-
ZAent or abolition of hearing on the right, a fact which receives its explanation in the
KHjury inflicted on the medullary fibres of the superior temporo-sphenoidal convolution.
& The lesion of the occipito-angular region reinduced for a time the impaired vision
Swards the left which had resulted from the lesion in the right hemisphere, but which
Fd been recovered from ; but the persistenb right hemiopia was evidently due, as had
#en diagnosed during life, to the lesion of the left optic tract.
iZ In consequence of this lesion there was atrophy of the brachium and anterior

bercle of the corpora quadrigemina on the left side, and atrophy of the right optic

rve. This showed itself during life in well-marked atrophy of the outer sector of
Hoth optic discs.
