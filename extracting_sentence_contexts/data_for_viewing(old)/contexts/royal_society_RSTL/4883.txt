moves eastward in early morning up to 19%, and that is just the hour when the mini-
mum intensity occurs. From 18" or 19* to 21" the intensity rises to a maximum,
precisely as the lines of force are moving westward before the sun region, prior to
their quick return east; and as they return in their quick journey $0 the intensity
falls to a minimum again, and is at that minimum at 1* or 2", just as the swing is
over. Here is a very close connexion, and it is curious to see the needle end at east
with minimum power at 18", and again also at 1", remembering that in that time it
has swung from east to west and back to east again.

3045. St .Helena* —This is a station which Colonel Sapixg has distinguished as of
the highest interest ; being near the line of least force, within the tropics, and with
little magnetic inclination. It was here also that he called attention to the striking
fact, that the course of the needle is in some months in one direction, and in other
months in the contrary for the same hours of the day}. Ds 14a Rivs attempted to
explain this facth, but SapINE has stated that this explanation is not satisfactory©.

3046. St. Helena being a 8mall island in the south Atlantic ocean is removed about
1200 miles from the nearest land. The longitude is 5* 40' west, the latitude 15% 56'
south ; the mean declination 23* 30' west, and the mean dip 22* south. Hence there
are three quadrants concerned in the day action of the sun, especially when that
luminary is south of the equator. The sun is south of St. Helena itself in the months
