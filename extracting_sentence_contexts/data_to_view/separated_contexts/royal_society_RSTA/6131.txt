There is however another type of singularity classification that is based on the work of
Choquet-Bruhat and stems from theorems giving sufficient conditions for causal g-completeness,
that is necessary conditions for the development of cosmological singularities (cf. [141], [142, ch.
8]). This leads directly to a complete dynamical classification for isotropic cosmologies into many
distinct types [143,144]. In fact, there are four types of this classification that are found to play
an important role in current models, as they appear commonly in dark energy universes with
phantom fluids [145]. This leads to a ‘zoo’ of cosmological singularities developing in finite time into the future,
already in the isotropic category, to say nothing about possibilities in more general homogeneous
universes. These singularities include not only the traditional ones discussed earlier (big bang
and big crunch) but many other types, such as big rips, sudden singularities, or very mild soft
ones, turnarounds, etc. (see [146] for a brief review).
