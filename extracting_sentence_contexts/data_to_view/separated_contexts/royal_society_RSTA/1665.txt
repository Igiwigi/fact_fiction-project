We can therefore take the average height of the tide along the section from
Kumpei to Penang to be 110 cm., and the average current when flowing strongest to
be 2 knots, reaching its maximum half an hour before high water. The average
depth is about 30 fathoms. A modification must be made in the previous procedure
to allow for the fact that the current flows along the strait, which is not quite at
right angles to the line of the section ; therefore, in finding the energy crossing the
section, we must take for the length of the section, not the distance from Kumpei to
Penang, but the projection of this on a line perpendicular to the strait, which is
230 km. The flux of energy is hence found to be, on an average, 7x10" ergs per
second. We also require the amount of this energy that emerges through the narrow
part of the strait.
