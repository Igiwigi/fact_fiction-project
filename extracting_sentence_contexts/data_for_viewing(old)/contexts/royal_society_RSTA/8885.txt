however, been shown to be at least 0-12 volt outside the possible limits for the true
zero as determined by the photo-electric data, and it may quite well be out by as much
as half a volt. In that case curve I. would have to come up from the volt axis at about
1-5 volts instead of at 1 volt, which would have made the curve show a much stronger
resemblance to curve III. The position of the true zero for the chlorine data plotted
in curve II. is still more doubtful. These curves illustrate well the difficulties involved
in the analysis of the energy distribution unless the position of the zero is correctly
known.

In fig. 18, which refers to the data for COCI, with the cylindrical electrode, the position
of the actual zero is known to within 0-10 volt, and it is obvious that these experimental
points (marked thus ©) show a much closer resemblance to the requirements of the
Maxwell distribution. The crosses in this figure do, in fact, represent a Maxwell dis-
tribution for the temperature TT = 3600°K, and the same range dV = 0-20 volt as the
experimental points deduced from fig. 12, and the full curve is drawn to meet the theo-
retical points. It will be seen that the points given by the experiments are very close
to the theoretical curve, and, in fact, the agreement is as close as could be expected,
except in the immediate neighbourhood of the maximum. As has been explained
already, there are disturbing causes which are likely to produce deviations in this region,
and these deviations should be in the direction indicated by the discrepancy shown
by the diagram. It should be pointed out that the only quantity which can be arbi-
trarily varied in fitting the theoretical curve to the experimental points is the single
parameter T. The only other variable entering is the stretch dV, which is already
fixed by the way in which the experimental points are reduced from the observational
data. Given T and dV, the value of the ordinate for any particular value of V is deter-
