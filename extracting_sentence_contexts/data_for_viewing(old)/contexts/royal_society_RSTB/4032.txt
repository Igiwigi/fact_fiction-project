up-hill became progressively easier. We also seemed to be much less affected by
muscular exertion than the people who came up, and used to pull some of the more
helpless ones up the last steep part of the track.

VI. Periodic Breathing.

The fact that at high altitudes the breathing tends to become periodic or of the
“ Cheyne-Stokes” type was discovered by Mosso, who made many valuable observa-
tions on the subject, and published a number of tracings.* Unfortunately, he was led
to very mistaken conclusions as to the cause of nearly all of the peculiar respiratory
phenomena met with at high altitudes.

Periodic breathing appeared at one time or another in all of us. In HENDERSON it
was constantly present during sleep to the end of our stay, and often during the
waking hours, particularly in the first days. In Hatpane it was often present, and
in Doveras not so often, during the day for the first few days ; in SCHNEIDER it was
only once observed, six days after our arrival. Except in Henprrson, it was not
observed during sleep. On the whole, its appearance became much less frequent as
we became acclimatised. Curiously enough, it re-appeared in Dovenas, who had been
