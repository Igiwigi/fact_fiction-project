distance from the atomic boundary than are the circular currents which give rise to the magnetic
properties. As the intensity of the magnetic field due to a circular current varies inversely as the cube of
the distance, and as in a crystalline structure two such circuits may approach so as almost to touch, each
electron describing a small circle, the local magnetic forcive may be sufficiently large to account for the facts.

The view that the cohesive force in crystalline media is of a magnetic nature was expressed in Part II.
of this research, pp. 83-86. It was there stated that in a diamagnetic crystalline medium the molecules
are held together by the local magnetic forces due to the revolving electrons. It is possible that each
electron is completely bound to its own nucleus by a narrow tube of force, when the molecules would be
capable of attracting or repelling one another electromagnetically according to their directions of rotation,
The advantage of an electromagnetic cohesive force lies in the fact that by it-we can readily see how
similar molecules will cling together. Electrostatically such attraction implies an electron transfer
which, we know, does not always take place, Reasons are given on p. 277 that the atomic forces which
determine the structure of the molecule are in part at least of a magnetic nature. The adyantage of

The theory propounded by TYNDALL was called by him the “theory of reciprocal
induction,” and the direction within the crystalline medium where the molecules had
the closest proximity and along which the greatest energy was displayed, he called the
“line of elective polarity.” This theory is identical with our hypothesis of mutual
molecular distortion enunciated at the beginning of Part I. and subsequently confirmed
