both from measurements made on a portion of the film by the electrometer, and also
from the resistance of the whole length measured by WaraTsroN®'s bridge. To effect
this, the thicknesses at top and bottom, and, if necessary, at intermediate points, were
measured.

These observations confirmed our opinion of the superiority of the electrometer

method. Results were sometimes obtained agreeing to about 0:5 per cent,, but
generally the difference was greater, and sometimes it was as large as 6 per cent. The
fact that the most discordant results were obtained with films which had exhibited
a considerable number of black specks ab the top shows the advantage of working
in the middle of the film. We may here remark that the effect of these black specks
upon the electrometer was carefully noted. They generally travelled round the film
ab varying speeds, and it was found that a gpeck much larger than was usnal was
required to produce any effect on the electrometer by its passage over the nearest
needle,

Observations with three Flectrometers.—Tt may be desirable to state why three
needles were used for the films rather than two. The object in view was twofold. In
the firs place, when a film begins to thin, it often happens that its upper part, the
region between needles 1 and 2, shows recognizable colours, and is in a fit condition
for observation and measurement, before the colours of the region between needles
