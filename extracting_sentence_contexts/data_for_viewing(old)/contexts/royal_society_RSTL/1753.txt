The differences in the weight of adhesive air appear, at first sight, very ano-
malous : especially when we consider that the vibrating specific gravity of the
mass, and the weight of the pendulum, are exactly alike in each case. But, it
should be remembered that these weights of adhesive air are supposed, by the
formula in page 431, to be applied to the centre of gyration: and, if we wish
to determine the effect due to the disc alone, we must, have recourse to the for-
mula in page 440. It is in this manner that I have obtained the results given
in the last column of the preceding Table, under the head of © Weight due to
the disc alone.” The mean of the last three values gives the weight of air due
to the disc alone, equal to 1387 grain. I have not included the case where
the disc was only 5:1 inches from the knife edge; since no dependence can be
placed on the result, on account of the magnitude of the multiplier. In fact,
if the weight of adhesive air at that point of the rod, were only 1-466 instead
of 1-523, the weight due to the disc alone would correspond with the mean of
the rest.

As I was desirous of varying these experiments as much as possible, I next
tried the effect of two of the thinnest of the cylinders above mentioned (having
the same diameter as the disc used in the preceding set of experiments), whose
thickness was respectively 0'18, and 0:50 inch: in order to see whether they
would exhibit the same law. The cylinders were screwed to the end of the
long brass rod; and 8wung, as in the preceding set, with their flat sides
oppoxsed to the line of motion. The following are the results :
