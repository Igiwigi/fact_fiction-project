The velum
of Lepidocarpon and that of Miadesmia agree in both enclosing the ligule. In Iso√©tes
the opening is proximal, in Lepidocarpon radially extended, in Miadesmia it is distal. In fact, the velum differs so much in these three cases that we are compelled to regard
each as of independent origin. This rather surprising conclusion points to there
having been a widespread tendency to vary towards seed formation in the Paleozoic
era. Lepidocarpon and possibly Miadesmia date back to the Lower Carboniferous flora.
