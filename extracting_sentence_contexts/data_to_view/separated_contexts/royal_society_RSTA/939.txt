+ The time signal was used because it came at a convenient time. It was treated just like a Morse
signal in the reductions, and no use was made of the fact that it was a time signal. 450 E. C. BULLARD

For the smooth working of the method it is essential that the observer should be
able absolutely to rely on the records at the Base station being satisfactory ; for by
the time he hears of a failure there, he will probably have travelled so far from the
station where he was when the failure occurred, that it will be impossible to repeat
the observation. The Base observations were in charge of Sir GERALD LENOX-
Conyncuam, F.R.S., and were carried out by him, by Mr. Munsey of St. Johnâ€™s
College, and by Mr. Fiavini of the Department of Geodesy and Geophysics.
