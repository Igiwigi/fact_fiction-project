the same table, the values of y and 6p reported from static measurements [22] and dynamic
measurements [19] are also shown for comparison. The results of our fit are summarized in
figure 4 and table 1. We fixed the ambient pressure parameters yg and 09 obtained from ambient
pressure measurements [2,22,26] and refined the parameter q. For details about the error analysis
and the mathematical details of the fitting algorithm, see the attached supplementary materials.
The data used in the fit are also listed in the electronic supplementary material [23].

A parametrized conventional isothermal EOS fit was also made by assuming an ambient
pressure thermal expansion parameter @, and a temperature dependence of the bulk modulus
dK/dT [27]. Although such a fit is unphysical (especially in cases where the dK/dT contribution
can change drastically due to some elastic relaxation, as is certainly expected in ByC and materials
where dK/dP can deviate appreciably from an empirical value of 4, again shown by B,C).
The ease of such a parametric description of the P-V-T behaviour lies in the fact that a ready
estimate of K(P, T) can be made as input into other measurements such as Brillouin scattering
or ultrasonic measurements for sound velocity measurements. These parameters are listed in
table 2 and the fit is summarized in figure 5. The fit to the whole dataset was performed using
EoSFit7c [18].


Table 1. Parameters from the MGD fit of the P-V-T data of ByC. The full data in the pressure range 8-50 GPa and 300-2500 K
were fitted using a weighted chi-squared minimization (for details, see the electronic supplementary material [23]). The result
of this fit is displayed in figure 4.
