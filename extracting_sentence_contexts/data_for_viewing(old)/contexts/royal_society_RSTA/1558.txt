corresponds to the noise level used in figure 4b to obtain qualitatively the best image perception.
Usually, the optimal performances of the system are strongly affected by the threshold of the
detector. Especially, the gap between the subthreshold information signal and the threshold
significantly affects the optimal performance that can be achieved by the system with the help of
noise. To illustrate this feature, we have also plotted in figure 5a the cross-covariance for two other
values of the threshold Vth, namely Vth = 1.05 plotted with circles and Vth=1.4 plotted with
diamonds. When the threshold is reduced, we observe that the optimal noise y* = 0.4 provides a
better cross-covariance C},r, while increasing the threshold to Vth = 1.4 involves a weaker cross-
covariance. The curves presented for the three threshold values show that the more the image is
far from the threshold, the less the perception of the image is of good quality. Moreover, in the
same time, a greater noise level is required to optimize the system.

This fact can be visually confirmed if we compare the images perceived through the detector
for each optimal noise intensity y* corresponding to each of the three considered thresholds,
namely y* =0.4 for Vth=1.05, y* =0.5 for Vth=1.2 and y* =0.65 for Vth =1.4. These images
are reported in figure 5b-d. It is clear that the best perception is achieved for the weakest threshold
and that the quality of the perceived image decreases as the initial image is far from the threshold
detector.

Note that in the whole article and in all that follows, we restrict our study to the intermediate
value of the threshold Vth = 1.2.

We have also analysed the perception of the other initial images of figure 1 whose size N7
ranges from N? = 64? pixels to N? = 512? pixels. Our results are summarized in figure 6. For all
the considered initial images, a SR type curve is observed for the evolution of the cross-covariance
