This is a 240 detection, by this measure, and the probability of a false
alarm is something like 10-°°, even allowing for the fact that millions of templates would have
been tested against the data in the search. But the abstract quotes our confidence at something
like 50. This much more conservative figure comes from the fact that the detector noise is not
always Gaussian, but is characterized by random ‘glitches’, which are bursts of interference that
originate mainly within the detector. The detectors are extremely difficult to control at this sensitivity level; they have a duty cycle
only around 60-70%, and even when in operation mode their Gaussian data are frequently
interrupted by these glitches. Since the LIGO detection criterion is that an event should be
coincident between the two detectors, the analysis constructs the probability that two randomly
occurring glitches could also be coincident, and could look enough like a binary inspiral to
masquerade as a signal.
