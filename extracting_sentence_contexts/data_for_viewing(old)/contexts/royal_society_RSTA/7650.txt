Assuming that the amplitude as recorded by a Jaggar shock recorder is inversely
proportional to the distance of the station from the focus, the position of the focus
of any shock for which the amplitude distribution is known can be roughly estimated.

In several instances it is necessary to appeal to other considerations in estimating
the position of the focus. Thus shock No. 134 gave rise to the following amplitudes
relative to Gages: Olveston 0-17, St John’s 0-10, Bethel 1-0. It is not possible to find
a point which gives an amplitude distribution in accordance with the observations
on the assumption that the amplitude varies only with the distance from the focus.
We suggest that in this case the focus was relatively high up in the Soufriére Hills,
roughly equidistant between Gages and Bethel, and that the small amplitude at
Olveston and St John’s may be due either to the fact that owing to the details of the
local topography the direct waves from the focus could not reach these stations or
to the extremely broken nature of the intervening country.

Further information on the effect of the intervening topography on the amplitude
of the shocks as recorded at a given station is provided by the results obtained with
the distant shock of 19 June, No. D 8, the Wiechert record for which is shown in fig. 14.
It is estimated that this shock originated at a distance of about
45 km. from the instrument, and we should therefore expect
that there would not be large variations in the amplitude as re-
corded at the various Jaggar stations on the assumption that
