Section 3 gives a mathematical description of the heating process. In ยง4, experimental verification
of the heating process model is described. Section 5 concludes this article with some comments
and ideas for further work.

2. Fractional calculus

A fractional order differential calculus is a generalization of the integer order integral and
derivative to real or even complex order. This idea first emerged at the end of the seventeenth
century and has been developed in the area of mathematics throughout the eighteenth and
nineteenth centuries in the works of, for example, Liouville, Riemann, Cauchy, Abel, Griinwald
and many others. More recently, by the end of the twentieth century, it turned out that some
physical phenomena are modelled more accurately when fractional calculus is used. There exist
two (in fact three) main definitions of the fractional order integrals, derivatives and differences:
Riemann-Liouville, Caputo and Griinwald-Letnikov [3,14]. Some others are also present in the
literature but are less commonly used in these applications. To be precise, the Riemann-Liouville
and Caputo definitions concern both fractional derivatives and integrals.

To define the fractional order differ-integral, the definition of the I(x) function is needed. The
I(x) function is given in the following way [3]:

I(x) =| et FT dt, (2.1)

where Si(x) > 0.
