Observation showed that snch a difference of curvature existed. In one
experiment the sagittz of the spherical segments differed by 1:15 mm., which
diminished after 45‚Äù to 0'1 mm. When the system had apparently reached a
rmanent state the plate was reversed, the upper and lower bubbles exchanged
laces, and the fact that the measurements were to within the error of experiment
& same as before was taken as evidence that the phenomenon observed was not due
any inequality produced directly by the weight of the films. S The investigations of these observers have not left the question of the relation
Setween the surface tension and the thickness of a liquid film in a satisfactory state.
'D We have already pointed out* that the experiment of PLaTeau, who observed a
Ebble formed of liquide glycerique which lasted for three days, and was enclosed in a
:Zex5el containing sticks of caustic potash to dry the air, offers no guarantee that the
Smpoxsition of the liquid remained unaltered. As we have found that under circum-
Kances mueh less favourable to changet a soap film lost in thirty-eight minutes 23 out
Bf the 57:7 volumes of water contained in every 100 volumes of solution, it is practically
gertain that the constitution of PLaTEaU's bubble could not have been constant.
