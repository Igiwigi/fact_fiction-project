Although the molecules under study
will undoubtedly suffer catastrophic radiation damage, the shortness of the
pulse enables a signal (albeit weak) to be measured from the particle before
its disintegration [4]. In common with other theories developed for extracting
structural information from such molecules, we will first assume [9] that a
single molecule is hit by the X-ray beam at a time, with random orientations
each time. The fact that the particles are hit by the incident X-ray pulses in
random orientations enables the full three-dimensional structure of the scatter-
ing object to be found from the ensemble of diffraction patterns without
deliberate rotations of the object with a goniometer, as is usually done in
protein crystallography. However, despite the huge increase in the brightness
of an XFEL beam over all previous X-ray sources (a factor of about 10’), the
reduction in size from even a 0.1mm diameter crystal commonly used in
X-ray crystallography, to a single molecule (typically of diameter 10~* m) is
