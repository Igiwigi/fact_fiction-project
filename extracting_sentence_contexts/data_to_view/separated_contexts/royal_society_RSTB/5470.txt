The methods used for the separation and analysis of each sub-class will now be
described in detail. (3) Lotal carbon as compounds in solution.—The carbon content of duplicate portions
of 10 c.c. of the filtrate from the mycelium (p. 19) is estimated in the usual way by
wet combustion. Here it may be pointed out that a very useful check on the experimental details

up to this point is afforded by the fact that the sum of the carbon. present in each of
the four classes—

(a) Carbon in sulphuric bubbler (1a),

(b) Carbon in carbon dioxide (1b),

(c) Carbon in mycelium (2),

(d) Carbon in compounds in solution (3),

should equal the total carbon present in the culture medium, at the commencement
of the metabolism experiment, a figure which is determined for each batch of medium
made up. Any appreciable discrepancy points either to a leak of carbon dioxide
through faulty joints in the apparatus or to errors in the quantitative estimations.
