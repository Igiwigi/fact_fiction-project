analysis previously employed by GREENHILL (‘ Proc. Camb. Phil. Soc.,’ vol. 4, p. 4)
which does not involve Lamé functions. To facilitate the reading of the paper, the
results are first deduced by this method, and the Lamé analysis by which they were
originally obtained is reserved for an appendix.

The oscillations under consideration are found to be of two types. One of these
corresponds to an oscillation previously discussed by Horxrs in his ‘‘ Researches in
Physical Geology” (‘ Phil. Trans.,’ 1839). ‘This exists only in consequence of the
contained fluid, and in it the oscillations of the shell are similar in character to the
“forced” nutations of the earth produced by the action of the sun and moon. In
the other type the motion of the shell is closely analogous to the motion of a rigid
body when slightly disturbed from a motion of pure rotation about a principal axis,
and, in fact, identifies itself with such an oscillation in the event of the inertia of the
fluid becoming negligible.

On applying the problem to the case of the earth, the latter mode is that on which
the variations of latitude depend. The period, however, is found to be shorter than
it would be if the fluid were solidified, and thus, in this particular case, M. Forte's
results are contradicted. It appears to me to be highly probable that any such
freedom in the interior of the earth as that supposed by M. Fonte, provided the
surface does not undergo deformation, would have the effect of reducing, instead of
extending, the period, and the true explanation of the phenomenon is probably that
given by Nuewcoms (‘ Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society,’ March,
1892), who shows that the elasticity of the earth, as a whole, would have the effect
of prolonging the period.
