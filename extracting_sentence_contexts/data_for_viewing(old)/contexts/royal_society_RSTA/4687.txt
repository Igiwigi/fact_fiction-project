x zeae Cr", te [0,T), (2.2)

where € and 7 are to be chosen sufficiently small later and 4 stands for the first Dirichlet
eigenvalue associated with the domain 2.

(b) Norm S and total energy E are equivalent

Recall the notation ‘~’ introduced in (1.9).
Proposition 2.1. There exists a sufficiently small e' such that if S(t) < €’ on a time interval [0,T] then
S(t)* E(t), Wte[0,T].

Proof. The proof of this fact is one of the pillars of our strategy. It has been presented in detail
in §§2.1-2.5 and 4.2 of [11] and, therefore, we omit it here. We note that the direction S(f) < E(#) is
obviously harder to prove, as the energy function E(t) a priori controls only tangential derivatives
of the temperature q. In [11], we use a version of the elliptic regularity statement for equations
with Sobolev-class coefficients to obtain control of normal derivatives [41]. a


3. Lower bound on x (t) and improvement of the second bootstrap assumption

The heat equation (1.52) for q can be written in non-divergence form as
