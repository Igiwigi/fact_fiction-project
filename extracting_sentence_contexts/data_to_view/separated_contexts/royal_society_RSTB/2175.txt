Morphia{ in certain doses may exaggerate both cortical and reflex excitability in
dogs, although. the animals are, on the sensory side, brought by this drug into the
condition of decerebrate animals. The convulsants cicutin, strychnine, cocaine,ยง
picrotoxin, cinchonidin,|| acid sodium phosphate, and absinthe in small doses produce
convulsion, and in larger doses paralysis. The fact that aneesthetics stop the action
of convulsants shows that convulsions arise from the first stage and anesthesia or
paralysis from the second stage of disordered cerebral metabolism. This is borne out
by the fact that after a convulsant has been administered a far less quantity of the

aneesthetic agent is required to produce anvesthesia. There is no need to multiply
further examples of the fact that hyper-excitability is, as a rule, the first result of a
downward alteration of the metabolism of the nerve centres.
