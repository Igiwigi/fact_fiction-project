find the series of first integrals (in the next section I illustrate, on the cubic, the
general method of finding this series), we may form from among them the functions
of differential invariants, of semi-invariants, and of matrices which are constant along
the curve. These functions may be properly called (each in its proper sphere, as
homographic or Cartesian) differential expressions for the invariants of the curve.

It is perhaps worthy of remark that in showing the mode of integrating the

procedure.

21. The differential equation of the general cubic.

It has been previously shown that the order of this differential equation will be 9,
the degree 10, and the weight 35. It is also a function of u;, U,, Us, and U,, since
it is easily seen that ~, cannot explicitly enter the equation.

Written as a determinant, the equation is
