The pairs of investi-
gators, just mentioned, are also each responsible for a recent value of the heat of
formation of nitrous oxide. The heat of formation of nitric oxide is less well founded
the value taken being more or less a mean of values which differ considerably. In fact
the work of Briner, Boner and Rothen (1926) indicates a higher value for the heat of
formation of this gas and a much greater degree of dissociation than the values given
above. The heat of formation of hydrogen from atomic hydrogen is based on spectroscopic
and calorimetric determinations, whereas the heat resulting from the formation of
water vapour from OH and hydrogen is derived from explosion experiments by Lewis
and von Elbe (1935 4). The heats of formation of oxygen and nitrogen have a spectro-
scopic basis,

With regard to the compressibility characteristics of the various gas mixtures both
before and after explosion, it was considered reasonably safe to assume that under the
high temperatures reached in the explosion the perfect gas state was attained.
