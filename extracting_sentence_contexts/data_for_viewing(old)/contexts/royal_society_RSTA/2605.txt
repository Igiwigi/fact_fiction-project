on the MVP volume fraction, but this has a negligible effect on the results. As outgassing is
generally able to keep pace with exsolution, the MVP volume fraction remains close to the critical
MVP volume fraction up to the point of capillary trapping. This set of closure relationships
allow us to estimate the mass flow rate out of the chamber that results from outgassing.
This enters into the model description as sink terms in the conservation of mass, water and
enthalpy [24].

Our results show that the MVP volume fraction needed to form channels is lower taking into

account our improved initial bubble distributions (figure 4a). Owing to the fact that the formation is
of large bubbles is favoured in the best-connected areas of the porous medium, more of the MVP 1S

will be able to participate in the formation of channels. Larger pore spaces contain initially a
higher integrated mass of volatiles accessible for bubble growth than small pores. Larger and
more mobile bubbles are therefore predominantly formed in large and better-connected pore
space leading to a greater efficiency at forming MVP percolating pathways (see figures 2 and 3)

than expected from a random initial distribution of bubbles. Hence, well-connected pores collect : 83
more MVP mass, and stabilize channels at lower MVP volume fraction than found in Parmigiani (S
et al. [24]. However, the general behaviour remains similar; the most efficient outgassing regime :ยง
in terms of rate is still at intermediate crystallinity, in which channels can efficiently form due to : =
