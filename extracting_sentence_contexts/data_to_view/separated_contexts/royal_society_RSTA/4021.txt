The situation changes with magnetocaloric materials of first order, which show a thermal

hysteresis. This means that the back and forth transformation does not take place at the same : =
temperature. In fact, the heating and the cooling branch of the magnetization curve are separated : S
by the thermal hysteresis, which is illustrated for a conventional first-order transition in figure 2a. : 2
The corresponding S(T) diagram is shown in figure 2b. Such a behaviour is, for instance, : &
observed in certain Fe2P-type materials or in Laâ€”Fe-Si [32]. Owing to the existence of the thermal 22
hysteresis, the entropy curves under heating and cooling also do not coincide.
