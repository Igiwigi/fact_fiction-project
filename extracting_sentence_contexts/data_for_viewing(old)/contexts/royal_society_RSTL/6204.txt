But I s0on found that caoutchoue, when carefully distilled in iron vessels, yielded no
oletiant whatever. This is, moreover, in perfect accordance with experiments made by
me ome years ago *, in which I showed that caoutchoue, like many other oils, deco-
lorized the same quantity of bromine as oil of turpentine, A repetition of this experi-
ment, made with great precaution to ensure success, will be found further on.

The distillation was conducted with care in an iron alembic, the lowest temperature
being used consistent with the distillation of oils. In fact I even stopped the distilla-
tion before the whole of the last oil, h&y6ene, came over, in order to ensure the decom-
position taking place in the simplest manner. The crude distillate was very fctid,
and contained traces of yolatile bases derived from the decomposition of a minute trace
of vegetable cascine in the caoutchoue. The bases were removed by agitation of the oil
with dilute sulphuric acid ; the latter was then got rid of by washing with water, which,
in its turn, was subsequently removed by digestion with sticks of potash. The fluid thus
Prepared was easily separated by fractional distillation into two portions, one boiling
between 37% and 44* C., and the other between 170® and 180% The fractional Separa-
tion of the hydrocarbons in the crude distillate affords a very instructive example of the
extraordinary extent to which boiling-points are lowered by successive rectifications.
In the first rectification the product was yery small, below 116? C. The greater part
