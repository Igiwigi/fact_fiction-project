that is, with respect to any three conics, each of them the first or conic polar of A
point (A, p, ») with respect to the cubic. Considering then these three conics, take as
the equation of the line En+ny+&=0, and let (X, Y, Z) be the coordinates of a point
of intersection with the first conic, we have ;
EX+7Y +Z&=0,
X*+2IYZ=0; i
and combining with these a linear equation
«X+BY+yZ=0,
in which («, Þ, y) are arbitrary quantities, we have
X:Y:Z=91n—Pt:atl—yE:BE—an ;
(-m—PtY+21(at—y5)(BE—an)=0,
an equation in (, 3, y) which is in fact the equation in line coordinates of the two points

of intersection with the first conic. Developing and forming the analogous equations,
we find

and hence

which are respectively the equations in line coordinates of the three pairs of intersections.

Now combining these equations with the equation y=0, we have the equations of
