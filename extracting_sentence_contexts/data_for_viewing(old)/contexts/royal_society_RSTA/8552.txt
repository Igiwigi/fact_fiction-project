Now s is the distance along the curved path, reckoned zero at the vertex, and increasing
with time; and s is reckoned relative to the air, so we have

in which in contrast to (1), (2) and (3) there is no need for a special statement about sign.
The equations are much simplified by the fact that the upward speed is usually much
greater than the horizontal relative speed. For example, in a uniform wind of 10 m/s.
the steel ball, the size of a pea, is shot up with a muzzle speed of 150 m/s, at a tilt of
0-15 radian and reaches the earth again with a speed of 37 m/s.

So as the ball emerges from the muzzle

Vr try +r = rn (14002).
Again as the ball approaches the earth it is drifting somewhat with the wind and
Jretre tre = ry(1+ less than 0°04).
If we neglect the small excess of these coefficients above unity and put simply
