The statistics, however, are unique, and a complete investigation is therefore
required. This investigation has been carried out, as already stated, in two stages :
(1) for the epoch 1703-1754, and (2) for the epoch 1755-1828. The break at 1828
is due to the fact that the figures for one year, including a small part of 1829, and
nearly the whole of 1830, are unfortunately wanting. The epoch 1831-18387 is
obviously not in itself long enough to repay study. The results for the second epoch are considered first ; when the graph for this
epoch is examined and compared with that for the epoch 18388-1913 (Diagram IV),
surprising differences are found to exist.
