matches is higher in areas that were more male-biased that imposed heavily male-biased sex ratios in some parts

Table 3 presents the results of the IV estimation strategy dis-
cussed in §2. The estimation sample is much smaller than in
the preceding subsection because convicts were only present
in 32 of the 91 historical counties. The results for overall life
satisfaction are no longer statistically significant but the
results for marital satisfaction remain robust to this esti-
mation strategy, except for the result for the marital
satisfaction gap at the household level.

The fact that only marital satisfaction results are robust actu-
ally gives credence to the idea that the mechanism coupling
male-biased historic sex ratios and modern-day satisfaction
operates through the quality of mating and relationships,
rather than more generally.


Table 3. Marital satisfaction is higher in formerly male-biased areas: IV regression results. Notes: See table 2 for the list of controls. Standard errors are in
brackets. ‘Included’ means that all the variables in the categories described in the caption to table 2 were included as controls in the estimation. ‘Individual
controls’ also include gender. The historical county population has been excluded from the set of ‘Historical controls’ because of a multicollinearity issue with
the total number of convicts in a county (‘Number of convicts’). Standard errors in parentheses have been corrected for heteroskedasticity and for clustering at
the historical county level. Number of clusters (historical counties): 27. Standard errors in square brackets are bias-corrected cluster-robust to adjust for the small
number of clusters (see [31]). The reported p-values at the bottom of table 5 have been corrected by the Wild cluster bootstrap method by Cameron ef al. [32]
