These have different
roles in cellular protection, by conserving the structures of macromolecules and membranes, by
stabilizing membrane structures and proteins, by avoiding mechanical damage from vacuole
shrinkage in dehydrating cells and by minimizing oxidative stress from the enhanced production
of reactive oxygen. Resurrection plants can survive for months or years without water, and then
regrow at full vigour when watered, but they do not survive for years. From the fact that high temperatures and drought occurred through the time of the PTME,
and knowledge about desiccation tolerance in modern organisms, it should be possible to explore
how far drought contributed to the PTME killings. Studies of the physiology of modern microbes,
plants and animals have shown that some clades are extremely desiccation-tolerant, and evidence
could be sought whether the extinctions were selective. This would apply especially to some
invertebrate and plant groups, if the stress lasted no more than 1-10 years, and where seeds
or resting cysts could preserve the species long enough.
