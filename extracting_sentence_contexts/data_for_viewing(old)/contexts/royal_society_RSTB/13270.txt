mosquito lines (figure 2b). While at day-5 PE, there was no
difference in midgut wAIbB levels between the two lines, at
day-10 PE the Wolbachia density was significantly higher in
the wAIbB.MC line compared to wAIbB.L. Wolbachia density
in salivary glands was similar between mosquito lines at all
ages (figure 2c).

wAlbB-carrying Ae. aegypti collected from a field site in Kuala
Lumpur 20 months following the cessation of releases [1] did
not show significant reductions in overall Wolbachia density
or a diminished somatic density and tissue distribution com-
pared to a laboratory colony [4], suggesting an absence of
strong selection in the field. In fact, densities were found to
be higher in the field line in whole bodies and midgut tissues
for some time points. Further work will be needed to deter-
mine whether this difference is maintained with broader
sampling and whether it is driven by host and/or symbiont
genetic factors, or other variables such as the microbiota.
Importantly, wAIbB in the field line continues to effectively
inhibit the capacity for dengue virus to disseminate to and
infect the salivary glands of females, thereby reducing trans-
mission potential, with levels of viral inhibition similar to
