In the rocks of Upernivik Island
occur side by side Wealden Ferns and Gymnosperms and Platanus leaves hardly distin-
guishable from living species. The point I wish to make is that in the Cretaceous floras
of Greenland, Dicotyledons, which are surprisingly modern in the form of the leaves,
occur in association with Ferns and Gymnosperms, which in other parts of the world are
characteristic of floras distinguished by an absence of any recognisable examples of
modern Angiosperms. This fact lends support to the view that it was within the Arctic
circle that the evolution of deciduous Angiosperms progressed with greater rapidity
and energy than in more southern latitudes. A factor concerned in this development
may have been the alternation of continuous sunshine and a long period of rest. The Greenland flora agrees most closely with Lower Cretaceous floras of Europe and
North America, and with floras of the Old and New Worlds which are usually regarded as
Cenomanian in age.
