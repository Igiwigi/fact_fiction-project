It should be stated that, taking the mean of 7 determinations by the soda-lime
method, the rich garden soil used contained 0°261 per cent. of nitrogen. This
Bousstncautr calculated would correspond to 11,310 kilog. nitrogen per hectare
(= 10,098 Ibs. per acre), one-third of a metre deep. He also determined the
amounts of ammonia, nitric acid, and carbon, in the soil; and he concluded that
the nitrogen, beyond the small amount existing as ammonia or nitric acid, was in
combination as organic matter. In fact it existed in organic detritus, and especially
in a black substance which he observed by the microscope.

Referring to the figures, it is seen that in the experiment in 1858 there was a gain
of 00714 gram nitrogen, upon a total of 0°3597 supplied in soil and seed. Further,
calculation shows that, of the total gain 0°0672 gram was in the soil, and only
0:0042 gram in the plant, notwithstanding that the original soil contained 0°3393 gram
nitrogen. BoussiNGAUL?T remarks that the fertilising matters in the soil had thus
scarcely taken any part in the growth; the conclusion being that it was only the
nitrogen that existed as, or was transformed into, ammonia or nitric acid, that was
available. He further remarks, that it was impossible, that anything like the amount
of excess of nitrogen in the soil could be due to the débris of the vegetable matter of
the lupin, roots, &e. He adds:—ZIt is the soil and not the plant which has fixed
