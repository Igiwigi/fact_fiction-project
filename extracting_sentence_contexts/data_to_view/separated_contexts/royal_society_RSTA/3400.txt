If physicists listened to Bohr (with whom we agree on many points) and abandoned

constructing mental images, the progress of science would be compromised. : =
This is why recent experiments of Couder and co-workers [81], with bouncing droplets : a
(http: / /dualwalkers.com), may help perhaps to develop one day a more intuitive understanding 3
of wave-particle duality and of quantum phenomena. : XS
There is still no general agreement how to interpret QM and QFT and how to reconcile them : _
with general relativity. In our opinion, a rigorous epistemological and ontological analysis of QFT : Ss
is still lacking. Dh
Incorrect interpretation of QT and/or incorrect mental images of quantum particles and 13
measurements lead to paradoxes and to speculations which are pure science fiction. 1S

Leslie Ballentine said in his book: ‘Once acquired, the habit of considering an individual
particle to have its own wave function is hard to beak. Even though it has been demonstrated
strictly incorrect’ [33]. Statistical contextual interpretation, inspired by Bohr and Einstein, seems
to be the most cautious [29,33,35-37,61].
