No. 11. (Situated on the lower extremity of the ascending parietal gyrus covering
the space between the hinder end of the fissure of Rotanpo and the lower end of
the intraparietal sulcus,) “ Retraction of the Angle of the Mouth.” “The action is
that of the platysma myoides, and when this is strong the head is drawn slightly to
the side.”

H. Munx* confirmed the fact that the movements of the face and tongue were
represented in the Monkey in the area delineated by Hrrzic and by Ferrter, but
did not record minuter details of the localisation.

Sonirer and Horstry.t—These investigators found on sub-dividing the facial area,
as marked out by Ferri, that the broad facts described by him were correct, except
that the wpper part of the area was the seat of elevation of the angle of the mouth,
and that the Jower half was the region of retraction of the same. (It may be noted
that Ferrier, in the last chapter of his book, when he transfers the excitation
results from the Monkey’s brain to that of Man, places these areas of representation
in the reverse order, 7.¢., the same as ScHArER and Horstey, and, as will presently
be seen, the same as we have found it, namely, “Elevation” above “ Retraction.)
They further observed that just below the upper border of the so-called face region,
i.e., just opposite to the lower end of the intraparietal sulcus, the movements of

winking and of closure (synchronous) of both pairs of eyelids were therein repre-
sented; also that half-way down the vertical limit of the precentral sulcus and
just below it, the movement of drawing in and out of both cheeks was elicited
