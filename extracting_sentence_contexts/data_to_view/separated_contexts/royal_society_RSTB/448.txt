The minutiz about to be described form minor patterns of their own, quite distinct
from the larger patterns shown in fig. 9. They are chiefly connected with the com-
mencements of interpolated ridges, At or about a particular spot in the pattern two
ridges that had previously run in parallel and adjacent courses are replaced by three
ridges (fig. 11). This is the main fact to be noticed. The particular way in which

because its appearance is often false and misleading. The conversion may have been
affected either by a new ridge arising between two others which diverge so as to yield
place to the intruder, as in fig. 11a, or else by one of the two ridges bifurcating, as
in b and «.
