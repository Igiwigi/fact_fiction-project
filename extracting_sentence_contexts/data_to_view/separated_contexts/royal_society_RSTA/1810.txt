The large amount of tidal energy which these calculations show to be absorbed in
the Irish Sea naturally gives rise to speculations as to how large a proportion of the
energy of the tidal wave is absorbed, and how much of it is reflected back to the
Atlantic. It has generally been believed that tidal friction plays only a very small part in
tidal phenomena. Reasoning on the lines of the present work, however, the mere
fact that it is possible to find a section where the rise and fall of tide is appreciable
and where the phases of the tidal current and tidal height are the same, is a proof -
that an appreciable proportion of the energy of the tidal wave entering through the
South Channel is absorbed. We cannot measure the size of the tidal wave which
enters the Irish Sea directly, because at all points the effects of the entering aud of
the emerging wave will be felt simultaneously. It is necessary therefore to disentangle
those effects.
