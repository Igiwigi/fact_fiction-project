proof rather than the factual truth of ‘what really happened’
regarding disputed facts. Critics fail to appreciate that adver-
sarial procedure is designed to promote truth-seeking not to
frustrate it. Before sceptical readers fall about laughing, let
me stress that this is a claim about the system as a whole and

its institutional design, not about the motivations of pro-
fessional participants in particular cases. Indeed, the very
self-serving partisanship which adversarial lawyers are
expected to display in developing their litigation strategies is
the motor that drives adversarial truth-seeking. The parties
have both the presumptive knowledge and the strongest
motivation to present their own best cases to the fact-finder,
and to interrogate their adversarial opponent’s arguments
and supporting evidence through vigorous cross-examination.
Adversarialism is an incomparably efficient way of narrowing
down the issues and getting to the heart of factual disputes
[51,55]. Criminal procedure regulates not only the generation
and presentation of evidence, but also its testing and evalu-
ation. It is surely plausible to maintain, as a general
proposition, that evidence that has withstood concerted foren-
sic examination offers securer epistemic warrant for judicial
fact-finding and jury verdicts than evidence that has never
been tested in the forensic crucible.
