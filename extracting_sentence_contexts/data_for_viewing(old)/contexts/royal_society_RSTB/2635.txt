particularly suggestive. He writes : “It is remarkable that in longitudinal sections
there can barely be any tabule observed outside of the columella.” (‘Salt Range
Fossils, p. 898, “ Coelenterata in Productus-Limestone.”)

Not infrequently the tabulz seem to have been laid down so closely that they
formed an almost solid calcareous deposit. The Cyathaxonide, E.H.,is a familyimcluding
Paleozoic genera and one Triassic genus; it is of special interest in the study of
basal structures. The essential feature is a prominent columella; a second feature
which may be regarded as correlated, is the scanty development or absence of basal
structures. Lindstrdmia, the oldest of the genera (Ordov. to Carb.), has well-developed
septa reaching to the columella ; the septa are smooth on their surfaces and at their
edges; they have “ pinnate ” arrangement with regard to four principal septa, and a
slight fossula is present. The chief fact which at present calls our attention is
that “ stereoplasm ” fills the lower part of the visceral chamber, while in the upper
part dissepiments or tabulve are scantily developed (cf: Nictonson, ‘ Manual,’ loc. cit.,
p- 298). Fruce says the endothecal deposit is sometimes entirely stereoplasmic,
(‘ Trias. Korallen Paleont.,’ loc. ett., p. 81.) In certain recent Oculinids in Seriatopora,
and in a few Turbinolids (all of which I hold to be related to the ancient Zaphren-
tide), the basal structures are at times individual laminew, 7.¢., tabule or thin
dissepiments, and in the same coral may take the form of solid deposit, so-called
“ stereoplasm.” We need not then place much importance on the difference in the
basal structures of Lindstrdmia, and of the genus of the Cyathaxonide next to it in
age—Cyathamonia. The latter has similar septal and columellar features, but no tabule
or dissepiments.
