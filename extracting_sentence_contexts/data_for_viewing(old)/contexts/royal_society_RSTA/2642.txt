superhydrophobic surface which roll down. In the case of hydrophilic and superhydrophilic
surfaces, the droplets spread across the surface, leading to higher evaporation.

Another observed trend is that a beetle-inspired surface is better than a homogeneous
wettability surface. This is because of the heterogeneity; droplets can slide/roll at a faster rate,
allowing them to maintain a spherical droplet shape, leading to lesser evaporation.

Next, the effect of smaller particles was investigated. Smaller particles have lower pitch of
asperities on the surface as compared to the larger particles which affect the number of nucleation
sites. Smaller particles are believed to increase the water collection rate because of more nucleation
sites leading to a larger number of smaller droplets coalescing faster. Indeed, there was an increase
observed on the beetle-inspired surface, however, the superhydrophobic surface resulted in no
water collection at a 45° inclination. This is because of the fact that smaller particles nucleate
smaller droplets, as shown in the optical images, which could lead to losing droplets to the wind.
