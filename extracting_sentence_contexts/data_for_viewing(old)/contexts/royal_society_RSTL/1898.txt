497. As, therefore, the substances evolved in cases of electro-chemical de-
composition may be made to appear against air (465. 469.),—which, according
to common language, is not a conductor, nor is decomposed; or against water
(495.), which is a conductor, and can be decomposed,—as well as against
the metal poles, which are excellent conductors, but undecomposable, there
appears but little reason to consider the phenomena generally, as due to the
attraction or attractive powers of the latter, when used in the ordinary way,
Since similar attractions can hardly be imagined in the former instances.

498. It may be said that the surfaces of air or of water in these cases hecome
the poles, and exert attractive powers; but what proof is there of that, except
the fact that the matters evolved collect there, which is the point to be ex-
plained, and cannot be justly quoted as its own explanation ? Or it may be
said, that any section of the humid conductor, as that in the present case,
where the solution and the water meet, may be considered as representing the
pole. But such does not appear to me to be the view of those who haye
written on the snbject, certainly not of some of them, and is inconsistent with
the supposed laws which they have assumed, as governing the diminution of
power at increased distances from the poles.

499. GroTTavUss, for instance, describes the poles as centres of attractive and
repulsive forces (481), these forces yarying inversely as the squares of the di-
stances, and says, therefore, that a particle placed anywhere between the poles
will be acted upon by a constant force. But the compound force, resulting
