sulphur dioxide, in the hope that the sulphur trioxide formed, along with any
occluded sulphur dioxide, might be completely extracted im vacuo at a temperature
which would not impair the absorptive power of the platinum black for oxygen.

It was found, however, that although practically all the oxygen was removed
as SO, in this way, the platinum black itself was charged with 84°2 volumes of
sulphur dioxide. Of this occluded sulphur dioxide, which for the purpose we had in
view was quite as objectionable as oxygen, only about one-fifth, or 15 volumes, could
be removed in vacuo at the ordinary temperature ; whilst for its complete removal
ignition at a red heat, and consequently the conversion of the black into sponge, was
necessary,

From the fact that the platinum black originally contained about 79°5 volumes
of oxygen, and that 84:2 volumes of SO, were subsequently occluded, it may be
inferred that platinum black occludes approximately the same number of volumes
of both gases.

Carbon monowide.—As we already know from former experiments, carbon dioxide
may be readily removed from platinum black at temperatures which do not seriously
affect its absorptive power. Attempts were therefore made to convert the oxygen
contained in platinum black into carbon dioxide by the admission of carbon monoxide.
Experiments showed that the bulk of the oxygen could be easily removed in this
way, but on exhausting the tube it was found that carbon monoxide was itself
occluded by the platinum black, and could only be removed by heating to redness in
a vacuum.
