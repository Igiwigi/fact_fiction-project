Predicting the future is a difficult task at the best of times, but the sheer complexity and time
horizon associated with climate change amplifies these difficulties. Our knowledge about the
future of climate change comes from two main sources: (i) scientific understanding, including
physical laws and (ii) the empirical predictions of climate models. While the laws are matters of


fact, the movement from laws to predictions leads to an uncertain picture of the future as the models
attempt to reproduce extremely complex systems using different assumptions and calibrations. There is a distinction to be drawn between predictions or forecasts and projections in this context. The former ‘attempts to account for the correct phase of natural internal climate variations (such
as the El Nifto Southern Oscillation), whereas the latter does not’.
