have had to report to William Preece with whom he had an antagonist relationship [32]. Because of : Nw
the physical separation between the two brothers—AWH living in Newcastle with OH in London 7S
and later Devon—and possibly due to OH’s deafness, much of the relationship—working and :&
personal—between the two brothers is documented through written correspondence, some of ,
which has survived in the IET archives in London and which are referred to throughout this
paper.!! The two did continue to meet in person—meeting regularly in London for dinner [34
(figure 5).

Despite the physical distance between the two, until 1888 OH’s sole scientific collaborator
was his brother AWH, with his experimental notebooks showing the various experiments and
projects the brothers collaborated on between 1880 and 1887.2 AWH used his brother as a kind
of technical and scientific adviser and sounding board—in one letter promising in his next letter
to write about ‘what we are doing electrically in the post office and some facts about insulation
which will make you stare’.!> AWH’s experiments and technical developments at this time
included experiments with ABC telegraph exchange for mercantile communication in Newcastle,
in particular collieries and shipping offices in 1880 and in 1882 devised a metallic circuit system of
telephones known as the ‘North East (Northern)’ system, moving away from rented telegraphy
lines [1]. The latter made AWH a pioneer of underground wires for telephones and resulted in
very few open telephone wires in Newcastle from the early days of telephony. AWH’s interest in
the potential of telephony in the first decade of development continued and, between 1886 and
1887, the two brothers collaborated on an innovative ‘Bridge telephone’ system for long-distance
telephone lines in Newcastle—a strong example of their collaborative relationship as well as their
difficult relationship with William Preece.
