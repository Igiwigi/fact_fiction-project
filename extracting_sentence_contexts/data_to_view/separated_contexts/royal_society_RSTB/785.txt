Butven Newton, “ On the Discovery of a Secondary Reptile in Madagascar, Steneosaurus Baroni
(n. sp.) ; with a reference to some Post-Tertiary Vertebrate Remains from the same country, recently
acquired by the British Museum (Natural History).” (‘Geolog. Magazine,’ Decade III., vol. 10,
No. 347, May, 1893, p. 197.) Mr. B. Newron draws besides attention to the fact that a few Hippo-
potamus teeth from Madagascar were sent to this country as long as sixty years ago, and are preserved
in the Museum of the Geological Society, the label accompanying stating them to come from a locality
thirty miles from Antananarivo, which is the capital, situated in Central Madagascar. The brief
reference in the ‘Proc. of the Geol. Soc. of London,’ (vol. 1, No. 31, 1833, p. 479), runs as follows :—
“A letter was afterwards read from Mr. Tenrar to Sir ALexanper Jounston, V-P.R.A.S., accompanying
a specimen of recent conglomerate rock, from the Island of Madagascar, containing fragments of a tusk
and part of a molar tooth of a Hippopotamus, and communicated by Ropurick Inery Murcnisoy, Esq,,

F.G.8.”
