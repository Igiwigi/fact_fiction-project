of the models to realistically represent these features.
Such model evaluation is most commonly based on
the direct comparison between simulation results and
measurements of individual observables. Related studies
often imply that such a comparison can result in
absolute statements regarding model quality, which is
reflected, for example, in rankings of model simulations
based on their agreement with a specific observable,
in the misleading use of terms such as ‘verification’ or
‘validation’ [1], or in generic calls that models need to be
improved that fail to match a specific observable.
However, such assessments ignore the fact that
models are tools that are in practice used to answer
