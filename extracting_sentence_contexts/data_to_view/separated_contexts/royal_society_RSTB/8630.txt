We recorded three
sets of data corresponding to three different sample-detector
distances, and each set had unique detector artefacts. Unprocessed estimates of the correlation function (2.6) in
the data we obtained are dominated by such systematic arte-

Our goal was to record as many snapshots as possible, each (1 <m < 60).
