Taz experimental researches described in a former paper * led me indirectly to the con-
clusion that the electric spark, whether obtained directly from the prime conductor of
an ordinary electrifying machine, or from the discharge of a Leyden jar, emits rays of
very high refrangibility, surpassing in this respect any that reach us from the 8sun—and
that these rays pass freely through quartz, while glass absorbs them, as it does also the
most refrangible of the solar rays. I was induced in consequence to procure prisms and
a lens of quartz, which were applied in the first, instance to the examination of the solar
Spectrum, and which immediately revealed the existence of an invisible region extending
as far beyond that previously known as the latter extends beyond the visible spectrum,
and exhibiting a continuation of FRAUNHOFER'S lines Ff. A map of the new lines was
exhibited at an evening lecture delivered before the British Association at their Meeting
in Belfast in the autumn of the same year ; and I then stated that I conceived we had
obtained evidence that the limit of the solar spectrum in the more refrangible direction
had been reached, In fact, the very same arrangement which revealed, by means of
fluorescence, the existence of what were evidently rays of higher refrangibility coming
from the electric spark failed to show anything of the kind when applied to the solar
spectrum. At least, the only link in the chain of evidence which remained to be 8up-
plied by direct experiment related to the reflecting power, for rays of high refrangibility,
of the metallic speculum of the heliostat which was employed to reflect the sun's rays
into a convenient direction ; and this was shortly afterwards tested by direct experiment,
on rays from an electric discharge 8eparated by prismatic refraction. In making preparations for a lecture on the subject delivered at the Royal Institution
in February 1853, in which I had the benefit of the kind assistance of Mr.
