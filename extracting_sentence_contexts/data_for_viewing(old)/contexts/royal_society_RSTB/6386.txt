almost identical and the only difference is in the size of the egg. It seems impossible
to conceive any means by which such identity can be maintained when extracellular
parental nutrition is substituted for intracellular yolk.

On the other hand, if the difference in egg-size of these two genera is due, not to
quantitative reduction merely in egg-volume, but to a diminution in the water
content or cytoplasmic content of the egg, the unchanged course of development
can be explained.

The above suggestion implies that the amount of yolk per egg remains unchanged,
so that development can continue to the same stage before an external source of food
becomes necessary. The yolk content per unit volume is greatly increased, however,
and this explains the fact that the cleavage and gastrulation rate is not accelerated
by the reduction in egg-volume. The embryonic period as a whole remains
unchanged because the chordal cells receive their full load of yolk, so that in spite of
their smaller size they swell more slowly rather than less. The endodermal cells
receive their full yolk complement also and are therefore able to develop at least as
far as do those of Botryllus during the embryonic period. It is suggested, therefore,
that instead of there being placentation of the Botrylloid embryo, the reduction in
egg-size has left the total amount of yolk per egg unchanged. The appearance of
the eggs of Botryllus and Botrylloides is in harmony with the above conclusion.
