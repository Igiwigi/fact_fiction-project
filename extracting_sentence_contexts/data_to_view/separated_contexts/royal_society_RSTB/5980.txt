If this were so, then it follows that the vertebrate body originally
possessed vertebrae from segment 5 backwards, but no vertebre anterior to segment 5. In this connexion, attention may be called to three points, all of which provide evidence
for the view that segment 5 represents a transitional region between an anterior non-
vertebral part and a posterior vertebral part of the skull. First, there is the well-known fact that in Cyclostomes, the skull occupies 4 segments
only, and the vertebre are only incipient. Were they to condrify as proper vertebra,
the foremost one would be in segment 5. Next, there is the fact that in the develop-
ment of the skull in Selachians, the notochordal sheath is invaded by the cartilage
cells of the parachordal from its hinder edge to a point opposite the middle of the
auditory capsules (vAN WIsJHE, 1922; DE Breer, 1931, a).
