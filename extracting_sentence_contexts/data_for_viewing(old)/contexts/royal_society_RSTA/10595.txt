PROFESSOR C. J. JOLY ON QUATERNIONS AND PROJECTIVE GEOMETRY. 267

a quaternion array may be defined as a function which vanishes if, and only if, the
constituents of every row can be linearly connected by the same set of scalar multi-
pliers. It is multiplied by a scalar if every constituent in a column is multiplied by
that scalar; and the sign of the array is changed if contiguous columns are trans-
posed.

These laws are precisely the laws which govern the function (abcd), which is in
fact a one-row array, so that if in (257) we replace any one of the four quaternions
by any quaternion va + yb+ ze + wd, the quotient remains unchanged. The
quotient is therefore an invariant in the Hamiltonian sense ; it remains unchanged
when the four quaternions a, b, c, d are operated on by the function Y.

If we regard the lowest row as consisting of the results of operating by the
special linear function wnity on a, b, ¢ and d, and if we replace f, /...f, by X/AY,
XAY,...Xf,Y and unity in the last row by XY; toa factor, nynx, the quotient
becomes the corresponding quotient for the system of functions
