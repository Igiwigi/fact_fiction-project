Well, after these various remarks about the makings of a good researcher, my recommendation to
you is ‘give it a try!’

(b) A good memory may help

I have myself witnessed the simple fact that a good memory might help a lot! During a holiday
tour of the USA with my family (wife Margaret, and children Richard and Helen) in 1980, we
