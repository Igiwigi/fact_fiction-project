Hence it appears that the present theory in which the effects of viscosity are totally
disregarded will almost certainly give a far better representation of the lunar long-
period tides than the equilibrium theory, and most probably also of the long-period
solar tides,

§ 14. Free Steady Motions. In the last section we have called attention to the fact that free oscillations of
infinite period are possible, or that the system with which we are concerned is
capable of free steady motions. We proceed in the present section to examine the
nature of these steady motions. Referring back to §§ 2-4, we see that the general equations of motion of the ocean
when free from external disturbing influence, and at the same time supposed steady,
so that } = 0, can be expressed in the form
