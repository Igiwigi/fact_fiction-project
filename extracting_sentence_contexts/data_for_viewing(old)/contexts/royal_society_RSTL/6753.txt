ad been added at the commencement, presented the appearance of clean soil or pumice,
without organic matter. In the excepted cases the shell of the gram was still visible.
Tf we take into consideration the amount of growth in several of the cases on April 28,
It will be seen how great must have been the subsequent decomposition s0 entirely to
# rid of the organic matter.

It is worthy of remark, that, in a few instances, the sulphuric acid in the bottle D,
fig. 8, Plate I., became coloured slightly brown, indicating the passage into it, through
the oxalic acid, of 80me carbon-compound more complicated than carbonic acid. In the
course of other parts of our investigation, we have observed phenomena indicative of a
8milar result ; but as we have not followed up the subject, we leave it with only this

_ Femark as to the fact of what we have observed.
