Assamese or Burmese forms. These facts are consistent with the theory that the
Tudo-Malay part of the Himalayan fauna, or the greater portion of it, has migrated
into the mountains from the eastward at a comparatively recent period. It is an
important fact that this migration appears to have been from Assam and not from
the Peninsula of India.*

Thus there are several points left which require explanation. There is the much
greater richness of the Oriental constituent in the Cisgangetice fauna to the south-
ward in Malabar and Ceylon, although this is far away from the main Oriental area,
and the occurrence also in the southern part of the peninsula of various mammalian,
reptilian, and batrachian genera, such as Loris, Tragulus, Draco, [iolepis, and

* There is no result of the present enquiry into the distribution of Indian vertebrates which is so
surprising as the close connection shown between the Himalayas and Burma, and the evidence in favour
of the principal elements in the Himalayan fauna having been derived, probably at no distant period
geologically, from the Assam range. As this view of the relations exhibited by the Himalayan fauna is
