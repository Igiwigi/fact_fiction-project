Similar effects were seen on shaking the leaves of Thalia dealbata.

There can be no doubt that these results are due to the deturgescence of the
epidermic cells relieving the pressure and allowing the guard cells to open.* The
fact that the stomata of terrestrial leaves do not open when the leaf is shaken is no
doubt due to the violence of the treatment causing the deturgescence of the guard
cells, and so quickly that the preliminary rise is absent. It is possible, however, that
BaraNeETzky’s and Kont’s results may be due to temporary opening of the stomata.

It will be noticed that a slight fall in the hygroscope readings follows the shaking
in Sagittaria ; whether this corresponds to the physical effect produced with pieces
of bread I cannot say. The question seems hardly worth the labour which an answer
