Epwasvs, in relation to the
present subject, which it is important to point out. M. Epwarps first ascertained
the interesting fact, that the very young of those species of animals which are
born blind, lose their temperature if removed from the contact of their parent ;
and justly concludes that they have not sufficient power of evolving heat, to
maintain their natural temperature when 80 exposed. M. Epwarps then sub-
