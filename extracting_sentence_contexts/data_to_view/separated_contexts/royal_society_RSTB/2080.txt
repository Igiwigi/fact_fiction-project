We have next to enquire what evidence there is as to the interaction of the two
parts of the machine at night. ScHArer* has sought to show that the guard cells
are autonomous by proving that stomata, freed by incision from surrounding pressure,
do not open if they have been previously closed by darkness. I think this argument
is just, although the facts do not seem to me precisely as ScHArer finds. Thus T
have found slight opening in Trop@olumt when the darkened leaf is severed from
the plant ; the amount of opening is not perceptible with the horn hygroscope, but
clearly affects the Yucca instrument. This is of no particular importance, since it is
certainly true that the stomata open less easily in the dark, What is of importance
is that in the early morning the stomata open when the leaf is cut, whereas they do
not do so in the evening.
