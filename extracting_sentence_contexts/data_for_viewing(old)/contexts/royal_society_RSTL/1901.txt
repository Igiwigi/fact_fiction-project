all theories that place the decomposing effect in the attractive power of the
poles.

500. Sir Humenry Davy, who also speaks of the diminution of power with
increase of distance from the poles * (483.), supposes, that when both poles are
acting on substances to decompose them, still the power of decomposition

diminishes to the middle distance. In this statement of fact he is opposed to
GroTravss, and quotes an experiment in which suIphate of potassa, placed at
different distances from the poles in a humid conductor of constant length,
decomposed when near the pole, but not when at a distance. Such a conse-
quence would necessarily result theoretically from considering the poles as
centres of attraction and repulsion ; but I have not found the statement borne
out by other experiments (505.) ; and in the one quoted by him the effect was
doubtless due to some of the many interfering causes of variation which attend
such investigations.

501. A glass vessel had a platina plate fixed perpendicularly across it, 80 as
to divide it into two cells : a head of mica was fixed over it, s0 as to collect the
gas it might eyolye during experiments ; then each cell, and the space beneath
