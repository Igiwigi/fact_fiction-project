This and the previous sections, however, show
that it is laterally continuous over a very wide area, and that its maximum extension is
a recognizable and important phase in the fenland development. Before Guyhirne is reached the uppermost bed of the lower peat has feathered out. The great depth of the hard beds in this district made borings with a hand drill
exceedingly difficult, and the fact that the fen floor rises to form the March Island
instead of maintaining its original seaward gradient, practically limited our attention
to the upper peat bed. Between Bankhouse Farm G and Guyhirne, the upper peat, as
originally described by Skertchly, passes beneath a natural deposit of silt which
varies locally from blue to pinkish in colour.* Superficially the silt terminates on the
landward side in irregular processes, and as an infilling of former river channels, whilst
on the seaward side it is continuous with the pink silts of the Old Ouse estuary about
Upwell and Wisbech. At Pear Tree Hill a peat bed of equivalent level to the upper
peat at Guyhirne was found below some 5 ft. of such silt, from which Romano-British
objects are said to have been recovered, and above a bed of soft fen clay.
