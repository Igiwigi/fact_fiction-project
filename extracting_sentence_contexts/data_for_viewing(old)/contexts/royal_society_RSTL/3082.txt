LAWS_OF THE TIDES FROM SHORT SERIES OF OBSERVATIONS. 233

their existence. Till the subject of the tides is thus treated in a manner worthy of
its scientific importance, and of the promise which it now holds forth, it must be
considered as offering a blot in that system- of the national cultivation of astronomy,
of which our public obseryatories are, in other departments of science, such effective
and magnificent examples.

8. The reference of the phenomena of the tides to mechanical principles by rigor-
ons reasoning has not yet been executed; and we can see enough of the difficulties
of the snbject to believe that it will probably be some time before this problem can
be fully solved. In the meanwhile, we have an intermediate type of comparison for
the facts, in the equilibrium theory of BzrxouLLi: for that theory, by modifying the
epochs and other elements, may be made to represent in an approximate manner the
laws of the phenomena. Nor does it appear to be too much to expect, that it may
hereafter be rigorously shown from mechanical principles, that the form of an irre-
gular moving fluid mass, constantly dragged along by certain forces, shall at every
instant resemble the form of equilibrium which the forces would produce at some
anterior epoch, the anterior epoch being somewhat different for the different features
of the fluid form. If snch a hydrodynamical proposition could be established, almost
all the facts hitherto discovered respecting the tides would be fully explained.

9. The materials of the following researches are the tide observations made at
Plymouth in the years 1834, 1835, 1836, and 1837, under the direction of the Dock
Master and Assistant Dock Master ; and the observations made at Bristol in 1834,
