We have here a $till further confirmation of the greater amount of the horizontal
force in the summer than in the winter months; the difference between the two
Seasons is in this experiment greater than that shown by the Bifilar observations for
1842, or than that derived from the more extended absolute series from January 1845
to April 1849. Itis quite conceivable however that, independently of errors of mea-
Surement, the actual numerical difference between the summer and winter months
may be liable to vary in different years.

By three independent methods of experiment, therefore, the general fact of an
annual variation of the horizontal force at Toronto has been shown, the force being
greater in the summer than in the winter months; but the question of whether this
variation, as well as that of the inclination, is progressive from one extreme in mid-
winter to the opposite extreme in midsummer, and vice versd, the regularity of the
progression being only interrupted by the complication of irregular disturbances,—or
whether, as in the case of the diurnal variation, the change from one half-yearly phase
to the other takes place (subject to the same complication) about, the time of the
equinoxes,—will require a longer period for its determination than that which we
have at present before us. Upon the latter supposition, we find, from the absolute
series at Toronto, that the inclination is on the average 088 above its mean yalue,
and the horizontal force 0015 below its mean value during the five months when
the sun is in the southern signs,—and the inclination 0':90 below, and the hori-
