addition of nitric acid ; slow evaporation yields a rich crop of the cubes and octahedra
of the chloride of sodium. The morphotic elements vary in a remarkable manner
in different species ; that is, for the same species, the individuals being different, the
corpuscles of the chylaqueous fluid are constant, and nearly the same in microscopic
characters for every season of the year. In different species therefore these solid
elements of this fluid, like the corpuscles in the blood of vertebrated animals, become
signs of specific distinction, but the specific variations are much less marked than the
generic. In the case of the Annelids, it is susceptible of demonstration that the float-
ing cells of the chylaqueous fluid vary in apparent structural characters with the age
of the individual. For some time after the emergence of the young from the ovum and
before the development of the branchial, pedal, and tentacular appendages, the chyl-
aqueous fluid is a limpid, transparent, non-corpusculated liquid. It bears not a trace
of floating corpuscles. This fact is full of interest. As the worm progresses in growth,
s0 the corpuscles slowly appear in the chylaqueous fluid. The blood and the blood-
system are produced before the floating cells are generated in the chylaqueous fluid.
The conclusion is evident. In the young Annelid the agency of the floating corpuscles
of the chylaqueous fluid is not required either for the elaboration of the fibrine or the
production of the pigment of the blood-proper. But it is important to guard against
