was to some extent awe-inspiring, we could not, for a long time, detect any trace of
rupture. The escape of air-bubbles from the surface first informed us of the position
and direction of the incipient crevasse, for such it was. It was 80 narrow that the
thinnest blade of my penknife would not enter it.

On another occasion, our guide, while engaged in setting out one of our lines, observed
Sthe ice to break beneath his feet, and a rent to propagate itself suddenly, with loud
Seracking, to a distance of 50 or 60 yards across the glacier. These fissures are produced
by tension, and the velocity with which they widen is a measure of the amount of relief
Sdemanded by the glacier. The crevasse last alluded to required several days to attain
=Y width of 3 inches, and the opening of the one on the Glacier du Geant was far
Slower than this. This is their general character. They form suddenty and open 8lowly.
Sand both facts are demonstrative of the non-viscosity of the ice. For were the substance
.Zeapable of stretching, even at the 8mall rate at which they widen, there would be no neces-
:2aity for their formation *.

'S There is another point of view from which the question of viscosity may be examined ;
Sbut as the observations which bear upon it possess a general value, I will devote a
Special section to them ; choosing afterwards those which more particularly apply to the

ff case now under consideration.
