The spectrum from 2000 A.U, to about 200 A.U. has been photographed by the method
already described for the following 20 elements : Carbon, calcium, titanium, vanadium,
chromium, manganese, cobalt, arsenic, molybdenum, cadmium, tin, antimony, tellurium,
cerium, platinum, gold, thallium, lead, bismuth and uranium. The wave-lengths
measured and given in the following Tables are reduced to vacuo, and the spectra are
shown in Plates 25 and 26 in the order above given.

Tn all cases where the results of other investigators were available these have been
placed in parallel columns for easy comparison. An exception to this should be men-
tioned. In the case of chromium the recently published values by Miutrkan and BowEn*
appear to have no correspondence whatever to the values recorded here, in spite of the
fact that the wave-lengths of known lines, such as carbon, were determined as accurately
on our chromium plates as on almost any others.

Second-order lines have been eliminated from these tables, except in the case of carbon,
in which case all lines which appeared on the carbon plates have been retained, second-
order lines being indicated by the symbols 8.0. In cases where some doubt exists the
same symbols are used, but followed by an interrogation mark. The wave numbers
of second-order lines have been omitted. It will be noticed that in a few cases certain
lines appear, from this work, to be second-order lines which have been recorded as first-
order by others. The grating used in this work appears to give about equal intensity
in the first- and second-order, and this has rendered the identification of faint second-order
lines somewhat uncertain.
