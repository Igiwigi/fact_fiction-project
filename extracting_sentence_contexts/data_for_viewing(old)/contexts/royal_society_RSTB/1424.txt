in question.

So far as the anatomical evidence is concerned, there is no reason why ast
the Calamostachys type should not have been borne on the stem of a Ca
as we have described in the first part of this paper. The differences in s
no greater than we should be prepared to find between the axis of a fructifie:
a vegetative stem, and no greater than we actually do find between bre
different order in one and the same species of Equisetum. In some point
such as the presence of an intercellular space at the protoxylem of each bu
the structure of the nodal wood, the agreement is even surprisingly close,

We have, however, to take account of the fact that a fructification of a. |
type has been proved, in previous memoirs, to have been that of a Calami
first specimen of this fructification was described in 1869.* Long subseque
and more complete specimens were discovered, and a full account of the wholes
was laid before the Royal Society in 1887. We have re-examined the sp ec
the purposes of the present paper, but, except in one point, have nothing t
the previous descriptions.

A summary, however, of the facts relating to this fructification must be gi
for the sake of comparison with the structure of Calamostachys.

The strobilus of the “ Calamitean” fructification was pedunculate, and con
an axis bearing numerous whorls of bracts, which were coherent for some
