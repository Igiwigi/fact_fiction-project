‘a a monatomic gas, is transmitted at the same rate as the translational energy. When,
= in 1902, ScuwAnrzx obtained the values of f for argon and helium, and found them
B. nearly equal to 3, the conclusion to be drawn was not obvious. It certainly
-2 contradicted Mryer’s theory, but left the question open as to whether the analysis, or
% the assumption of the rigid elastic spherical model, was at fault ; also if f= 3 indicated
> that the molecules are Maxwellian, the failure of the corresponding law connecting
= » and T remained unexplained. It should be remembered, moreover, that the law
£& ««T"’ for rigid elastic spherical molecules is equally contradictory to experiment.
g These difficulties were removed by the theorem of my former paper, according to
& which J is an invariable constant $ for all monatomic molecules. This is now seen to
% be incorrect as a general theorem, but the deviations found for the various particular
§ molecular models discussed leaves little room for doubt that fis very nearly equal to
8 in the case of all likely models. The fact simply is, therefore, that f is very
© unsuitable as a means of discrimination between different models, and ScHWARZE’s
observations indicate some mathematical fallacy in Meyer’s theory, without supporting
any particular molecular model. The observed values of f are hardly known with
sufficient accuracy to enable any conclusion to be drawn from a slight divergence
from the value §, within the limits prescribed in (249) to (251). They are important,
however, as confirming the general validity of the kinetic theory, apart from any .
hypothesis as to the nature of the molecules.

The following table contains all the available data concerning the value of / for
monatomic gases. Only very recently has the conductivity of neon been deter-
mined, owing to the scarcity of the gas; for krypton and xenon its value is still
unknown.
