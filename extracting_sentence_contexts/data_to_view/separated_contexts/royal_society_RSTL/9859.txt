The values of 0 in Experiment 14 will be most deereased, but the alteration in the
value of 0 in the second line of Experiment 1 will be much greater than the alteration
of the value of 0 in the first line, while the change in the values of 6 in Experiment 14
will be much the same for the two. Thus, by decreasing Þ the differences will be
decreased throughout, bub the changes will be greatesb when the angles of incidence
are large. Thus a decrease in Þ will increase the differences between the theory and
experiment,

Hence considering the ordinary and extraordinary rays together, a change in Þ will
not reconcile the facts observed. Calculation shows that decreasing Þ by 30” decreases the differences in Experiments
4, 11, and 14 by 6', 4", and 1' 20” respectively for the extraordinary ray, and the
amounts are about the same for the ordinary. We must now consider alterations in X; putting tan P=K we have for the ordinary
ray
