sult which seems to shew, that nitrogene is not formed during
the electrical decomposition and recomposition of water, and
that the residual gas is hydrogene. That the hydrogene is
in excess, may be easily referred to a slight oxidation of the
platina,

The refined experiments of Mr. Cavenpisn on the defla-
gration of mixtures of oxygene, hydrogene, and nitrogene,
lead directly to the conclusion, that the nitrous acid sometimes
generated in experiments on the production of water, owes
its origin to nitrogene, mixed with the oxygene and hydro-
gene, and is never produced from those two gasses alone. In
the Bakerian lecture for 1806, I have stated several facts,
which seem to shew that the nitrous acid, which appears in
many processes of the VorTatc electrization of water, cannot
be formed, unless nitrogene be present.

Though in these experiments I endeavonred to guard witly
great care against all causes of mistake, and though I do-not
well sce how I could fall into an error, yet I find'that the as-
sertion, that both acids and alkalies may be produced from
pure water, has again been repeated. * The energy with
which the large VorTaic apparatus, recently constructed in
the Royal Institution, acts upon water, enabled me to put this
question to'a more decided test, than was before in'my power.
