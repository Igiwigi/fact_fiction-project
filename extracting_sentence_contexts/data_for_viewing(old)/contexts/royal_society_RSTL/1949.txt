The functions, in s/eep, seem to be diminished, and that in the same order.
This is particularly seen in the deep lethargy of the hedgehog. The animal
becomes quiescent ; then it nearly ceases to respire ; then the action of the pan-
niculus carnosus yields to partial relaxation ; lastly, the heart beats with a reptile
slowness. In ordinary sleep, the muscles which retain the eye open lose their
powers, and the eyelids close by an act of the reflex function, just as they are
kept closed in the anencephalous infant. The eye is only partially closed,
even during sleep, in cases of extreme languor and exhaustion, with diminished
energy of the reflex function. Volition is first impaired, and the eyelids close ;
the reflex function next fails, and the eyelids close partially only.

It appears probable that the facts of this paper may lead to some important
additions to our knowledge of anatomy, by inducing an accurate inquiry into

the origin, course, connexion, and distribution of the subcutaneous, or sub-
mucous, and muscular nerves, which constitute the arcs of the reflex function.
There can be no doubt that a system of nerves takes its origin from the
lower portion of the spinal marrow, to supply the sphincters and the organs of
generation, which may be compared to those which concentre in the medulla
