The normal form we have introduced depends not only on the groups G, and H but also
on the systems S,, of left coset representatives which we have chosen in G,. But the method
for finding the normal form of the elements of P, which we have just described, shows that
the length of the normal form does not depend on the choice of the S, but only on the
element of the group itself; we may therefore call it the length of the element:

Corotiary. [fn>1, if Di Oy opera 2h,
and if no two successive factors g,, g;,, are elements of the same group G.,, then n is the length of p. If
n= 1, the length of p is 0 or 1 according as p lies in H or not. (3-2)

The process we have described for computing the normal form of an element of P does
not depend on the fact that P is the generalized free product of the G,. If P is an arbitrary
group containing subgroups G,, such that any two different such subgroups intersect in
a fixed group H, then we can choose systems S,, of left coset representatives of the G, modulo
H and define normal words as before. If the element pe P belongs to the subgroup of P
generated by all the G,—and only then—it can be written in the form

with each g, lying in a group G,, and no two successive ones in the same. The process
described above then assigns to / a well-defined normal word (of length n, ifn >1; of length

which represents /. If P is not generated by the G,, then there will be elements of P which
are not represented by any normal word; and if P is not the generalized free product of the
