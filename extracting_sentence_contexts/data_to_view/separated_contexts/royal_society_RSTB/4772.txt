Such a
culture. in section, shows closely packed strands of rounded, oval or cubical cells of
large size and a not very deeply staining cytoplasm. Their character, in fact, is definitely
embryonic and indifferent—so much so that these cells would afford no clue to the
type of epithelium from which they were derived to one who had not followed the history
of their derivation. Adult lung, w vitro, rapidly dedifferentiates, and, in so doing, it
frequently passes through a stage in which its elements are strikingly “ foetal” in
appearance, owing to the small alveolar cavities and the thickened epithelial cells lining
them. This seems to be the pulmonary counterpart of reversed development described
by CHampy (8) in cultures of adult kidney.
