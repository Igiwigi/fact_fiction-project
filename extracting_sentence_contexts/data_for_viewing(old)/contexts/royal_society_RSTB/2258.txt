here the hand may be considered supreme in sentiency of skin and nicety of action,
it might be imagined that the pre-eminence of functional delicacy and of polymeric
character of nerve-supply were determinate one of the other. That the two features
may be correlated I should be the last to deny, but I fail to find proof of a causal
nexus between them in the sense that one is result of the other. The overlap is
as great in the skin of the back of the hand as it is in the palm, yet touch, as tested
by localising power, is far the greater in the latter. It is medius not index which
possesses the triple nerve-root supply, though medius is less sentient than index.
The skin of the concha is not in Macacus apparently at all specially sentient, yet
its sensory innervation is in part as regards nerve pairs a quadruple one. I am
more inclined to connect the greater overlap in the hand and foot with degree of

‘ Lorze’s “local sign” and with the fact, indicated by the arrangement of the nerve-
fields, that they lie approximately in the region of the lateral line of the animal as
do the nipple and external auditory meatus, a line along which the amount of
overlap seems to be great, perhaps as a heritage trom old ancestral structure.

Examined by the degeneration method a somewhat greater degree of overlapping
of root-distribution to the muscles of the limb is evidenced than examination by
