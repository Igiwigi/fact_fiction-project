show that the smaller model B leads to an overestimate of the C-CH3 and -CH2-H BDEs at the
diamond [100] surface, due to the lack of steric hindrance at the surface. In this respect, models C
and D should be closer to the energies that we would expect at the surface of the diamond slab.
The data in table 2 suggest that this is in fact the case, as the calculated bond energies appear
to be converging to a limit as the system size increases. Note that the B3LYP bond energies are
smaller than the B3LYP-D3 energies (especially for BDE(C-C)), owing to neglect of the attractive
dispersive interactions between the methyl radical and the surface. A similar effect can also be
seen for the C-C bond energy of neopentane in table 1. It is also worth noting that B3LYP-D3
underestimates the neopentane BDEs compared to both the experimental and the CCSD(T)-F12
values (both of which are in good agreement). Assuming that B3LYP-D3 makes a similar
underestimate in the bond energy at the diamond [100] surface, our best estimates of the surface
C-—CH3 BDEs and CH,—H BDEs (based on the model D B3LYP-D3 value and the difference
between the B3LYP-D3 and CCSD(T)-F12 neopentane values) are 86.6 and 93.6 kcal mol!,
respectively.
