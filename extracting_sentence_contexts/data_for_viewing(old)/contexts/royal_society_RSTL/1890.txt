h : Ist, e muscle, which is green, and
occupies nearly the anterior half of the operculum : 2ndly, on the left of the
sear (that is, when the operculum is turned with its inner side towards the ob-
server,) a triangular pale brown spot, occupying the margin of the extremity,
and eas portion of the last yolution : and 3rdly, a black and polished
posterior portion.

There can be no doubt, as these divisions of the operculum agree in shape
with the three parts obseryed in the disk, that they are seyerally deposited by
them; and on further examination it appears that the volutions are in fact
formed of three coats, each deposited by one of these parts. The new layers
are first added to the extremity of the whorls by the small triangular fleshy
band placed on the right side of the muscle. Afterwards, as the operculum
is movyed round in order to present a new end to the influence of the fleshy
band, the newly formed part is covered by a black coat, secreted by the pro-
cess of the back of the foot which extends up the right side of the band. Both
these layers are eventually covered by a green coat, which is deposited by the
surface of the muscle, and the part of this latter coat which is left exposed as
the operculum turns round on its axis, is again covered by a second thin black
$hining coat, deposited by the posterior part of the disk, or that which is formed
of the elevated portion of the back of the foot.
