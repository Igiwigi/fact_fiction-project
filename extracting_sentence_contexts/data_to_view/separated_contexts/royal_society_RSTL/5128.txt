In newly-
formed bone situated near ossifying cartilage, the Haversian spaces are exceedingly
numerous and large, frequently affording room for the development of two or more
systems (fig. 5, Plate VI. fig. 24, Plate VIII.), while in older bone they are far less
numerous, and generally less in size. In no case, however, are they wholly absent,
They are found even in the bones of old subjects, and in connection with them newly
developed systems. This is a very important fact, as it demonstrates that the old tissue is removed in
masses, and a new one developed in its place. It has long been taught that the
older particles of an internal tissue are removed by absorption and new ones substi-
tuted, and this throughout the life of the individual. But the authors believe that
they have demonstrated it for the first time.
