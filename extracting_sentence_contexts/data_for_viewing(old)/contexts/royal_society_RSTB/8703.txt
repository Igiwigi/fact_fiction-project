the viewer's primary motor (M1) cortex, evident from the suppression of the

imitation approximately 20Hz motor-cortex rhythm [1]; the motor-cortex activation

during observation is, however, considerably weaker than that during own actions.
Author for correspondence: Executed and observed movements are commonly considered to be associated
Riitta Hari with activations in overlapping motor brain areas that form nodes of ‘mirroring

systems’ (for reviews, see e.g. [2,3]), and one may thus wonder how it is possible
to prevent imitation of every seen action.

In fact, some neurological patients, mainly suffering from frontal-lobe lesions,
may become ‘echopractic’, imitating basically every action they see without being
instructed so. The mechanisms of inhibition of undesired imitation are still largely
unknown, although they, on the basis of patient studies, likely reflect released
inhibition by the frontal lobes to more posterior, mainly parietal brain areas [4].

Bien et al. [5] ina combined functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and
transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) study in healthy subjects provided brain-
level support for the idea [4] that automatic and intentional imitation have different
This study has previously been presented in neuronal bases. In their model, Bien and co-workers proposed that the right pre-
motor cortex is involved in automatic imitation and the input it receives from the
right middle/inferior frontal lobe leads to inhibition of imitation. The other regions
in the circuitry were assumed to be the parietal cortices in both hemispheres and
