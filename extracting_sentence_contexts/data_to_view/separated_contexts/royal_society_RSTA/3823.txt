* But a better instance of this is the broad open valley on the south side of
the Soufriare, between that mountain and the Morne Garu. It is a significant fact
that there is no good road from the leeward to the windward side over the mountains,
and that the only passable footpath was an old Carib track which started from
Chateaubelair and went to Georgetown. It led right up to the edge of the crater of
the Soufri√©re before descending on the other side, an ascent of 3000 feet. It stuck to the
summits of the spurs between the valleys, where the vegetation was least dense, and
there was least probability of a wash-out due to the sudden rains and floods.
