OF
course, this system does not lead to a finite speed for heat pulse propagation, but it may be
useful in practical applications if t2; Â« 14), in the regime when the frequency of perturbation
is higher than 1/1; but lower than 1/t;. Combining (2.5) with the energy balance equation
leads to an evolution equation for the temperature analogous to the equation obtained from
a two-temperature model, namely, assuming the system is composed of two interpenetrating
materials, each one with its own local temperature, and exchanging heat between them in a way
proportional to the difference of their temperatures [6]. It is worth recalling this fact because it
illustrates that some macroscopic equations may arise from very different microscopic models;
indeed, equation (2.5) may follow from the kinetic theory of phonons (with a specially remarkable
contribution of the momentum-conserving collisions) [6,7,41] and the kinetic theory of electrons,
but its combination with the energy balance equation may be very similar to such a different
model as a mixture of phonons and electrons, or of a light gas and a heavy gas, or of two
interpenetrating solids. Some of the differences between rational extended thermodynamics (RET) and extended
irreversible thermodynamics (EIT), are, for instance, that RET requires the system of equations


to have the form of balance laws, local in space (i.e. the non-local effects are only related to the
divergence of the corresponding flux), and to be symmetric hyperbolic, thus leading to finite
speeds of propagation [7,17]. From a thermodynamic perspective, the interest of this restriction is
that mathematical theorems on these kinds of systems allow one to prove in purely mathematical
terms the existence of a supplementary balance law for a quantity whose production term has a
definite (positive) sign, thus allowing us to identify it as an entropy related to the main fields
[7].
