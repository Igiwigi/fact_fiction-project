be of the length and breadth correlation ?
Table IL. (a), Ry, case (j) gives us at once the result—

To5 = °0033.

In other words, the correlation between length and breadth would be sensibly
destroyed by such a selection. Thus correlation can be created or destroyed or
reversed by selection.

The above illustrations, hypothetical though they may be, will suffice to indicate
how entirely dependent correlation is upon selection. We must look upon coefficients
of correlation, in fact, as just as much the outcome of selection as coefficients of
variation, standard-deviations, or even the mean size of organs. No selection can
take place, in the sense in which it has usually been understood to take place—i.c.,
by a change of mean and of variability, without at the same time the means,
variabilities and the correlations of all correlated, but not directly selected, organs
being varied. This is true whether the non-selected organs be initially correlated or
not among themselves. We must always bear in mind this all-important funda-
mental conception, that natural or artificial selection, or even random sampling, are
in themselves active factors in the modification (7.e., creation, destruction, or reversal)
of correlation, Thus not only is the impossibility of the constancy of correlation
for local races obvious, but the primary importance of insuring that our samples are
representative, and not accidentally selected samples, in all observations or experiments
on heredity, homotyposis, or organic correlation becomes more and more manifest.
