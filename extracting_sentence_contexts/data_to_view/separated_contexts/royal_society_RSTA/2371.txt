Intermediate values will be found in erystals in
which slip has taken place at some previous instant, and in which the continued strain
is renewing the process of elastic deformation, which will gradually increase until fresh
dislocations occur. The whole process is consistent with a reduced external load, or
average stress, and will probably continue until the dislocations and slip planes are
sufficient in number to restrict to some extent the freedom of the intervening atomic
structure, when the yielding process will end, and a rising stress will accompany further
strain. The fact that after removal and re-application of load during the yielding process
flow again takes place at the lower yield stress (fig. 6) may readily be explained on this
view. Removal of load will be accompanied by removal of the elastic deformation,
or even reversal in the case of grains carrying little stress at the moment of removal. The displacements due to slip will be unaffected except possibly for small adjustments
that may take place.
