plants, is that usually denominated a * fibre.” And the appearance of the filament
in all the structures mentioned, was essentially such as that delineated in the figures
above referred to : an appearance which I have never before seen represented as that
of © fibre.”

12. Most of the figures which accompany the memoir present filaments, having
the appearance in question. It will be seen to be precisely such as that of the filament
formed within the corpuscle of the blood. We know that discoid corpuscles circulate
in plants ; and it remains to be seen whether filaments are not formed in these.

The foregoing facts, I think, indicate the necessity in physiological research, of not
resting satisfied with mere opinion, though emanating from 80 high an authority as
HunTeR; who supposed the corpuscles to be © the least important portion of the
blood.”

Structure of the Flat Filament (© Fibre”) more particularly investigated.

13. We have hitherto viewed the object called by me a flat filament, only in some
of its minutest forms. These are sufficient to show that it is a compound structure.
But in order to become more particularly acquainted with this structure, it is requi-
Site to trace the filament into similar objects of larger size. For this purpose, it will
be sufficient to examine sccessively the following figures, from neryous substance,
from muscle, and from the crystalline lens : namely, figs. 117 , 116 , 115 B, 114 B,
