Solar System birth, star formation, considering what we know of it and of similar

systems nowadays in formation. However, when it
comes to studying the presence of energetic particles
in young forming stars, we encounter the classical

astrochemistry, cosmic-ray ionization

Author for correspondence: problem of the impossibility of directly detecting
Cecilia Ceccarelli them toward the emitting source (analogously to
e-mail: cecilia.ceccarelli@univ- what happens to galactic cosmic rays). Yet, exploiting

the fact that energetic particles, such as cosmic rays,
create H3t and that an enhanced abundance of H3~
causes dramatic changes on the overall gas chemical
composition, we can indirectly estimate the flux
of energetic particles. This contribution provides
an overview of the search for solar-like protostars
