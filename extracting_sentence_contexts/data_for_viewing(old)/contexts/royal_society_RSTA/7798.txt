will be required later when we discuss the particular integrals.

The functions G,, G," and H,” are solutions of the equation

ee, ok ce oes, FS)

while the functions e* G,, eG,” and e*H,.” satisfy the equation (3.4).

We are only concerned at present with those solutions of (3.4) which tend to
zero as r tends to infinity, remain finite for all values of 0, and have period 2z in w.
The functions ¢"G,, eG,", and eH,” provide all the solutions satisfying these
conditions, if n takes all positive integral values, including zero, and m takes all
positive integral values such that m = n, this restriction being due to the fact that
P,” (cos 6) vanishes if m > n.

The typical solutions for u,, v, w. are the functions e“G,, eG,", and e*H,". Our
problem is to find combinations of these solutions such that (3.2) is satisfied.
With this object in view, we shall first obtain formulae expressing the partial deri-
vatives of the typical solutions with respect to x, », and z in terms of other typical
solutions. With the help of these formulae we shall then obtain four series of values
of uz, V2, #2 Which satisfy (3.2). Finally, we shall show that these four series include
all possible solutions of the system of equations (3.4) and (3.2).
