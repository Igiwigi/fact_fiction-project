Thus, given the study of the rectal temperature of a
healthy man, in whom the variations in temperature would presumably not exceed
1° C., resistances are intercalated which permit of 100 or even 120 mm. to correspond
with 1° C. On the other hand, in the case of fever patients, in which the
temperature may vary several degrees in 24 hours, such resistance must be
introduced into the circuit as will permit of the whole excursion of the curve falling
within a height of 200 mm. ‘

past, listened to the actual results of medical and pathological observations of
importance, that I should wish to enter in detail into the results of the actual
observations which I have carried out by means of the method of automatic
photographic registration which I have described, for, as is indicated by the title
of this paper, I am dealing at present with methods rather than with results. I may,
however, be permitted to point out and to illustrate by certain of the curves which
I have obtained, that the method of photographic registration has revealed the fact
that the temperature of the body in any given region is ceaselessly changing, and in
a manner hitherto unsuspected, doubtless in consequence of constant changes in the
activity of the great vaso-motor centre and its subordinates. These changes are
much more strikingly seen in the curves of the diurnal changes in the rectal
temperature of a healthy man, which are not reproduced in this paper, but which will

be subsequently published. Il.—Onw tHe Mernop or Quasi-Contrnuous REGISTRATION OF THE CURVE OF THE
