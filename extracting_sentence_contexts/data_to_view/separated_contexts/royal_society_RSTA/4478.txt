It will be noticed that the gains are greater for the higher temperatures than for
the lower, and, further, the average gain shows a tendency to increase with increased
length of run. Both facts are explicable on the assumption that the gains are due
to mercury vapour, and it is noteworthy that, calculating from the approximately
known vapour pressure of mercury (LANDOLT and
Bornstern’s tables) and estimating the amount of
air passed (from previous work), the gains are
found to be of the order of the number given from
these data. Exact concordance cannot be expected,
because in all experiments the inverted U-tubes
(fig. 3, p. 186) were brought down as close to the
exit and entry tubes as was practicable. It was therefore decided to test this question
by using a form of joint which avoided the use of
mercury.
