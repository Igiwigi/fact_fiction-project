It appears then from the preceding article, that for every function of z
of the degree m, there [exists a homogeneous quadratic function of (m—1) variables,
the inertia of which augmented. by unity will represent; the number of real roots in
the given function. Now this inertia itself may be measnred by the number of posi-
