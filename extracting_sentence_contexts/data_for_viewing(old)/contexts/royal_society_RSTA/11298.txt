¢ deduces an index of 1:0000275 for infinitely long waves for sodium vapour saturated

S absolute atomic refractivity of sodium.

5 The relative values for different wave-lengths are, of course, independent of the
A density, and in themselves constitute a most interesting exemplification of the
variation of the index in the neighbourhood of an absorption band. Thus, the index
increases from the infra-red to the line D,, where it becomes very large. On the blue
side of D, the index increases rapidly from very small values, but remains less than
unity even as far as \ = 2260.

In view of these facts the investigation of the index of potassium seemed likely to
yield results of similar interest. But, unfortunately, the chemical difficulties proved
so great that, in spite of numerous attempts, it was found impossible to obtain
absolute values with the apparatus employed. At the temperature at which

obtain, in vessels of these materials, a density of the vapour sufficient for a quanti-
