responding, forming a vicious cycle of sorts.

The avoidance habit paradigm discussed earlier in this
article is the only study, to our knowledge, which begins to
test this possibility directly [64]. OCD patients and healthy
controls were asked to provide an explanation for why they
continued to make avoidance responses to the stimulus that
predicted the now devalued outcome. While many patients
used the word ‘habit’ or variants of it (i.e. automaticity) to
describe their actions, a subset reported irrational hypotheses
regarding the task procedure. For example, some patients
reported that they thought they could still be shocked, in
spite of the fact that they had been disconnected from the
offending stimulator. These comments become particularly
illuminating when considered alongside the ratings of
shock expectancy and explicit contingency knowledge tests,
which were taken moments before this qualitative question.
Patients were unimpaired on these tests, reporting very low
likelihood that they could still be shocked following devalua-
tion and having intact knowledge of the contingency

structure of the task. Like obsessions in OCD, these irrational
threat beliefs were discordant with subjects’ knowledge of
the task structure. Although these data were collected in an
exploratory manner, they provide good early evidence in sup-
