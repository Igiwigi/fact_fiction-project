(split for convenience) with conical upper and lower faces. J is a conical plug with a
central hole to let the water through and a plane upper face which makes a watertight
seating in the upper nut L of the fixing. The lower nut F which rests on the carriage
is split and threaded with a deep thread so that by screwing the two parts L and F hard
together a great pressure can be brought to act on the flanged upper portion of the
specimen. The large distortions so produced in the material of the conical flange harden
copper, iron and aluminium to such an extent that when the tube is afterwards stretched

no observable plastic flow takes place in the material of the flange. The stretching in
fact, begins at the corner D where the flange connects with the parallel part of the tube.
The ring R is merely used for holding the two portions of the split nut F in place.

Tt will be noticed that in this description the sleeve C plays no part, it might, in fact,
be part of F, when the apparatus is used in the manner described. When it was used
for soft metals like lead and cadmium which do not harden appreciably by cold work it
was found that the method just described does not ensure that there shall be no flow
inside the material of the flange. In these cases, therefore, a cylindrical steel plug with
a small central hole was made to fit the bore of specimen. â€˜The flat faces of the split
sleeve C were then filed so that when the nut L was screwed home, the soft metal was
gripped between the split sleeve C and the cylindrical plug. In this way it was found
possible to grip lead tube.
