This idea was
founded, I believe, by MM. TrrscA and ST. VixaxT on a long course of experiments
on the punching and squeezing of metals ;* and they speak of a solid being reduced to
the state of fluidity by stresses of a given magnibude. This theory introduces a
discontinuity, since ib has to be determined what parts of the body are reduced to the
state of fluidity and what are not. But apart from this difficulty, there is another
one which is almost insuperable, in the fact that the differential equations of flow are
non-linear. The hope of introducing this form of resistance must be abandoned, and the investi-
gation musb be confined to the inclusion of those two other continuous laws of resistance
to relative displacementâ€”elasticity and viscosity. As above stated, the law of elastico-viscosity assumed in this paper has nob got an
experimental foundation.
