One exemption is min-
erals used as emetics. Here, the action of (toxic) Cu?* and
Zn** ions is used to induce vomiting, which at the same
time eliminates these toxicants from the body. Highly relevant for medicinal purposes is the fact that
some types of clay exhibit bacteriostatic and bactericidal
activity [200]. Chemical effects of clays on bacteria appear
to dominate the antibacterial mechanisms [213,214]. Relevant
mechanisms causing the antibacterial activity of different
minerals and more specifically of clays have been summar-
ized in the excellent review by Williams [201].
