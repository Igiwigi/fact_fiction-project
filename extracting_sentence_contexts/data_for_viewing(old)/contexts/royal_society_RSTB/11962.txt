utility, where r < 1. Conversely, a ‘risk seeking’ individual will
have a convex utility function, with increasing marginal utility,
where r > 1 [69].

The shape of the utility function is of interest to psychiatry
because it provides a computational method for quantifying
the way in which individuals subjectively value positive or
negative outcomes and how this dictates their engagement
with, or avoidance of, uncertainty. For instance, while most
people are somewhat risk averse, a patient with a phobia
may be extremely (pathologically) risk averse [70] and conver-
sely, an individual with a gambling disorder might exhibit
risk-loving behaviour [71]. The fact that we can measure the
curvature of the utility function using simple choice tasks
and that this measure seems to translate to behaviour in
realms other than preferences over gambles suggests that this
can serve as a potentially powerful clinical tool.

4, Theoretical and empirical separation of risk
and time preferences

As alluded to above, traditional approaches to modelling tem-
poral discounting ignore potential nonlinearities in the utility
function, and hence individual differences in risk attitude,
by computing the discount rate while specifically assuming
