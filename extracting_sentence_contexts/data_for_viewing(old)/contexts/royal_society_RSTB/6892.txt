Discussion

The principal conclusions which have emerged from this necessarily somewhat
intricate mass of reasoning and data are the following. In the first place, it has been
shown that a chromosome is fundamentally a contorted structure, which will neither
become straight nor untwist except under special circumstances. Secondly, it has been
fhown that contortions of two orders of size are involved, the one a visible spiral of
microscopic dimensions, the other a submicroscopic convolution, } possibly of molecular
dimensions, since it admits of a very fruitful analogy with keratin. These are the essential
conclusions, but on the assumption that a real analogy exists between the submicro-
scopic structure of the chromosome and the molecular structure of other organic fibres of
which keratin is the best known, it is possible to provide a reasoned seriation of three
otherwise disconnected cytological facts, namely, (1) that the chromosome in the
prophase of meiosis differs from that at mitosis by its length, (2) that extreme elonga-
tion is associated with chromosome pairing wherever it occurs, i.e. in cells as different
as the spore mother cells of a fern and the salivary gland cells of a fly, and (3) that
extreme elongation is followed by supercontraction, in a definite sequence of cause
and effect.

This by no means exhausts either the information which could be extracted or the
range of problems which might be discussed on the basis of the photographs presented.
It seems, however, suitable to close the argument at this point in order to examine
as critically as possible the validity of the facts which have been used. This is par-
ticularly necessary in that some rather fundamental issues have been raised.
