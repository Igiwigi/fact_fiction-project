a, a’, b,c, d be five points of them such that ade are in line, as also a’ed. That is

This sets up a (1,1) correspondence between a and a’, as both vary throughout their

coincide, and the broken line abcd becomes the straight a) b,¢,d).

Hence there are exactly & line transversals of four medials in general, which will
meet D in the & points d), in fact where the scroll #, defined by A, B, C, meets D. This
gives an alternative proof that -# is of order k.

Again the cross-ratios (@)b,¢,d,) on these & transversal lines must evidently be
projective invariants of the four medials.

These ideas and results were given by Mr J. H. Grace (1929) in the course of his
important account of * Double Figures and Rational Normal Curves’.

Ifthe co-ordinate vectors of a, a’, b,c, dare x, &, Yy, 2, (respectively, the analytical form
of the collineation is obtained by eliminating y, z and ¢ from the conditions of col-
linearity,
