animals are removed from the substratum will cause the fused areas to separate (Atkins 1937Â¢).
In the Novaculininae, although the point is nowhere stated in the descriptions because its
significance was not realized by the authors concerned, there can be little doubt, when
comparison is made with conditions in Solecurtus, that the broad band of ventral fusion is
the result of complete fusion of the tissues.

A striking feature is the absence in both species of a cruciform muscle. With the extension
of fusion along the entire ventral surface all reasons for its persistence. must disappear.
No longer necessary as a tie for the siphons in Solecurtus, in the Novaculininae the ventral
fusion has extended so far forward that it is also no longer needed to reinforce the ventral
attachment between the shell valves. Finally, anterior migration beyond a certain point
will place it beyond the zone where it can be affected by the movements of the siphons so
that the sense organ will become useless. Significant also in this connexion is the fact that
the siphons cannot completely be withdrawn. Starting from conditions generally similar to

those now existing in Tagelus, the evolution both of Solecurtus and of the Novaculininae may
be postulated on somewhat divergent lines, as indicated in figure 20. In Solecurtus (figure
206), ventral fusion of the inner lobes of the mantle edges extends both posteriorly and
anteriorly, so that the siphons appear to be fused at their bases while anteriorly the pedal
opening is reduced, the cruciform muscle being retained. In the Novaculininae (figure 20c)
there is no posterior fusion, but anteriorly this extends along the entire ventral surface and
the cruciform muscle is lost. Conditions in this subfamily appear to provide additional
