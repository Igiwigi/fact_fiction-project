refusing to rise in the air and float away as an ordinary cloud would certainly do.
This, in fact, merely postpones the difficulties, and does not settle them. Moreover, if
such an explanation were possible at Pelée, it would have no bearing whatever on the
eruptions of the Soufriére, as there the crater is a vast bowl about half as deep as it
is broad ; the black cloud could never have been shot obliquely from the bottom of
this, down the mountain side, but must have risen nearly vertically into the air,

The explanation proposed by Professor Jaccart is of a different kind: “ These
horizontal blasts are not hard to account for, and do not require a horizontal nozzle
to project them. They are simply the effect of the down blast after the heavy gravel
has begun to fall, acting against the upblast from the throat of the volcano, and both
together deflected and thrown into terrific whirls or tornadoes by the prevailing wind,
which on Mont Pelée is north-east.” He would, in fact, account for them by the
resistance which the sand and lapilli falling through the air offered to the ascent of
subsequent discharges. Mr. E. O. Hovey has adopted this hypothesis without
essential modification.

But, in our opinion, this is quite incompetent to explain the behaviour of the black
clouds we saw on the night of the 9th of July. Before the first black cloud arose no
very great amount of dust had been projected into the air, and the steam clouds were
drifting steadily westwards before the trade wind towards Précheur. Before and
after the appearance of the black cloud the steam ascended freely and apparently
without hindrance. The black cloud took a different path, and once it had rolled a
short way down to the mountain there was nothing above it to prevent it rising
in the air ; but it hugged the surface of the ground so closely that the conclusion was
