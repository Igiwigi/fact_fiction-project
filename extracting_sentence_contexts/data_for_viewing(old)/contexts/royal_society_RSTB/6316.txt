TOOTH-REPLACEMENT IN THERIODONT REPTILES 127

young forms the posterior three teeth are situated below the orbit, only the last
tooth occupies that position in the oldest. Another point of interest is in the position
of the quadrates which occupy a much more posterior position in the young than they
do in the older forms. This position of the quadrate, together with that of the last
post-canines, and the fact that the young have a relatively small nose, suggests that
it would be hard to distinguish them from the young of Wythosaurus.

(b) Tooth-replacement

The first indication that the manner of the replacement of the post-canine teeth
could be seen in these forms was noticed in specimen F. This is the second specimen
that was described in 1933 when the presence of seven teeth in the left side was
noted and the suggestion made that the extra tooth was actually the fourth.
