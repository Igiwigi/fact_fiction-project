It is shown that the distribution of the eggs by the parasite is not at random, but
has reference to the nature of the hosts available at the time. The female usually selects
unparasitized hosts, and, if forced to superparasitize, chooses those hosts containing

the youngest parasite stage. It is suggested that the graded oviposition response of the
females towards hosts containing advancing developmental stages of the parasite may
be conveniently correlated with the decreasing quantity of actual host material present
within the host egg-shell rather than with a quantitative increase in intensity of move-
ments of parasite larvae, etc. This is supported by the fact that hosts containing dead
second and third instars of the larvae are rejected to an extent comparable with those
hosts containing similar live larval instars. However, as a decreasing host quantity is
accompanied by corresponding maturing parasite stages, the characters of these latter
are also of significance.

If only parasitized hosts are accessible the female tends to retain her eggs rather than
deposit them. The exercise of this restraint is shown to be related to:

(1) the developmental stage of the parasite in the parasitized host;
(2) the age and condition of the ovary of the female;

(3) the number and nature of the hosts available.
