When the object is inserted in the beam at a distance z)q upstream of the detector edge, two
effects usually take place: the overall beam intensity is reduced in amplitude owing to absorption
inside the object, and the beam is shifted vertically by refraction (figure 1b,c). This leads to the
following expression for the intensity incident on the detector, for a given position of the edge [19]:

Tob),+ Yedge) = Tlo «C+ (Yedge — Zod * Ay), (3.2)

where we have assumed the transmission T and the refraction angle A@y to be constant within the
size of the pre-sample slit. Let us now consider the case of negligible object absorption and small


refraction angles, the latter hypothesis being motivated by the fact that the aim of this analysis
is to estimate the sensitivity of EI to weak object details. Under this assumption, the illumination
function can be linearly approximated around Yedge:

Tobj,+ (Yedge) ~ Io - [C+Yedge) + C4. Yedge)44y], (3.3)

where C’, (Yedge) is the first derivative of Cy. (Yedge) with respect to the refraction angle. Finally, by
combining equation (3.3) with the definition of the edge SNR in equation (2.1), and by assuming
pure statistical noise, the following expression is obtained:
