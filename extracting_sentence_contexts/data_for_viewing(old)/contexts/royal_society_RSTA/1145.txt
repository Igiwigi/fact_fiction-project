Figure 9. Schematic view of the different adsorption on Ni(111) when the molecule (GUA) is adsorbed in (a) parallel (0°),
(6) 45°and (c) perpendicular (90°) form. (Online version in colour.)

precisely, we investigated the most stable surfaces of Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Pd and Pt according to their
intermediate adsorption energies of H and O. GUA molecule was placed at different adsorption
positions (0°, 45° and 90°) on the TMs selected as shown in figure 9 (see electronic supplementary
material, table $33).

As shown in table 1, the weakest adsorption is at a 90° angle between the surface and the
aromatic ring of the substrate, while the strongest is at 0° (electronic supplementary material,
table S33). This is due to the fact that the aromatic ring in the guaiacol is characterized by a cloud
