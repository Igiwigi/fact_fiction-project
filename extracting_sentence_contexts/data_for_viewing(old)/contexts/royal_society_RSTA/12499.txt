a systematic character; they are all positive (actuality the greater), and all but one
affect the higher H. W. about the time when the moonâ€™s parallax is small. This
defect is doubtless due to the imperfect representation of the elliptic, evectional, and
variational tides inherent to my method.

228 PROFESSOR G. H. DARWIN ON TIDAL PREDICTION.

The slight superiority shown over the mechanical prediction must be attributed to
the fact that I have used better values of the tidal constants than were available in
1883, when the Indian predictions must have been made.

T learn from Colonel Hitt that two independent observers reading the same tide-
curve will frequently differ by 5" and sometimes by 10" in their estimate of the time,
and by 1 and sometimes by 2 inches in the height. Accordingly, predictions which
agree with a reading of a tide-curve with probable errors of 64" in time and 1 inch in
height may claim to possess a high order of accuracy.

I conclude from the preceding discussion that with good values of the tidal constants
the present method leads to excellent predictions, and that they are even better than
are required for nautical purposes,
