Dispersion results were obtained from a combination of integrated current and short-scale
dispersion processes. They reveal mechanisms from short to large scale such as turbulence, gyres,
residual currents and wind effects.

At scales of hours to a few days, instantaneous currents properly explain the variability
and complexity of the dispersion measured around the La Hague Cape. A particularity of the
Alderney Race that was revealed by scale models and measurements is that it represents a
divergence zone for long-term water mass trajectories. This has been explained by Lagrangian
residual currents simulated by [19]. This results in different behaviours of the water masses
depending on the starting time of a survey or a dissolved tracer. An example of this is given
by drifting buoys trajectories obtained in [5]. When dropped at the same initial position, two
buoys followed opposite trajectories as described by Lagrangian residual trajectories. In fact,
with the same starting position, a different starting time can mean that buoys are launched in
water masses distant of up to 30 km. These different water masses could have completely different
behaviour in the Alderney Race zone. This particular feature concerns the long-term behaviour


of dispersed pollutants. This was confirmed and applied to simulate the dissolved radioactive
dispersion [9,10,39].

4. Discussion

The results obtained for the Alderney Race and particularly around the La Hague Cape highlight
certain particular hydrodynamic processes that are difficult to observe elsewhere. These particular
