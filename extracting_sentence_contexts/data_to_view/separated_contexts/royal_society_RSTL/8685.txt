Powdered alum, Powdered rock-salt,

or reduced, 100 345 16:3

As will be seen on reference to par. 203, the ratio between the black disk and the
plate of rock-salt was 100:3. Powdering the rock-salt has therefore increased the
action 13-3 per cent. The much larger action of the powdered alum is probably due
to the fact that crushing the crystals facilitates efflorescence in vacuo.

206. The alum and rock-salt plates were removed, a fresh .alum plate ground and
polished, and this and the rock-salt were coated with lampblack. They were then put
into the apparatus as before, the black side being away from the source of radiation, 80
that the rays would have to pass through the crystal plates before meeting with the
lampblack.
