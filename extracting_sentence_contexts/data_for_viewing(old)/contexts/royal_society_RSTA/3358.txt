The resulting multiplier (m(&,)/®(E,n))m'(n,o) is regular, so one can now analyse cubic
integrals of this type using again the method of space-time resonances. An important algebraic
observation, which is used in the analysis of the phases 6__,,®_,;—,® ~~ to control the
weighted norms, is the identity

Ve(E,n,0)=0 if Vnob(E,n,0)=0 and |nl,/§-o1<él- (3.17)

This is a slow propagation of iterated resonances property; more subtle versions of this property are
also important in the three-dimensional gravity—capillary model described below (e.g. (3.53)).
The dispersive analysis in [71] is simplified by the fact that there are no quadratic space-time
resonances in the problem. However, the basic idea of the method of space-time resonances,
namely to identify these points and centre the analysis around them, plays a crucial role in many


other global regularity results on plasma models and water waves models. Further developments
of these ideas, and much more sophisticated arguments, are used in the proof global regularity for
the three-dimensional gravity—capillary model, where one has to deal with a full set of quadratic
space-time resonances (see §3d).

We consider now the system (1.7) in one dimension in the case (g,) = (1,0). Global regularity
