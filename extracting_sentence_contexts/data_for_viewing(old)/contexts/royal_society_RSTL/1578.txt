which opens into a large gland on the side of the thoracic

there is a trunk equally large on the opposite side, which
makes an angle, and then terminates in the thoracic duct, This
fact I ascertained at the Veterinary College, assisted by the
Deputy Professor Mr. SEWELL, and Mr. CLirr. These lym-
phatic vessels are equally large as the excretory ducts of any
other glands, and therefore sufficient to carry off the secretion
formed in the cells of the spleen ; and where a secretion is to
be carried into the thoracic duct, it would be a deviation from
the general plan of the animal economy, were any but lym-
phatic vessels employed for that purpose.

It is a strong circumstance in favour of the secretion being
