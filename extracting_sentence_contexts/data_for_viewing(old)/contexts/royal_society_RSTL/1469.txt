with every other muscle of the body, are not only incapable
of compensating for these losses, but cannot even perform
their wonted action, an4 thus necessarily have considerable
influence in impairing vision. Again, does not the habit of
long sight s0 remarkable in sailors and sportsmen, who are
much accustomed to view objects at a great distance, and
that of short sight, as of watchmakers, seal-cutters, &c. admit
of an easy solution upon this principle? as we know of no
part of the body 80 susceptible of an habitual action as the
muscular fibre.

Secondly. How are we to account for the weaker action of one
eye in the case of squinting? That this is the fact has been
well ascertained ; Dr. Reip * upon this subject observes, that
he has examined above twenty persons that squinted, and
found in all of them a defect in the sight of one eye. Por-
TERFIELD and Jukix have made the same observation.

The distorted pocition of the eye has, I believe, been gene-
rally attributed to the external muscles ; but no satisfactory
reason has ever been given why the eye, directed towards an
object, does not see it distinctly at the same distance as with
the other. The state of the iris here cannot explain it, as it
contracts and dilates in common with the other ; nor can we
suppose any muscles the lens might possess could have any
