With nickel 2-18 per cent. and gold 0-75 per cent. in specimen 22/C.2-2, there is a
lowering of the critical ranges of about 40°, the ranges also being widened by about
20° ; both these facts are about what might be expected from the nickel addition alone,
so that the gold has apparently had no material effect. (k) Thermal Expansion. It is one of the advantages of the dilatometric method of determining critical
temperature ranges that it provides at the same time information as to the coefficients
of thermal expansion at various temperatures.
