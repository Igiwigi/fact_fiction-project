It therefore seemed doubtful whether Hysort’s
interpretation of his specimens taken in summer as being first year larve could
be correct, since if this were the case one would have expected to find much smaller
specimens in winter. There was, however, the possibility that both Husorr’s
summer specimens and our winter specimens were in their first year, but if so, it
had to be presumed that a regular production of ova and larve took place all the
year round, so that not the season, but the locality, 7.e., the distance from the site of
production, would be responsible for the size of the larvee. There were, however,
several facts which spoke against the theory of such uninterrupted production, as, for
instance, the periodicity in the occurrence and metamorphosis of the larvee which I
had discovered on board the ‘‘ Thor” in 1905-06. The net result, then, of our investigations by the close of 1912 was that a great
deal more research work would be needed, since the new data obtained had practically
raised. new difficulties in the way of an interpretation—as, indeed, often happens when
an investigation has passed beyond the earliest stages, when the paucity of facts
gives freer play to the imagination. The year 1913 was marked by important progress.
