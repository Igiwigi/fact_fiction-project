stream conditions of Example 7 were assumed, and the gap between planing surface and
horizontal bottom (8, §38) was deduced by computation; a multiplying factor 24/3 x 100
was employed, and here too the net had to be graded in order to determine S with precision.
On the finest nets (parts of which are reproduced) #-values were computed to one or two
more significant figures.

The question of wave-formation downstream

42. In both of Examples 7 and 8, the stream having passed the rigid barrier falls steadily
to the lower of the two levels which are associated, according to § 10, with any particular

rate of flow. We had expected to find solutions characterized by standing waves on the
downstream side, but none in fact was found. In view of solutions obtained by Rayleigh
(1883) and others, and which have been reviewed by Lamb (1932, §§ 242-5), this result
calls for some enquiry. :

Lamb (loc. cit.) remarks that in the absence of dissipative forces the problem is to some
extent indefinite, in that one can always superpose an endless train of stationary waves
having the wave-length appropriate to the stream-velocity; and that when the stream-depth
his finite there will be indeterminateness or not, according as the stream velocity c is less or
greater than /(gh). Rayleigh, treating a stream of infinite depth, avoided the indeterminate-
ness by postulating dissipative forces of a somewhat arbitrary kind. Lamb (§ 245) discards
the frictional terms in his analysis, but ultimately adjusts his solution (by introducing a
uniform train of waves) so as to make the surface deformation insensible far upstream of
the disturbance. His treatment is restricted by his assumption that the elevation of the free surface
