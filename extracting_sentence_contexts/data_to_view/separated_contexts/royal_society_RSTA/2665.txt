In 1D, there also exist type-II events where the epicentre is located in the interior of
the rupture zone of that event with its rupture zone possessing a considerable overlap with that
of the past event. In the present 2D model, by contrast, we find that such type-II events rarely
occur, less than 1% in number. In fact, this has been anticipated in [40] from the geometry of the
2D model and from the stabilization mechanism of the type-II events observed in the 1D model. Our present calculation of the 2D model has confirmed the conjecture of [40]. Next, we investigate the event-size distribution.
