Small #. acutus are very seldom brought up by the trawl, and we have never been
successful in obtaining any at Plymouth smaller than 2 cm. across the test. If,
however, we are to judge from the rate of growth of LZ. esculentus ? x E. acutus f
hybrids, then these young #. acutus cannot be more than eight or nine months old.
It is natural to suppose that on the beds where the full-grown adult H. acutus are
found in such great numbers, it would be equally easy to obtain numbers of young
E, acutus, but all the young urchins brought up by the dredge or trawl are invariably
E. esculentus. It is possible that in the young stage, when the test is not more than
5 mm. in diameter, there may be no distinction between the young FZ. esculentus and
E. acutus. This is doubtful, on account of the difference between these two forms at
an age when they are not so very much bigger, which would seem to point to there
being a constant difference in pigmentation and size of the spines from the first. It
remains a fact, however, that the young /. acutus are remarkably difficult to obtain
from the beds where the adults are found in such great numbers. It is not infrequent
for 100 adult specimens of this form to be brought up by a single haul of the trawl,
and out of this number perhaps not more than six or seven will be under size.
