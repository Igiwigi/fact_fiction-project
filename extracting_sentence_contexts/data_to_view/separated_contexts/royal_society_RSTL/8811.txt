We are here brought face to face with a question of extreme importance, which it
will be useful to clear up. © Potential germs” and © hypothetical germs” have been
spoken of with scorn, because the evidence of the microscope as to their existence was
not forthcoming. Sagacious writers had drawn from their experiments the perfectly
legitimate inference that in many cases the germs exist, though the microscope fails to
reveal them. Such inferences, however, have been treated as the pure work of the
imagination, resting, it was alleged, on no real basis of fact. But in the concentrated
beam we possess what is virtually a new instrument, exceeding the microscope indefi-
