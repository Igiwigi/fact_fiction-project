We have defined the basic elements of a static game of

incomplete information, which we now alter to introduce Figure 2 also shows the change in reputation that each
the role of social prominence/capital via two different type of individual gains after signalling. We define this
mechanisms. For each, we will then solve for the signalling change in reputation as Ag; = qj â€” qi-1, the difference in
probability for high and low quality individuals (ie. the reputation after the public signalling event compared to
Bayesian Nash equilibrium strategy profiles), as a function before the event (reputation before the event is assumed to
of their social prominence/ capital. be 0.5 for all individuals).

In the hybrid equilibrium, S; does not affect change in
reputation. Although S; directly increases reputational gain,

(a) Mechanism 1: altered prior this effect is offset by the fact that P*(rlq=0, S;) increases
Our first intervention is to allow the prior 7; to depend on S;, with $;, which reduces the reputational gain. In the pooling
our term for either social prominence or social capital. S; is equilibrium in which everyone signals, signalling itself is
benchmarked against the individuals with the highest and not informative. Only the success/failure of the signal and
lowest prominence/capital, so that it ranges from 0 to 1, S; are informative. As S; increases, it becomes more and
with the highest value assigned to the individual with the more informative relative to the outcome, so that at high Sj,
