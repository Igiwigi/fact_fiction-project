at the cathode being distributed throughout the water in its neighbourhood and
giving rise to the vapour-colour.{ Analogy with the cases of gold and of silver
indicates that small spheres of sodium would produce in glass a colour not greatly
different from the vapour-colour produced by the molecularly subdivided metal.

Thus the colours developed in gold, silver, or soda glass by the radiation from the
emanation from radium are approximately the same as the colours which would be
given to the glass by the presence of the reduced metal, either molecularly divided or
in small spheres (nascent crystals).

It is therefore very probable that the metal in the glass is reduced by the action of
the radiation. This view finds considerable support in the discovery of Vintarp,**
that cathode rays exert a reducing action, as well as from the fact, already cited,+t
that Exsrer and Gerret found the salts of the alkali metals, which had been coloured
by exposure to cathode rays, to exhibit photo-electric effects as if they contained
traces of the free metal.
