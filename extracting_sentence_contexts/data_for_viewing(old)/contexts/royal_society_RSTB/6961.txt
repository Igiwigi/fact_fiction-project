still pinnately branched and bear little two-valved pollen capsules which appear to be just
like those of Williamsonia or Cycadeoidea and so is the pollen. The gynoecium is rather
peculiar in the apical projection of the axis (though this may be shown in Williamsonia
gigas and Cycadeoidea colossalis), and the seeds differ from those of Cycadeoidea and Wil-
liamsonia in being sessile, though again they are nearly sessile in W. scotica. It is suggested
that the long seed stalks of Cycadeoidea are an adaptation allowing a large number of
ovules to grow into fairly wide seeds in their peculiar position just within a spherical
surface.

It is impossible to extract the full value from comparing the seed of Williamsoniella
because of uncertainty about fact. Wielandiella is known to have possessed an elongated
seed which yields cuticles of extremely similar appearance (Harris 1932, p. 86). From the
fact that the integument below the micropyle is lined with cuticle and the nucellus is
also cutinized, it follows that the nucellus is ‘free’. It appears to be free in Williamsonia
scotica and may well be so in other Bennettitales, but it is difficult to compare the present
seed compressions with petrifactions.

The present account has removed what seemed two outstanding peculiarities of William-
soniella which were the absence of perianth and the simple microsporophyll with pad-like
pollen capsules. It is now shown to possess a perianth of hairy bracts exactly like those of
Cycadeoidea, and the microsporophylls, though simpler than those of any other species,
are only slightly reduced from the pinnate type seen in Cycadeoida colossalis Wieland. The
more complex relation suggested recently (Harris 1942, p. 589) to explain the pad-like
form of the capsules in Williamsoniella is ruled out now that their two-valved structure has
been realized.
