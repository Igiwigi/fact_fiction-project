This
unfortunately places it on top of the levels 3d°4p with which it should make strong
combinations. The corresponding 'D *P 'G 1S should be sufficiently higher to give
lines in the visible. This is the case ; and, in fact, one of these levels was found and
the remainder could have been found from spark and arc observations, because the
combinations d°4p — d*s? are all sharp lines. The discovery of d%s??F was only
possible after the d°5p levels had been found, with which it combines with moderate
intensity.
