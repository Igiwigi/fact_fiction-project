The most widespread devices of this kind are inertial vibration
exciters, which consist of unbalanced rotors driven into rotation by electric motors. Typically,
the design implies that the rotors rotate uniformly with a certain frequency of w and the body
performs forced small harmonic oscillations with the same frequency. In this work, we draw the readerâ€™s attention to the fact that this is true only in the first
approximation. In fact, the rotor rotation rate changes periodically, which leads to the emergence
of higher harmonics in the driving force and in the device oscillations. We obtain these oscillations
in the second approximation when solving the system of nonlinear equations of the joint motion
of the exciter rotor and the oscillating body.
