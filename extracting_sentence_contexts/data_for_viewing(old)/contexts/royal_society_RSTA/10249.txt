212 . SIR G. H. DARWIN ON THE

Thus
(2) = Pipe a ic ke We at

\7,

This is the form obtained in the solution of the restricted problem of ยง 3.

We conclude that if f(a/7), as expressed in (44), with values derived from any
solution of the problem of the equilibrium of two ellipsoids unconnected by a pipe,
is positive, the two figures are too far apart to admit of junction, and vice versd. I
have in fact always found it positive, although always diminishing as 7 diminishes, so
that junction would seem to be always impossible, at least so long as the approxima-
tion retains any validity. This might indicate that there is no figure of equilibrium
shaped like an hour-glass with a thin neck. However, I return to this subject in
discussing numerical solutions, and in the summary of results.

In the case where the two masses are equal, \=1, and the above formula for f(a/r)
fails by becoming indeterminate. As this is a case of especial interest, it must be

considered.

Since the two shapes are now exactly alike, we may take x, y, 8, k to define either
of them.
