stimulus was applied to the cortex, excitation of the proper focus immediately
resulted in active movements of the cords, which continued as long as the excitation
lasted. 8. Spencer’s Area of Arrest of Respiration——As in the dog, so in the cat,
excitation of this area on the olfactory lobe, between the olfactory tract and rhinal
fissure in front, and with the groove for the sylvian artery bounding it posteriorly,
resulted in arrest of the movements of the vocal cords ; but, instead of being arrested
in the expiratory position, as in the case of the dog, the cords were arrested in
abduction, 7.e., the position which they occupy in the inspiratory stage of respiration
(see fig. 13), a fact in keeping with Spencer’s results, for he found that excitation of
this area in the cat resulted in arrest of respiration in inspiration as a rule. What has been said with regard to slowing of the movements of the cords in the
dog holds good for the cat also, and need not be repeated here. VIL.
