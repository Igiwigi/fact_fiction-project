1. Introduction

A plethora of studies using a large variety of methodological approaches in
animal models and humans have clearly demonstrated that memory is not a
unitary process. On the one hand, declarative memory is defined as our
Julien Doyon capacity to acquire and recollect facts and events. It is known to depend primar-
e-mail: julien.doyon@mcgill.ca ily upon integrity of the medial temporal lobe, and the hippocampus in
particular (see [1,2], for reviews). On the other hand, procedural memory is
described as our ability to acquire a variety of skills, including simple and com-
plex motor skill behaviours such as shoe lacing or playing a musical
instrument, respectively.
