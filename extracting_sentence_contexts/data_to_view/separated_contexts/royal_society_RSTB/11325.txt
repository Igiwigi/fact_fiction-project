For example, Impulsivity was long noted to be a part of
Extraversion [106,107] but it is often associated with Negative,
and not Positive Affect. As another example, the Sensation
Seeking trait initially was a facet of the factor of Extraversion
(unified with the Positive Affect dimension) whereas high Sen-
sation Seeking is associated with complaints of boredom and a
need for fast ‘mood-fixers’ (i.e. with Negative Affect). In fact,
studies using subjects with low endorphins showed that they
had high Sensation Seeking and dysphoria but low Neuroti-
cism [158,159], and therefore Sensation Seeking cannot be
classified as being a facet of either Positive Affect or Neuroti-
cism (as a part of Negative Affect). As a third example, high
sociability is also a trait of Extraversion and Positive Affect
whereas in reality there is the phenomenon of ‘misery likes
company’ (i.e. negative affectivity motivating people to
pursue socialization and social approval). The dimensions of
Positive/Negative Affects, therefore, appears to be too
general and not be very useful for psychological and
psychopathological taxonomies.

(d) Dysregulation in receptor density: from

temperament traits to mental illness
In applying the FC perspective, we suggest that, whether in a
positive, negative, or emotionally neutral state in processing
current events, the psyche tries to answer the question
‘what should I do with it?’, and not ‘how does this makes
me feel?’ The main priority of the nervous system is to
assist in the construction of behaviour, and features of
biologically-based traits were developed in evolution
around this main priority.
