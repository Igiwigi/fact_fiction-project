verschiedenen Voraussetzungen (und Hilfsmittel) bei den Beweisen benutzt werden: Wenn
man 2 Wege hat, so muss man nicht bloss diese Wege gehen oder neue suchen, sondern
dann das ganze zwischen den beiden Wegen liegende Gebiet erforschen. (Quite generally,
if there are two proofs for a theorem, then one must keep going until one has derived
each of them from the other one, or until one has determined with precision, which sets
of assumptions (and aids) have been used in the two proofs. Given two routes, it is not
enough to take either of these two or to look for new ones, one ought to rather investigate
the entire area lying between the two routes.)

For, as we have seen from the examples presented, there is no way to ‘derive each of them
from the other one’. We could find the different sets of ‘assumptions’ that have been used in the
various proofs, yet it is not clear at all what the ‘area lying between the two’ should be, nor what
its investigation should look like. The moral of this section is precisely the fact that the various sets
of ‘assumptions’ are expressed in different language, and express incomparable states of being.
Or put differently, the worlds they conjure do not have mutually recognizable features.

3. Number of uses of an axiom

(a) Pythagoras’ theorem

The most striking effect of the ‘enwrapped and sealed’ 24th problem comes from the part which
states that

Da jeder Process des Addierens Anwendung des commutativen Gesetzes der Addition ist—
dies immer geometrischen Satzen oder logischen Schliissen entspricht, so kann man diese
