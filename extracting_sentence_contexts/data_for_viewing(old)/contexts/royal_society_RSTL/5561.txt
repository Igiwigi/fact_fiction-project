and rationalising

resulting point is not a double point, the other factors give each of them double points ;
and if we write

a=a(a+iv/1=e),
—2ai(a+i VI=)
(32—i vI=af)t *

we find

values which, in fact, belong to one of the four double points. It is easy to see that the
points in question are always imaginary.
It may be noticed, by way of a that the preceding values of x, y give

(4—1) (+5) = 2a7—f=75 Pa( 44 —4ain/l=o)

mo =p (—1+14e—16a+20(3—8)"/T=@);

and if the quantities within ( ; on the right-hand side are represented by A, B, C, then

R=—(a+iV/T —O@)
