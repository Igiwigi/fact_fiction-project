C. Spinal cord nerve centres. D. Channels of communication. A. Owing to the fact that the spinal ganglion has been made the object of some
important experimental observations we think it better to state these first, although
they are not, in our opinion, to be placed on the same ground as the phenomena
relating to the spinal nerve centres. This latter position is justified on consideration of the anatomical structure of a
spinal ganglion previously given, which shows that it is traversed by “ through”
protoplasmic channels,

(a.) Transmission of the Excitatory Electrical Change. Dv Bots-Reymonp observed” that when excitation was applied on the proximal side
of a spinal ganglion the “ negative variation” was observable in the nerve trunk on
the distal side.
