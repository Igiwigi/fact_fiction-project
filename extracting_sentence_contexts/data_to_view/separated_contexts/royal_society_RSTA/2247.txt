A further generalization of the analysis presented here would be to consider model architectures
other than the canonical and partitioned ones. For example, rather than allowing direct influence
of context on each observable, C € Pa(Fj), or signalling between observers, Cx € Pa(Fy), one could
consider models with direct influence between observables, Fq € Pa(F,’), to see what additional
insight they might provide into the mathematical nature of contextuality. As a fourth advantage, the model-based approach is naturally suited to the fact that
contextuality analysis of an empirical measurement system is analysis of a finite dataset. As
with any situation of hypothesis testing based on sample data, it requires statistical inference,
in this case inference of whether the data could have been generated by a model from some
class. As noted in §2, the data form a set M= (Mi! qe Q,cEC,q<c,1<i<ne}, with each
M“ a sample from an unknown distribution j1;.
