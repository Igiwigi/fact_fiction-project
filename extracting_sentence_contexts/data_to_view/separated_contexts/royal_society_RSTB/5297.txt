This joining up of separate amceba within the host cell, however, does not always occur. In time these may become enveloped in each other by mutual growth, but in such
instances no fusion of the protoplasts occur; each retains its individuality. This
fact may be clearly seen by the nuclei of the two organisms dividing separately, and
not simultaneously, as is characteristic of all the nuclei of a single plasmodium. The size of the mature plasmodium depends partly upon the quantity of available
food, and partly upon the size of the infected host cell. Large plasmodia, having lost
their power of movement, are unable to pass from cell to cell of the host.
