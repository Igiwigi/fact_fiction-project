Thus seen in
foreshortened perspective, the eye would in an instant have seized an abrupt motion
or discontinuity of the line, but © the appearance of the curye they formed was beau-
tiful ; the whole line of pins was deviated from the usual line QQ1 by an angle equal
to 12:45 inches, seen at a distance of ninety feet, or about 40', and besides this, the
pins lay in a beautiful and nearly continuous curve, presenting its convexity towards
the valley, and decidedly without any great step or start. This was beautifully seen
when I directed the vertical wire of the theodolite upon the forty-fifth pin and caused
it to describe a vertical plane*#. I observed however a curious fact, plainly indicated
by the numerical results ; the curve crossed the axis at the fourth pin, and attains its
greatest convexity at the twenty-fifthþ.”

Fourthly. That no information might be wanting as to the precise condition of the
mass of ice under experiment, I made a very minute examination of the state of the
transverse line with respect to the occurrence of flaws in the ice. The most import-
ant of these was one which returned into itself, crossing the line towards the origin
of the glacier between the twenty-sixth and twenty-seventh marks, and returning
backwards between the fortieth and forty-first without extending further upwards.
