It’s got to be made incredibly clear to all the citizens in that community that they can’t drink
water from all the taps. There is quite a big paradigm shift for everyone to come on board
with something like that. (CD4)

This was mirrored in the general fear expressed by the interviewed practitioners that the public
were not ‘educated’ enough to safely maintain or interact with stormwater, with interviewee
(CD2) arguing:

I think people need to increase their understanding of the complexity of stormwater. (CD2)

Ina public meeting hosted by the Stonefields Residents Association, residents expressed that
‘they are fully aware of what non-potable water is and what the risks are associated with it’ [28].
The fact that Stonefields residents agreed to pay extra for this scheme provides evidence that
people are willing to take on the responsibility for the third pipe and are open to the change
it entails.

The institutional or ‘expert’ mistrust of the public has been labelled the ‘dumb user’ narrative
[29]. Through research on Australian raintanks, it was found that water professionals used
similar narratives (including maintenance and health) to doubt the competence of the public in
a water management role. These narratives serve to support professional expertise and provide
reminders of the consequences of giving non-experts control. Developer CD3 acknowledged this
relationship, stating:

[The risk of polluted water] is there, but clearly it can be used to support your agenda if
that is what you want to do. (CD3)
