taken sequentially, and the context generated by the first measure influences subsequent ones. It
is an interesting twist of history that William James [4] introduced the concept of complementary
mental ideas to psychologists before Bohr [5] introduced the concept of complementary physical
measurements to quantum physicists.

According to quantum probability theory, events are represented as subspaces of a vector
space. Each subspace is spanned by a subset of basis vectors. If A and B are two events
that are spanned by the same basis, then they are compatible, and the sequence of questions
does not matter. However, if A and B are two events that are spanned by different bases,
then they are incompatible and the sequence does matter. Each subspace of a vector space
corresponds to a projector. If two events are incompatible, then their projectors do not commute;
otherwise, they are compatible. Therefore, in short, quantum theory uses the non-commutativity
of projectors to account for sequential effects. Complementarity refers to the fact that some
questions are incompatible.

Measurement sequence effects are typically regarded as ‘nuisance effects’ or ‘methodological
artefacts’ by social and behavioural scientists [1]. However, from the quantum theoretical
perspective, they are evidence for the essential constructive nature of human cognition [2].
Many cognitive measurements, such as attitude judgements and probability judgements, are
incompatible measures, and are sensitive to the context created by previous questions. This
is one of the important advantages to model human decision and cognition using quantum
probability rules, and complementarity (or incompatibility) is an interesting and useful concept
to be reintroduced into psychology.

An important issue for application of quantum theory to cognition is the following: Which
