In my former experiments at Killiney Bay, it will be recollected that it was in my
power to determine this experimentally and rigidly, the moderate charges of powder
there employed admitting of this, and that T found it amount for 25 lbs. of powder to
07050513, or to about 2th of a second. Such is, in fact, the time that the full charge
of a 68-pounder takes to burn. But in the present case direct experiment was impossible ;
and the yalue for this correction can only be approximately obtained, by observing the
time that elapsed in some instances between the moment of making contact at B and
the first great visible movement of rock at the face of the heading. This obseryation I
