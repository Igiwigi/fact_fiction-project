1006 DR. W. H. GASKELL ON THE RHYTHM oF THE HEART OF

Another view, which largely depends for its support upon the action of various
Poisons, is, that the nerve does not produce standstill by direct interference with the
motor ganglia, bub because it excites 8ome inhibitory mechanism which is interpolated
between these ganglia and the muscular tissue. Both these views have one hypothesis
in common, viz.: that the inhibitory action of the nerve is due to the prevention of
the discharges from the motor ganglia from reaching the muscular tissne, and not to
the action of the nerve upon the musele itself, In pharmacological literature especially
this hypothesis has become 80 predominant that again and again the statement is
made that 8uch and such a poison paralyses or stimulates some part or other of the
vagus nerve, when the facts only show in the first case that the vagus is no longer able
to produce standstill, and in the second that the poison has by its action caused the
heart to beat slower.

Again, a number of observers, notably Sonree,* have asserted that sbimulation of
the vagus nerve of the Frog under certain cireumstances always causes acceleration
of the heart's rhythm, and nob slowing : a result which, conjoined with the action of
atropia, has led to the supposition that the Frog's vagus contains accelerator as well
as inhibitory fibres, and a fresh set of hypotheses has been made with respect to the
relative vitality of these two sets of fibres.

Finally, it has been long known that the contractions which immediately follow the
standstill caused by vagus stimulation are much weaker than the normal contractions,
