The numbers represent the
percentage change in use of the different inputs following a percentage change in the price of materials. A positive co-efficient
indicates an increase in the use of, for example, labour in response to an increase in the price of materials.

between primary and fabricated metal is particularly stark with energy being a close substitute
for materials in primary metal but not in fabricated metal. Third, capital is not a strong substitute
for materials; in fact, in several sectors, the two inputs are complements. Taken together, these
estimates show the opportunities and pitfalls of trying to achieve carbon reduction through
changing material prices. In construction, for example, a higher price of materials leads to less
materials being used, and to less capital, with output being maintained through greater use of
labour, but also with the negative consequence of greater energy being used directly.
