a medusoid type may be here also witnessed, but further observations are necessary for the complete elucidation
of this point.

some” of the' free medusoids of a Syreoryne tobe filled with" ova, sappoted® these
medusoids to possess the” same signification as that” which" Enrexpere hat atthc
buted to the fixed eapsules. ' 'SpEENSTRUP, adopting with some'slight modification
the same view, has found in'it one'of the most'striking of the facts which he has 86
skilfully collated in his essay* on” The Alternations of Generations” while'Vax
Bexepex®, in two elaborate memoirs full of beautiful and accurate obsetvations, ts
s*trenuously opposed it, maintaining that "the ovigerous fixed capsnles are merely
organs, © ovisacs,” while the free medusoids are larve 'destined to nndergo i Series
of transformations during a process of development 'into"the form 'of the parent
zoophyte. M. Vax Bexegpex, however, though he has had the mequsoids' Tong wnder
his eyes, has never witnessed an actnal development into the” form of the parent
polype, and'the changes which he has figured as occurring in them'do not appearto
show any tendency to such a transformation. I have had the medusoids of 'a Syn-
coryne for more than a fortnight under constant inspection without perceiving the
slizhtest change towards the form of the adalt polype ; at the end of this period they
perished.
