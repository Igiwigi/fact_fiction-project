8eries of electromotive elements.

This proposition furnishes a clear explanation of several important facts of muscular
electricity. The first of these facts is, that a differential current takes place constantly on
closing the circuit with the gastrocnemius of a frog united with its half-thigh, the current
being determined by the gastrocnemins. The experiment succeeds equally, if, instead of
leaving the tendon attached to the gastrocnemius, the latter is cut transyersely: in all cases
it is essential that one of the muscles be longer than the other, so that either the gastro-
enemius or the half-thigh may predominate. The same result may be obtained by employ-
ing a prepared frog reduced to two half-thighs of unequal length attached to a piece of
the spine.

This same proposition leads us to explain the fact discovered by M. Du Bots REYMOND,
namely, that a current is obtained by touching with the plates of the galvanometer
the central points and the edge of the same transverse section of a large muscle. In
fact, the central points belong to the longest muscular fibres, and therefore play the same
part towards the points near the edge of this section belonging to the shortest fibres, as
the interior of a muscle towards its surface.

I take this opportunity of calling attention to a fundamental difference existing between
a muscular electromotor and a voltaic pile. Let us take an entire muscle, such as the
thigh of a frog, and cut it in half: it is known that the two sections thus formed have
