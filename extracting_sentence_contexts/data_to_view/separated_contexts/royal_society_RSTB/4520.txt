From each lobe there arises a
composite nerve consisting of the fibres of the labral nerve (l.n.) innervating the
labrum, and the frontal nerve which passes to the unpaired ganglion of the same
name. Arising from the tritocerebron are the para-wsophageal connectives which are
directed nearly vertically downwards. The infra-esophageal ganglion forms a pyriform mass and, beyond the fact that
paired nerves arise therefrom, it exhibits no outward indications of a paired structure. The para-cesophageal connectives enter close together in the mid-dorsal line, and not
far from the centre of the ganglia. The mandibular nerves are large and stout, and
arise in close association with one another from the anterior border of the ganglia.
