Further, it is found that in every
case the same velocity constant is obtained after a time. It follows from this that
the combining chlorine and carbon monoxide when exposed to light of a certain
intensity and composition, always acquire after a certain time the same constant
properties, the same chemical affinity to one another. The fact that the same
constant was found in all curves of the same system, and that the investigation was
carried on as far as 80°66 per cent. (in Tables I. and II.) and 39°16 per cent. (in
Table IIL.)
