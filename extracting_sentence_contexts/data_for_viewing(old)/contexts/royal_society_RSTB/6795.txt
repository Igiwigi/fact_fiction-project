It appears from Table II that the distribution of X” is not uniform, the virus being
absent or but feebly developed in the roots, the young stolon and its growing tuber. In
the leaflets springing from each node there is some evidence of variation in virus con-
tent which, however, is noticeably less at the second examination. It seems likely that
a more detailed examination might disclose definite areas in the plant which the virus
has failed to reach and whith would be susceptible to infection by other strains of the
X virus.

Doubtless a plant which has no inherent resistance to the virus will eventually be
infected in all or nearly all its parts; though not necessarily in the same concentration
throughout. Before the complete dissemination of the virus has taken place, however,
reinfection with another strain is obviously possible. Such, in fact, does occur and is
referred to on p. 163 (see X%).

It will be observed that whilst the concentration of X” is very low in the recently
formed stolons and tubers, it is abundantly present at the base of the stem from which
they are growing. Hence it may be said that the concentration of the virus is a function
of the relative age of the plant organs rather than of their spatial relationship.

THE MILD oR X© sTRAIN

The G strain originated from the green tissue selection of the culture represented as
No. 39 in the Experimental Group No. V* where it makes its first appearance in culture
