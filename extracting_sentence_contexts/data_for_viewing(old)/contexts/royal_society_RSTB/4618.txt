co-ordinated and very nearly allied.” Drsneux has shown that the Isoptera are
derived phylogenetically from the Blattide, and Houmeren (1909) maintains that
the Termitidee and Blattoidea are offshoots of the primitive group of the Proto-
blattoide, a view with which my own studies have led me to entirely concur.
Additional confirmation of the Orthopteran affinities of the Isoptera has been afforded
by WALKer’s discovery (1914, p. 93) of the remarkable synthetic type Grylloblatta
campodeiformis, which he relegates to the new family of the Grylloblattide. The
affinities of this insect have been further investigated by Crampron (1915, p. 337),
who regards it as an annectant link between the Dermaptera and the Isoptera, but
more closely related to the former than the latter. .

An examination of the primitive characters exhibited in the genera Archotermopsis
and Mastotermes reveals the fact that many are also Blattid features, and these two
genera throw a good deal of light upon the phylogeny of the Isoptera. My studies
lead me to the conclusion that the Isoptera are more closely related to the Blattidee
than to the Dermaptera, and are only remotely related to the Embiide. This view
is based not only upon certain features of their external morphology, but also upon
the internal anatomy.

Houmeren (1909, pp. 208-18, and 1911, pp. 15-31) has dealt tolerably fully with
the Blattid affinities of the Isoptera, laying special stress upon the wing characters of
Mastotermes, and other features of their external structure. The affinities revealed
by their internal anatomy have been less thoroughly examined, and Archotermopsis
exhibits the following Blattid characters in the digestive and reproductive organs.
