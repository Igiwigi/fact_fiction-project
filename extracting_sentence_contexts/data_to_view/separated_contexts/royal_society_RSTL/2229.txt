The electricity of the Torpedo, theoretically considered, offers a wide field for
speculation. Is it, it may be asked, merely a form or yariety of common electricity,
or a distinct kind, or not a single power, but a combination of many powers ? The first opinion, which is commonly received, and which has been ably advocated
recently by Mr. Farapary, is supported by the majority of the facts adduced in this
paper. The cireumstance principally hostile to it, at least in appearance, is the inter-
ruption of the torpedinal electricity by the smallest quantity of air, and its want of
the power of attraction and repulsion in the air. These peculiarities are seemingly in favour of the second opinion, that the electri-
city of the Torpedo is specific and peculiar.
