the origin (Whittaker 1949, chap. v1). For r++0, the concept of convergence hitherto con-
sidered has been that of uniform convergence in D(r). We shall later see instances in which
properties of H(R) correspond to properties of H(r) with the topology 7,, whereas H(r),

regarded as a space with the topology of uniform convergence in D(r), generally fails to
have that property. We shall see also that in cases where H(r) (with convergence in Di(r))
has been proved to have certain properties, the conditions assumed have implied that, in
the case in question, convergence in D(r) and in D,,(r) are equivalent. It is remarkable that this
idea of representation in closed circles should, in this subject, have received more attention
than the more natural concepts of representation in open circles and at the origin.

If we take, as base for H(1/r), the Taylor base {z"}, we see from § 3 that the biorthogonal
set is again the Taylor base {z"} in H(r). Theorem 2-1 states the well-known fact that every
f¢H(r) is represented absolutely by its Taylor series in some D,(r). From theorem 2-2
we obtain:

Turorem 4-1. Let {p,(z)} be any sequence of functions in H(r) such that every fe H(p) (for a

given p>r) is represented in some D,(r) by a series of the form + Cy b,(Z). Then there exists R>r such
pina =)

that every such f is so represented in D(R).
