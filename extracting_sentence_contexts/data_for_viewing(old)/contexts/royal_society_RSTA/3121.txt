Now take 7#=C=R@iR and consider the one-parameter groups of unitary operators
(W(ix))xer and (W(x))xeR. From (2.4)

W(ix)W(y) =e W(ix + y),
whereas
W(y)W(ix) =e" "YW(ix + y),
so that the Wey] relations (2.2) hold,
eV W(ix)W(y) =e W(y)W(ix),
and we obtain a new canonical pair (Pgock, JFock) by writing
W(ix) = e®P Fk and W(x) = el Fok,

In fact, the pair (pEock, YFock) is irreducible and the isomorphism U of the Stone-von Neumann
uniqueness theorem is thus from L2(R) itself to '(C). It can be constructed explicitly as follows.
First, apply the isomorphism from L (R) to the Hilbert space R(Z>0) determined by the
orthonormal basis of Hermite functions. Then compose this with the isomorphism from R (Zz0)
to ’(C) in which the successive tensor powers of C are all identified with C itself by multiplication
of complex numbers, and the preimage of each exponential vector is its physicists’ realization,

Can we construct a joint probability distribution for a canonical pair (p,q) acting in a quantum
