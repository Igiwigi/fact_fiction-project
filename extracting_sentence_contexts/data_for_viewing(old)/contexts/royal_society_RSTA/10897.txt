formule can be based and (ii) the number of measuremeuts used to form an estimate.
Thus in the third fundamental problem we do not get as good absolute results as we
might hope to do, because we have not really at present available the best data
possible. Again in the first fundamental problem we cannot expect to reconstruct
the capacity of the individual skull without a fairly large average error. For it is of
the very essence of the principle of variation, on which evolution itself depends, that
in any population we should have an array of skulls with the same length, breadth,
and height, and yet having within certain limits a variety of capacities, All we can
hope to say is, that with such a length, breadth and height such a capacity is most
frequent. When we come to averaging a series, then we shall determine with far
greater accuracy the mean of an array. Here the nature of the problem is, however,
modified. The question is now how far can we apply results deduced from one local
race toa second, We want in fact a “panracial” regression formula to replace our
intraracial regression formula, As it is impossible to find such a regression formula for
the primitive stock from which man may be supposed to be derived, we are compelled
to take the regression formulz which are least changed as we pass from race to race.
The mean formula thence derived appears to give excellent results, when applied to
determine the capacity of very diverse races, While I do not profess to have solved
the problems proposed to the degree of accuracy which might be obtained with wider
data and measurements made ad hoc in the anatomical school, I yet consider that
T have given practical solutions to the following problems :—

(i.) The reconstruction of the capacity of the individual skull, when this’ cannot be
measured directly. This is done with a mean error of 3 to 4 per cent.
