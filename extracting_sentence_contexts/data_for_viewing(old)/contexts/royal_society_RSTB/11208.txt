2. Tissue repair responses to apoptosis:
phagocytic and anti-inflammatory effects

Classically, apoptosis contrasts with non-programmed, necro-
tic cell death in failing to incite inflammatory responses and
providing tolerogenic signals to the adaptive immune system
[24] (although, under certain circumstances, apoptosis can be
immunogenic, and necrosis can also be programmedâ€”see
[25-27] for recent reviews). In fact, the best-known responses to
apoptotic cells are described as anti-inflammatory, character-
ized by the production of anti-inflammatory mediators, such
as TGF-B1, IL-10 and PGE, which are associated with suppres-
sion or resolution of inflammatory responses [24,28,29]. The
non-phlogistic nature of apoptosis is reflected in the absence
of inflammatory effects of the process during normal physi-
ology. For example, in the thymus, an organ in which the
vast majority of the cells it produces undergo apoptosis,
the process is histologically virtually invisible. This illustrates
the rapidity with which apoptotic cells are removed from
histological sight and this occurs as a consequence of phago-
cytosis that is dependent on Rac-1 signalling [13,30]. The
