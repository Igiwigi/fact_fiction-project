174. I have already referred, in my General Introduction, to the elaborate inquiry of
Professor WILLIAMSON into the organization of Polystomella crispayh, as having not only
established several important facts in regard to its minute structure, but as having fur-
nished the starting-point for all future investigations of the same kind : it now becomes
necessary that I should somewhat fully recapitulate the most important features of his
description, in order that it may be seen in what points my own inquiries upon a more
developed form of the same group have evolved results supplementary to his. To the
accuracy of his descriptions I can bear the fullest testimony ; having not only had the
opportunity, through the kindness of Professor WILLIAMSON, of examining the prepara-
tions still in his possession both of the shell and of the animal of Polystomella crispa,
but having carried out an independent investigation upon specimens collected by
myself.

175. On the exterior of each of the segmental divisions of the shell of P. erispa, strong
transverse crenulations present themselves, which are deepest near the convex margin of
the preceding septal band, where they terminate somewhat abruptly, and usually dis-
appear before reaching the concave margin of the subsequently-formed chamber.
