Since | B,(x) | <q?(x), the
eee follows from Bourbaki (1949, chap. x, §3, prop. 4) by taking ‘E” to be F, with
t8pology JZ, and ‘F’ to be F, with its topology 7; the set of linear combinations of the

} is, of course, everywhere dense. In the foregoing argument there is a slight complication owing to the fact that {z,} is
t necessarily a base for F, (with its usual topology Z). It is this fact that prevents a
mplete reduction from F,-spaces and topologies to Aspaces and topologies (cf. § 2). From the proof, however, we can state:

Corollary. Let E be an F-space with a base {z,} and 7 an F-topology on E, coarser than the
topology 7, of E.
