Pressures are only set up when one member grows faster than another ;
and such pressures require to be fully established before any theory can be based on
them. In the case of Welwitschia, the pressure is set up not so much by the cone-
scales against the flowers, as by the flowers growing at the expense of the cone-scales. The nucellus retains its circular section very fairly; the scales are forced apart and
squeezed, and the effect of the ovule pressure is most obviously seen in the fact that
if all the ovules press equally they would make accurate ridge-lines on the cone. But, by slipping over each other slightly, they make mutual adjustments, as seen
in longitudinal section along the orthostichy lines, which cuts the superposed
ovules differently. Hence the sectional elevation (fig. 2) is slightly diagramatised,
and successive scales pushed slightly more open than they should be, so that the
fitting of the parts is not absolutely accurate as in nature.
