Each molecule of lubricant in a primary film exerts its influence independently of
the others. This follows from the fact that the friction varies directly with the density
of the vapour of the lubricant when the primary films on the surface are deposited
from vapour (IV, 556). The properties of primary films are easily studied by the use of a spherical slider,
and the fact that the friction is the same when such a slider stands in a large pool of
lubricant as it is when the faces of slider and plate are covered only by an insensible
primary film deposited from saturated vapour proves that the molecular configuration
of such films is the same in both cases (see especially IV, 554, and VII, 28).


6 SIR WILLIAM HARDY ON PROBLEMS OF THE BOUNDARY STATE. A primary film is there, even when a solid lubricant has been deposited from solution
in a volatile solvent, and may be reached by moving a spherical slider about. When this
is done the friction rises as the slider cuts through until it reaches a value unchanged by
further movement and identical with the value for the same lubricant when fluid.*

In EX, 7, the fact that the coefficient of friction varies with the load and that a latent
period of rising friction and falling coefficient followed an increase in the load when the
surfaces were lubricated only by a primary film deposited from saturated vapour and
the slider was plane was taken to prove that a primary film is more than one molecule
in thickness and is capable of being squeezed out from between the faces.
