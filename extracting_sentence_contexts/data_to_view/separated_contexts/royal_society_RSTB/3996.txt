On returning from a high altitude to a low one
a reverse change in the blood is observed. The relation of the change to deficiency
of oxygen was clearly established by Jonyer and Setiier,{ for they found that they
could produce polycythemia by keeping animals in air at normal barometric pressure
but deficient in oxygen, while lowering of the barometric pressure proved ineffective
so long as the oxygen percentage was kept high. A possible effect in this connection
from the low temperature and low percentage of moisture in the atmosphere usually
met with at high altitudes was negatived by the work of ScHAUMANN and
{OSENQVISTS and of Jaquer.|| Thenceforward the bulk of the work has dealt with
the facts underlying the increase in the percentage values of the red corpuscles and
the hemoglobin. The question at issue has been whether the alteration is brought
about by the mere loss of fluid from the blood without any alteration in the total
number of corpuscles or total amount of hemoglobin in the body, or whether the
essential thing is an actual overproduction of corpuscles and hemoglobin. Wess?
was unable to detect any alteration in the amount of hemoglobin per kilo body weight
in animals kept at an altitude of 4000 feet, though he obtained the usual increase in
the number of red corpuscles per cubic millimetre.
