Angles of position.â€”In the discussion of the measures of position, it must be re-
membered that four of the stars observed, viz. 39 Bootis, 3 Serpentis, py Draconis,
and P XXII 306, exhibit differences in their mean positions, as compared with those
given by other observers, of an amount sufficient to induce the belief that they are
binary systems : the observations of these stars may therefore be at once dismissed
with the remark, that they are useless for the purposes of this inquiry. Again, in the
case of five other stars, viz. y Arietis, @? Cancri, 178 (Bode) Libre, 100 Herculis and
579 Struve, the components are of equal magnitude, and parallax is in this case not
only & priori highly improbable, but there is nothing in the actual observations them-
selves of these stars, which can lead us to any definite conclusion as to its existence
in fact. It is proper, however, to direct attention to the large differences in the case
of 9? Cancri, accordant in respect of sign.
