Figure 4. Local spin density approximation majority and minority spin energy bands for fictitious FeH. The bands are coloured : >
according to their angular momentum (orbital) character: red shows s electrons, blue shows d electrons and green shows 1S
pelectrons [37]. [=

As such, you have much greater freedom over where you can put it :B
over anything that has core electrons associated with it. Although it Ss
does attract an electron, at the end of the day you are embedding a [8
proton in an electron gas, and you can stick that almost anywhere and it
can be embedded almost anywhere. Meanwhile, for an atom with core
electrons, you can’t just put it anywhere because Pauli repulsion of core
electrons stops you from putting it almost anywhere. The hydrogen then
has much greater flexibility with where it can end up.
