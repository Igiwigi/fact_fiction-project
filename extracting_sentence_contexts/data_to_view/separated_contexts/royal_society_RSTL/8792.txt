This proportion of the sulphur is evidently at
= once fixed, at the instant of explosion, by union with parts of the metal surfaces
EY presented by the interior of the yessel in which the operation is conducted. The
= extent to which sulphur is thus abstracted from the powder-constituents, and precluded
Z from entering into the reactions which are established by the explosion, or follow
£5 immediately upon it, must depend in some degree upon accidental circumstances, such
6 as variations in the mechanical condition (smoothness, brightness, &c.) of the metal
S gurfaces, and als» upon the temperature developed at the instant of the explosion. S The circumstance that, in the statement of the results of Experiment 42, both potas-
= sum_ oxide and sulphur are separately included is therefore explained by the above

fact. The larger proportion of the © sulphur ” specified in the several analyses existed
as potassium polysulphide, and may therefore be styled free sulphur, as it did not take
_ part in the chief reactions. The carbonate, like the suIphate, differed decidedly in amount in the residues
furnished by the R.
