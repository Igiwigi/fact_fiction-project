Like in the previous chapter, the corresponding derivation is based on a Maxwell
equation. Here, a new thermodynamic state function @ is used as introduced by Wagner [32]

@ =F — puny, (5.2)


where F is the Helmholtz free energy, nj and jy are the number of moles hydrogen and the
corresponding chemical potential. For the sake of simplicity, hydrogen is used as the solute,
despite the fact that equation (5.2) and the following are also valid for other solutes. The
differential of the state function is

d& =dW — SdT + wydnm — nuda, (5.3)

where dW is a work term like the stress/strain-term in equation (4.1) or in the present context, it
is the differential work to create a discontinuity

dW = yVdp. (5.4)

The formation energy of the discontinuity is y (for instance, the surface energy) and the
volumetric density of discontinuities is expressed by p. Then Vdp corresponds to a differential :
change of the surface area, dislocation length or number of vacancies, etc.
