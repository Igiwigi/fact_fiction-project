PROF. C. G. BARKLA ON X-RAYS AND THE THEORY OF RADIATION. 317

Difficult as the first two results would be to explain on any entity or quantum
theory—that is, any theory assuming radiation itself to exist in definite indivisible
bundles or quanta—perhaps the strongest evidence against this is provided by the
third fact stated above. The distribution calculated and given by the expression
I, = I,» (1+cos’@) where I, is the intensity of radiation scattered in a direction
making an angle @ with that of propagation of the primary beam depends essentially
on a steady variation with direction, not of a number of indivisible entities, but of the
energy density around a single radiating charge—an electron in this éase. 4.
