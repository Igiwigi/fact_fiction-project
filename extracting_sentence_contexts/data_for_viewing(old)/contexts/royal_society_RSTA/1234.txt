(a) the semigroups generated by A, satisfy the stability condition,

(b) for some, and hence all 4 > w, the range of A — A is dense in X (this gives convergence of
resolvents), and eal

(c) D(A) is dense in X (this gives density of the range of the limit pseudo-resolvent), ae

then the semigroups converge and the limit semigroup is generated by A. :B
This version of the convergence theorem has a clear advantage over the original one. It does :8
not require knowing the resolvents (A — An)‘ ina manageable form, and the latter is often not 1
available (think, for example, of Ays as being proven to be generators by an intricate perturbation
argument). This advantage cannot be overestimated (for a wide spectrum of applications, see e.g.
[4,10,15]). In fact, in the light of this version, the approach via resolvents turns out to be not so
natural, and indeed much less useful than we have become accustomed to think. In particular, the
approach via resolvents hides a number of curious phenomena visible only when looked upon
from the perspective of the extended limit. For instance, see [10] Section 3.4, even though all the
operators A, of (2.5) are defined on the common domain D(D), the domain of their extended limit,
i.e. the domain of the generator of the minimal semigroup of Kato’s Theorem, may be larger than
D(D) or even larger than the domain of the closure of D + O.
The following example, which we owe to Jochen Gltick, exhibits a similar effect, and may be
appreciated by the readers who find the notion of extended limit counterintuitive or unnatural.
Let (ej); be an orthonormal basis in a Hilbert space H, so that any x € H may be represented as
x= re, &e; where & = (x, e;),i > 1. For each n > 1, the formula
