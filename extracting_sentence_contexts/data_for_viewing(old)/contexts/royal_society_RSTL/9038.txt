(7) This sensitiveness is different at different parts of the same piece of selenium.

(8) In most of the pieces which we have tested, the action of light, when there is no
battery-current passing, causes a flow of electricity from the selenium to the platinum
at the illuminated junction. 'To distinguish these currents from currents arising from
any other cause, we have called them photoelectric currents.

The place of Selenium in the Thermoelectric Scale.

In the above paper it has been assumed as a fact established by the researches of the
late Dr. Marrnms88n (Proc. R. S. vol. ix. p. 99, 1857, and Phil. Trans. 1858) that
platinum stands above selenium in the thermoelectric scale, and therefore that the
direction of a thermoelectric current would be from platinum to selenium at the heated
joint. Tt has been suggested that, considering the changes produced in selenium by the
process of annealing, it would be well to try the thermoelectric properties of the several
Pieces used in the above experiments.

As many of these pieces are only 3 or 4 millims. in length, and as the ends of the
