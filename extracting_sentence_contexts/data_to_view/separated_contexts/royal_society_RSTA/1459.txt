For, dividing by h and making h +0 (keeping ph constant) we see that the coefficients
of h are equal, as all the other terms +0. So for the coefficients of 2, h', h‘, and finally
the odds andends. (‘The fact that the e’s are evaluated at p+ 1h, and not at ph, presents
no difficulty, since the e’s +0 uniformly.)
