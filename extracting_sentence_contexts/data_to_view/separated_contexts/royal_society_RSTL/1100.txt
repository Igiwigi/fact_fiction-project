For higher dispersive
ratios, if laid close together, they would touch in the vertex. This is regarded as an objection in practice, and justly, (espe-
cially when the curvatures of the surfaces in contact differ
considerably) as their pressure on each other at the centre
must tend to distort their figures, and disturb the uniformity
of their density, not to speak of the production of the colours
of thin plates, whose effect on vision is more problematic. But in fact, the difference of the curvatures in this construc-
tion is 80 very trifling, as to fall within the limits of practical
errors, and therefore, if the separation of. the two glasses by
a ring of metal (which in a 10 feet object-glass, of 5 inches
aperture, even in the very unfavourable case of z=0:70 need
not exceed 1-400th of an inch'in thickness) be deemed un-
advisable, it may be neglected, and the glasses ground to
the same radius, provided only the necessary alterations are
made in the other surfaces to preserve the proper proportion
of their focal lengths.

26. With regard to the interpolation of the tables above
given for intermediate values of 7; if we cast our eyes down
the second and th columns, we cannot but be struck by the

extent of the table, i. e. as far as z=0:70, (beyond which it
is very unlikely it should ever extend in practice). In fact,
these values have, the one a maximum and the other a mini-
mum between @=0'55 and x=0'60.
