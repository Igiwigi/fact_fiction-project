These new activities are neither financially attractive enough nor a sufficiently good fit with
their core competences for major oil companies to pursue in place of the next big upstream
project. Current conventional fuel retail is not a high-margin business: only non-fuel products,
such as snacks and drinks, make a good return at retail stations. Large integrated oil companies
make their money at the wellhead because the price of conventional crude oil significantly
exceeds the finding, development and operating costs and the company retains part of this value,
despite the fact that most of it accrues to the relevant government. In the last decade, spiralling
capital costs have inflated big oilâ€™s collective balance sheet leaving little scope to dilute returns
on capital employed by making significant investments on unproven technologies in nascent
fuel retail segments with only marginal net present value. Figure 10 shows that annual global
upstream investment has risen sixfold since 1999, broadly in line with crude prices.
