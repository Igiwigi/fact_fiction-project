D,,—112°15 should
give D,, = 4261°53. This has not been observed, but it is D,,(1)(—13d). In fact,
the error between this calculated value and that deduced from D,, is only
d\ = 02, and a satellite difference of 183 is more in accordance with that of
other elements than the small one of 143, in the accepted series. Amongst the other
lines are the collaterals 4280°4 (intensity 9) = (A) (4260) with O-—C = —-04, and
4363°7 (intensity 2) = (5A) (4260) with 0—C = ‘1.
