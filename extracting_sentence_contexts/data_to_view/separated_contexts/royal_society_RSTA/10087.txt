Now if we are to accept these results as final, we shall have to believe that
throughout the third region the level surface is always inclined by 6-4 to the
spheroidal surface. We know of no cause tending to produce such an extraordinary
deformation, and we are led to suspect the reasoning by which its existence has been
inferred. The only certain fact that has been brought to light by observation is that
the plumb-lines in the trigon have a northerly deflection greater by 6’°4 than the
plumb-line at Kalitnpur. We have, however, taken a step in advance of this safe
ground, and have assumed that the direction of gravity at Kaliénpur is vertical, and
that consequently the plumb-line throughout peninsular India is deflected 6”*4 towards
the north. Would it not be more reasonable to assume that the mean direction of
gravity throughout the third region is vertical. and that the plumb-line at Kaliénpur
is deflected 6’°4 towards the south?
