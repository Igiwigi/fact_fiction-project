been confirmed by those of Mazevpig, that the one set are nerves of sensation,
the other of motion ; a circumstance which explains many of the phenomena
of disease, which have suggested the probability of these functions being

exercised by different nerves bound up in the same envelope. Dr. Parry in
his treatise -on the pulse for example, relates a case where feeling alone was
lost in one arm, and voluntary power alone in the other. But these are not
the only nor indeed the most important functions of the spinal nerves. All of
them contribute to the formation of the ganglionic system, on which the life
of the animal, as will appear from many facts I am about to state, immediately
depends.

It is evident from what has been said, that the ganglions and plexuses re-
semble each other in their nature ; and as the neryes which terminate in them
come from all the most distant parts of the nervous system, some from the
brain, and some from the lower extremity, and all intermediate parts of the
Spinal marrow, we cannot help supposing, that there is some design in thus
uniting nerves which arise from 80 many different parts of these organs. One
of the most striking differences between the ganglionic nervyes, and those pro-
ceeding directly from the brain and spinal marrow, is that even independently
of the ganglions and plexuses, the former every where more freely anastomose,
if I may borrow a term from the sanguiferons system ; while the latter proceed
