However, it is certain that in all
of these forms, the muscle-fibres of the second metotic somite have lost their individual
existence by the 30-somite stage, and this accounts for the frequent assertions in the
literature to the effect that only four myotomes arise in the head in birds. Cutarvat (1890) described the development of only three occipital ventral nerve-
roots in the chick, but Jager (1924) has described four, which agrees with the conditions
in the duck reported here. A feature of some interest is the fact (reported later, p. 433)
that as many as five hypoglossal foramina can be seen in the basal plate of the skull
of the duck. These obviously correspond to the 2nd to 6th metotic segments, and it
is interesting to find that a foramen in the cartilage may persist (in this case, that
of the 2nd metotic segment) although the nerve-root which originally penetrated
through it may no longer be discernible.

(iii) Conclusion—We may, then, conclude by stating that the posterior limit of the
skull of the duck is formed by an included vertebra, the anterior portion of which
arises from the posterior sclerotomite of the 6th metotic segment, and the posterior
portion of which therefore arises from the anterior sclerotomite of the 7th metotic
segment. The joint between the skull and the first or atlas vertebra is intervertebral,
and therefore intra-segmental, viz., in the middle of the 7th metotic segment.
