PPE on a foot, by 212% Now, as the manometers re-
-ſemble ſolid rods much more than they do barometer
”tubes, it is probable their dilatation, even allowing for the
\ greater extenſion of the bulb, would not exceed ths of
Awinch on a: Foot, or th part on every two inches. In
[ this ratio I lidve therefore augmented the apparent, to
obtain the true, capacity of each manometer, The equa-
