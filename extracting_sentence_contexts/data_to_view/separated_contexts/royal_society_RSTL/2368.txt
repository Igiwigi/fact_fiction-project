Deprived of their vital
powers, they may still, as far as we see, be perfect in all their parts. On what their
vital powers depend, we know not. In the study of these powers, and the relation they

them. And what other knowledge havye we of the inanimate powers themselves? Do
we know more of the nature of gravitation or electricity than of life ?
