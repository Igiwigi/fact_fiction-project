This observation
is explained by the high concentration of hydrogen under cathodic charging. In such conditions,
where the material is effectively being saturated with hydrogen, any difference in initial residual
hydrogen concentration is comparatively negligible. It should be noted that the results for alloy A8-10B21 are limited by the fact that samples could
not be produced at hardness above 42 HRC. This hardness limit due to the lower carbon content
also means that A8-10B21 samples produced at 42 HRC (M29, M30) are in the near-as-quenched
condition. In other words, they have not undergone any significant degree of tempering.
