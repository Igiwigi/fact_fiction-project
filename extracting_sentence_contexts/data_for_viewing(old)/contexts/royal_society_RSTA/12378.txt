reduction for the rays near E. We have already pointed out that the same is practi-
cally the case with M., whom we presume to be violet blind. We may therefore deduce
the fact that the monochromatic vision in this case is of a totally different type to that
of P. and Q., and that the last sensation to be lost is the same as that of M. If any
violet sensation were present in either, the fact would be made evident by the order
of the extinction. The sensation of B. C. is thus apparently the green sensation,
though that this particular sensation is exactly the same as that absent in the green
blind is not certain; his curve agrees very closely in form and position with that
deduced by Ka:nta by different methods as that of the green sensation,
