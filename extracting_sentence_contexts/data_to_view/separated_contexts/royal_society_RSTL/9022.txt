from the attached end of a
severed marginal strip entirely failing to cause localizing action of the polypite. Lastly,
we have seen that even after all localizing action of the polypite has been completely
destroyed by section of the kinds described, this organ nevertheless continues actively,
though ineffectually, to search for the seat of irritation. (4) The last-mentioned fact shows that after excitational continuity of a higher order
has been destroyed, excitational continuity of a lower order nevertheless persists. Or,
to state the case in other words, the fact in question shows that after severance of the
almost exclusively radial connexions between the bell and the polypite by which the
perfect or impaired localizing function of the latter is rendered possible, other connexions
between these organs remain which are not in any wise radial. I therefore next tested
the degree in which these non-radial connexions might be cut without causing
destruction of that excitational continuity of a lower order which it is their function
to maintain.
