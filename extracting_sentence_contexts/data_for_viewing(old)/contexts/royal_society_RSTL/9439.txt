effects. But such is nob the case. From the commencement to the end the special
effects are wholly dissimilar to the relief-effects, showing clearly that the special effects
cannot be due to an alteration in intensity of the same kind of electrical pulses that
produce the relief-effects, but must be due to pulses of an opposite character.

This is, of course, not the only proof that the electrical pulses that produce the two
effects are of opposite kinds. In fact, an examination of the appearances of the two
effects is almost enough to convince the observer that it is impossible that one can
