Otner AFFERENT CRANIAL NERVES,

The other afferent cranial nerves which were the subject of experiment are the
trigerainus and the glossopharyngeus.

(a) Division of the Sensory Trigeminal Root between the Gasserian Ganglion and
the Pons (Exp. 20).

As the degenerations following this lesion have been elsewhere (15) fully detailed,
it is considered necessary here only to recapitulate the chief facts, This operation
was invariably followed by degeneration of the so-called “ascending ” trigeminal root

in the pons and medulla oblongata, which was traced spinalwards as far as the
tubercle of Ronanpo. This root progressively diminishes in size as it is traced
distally by the passage of its fibres into the subjacent gelatinous substance. As no
degeneration was observed to pass from this structure into the tegmentum, or into
the posterior horn, it was evident that in this substance lay the end-nucleus of the
sensory trigeminal fibres whose cells of origin are situated in the Gasserian ganglion.
That the secondary neurons arising in the gelatinous substance cross the raphé, and
