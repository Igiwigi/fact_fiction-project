Comparison of Curves Nos. 19, 20, 21, and 22, which illustrate the process of
recovery after the passage of the fourth yield-point, shows a similar large difference
between recovery at the ordinary temperature and that at 60° C. (140° Fahr.). In this
case Curve No. 21 (obtained 16 hours after No. 20) shows that the material has
yielded more, after its long rest, except for the higher loads. This apparent
weakening is, of course, not due to the resting, but to the fact that the re-applica-
tion of the load, necessary to obtain the readings for Curve No. 20, has had the effect
of further overstraining the material to a slight extent. A curve obtained immedi-
ately after No. 20 would have fallen below that curve and also below Curve No, 21,
while reaching approximately the same top point as No. 20. It may here be
remarked that all the curves of this diagram have been obtained from first loadings
