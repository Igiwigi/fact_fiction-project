In com-
non with Professor Beer, I examined a great number of crystals, in order to find a
-;eneral law between the position of the magnetic axes of a crystal and its optic axes
or the different colours, but without a satisfactory result. 'The laws mentioned in the
—econd paragraph of these additional pages, by means of which we can in the simpler
—ases deduce from the primitive form of a crystal the position of the axes of both auxi-
Jary ellipsoids, the magnetic and the optic—and also of all snch auxiliary ellipsoids
Segarding, for instance, molecular elasticity, conduction of heat and electricity—are all
Fe know. .
15 T added this note to my original paper, in order to explain more distinctly than 1 did
Sefore the analogy between the optic and magnetic axes, which guided me during the
*Sifferent stages of my researches on the magnetic induction of crystals. My intention
as not at all to enter into the mathematical solution of the great physical problem. Sill my experimental researches follow from the mere fact, that there exists an auxiliary
Mlipzoid of magnetic induction. The supposition of molecular ellipsoids of isotropic,
{Saramagnetic or diamagnetic matter, is to be regarded as a means of discovering the
| Kathematical laws to which the couple, tending to turn round a magnecrystal in a uni-
rm field, was subject, and not as establishing these laws on a basis of molecular physics. Such a basis is to be obtained by Professxor W.
