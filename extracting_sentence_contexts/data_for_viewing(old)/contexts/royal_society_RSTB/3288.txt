tions being spoken of as the corona. The leaf-trace bundles arise in the grooves
between the angles of the corona. So far the structure may be closely compared
with that of a Eusigillarian stem. But the secondary vascular tissues in these
plants were anomalous, whereas in Sigillaria scutellata they are of the normal
.type.

Probably the nearest approach to the Sigillarize, from an anatomical point of view,
is to be found in the Lower Carboniferous stems from Arran and Dalmeny. The
Arran trunk was referred by Wittiamsont to the genus Lepidodendron as
L. Wunschianum. Others have admitted the possibility that it may have been a
Lepidophloios, but it must be remembered that the external features of this tree have
never been observed, and that these opinions are arrived at entirely from the internal
structure. The importance of bearing these facts in mind is emphasised by the
recent discoveries: that at least two Lepidodendrons possessed the type of structure
hitherto regarded as characteristic of Lepidophloios. The Dalmeny stem was
described by Sewarp and Hix} as possibly identical with Lepidophloios Harcourtit
(Wrrnam). Here again the external features are unknown.

In both the Arran and Dalmeny trunks, the primary wood, which is crenulated
externally, forms a ring bounding a well-marked pith, The leaf-traces arise from the
grooves of the corona, and secondary wood of the normal centrifugal type is present.
So far the comparison with the Sigillarias described here is close. The leaf-traces,
however, in the Dalmeny stem where they leave the secondary wood, are diploxylic.
This feature is unknown in either of the two ribbed Sigillarias so far fully described,
but it does occur, as has been pointed out, in the Subsigillarize (S. Menardi and
