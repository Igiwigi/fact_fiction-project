Monochlorobenzene.

‘This compound causes a powerful effect upon reflex ; it is, in fact, one of the most
active bodies in the series. In about one-half of the experiments a shortening of the
reflex period was produced immediately after injection. The reduction varied from
5 second to 1°5 second, and was never present for more than 30 minutes after the
injection had been made.
