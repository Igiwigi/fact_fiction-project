Each successive layer is then formed as the crystal
solidifies by the particles immediately behind those of the newly solidified layer
slipping sideways into their places. Further, in the case contemplated, each dotted circle in the figure may be taken
te represent a line of particles perpendicular to the plane of the drawing, which are
packed as closely as the particles along a eube edge in the erystal, 7.Â¢., as closely as
the horizontal lines of particles. The act of crystallisation will then consist in the
deposition of such lines all parallel to the cube edge, but so widely spaced as to lie in
a vicinal plane (0k/), This corresponds with the fact that the vicinal planes, though
they vary in inclination, always belong to well defined zones; in this instance they
will lie in the cube zone, and sodium chlorate possibly affords an example of vicinal
planes of the sort depicted in fig. 21. The determinations made above enable us to compare the weight of material
contained in a given volume of the crystal with the weight of the same material in
the same volume of the solution; that is to say, the density of the substance in the
erystal with its density in the immediate neighbourhood of the erystal, ignoring the
solvent.
