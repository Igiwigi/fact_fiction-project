128 MESSRS. J. N. LANGLEY AND H. M. FLETCHER

It will be seen on comparing I. and II. that clamping the carotid increases the
percentage of salts from “499 to °512, although the rate of secretion falls from
1°55 cc. to ‘50 ec, a minute; so also in IX., clamping the carotid during dyspnoea
increases the percentage of salts considerably more than does dyspnoea alone (VIIL).

It will be seen also that clamping the carotid has a very great after-effect ; this is,
in fact, in IIL and V. greater than the effect whilst the carotid is clamped; thus in
IIL, collected after removing the clamp from the carotid, the percentage of salts rises
from ‘512 to ‘674, whilst the rate of secretion falls from ‘5 cc. a minute to *128.
That the after-effect is slight on clamping for the third time may have been due to
the much longer duration—half-an-hour—of the closure of the carotid.

Clamping the carotid increases also somewhat the percentage of organic substance
above that which corresponds to the rate of secretion of saliva (¢f. VIII. and IX.),

A similar result was obtained in Experiment 8.
