processes, substrate and product concentrations far exceed those usually experienced in Nature
and enzymes are confronted with molecules that are often structurally very different to their
natural substrates [26]. Moreover, substrates and products are frequently hydrophobic and
enzymes need to be tolerant to organic solvents that are added to enhance substrate solubility.
Generally speaking, for commercial viability, product concentrations should be at least 100 g.1-1;
Space-Time Yields greater than 10g.1-h~! and catalyst productivities greater than 100g of
product per g of enzyme [27]. This was enabled by dramatic developments in new enzyme
discovery (more enzymes) and enzyme performance (better enzymes).

(a) Enzyme discovery in the age of (meta)genomics

Historically, enzyme discovery involved preparing microbial cultures from environmental
samples and was seriously hindered by the fact that 99% of microorganisms are ‘unculturable’.
This changed irrevocably with the advent of (meta)genomics, that is the sequencing and
annotating (identifying the individual genes and their functions) of genomes of numerous
individual organisms contained in genetic material derived from environmental samples [28].
The first two bacterial genomes were sequenced in 1995 [29]. The subsequent introduction of
next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies [30] dramatically reduced the cost of genome
sequencing (figure 4). The National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) has tracked
these costs at sequencing centres that they funded [31].

In 2014, ca. 30000 bacterial genomes had already been sequenced. This exponentially
expanding genomic data, contained in publicly accessible databases, can be mined in silico to
search for sequence homology with existing enzymes of known function, thus enabling the
identification of countless new enzymes. At the same time, the cost of gene synthesis has
