62 BE. J, SALISBURY ON THE CAUSES AND ECOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF

(f) Stomatai index and leaf area—It has been shown that the stomatal frequency
tends to augment with a diminution in leaf area, and, in general, one would expect that
this negative correlation is an outcome of the fact that conditions favourable to the
erowth of the leaf as a whole will be also favourable to growth of the epidermal cells.
The following data taken from several species show that there is no obvious relation
between leaf size and the value of the stomatal index, which confirms the view that the
frequency is determined mainly by epidermal growth. In other words, the factors
which govern leaf size have apparently no influence on the proportion of stomata formed.
