for formation of magnetite and Fe oxidation. However, ferroan brucite has the potential to reduce
water, carbon dioxide and other species in secondary reactions producing hydrogen and Fe(II/III)
oxides and hydroxides. Thus, there are a variety of routes to iron oxidation and hydrogen
generation that do not directly involve serpentine.

Moving onto more specific effects on microbial activity, Lang & Brazelton [7] review the
conditions for subsurface life in the subsurface of the LCHE, concluding that the combination
of high pH, high T and lack of bioavailable CO2 is very challenging, with implications for


the habitability of the subsurface on ocean worlds such as Europa and Enceladus. Boyd et
al. [8] resolve a paradox that early anaerobic autotrophic bacteria apparently used ferredoxins
(iron-sulfur proteins) as electron donors despite the fact that the reduction potential of Hz is
not generally low enough to efficiently reduce ferredoxins. They show that a combination of
high Hz concentration and alkaline pH reduce the reduction potential of Hz, an indication that
serpentinizing systems are favourable for the emergence of autotrophic life.

Looking at astrobiology, Vance [9] reviews evidence for the occurrence of serpentine on Mars,
Enceladus, Titan and Europa, and details a model for the rate of advance of a cracking front that
predicts the extent of serpentinization and associated hydrogen generation over time as these
bodies cooled.

Finally, Hansen et al. [10] document experiments on nanoindentation of the serpentine
polymorph antigorite indicating that deformation at high pressures is dominated by sliding on
shear cracks rather than dislocation movement.
