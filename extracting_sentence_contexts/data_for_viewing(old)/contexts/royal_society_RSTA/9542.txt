from the cathode is reduced. Such a reduction might be caused by the formation of
an electric double layer at the surface of the cathode which would create a force
tending to drag out the electrons. There is already a considerable amount of
evidence of the existence of these double layers in certain cases, and this view has
been put forward to explain the action of hydrogen in increasing the electron
emission from platinum.*

The author is of opinion that at present there is not sufficient experimental
evidence to enable us to explain the manner in which the presence of a gas in the
discharge tube acts in increasing the negative thermionic emission, but it is not
improbable that the method by which this increase is brought about is different in
different cases; for instance, when oxygen comes in contact with a calcium cathode
at a high temperature, the increased emission is doubtless due to the fact that the
emission from the product of the chemical action—lime—is greater than the emission
from calcium at the same temperature. The possibilities of ionisation by collisions
need also to be carefully investigated. Recent experiments have shown that the
electric intensity required to produce this effect is very much smaller than has been
supposed, and the process is probably always going on near a glowing cathode at low
pressures. It must be remembered also that the gas pressure in the neighbourhood
of a cathode which is continually evolving gas may be considerably greater than that
measured in more remote parts of the apparatus, so that it is difficult to estimate the
magnitude of the effect of ionisation by collisions.
