This is illustrated in figure 4a, which shows the experimental points for the MQC
distribution at tp = 2001s together with the fittings using L =2. Fittings with L=1 and L=2
are displayed in figure 4b (data corresponding to tp = 2001s), for the sake of comparison. The
fact that a single Gaussian is insufficient to represent the MQC for all the orders becomes
evident. Returning to figure 4a, the two-Gaussian fitting yields a good agreement with the experimental
data for all coherence orders n 4 0. As discussed above, So(tp) carries information not only on the
ZQC intensities resulting from correlated spins, but also polarization attributable to spins that
become decorrelated by decoherence and various non-idealities.
