It must
have been taken up, either as free or combined nitrogen, either directly through the
foliage, or indirectly through the soil and nutritive solutions, and the roots.

4,—It is possible that the negative results of BousstnGAULtT, and ourselves, are due
to the liberation of free nitrogen. The conditions were, moreover, such as to exclude
the action of electricity and of microbes.

5.—Since Berruetor has shown that nitrogen may be fixed in organic matter by
the agency of electricity, and in soils by the agency of micro-organisms, some cases of
gain may be so explained; but it is considered that the cunditions for such actions did
not exist in his own experiments. The balance of evidence favours the assumption
that the plants themselves were the agents.

6.—The conclusion that plants acquire atmospheric nitrogen accords with, and

explains, facts of vegetable production otherwise unexplained; and the fact of its
acquisition in considerable quantities seems well established. We have pointed out that in BertHEtot’s later papers he seems fo rely much more
on the agency of micro-organisms, than on that of electricity, in explanation of the
phenomena of the fixation of free nitrogen; whilst ArwarerR does not consider that
the conditions of his own experiments are favourable to the supposition that either
of these agencies was the cause of the fixation which his results show. It need only be added, that the assumption that the real gains are generally greater
than the experimental results indicate, on account of the losses that have taken place,
is a very old one, it having been brought against the negative results obtained by
BoussinGAutt, and at Rothamsted, thirty or more years ago.
