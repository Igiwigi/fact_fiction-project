But in respect of the nature of rhythm in speech and to adopt a different view-
two plausible conceptualizations of rhythm, we can agree point, one which questions the presupposition that there is a

rhythm with its implied synchronization of one or more realm of religion, departing from a strict theistic stance and
unit to an external clock, and that the notion of contrastive adopting an agnostic one. Rather than taking a phenomenon

requires turning a blind eye to the actual phonetic properties metric.
