A the active cells stains more or less deeply.

N This is opposed to the observations of NussBAUM, but NUs8BAUM, T think, directed
E his attention 80 much to the granules contained by the cells that he overlooked the
= cell-protoplasm.

= T have nob been able to satisfy myself of the meaning of this increase in 8taining-
E) power of the protoplasm. Since the granules split up during activity, we might
Ã¾& imagine that the cells do not at once cast out the whole of the substances formed, but
= retain a certain proportion, and that this diffused throughout the cell causes it to stain
b= more than normally with osmic acid.

Z There is, however, another way of looking at the fact. Generally speaking, the
Z formation of granules goes hand-in-hand with a diminution in the power of staining of

the cell-substance. In the latter period of digestion, when the granules are increasing
the cell-snbstance stains less and less with osmic acid. In Triton teniatns during the
rapid increase in the granules which takes place from the fourth to the eighth hour of
digestion there is a rapid diminution in the staining power of the cell.

This would indicate that the protoplasm of the cells, in passing through those
changes which result in the formation of granules, uses np the substance stainable
with osmic acid. This substance might be eibher taken up by the cell during secretion
to be further assimilated, or it might be an integral part of the cell-protoplasm.
