& It is important to notice that for this conclusion to be true, it is not necessary that
Sthe problem of estimation should be the same in all the cases. For instance, during
‘=a period of time the statistician may deal with a thousand problems of estimation and
~in each the parameter 6, to be estimated and the probability law of the X’s may be
different. As far as in each case the functions 6 (E) and 6 (E) are properly calculated
gand correspond to the same value of «, his steps (a), (b), and (c), though different in
‘adetails of sampling and arithmetic, will have this in common—the probability of their
Sresulting in a correct statement will be the same, «. Hence the frequency of actually
Scorrect statements will approach «.

‘2 It will be noticed that in the above description the probability statements refer
2to the problems of estimation with which the statistician will be concerned in the
Sfuture. In fact, I have repeatedly stated that the frequency of correct results will
tend to «.* Consider now the case when a sample, E’, is already drawn and the
Zcalculations have given, say, 9 (E’) = 1 and 0 (E’) = 2. Can we say that in this
“particular case the probability of the true value of 6, falling between 1 and 2 is equal
Sto « ?

~ The answer is obviously in the negative. The parameter 6, isan unknown constant
“Sand no probability statement concerning its value may be made, that is except for
the hypothetical and trivial ones
