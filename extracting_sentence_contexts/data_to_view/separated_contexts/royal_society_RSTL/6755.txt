The last column of this Table is thus found ;—

Let the principal components of the incident polarized beam, in and perpendicular to
the plane of incidence, be cos « and sin « (unity denoting the incident beam); and let
I and J denote what a unit of light becomes after reflexion, in and perpendicular to the
plane of incidence respectiyely ; then the principal components of the reflected beam are
I cos and J in, and therefore

T=tan ! cot «; - CO nel oh os A TONY

and the angle tan”! (1) may be found from this equation without any difficulty. According to the theory of FRESNEL,
J __cos (i+r)

Icos (i—r)

an expression which vanishes at the polarizing angle (i+r=90"), and therefore
tan=(7) ought at this angle of incidence to vanish also; but we find, not only in this

experiment, but in those which follow, that it does not vanish, but only reaches a mini-
mum, the tangent of which is sensibly equal to what I have called the Coefficient of
Reflexion®. In fact, let > denote the angle whose cotangent is this coefficient. Then I cosa, J 8m a
are the principal components of the reflected light, which by definition is circularly
polarized, and therefore I cos a=9 sin a, and

J
cot A=T

The coefficients of Refraction and Reflexion, as determined by this experiment, are

therefore
Coefficient, of Refraction=tan 54* 57'=1:4255. Coefficient of Reflexion =cot 84* 31'=0:0960.

* Strictly speaking the angle of incidence at which the maximum is reached is found to be 80mewhat less than
the Principal Incidence,
