resent particular features distinguishing it from the integrable case. In fact,
his query does not have a definite answer, partially because we still do not
know the precise border between the classical and quantum realms. A partial
and rather speculative explanation has its foundations in an important point
raised by Einstein [62] in 1917. Yet in the pre-QM era, the so-called Einstein
Brillouin-Keller (EBK) rules [51] already would lead to the (semiclassical)
quantization of a problem in terms of invariant tori of the classical phase space.
But such structures are possible only for integrable systems. Hence, Einstein
yointed out that the quantization of chaotic dynamics was not possible in that
way. Many years later, in breakthrough work, Gutzwiller derived his famous
race formula [51,63]. It associates the quantum spectra density of states with
he periodic orbits of the classical problem. Without going into detail, the
exact mathematical form of such an expression (in fact, of its pre-exponential
amplitudes) is different if one has either a fully chaotic or a completely integrable
classical dynamics [64]. So, the whole issue is that from a formal point of view,
he semiclassical description in QM presents mathematical distinctions for the
chaotic and integrable cases.

Let us now recall the correspondence principle. It states that below the
Ehrenfest time (which again can belong to completely different scales for
integrable and chaotic systems, typically being much shorter for the latter),
somehow classical and QMs should be similar if i is small compared with other
