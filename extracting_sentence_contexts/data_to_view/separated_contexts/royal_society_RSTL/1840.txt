263, If different parts move in opposite directions across the magnetic
curves, then the effect is a maximum for equal velocities. 264. All these in fact are variations of one simple condition, namely, that all
parts of the mass shall not move in the same direction across the curyes, and
with the same angular velocity. But they are forms of expression which being
retained in the mind, I have found useful when comparing the consistency of
particular phenomena with general results. Royal Institution,
