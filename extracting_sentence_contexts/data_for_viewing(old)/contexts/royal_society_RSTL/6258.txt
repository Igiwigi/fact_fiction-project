6. Effect of Heating in a current of Ammonia.

Several experimenters state, that when copper is heated in ammonia, the gas is decom-
posed and nitride of copper formed, a fact which ScaRo0TTER® disputes, and has been
proved totally incorrect by Dick. We repeated the experiment by heating a copper
wire, whose conducting power had been previously determined, for a quarter of an hour
in a current of dry ammonia ; when cold, the conducting power was found the same, and
the wire was as ductile as before. In all probability the reason why in the experiments
of previous observers the copper became brittle, was (as already suggested by Dick)
that they used copper containing suboxide.

T. Effect of the Metals.

The electric conductivity of copper is not 80 much impaired by the presence of small
quantities of foreign metals as by that of the metalloids; it is, however, very considerably
diminished by iron and tin.
