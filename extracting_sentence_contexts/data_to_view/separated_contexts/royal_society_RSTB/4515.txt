Within the protoplasm of these organisms the woody material
3 @ undergoes chemical changes, and, when ejected from the bodies of the Protozoa, much
: of it is in a condition capable of being assimilated as food by the host Termite. How
8 and where assimilation actually takes place is a difficult physiological problem,
involving a knowledge of micro-chernical methods which I do not possess. A
significant fact is that the ligneous particles are not subjected to the action of the
secretions of the mid-gut. Their passage through the latter appears to be very rapid,
and on no occasion have I found woody matter in that region of the digestive system. The mid-gut frequently contains a thick fluid material which also extends up into
the ceca.
