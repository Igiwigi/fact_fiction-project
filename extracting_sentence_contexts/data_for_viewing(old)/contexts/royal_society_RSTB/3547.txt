the newer Specimen H, has further shown us that, in this later stage, the ganglionic
cell-elements have become more dispersed and separated from one another ; so that to
ocular appearance the tissue is almost indistinguishable from mesodermal tissue.
Further, in Hiin and Marrtiy’s Specimen M, the original cellular continuity, between
the trigeminal ganglionic expansion of the neural crest and the edge of the medullary
plate, has seemingly disappeared to a somewhat greater extent than even in the
nearly related Specimen H; and this in turn shows a far less intimate and extensive
continuity than is present in the earlier stage represented by Specimens Z and ZZ.
Nevertheless, even in Specimen M, and still more in H, we find in the sections, in
certain planes, a definite persistence of the original connection between the ganglionic
plate and the edge of the medullary plate.

As a matter of fact, Hm. and Marrin were influenced in their interpretation by
SeLeNKA’s view of the mesodermal character of the unquestionably similar head-plates
which he observed in the cephalic region in Didelphys (86-7). They quote his
judgment with regard to these, that they “ gehéren offenbar zur Urwirbelplatte des
Kopfes.” There can be no doubt that SrLrenKa was entirely mistaken in this
judgment. We have specially investigated this point in various specimens of
Dasyurus embryos collected by one of us (H.) in connection with his work on the
embryology of Marsupials. In this marsupial form we find the clearest possible
confirmation of the ganglionic character of the so-called “head-plates.” This is
strongly suggested in the surface-view of the embryo .in fig. 78, and is convincingly
borne out by the study of the serial sections referred to later on in these pages.
The Trigeminus-plate in Dasyurus is, indeed, far more obviously ganglionic than even
in Ornithorhynchus. ;
