Further, Bunsen and Roscor showed that there was a
definite absorption of light associated with the combination—more than was absorbed
by an equal quantity of damp chlorine. One, therefore, or both of the constants ¢,,
¢, depends on the light intensity. This also appears from the fact that the effect of
insolation persists for some time after the mixture is darkened. If c, and c, were
both independent of the intensity of the light, we should expect that in a short time
the H,O, Cl, molecules would all be used up, and that the gas would very soon
return to its normal condition. But the effect of previous insolation can persist for
several hours.
