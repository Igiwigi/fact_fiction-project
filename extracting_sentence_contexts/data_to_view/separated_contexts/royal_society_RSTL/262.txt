IV, 9g. © A star situated upon a ground of extremely” faint
< milky nebulosity diftused over this part of the heavens, has
« a, milky. chevelure surrounding it, which is brighter..than
«the, nebulosity of the ground ; but which loses itself imper-
« ceptibly in the extreme faintness of the general diftusion of
< the nebulous matter.” See fig. g. . The formation of these objects is extremely instructive,,as
it manifests the affinity between the matter of which stars are
composed, and that of the most unshapen chaotic mass of ne
bulosity. For the vanishing chevelure of a star being equally
connected, on the one hand, with the generally diffused nebu-
lous matter, and on the other with the star itself, round which
it is in a state of gradual condensation.; this double union de-
notes the mutual gravitation of the whole mass of nebulosity
and the star towards each other; and unless this. proof, can be .
invalidated, we must admit the fact of the growing condition
of stars, that are in the situation which has been pointed out. This argument also adds greatly to the probability of stars

being 'originally formed by a condensation of the nebulous
matter; for; as'it now appears that stars must receive an addi-
tion to' their s0lid contents, when they are in contact with ne-
bulosity, there is an evident possibility of their being originally
formed' of 'it.
