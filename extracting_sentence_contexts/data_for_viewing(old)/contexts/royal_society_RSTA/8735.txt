potential energy per unit volume: this latter term will be a function of the electric
and magnetic polarisations in the media, but will be assumed not to depend to any
appreciable extent on the rates of variation of these conditions, and in so far as some
of the internal energy is essentially of kinetic type, it will be in reality a sort of
modified Lagrangian function with the energy corresponding to the motional terms
converted to potential energy in the usual way. The function L, may also be taken to
include a part arising from the assumed inertia of any free electrons that may be
present.
The motion of the system can now be expressed in the form

a f'ae | [1.-wi+ tee] a

and we could conduct the variation directly were it not for the fact that our functions
are not all expressed explicitly in terms of the independent co-ordinates of the
systems, which are in reality the position co-ordinates of the elements of matter and
electricity. As indicated above we can however avoid the use of any such explicit
interpretation by the use of undetermined multipliers. In this way the variations of
E and B can be temporarily rendered independent of each other and of the
actual co-ordinates of the material and electrical elements.

We know that the vectors of the theory are connected with one another and the
actual co-ordinates of the system by the equations
