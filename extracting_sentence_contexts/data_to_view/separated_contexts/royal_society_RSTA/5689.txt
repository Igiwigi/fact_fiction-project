This estimate holds true for all 0<6 <6d,. We will take liminfs_,9+ on both sides of the
inequality, recalling that lim infs_,9+ =lim,_,9+ infp<s<~. We will use the following facts: ®,,
and &), 1 are decreasing diffeomorphisms, and, since z’*(5) > Rj, for 0<6 <6, and (z"*)' <
G,(z"*), it follows that, at least in the interval (0,6;,), tr z'*(t) is non-increasing. However,
we would like to have z’*(8) <z'*(0), 0<6 <6d,. If z*(0)=+00 then this inequality follows
trivially.
