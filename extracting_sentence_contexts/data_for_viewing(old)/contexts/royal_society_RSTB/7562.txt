be expected of an important cause of the destruction. This of course depends on the
assumption about variation in cell potency from animal to animal, cell potency being
defined as the ratio of the destructive power of the cell to the resistance of the graft tissues.
It can be remarked on this point that it is more economical to assume that the variation
(if any) is randomly distributed rather than to make the two assumptions: (a) that the
cell potency is greater in those animals whose grafts are destroyed faster and (b) that this
effect is strong enough to mask a relationship between cell numbers and speed of graft
breakdown.

Mature plasma cells alone fulfilled the fourth condition listed above for an effect, in
that there was a positive relation (P=0-05) between the amount of graft tissue destruction
occurring between the eighth and twelfth day after transplantation and the increase in
concentration of these cells during that time. The fact that during this interval the
lymphocytes usually increased in concentration in the slower-destroyed graft sets and
decreased in the faster—and that there was a suggestive negative relationship (P about
1 in 19) between lymphocyte increment and amount of graft destruction—does not
necessarily mean that they have fulfilled the fourth requirement listed for a cause. The
decrease in lymphocytes may have occurred in other ways than by disintegration in the
grafts, although some disintegration clearly took place. In this connexion, it should be
observed that the immune reaction had begun—to judge from the strong inflammation—
before the lymphocyte disintegration occurred.

The percentage of pyronin cells (of the total lymphocytes plus pyronin cells) in the
graft was, by the nature of the cell counts, more accurately estimated than the cell con-
centrations. The percentage was found to be lower in the grafts at 8 days the faster the
