In mos cases the absorption
curve is peculiar and often strikingly characteristic, and only minute quantities of
material are actually required for obtaining measurements of spectra- from which such
curves may be plotted. The interest that attaches to an examination of the absorption
spectra of the alkaloids is not alone the fact that a means of recognising, detecting,
and estimating, sxuch substances may be devised, but still more that we may learn
something of their chemical constitution. The experimental details. The method of examination employed was that, deseribed in the Phil.
