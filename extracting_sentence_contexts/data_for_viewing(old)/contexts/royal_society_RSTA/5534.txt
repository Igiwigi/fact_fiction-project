An agent needs to have a cognitive architecture, whereby information and processes are
organized in a modular and efficient way to carry out the cognitive functions required to
achieve its own objectives. A synthesis of the component parts of the discussion so far forms
the architecture proposed in figure 2. It recognizes the importance of sensors and actuators
in communication as we discussed in the syntactic view on communication. These sensors
and actuators act together for active reception and transmission of information. The cognitive
processes underlying the formation, encoding, decoding and integration of messages with social
models need the three constituents of discourse. This is due to the fact that the longer the
bi-directional interaction between two agents, the more pertinent it is to have components of
the cognitive architecture that support the discourse between these two agents. Without these
