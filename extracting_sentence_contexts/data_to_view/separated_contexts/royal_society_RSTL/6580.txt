Comparing ether yapour with olefiant gas, it is, T think, evident that the
radiant points of the attenuated vapour which depresses the mercury column only 0-5 of
an inch, are further apart than those of the gas which depresses the column 30 inches. Consequently there is a wider door open for the radiation of the distant ether particles
towards the pile than for the distant particles of olefiant gas. The length of the whole
column, in fact, might be available for the radiation of the vapour, and a part of it only
available for the gas. Cut off this unavailable portion from the gas column, and we do
not mjure its efficacy ; but cut off a sinilar length from the vapour column, and we may
materially diminish its effect. Speaking generally, by reducing the column of ether and
that of gas by the same amount, the diminution of radiation will be most sensibly felt
where the radiant points are furthest asunder.
