(c) The rise in the number of red corpuscles and correspondingly in the quantity of
hemoglobin.

These three factors may be regarded at first as independent variables and an
attempt made to appraise their relative importance. he attempt has necessitated
an enquiry into the Jaws which govern diffusion in the lungs and the tissues. This
enquiry makes it obvious that :—

(1) The colour of the blood in the lungs must be almost that of arterial blood,
whilst the colour of blood in the tissue capillaries approach that of the venous blood
which emerges from the tissue in question.

(2) An explanation is found for the fact that, at high altitudes, the arterial blood
darkens when exercise is taken, whilst it does not do so to an appreciable extent at
the sea-level. It is also explained why the arterial blood should darken on exercise
in lung complaints in which the permeability of the lung wall, or the surface of
capillaries in the lung (see Appendix VI), is diminished—either will reduce the
diffusion coefficient.

Working from Bohr’s method of graphic integration, it appears that fall of alveolar
pressure tends to depress the region of oxygen utilisation in two ways :—

(1) It lowers limiting the percentage saturation which the arterial blood could
attain if it achieved an equilibrium with the alveolar air.
