54 PROFESSOR W. M. HICKS ON VORTEX MOTION.

These numbers are graphically represented in fig. 1, Plate 1, where the abscissze
give E/E, and the ordinates V/V). Dotted lines refer to points where calculation
cannot be applied. On the same figure are placed outlines of the aggregates drawn
to scale. Two things at once strike the eye. First, that the spherical aggregate
evidently lies on the E.V curve of the rings, belongs, in fact, to the same family ;
and, secondly, that the variation of V with the energy is small over a very large
range. The shape and nature of the aggregate when the energy is nearly that of the
spherical form have not yet been determined. It is probable that as the energy
diminishes the form lengthens along the polar axis, until when the energy is very
small it becomes a long, thin, cylindrical aggregate. When this is so long that the
end portions form only a small portion of the whole, it is possible to obtain an
approximation to the energy, for when very long the fluid outside will be very
nearly at rest (as in case of force outside a long helix). The velocity of propagation
will then be the velocity at the axis. Let a be the radius of the cylinder, / its

length. Then
