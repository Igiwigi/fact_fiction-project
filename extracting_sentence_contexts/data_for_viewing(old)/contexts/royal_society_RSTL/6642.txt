sented in the figure.
Now if tangential dislocation take place, it must necessarily do 80 in those directions
in which the tendency of the forces F to produce it is greatest, or, in the case before
us, in directions parallel and perpendicular to the axis of the glacier, the tendencies
being the same in both those directions. Let us suppose, then, a complete tangential
rupture to take place, and simultaneously, on each side of the element pg 7's, as well as
in the surrounding elements. Each element, represented by p'q'r's, will then regain its
original rectangular form by its elasticity, but 80 moving that its centre of gravity (9')
shall remain at rest, since the elastic force of restitution acts entirely within the element.
Thus pq 7s will return to its original rectangular form p'q"7"s"; and if we take two con-
secutive elements whose centres of gravity are G and G/, they will be brought into the
relative positions represented in the figure, in which G' is slightly in advance of G, as
much, in fact, as is necessitated by the more rapid motion of the central parts of the
glacier. After the rupture, if we suppose the continuity to be instantaneously restored
(as it will be by regelation according to'our theory), the glacier will again be brought
as continuous mass into a position of no constraint by its general motion. By a repe-
tition of this process, the continuity of the mass will be constantly destroyed and as
constantly Testored; and we thus see the modus operandi by which, taking any two
elements Situated like G and G', the one nearest the axis of the glacier gets gradually
in advance of the other, as it must do, in accordance with the general law of the
glacier's motion.
37. But, it may be asked, if the dislocation takes place on the two sides of the
element whose directions are transverse to the glacier, simultaneously with the rupture
along the Sides whoze directions are longitudinal, why is it that the subsequent relative
- ys gy motion of two contiguous elements, such as G and G', should not be
