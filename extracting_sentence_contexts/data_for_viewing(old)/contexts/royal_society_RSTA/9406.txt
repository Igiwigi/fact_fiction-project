in which, for purposes of integration, Q would be expressed in terms of 7+U, v)+V,
w+W by (2). In the integrals (8) to (5), and elsewhere throughout the paper,
integrations with respect to the velocity components are understood to be taken
over all values of the variables, from — © to + ©.

The equations (4) may, in the notation just introduced, be expressed as follows :—

(6) U=V=W=o0.

The Velocity-distribution Function for a Uniform Gas.

§2(D) When the gas is uniform, all the derivatives of T and of (1%, 1, w,) are zero,
and f must depend only on m, T, and (U,V, W). It has, in fact, been shown by
MAXweE-t and others* that

The Distribution Function for a Non-uniform Gas.

§2(E) When the gas is slightly non-uniform, / will differ slightly from the value
given by (7), which we shall denote by /,: we may therefore write
