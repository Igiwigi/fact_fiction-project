HOPKINS ON THE THEORY OF THE MOTION OF GLACIERS. 709

I have proved that they must in all cases differ by an angle of 45*. IT have thought it
right to say thus much to vindicate my claim to having been the first to give any expla-
nation, founded on true mechanical principles, of the phenomena in question.

32, That the theoretical law above enunciated with respect to the directions of trans-

had been made on glacial motion, that it was regarded as a proof that the sides of a
