properties of the elements. As is well known, the sequence of increasing atomic weights of
the elements provides the ordering principle or the backbone upon which the entire edifice of
the periodic table depends. By arranging the elements in order of increasing atomic weight, it
becomes clear that chemical periodicity or repetition occurs after regular intervals.

3. The first hints of chemical periodicity

The first hint of chemical periodicity is beyond any doubt due to the German chemist Wolfgang
Dobereiner, who starting in 1827 began to discover what we know as triads of elements [9]. He
realized that there were several sets of three elements among which one element had an atomic
weight that was approximately the average of the other two. For example, sodium has an atomic
weight of approximately 23 and thus represents the average of the weight of lithium (7) and
that of potassium (39). This fact alone is already suggestive but it becomes even more suggestive
when combined with the realization that the chemical and physical properties of sodium are also
intermediate between those of lithium and potassium. It therefore appears that a relationship
between atomic weights is able to capture a relationship between the properties of different
elements.

In retrospect, Débereiner had essentially discovered chemical periodicity since what underlies
the existence of triads is the fact that sodium and potassium occur are regular distances away
from lithium in terms of the sequence of increasing atomic weights. But of course Débereiner did
not produce a periodic table but only the discovery of several disconnected triads.

Another powerful hint which was to take a longer time to reach full fruition was the discovery
made by the Scottish physician William Prout, who was working in London. On examining a list
