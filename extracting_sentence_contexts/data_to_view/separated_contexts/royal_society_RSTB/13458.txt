For each, we will then solve for the signalling change in reputation as Ag; = qj â€” qi-1, the difference in
probability for high and low quality individuals (ie. the reputation after the public signalling event compared to
Bayesian Nash equilibrium strategy profiles), as a function before the event (reputation before the event is assumed to
of their social prominence/ capital. be 0.5 for all individuals). In the hybrid equilibrium, S; does not affect change in
reputation. Although S; directly increases reputational gain,

(a) Mechanism 1: altered prior this effect is offset by the fact that P*(rlq=0, S;) increases
Our first intervention is to allow the prior 7; to depend on S;, with $;, which reduces the reputational gain. In the pooling
our term for either social prominence or social capital. S; is equilibrium in which everyone signals, signalling itself is
benchmarked against the individuals with the highest and not informative.
