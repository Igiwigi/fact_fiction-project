o However free we are in mathematical work in using wordings we find convenient,
g as long as they are clearly defined, our choice must be justified in one way or another.
= The justification of the way of speaking about the definition of the measure within
2 the fundamental probability set in terms of imaginary random experiments lies in
£ the empirical fact, which BorrKmewicz insisted on calling the law of big numbers.
‘4 This is that, given a purely mathematical definition of a probability set including
"3 the appropriate measure, we are able to construct a real experiment, possible to
@carry out in any laboratory, with a certain range of possible results and such that if
‘git is repeated many times, the relative frequencies of these results and their different
4 combinations in small series approach closely the values of probabilities as calculated
éfrom the definition of the fundamental probability set. Examples of such real
random experiments are provided by the experience of roulette (BorTKIEwICz,
£1917), by the experiment with throwing a needle* so as to obtain an analogy to the
"= problem of Buffon, and by various sampling experiments based on Tippert’s Tables
£ of random numbers (1927).
3 These examples show that the random experiments corresponding in the sense
‘described to mathematically defined probability sets are possible. However,
