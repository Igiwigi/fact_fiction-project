Of course it cannot be intended here to speak with any disrespect of the persons
who have calculated tide tables under these circumstances. Their labours are useful
to the community in proportion as their tables are exact, which some of them are to
a very remarkable degree. And, as no one thinks of condemning other persons who
make a profit of any peculiar and secret knowledge which they may possess con-
nected with any of the useful arts, there would be no justice in blaming those who
do the same with respect to secrets which concern one of the most important arts,
namely, navigation. But the ciremmstance most worthy of remark is, that there
Should be secrets in such a matter ; that on such a suhject our men of science should
be ignorant of, and unable to discover, that which persons of much less elevated pre-
tensions know and apply ; that the laws which are to be collected either by the
observation of facts, or by the deductions of theory, should not be known to our phi-
losophers by either method, and yet should be in the possession of other persons, to
a considerable extent. This cireumstance makes our knowledge of the tides assnume
the character rather of a mere practical art, than of a portion of that complete and
perfect science of which the other consequences of the law of uniyersal gravitation
supply examples.

Some persons may conceive that, in what has been said, I am disparaging too much
the labours of the great mathematicians, NgEwrox, Bernouiii, Laplack and others,
who have employed their skill on this subject. But this opinion cannot, I conceive,
be maintained with justice. It is well known that all the mathematical solutions of
the problem have confessedly gone upon suppositions very remote from the real facts:
Newrox and BerNnouLL, for instance, have assumed the form of the fluid spheroid,
