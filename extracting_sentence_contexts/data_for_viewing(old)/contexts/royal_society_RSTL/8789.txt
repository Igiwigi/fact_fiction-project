section. In fig. 22 the hypoblast is in section, showing clearly the character of its
cells and their arrangement. In fig. 23 its somewhat irregular outgrowths (hy) are
8een, and their relation to groups of the branched mesoblastic corpuscles,

The most important fact shown by these two drawings is the arrangement of certain
of the mesoblastic branched corpuscles (me) in strings or groups, binding, as it were,
others of the cells into groups. The large cells (z) of these figures are not distinguish-
able in form and character from the epiblastic cells in immediate contact with which
they lie, and from which, with little doubt, they have been derived. They apparently
furnish the primitive elements of the foot; but whether they are to be considered
distinctly as mesoblastic elements or as epiblastic I cannot decide. Supposing that
they give rise to muscular tissue, they establish a yery close connexion between the
« Hautfaserblatt” and the epiblast, which is paralleled in Zydra and in the higher
Caelenterata. On the other hand, it is possible that the strings of branched corpuscles
(derived at an earlier period from the epiblast) which traverse these groups of large
cells are the real foundations of the muscular tissue, and that the large cells serye only
as 80 much material for their appropriation, or as the primitive elements of the nerye-
