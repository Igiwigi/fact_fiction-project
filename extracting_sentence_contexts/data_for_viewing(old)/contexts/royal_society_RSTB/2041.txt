products were stale, the larvae would within certain limits remain practically
unaltered. This was in fact the case. Thus in Exps. 139, 154, and 162, in which
both ova and sperm had been kept respectively twenty-two, twenty-two, and nine
hours before fertilisation, the larvee varied by respectively + 2°0, — 1°8, and — 3-4 per
cent. from those developing from the same sexual products when fresh. The arm
lengths were diminished by respectively 10°3, 5°5, and 1°9 per cent., or somewhat more

than the body-lengths. What at first sight seemed rather curious was the fact that
there was practically no diminution in the proportion of ova reaching the blastula and
pluteus stages, This result is, however, more or less explicable in the light of the
experiments of O. and R. Hertwic, if one may suppose that the conclusions they
drew for eross-fertilisations are more or less true also for direct fertilisations. Thus
they concluded that cross-fertilisation took place most readily when ova of diminished
vitality were mingled with sperm in the best condition possible. Conversely there
would be the least tendency to cross-fertilisation when the ova were in good con-
dition, and the sperm in bad, This was the case in the previously cited series of
experiments, in which not half of the ova were fertilised at all, and only 15 per cent.
of them, instead of 70 per cent., developed to plutei. When both the ova and sperm
are stale, however, we have a condition in which the ova are more ready than usual
to undergo fertilisation, and the spermatozoa less ready than usual to effect it. As
