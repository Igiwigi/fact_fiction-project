* Quarter lethal doses (‘000025 gramme) may be administered every 90 minutes with but slight effect,
and so with 00003, but ‘000035 gramme produces active poisoning, whilst a dose of ‘00004 with the
same interval is soon lethal on repetition.


PHARMACOLOGY OF PSEUDACONITINE AND JAPACONITINE. 91

The bi-hourly administration of japaconitine in about half lethal doses produces
much more urgent symptoms after the third dose than when aconitine is given.

These facts may imply (1) greater toxicity of japaconitine, or (2) slower disap-
pearance of the toxic effect due to individual doses, whether this is due to delayed
elimination or otherwise is not decided ; but as it has been already shown that in a
single initial dose japaconitine is slightly more active, its stronger action on repetition
is probably mainly due to the first cause.
_ 4, There is distinctly less tolerance towards repetition of pseudaconitine given in
the same relationship to the probable lethal, as in the case of the other two aconitines,
This holds equally for quarter lethal doses given at 90 minutes as for third lethal at
90 minutes, and half lethal at 2 hours. In fact, the summation of effect after the
longer interval is peculiarly striking.
