An area of approximately 20 cone units each way was investigated, that is, about
400 in all. At no point in this area was any evidence obtained for the interconnexion of
retinal receptors, as might be indicated by the test source appearing to increase in size, or
by it appearing to remain stationary. Therefore, if in fact dominators composed of three or
more modulators are present in the retina, either they are excluded from the foveal centre
or in some way their presence is masked by some, at present unknown, factor. There is,
however, a further possibility, namely, that dominators do not consist of physiological units
produced by the linking of two red, one green and one blue modulator; but that they are
receptors which, under the action of the antichromatic responses, have been deprived of
colour vision, and are giving what has been called in earlier Parts of this paper, ‘colourless
foveal vision’. This view is substantiated by the experiment described above, in which a
small white test source was caused to move over the surface of the fovea.
