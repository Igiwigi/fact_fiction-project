Josselyn (1935) had already called
attention to the fact that nuclei, other than those of endothelial cells, ‘are so few in number
in most cases that they appear quite incidental’. This aspect is considered in detail in the
next section. Nuclear counts of the alveolar septum of the adult rabbit

In thick sections of the lung where it is possible to study the whole extent of an alveolar
septum, it is a striking fact that the distribution of nuclei is not regular. In material of
which the capillary bed has been injected by weakly coloured carmine-gelatin, and subse-
quently counterstained by haematoxylin, surprisingly large areas are devoid of any nuclei
whatever (see figure 33). Assuming that the capillary bed of the alveolus is invested by endothelial cells, it should
be possible to discover the size of these cells by counting endothelial nuclei in measured
areas of the septum in which the capillary bed has been defined.
