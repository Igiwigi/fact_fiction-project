Segmentation of the yelk
takes place earlier when impregnation is effected by a large, than when occasioned by
a very small number of spermatozoa, the temperature of the surrounding medium, and
all other circumstances, being alike in the two cases, as in the experiments Set A as
compared with Set B (p. 190). "This fact is supported by another, equally significant. When only a very small number of spermatozoa exist in the fluid, then the remarkable
result of partial impregnation often takes place, and the oya are unproductive. On
the other hand, when spermatozoa are supplied in full abundance to the ova, not
only does segmentation of the yelks take place more rapidly, but also more exten-
sively, and almost every ovum produces an embryo.
