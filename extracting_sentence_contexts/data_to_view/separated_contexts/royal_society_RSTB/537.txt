With the great variation according to cireum-
stances, it is of course very difficult to estimate this at all accurately ; but we may
state that two independent modes of estimate lead to the conclusion that, for Great
Britain for example, the average annual loss of nitrogen is more probably under than
over 20 lbs. per acre (= 22Â°4 kilog. per hectare). In fact, the loss by cropping, under
the usual conditions of more or less full periodical return by manure, is by no means
so great as is generally assumed in discussions of this subject. The loss of nitrates by drainage may, however, in some cases be considerable. There may also, under some circumstances, be loss from the soil by the evolution of
free nitrogen.
