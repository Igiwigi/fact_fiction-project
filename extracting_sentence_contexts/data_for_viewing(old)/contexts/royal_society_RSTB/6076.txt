The secondary (adaptive) nature -of these early developmental occurrences in the
blastocyst of the higher Primates was clearly recognised by SeLEN«Ka in his “ Studien”
(Heft 8, pp. 206-8) and in his shorter papers (’000, 01). He instances in particular
the formation of an amnio-embryonal vesicle and the correlated closed method of
amnion-formation, the precocious appearance of the extra-embryonal mesoderm and
coelom, the early vascularisation of the yolk-sac and the replacement of the vesicular
allantois by a connecting stalk. He regarded these happenings as the outcome of the
very early attachment effected by the blastocyst to the uterine lining and concluded
that “ infolge caenogenetischer Anpassungen, sowohl seitens des Embryos wie seitens
der Mutter, ist der Ernihrungsmechanismus der Primatenkeime leistungsfihiger
geworden ” (Heft 8, p. 208), a conclusion which I venture to think is amply substantiated
by the facts and considerations set forth in this lecture.

The material available for the study of the early development of the Pithecoids is
unfortunately by no means extensive. Apart from the four-celled egg of Macacus
nemestrinus described by SELENKA (’03, fig. 1, p. 331), we know nothing of the processes
of cleavage and blastocyst formation in either of the two groups of monkeys. SELENKA,
however, has described and figured in his ‘‘ Studien ’’ (700, 03) three early blastocysts
of Catarrhine monkeys. Of these, the blastocyst of Nasalis larvatus (Keim 8.) is by
far the most important, since it provides us with the earliest Catarrhine embryo so far
known, judging from the condition of its yolk-sac; that of Semnopithecus pruinosus
Lk. is probably just a little older, whilst the third (Keim Ca.) from Macacus cynomolgus
is still more advanced, but like Lk. is of value mainly from the point of view of early
placental development.
