carrying actions, as well as those of wires and electrolytes.

1635. In illustration of the utility and importance of establishing that which may
be the true principle, I will refer to a few cases. The doctrine of unipolarity as
formerly stated, and I think generally understood*, is evidently inconsistent with
my view of a current (1627.); and the later singular phenomena of poles and
flames described by Eran and othersF partake of the same inconsistency of cha-
racter. If a unipolar body could exist, 1. e. one that could conduct the one electricity
and not the other, what yery new characters we should have a right to expect in the
currents of single electricities passing through them, and how greatly ought they to
differ, not only from the common current which is supposed to have both electricities
travelling in opposite directions in equal amount at the same time, but also from each
other! The facts, which are excellent, have, however, gradually been more correctly
explained by BzcquereL}, Anprews 4, and others; and I understand that Professor |
Onns|| has perfected the work, in his close examination of all the phenomena ; and
