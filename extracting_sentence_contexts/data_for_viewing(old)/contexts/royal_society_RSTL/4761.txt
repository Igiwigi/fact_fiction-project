element, with the times of the year at which they should be observed, and the amount

- of parallax, which an observed change of 30' in the angle of position would indicate
in the case of each star.

On the erection of my observatory in the autumn of 1842, comprising among its
instruments an equatoreal of very considerable power, I determined to employ it in
the obseryations of the double stars contained in these lists, with the view of ascer-
taining whether they exhibited such decided differences in their positions, when ob-
Served at the proper periods, as to give good grounds of hope that some definite
conclusion might be arrived at, as to the existence of a parallax in the objects ob-
served, capable of being measured, or at the least, confidently announced as subsist-
ing in fact.

334 LORD WROTTESLEY ON THE PERIODICAL OBSERVATION OF STARS

In conducting the observations, however, difficulties arose that had not been anti-
cipated : Sir Joun Herscners lists contain sixty-nine stars; many of these, at the
periods announced in the lists as proper for observation, if observed at all, must be
