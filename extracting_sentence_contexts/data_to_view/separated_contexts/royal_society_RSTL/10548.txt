Resistance coils of 10 ohms each were used in the two branches
of the bridge, where 100 obms resistances were generally employed.* As it was found
impossible to allow the current to flow for even two or three seconds without unduly
heating the wire, and as VILLART's © shock-currents” would cause the resistance of the
iron to appear greater than it should be when the B.C. was closed, and less than it
should be when the B.C. was opened, the following plan was adopted :—The B.C.
was, at intervals of 30 seconds, closed and immediately afterwards opened ; and in this
way it was found possible to obtain the value of the resistance-ratio of the iron and
platinum 80 nearly, that on moving the sliding-piece to points on the iridio-platinum
wire 20 millims. above or below the supposed balancing-point, a deflection of several
divisions could be obtained in one direction or the other, As the contrary © shock-
currents” produced by closing and immediately opening the B.C. would nob quite
neutralize each other's impulsive effects on the galvanometer-needle, it is obvious
that the effects on the galvanometer, due simply to the fact of the 8liding-piece
being equal distances above or below the true balancing-point, would not produce
equal deflections, but that, by taking the mean of these deflections, the true point
might by easy calculation be determined. As a sample of the mode of experi-
menting we will take the following case : —The true balancing-point seemed to be
55 millims. to the right of the zero of the iridio-platinum wire, and 3 ohms were at
this time in the circuit of the B.C. ; on moving the sliding-piece to 75 a deflection,
on closing and immediately afterwards opening the B.C., of five divisions to the left |
was obtained (a left deflection would here indicate that the sliding-piece should be
moved to the left in order to get the true balance).
