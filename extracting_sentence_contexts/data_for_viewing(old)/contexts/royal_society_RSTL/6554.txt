CONCERNED IN PRODUCING THE GREATER MAGNETIC DISTURBANCES. 629

16. Let us now endeayour to ascertain if any use may be made of this fact to throw
light on the nature of the forces concerned in producing disturbances,

17. Two distinct suppositions may be made regarding the nature and mode of action
of disturbing forces. :

1*. We may suppose that forces of every imaginable variety of character are con-
cerned together in producing disturbances.

2%. We may suppose a disturbance occasioned by one or more groups of forces the
elements of which are bound together by a certain law.

With respect to the first of these hypotheses, it is refuted by the discussion of disturbing
