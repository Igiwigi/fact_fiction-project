R.S. Read November 3, 1801. I: is intended, on the present occasion, to state some facts and
observations, in support of an opinion advanced in a former
lecture, that the adjustment of the eye to see objects at different
distances, does not depend upon any internal changes in the
crystalline lens. The first of the experiments which will be stated, was made
with the assistance of the late Mr. Ramsptn; and, had not
the death of that valuable member of this Society deprived me of
his further aid, the following observations would undoubtedly
have been more deserving the attention of my learned audience.
