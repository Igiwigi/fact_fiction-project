and downwards ; but that the elerical power from
above, and from below, had ſeized upon the gilding,
diflipated part of it in vapour, and by that means be-

but as no concluſion can, with certainty, be drawn
but from facts, confirmed by repeated trials, I de-

riments with him in relation to this matter ; to which
he readily conſented. For that purpoſe I waited
upon him one morning about the middle of June
laſt; and the better to aſcertain what was efſential in
the facts, I varied the circumſtances a little from
thoſe above. In the middle of a paper-book of the thickneſs of

a quire, I puta flip of tin-foil and in another of the
fame thickneſs I put two flips of the ſame fort of foil,
including the two middle leaves of the book between
them. Upon triking the two different books, the
effects were anſwerable to what I expeted, In the
firſt, the leaves on each fide of the foil were pierced,
while the foil itſelf remained unpierced ; but, at the
fame time, I could perceive an impreſſion had been
made on- each of its ſurfaces, at a little diſtance one
from another ; and ſuch impreſſions were ſtill more
viſible upon the paper, and might be traced as point-
ing different ways.
