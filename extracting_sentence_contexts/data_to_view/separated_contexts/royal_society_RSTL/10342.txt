Again, though present conditions avail much in regulating the distribution and com-
parative prevalence of various groups of plants, it is now well recognised that causes
anterior to the existing order of things have determined the existence of larger or
smaller number of the species of each particular family. The alleged antagonisms between plants. —DUrEAU DE LAMALLE* was one of the
first to call attention to the apparent antagonism of certain plants, and to their alter-
nate predominance, the one over the other—a fact frequently observed in the case of
forests, He pointed out that grasses were in his experience the most powerful
enemies of Saintfoin and of Lucerne ; that they overcome them when growing together,
without however being able to destroy them utterly. Moreover, he remarked that
in some islated plateaux never manured or irrigated, he saw, five or six times in the
course of 30 years, grasses and Leguminose lose and regain the prominence one over
the other. Similar phenomena have been observed at Rothamsted, as will be illus-
trated in the sequel.
