The typical example of such correlations is given by the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt
(CHSH) expression with the corresponding classical bound, i.e. the CHSH inequality [25]

(A1B1) + (A1B2) + (A2Bi) — (A2B2) < 2, (3.5)

where A; is a measurement with +1 outcomes, denoted as a;, and similarly for B;, and one defines
(AjBj) = aba] a;bjProb(aj, bj).

In each round of the experiment, a measurement on Alice’s system, say Aj, and a measurement
on Bob’s system, say Bj, are performed (figure 2a). Connecting the Bell scenario with the OP
defined above, one can identify each joint measurement with a context. The assumption of non-
contextuality, then, amounts to the fact that the outcome of Aj; is independent of whether it is
measured together with B, or By, and similarly for B; with respect to Aj, Ag. In the Bell scenario,
the assumption of non-contextuality is justified by the fact that measurements are chosen and
performed in space-like separated space-time regions, hence, they cannot influence each other, as
any ‘disturbance’ from Alice to Bob, or vice versa, would need to travel faster than light.

Elaborating on this idea, non-contextuality inequalities similar to Bell inequalities have been
developed (e.g. [26-30]) and subjected to experimental tests (e.g. [31-33]). These inequalities
involve correlations among measurements for which some property of non-disturbance is
assumed. A typical example is provided by the Klyachko—Can-Binicioglu-Shumovsky (KCBS)
inequality [26]

(AoA1) + (A1A2) + (A2A3) + (A3A4) — (AgA0) <3, (3.6)
