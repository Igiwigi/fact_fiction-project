In like manner,
the blood-corpuscle is seen filled with corpuscles of minuter size ; presenting an ap-
pearance which I can attribute to no other than the same process. This is shown in
the blood-corpuscle of the Fish at y, fig. 52, at « and Þ, fig. 53, and at £ andC, fig. 54
—in that of the Reptile, e, figs. 49 and 50—in that of the Bird, fig. 36 Þ, fig. 41 B,

of Man. (In certain states, the nucleus of the blood-corpuscle is composed of three
or more discs, instead of two. Figs. 33, 34 y,41 þ, 43 3, 45 0,4, 52 y, 3,53 «, 54 £.
