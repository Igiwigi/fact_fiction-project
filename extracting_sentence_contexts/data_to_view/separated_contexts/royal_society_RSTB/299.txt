D. WALLER ON THE ELECTROMOTIVE CHANGES

to the electrometer from leg and mouth. And I may add that I also experimentally
verified the fact that, while potential at mouth agreed with sign of pole at base,
potential at rectum agreed with sign of pole at apex. In the preceding experiments the electrical variations of the heart were observed by
leading off from remote points with the thorax opened, and with the heart therefore
lying in contact with the tissues by its posterior surface only. The next step was to
determine whether the variations can be observed on the intact animal, with the
heart in contact with its normal surroundings.
