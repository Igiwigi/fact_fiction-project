4. (De)oxygenation throughout the last deglaciation

Palaeoclimate records of ocean oxygenation have been used to show how oceanic oxygen levels
have varied in response to past episodes of climate change. This is the case, in particular, for the
last deglaciation, for which Jaccard & Galbraith [17] have revealed a clear de-oxygenation trend
of the upper ocean (and hence an expansion of low-oxygen waters in the Pacific Basin and Indian
Basin) concomitantly with an overall oxygenation of the deeper ocean. Despite the fact that these
past changes were much slower than the current ones, they offer an interesting perspective on
future ocean deoxygenation.

(a) Model-data comparison

Due to the limited number of data points in the reconstruction we use here, we have not
attempted to perform a point-by-point co-localized model-data comparison. In addition, because
the simulated changes in oxygen levels between the LGM and the MH as simulated by IPSL-
CM5A-LR show a certain homogeneity regardless of the longitude, we perform this comparison
ona zonal average basis, as shown in figure 3. Figure 3 shows the zonal-mean changes in oxygen concentrations in the three major ocean
basins from the LGM to the MH, using the two snapshot simulations described in the Material
and methods section.
