Still, converging
evidence from molecular biology, and experimental and epidemiological studies
strongly suggest that shorter TL can directly influence health, particularly by
impairing immune and cardiovascular function [5-8]. In contrast to the tendency for TL to decrease in length with age in most
human tissues, sperm TL shows a positive correlation with age [7,9]. In accord-
ance with the fact that DNA carried in sperm contribute half of each offspring’s
autosomal genome, offspring of older fathers have longer TLs [7,10]. This putative
paternal age at conception (PAC) effect on TL is intriguing because it appears to be
a rare case of intergenerational genetic plasticity in which the DNA passed on to
offspring is systematically changed based upon the age at reproduction of one’s
