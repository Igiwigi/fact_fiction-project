Is the Expansion in Normal Co-ordinates Valid in the General Case ?

16. A remark by Raytetcu* suggests that he had some doubt as to the validity of
the expansion : “ From his (KELvin’s) results it appears that it is not possible to find a
solution applicable to an unlimited fluid which shall be periodic with respect to x, and
remain finite when y= --%,... The cause of the failure would appear to lie in
the fact, indicated by Lord Kutviy’s solution, that the stability is ultimately of a higher
order than can be expressed by any simple exponential function of the time.”

Orr} also considered this question in relation to our problem. He set himself to
establish, (1) that the “ frequency ” equation (from which the 4’s are to be found)
