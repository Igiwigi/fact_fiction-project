Piaidicas remain quite clear cut, and may be sharply located at any points in their
Eoourse, the former marching steadily through the solid jelly towards the cathode, the
Alatter towards the anode, till they meet. It may be mentioned that the blue boundary

is always slightly convex in the direction of its migration, while the yellow boundary
is always slightly concave, so that each presents a meniscus with its convexity towards
the cathode.

At intervals throughout the experiment observations are taken of the positions of
the blue and yellow boundaries, of the time, of the current, and of the voltage ; also of

* The passage of CrO, and Cr,0; ions into the jelly-tube, where they meet with K or other cations,
does not chemically affect the gelatine. In fact, a transparent orange half-normal bichromate-jelly,
containing 12 per cent. of gelatine, may be prepared, solidified, and remelted, without any precipitation of
the gelatine ; but precipitation occurs on the addition of free mineral acid.

the bath temperature, which should keep constant. With constant E.M.F. the
current and the velocities steadily diminish in a manner determined by the nature
and strength of the salt-jelly, but they remain in direct proportion to one another.
The experiment is terminated when the two boundaries meet, which they do at a
