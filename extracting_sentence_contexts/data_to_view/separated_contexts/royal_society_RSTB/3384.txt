And it is probable that in very many groups no such
specialisation occurred in the antipodal cells as is characteristic of the functional egg-
apparatus, Their persistence in the higher Angiosperms is no doubt largely to be
accounted for by the fact that they have acquired a new function and play a more or
less important part in the nutrition of the sac. In the remarkably reduced sae of
Cypripedium an antipodal group is not formed.{ Whether the organisation of anti-
podal cells in the Angiosperms has any connection with a chalazogamous method of
fertilisation is doubtful. The fact that in Welwitschia the generative cell may be
carried down into the tissue of the elongated internode below the origin of the
