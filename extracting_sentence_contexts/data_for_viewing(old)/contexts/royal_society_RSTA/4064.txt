character of the magnetocaloric effect. Outside the magnetostructural transition region, the
magnetocaloric effect is weak and conventional.

In figure 6a, we show the magnetocaloric peak for a given value of the hydrostatic pressure
in more detail. It is interesting to note that the maximum value of the entropy change decreases
as the applied magnetic field is increased. Because the application of the magnetic field shifts
the magnetostructural transition to lower temperatures, the observed behaviour is consistent
with the previously discussed decrease in the transition entropy with the difference between the
Curie and structural transitions. In figure 6, we show the corresponding structural and magnetic
contributions to the whole magnetocaloric peak. In agreement with reported experimental
studies [43], the present results also indicate that the magnetocaloric effect in the vicinity of
the magnetostructural transition is dominated by the structural contribution to the entropy. In
any case, note that, despite the fact that the magnetostructural transition can be induced by
application of pressure, there is no volume contribution to the entropy change.
