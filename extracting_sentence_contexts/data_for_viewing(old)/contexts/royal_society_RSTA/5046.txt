Next, Maxwell goes on to show that the refractive index of a non-conducting material n is
given by the square root of the specific inductive capacity of the medium. He writes

k= Fko and ko =4rV5 ... Hence

p=", (5.9)
a
or the Specific Inductive Capacity is equal to the square of the index of refraction divided
by the coefficient of magnetic induction.

Maxwell then makes a preliminary exploration of the case of anisotropic crystalline materials.
He was well aware of the fact that crystals could have different refractive indices along different
axes and so studies the case in which ju takes different values along the x, y,z directions.

The next application is the relation between electrical resistance and the transparency of
materials. The objective was to account for the fact that, as he put it, ‘Most transparent solid
bodies are good insulators, whereas all good conductors are very opaque.’ He investigates the
propagation of light along the x-axis of the transverse disturbance Ay. Including the resistivity 9
of the medium, the propagation equation becomes
