then capable of an independent development. The strong resemblance” however
between true Medus&® and the medusoids produced by a process of gemmation from
polypes does not afford sufficient grounds for maintaining that all Medusw are only
advanced stages of tubularian zoophytes and of Campanularice, or that all these
zoophytes are only earlier phases in the development of Meduse; and M. DuaarviNn's
generalization, from which would result the complete abolition of the Campanularie
and tubularian zoophytes as distinct groups of the animal kingdom, is certainly
destitute of sufficient foundation, while the bodies contained in the fixed sacs are
undoubtedly not gemm@ but ova, as their structure and the whole history of their
development must render evident. I cannot think, then, that either Vax BENEDEN
or Dvaarvin has succeeded in overthrowing the theory of EHRENBERG.

The conelusion to which the facts s0nght to be demonstrated in the present paper
would seem to lead, is that in the tubularian zoopbytes there exist three Kinds of
zooids, all produced by a process of gemmation from an original stolon, which is itself
the immediate product of a true ovum. 'These are,—1. the ordinary terminal
