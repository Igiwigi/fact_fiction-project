Two minutes after immersion even these partial
contractions entirely ceased, and s00n afterwards all parts of the animal were completely
dead to stimulation. Recovery in normal water slower than that after chloroform,
but still 800n quite complete. Repeated experiment on this individual four times with-
out injury.‚Äù

(c) The species I shall choose for describing the effects of strychnia is Cyancea capil-
lata, which is most admirably adapted for experiments with this and some of the other
alkaloid poisons, from the fact that, in water kept at a constant temperature, its pulsa-
tions are as regular as are those of a heart. After Cyan capillata has been allowed
to oak for ten minutes or 80 in a weak sea-water solution of strychnia, unmistakable
signs of irregularity in the pulsations 8uperyene. This irregularity then increases more
and more, till at length it grows into well-marked conyulsions. 'The convulsions
manifest themselyes in the form of extreme deviations from the rhythmical contractions
