41. When, by keeping india-rubber at rest at a low temperature for 80me time, it has

become rigid, it ceases to be heated when stretched by a weight, and, on the contrary, a
cooling effect takes place as in the metals and gutta percha. The experiment by which
I ascertained this fact was made with a piece of india-rubber + of an inch square, which
had been exposed for several days to a temperature not lower than 5* Cent. In this
state it was found that the application of a tensile force of 14 Ibs. produced a deflection
of 20/, indicating cold, and that a contrary deflection, indicating heat, was produced by
removing the weight. After raising the temperature of the rubber to 159, the elasticity
of the rubber was restored, and the reverse phenomenon of heat on stretching produced,
indicated by a deflection of 15',
