The second triplet
gives 2°92 for the separation of the second satellite from the first and 2°06 for the
separation of the satellite of the second line of the triplet, and from analogy with
other satellite series, this would be the separation of the first and second satellites of
the first line. Differences of 33 and 26 give separations of 3°06 and 2°04, so that it
may be concluded that the satellites depend on these differences, a conclusion
supported by the fact that a similar result is indicated as possible for Ca. Returning to the curious fact noticed above that the first triplets of the series
seem to be dislocated, the second fragment in Sr is found at a distance 143°68 below
its normal position. For the present we note this can be explained by one of two
possible collateral displacements, viz. (—18}) F (2) or F (2) (34,), where F stands for
the normal F, or F;. The case of Ba below will give evidence in favour of the latter
explanation.
