We
Lukas Kratochvil agreed that a large revision, based mostly on empirical results in a group of ani-

would be great to illuminate the research field, and to see where it has moved
during the more than 100 years since the pioneering steps of the paradigm on
sex chromosome evolution [1]. You may guess that we were and still are con-
vinced that vertebrates are the most suitable group (we say so with great
respect for other organisms) to address these questions. This choice reflected
our own research interests and the fact that vertebrates are popular for empiri-
cal research, allowing us to dive much deeper into several aspects—such as
gene ontology and molecular pathways—than in less well-examined groups. Of course, this also considers our own taxonomic classification, and naturally,
we are interested in the evolution of our phylogenetic past, although—at
the same time—such an anthropocentric view results in some obvious
scientific limitations. Our initial idea started to ‘materialize’ during a first meeting on sex chromo-
some evolution in vertebrates, organized by us and hosted by the Faculty of
Science of the Charles University in Prague in 2018, when a group of vertebrate
sex-determination enthusiasts discussed sex chromosome evolution and ident-
ified the most controversial and vivid topics, not only for discussion in the
classroom, but also amongst ourselves during the observation of voracious
feeding of Komodo dragons and giant salamanders in the Prague Zoo.
