NATALITY DERIVED FROM HIS OBSERVATIONS AT BUDAPEST. 809

tial natality—which we may regard as approaching as near as possible to the
physiological—becomes continually greater, and the effect of moral restraint (combined
ys with the effects of exhaustion) assumes dimensions surpassing all imagination.
With mothers between 30 and 35 this moral restraint reduces the fecundity from 100
to 78, with such between 35 and 40 yeurs to 45 per cent., that is, the depression
‘amounts to more than half. But at ages over 40 years, the natural fertility of wives
is almost entirely suppressed by these factors. For the first moment one may perhaps
doubt the reliability of the statistical fact, that whilst out of 100 new-married
women at the age 40-45, there are still 29 who will have a child during a year, we
find amongst 100 who married earlier, only 6; or that at the age 45-50, while the
physiological probability is still of 260 births for 1000 women, the probability as
shown by the Tables is actually only 7! But if we take into account with how much
anxiety wives at this age—at which they often become grandmothers—regard the
event of childbirth, we may look upon the above statement as trustworthy.
The moral restraint exercises its influence also on the natality of the fathers, though
the effect of it is weaker than in the case of mothers. At the age of 35-40 we find
against the physiological natality of 100 an actual of 73, and at the age 40-45 a
natality of 50 per cent.
