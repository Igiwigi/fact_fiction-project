be conceived to grow by apposition of layers added from the inside or outside, although
i s Juminated structure might at first be supposed to afford some support to this view ;
E the increase in number, as the growth proceeds, of the buttons placed on the outer
zurface, and their early appearance, make it impossible to understand growth by either of
these modes. It is, I think, certain that it grows interstitially, and the suggestion arises
that the larger stellar dots may in some hed be connected with this increase. The fact that young ovarian ova, of ;4g” in diameter, when the dots are first measured
how them to average about 24,000 to an inch linear, and ripe eggs five or six times
their diameter have 11,000 dots to an inch, thus but little more than doubling their size
gr distance apart, proves that during growth the number of these structural elements
T the yelk-sac must increase, as well as their size. This may be taken as an additional
of of interstitial growth. S There is no evidence of the conversion of the substance of the outer layer of the pro-
lasm, 7. e. the cortex of the yelk, into yelk-sac, in the sense in which that gradual
@nversion is believed by Dr.
