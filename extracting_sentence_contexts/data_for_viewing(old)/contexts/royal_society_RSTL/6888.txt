diment in space, and no sun existing sufficiently powerful to make good the loss. T
believe the fact is well established that the desert of Sahara, which during the day is
burning hot, is often extremely cold at night. This effect has been hitherto referred in
a general way to the © purity of the air;” but purity, as judged by the eye, is a yery
imperfect test of radiation, for the existence of large quantities of vapour is consistent
with a transparent atmosphere. The purity really consists im the absence of aqueous
vapour from those s0-called rainless districts, which, when the sun is withdrawn, enables
the hot surface of the earth to run speedily down to a freezing temperature.

On the most serene days the atmosphere may be charged with vapour ; in the Alps,
for example, it often happens that skies of extraordinary clearness are the harbingers of
rain. On snch days, no matter how pure the air may seem to the eye, terrestrial radia-
tion is arrested. And here we have the simple explanation of an interesting fact noticed


OF RADIANT HEAT TO AQUEOUS VAPOUR. , i

by Sir Jonx LesLt, which has remained without explanation up to the present time.
This eminent experimenter devised a modification of his differential thermometer,
which he called an Zhrioscope. The instrument consisted of two bulbs united by a
vertical tube, of a bore small enough to retain a little liquid index by its own adhesion.
The lower bulb was protected by a metallic coating ; the upper or sentient bulb was
blackened, and was placed m the concavity of a polished metal cup, which protected
it completely from terrestrial radiation. * This instrument,” says its inyentor, © will at
all times during the day and night indicate an impression of cold shot downwards from
