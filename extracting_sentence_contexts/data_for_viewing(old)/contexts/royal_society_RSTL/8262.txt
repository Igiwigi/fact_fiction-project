Z aluminium wire.
Feing selected as being a good-conductor and giving a very simple and easily recognized
Spectrum.
BZ Chlorides observed. Lithic Chloride, Li Cl.—The wave-lengths of the longest lines of
Jhis metal are as follows :—6705:2, 6102-0, and 4602-7, the latter (in the blue) being a
ide and winged line. When the spectrum of the chloride is observed, the red line
7052 is seen right across the spectrum, the orange, 61020, is faintly visible for about
Ralf the distance ; 4602-7 has yanished altogether. In the case of lithium this extinc-
tion can be carried further in the flame reaction with an ordinary Bunsen burner, in
which the red line 6705-2 is alone seen®.

5889-0
Sodium spectrum ; it is, in fact, the longest metallic line I have observed. After D

Sodic Chloride, Na CL—The D line SINGD is by very far the longest line in the

* Tt is necessary in dealing with Li Cl and Na Cl to have the poles rather far apart (8 to 10 millims.), as, on
account of the easy yolatility of these chlorides, if the poles are close all the lines appear stretching across the
spectrum.
