standard deviation we ought to subtract 743th of the square of the base element of
grouping, but that the mean and product of the grouped deviations should be left
uncorrected. Thus corrected the values of the constants of the distribution as found
from the ungrouped and grouped deviations will nearly, but not of course absolutely,
coincide. In particular while the personal equation relation

Pa = Po — Pa

will be absolutely satisfied for the ungrouped material, it will generally not be
satisfied exactly for the grouped results. A test, however, of the practical justifica-
tion for grouping is that the divergencies between the two methods ought to be of
the order of the probable errors of the results. If this be so, then we may safely
group. The fact that my grouped observations did not satisfy the relation cited
above, led me to think it worth while that a comparison should at any rate be once
made between ungrouped and grouped results on a large series of actual errors of
observation. At the same time it gave me a means of verifying the accuracy of our
very long arithmetical reductions by an independent investigation. The ungrouped
observations were dealt with in the case of nine series involving 500 or 519 observa-
tions each. The labour of squaring so many individual deviations each read to four
figures was lessened by using Bartow’s Tables, and the series were added up by aid
of an American Comptometer, which for some years past we have found of great aid
in statistical investigations,
