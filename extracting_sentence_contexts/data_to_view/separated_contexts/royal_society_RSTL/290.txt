I throw out these hints for discussion, rather than with any
wish for their adoption, and for the purpose of directing the
attention of chemists towards the subject of nomenclature,
which ought to be settled on some fixed principles; and in
naming a new class of compounds, great caution should be
used to prevent the necessity of alteration, In my last paper, presented to the Society two months ago,
I ventured to suggest that it was probable, that new species
of matter, which act with respect to inflammable bodies, like
oxygen, chlorine, and fluorine, would be discovered, I had
not hoped, at that time, to be able 80 s0on to describe the' pro-
perties of a body of this kind, which forms an acid with hy-
drogen, like chlorine and fluorine, and which in some of its
combinations resembles oxygen. This new fact will, I hope, do something towards settling
the opinion of chemists respecting the nature of acidity, which
seems to depend upon peculiar combinations of matter, and
not on any peculiar elementary principle. It is probable that /odine will be found in many combinations
in nature. We may expect that it will be discovered in vari-
ous marine vegetables, and in sea water, and probably the loss
of weight indicated in the analysis of certain fossil substances
may depend upon its expulsion.
