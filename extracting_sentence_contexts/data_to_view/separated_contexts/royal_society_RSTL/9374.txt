In umbrellas with their lithocysts removed
these tentacular waves course all the way round the margin without exciting any
visible contraction in the umbrella-tissue which was the immediate seat of stimulation.;
but if any of the lithocysts are left un $tu, they invariably discharge their ganglionic
influence shortly after a tentacular wave reaches them. These facts, of course, tend to show that in the excitable tissues of Aurelia there
is 8ome element which performs the essential function of nerve—the function, namely,
of conveying stimuli irrespective of the passage of contractile waves. But in view
of the fact that in these same tissues contractile waves may occur of 80 feeble an
intensity as to be almost invisible, it becomes necessary to be quite sure that such
waves may not sometimes be 80 feeble as to be quite invisible, and therefore that what
IT have called nervous waves of stimulation are not in reality only invisible muscular
waves of contraction. The evidence which I have to adduce in order to show that
such is nob the case is happily unequivocal. I cannot, indeed, prove that muscular
waves of contraction may not occur in the excitable tissues of Aurelia of too feeble an
intensity to admit of becoming visible ; but I am able to prove that, whether or not
such is the case, other waves of a distinctively nervous kind undoubtedly pass through
these tissues.
