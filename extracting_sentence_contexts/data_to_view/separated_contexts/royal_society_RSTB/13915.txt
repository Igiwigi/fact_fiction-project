Addressee facial ‘displays’ can also serve the
grounding process, such as wincing in response to someone
describing a painful experience, or a facial expressions of con-
cern or fear in response to elements of close call stories
[130,131]. Such ‘specific listener responses’ [131] signal under-
standing of the message (as well as empathy), and possibly
more unambiguously so than ‘generic listener responses’ (e.g.
‘mhm’, nods). While gaze may not function as a grounding signal in
itself, the significance of visual signals for grounding is
underlined by the fact that speakers actively elicit them by
looking at the addressee, thus creating brief time windows
of mutual gaze during which the addressee responses occur
[131]. Thus, manual gestures, head movements and facial sig-
nals play an important role in the process of grounding, a sine
qua non in conversational interaction [19].

responding to repair initiations

Despite being able to draw upon mechanisms for grounding
that are beneficial for achieving mutual understanding in con-
versation, troubles in understanding are common [132]. Causes
include trouble in hearing and in grasping the actual content of
an utterance.
