paper on the cestrous cycle, which experience cestrus only once annually or, as in
some cases, even less often, for it can hardly be supposed that these animals ovulate
at more frequent periods than those at which they come “on heat.”* But Bearp
denies that there is any correspondence between “the heat period or rut of
mammals” and menstruation in the higher forms, failing to distinguish the
procestrum from the period of cestrus, a distinction which was first pointed out by
Hearse (1900). It should be added that Bearn’s views on menstruation form a part
of his general theory of reproduction which he regards as a process maintaining
normally a perfectly regular rhythm.

The theory that the whole procestrous process, including the degeneration and
recuperation stage, is of the nature of a preparation for an embryo, does not appear
to us to be opposed to any of the known facts. According to this theory “ the
process is viewed as a kind of surgical ‘freshening’ of the uterus for the
reception of the ovum, whereby the latter during the healing process can be
attached safely to the uterine wall” (Grpprs and Tuomson, 1901). This

He points out that this secretion is still produced, even though the egg is prevented from entering the
oviduct. Rerrerer, therefore, apparently regards ovulation as occurring during the early stages of the
procestrum, a conclusion which we have shown to be erroneous, but his only statement on this point is that
it occurs during “heat.” He seems also to assume that ovulation is the cause of menstruation in the
human female.
