the isthmus. And if the interval be still further reduced to one second, or half a
second, comparatively few of the waves will pass across. Now, however, if the tiszue
be allowed five minutes' resb from stimulation, and the single shocks be thrown in
at one second's intervals, all the first six or ten waves will-pass across the isthmus,
after which they begin to become blocked as before. It may be observed also that,
when the waves are thus blocked, owing to exhanstion of the connecting isthmus,
they may again be made to force a passage by increasing the intensity of the stimu-
lation, and 80 giving rise to stronger waves having a greater power of penetration.
Thus, on re-enforcing the electrical stimulus with the simultaneous application of a
drop of spirit, the resulting waves of contraction are almost sure to pass across the
isthmus, even though this has been exhausted in the manner just described.

$ 3.—Another fact, which I have several times observed during my sections of Aurelia,
also deserves to be recorded. TI have observed it under several modes of section, but
it will be only necessary to describe one observation.

In the Aurelia, of a portion of which the accompanying woodeut 1s a representation,
8even of the lithocysts were removed, while the remaining one was almosb entirely
isolated from the general contractile tissue by the incisions aa, bb, cc. The lithocyst
continued to animate the tissue area wa a w-, and through the connecting passage /
the contractile waves spread over the remainder of the subumbrella tiggue 2222.
80 far, of course, the facts were normal ; but very frequently it was observed that
the contractile waves did not start from the lithocyst, or from the area © za, but
