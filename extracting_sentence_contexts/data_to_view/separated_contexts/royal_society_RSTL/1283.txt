It is one of the most important subjects to which Mr. Davy's
discoveries can be applied, and he has given it the considera-
tion it deserves. The VorTaic battery is met with in the torpedo and-elec-
trical eel, and although iis given oaly as a means of catching
their prey, and defending themselves, and therefore not im-
mediately applicable to the present inquiry, yet it furnishes
two important facts, one, that a VoLTA1c battery can be formed
in a living animal, the other, that nerves are essentially ne-
cessary for its management; for in these fish, the nerves
connected with the electrical organs, exceed those that go
to all the other parts of the fish, in the proportion of twenty
to one. The nerves are made up. of an infinite number of
small fibres, a structure so different from that of the electric
organ, that they are evidently not fitted to form a VoLTArc
battery of high power ; but their structure appears to Mr. Davy to adapt them to receive and preserve a small electrical
power.

"That the nerves arranged with muscles, s0 as to form a
VoLTaio battery, have a power of accumulating and commu-

nicating electricity; is' proved -by the well known experiment
of taking the two hind legs of a-vivaceous frog, immediately
after they are cut off, laying bare the-crural nerves, applying
one of these to the exposed' muscles- of the other limb, and
then when the circle is/completed by raising.the/other crural
nerve with a-glass'rod, and touching the muscle of the limb to
which it does not belong, the muscles of both are excited to
contractions. i

There re several [circumstances in the. structure of the
nerves, and‚Äù their arrangements in animal | bodies, which do
not appear at'all applicable to. the purposes of common sen-
sation, and whose uses' have not even been devised.
