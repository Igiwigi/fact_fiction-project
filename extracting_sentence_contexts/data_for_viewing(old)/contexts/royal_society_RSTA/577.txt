constructed in the aftermath of the 26 May 1983 tsunami. They were overtopped at places by an
11m tsunami flood [25]. Shuto & Fujima [25] stated that ‘This fact called for serious reflection to
the conventional method after 1960 that relied mainly on structures’. The event generated a high-
quality inundation dataset in a geographical setting where a fairly accurate determination of the
seafloor motion could be made post facto. The latter is important because tsunami predictions can
only be as good as the estimates of the source characteristics that produced them, i.e. the estimates
of the initial condition for the hydrodynamic simulations. This Okushiri tsunami became the
most useful benchmark for numerical codes that purport to predict tsunami inundation. In its
aftermath, Japan spent over US$600M (in 1998) to build an 11 m high seawall, to rebuild the main
town of Aonae, and to protect about 20 km of coastlines. Even so, its population dwindled from
4679 in 1993 to 3160 in 2012 [26].

The fact that Japan spent an average of approximately US$130K per Okushiri resident
expressed a commitment to tsunami hazard mitigation, which unfortunately the 11 March 2011
underscored as not having been uniformly applied elsewhere. To wit, we are reminded of the
Kamaishi breakwater, a pharaonic structure protecting Kamaishi, where no NPPs are located.
Built at a cost of nearly US$1.5B, after more than three decades in construction, it was the largest
and deepest breakwater in the world, and was located 215 km from Fukushima Dai-ichi (figure 1)
and largely crumpled under the tsunami [27].

3. Abrief history of two nuclear power plants

Four NPPs were affected by the 11 March 2011 tsunami, the Onagawa, Fukushima Dai-ichi,
Fukushima Dai-ni and Tokai Dai-ni NPPs [28,29], all within approximately 230km stretch of
coastline (figure 1). The Higashidori NPP was also affected, but primarily because of loss of
