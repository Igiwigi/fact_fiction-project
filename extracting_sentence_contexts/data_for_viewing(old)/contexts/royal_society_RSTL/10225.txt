cartilage, the vertebral constrictions are subsequently replaced by intervertebral con-
strictions, yeb ab the same time the primitive occurrence of vertebral constrictions
demonstrates that the vertebral column of Lepidosteus is a modification of a type of
vertebral column with biconcave vertebra.
The structure of the gelatinous body of the notochord has undergone no important

in the vertebral regions, the sheath is much thicker (014 millim.) than in the in
vertebral (005 millim.), and a careful examination of the sheath in longitudinal i
shows that the thickening is due to the special differentiation of a superficial
(Plate 28, fig. 69, $h.) of the sheath in each vertebral region. This part is 80mew
granular as compared to the remainder, especially in longitudinal sections. It fi
a cylinder (the wall of which is about '01 millim. thick) in each vertebral region, i

of the notochord within there is a very thin unmodified portion of the sheath, which

is faintly, but at the same time distinetly, concentrically striated—a probable indicati T
of concentric fibres. The inner unmodified layer of the sheath bas the appearance in
transyerse sections through the vertebral regions of an inner membrane, and may:
