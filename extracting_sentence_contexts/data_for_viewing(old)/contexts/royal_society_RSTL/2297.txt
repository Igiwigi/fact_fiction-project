minute; the forty plates evolved 4:6 cubic inches in the same time ; the whole then
evolved 1 cubic inch in the half minute; the ten weakly charged evolved 0:4 of a
cubic inch in the time given: and finally the whole evolved 1-15 cubic inch in the
standard time. The order of the obseryations was that given : the results sufficiently
show the extremely injurious effect produced by the mixture of strong and weak
charges in the same battery®,

1045. In the same manner associations of s/rong and weak pairs of plates should
be carefully avoided. A pair of copper and platina plates arranged in accordance
with a pair of zinc and platina plates in dilute sulphuric acid, were found to stop the
action of the latter, or even of two pairs of the latter, as effectually almost as an in-
terposed plate of platina (1011.), or as if the copper itself had been platina. It, in
fact, became an interposed decomposing plate, and therefore a retarding instead of
an assisting pair.

1046. The reversal, by accident or otherwise, of the plates in a battery has an ex-
ceedingly injurious effect. It is not merely the counter action of the current which the
reversed plates can produce, but their effect also in retarding even as indifferent plates,
and requiring decomposition to be effected upon their surface, in accordance with the
course of the current, before the latter can pass. They oppose the current, therefore,
in the first place, as platina interposed plates would do (1011—1018.); and to this
they add a force of opposition as counter-voltaic plates. I find that, in a series of
four pair of zinc and platina plates in dilute suIphuric acid, if one pair be reversed, it
very nearly neutralizes the power of the whole.
