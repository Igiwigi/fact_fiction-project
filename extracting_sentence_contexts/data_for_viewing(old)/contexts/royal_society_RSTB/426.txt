196 DR. F. SEMON AND MR. V. HORSLEY ON AN INVESTIGATION

This combination of physiological relationship in the larynx has not, so far as we
know, received much attention, we wish, therefore, to lay stress upon the fact that,
until it has been further investigated, we shall not speak dogmatically upon the
relative degree of representation of the two antagonistic movements in any one point
of the cortex, but shall content ourselves with giving the results of our work. The
further consideration naturally arises, that possibly what applies to the peripheral
mechanism may also be true of the central apparatus, that, in short, the activity of
the cortical corpuscles in which the representation of adduction exists may be more
easily extinguished by ether than that of the representation of abduction. Con-
sidering, too, that this implies the earlier abolition of purposive function, it is not so
fallacious to thus translate peripheral (7.¢., nerve ending ?) conditions toacentre. This,
however, although a question of the utmost interest, does not appear to be capable of
direct solution until it is possible to differentiate either anatomically or functionally the
particular fibres in the pyramidal tracts in which closure or opening are respectively
