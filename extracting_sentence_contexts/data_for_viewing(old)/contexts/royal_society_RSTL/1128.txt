I shall now proceed to select from the great mass of facts
that are exhibited on the face of Bengore promontory, and
occur in the contiguous basaltic country, such as seem appli-

such subjects.

Facts applicable to geological Questions.

1, Every stratum preserves accurately, or very nearly, the
same thickness through its whole extent, with very few ex-
ceptions.

2, The upper and lower surface of each stratum preserve
