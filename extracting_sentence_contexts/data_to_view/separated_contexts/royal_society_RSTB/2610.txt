The type of structure in Group (2) of Kocx is based upon the spheroid and

ellipsoid seen in transverse sections of certain Madreporarians, and in embryonic

several important figures, but in as great confusion as ever regarding the ultimate
structural unit in Madreporaria. It is almost a relief to return to the sclerenchymatous
nodule of Epwarps and Haims. For what is this spheroid?
