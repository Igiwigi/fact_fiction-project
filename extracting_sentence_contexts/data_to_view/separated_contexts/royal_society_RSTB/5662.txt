In
many of the experiments, however, the displacements could not be estimated at all,
because the lateral bundle of the leaf with which the second primordium made contact
had been disturbed by the cut. The displacement of the second primordium was
always towards the wound, and was nearly always greater after isolation of I, than of Py. It must have contributed towards the increase in the divergence angle between the
first and second primordia, and the fact that it was greater after isolation of I, must have
