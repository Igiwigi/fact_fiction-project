former. The inner cortex of the rootlets of Lyginodendron has also less definite
lacunz than that of the rootlets of Calamites, a distinction which, however, becomes —
of doubtful value in the case of the very finest rootlets.

The rootlets of Rhizonium differ from those of Lyginodendron in the entire structure —
of the cortex, which is formed throughout of uniform closely-fitting cells, with few
secretory sacs. Jthizoniumt is also characterized by its extraordinarily abundant
branching, much exceeding that even of the roots of Lyginodendron. In some even
of the small rootlets, the identification is quite satisfactory. Thus triarch rootlets,
with the characteristic structure of the Lyginodendron root, are found, as to the true
nature of which there can be no doubt.}

When Memoir XIII. was* published, the fact that these finer branches were —
rootlets was already recognized as probable, though Kalowylon was at that time —
regarded as an independent plant. The doubt suggested in that memoir as to the —
centripetal development of the xylem disappears as soon as we realize that the
rootlets of different sizes are not developmental stages of the same organ, bub —
represent branches of different orders or simply of different dimensions.

The typical roots of Lyginodendron, before the commencement of secondary growth,
often bear a striking resemblance to the smaller roots of recent Marattiacew. On
the other hand, they have little in common with those of any Cycadew at present
investigated.
