accounted for by the sensitiveness of the fern in the matter of sori to very slight
differences of environment. I look upon the high resemblance of like parts here as
having been intensified by this cause ; upon an inherent individuality we have super-

Sposed an individuality due partially, perhaps, to age, but largely to small differences
“of immediate environment. Although the variation in the race is so large, and the
giegree of individuality so great, the ratio of individual to racial variability is still
278 per cent. Thus while the variability of the hartstongue (as far as sori is concerned)
ais double that of the very variable holly, and almost thrice that of the poppy, still
“the percentage variability of the two latter species is to that of the former only as
Sabout 85 to 78. Thus in the most variable and most individual species we have yet
Bome across, we still find the variation within the individual is more than three-fourths
obf the entire variation of the race. In view of facts like this, it seems impossible to
‘Smaintain the position taken up by Mr. ApAM Sepewick, that variation is the outcome
Sof bi-sexual reproduction. The source of variation exists within the individual and
Sis extensively active without the occurrence of any form of mating whatever.

3r place here the table for the distribution of sor in pairs of fronds. The numbers
Zin brackets are those which must replace the unbracketed numbers, if fronds without
Byori be excluded.
