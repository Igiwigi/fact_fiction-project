44144 is not visible on I. is readily interpreted, for on this photograph, the true
photographic intensity of \6678 is 6°25, so that 14144 would become invisible if its
intensity on the arbitrary scale of the last table were less than 16, which it may
readily be, by comparison with the remainder of the last table.

After this initial drop, a remarkable enhancement takes place in 14388, which is
not confined to the last three photographs, and which cannot therefore be interpreted
as due to a difference in behaviour of the separate plate on which they were taken.
The change is of a quite different order of magnitude from any change found in
Table V.

On the apparent law followed by the rest of the table, the true intensity of \4144
on IV. is found to be 1°2, which is in accordance with the fact that it is just visible.
The intensities of this line on later photographs, even on the supposition of quite
considerable enhancement after the manner of 4388, are all less than unity, so that
its disappearance is to be expected. The theoretical intensity of \4922 on VII., on
the same supposition, cannot exceed about 0°9 on the true scale, which is in accordance
with its disappearance from this photograph. It is therefore true in general that
the absence of lines in this series on the various photographs presents no disturbing
feature.

The general conclusion regarding the Diffuse series of Parhelium is that, after an
initial tendency to enhancement of the first member \6678 at the expense of the
others, taking place almost exactly at the extremity of the dark space, there is a
subsequent transfer of energy of the series to the higher members, as the distance
