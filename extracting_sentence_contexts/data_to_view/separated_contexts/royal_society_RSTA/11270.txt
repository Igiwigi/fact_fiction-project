Ranon* for the details of all the individuals
that are classed under this heading. I presume that in measuring the tibia he has

the maximum length. Unfortunately we have only five cases to base our estimate
upon. Neanderthal Man.

g Ranon gives 161°3 centims. (but I think he ought to have given 165:2 centims.,
gs his femur estimate is incorrect) and ScHAAFFHAUSENt 160°1 centims., so that our
