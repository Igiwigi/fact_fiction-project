(e) Beyond post-processing and toward decision-making

In addition to the use of AI for post-processing individual weather models, there is an
opportunity, and perhaps a need, to use Al as an ‘algorithmic interface’ to weather model output.
As ever more weather models come online, each with increasingly high resolution and with more
numerous ensemble members, meteorologists are increasingly stretched to reliably and accurately
summarize the available information into meaningful forecasts for end-users. While this is less
of an issue in day-to-day forecasting (where, for example, reporting a simple ensemble mean—
human out of the loop—may be sufficient) it becomes much more significant in the context of
hazard warnings, where probabilistic forecasts need to be well-calibrated in order to be effective.

In fact, there exists a gap between the information output by NWP models (a set of predictions
of weather outcomes, each likely to be carrying biases) and the information required to make
optimal decisions (which, according to decision theory, would be a well-calibrated probability
distribution over weather outcomes). While the outputs of traditional NWP modelling could be
viewed as a sparse approximation of the desired probability distribution over outcomes, the use of
AI to debias and ‘infill’ this probability distribution based on all available information seems an


important area for AI post-processing. The development of such systems, which can optimally
extract and present information from the range of models they oversee, has the potential to
not only improve on probabilistic forecasting when it matters most but also facilitate individual
model development by providing overarching consistency in output, so that drastically changing
an individual model will not break the system (the overall output will be carried by the other
