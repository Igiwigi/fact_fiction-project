is interesting in the Weekes paper that Vassili Vorontsov observed :
nanometre-scale twinning within hydrides that had been deformed, ia
which of course would give a texture change â€” and small texture tw
changes are in fact observed. 1m

Question 6 : &

Mike Finis Ijust wanted to ask if you could discover anything about the correction
to the phase diagram through this work?

Ben Britton There is a gap between the dissolution and precipitation of the hydrides
[?], and that is related to the strain field. And so some of this will have an
influence on this phenomenon, which is related to how the hydrides are
evolving. And that gap is really important in terms of creep and hydride
cracking as well as a few other bits and pieces. So there is a significant
gap between those two: the dissolution and the precipitation.
