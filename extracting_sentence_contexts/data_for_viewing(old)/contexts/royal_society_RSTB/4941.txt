So, too, are the effects upon hatching of changing the humidity, but in this case the
agreement is Jess striking. While KrrxparricK finds that a rise of humidity from
12-2 mm. to 21-1 mm. raises the hatching percentage from 59 to 69, the same change
in the present experiments only raised it from 72 to 76, or less than half as much
(Curve IT, circles).

Tn comparing these two results there is first the fact that the number of eggs incubated
by KirKparrick per point on his curve is about three times the number per point of
the present experiments. This, of course, gives considerable weight to his result. On
the other hand, in his method of supplying moisture it was not only the humidity that
altered, The air flow varied and with it probably the temperature gradient, so that the
influence of other conditions was not so completely eliminated as in the method of two
incubators here described. ‘There was also the fact that values of the humidity obtained
by the use of the diffusion hygrometer were the true mean values during the 24 hours.
When these considerations are allowed for, the apparent advantage of the larger number
of eggs comes near to vanishing, if it does not actually reverse.

Be this as it may, the writer ventures to think that the agreement found between the
results of experiments on such different lines is sufficiently close to put these results

beyond any reasonable doubt, and to settle the problem of moisture so far as the practical
incubation of hens’ eggs is concerned. It seems clear that too much weight has been
