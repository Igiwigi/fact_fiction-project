It is unnecessary to illustrate the genesis of the remaining formule. The
combinations used are summarised in the following table and the actual formule are
given in Table XIV :—

The formule for the functions Y are exactly the same as those for the corresponding
functions X, save that they start with different values of H. he differences in phase
between the results of X, Y for a solar constituent S have been made approximately
90°, and the initial values of H have been chosen so that odd, as well as even, values
of H are used in one or other of the functions X,, Y,. The reason for using negative values of H in X; is to simplify the operations required
in the analysis of short lengths of records, especially in connexion with the correction
of M, on account of O,.

‘The formula for X; is rather complicated, due to the difficulty of adequately diminishing
contributions from diurnal constituents, but the extra labour is ofiset by the fact that
in practice there is no need for Y, to be evaluated, as there is no constituent 5, of any
importance. There is complete elimination of all unwanted solar constituents and the following
table illustrates the degree of reduction of important constituents in each species. Signs are here ignored in the values of J.
