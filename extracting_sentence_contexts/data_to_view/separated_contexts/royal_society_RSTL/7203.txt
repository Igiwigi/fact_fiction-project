NEUMANN has taken into account that the
immersed body, when the water shows its maximum temperature, may have a somewhat,
higher temperature *. AyoGapRo has also taken this into accountf, and REGNAULT has
also allowed for this circumstance in the case in which the mass, immersed in the water
of the calorimeter, is a bad conductor of heat. A correction for this fact is certainly
inconsiderable and unnecessary if the immersed body conducts heat well, and the range
of temperature through which it cools in the liquid is great. This interval of tempera-
ture was in my experiments considerably smaller than in those of NEUMANN and of
REeGNAuLT; and as in my experiments the excess of heat of the contents of the glass
had to pass through its sides to the water of the calorimeter, it might be doubted
whether, when the temperature of the water was at its maximum, this temperature
could be considered as that of the contents of the glass. I have endeayoured to answer these questions experimentally.
