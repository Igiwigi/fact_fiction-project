The magnitude of these free energy barriers is consistent with etching
of diamond surfaces occurring as a result of spontaneous loss of methyl radicals.

(d) Solution phase dynamics studies

Another application where BXD has proved invaluable is in the area of solution phase
reaction dynamics [38]. In particular, this method has permitted atomic level insights into
solution phase bimolecular reaction dynamics for the following hydrogen abstraction systems:
(i) CN + cyclohexane [CN + CgHi2 > HCN + CgH1;] in dicholoromethane solvent [17,18,39],
and (ii) CN + tetrahydrofuran [CN + CyHgO — HCN + C4H70] in tetrahydrofuran solvent [40]. For these studies, the utility of BXD arises from the fact that it provides an integrated
methodology for (i) efficiently mapping the solution phase PMF, and (ii) accelerating reactive
events that would otherwise not be possible to simulate. To obtain PMFs for these solution phase :
systems, ‘boxes’ were defined in terms of the distance between the approaching CN and an H fo
atom on the co-reactant. Figure 7c shows results for CN + C6Hi2. 7%
PMF sampling in BXD is particularly elegant in these sorts of systems; however, the principal aw
advantage of BXD for the aforementioned solution phase systems is its ability to provide rare [B
event acceleration that furnishes meaningful dynamics insights.
