vials must have been consistently high, since in each closed vial was a damp cotton-wool
pad. Each day’s puparia from each vial were kept separately at 75° F, and the sex and date
of emergence of all progeny and the numbers of larvae in diapause from each day’s
oviposition were recorded. Similar experiments were then started using individuals (out of
diapause) from a family in which only 25-5 % of the progeny had entered diapause. In both
the above experiments brother-sister matings were used, and in a third set cross-mated
individual females of both families were used.

From these results it was apparent that there was no definite simple genetical basis
for the occurrence of diapause, the number of families with high and low percentage of
diapause being similar in all three sets.

However, an interesting fact did emerge, namely, that the age of the parent female when
an egg is laid has some bearing on the tendency of the larva hatching from it to go into
diapause. To illustrate this the results of ten of the above experiments are shown in table 1
and figure 1. Only the averages from the ten experiments are given, but each individual
family shows the same trend, namely, that the percentage of progeny entering diapause
increases with the age of the parent female at the time of oviposition. Contemporaneous
with this increase are variations in oviposition rate, developmental time of emergent
progeny, and sex ratio of emergents. These various factors will be discussed fully below, but
it became immediately obvious that the eggs laid by. a female throughout her life were by
no means uniform in their potentialities with regard to their subsequent development.

It has been observed with many species that temperature is an important factor in
determining diapause, and that, in general, low temperatures during the whole or certain
