between the sporangia of Stauropteris, and those of Psilotales and Sphenophyllales, is not
convincing. In fact, the terminal position of the sporangium was not peculiar only to


THE MORPHOLOGY OF STAUROPTERIS BURNTISLANDICA 89

Stauropteris, it was a common feature in the Devonian and early Carboniferous plants.
Similarly, I see no resemblance between a synangium of Psilotum or a strobilus of Spheno-
phyllum and a simple terminal sporangium of Stauropteris, which, indeed, is more like that
of Asteroxylon. The discovery of the heterosporous nature of Stauropteris has further com-
plicated the matter.

Stauropteris is, in fact, remarkable in showing a strange combination of characters of
different groups, a fact which perhaps explains the difficulty in assigning to it a correct
position in the plant world. In some respects it resembles the Psilophytales, from which
it has most probably evolved. At the same time it also shares some important characters
with the Zygopterideae. Further, since advanced heterospory is demonstrated in Stauro-
pteris it can no longer be included among the primitive ferns. Nothing else is known similar
to this type of megasporangia. The megasporangium of S. burntislandica with two mega-
spores shows a more advanced stage than that of Archaeopteris, where the number of spores
is eight to sixteen (Arnold 1947). Perhaps Stauropteris may be regarded as a member of a
series advancing in heterospory, possibly towards the evolution of seed habit from the
terminal sporangium of the Psilophytales. It may also be a side line of development
with no more recent representation.
