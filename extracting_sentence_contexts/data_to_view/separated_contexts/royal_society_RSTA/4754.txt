In standard flat-space :sS
twistor theory (see §1), a complex space-time point r in CM is represented by a complex line R 2S
(a Riemann sphere) in PT. A very similar situation holds for M, applying to any small-enough
open neighbourhood Vc M of a point ro € M, and we examine how an arbitrary point r of V
arises as a corresponding line R (Riemann sphere in an appropriate topological family) in a certain
complex 3-manifold PT, a deformed version of a tubular neighbourhood PP of a line P in PT. A striking feature of this construction is that there is no local curvature information in the
‘curved’ twistor space T (where PT is its projective version), despite the fact that there is actual
local curvature in the space V that is constructed from PT. This curvature arises entirely from
global features of T. Locally, T would be identical, when A = 0, to the twistor space T of §1.
