In Curve No. 35 (33°2 per cent. zinc) only the two upper points persist, all the lower
points having disappeared ; the same remarks apply to Curve No. 05. x In further reference to the points occurring in Curves 55 to 05 it should be pointed
Q out that the apparently feeble character of this heat evolution arises in part from the
8 fact that it occurs so soon after the commencement of freezing of the alloys; that
§ portion of the cooling-curve upon which this peak is shown slopes backward very
& steeply, and a very considerable evolution of heat is therefore required to arrest and
‘o even to reverse this steep slope. This circumstance somewhat militates against
§ accuracy in the determination of these peaks, the actual peaks shown on the curves
s> being in some cases not very much larger than experimental perturbations which now
sp and then occur. In order, however, to show definite evidence of the existence and
‘4 constant occurrence of these heat evolutions, three cooling-curves of the same ingot
