points; and the descriptive point, from which in the current theory the projective
point is ultimately derived, is here abolished. The “Theory of Tnterpoints” [ef.
Part III. (ii)] and the “Theory of Dimensions” [ef Part IV. (i)] represent two
distinct methods of overcoming the following initial and obvious difficulty of these
“linear” concepts:—A point is to be defined as the class of objective reals
“concurrent” at a point. But this definition is circular. How ean this circularity
be removed? The Theory of Interpoints and the Theory of Dimensions give two
separate answers to this question. The points in the linear concepts, being only
classes of objective reals, are capable of disintegration. In fact, when motion is
considered, it will be found that the points of one instant are, in general, different
from the points of another instant, not in the sense of Concept III. that they are the
same entities with different relations, but in the sense that they are different entities,
More difficulty will probably be felt in conceiving anything analogous to a line as a
simple unity. Here it is to be observed that a linear objective real does not replace
a line of points of ordinary geometry. On the contrary, the class of those points
(here called a punctual line), which have a given linear objective real as a common
member, is this ordinary geometrical line. A punctual line has parts and segments
in the ordinary way. The idea of a single unity underlying a straight line is not
wholly alien to ordinary language. The idea of a direction, as it could also be used
in non-Euclidian geometries where each line will have its own peculiar direction, may
be conceived as being that of a line taken as a unit. But it is unnecessary to
