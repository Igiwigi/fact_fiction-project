stroyed, no such symptoms occurred. Hence, though the sensory tracts proper end in
the gyrus fornicatus, yet it would appear that this convolution is also the termination
of tracts of a purely corticipetal character, a view which harmonises with FLEcusic’s
observation that some of the fibres belonging to his “third sensory system,” viz.,
those ending chiefly in the frontal Jobe, also pass into the gyrus fornicatus.

c. Frxcuste’s “ third sensory system” ascends from the optic thalamus by way
of the anterior limb of the internal capsule to terminate in the convolutions of the
frontal lobe.

Fecusic (8B) has pointed out that, although the optic thalamus is connected with
the several regions of the cerebral cortex to almost an equal extent, this is not so
with the frontal pole, where the thalamic fibres are evidently scanty, a fact which
we have been able to confirm from our observations. This is the corticipetal system
complementary to the descending tract of fibres which degenerates after removal of
the frontal lobe, to be described in the next section. (Series E.)

With the exception of Fiecusta’s “second sensory system,” the fibres which we
have described as degenerating after lesion of the optic thalamus to the frontal,
Rolandic, parietal, angular, and temporal regions of the cortex, form the “ corona
radiata thalami” of anatomists. It has been generally assumed that these fibres
conduct in an efferent or corticifugal direction. ‘The results of our experiments show
tbat this is not the case. They appear to be the cerebral continuation of the
tracts direct and indirect which enter the thalamus from below, viz., the mesial
fillet, the superior cerebellar peduncle, posterior quadrigeminal fibres, the short fibre
