They have proved themselves able volunteers in the cause of science. The Astronomer Royal, in his © Report to the Board of Visitors,” on June 2, 1860,
&ys *it is extremely difficult to extract from the accounts, even the careful ones, of
telegraph clerks, such an idea of the phases of the currents as will make them com-
parable with the phases of magnetic storms.” T can well enter into Mr. Airr's views;
and if I plead guilty to having not furnished him with observations made on my district,
to compare with the other observations that have reached him, it is because I have not
heretofore had the opportunity of fairly discussing the crude facts that have accumulated
in my hands. He further adds that * it may be worth considering whether it would
ever be desirable to establish in two directions at right angles to each other (for instance,


96 MR. C. V. WALKER ON MAGNETIC STORMS AND EARTH-CURRENTS,

along the Brighton Railway, and along the North Kent Railway) wires which would

photographically register in the Royal Observatory the GUEIVIES that —w in thees

directions, exhibiting their indications by photographic curves in close JuZiapoatden

with the registers of the magnetic elements*,” I think it would be very desirable, '
because it is not practicable on wires erected for other purposes, and with observers

whose duties with these wires are of an urgent nature, to secure an undisturbed series of
consecutive observations,—and the more 80 as the abnormal state comes on without

forewarning. Nor would it be necessary for this purpose to incur the cost of erecting a
long line of wire; for it will be seen, as we proceed, that one of the most active circuits

with which we have to deal is only three miles long.
