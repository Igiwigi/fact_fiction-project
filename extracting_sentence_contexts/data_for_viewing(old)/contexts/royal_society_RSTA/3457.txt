game and its dynamics

In this section, we will discuss the details of our (QFT-inspired) model, constructing first the
vectors of the players, the Hamiltonian of the system and deducing out of it, the differential
equations of motion and their solution, and we will be particularly interested in its asymptotic
(in time ft) behaviour.

In our game, we have two players, G and G2. Each player could operate, at t = 0, two possible
choices, 0 and 1. Hence, we have four different possibilities, to which, following Bagarello [19],
we associate four different and mutually orthogonal vectors in a four-dimensional Hilbert space
Hg. These vectors are 9,0, 1,0, 90,1 and Â¢,1. The first vector, go,9, describes the fact that, at t =0,
the two players have both chosen 0 (0102). Of course, such a choice can change during the time
evolution of the system. Analogously, gp,1 describes the fact that, at t=0, the first player has
chosen 0, while the second has chosen 1 (0:12). And so on. We see that Fy = {gx k,/=0,1} is
an orthonormal basis for Hg. The general mental state vector of the system Sg (i.e. of the two
players), for t = 0, is a linear combination

1
Y= > ax sg, (3.1)
kI=0

where it is natural to assume that yh 10 lor 17 =1 in order to normalize the total probability.
Indeed, for instance, we interpret lao,ol7 as the probability that Sg is, at t=0, in a state go, ie.
that both G; and Gz have chosen 0. Analogous interpretations can be given to the other coefficients.
