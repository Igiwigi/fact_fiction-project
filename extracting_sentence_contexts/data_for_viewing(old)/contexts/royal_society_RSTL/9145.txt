® Is now submitting the second instalment of my observations on the locomotor system
E of Meduxz to the consideration of this Society, I should like to preface the communi-
S cation with a few words to explain why several experiments which T had intended to
5 perform this season have been unayoidably postponed. Tt is well known to naturalists
SD that, from causes which .are not very well understood, the numbers of Medusw in the
I 8ame localities are subject, in different years, to considerable variations. Now on the
5 part of the coast where my work has throughout been carried on—viz. the Cromarty
w=] Firth, on the east of Scotland—the Medusz have been this year as scarce as last year
E they were abundant. Probably the cause of this scarcity in the land-locked position
bi occupied by the Cromarty Firth is in part to be attributed to the unusual prevalence
S of westerly winds which has this year been observable in that locality. But whatever
= the cause, the fact of this scarcity having existed has compelled me this year to restrict
= my observations, almost exclusively, to the genera Sarsia, Tiaropsis, and Aurelia. By
Z way of introduction it is only necessary further to state that, for the sake of facilitating
= reference, I shall endeayour to construct the present communication on as nearly as
5 poSible the same general plan as the last one.

S $1. Effects of excising the entire margins of Nectocalyces —Under this heading I
5 have very little to add to the statements contained in my former paper. Many of the
A experiments which I haye this year performed have necessitated, in a vast number of
