Generally, also, if the sum of the products of the square roots of the latent roots
of the function vanishes, an infinite number of tetrahedra may be found related to
their correspondents, so that corresponding edges a,b; a’, b’, are intersected by
opposite edges of intermediate tetrahedra. (Compare Art. 25.)

28. The case in which the two invariants n’ and n/”

vanish simultaneously is of con-
siderable importance in the theory of the linear function. These conditions are
always satisfied for the functions 2f,=/f—//’; and also for functions of a more

general type; in fact, for functions whose squares satisfy a depressed equation
(PP + nif $= 0, or (PA P—s)=0 . . . (180).

It appears from Art. 24 that two systems of tetrahedra exist, one set having their
correspondents inseribed to them, the other set being inscribed to their corre-
spondents. We shall prove that one system of tetrahedra exists which are at once
inscribed and circumscribed to their correspondents.

Let q, and q, be the united points of f for the roots + s, and q’, and q’, for the
roots +s’. Take any line whatever

G = e(Qy + ge) + (V1 + 24's) (a, y variable). . . . (181),
