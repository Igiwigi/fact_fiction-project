60. Although these rezults were sufficient to show that air-currents could not be the
cause of the moyements of the balance, I was anxious to decide this point once for all,
by a form of experiment which, whilst it would settle the question indisputably, would
be likely at the same time to afford information of much interest. Having found that
the balance last experimented with had its neutral point close to an ordinary Sprengel
vacuum, that the repulsive action only came on by still further pushing the exhaustion,

and that, as I further exhausted, the repulsion got stronger, it was of interest to see
what would take place in a vacuum 80 nearly perfect that it would not carry a current
from a RunMKoRey's coil,

In small tubes, and taking certain special precautions, T could prepare a yacuum with
my Sprengel pump which would hardly allow an induction-current to traverse it, or would
only show a faint, cloud-like discharge ; but it was impossible to effect this in the large
tubes required for these experiments, and, in fact, all the Sprengel vacuum balance-

tubes which I had hitherto prepared became brightly luminous
when the current from an induction-coil was passed through
them. I accordingly fitted up the apparatus shown in figure 5,

in which a chemical vacuum could be prepared by a method
first devised by Dr. AxDREws (Philosophical Magazine, February
1852). 51.
