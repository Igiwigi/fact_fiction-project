p. 337. It relates
to the action of the magnet on a magnetic needle, on soft iron, on the deutoxide and tritoxide of iron, on the
tritoxide alone, and on a needle of wood. The author observed, and quotes CouLons as having also observed,
that a needle of wood, under certain conditions, pointed across the magnetic curves ; and he also states the
striking fact that he had found a needle of wood place itself parallel to the wires of a galvanometer. These
effects, however, he refers to a degree of magnetism less than that of the tritoxide of iron, but the same in
character, for the bodies take the same position. The polarity of steel and iron is stated to be in the direction
of the length of the substance, but that of tritoxide of iron, wood and gum-lac, most frequently in the direction
ofthe width, and always when one magnetic pole is employed.
