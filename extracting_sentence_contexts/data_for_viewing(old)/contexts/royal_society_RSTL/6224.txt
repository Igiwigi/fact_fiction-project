S result is obtained on attempting to separate the base from the sulphate by means
> of baryta. After filtering off the sulphate of barium, there remains a strongly alkaline
2 liquid, which likewise yields only the octohedral platinum-salt, while the presence of
= bromide of barium in the solution indicates the transformation of the original molecular
2 system. The elimination of the second equivalent of bromine by silver-salts, which
= takes place instantly and completely in alkaline liquids, may likewise be effected by
S continual ebullition in neutral and even in acid s0lutions, though always slowly and
Z incompletely. If the bromide be precipitated by excess of nitrate of silver, the filtered
Ss liquid, on being boiled and evaporated, deposits a fresh quantity of bromide of silver ;
E but in most cases, even after long-continued boiling, a considerable quantity of bromine
8 remains latent, and may be immediately recognized by again filtering the liquid and
Slightly supersaturating it with ammonia, the whole of the remaining bromine being
then precipitated as bromide of silyer. This deportment furnishes in fact a character-
istic distinction of the bromethylated bromide, by which this substance may often be
conveniently recognized, It deserves to be remarked that the fixed caustic alkalies exert
but a slight action on the bromethylated bromide; the compound is precipitated by
the alkalies from its cold aqueous s0lution in the crystalline state and without decompo-
Sition, and it is only after some time that alterations take place, probably affecting its
intimate constitution. The nature of these alterations has not yet been made out. The
crystals may be boiled for some time with alcoholic solution of potassa without decom-
position. The bromide likewise suffers no alteration by continued digestion with water
or alcohol at 100Â®.
