240 K. LONSDALE ON THE DIVERGENT-BEAM

Now there is, from this formula, no geometrical reason why A” should coincide with A,
and in fact it only appears to do so for one particular wave-length value, that of Cu Ka,. The photographs (plate 16, figure 21c, and others not reproduced) and the figures 12 and 13.
show that the intersection of 311, 311 is only coincident with that of 004, 022 and 022 for
Cu Ka, radiation, and not for Cu Ka,, Cu Kf or Zn Ka. The same is true of the intersection of the 313, 313 circles, which occurs at a point A”
along the direction OA, but at an angular distance from O given by

19 A

Spacing or lattice constant measurement

Since A, A” and A” do, in fact, coincide for a particular and accurately known value of A,
a precision determination of the lattice constant a can be made by solving the equations
