which move forward with the velocity of the jet, and in 286 in amplitude very rapidly with the time ;

and that the instability of the jet increases without limit with the pitch of the disturbances.
The second paper deals, amongst other topics, with cases of jets of frictionless flaid under certain
hypothetical conditions which approximate to those of the actual jets which come under experiment. It

is 8hown that the instability of the jet, 80 far from increasing without limit with the pitch of the

disturbances, 800 reaches a maximum; and that for disturbances of still shorter wave-length than thoze
which are most effective this instability is finally exchanged for actual stability.

Tt is to be hoped that the distinguished anthor of these papers may himself discnss their full bearing
on the facts here recorded, ]

Further, let the manometer orifice be moved from any point on the axis of the jet
towards the circumference ; a fall in velocity may again be noted which is steep near
the jet axis, but becomes slower as the cireumference is approached.

A similar change may be noticed jus at or even inside the jet orifice ; but here the
fall is more steep than at external points,
