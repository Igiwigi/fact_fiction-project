lobe bearing near its tip a soft plumose seta which pointed roughly forwards and which
was exactly of the type we have described in the Anostraca and Cladocera.

If the Cladocera evolved from the Conchostraca, this has been brought about by the
abbreviation of the body, by the reduction of trunk segments. Now all the Conchostraca
typically hatch as nauplius, and as development proceeds new limb-bearing segments

appear at the hind end; that is, an Hstheria passes through a larval stage in which
the number of trunk limbs is the same as that of, e.g., Sida. In fact, a larval Estheria
with six trunk limbs looks like a Cladoceran, as at this stage it has biramous swimming
antenne, the head is not yet enclosed in the shell, and the adductor muscle has not
yet come into play to produce the laterally compressed adult form. The Cladocera
may thus be regarded in a sense as pedogenetic Conchostraca. They are sexually mature
larval Conchostraca exhibiting larval characters in the type of swimming antennz,
the carapace, the number of trunk segments, and now, we may add, in the maxilla.

More interesting than the comparison of the larval Conchostraca with the adult
Cladocera is that with the adult Lepidocaris, for here we find that maxillules, maxille
and gnathobases are essentially the same, fig. 32.
