In the cypridinid ostracod, Doloria, I suggested that the thin dorsal body wall of the
trunk, with its criss-cross musculature, functions largely in moving body fluids (Cannon
1931, p. 448). In Gigantocypris, I extended this view and showed how the movement of the
mouth and mouthparts towards the opening in the bivalve shell is brought about by a
hydrostatic mechanism (Cannon 1940, p. 195). The movement of parts of the body of a
barnacle, I consider, show a similar, but much greater differentiation of this power of
hydrostatic control.

6. MECHANISM OF EXTRUSION OF BODY

Theventral longitudinal muscles of the trunk region occupy a typical position on either side
ofthe nerve chain, forming, in fact, the walls ofan epineural blood sinus (figures 4 and 5). They
consist, on either side, of an inner series and a separate lateral constituent which I deal with
later. The inner series is attached to the tendinous sheets which extend inwards from the deep
intersegmental folds along the ventral body wall. From these same sheets oblique muscles
extend posterodorsally. Anteriorly the inner series bifurcates into an upper muscle which
attaches to the hinder lateral edge of the oral cone, and a lower muscle which runs to a small
endosternite situated directly below the mouth and behind the oesophagus (figures 4 and 5).
