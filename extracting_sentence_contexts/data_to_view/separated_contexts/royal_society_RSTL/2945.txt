T have thought it proper to make these introductory remarks, because of the neces-

+ Professor Baz called the vesicle he discovered in the ovary, not the ovum but the © ovulum.” If, how-
ever, it can be made to appear extremely probable that the chorion or external membrane of the oyum of the
uterus is a primitive part of the ovarian vesicle of Baz, it is perhaps better to call the latter an ovum, as will
be done in this memoir,


302 DR. MARTIN BARRY'S RESEARCHES IN EMBRYOLOGY.

sity that lies before me, in offering the present contribution in embryology, for pointing
out several other structures connected with the discovery of Bax, the nature of which
I believe this author to have mistaken, and some that appear to have escaped his
notice. This I shall do with great deference, asking his re-inspection of the parts, and
respectfully soliciting an examination of them by other physiologists who have been
engaged in researches on the early stages of the oyum of the Mammalia, especially
Professors PuRKINJE, Kravuss and Cosrs ; but more particularly Professor VatexTIN
and my valued friend Professor RupoLen WAGNER,

In the course of this investigation, which occupied many months, the number of
individual animals examined was very large, furnishing me an opportunity for yeri-
fying most of the facts by repeated observation. The examinations were generally
made very s00n after death; and the drawings having been all taken by myself, I
have it in my power to say that their fidelity may be relied upon. In the year 1837, preparatory to the commencement of my own researches, I spent
some time in Germany for the purpose of becoming acquainted with the known
facts on animal development and other objects of microscopic research ; and cannot
omit this opportunity of gratefully acknowledging the facilities afforded me on that
occasion by my honoured friends Professors Jonanxn MuLLEr, EnrgxBeRG, RUpoLePa
Wage, and Dr.
