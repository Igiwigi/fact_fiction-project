It worked in large
part by finding, cultivating and paying experts to
Author for correspondence: endorse the industry’s claims in the mass media and

the public debate, and to legitimatize the alterations
to textbooks and curricula. The similarities between
the electric industry strategy and the defence of
tobacco, lead paint and fossil fuels suggests that these
strategies work for reasons that are not specific to
the particular technical claims under consideration. This paper argues that a reason for the cultural
persistence of doubt is what we may label the ‘fact
of uncertainty’. Uncertainty is intrinsic to science, and
this creates vulnerabilities that interested parties may,
and commonly do, exploit, both by attempting to
challenge the specific conclusions of technical experts
and by implying that those conclusions threaten other
social values. Naomi Oreskes
