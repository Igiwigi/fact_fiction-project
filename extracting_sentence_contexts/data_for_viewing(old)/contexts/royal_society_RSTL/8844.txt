These results leave no doubt that rolling-friction does not depend greatly on the
coefficient of sliding-friction between the roller and the surface. They are, however,
completely in accordance with the explanation previously given of the manner in which
sliding-friction acts to prevent the deformation of the surfaces at the point of contact.

The Tendency to Oscillate.

Another cireumstance which was observed while making these experiments also offers
Strong evidence of this deformation, namely the tendency which the roller has to oscillate.
This was always exhibited whenever the roller was Slightly disturbed from rest on the
level plane, and it was certainly not due to the fact of its having settled into a hollow ;
for when on india-rubber it would make seyeral considerable oscillations in whaterer

position it was placed. By blackleading the surface this tendency was considerably
reduced, although not altogether destroyed. These oscillations could not have been
caused by the mere resistance which the one surface offered to the sliding of the other
over it, unless also this resistance threw the surfaces into constraint from which they
are constantly endeayouring to free themselves.

The effect of the Softness of the Materials.
