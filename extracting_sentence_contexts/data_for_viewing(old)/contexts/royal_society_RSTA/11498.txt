hence is small if the correlation be close, and increases rapidly if the correlation be
small. This again illustrates the point to which reference has been made in another
memoir,* namely, that when only a few individuals can be measured, the most
reliable results for the purposes of the quantitative theory of evolution are to be
found from the measurements of the most highly correlated organs.

Attention should be drawn to the fact that we have replaced errors by differentials,
This is only legitimate so long as product terms in the errors are negligible as.com-
pared with linear terms. This is the assumption almost universally made by writers
on the theory of errors.* It will not lead us astray, so long as we take care in any
practical applications to verify the smallness of Ar,, Ao,, Ao,, as compared with
I, 7, and o» respectively.

(8) To find the Probable Errors and Error Correlations of the Constants of a
Normal Frequency Distribution for Three Organs or more,

It will searcely have escaped the attentive reader that our investigation hitherto,
only involving two organs, has left several important problems untouched. For
example, it has dealt only with the direct effect of random selection. But we may
