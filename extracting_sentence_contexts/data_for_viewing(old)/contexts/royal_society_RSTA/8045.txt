still further intramolecular saturation. The grids themselves are held together by
intermolecular forces probably of the kind postulated above to account for the occurrence
of the spacing 4-65 A., and the multiple molecular weights of proteins.

The reflection (200), corresponding to the spacing 4-65 A., is the strongest in the
6-photograph, and it is quite clear from the models of fig. 26, Plate 9, why this should
be so, for the polypeptide grids, containing the main-chains and side-chains, lie in
the planes giving rise to this reflection. The main-chains lie also, in both the «- and
the $-form, in planes parallel to (001), so that a strong reflection from this plane occurs
too, and persists, as already pointed out, in spite of the intramolecular transformation.
The occurrence of the meridian reflection (020), at 3-4 A., may also be predicted from
the models, since the side-chains are distributed along the main-chains so as to lie in
planes of this spacing, though the fact that they project on alternate sides of the main-
chains leads to an “ identity period ” of 6-8 A.

The Intramolecular Elastic Mechanism.

The intramolecular long-range elasticity of keratin is so striking as to invite the
closest study, for the principles underlying it, or principles sufficiently analogous, must
lie also at the bottom of numerous other dimensional changes in biological structures,
notably those occurring in muscle. On approaching the problem it is natural to consider
once more the elastic behaviour of silk fibroin, which constitutes probably the simplest
protein fibre available. X-rays show why silk fibroin has no long-range elasticity ; it
is, in fact, because its long-chain molecules are normally in a fully-extended state com-
