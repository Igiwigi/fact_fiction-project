that Q is large. If we ignore the dimensions of the various terms, and take the
unit of time as 1 second, then Q is in practice greater than 100 (radians per second),
all other terms being of the order unity. This is really equivalent to assuming that
all the ratios «/Q, h/Q,..., which are of no dimensions, are small. _ It will be found
necessary to assume further that all derivatives with respect to the time are of order
unity in units of 1 second, eg., that x’, «”, s’, Q’..., are of order unity. These
conditions are satisfied in practice. As a result, we can say that «/Q, s‘/Q..., are
small quantities of the first order, and «’/Q*, s”/Q?, @”,/Q?..., are small quantities of
the second order. For simplicity, we shall throughout ignore dimensions, and denote
such terms of the first order by O(1/Q), and terms of the second order by O (1/0?).*
The arithmetical values of the various terms are investigated in detail in § 4.3 below.

The above facts indicate the lines on which an approximate solution is to be
sought—we require the asymptotic expansion of the solution (or its leading terms)
for large values of the parameter Q. Methods of obtaining such expansions have

* In practice the spin N, and therefore 2, decreases slightly along the trajectory, but the diminution
is not sufficient to affect the assumption that 2 is large.

is slightly different algebraically, is more convenient here ; the asymptotic properties
of our solutions, however, may be regarded as established by the researches of these
