Let us fix a weakly convergent
sequence of controls uy — ux in L({0, T],U). As done in the proof of theorem 3.3, we can
associate with each of these controls a sequence of solutions ¢y(t) = (yn(t), wn(t), MN (E) =
(yn (t), Wn (t), xn (#), un (E)) of (5.4) uniformly convergent to a solution ¢,(t) = (y.(f),Ws(t), H(t) of
(5.2) in the sense of definition 3.1 with control u,. and initial datum (y?, w°, 1°). In view of the
fact that solutions ¢y(t) and ¢,(t) will have supports uniformly bounded with respect to N and
t €[0, T] and by the uniform convergence of trajectories (yy (t), wn (t)) = (y(t), wx(t)) as well as the
uniform convergence Wj (jn(t), 2(f)) > 0 for t € [0, T], it follows from condition (L) that

T T
lim I, Lon), wn (8), nn) = \, L(ye(t),We(t), na()) at. (65)


Note that, thanks to remark 3.4, here we are allowed to consider the convergence of the entire
sequence (¢y))Nen and we do not need to restrict to a subsequence (and this is a crucial issue in
order to properly derive the I — lim inf condition!). By the assumed weak convergence of (11) Ne
to u* € L'([0, T],U/), we obtain the lower-semicontinuity of the norm

lim_ inf ae Dimvtoiat= = |, Dieta (5.6)

N->+00
By combining (5.5) and (5.6), we immediately obtain the  — lim inf condition
lim inf Fy(un) > F(x). Noo

We need now to address the /’—limsup condition.
