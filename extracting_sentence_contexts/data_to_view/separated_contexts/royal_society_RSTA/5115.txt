Thus they do not
present a problem. At higher values of tan 6 and yu < 0, there is a strip where this is not a problem, and is shown
in figure 8b: the uppermost strip with two solutions (the lower strip is ruled out by having light
charginos that would have been seen at the LEP2 collider). In fact, the multiple solutions in table 1
are taken from this ‘phenomenologically plausible strip’. Squarks from the first two generations
and gluino masses display a negligible difference between the different solutions in this strip. The
neutralino mass can be different by about 1-2%, depending upon the position in the plane.
