it is difficult to reconcile with Bloch & Bradbury’s value of not more than 0-17eV.+ Thus
Weiss applied his method also to obtain the electron affinity of OH, and the value he derived,
3-7 eV, is quite comparable with the 2-1 eV obtained by Goubeau & Klemm (1937) from
a study of cyclic processes involving the alkali hydroxides.

Loeb (1935) has attempted to obtain direct experimental evidence as to the magnitude
of the energy required to detach electrons from the negative ions formed in a high-frequency
discharge in oxygen, by collisions with oxygen gas molecules. Quantitative analysis of his
results is difficult owing to the complexity of the phenomena involved, but evidence was
obtained indicating that collision detachment begins when the mean energy of the ions
passing through the gas is between 0-14 and 0-68 eV, the latter being the more probable
value. Apart from experimental uncertainties this does not necessarily mean that the
vertical detachment energy? of O5 lies between 0-07 and 0:34eV (allowing for the fact that
only half the total translational energy will be available to effect detachment in a collision
between O, and O;). The energy distribution of the ions will make the effect apparent at
a mean energy less than that just sufficient for the reaction to proceed. Further, both O
and O- will be present and reactions such as

O-+0,+O,+e, O+0;>0,-+4¢,

with onset energies of about 1-1 and —0-1 eV respectively (electron affinity of O, 2:2eV or
O,, LeV —dissociation energy, 1-1 eV§, of O,), must be taken into account. Loeb’s experi-
mental results cannot therefore be regarded as establishing Bloch & Bradbury’s requirement
of an electron affinity of O, between 0-07 and 0-17eV. In considering alternative inter-
pretations of the attachment phenomena we therefore do not restrict ourselves by this
