His conje&ures indeed about ;
the cauſe from whence the difference might ariſe, are
not the-moſt natural ; and in one point he was evi-
dently miſtaken: namely, that he imagined the ab-
ſolute elaſticity to be conſtant at every given eleva-
tion; and accordingly he hath traced the curye,
which, according to his experiments, exhibits the
laws of its variations from one. height to another. This, it muſt be conteſſed, was truſting his expe-
ments too far, which were not made with the moſt
accurate inſtruments ; and this may have given oc-
cafion to his learned countryman M. DE LA LANDE, |
to ſuppole that this curve may rather exhibit the de-
viations of his experiments from thetruth, than any
thing which really obtains in nature), His general |
hypotheſis, however, of a difference of abfolute |
eJaſticity, in different parts of the atmoſphere, muſt
obtain, whenever the temperatures of ſuch different
parts are unequal; unleſs the effe& of the inequality
of temperature were to be compenſated by the ſyn-
chronous unequal operations of ſome other caule,
'Fhat it does in fact obtain, when the temperature
is unequal, is proved, beyond 'a doubt, inſtead of
being refuted, by M. pe Luc's experiments; and
this is to be conſidered, as a further inſtance of their
exa& agreement with the genuine concluſions of
accurate theory.

When: the abſolute elaſticities are different” at
different heights, the denſities will no longer be
proportional to. the preſſures ; and the change of
denſity, throughout the whole column: of the at- ..
molſphere, will no longer be repreſented by any one
logarithmic. But to ſmall diſtances on one lide or
the other of different heights, it may ſtill be nearly

S repreſented by parts of different logarithmics. Now
A this is really the caſe, according to M.
