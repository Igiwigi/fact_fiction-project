Question 6 : &

Mike Finis Ijust wanted to ask if you could discover anything about the correction
to the phase diagram through this work? Ben Britton There is a gap between the dissolution and precipitation of the hydrides
[?], and that is related to the strain field. And so some of this will have an
influence on this phenomenon, which is related to how the hydrides are
evolving.
