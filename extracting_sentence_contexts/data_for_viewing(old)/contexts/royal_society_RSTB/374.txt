The deformity is due to the fact that the larve, when blinded, dash their heads
about, and so tend to spread the varnish over a much larger area, and it is thus liable
to harden on the top of the head, and to prevent the latter from splitting in the
complete manner which is necessary for ecdysis.

I have been obliged to quote an “apparent” degree of colour for the deformed
pup, because it was difficult to judge them by the same standard as the normal ones.
In the result it is to be noted that the white roof produced a strong effect on the
pup suspended from it, and that those attached to the side of the low cylinder also
came under its influence. The floor was white, but the relative proximity of the dark
leaves and stems of the food-plant may have made all the difference. On the other
hand, these pupze were not crowded together, as in the majority of the A. division.
This last important difference in arrangement, which must certainly produce some
