have transverse processes, which increase in size on passing backwards, as shown in
the figure.

The shoulder girdle is not very well preserved. The lower portion of the scapula is
expanded to give articulation to the large flattened precoracoid of the upper part of the
coracoid. As shown in the figure the precoracoid is irregularly quadrangular, though
rounded in front. Its posterior edge just enters the glenoid cavity. The coracoid is
rather small and crescent-shaped. The articular surface looks entirely outwards. The
clavicles, though preserved, are somewhat crushed, and there are small portions of the
interclavicles also preserved.

The most interesting point in connection with the shoulder girdle of this specimen is
the fact that there is a large well-developed ossified sternum. In the plate this is figured
in the crushed condition, and in the text-fig. 2 as it would appear before being crushed.
There is little doubt that its upper border articulated with the coracoid and its lower
border has a clear articulation for either a cartilaginous or bony xiphisternum. On the
sides there are the articulations for certainly three ribs, and I think possibly for four.

Both humeri are nearly perfectly preserved and they are of the type long since described
by Owen in Cynodraco serridens, Ow. With careful preparation most of the muscular
attachments will, I believe, be revealed. In the meantime it seems but necessary to
state that they are relatively large in comparison with the size of the skull. In marked
