trary manner upon the value of x. Now we know that every such term as the above
satisfies the differential equation, and it may be asked, what more is required to prove
the correctness of the solution ? I answer, that the point in question is whether

. Is o 6

is equivalent to the most general interpretation of

and, if not, whether the most general interpretation would satisfy the Differential Equa-
tion (35.).

The expression (A.) gives, in fact, no new result, being an evident consequence of the
conclusions of the former sections.

PosrscrIPT (Added May 29, 1857).

Mr. CavLEy has been kind enough to communicate to me direct verifications of the
equation (27.), art. 14, and of the identity referred to in art. 16. Asswming a formula
established in Mr. Cariey's paper © On certain Formule for Differentiation,” &c.*, the
former of the two theorems just mentioned is easily obtained, the latter not without a
good deal of trouble. The investigations of Section II. may be compared with some of
those in the Introduction to Murenr's ©Electricity;* but I have not at present examined
the latter with a view to such comparison, and therefore merely mention the subject.
