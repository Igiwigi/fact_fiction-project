HunTER; and a Paper of his, containing a description of the
organs of generation of different free-martins, to shew that they
are by no means uniformly the same; or partake equally of the
parts belonging to both sexes, is published in the Philosophical
Transactions, Vol. LXIX. _ To add to these dissections an ac-
count of similar formation of the organs of generation in a dog,
is the intention of the present Paper. The subject having already
been considered an object deserving the attention of this learned
Society, is an inducement for bringing forward new facts, and
observations which have been made respecting them. The- causes of monstrous productions of every kind are at
present equally unknown, but it is highly probable that they are
very similar; and, when once, they. have been brought into
action, it would be reasonable to suppose, that the influence
should be continued. to ;severali young, in succession;./this./is,
