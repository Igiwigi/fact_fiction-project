A few points only will therefore
be here referred to. Both the D satellites for m = 1 and the F lines for m = 2 with
related lines form the majority of the lines in the long wave end of the spectrum
(n < 20000). One clue as to a distinction between the two sets may be found in
the fact that where the 5640 link occurs on a D line it links backwards, while in
the F it links forward. Consequently where a line has a link forward it is probably
