From these it appears that the main stem of the ventral lymphatic
system opens out anteriorly to form a complex system of lymph spaces between the
sterno-hyoideus muscles and around the thyroid body, and that the lobules and vesicles of
the thyroid body project into these spaces and are thus freely bathed inlymph. As yet
I have been unable to work out in detail the relation of this labyrinth of spaces to the
rest of the lymphatic system or to the veins, so that I cannot say how far they represent
the sinuses described above. Little appears to have been published upon the lymphatics in the thyroid region of
Teleosteans ; in fact, so far as I have been able to find out, the pericardial sinuses, to
which the parts described above in Lophius are most nearly similar, have been examined
hitherto only in the Ganoid Amia (7) by Hopxrys, and in Scorpenichthys by ALLEN (1). Tn Scorpenichthys, of whose lymphatics ALLEN gives a very full and elaborate account,
the pericardial sinuses are highly complex. He describes the main trunk of the ventral
superficial system as terminating in front in a large sinus (ventral pericardial sinus)
lying longitudinally below the pericardium.
