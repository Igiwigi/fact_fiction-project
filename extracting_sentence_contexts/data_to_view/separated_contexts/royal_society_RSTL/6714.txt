The time of fall at the constant pressure of 100 millims., through a range
s of forty divisions of the diffusiometer, was, for air 1210 seconds, for hydrogen 321 seconds.

The time, again, from 736 to 685 millims. (29 to 27 inches) was, for air 685 anq

appears again less influenced by capillary transpiration, In fact the molecular ratio of
1 to 3:80 is approached within 1 per cent. Biscuitware therefore appears to be but
little mferior to graphite for 8uch experiments, a circumstance which is important, as
