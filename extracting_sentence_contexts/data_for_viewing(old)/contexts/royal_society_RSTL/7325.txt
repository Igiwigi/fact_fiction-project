at least twelve hours before the distillation is commenced. The latter operation can
then be performed over a naked fire or gas-flame, and continued till water alone passes
over. In this way there was obtained 6000 grms. of an acetic ether absolutely free
from alcohol, and which, without previous washing, only needs one rectification from
fused and powdered chloride of calcium to fit it for the action of sodium. A determi-
nation of its vapour-density gave the number 2:9, Pure acetic ether requires 3-04.

When acetic ether thus prepared is placed in contact with sodium it becomes hot,
and a considerable quantity of gas is evolyed, which, after being passed first through
alcohol and then through water, burns with a non-luminous flame, and the products of
combustion do not produce the slightest turbidity on agitation with baryta-water. In

. fact the gas is pure hydrogen. When the action is complete, the liquid solidifies on
cooling to a mass resembling yellow beeswax. By putting the sodium- into the acetic
ether as just described, it is difficult to conduct the operation to completion, owing to
the liquid gradually assuming such a thick and pasty condition as to prevent the further
action of the sodium. We therefore adopted the following modification, which enabled
us to push the reaction almost to its extreme limit.

A (fig. 1) is a flask containing the acetic ether, and standing in an oil-bath, B. The
neck of the flask was closed with a caoutchonc cork, through which passed the beak of
the quilled receiver C, containing the s8odium cut up into pieces about 1 inch 8quare
and 2 inch thick. Into the wide neck of this receiver was inserted an inverted LinB1G's
condenser, D, which projected sufficiently into the vessel to allow the condensed liquid
to drip back upon the 8odium. Heat being applied to the oil-bath, the acetic ether
