We would pass from this part of our subject, since our knowledge of the process
of secondary degeneration has shown that in the arrangement of the experiment al]
we do is to observe at one (the spinal) end of a column of fibres the changes evoked
by stimulating these fibres at the other (corona radiata) end, were it not that the
above effect is capable of modification in a manner which demands consideration.
Moreover, we wish to emphasise the fact, that in its simplest form the corona radiata
effect, as observed in the cord, is an example of the application of the galvanometric
method to the determination of directly continuous nerve tracts in the central
nervous system. This, as we shall see later in dealing with the spinal cord itself, is
one of the most valuable uses to which the method can be put. Thus when a definite
tonic effect, and that only, is evoked by the excitation, the application of the stimulus
to any fibres of the corona radiata, except those immediately underlying the focus of
representation of the movement of the lower limb, produces no electrical changes in
the lower dorsal cord, even though the muscles of other parts are sent into tonic
contraction. The modifications we have referred to above, are those which have been
observed by most workérs with the graphic method, and consist in the presence of an
after-effect in no wise differing from the clonic stage of the full cortical discharge save
in duration and completeness, The assumption is naturally that in the arrangement
