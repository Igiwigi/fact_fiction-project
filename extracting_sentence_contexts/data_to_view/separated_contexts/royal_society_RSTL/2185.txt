This receiver ſhould remain as long:
as the fumes are colourleſs ; but when they appear, in the
neck of the retort, of a yellow colour, it is a mark that the
mercurial nitre will immediately produce dephlogiſticated air
the receiver ſhould then be withdrawn, and an apparatus placed'
to receive the air, The reſt of the proceſs has been ſufficiently
explained i in my former letter,
"The phlogiſticated nitrous acid, faturated by an alkali, will
not -cryſtallize ;. and, if expoſed to evaporation, even in the”
heat of the air, will become alkaline again, which thews the
weakneſs of its affinity with alkalies when diflolvedin water *;'
a farther proof of which is, that it is expelled from them by'
all the acids, even by vinegar (which fa& has been” obſerved'
by Mr. ScyegLE), I HAUT obſerved, that litmus is no teſt of
the ſaturation of this acid by alkalies ; for the infuſion of lit-'
mus added to fuch a mixture will turn red; when the liquor
appears to be highly alkaline, by its turning the infuſions of
violets, roſe leaves, and moſt other red juices, green. This
does not proceed from the infuſion of litnus being more ſenſi-
ble to the preſence of acids than other teſts ; for I have lately
diſcovered a teſt liquor (the preparation of which I mean to ©
publiſh ſoon) which is mo ſenſible to the hs of acids ,

and that he has mentioned it in a Paper lately read before the Royal Society ; but IG

than litmus is; but which turns green in the ſame ſolution of
Wepiſicated nitre that turns litmus red,

—— unavoidable little accidents which have attended theſe
experiments, and which tend to render their reſults dubious,
have prevented me from relying on them as full proofs of the

Gated air; though they give great probability to the ſuppoſi-
D on, I have, therefore, explained the whole of the hypotheſis
nd experiments with the diffidence which ought to accompany
wvery attempt to account for the phenomena of nature on
Sther principles than thoſe which are commonly received by
iloſophers'in general. And'in purſuance of the fame mo»
Eves it 15 proper to mention, that the alkali employed to fatu-
Eite the phlogiſticated nitrous acid, was always' that of tartar
S hich is partly mild ; and T have not examined whether highly
Bhlogiſticated nitrous acid can perfe&tly' expel: fixedair from an
Jlkah, though 1 know no fat which proves the contrary. Te
thould alſo be” examined, whether the ſame quantity of real
fitrous acid 1s requiſite to ſaturate a given quantity of alkali,

: logiſticated.
