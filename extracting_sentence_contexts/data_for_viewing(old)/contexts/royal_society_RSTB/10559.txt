by the end of training, a network with an MSP lesion exhibits
virtually no sensitivity to regularities.

(iii) Statistical learning with an undeveloped TSP

Infants are good at statistical learning despite having immature
hippocampi [16,17], and our model suggests that this may be
because the MSP develops earlier than the TSP [18,40]. To test
the boundary case of infants only having access to the MSP
(though they may have some limited use of the TSP), we ran
additional simulations with the TSP lesioned. We found that
learning and representations were essentially unchanged (elec-
tronic supplementary material, figure S2). In fact, pairmate
retrieval was slightly better without versus with the TSP (at
the end of training, mean A — B retrieval: 0.98 versus 0.94,
respectively, toog = 6.66, p < 0.001; mean B — A retrieval: 0.90
versus 0.87, toog = 2.49, p = 0.01). This stands in contrast to
the very detrimental effects of an MSP lesion (electronic sup-
plementary material, figure S1b), revealing that the MSP is
necessary and sufficient for statistical learning and providing
a possible explanation for intact rapid statistical learning in
infants despite protracted hippocampal development.

(b) Higher level learning
