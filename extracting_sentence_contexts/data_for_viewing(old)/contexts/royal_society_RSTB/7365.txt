discrimination would be expected, because the red and green curves are intersecting and
one curve falls steeply, as the other rises, with change of wave-length. The same reasoning
applies to the blue-green region, where in consequence high colour discrimination would
be anticipated. When, therefore, colour discrimination is plotted against wave-lengths, a
W-shaped curve would be expected, that is, two troughs, one in the blue-green and one in
the yellow, separated by a crest in the green.

Laurens & Hamilton (1923), who investigated this matter experimentally, found a more
complicated curve than that just described; so also did Pitt & Wright (1934). In the case
of the former, there were four troughs instead of only two, separated by three well-marked
rounded crests. The troughs were at 4300, 4850, 5800 and 6150A;; the crests were at 4550,
5300 and 6050A. The general level of acuity is higher in the yellow-green than it is else-
where. None of these facts is easy to account for on the three-colour theory. With three
crests and four troughs there must be five different receptors distributed throughout the
spectrum. But, as Granit has pointed out (1945), additional receptors would probably be

required in the green and in the yellow regions of the spectrum, in order to provide the

high discrimination which experiment shows to be present there, for-the trough in the
green is not only deep, but wide; while the yellow trough is even deeper, and it is flanked
on the long-wave side by the red trough, with which it is practically continuous.
