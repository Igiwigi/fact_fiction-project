The reduction in the ionisation is greater if the wire is made the cathode
than if it is made the anode. 48 MR. 0. W. RICHARDSON ON THE IONISATION

All the above facts point to the view that the reduction of the negative leak in
hydrogen produced by the application of a high potential is due to a change in the
surface caused by the bombardment of the surface by the positive ions produced in
the gas by ionising collisions. This view is supported by the fact that after the high
potential had been applied a greater heating current was always required to maintain
the wire at its original temperature. This shows that the amount of heat radiated
from the surface at a given temperature was greater than before, so that the nature
of the surface must have become changed in some way.
