the first three. Thus it sufficed to calculate the a, b coefficients in the usual way for
D, H and V, and the work so far as D is concerned had been already done.

The values of a and b for the year, or for any season, are the arithmetic means of
the values from the included months. They can thus be deduced at pleasure from the
values of a and b calculated for the included months, or be specially calculated from
the inequality for the season. The employment of both methods puts the accuracy of
the calculations to a very severe test. In fact, to secure agreement to say three
significant figures it is necessary to carry the calculation at least one place further.
This test was not in general applied, but all the calculations were carefully checked,

a special attention being given to any apparent irregularities.
