1 have since found that metallic oxides, such as protoxide of silver, in the presence
of water, all exert the same action on iodide of ethyl; in this case a metallic iodide is
formed, alcohol being reproduced.

The experiment just described shows that, as might haye been expected, the
ethylation cannot be carried on ad infinitum, and that the oxide of tetrethylammo-
nium is the highest term attainable in the ethyl-series. The latter substance con-
tinues to act upon iodide of ethyl, but the change affects solely the iodide of ethyl,
while the base is no longer altered.

The preceding researches are, in themselyes, sufficient to establish the point of
theory which is here in question ; still I hoped to gain a broader basis for raising
general conclusions by collecting some additional facts. The repetition in the
methyl- or amyl-series of an experiment already made in the ethy]-series, resembles, it
is true, the working of a design in blue or green, which has been previously printed
in'red. Nevertheless, irrespectively of the farther elaboration of the theory of homo-
logues, which is still wanted, such experiments lead frequently to new and nnex-
pected observations, which often amply repay the trouble and tediousness of such
inquiries. I therefore made the experiments which yielded the following results ;â€”
