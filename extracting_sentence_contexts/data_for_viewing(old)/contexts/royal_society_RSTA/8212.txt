On substituting from (8) it follows that F must satisfy the equation

Now the solution of the problem of the single infinitely thin semi-infinite plane, deduced
by making «a very small, is obtained from (9) by omitting the third term and the last
two terms upon the left-hand side of that equation. It is, in fact, a first approximation
to the solution which is being sought. The expansion of F which is, accordingly,
suggested is one in ascending powers of cos }(4 — o).

Let us write, momentarily, ;

P = cos" $(b — bo) = wv", say;
we have then
