There was no striking alteration in the
spectrum of the graphite poles, but a careful examination showed that a group of lines
which appear to be caused by the presence of nitrogen was greatly strengthened and
made more prominent. Thess lines or flutings extend from about wave-lengths 3881'8
to 38290. The following facts point to their origin, They are never 8een when
metallic electrodes are used, wet or dry ; they are therefore not air-bauds. They are not
seen when carbon electrodes are immersed in oxygen, and cannot therefore be due to
carbon dioxide. They are always seen when solutions are used with carbon electrodes,
