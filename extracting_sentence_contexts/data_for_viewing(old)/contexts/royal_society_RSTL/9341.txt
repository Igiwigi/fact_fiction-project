are alike. The advocates of the © marine theory” point to the worn and rounded
detrital materials, to the beds of sand and the boulders before alluded to, and to
the numerous local gravel terraces throughout Scotland as evidence of marine agency,
but, their number, their limited range and differences of level, point to the operation
of independent local causes rather than to an uniform general cause 8nch as a sea level,
The phenomena admits also of explanation by land waters and other canses to be men-
tioned hereafter. Professor Nrcor/s* answer relative to the coincidence of the © road”
levels with those of successive cols, which he explains by checked tidal currents,
cannot be considered satisfactory. The improbability, amounting almost to impos-
sibility, of a series of such coincidences as a period of resb concurring with the level
of each col during the general emergence of the land must be apparent.

Further, the fact thab nowhere have marine organisms been found in the drift
ascribed to marine origin, has been urged as an argument against the marine hypo-
thesis. Tt is true that, in loose sand and gravel, shells may have been dissolved out
by the percolation of water; but considering the extent of the debris, the many
sections, and the occasional presence of argillaceous seams, it is difficult, to understand
their absence everywhere. It must, nevertheless, be borne in mind that even in those
low levels, which there is every reason to suppose have been 8ubmerged, marine
remains are very rare (postea, p. 691).+

Mr. Mnxs Home does, however, in a later paper, refer to two finds of 8hells,—
one on the top of Unachan Hill, and the other in a field near Spean Bridge. But the
specimens were not seen by him. Tn both instances they were found near the 8urface,
and directly under the peat, and from the way in which his informant speaks of them,
