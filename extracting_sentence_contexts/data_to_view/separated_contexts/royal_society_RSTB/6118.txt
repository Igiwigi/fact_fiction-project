We
cannot, therefore, use the weight of wild flies to separate unfed newly-emerged
individuals from the others. So far as present knowledge goes, the differences in
chemical composition between newly-emerged and well-nourished flies are not very
great. In both the mean proportion of dry matter is just over 30°, and in spite of
the fact that these insects frequently take their own weight of blood at a meal, the
proportion of dry matter to wet is adjusted in less than four hours after feeding (p. 204). The weight of “ fat’? —ether-soluble material —is about 1 mg in newly-emerged
flies, and after they have fed several times, it rises to between 1-2 and 1-7 mg,
