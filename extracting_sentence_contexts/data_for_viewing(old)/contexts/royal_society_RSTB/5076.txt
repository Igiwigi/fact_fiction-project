The usual cytological fixatives were used. Considerable difficulty was experienced
with certain species, and many collections unfortunately were not useful for the
purpose of this investigation. This was due to the fact that, while anthers in certain
stages appeared to have undergone the various processes of preparation with good
results, others with identical treatment, particularly with the pollen mother cells in
later stages from diakinesis in the heterotype division onwards, were unsatisfactory ;
the chromatin was often clumped and the nuclear contents stained in a hard uniform
manner in which all detail was obscured. Examination showed that the mother cell
wall is usually considerably thickened at these stages. Possibly this hampers the
penetration of the fixative with the result that the fixation is poor. A further difficulty
which has limited the number of species for which results have been obtained is due
to the fact that the sporogenous tissue is sometimes abortive, and in the young flower-
buds this is only brought to light after sectioning.

On the whole, standard and medium strengths of chromacetic gave the most uniformly
good results ; ALLEN’s modification of Bourn’s fixative gave excellent results for some
species but was worthless for others.

Since the idea of the research was to cover a wide range of plants in this Natural
Order, it was obviously not possible to compare in all species the effects of the use of
different fixatives. In one or two instances several fixatives were employed for
comparative purposes. In only few instances was this procedure possible, since in
some species very few flowers are borne on the inflorescence and the time and frequency
of flowering is irregular in cultivation.
