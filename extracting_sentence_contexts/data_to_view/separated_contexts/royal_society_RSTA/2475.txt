This
is quite different to the usual understanding of water infrastructure, the limits of which are
starting to be acknowledged [37,38]. It is not that the values inherent in the experiment with
the stormwater third pipe will never be normal, but rather, they have yet to become normal. The
fact that the third pipe exists at all is a testament to the fact that change is happening and ‘normal’
has already been questioned. The paper, then, analysed an experiment with water infrastructure, not with the intention of
fixing politics, but instead to open or reveal them. A third-pipe stormwater reticulation system
was installed at the Stonefields housing development to harvest runoff and reduce potable water
demand.
