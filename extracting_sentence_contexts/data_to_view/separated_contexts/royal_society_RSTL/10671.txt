Also in other muscles. (See spectrum 7, Chart IV.) In Salamandra maculosd it is present mixed with oxyhamoglobin in the ventricle ;
in traces in the arm and leg muscles and elsewhere in the voluntary musecles,

In the little green tree-frog (7yla arborea) the distribution of myohaematin was
more carefully studied, and here I may observe that its absence must not be concluded
from the fact that the muscle does not show the bands at once. If present in the
oxidised state they may be invisible, 80 that a reducing agent may be necessary to
bring them out. Tn most cases I used sulphide of ammonium in water or STOKEs's
fluid.
