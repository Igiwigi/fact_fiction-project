Mannia* did not open between January 22 and January 29, whereas, in November,
3396, it was well open after 29 hours’ darkness; this was also true of Cineraria
hich in January, 1897, had only begun to open after 48 hours ; similar differences

"8 What the meaning may be of the facts here given is not easy to say. The most
Sbvious analogy is that of nyctitropic plants, in which continuous darkness brings the

Flo not know what is the cause of the analogous behaviour of sleeping leaves. It is,
owever, a classification of the fact that seems to me more satisfactory than the quasi-
anechanical treatment which is often applied to the stoma problem.

As Leirces has done. Het has called attention to the variable result which follows pro-
