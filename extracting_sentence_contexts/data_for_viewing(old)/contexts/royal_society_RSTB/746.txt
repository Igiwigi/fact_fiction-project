become more brittle or more horny, according to circumstances.

In other cases, when in the stages of early development in the fermenting vessels,
the lumps are softer and more viscous than when fully formed; and, in fact, every
transitional stage can be met with from the condition of a slimy, semi-fluid, soft jelly,
to that of a hard horny mass which breaks like glue or cartilage.

These physical characteristics are dependent on the amount of water present
in the lumps.

Obviously the specific gravity of the fresh pieces will vary according to the amount
of water present, also: I have not examined this point in much detail, but the
following facts may be noted. The lumps fall rapidly in alcohol, in distilled water,
and even in Pasrrur’s solution and other media of high specific gravity. Some idea
of the amount of water contained in the lumps may be derived from the following
observation :—On August 27th, I started a culture in a sterilised soda-water flask.
Five grams of the fresh Ginger-beer plant were put in 500 c.c. of Pasteur-Asparagin ;*
on September the 11th the carefully collected crop weighed, fresh, after draining on
filter paper, just over 52°5 grms, This, dried at 100° C. till it lost no more water,
weighed a trifle over 7 grms, Assuming the proportion of water to have been
the same in the original 5 grms., its dry weight would have been ‘66 grm.

Although the fresh dried lumps swell rapidly when placed in water, they do not
dissolve in it, even if boiled ; in fact, heating them in water renders them whiter and
more opaque, much us when they are placed in absolute alcohol, or dried in vacuo,
