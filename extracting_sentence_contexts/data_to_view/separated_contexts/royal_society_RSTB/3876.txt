5 cannot be given, as the young were,not allowed to
grow up. The high death-rate in Generation 4 must not by any means be put down
to the number of parthenogenetic generations which had preceded it, but to unknown
factors of the environment. This is shown by the fact that the death-rate in the

monoclonal population, which had a much longer parthenogenetic ancestry, was much
smaller,

Before beginning the detailed consideration of inheritance within this population it
is necessary to inquire into its “homogeneity.” It is of course heterogeneous in the
sense that it is composed of 62 clones, but is the population as a whole homogeneous
in the statistical sense, consisting of a mass of individuals distributed round the mean
roughly in a normal curve of distribution, or can it be divided into two or more groups
which must be considered separately?
