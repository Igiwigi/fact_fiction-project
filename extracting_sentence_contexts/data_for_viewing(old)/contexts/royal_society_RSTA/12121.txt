Substances which have no, or only a slight, tendency to associate simple to complex _
molecules, however, such as naphthalene (molecular weight, 128), show no such large
deviations, even in a concentrated solution. Thus BeckmMANN found the molec
weight of naphthalene to be 132, even when 20°5 per cent. of naphthalene wa

dissolved in benzene,

That such abnormal results are not unknown, even in the gaseous state, is proved —
by the density of sulphur vapour at temperatures not far removed from its boiling-
point under normal pressure ; Brirz’s results (‘Zeitschr. Phys. Chem.,’ vol.2, p.920) sho
that whether the formula be accepted as S,, or whether the association be regarded @
proceeding to an indefinite limit, the fact remains that association takes place will
full of temperature. (See also THorPE and HampBty’s results with hydrogen fluorid
‘Chem. Soc. Trans.,’ vol. 55, p. 163.)

As to the reason of such condensation, it is, perhaps, premature to speak, A recent
paper on Valency, by Fravirzxy (‘J. Prakt. Chem.,’ N.F., vol. 46, p. 57), however
appears to suggest a clue. It may be that the oxygen in such molecules as acetié
acid and the alcohols has not exerted its maximum valency, on account of the com
paratively high temperature, and the distance between the molecules when alcohol
in the gaseous state ; and that valency increases either with fall of temperature,
with closer approach between the molecules,

A further proof that association is furthered by the liquid condition has be
