The absence or presence of such correlation
determines whether the variance would follow the normal law or would decrease more
slowly with increasing size of grids. In fact, this furnishes a convenient basis for the classi-
fication of fields into two distinct types, namely, (a) random type (in which the variance
function is normal) and (4) non-random type (in which the variance decreases more slowly). The theoretical formulation is given in Part II; the point to be emphasized is that this is
based not on speculative grounds but on experimental evidence and on the fact that such
classifications lead to economy in the planning of sample surveys.

31. Cost of operations. From the very beginning both field and statistical workers were
asked to keep daily records of the time spent on different types of work.
