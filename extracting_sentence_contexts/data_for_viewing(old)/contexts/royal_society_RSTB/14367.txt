Finally, the disproportionate evolution in primate brains
has occurred in the neocortex and specifically the frontal
cortex, a region most closely associated with emotional regu-
lation, social skills and executive function [61]. This in itself
suggests that primate brain size is not the result of evolution
for a specific task, but rather a generalized response to a
range of cognitive challenges. Taking a more systems-based
perspective helps to explain why so many different variables
correlate with brain size, and makes it possible to place these
relationships into a single framework that allows us to see
how they articulate with each other. It may also, we suggest,
allow us to see relationships that simpler analyses fail to
notice—for example, the fact that diet (or foraging skills)
exists in an endogenous rachet with brain size, whereas
group size (or at least the behaviours that this depends on)
is part of a linear causal cascade.
