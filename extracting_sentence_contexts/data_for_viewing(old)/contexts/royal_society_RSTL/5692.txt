Graphite No. 1 is the $0-called pure Ceylon, No. 3 the purified German, and No, 2
a mixture of both, all used for making pencils. 'The specimens were purified by Bnoviy's
patent, and pressed by Mr. CARTMELL, to whom I am indebted for the same. These, as
well as the gas-coke and BuxseN's battery-coke, were shaped into thin rods by hand,
and the ends coppered galvanoplastically.

To form the connexion in order to determine their conducting powers, one end stood
in a cup of quicksilyer, the other cup being formed by placing an india-rubber tubing
over the other end, the latter cup being of course also filled with quicksilver. As the
rods were made by hand, the difference in the results of the same specimens is thus
accounted for.

An interesting fact was now observed, viz. that in all the cokes and graphites the con»
ducting power increased by heat. Some experiments were made with gas-coke, and it
was found that if at 0* the conducting power equalled 100, it, from 0* to 140?, increased
000245 for each degree, and between the common temperature and a light red heat,
about 12 per cent.

For these experiments the connecting copper wires were soldered on to the coppered
ends of the rods. The red phosphorus was likewise coppered galvanoplastically, and the
values determined after the same method.

The following metals were chemically pure :—Silyer, gold, zinc, cadmium, tin, lead,
antimony, quicksilver, bixmuth, tellurium ; and the undermentioned pressed, viz. sodium,
zinc, magnesinm, calcium, cadmium, potassium, tin, lead, strontium, antimony, bismuth,
