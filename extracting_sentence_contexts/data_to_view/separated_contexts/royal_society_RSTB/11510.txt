But these measures do not amount to
correctness conditions. One might consider a probability dis-
tribution correct just in case the hypothesis to which it assigns
the highest value is correct. But, first, this threatens to treat
the probabilistic representation as, in fact, a representation
of just that hypothesis. Second, some theories of represen-
tational content take how a representation is used to
partially determine its content [69]. But not all models use
decision rules that extract the item assigned highest credence.
(In principle, the same representation may be subject to
different decision rules by different computations.)

Suppose probabilistic representations do not so much as
have correctness conditions (unlike the representations they
embed).
