The centroid having been found, it may be asked : Why we should not calculate
Has Ps, Has #; directly ? The answer lies in the fact that the centroid will not generally
coincide with a unit division on the deviation axis, and the powers to be calculated,
instead of being those of two place figures, become in general powers of numbers
containing three or four figures. Thus the labour of the arithmetic is much increased.

(b.) Graphically.—If the figure be drawn on a large scale, the moments may be
found with a fair degree of accuracy by aid of the following process, which has long
been of use in graphical statics for finding the first, second, and third moments of
plane areas.*

It is required to find the moments about O’y' of the curve ABC, bounded by the
straight line O'CA. Take O”y” parallel to O’y' and at distance 4. Take any line
PP’, first to O'y’ from AC to ABC; let the perpendicular from P’ on Oy” meet it
