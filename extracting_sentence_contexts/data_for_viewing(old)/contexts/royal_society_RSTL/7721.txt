CHAPTER 111,

(73) Although in the course of these researches I have carefully endeayoured +
investigate the facts independently of any particular physiological views with which
they might seem to be connected, I shall nevertheless conclude this memoir with a few
remarks on some of the physiological and pathological points which they either modi fy
or explain. :

(74) Before the publication of my memoir © On the Medulla Oblongata,” in 1858, j
was believed by anatomists that the decussating fibres of the anterior pyramids are con
tinuous only with the lateral columns of the opposite side of the spinal cord. T haye
shown, however, that they are connected not only with the 7ateral, but with the anterior
columns, and with both the anterior and posterior grey s#6stance. These facts, which
must modify to a certain extent the current opinion concerning the functions of the
anterior pyramids, have been confirmed by the investigations of M. VULPiax, announced
in his recent and valuable work on the © Physiology of the Nervous System*. © Nog
recherches anatomiques, d'accord en grande partie avec celles de M. LoCknarr CLARKE
montrent que les pyramides ant&rieures sont form6es par des fibres 6mandGes: (1) des
faisceaux anterieurs ; (2) des faisceaux latcraux ; (3) des faisceaux postcrieurs ; (4) dela
8ubstance grise de la moelle 6piniere. A ces fibres, il faut meme en ajouter dautres
qui font partie du groupe des fibres arciformes, et, qui constituent parfois, soit Yun senl
cots, soit, mais plus rarement, des deux cot6s du bulbe, une portion assez notable de la
pyramide anterieureF.”

(75) Besides the antero-lateral white columns, the particular parts with which I have
