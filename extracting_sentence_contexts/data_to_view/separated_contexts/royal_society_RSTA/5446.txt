They are used in experiments with animals and
deep brain stimulation, and in some trials for reducing symptoms of Parkinson disease.

augmentation. Brain-computer interfaces are also being used, most of the time in communication
from the brain to a machine like controlling a robotic arm.”

Even without taking into consideration ‘potential’ but science fiction-like technologies, the
trend towards human augmentation is accelerating. Natural language interfaces on the one
side and the growing capabilities of machines to interpret the context including image/gesture
recognition, emotion detection, singling out of a voice among several are accelerating the seamless
cooperation of humans and machines and eventually result in the birth of a symbiotic system,
what has been called by the SAS initiative symbiotic autonomous systems.
