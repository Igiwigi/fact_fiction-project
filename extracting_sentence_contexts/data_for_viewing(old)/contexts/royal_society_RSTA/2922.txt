that cannot be inferred unless his or her information were used in the analysis). Suppose a
research study explores the effects of wine drinking in 60-year-old women and finds a strong
positive correlation between wine drinking and kidney disease that was not known to exist before
the study was conducted. If one knows that Gertrude is a 60-year-old woman and that she is a
regular wine drinker, the results of the study can be used to better estimate whether Gertrude
suffers from kidney disease than before the study was conducted. The release of the study’s
results, therefore, does not satisfy semantic security. Further research extends these examples and
generalizes them in a formal mathematical argument that making semantic security a requirement
in data analysis would essentially prohibit the discovery of any new knowledge through research =
using personal data [29]. : 3S

The discussion above should not be understood to undermine the importance of cryptographic
notions such as semantic security to privacy. In fact, modern cryptographic methods such as mea)
secure multiparty computation [30] and homomorphic encryption [31] extend the notion of :
semantic security to settings in which several parties (each holding a private input) compute a [4
function f() of their joint data without having to reveal any information beyond what is revealed DO
at the conclusion of the following ‘ideal’ (imaginary) process: a fully trusted party collects the data a
from all the parties, computes f(), informs each party of her designated part of f(), and erases the ae
entire process from its memory. Such cryptographic approaches are now beginning to be deployed .
in real-world settings, such as personalized medicine [32].

(iii) Formal privacy models and differential privacy

Failures of traditional privacy-preserving approaches to control disclosure risks in statistical
publications have motivated computer scientists to develop a strong, formal approach to privacy.
