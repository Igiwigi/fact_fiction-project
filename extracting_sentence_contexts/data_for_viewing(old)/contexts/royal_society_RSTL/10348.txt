there had been a period in the life of the cell when the protoplasm had required to
get rid of some of the calcium oxalate resulting from the metabolic activity of the
protoplasm. This was consequently thrown down in the form of a crystal which
adhered to the cell wall, and in the subsequent thickening which occurred, was
gradually covered in until it was at length s8urrounded on all sides by the cellulose.

Lodoicea sechellarum is of interest, nob only as affording one of the clearest
examples of the perforation both of the wall and pit membrane, but also because of
its very unique distribution (Plate 69, fig. 19).

In Oncosperma the threads are excessively fine, and certainly snggest the extreme
probability of the existence of threads which are 80 delicate as to be invisible (Plate
69, fig. 21). In fact, I am inclined to believe that this really is 80 in 8nch endosperms
as Cocos nucifera. To this 8eed Martinezia caryctifolia presents a useful transition.
With iodine it can be een that very fine threads do go through the almost 8mooth
walls, but upon treatment with picric-Hormanx's-blue the individual threads cannot
be distinguished, and only a blue coloration occurs. In Cocos, which has essentially
the same structure, T was unable to observe threads, though T cannot doubt that 8uch
threads do exist. In all the Cocoinee the walls are thin and must be carefully
examined. They are, however, of extreme value, both from the point of view of
analogy and comparison. In Syagrus (Plate 69, fig. 25) and Desmoneus the threads
are well seen. eterospathe elata is a particularly favourable endosperm for
demonstrating the perforation of the middle lamella, which here is but little
developed (Plate 69, figs. 22 and 23). The threads appear very clearly with iodine.
In Phytelephas, although the walls are extremely thick the pits are 8mall, the pit
