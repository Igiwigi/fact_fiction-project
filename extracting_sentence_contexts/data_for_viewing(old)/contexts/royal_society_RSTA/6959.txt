In later sections methods are described by which the double boundary condition of type
(I. 8) isintroduced and satisfied. The form of the difference correction to be added to equation
(B.1) to make it a more accurate representation of the differential equation is also ascer-
tained.

First, however, some explanation is required of the difficulty experienced by computers
in applying relaxation methods to the set of simultaneous equations typified by (B. 1). The
difficulties are undoubtedly real, and arise from the fact that these equations, particularly
when a large number is involved, are of the type called ‘ill-conditioned’. Substantial
changes can be made in the unknowns without altering appreciably the residuals, and great
care is therefore needed to obtain accurate results.

The phenomenon is well known to computers who solve linear equations by direct methods,
and to users of standard iterative procedures, but appears to have received little attention
from workers in relaxation methods. The present writer (Fox 1947 a, 1948) has already drawn
attention to it in connexion with the relaxation of ordinary differential equations and partial
differential equations of the second order. Indeed, the desire to restrict to a minimum the
