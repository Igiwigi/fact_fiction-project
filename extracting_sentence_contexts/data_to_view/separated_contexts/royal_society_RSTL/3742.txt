At first there was no action, but after about fifteen mi-
nutes, a slight action was perceptible; this gradually increased, and in two hours the
action was equal to that of the battery which had been from the first exposed to the
atmosphere. I cannot but regard this experiment as a conclusive negation of that
view which regards hydrogen and water as the efficient agents in the gas battery. The
opinion appears to me to have arisen from the circumstance of our working always
in an atmosphere containing oxygen, and also from the fact of this latter gas being
more s0luble than hydrogen*. If we lived in an atmosphere of hydrogen, and if this
gas were equally or more soluble than oxygen, I have little doubt that the converse
effects would be observed. A battery charged with hydrogen in one set of tubes and
acidulated water in the alternate ones, at first gives an effect nearly equal to an oxy-
hydrogen gas battery, but the action rapidly declines in the former, while it is con-
stant in the latter.
