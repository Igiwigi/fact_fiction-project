3 â€”Five eggs were placed in separate cells, and marked, as above directed,
and then removed to a high temperature. March 26. The results obtained from these were confirmatory of the facts before
stated, as the variation between the line and the axis of the beings was only slight ;
the axis of two being directed to the right, one to the left, and one perfectly coin-
ciding. Although these observations have shown that the axis of the body of the future
embryo corresponds primarily with the first cleft in the yelk, they point out that, at
times, the axis deviates to the left or right of that line. The cause of this deviation
I may attribute to a change in the position of the yelk, for on March 29, 1853, I
observed that the entire yelk occasionally shifts its position during the progress of
segmentation, in consequence probably of unsymmetrical division, in accordance
with the explanation before given at page 240,

tion of the first cleft of the Felk.
