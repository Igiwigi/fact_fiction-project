2. The facial expression of pain

Facial expressions are a powerful social communication’ and have been studied
for several decades in humans [4,9,10]. Pain research has mainly used methods
developed in emotion research such as the Facial Action Coding System (FACS;
[11,12]), enabling trained researchers to code over 40 distinct muscle move-
ments. Prototypical movements, the so-called Action Units, were found by
some research groups, not only for what are regarded as ‘basic emotions’,
such as happiness, anger, sadness, surprise, fear and disgust ([13]; for a critical
view of the concept of basic emotions, see e.g. [14]). Prototypical facial move-
ments were also found for further emotional experiences, including pain [15].
A facial expression of pain in humans is characterized by lowering of the eye-
brows, squeezing of the eyes, wrinkling of the nose, raising of the upper lip and
opening of the mouth [4]. Observers of human pain facial expressions were able
to reliably distinguish pain from a variety of other facial expressions [15-17]. In
humans, this pain face is consistently displayed across ages in experimental as
well as clinical settings [15]. Despite some differences between humans and
