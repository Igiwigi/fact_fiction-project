The Movements of the Surface Waters. The detailed description of the charts has shown that while considerable variations
of an irregular type occur, there are nevertheless changes over the whole area
covered which evidently represent a continuous sequence. The charts for each
month differ from those for the months immediately preceding and following in such
a way as to form a satisfactory intermediate step between the two: they tell, in fact,
an intelligible story about the distribution of both temperature and salinity, showing
progressive changes bearing certain relations to each other, having certain seasonal
phases which occur in both years, and certain features in which the one year differs
materially from the other. The important point is accordingly established, that the
method employed is adequate to its purpose. Hence, without employing special ships
or observers, a continuous survey of the surface changes in the North Atlantic could
be kept up with comparatively little trouble or expense: a much larger number or
observations than I was able to deal with could be obtained, worked up, and charted
for about Â£300 a year.
