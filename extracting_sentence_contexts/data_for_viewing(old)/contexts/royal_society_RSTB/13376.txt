The squamate SSK may derive from an ancestral con-
dition shared with fish and amphibians [45], and it may be
homologous to the mammalian seminal vesicles or prostate
[46]. In snakes, the SSK can represent 60-85% of kidney
mass [43, table 11.2]. Thus, the SSK is an attractive, but
under-studied, evolutionary model of accessory sex glands.

Seminal fluids may enhance sperm movement and viabi-
lity, protect paternity or impede rival ejaculates [14].
However, using vasectomized (i.e. SSK secretions only, no
sperm) sand lizards (Lacerta agilis), Olsson et al. [26] showed
that seminal fluid itself does not reduce rival males’ pater-
nity; in fact, females first mated to a vasectomized male
had higher fertility. In the only study to test for effects of rep-
tilian seminal fluid on sperm motility or velocity, Cuellar et al.
[47] demonstrated that anole lizard seminal fluid sustains
and activates sperm. Accessory gland proteins like those in
Drosophila [48] have not been described in squamates. How-
ever, garter snake seminal fluid has prostaglandins [49] that
may affect female receptivity, ovulation or egg production
[50]. Female garter snakes that mated with vasectomized
males’ SSK secretions only (no sperm) remated at greater
rates than females mated with intact males [20], suggesting
CPs do not contain anti-aphrodisiacs but may still affect
ovulation and female fecundity.
