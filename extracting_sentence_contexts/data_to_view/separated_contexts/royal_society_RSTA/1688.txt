Then A = A? where By = B\x, =@ is bounded, ie.
we are in the situation of §5d(i). First, we verify the assumption 5.7. In fact, Ag = 4, D(Ao) = (f € Cl([=1, 0], Y) : (0) =0} has
empty spectrum and its resolvent is given by

0
(RG, AoA) =| e-Of(@)ds, re [1,0] 2€C. For A > 0, this implies
0 5
2+ |(RQ Ao) f)()| <| re) ds. |Ifl| <IIf||_ for all r €[—1,0],
r

ie. Ag is a weak Hille-Yosida operator.
