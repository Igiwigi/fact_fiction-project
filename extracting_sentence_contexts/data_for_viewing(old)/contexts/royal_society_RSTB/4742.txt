quantity of black pigment. Sections were made through several feathers, among
them those of a bright green humming-bird. The sections were stained in picric
acid, which usually revealed a cuticle, the amount of pigment in which depended
upon the thickness of the section. Plate 2, fig. 21, represents a section through
four barbules of the iridescent green portion of a widgeon’s feather. The oval-
shaped section of the barbule’ was cut near the tip, the other three were cut
lower down, close to where they are joined to the central barb. They show a
cuticle, c, and are all heavily pigmented with black pigment, which is sometimes
granular, as at p, and sometimes diffused. Sections were also made from an adjacent
portion of the same feather, which was dull black, but, after staining in picric acid,
no distinction could be made between the two. From the appearance of these
sections, it would seem that the colour-producing structure was more nearly allied
to that of scaleless beetles than any other described, but, owing to the fact that the
colour disappears or changes on pressure, it is more likely that it depends in some
way “on the interference of thin plates.”{ It is, however, hoped that a further
investigation will be made of feathers and certain other iridescent structures.

A brief examination was made of a few miscellaneous objects which show iridescence.
In the vegetable kingdom the phenomenon is very rare, and has been noticed in
some seeds such as those of the Peony, where it is said to be due to a pigment
which dissolves in alcohol, giving a brown fluid with a blue fluorescence.{  Pteri-
dophytes of the genus Selaginella sometimes show strong iridescent colours. ‘Two
Species were investigated by Kyy,§ who came to the conclusion that the colour was
due to the surface cuticle, although he admits that this is only a little less than
