earth’s surface, and this rules out the possibility of using any simple approximation of the
Huygens-Kirchhoff type. On the other hand, as described below, an exact method of
solution is available in which it is convenient to preserve the concepts of a ‘geometrical
optics’ field and a ‘diffraction’ field. In figure 4, 7” is the image of Tin the earth’s surface,
and /is the point at infinity on 7’O produced; by definition, the geometrical optics field in
the free-space region to the left of O/ is that which would obtain for a homogeneous earth
of medium 1; in the region to the right of O/, that which would obtain for a homogeneous
perfectly conducting earth; the residue of the total field is the diffraction field, which, in
particular, has a discontinuity across O/ counterbalancing that of the geometrical optics
field. A diffre

ction field can often be interpreted as arising from a fictitious source located

the boundary, although it cannot be conceived in terms of a line-source at O for positions of
the receiver as close to OJ as those with which we are concerned; for these positions the
diffraction term is comparable with that of geometrical optics, and its evaluation forms the

It is evident that the mathematics of our problem must represent a fusion of (exact
diffraction theory and propagation theory. The fundamental contribution in each of these
fields was made by Sommerfeld, but the methods originally used bear no relation to one
another and cannot be readily generalized in the way which we require. On the other hand,
