We know also that in human dentine many tubes terminate at
the enamel margin in broad ends, so much so that it suggested to Prof. von Esnerr,
Prof. WALKHoFF, and others, that there must have been a resorption of the first
deposited dentine. In Plate 26, fig. 6, it is also seen with a low magnifying power that the calcification
of the enamel is incomplete all along the junction line, as in fig. 4, and I think this
fact has a strong bearing upon the question of the nature of the tubes in the enamel. The large scattered calcifying globules are seen in this position (Plate 26, fig. 7),
although the calcification of the prisms, as evidenced by the regular rows of deposit
in their substance, is very evident. This line of isolated globular bodies at the
dentine margin is seen in many sections.
