cessive discharges rather resemble those of a yoltaic arrangement, intermitting
in its action, than those of a Leyden apparatus, charged and discharged many
times in succession, In reality, however, there is no philosophical difference be-
tween these two cages.

360. The general conclusion which must, I think, be drawn from this col-
lection of facts is, that electricity, whatever may be its $0urce, is identical in its
nature. The phenomena in the five kinds or species quoted, differ not in their
character, but only in degree; and in that respect vary in proportion to the
variable circumstances of quantity and intensity * which can at pleasure be
made to change in almost any one of the kinds of electricity, as much as it
does between one kind and another. Table of the experimental Effects common to the Electricities derived from
different Sources.
