future warmer, moister environments [22], elevating temperature-driven flood risks. Temperature
increases are thus occurring more rapidly than previously expected, and we conclude that this
driver of urban flood risk has strengthened.

(c) Climate change: relative sea-level rise

Rates of mean sea-level rise, at approximately 1.4mmyr~! from the start of the twentieth
century [3], have remained relatively constant and within the uncertainty band for this driver.
Nonetheless, relative sea-level rise could become a more significant future driver of flood risk in
parts of the country subject to subsidence. For example, based on UKCP18 projections, sea-level
in the Thames Estuary in 2100 could rise by between 29 and 70cm (low emissions scenario) and.
by between 53 and 115 cm (high emissions scenario), increasing flood risk to London more than
was envisaged in 2008 [14]. The seriousness of the situation is illustrated by the fact that 200 km of
coastal defences would be highly vulnerable to failure if relative sea level rose by 0.5 m (equivalent
to the sea-level rise associated with a 4Â°C increase in global mean temperature) [20]. Nationally,
however, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that relative sea-level rise as a driver of urban
flood risk has increased significantly in intensity since 2008.
