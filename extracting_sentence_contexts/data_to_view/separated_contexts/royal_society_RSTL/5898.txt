Sould have been produced, differing empirically from iodide of distanethyl only by
taint one additional equivalent of hydrogen ; but the formula of the former body

uires 15-81 per cent. of carbon and 3-62 per cent. of hydrogen ; and although these
numbers are not altogether incompatible with the results of the above analyses, yet the
fact of the production of iodide of methyl in the reaction is utterly irreconcileable with
the formation of snch a compound. Todide of distanethyl has already been examined
both by M. Low1G and by MM. Canovrs and Ricns; but as the descriptions of these
chemists are 80 little in harmony with each other, it is impossible to make use of them
for the identification of the body obtained in the above reaction.
