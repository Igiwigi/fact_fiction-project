Going from the 180° fields of the larval eye of

Platynereis dumerilii (figure 1b; Jékely et al. 2008) to a
25° degree field in a small pigment-cup eye
(figure 1d) involves a 42 times reduction in photon

obstacle in the evolution of spatial vision. The problem

is compounded by the fact that the integration time
