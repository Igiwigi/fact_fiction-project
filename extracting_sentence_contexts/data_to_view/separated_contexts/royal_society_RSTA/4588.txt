The stable section (a) of the equilibrium branch represents circular trajectories of the aircraft,
where the radius of the circle decreases as the steering angle is increased. The saddle-node
bifurcation at 5 * 28Â° marks the loss of stability of the turn. In fact, as indicated by (b), for
a steering angle 6 past this point, the aircraft loses control without warning. Analysis of the
state variables reveals that the tyres of the inner main gear saturate and the load is shifted
to the outer main gear. The tyres of the outer main gear then saturate with an accompanying
load redistribution to the nose and inner gears.
