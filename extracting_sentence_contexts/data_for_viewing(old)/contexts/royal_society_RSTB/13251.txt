of a stimulus;

(4) Generalization, the ability to confer value in a new
context owing to memory and learning;

(5) Global coordination, the tendency of emotion states to
induce widespread changes in the whole organism;

(6) Automaticity, the fact that emotion states exist some-
where between reflexes and deliberate actions, and their
potency typically trumps deliberate acts; and

(7) Social communication, the fact that emotion states, or
elements of their expression (e.g. facial and/or other
bodily movements), seem to be ‘pre-adapted to serve
as social communicative signals’.

Without some such innate basis, there would be nothing to
ground valence, nothing upon which learned associations
could build. Those innate representations of valence, in turn,
would not have been selected in evolution if they did not
afford the species a survival advantage.
