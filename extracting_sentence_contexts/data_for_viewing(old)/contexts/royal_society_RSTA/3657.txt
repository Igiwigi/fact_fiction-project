Figure 10. Zoning profiles for olivine grains from (type IIA, porphyritic olivine (PO)) chondrule 1. Positions of profiles are
illustrated in [51, fig. 1h]. (a) Profile from core to edge of a normal zoned olivine grain, showing characteristics of growth during
igneous crystallization from the chondrule melt. (6) Profile across the boundary between relic grain 1 and its igneous overgrowth.
The mean composition of the core of the relic grain 1 is indicated on the left of the plot (reproduced with permission from

correlation line (Fe/Mn~ 44), which manifests as a slight vertical smearing of the correlation
[262,263]. That is, zoning tends to vertically smear the Fe/Mn correlation.

The fact that zoning causes slight modifications in the Fe/Mn ratio means that zoning does
not move chondrule olivine out of regimes corresponding to that chondrite class. Hence, the
discrimination between different carbonaceous chondrite classes in the Fe-Mn plot are due
to significant differences in precursor composition or oxygen fugacity, meaning that there are
distinguishable reservoirs and physical conditions that pertain to distinct chondrite classes [262,
263]. The addition of MnO (by condensation) during crystallization is the favoured explanation
for zoning in CR type II chondrules (§5e).

(e) CR chondrule olivine

Next, we embark on explaining the wide range of the Fe—-Mn relation that is occupied by type II
olivine grains in CR chondrites because CR and Stardust both occupy broad regions in the Fe-Mn
plot. A note of interest is that CR chondrules have been age-dated at ~3 Myr and so represent
