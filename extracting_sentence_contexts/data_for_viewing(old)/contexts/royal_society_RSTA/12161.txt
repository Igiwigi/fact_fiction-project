steady current can be realized in a conductor devoid of resistance, without the aid
of any complicated electromotive source.*

47. Now we have to inquire what account the dynamical theory gives of this
steady current. In the first place, the motion is very slow in comparison with the
velocity of electric propagation ; therefore the interior of the dielectric is at each
instant sensibly in an equilibrium condition, for the same kind of reason that moving
a body slowly to and fro does not start any appreciable sound waves in the
atmosphere. Thus at each instant the vector (f, g, h) is derived as above from a

lotential function V ; and at the surface of any of the conductors (supposed here of
sensible resistance) it is directed along the normal, if the medium is isotropic. It
4, in fact, in the more familiar electric language, at each instant the electric displace-
dent determined by the charges which exist in a state of equilibrium on the faces of

Bhe condensers and on the connecting wires. This electric displacement in the
dliclectric field is, owing to the condensing action, very small compared with the
Pharges involved, except between the plates of the condensers and close to the thin
nducting wire. Imagine a closed surface which passes between the plates of one
at the condensers, and intersects the conducting wire at a place P.- As the vector
(Ag, h) is by its nature as a rotation circuital, its total flux through any surface must
be null, if we imagine the elastic continuity of the medium inside the conductors to
be restored, and such an electric displacement at the same time imparted along the
Wire as will leave the state of the field unaltered and thus no disturbance inside
the conductors. And this flux must remain null when the plates of the condenser
