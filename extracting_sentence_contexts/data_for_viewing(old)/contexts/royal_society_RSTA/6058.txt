term coefficient would be just q%,. That is not what arises from the transverse-space integrals,
however. Instead, what one finds involves na =1-(6/20?)4 dy). This is the phenomenon of
covert symmetry breaking: no mass generation occurs as in a standard Higgs mechanism, but
symmetry breaking in higher couplings, starting at quartic order in fields, does.

Of course, if one keeps all gauge and scalar modes, the full D=5 theory is retained and no
symmetry breaking occurs. But this D=5 U(1) symmetry mixes the various gauge and scalar
field mode levels in a complicated way. Covert symmetry breaking is intrinsically a phenomenon
related to a low-energy approximation, in which the massive higher modes are not independently
excited, but are integrated out using the leading-order results of their field equations.

That such a phenomenon can occur starting at quartic order may be expected on general
grounds, as well as the fact that when it does occur, it cannot be fully remedied by field
redefinitions [8]. What can be altered by field redefinitions, however, is the presentation of the
phenomenon. The leading-order effective theory is obtained by integrating out all higher massive
modes. For the gauge-field sector, that process is unambiguous when one restricts attention
to the leading €=0 modes. For the complex scalar, however, some rearrangement is possible.
Integrating out massive modes at leading order basically involves discarding derivatives of sucha
mode in its field equation, but keeping the mass term in what then becomes an algebraic equation
at leading order, solving for the mode in question. Field redefinitions involving the Stueckelberg

1These terms are called ‘seagulls’ as they generate interactions between the particles corresponding to the gauge field and
scalar that look diagrammatically like a seagull.
