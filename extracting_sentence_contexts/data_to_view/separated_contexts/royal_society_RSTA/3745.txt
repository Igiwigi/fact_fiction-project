We first separate the linear terms from the nonlinear terms and consider the latter terms,
together with unclosed expressions (triple averages), as a generic driving term of the linear
evolution equation for 7;. This separation precedes our ignoring the driving term, because we
are principally interested in the parts of 7; responding to the coherent motion i/;. This procedural
(linearization) step can further be justified by recalling the fact that the portion of 7; which
responds to a vanishing nonlinear driving term is uncorrelated to i;. Further simplifications can be made by invoking boundary-layer assumptions, thus tailoring
our analysis to the near-wall region of turbulent flows. In particular, the standard observation
of the streamwise velocity component dominating over the velocity components along the
remaining coordinate directions, together with its predominant variation in the wall-normal
direction, yields u = u(y) and {v, w} = 0.
