the underlying memory trace. As explained below, the theory
of ‘reconsolidation’ states that memories are not necessa-
rily permanent [47-49], but can be updated, reduced or
enhanced, under the right circumstances. As we shall discuss,
this has inspired a whole new line of research looking at how
the plasticity of memories can be used to modify clinically
dysfunctional memories. But what exactly do we mean by
‘emotional memory’?

3. How to define emotional memory and targets
for clinical interventions?

Studying memory is complicated by the fact that we cannot
directly observe a memory trace, but have to infer it from the
different ways it is expressed. In memory research, a variety
of behavioural measures provide different ‘read-outs’ of infor-
mation that has been stored, for example neural responses,
peripheral physiology, actions or action tendencies, (subjec-
tive) verbal reports or explicit tests of memory. These
responses are thought to be indices of some sort of underly-
ing neural ‘engram’, the memory trace, which supports
these responses. While in many situations different read-outs
converge, below we argue that a distinction between multi-
ple memory systems is useful and paramount to making
translational progress.
