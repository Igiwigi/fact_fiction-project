those of the Caytoniales, and with spores which have been found in beds of Lower
Beaufort or Upper Keca age.

13. The form of the type species of Pteruchus is essentially similar to that of the
Paleozoic genus Crossotheca, while other species approach the type formerly known as
Potoniea. Comparable forms have also been described from the Triassic beds of
Australia.

14. A preliminary survey of the leaves associated with the reproductive structures
indicates that the forms from the Southern Hemisphere known as Dicroidium, “ Steno-
pteris,”’ Pachypteris, and probably Johnstonia are to be regarded as the leaves of the
Corystospermacese. This view is based mainly on the study of the gymnospermous
cuticles of these forms and also on the facts of association.

15. A new species of Lepidopteris, nearly related to Lepidopleris Ottonis of Greenland
and other Triassic localities in Kurope, is described with its seed-bearing branches. The
family Peltaspermacez is instituted for the reception of this form.

16. The morphological significance of these discoveries is considered. It is suggested
that gymnospermous seeds must be regarded as terminal structures formed at the ends
of branches, and not as marginal structures borne on a typical foliar organ. The frequent
use of the term sporophyll as applied to the seed plants is considered to be misleading.
The seed bearing organs of all other gymnosperms can be considered as derived from
structures somewhat similar to those of the Corystospermacee, and traces of a cupule can
be detected in all the major groups.
