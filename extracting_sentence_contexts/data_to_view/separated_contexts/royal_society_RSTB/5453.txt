For our present purpose
it is enough to recognise how these existing types of small-leaved Pteridophyta, in
contrast with the megaphyllous groups, indicate the problem on which historical
evidence from the fossil record is desirable. The interest of Thursophyton and Asteroxylon is, as was pointed out above, that their
appendages are comparable on the one hand to definite small leaves and on the other to
emergences such as those of Psilophyton. In all cases our knowledge of the facts is
incomplete and needs to be critically extended. No structural details are available
regarding the appendages borne by Asteroxylon elberfeldense from the Middle Devonian
of Germany (KrAvuset and WryLanp, 1923, 1926, 1929). It is of interest that the lower
part of the erect shoot of this plant has been compared with Thursophyton and a higher
region of the branch-system with Psilophyton.
