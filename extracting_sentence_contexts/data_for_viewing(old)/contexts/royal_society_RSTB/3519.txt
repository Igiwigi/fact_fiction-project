sense, as described in our former paper.

As we there stated, no other embryonic differentiation was discovered during
examination of the blastoderm i toto, nor had we at that time any reason to suspect
the existence of any such differentiation. But the subsequent examination of the
serial sections showed that, at some distance from the knot, there existed an area ot
considerable extent over which the ectoderm was thickened; and throughout which
there ran a linear primitive streak, from whose margins a mesodermal sheet already
extended outwards for a considerable distance.

Specimen D was the twin egg of Specimen DD, with which it was practically
identical in size, measuring 9 millims. in diameter. In it the region of the primitive
knot was easily recognisable, being rendered abnormally obvious by the fact that an
extrusion of yolk had taken place at the knot from the interior of the vesicle. The
extruded yolk formed a small bulging beneath the vitelline membrane, and must
have oceurred during fixation.*

Here again, in this specimen, no further trace of embryonic differentiation was
discovered during careful examination of the portions of the opened egg viewed
in toto, in apposition with the shell, under moderate magnification. Nevertheless, as
in the case of the sister-egg, the serial sections later showed that, at some distance
from the primitive knot, a primitive streak traversing an area of thickened ectoderm,
and a proliferating mesodermal sheet, were also present.

The surface examination of the blastoderm of both of these specimens was carried
