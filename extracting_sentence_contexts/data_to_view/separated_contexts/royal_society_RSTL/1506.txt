The germen was more sluggish ; but it rarely or
never failed to change its direction in the course of twenty-
four hours ;. and all my efforts to make it grow downwards,
by slightly changing its direction, were invariably abortive. Another, and apparently a more weighty, objection to the
preceding hypothesis, (if applied to the subsequent growth
and forms of trees,) arises from the facts that few of their
branches rise perpendicularly upwards, and that their roots
always spread horizontally ; but this objection I think may
be readily answered. The luxuriant shoots of trees, which abound in sap, in
whatever direction they are first protruded, almost uniformly
turn upwards, and endeavour to acquire a perpendicular di-
rection ; and to this their points will immediately return, if
they are bent downwards during any period of their growth;
their curvature upwards being occasjoned by an increased
extension of the fibres and vessels of their under sides, as in
the elongated germens of seeds. The more feeble and slender
shoots of the same trees will, on the contrary, grow in almost
every direction, probably because their fibres, being more
dry, and their vessels less amply supplied with sap, they are
