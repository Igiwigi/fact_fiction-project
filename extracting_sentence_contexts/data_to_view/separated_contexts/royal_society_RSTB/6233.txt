Source of material—Type colony in British Museum, from the Challenger
Expedition near Kerguelen Islands. Remarks—The type colony alone is in good condition and available for examina-
tion ; and the mere fact that the majority of zooids within the colony are distended
with developing embryos precludes any possibility of obtaining more than a
fragmentary view of the process of budding, for sexual and asexual modes of repro-
duction are not mutually compatible. There is some evidence, however, that the
colony in question was taken near the end of the sexual breeding season, with a few
zooids entering the asexual phase. The zooids are smaller and the colony more pedunculate than Diazona and the
relationship with the synoicids even more pronounced.
