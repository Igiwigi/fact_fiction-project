certain, however, during the last two years of our work we have taken the extra
precaution of filtering all “ outside” water through a Berkefeld filter. The only

difticulty we have encountered with the use of this water arises from the fact that
its purity and high alkalinity render it a medium in which bacteria and infusoria
multiply with great rapidity. The true alkalinity of the “ outside” water, that is the concentration of the
hydrogen ion, expressed in gramme-equivalents per litre, has been determined at
Plymouth by D. J. Marrnews by means of the colorimetric method of S6RENSEN. According to S6rENsen’s (82) determination the dissociation constant of pure water
is 107" at 18° C., and a litre of pure water at this temperature would therefore
contain 10-7” gramme-equivalents of hydrogen ions, and the same number of hydroxyl
ions.
