23. That in their more prominent inflexions the dotted curves of fig. 48 are generally
of smaller range than the thin-line curves is sufficiently explained by the fact that
the typical variations for each phase are averages for three or four consecutive days,
whilst the thin-line curves represent variations for first days, second days, third days,
&e., after new moon—all single days of the moon’s age. Indeed, it is easy to
show that the typical variations /,,(h), fi(h) should have been multiplied by

4a

o- = 1-031 when derived from the observed variations at the quarters, and by
339m
Sa = 1-022 when derived from the observed variations at the eighths phases ;

and similarly that f,9(h), f.a(h) should have been multiplied by — = 1'182 and

by 2 ees = 1-092 in the same two cases respectively.
