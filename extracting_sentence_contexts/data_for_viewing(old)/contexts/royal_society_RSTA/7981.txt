@ it is known to be when added directly to the petrol. For investigation of volatile
"Z liquids it was, therefore, decided to modify the apparatus with a view to increasing

© the degree of saturation of the air and other gas passing over. The two iron pots
© were replaced by U-tubes, one of which was filled with glass wool soaked with the
eb liquid. The tubes were placed side by side in a bath of water heated electrically
‘& to any desired temperature. Provision was also made whereby the gas and vapour
5 could be passed through a second heated tube before entering the engine.

Lead tetraethyl was tried by this method, but although it suppressed detonation
® it was only one-eighth as effective as when added to the petrol. This is, no doubt,
$ mainly due to the fact that the gas passing through the tube was not nearly saturated
© with the vapour, but a secondary cause may be that, when mixed with the petrol,
= the anti-knock is more intimately associated with the fuel during vaporization and
% the first stages of combustion, and is thus rendered more effective.
= ~=When the gas and lead tetraethyl vapour were passed through the heated tube
© before entering the engine, the anti-knock value was found to fall off slightly as the
& temperature was raised to 375° C, the value at any temperature being the same
& whether the vapour was in the presence of nitrogen, air, or 50°, nitrogen and
$S oxygen. The apparent diminishing effect, with little doubt, was due to the
g increasing pro-knock effect of the hot gas. Above this temperature the “ anti-
& knock” effect continued to fall in much the same way as before when nitrogen
was used, but in the presence of oxygen, yellow PbO formed on the walls of the
heater tube, and the “ anti-knock”’ effect fell off rapidly.
