values of the numbers in Mr. LusBock's Table XIX.

But if the correction, instead of being applied to the mean value of the interval (of
tide and transit), had been applied to the interyal calculated for declination 0, it is
clear the correction would have been

{132 + 848in2(p — 4)} 8in*3.

Mr. LunBock has given other tables also, from which the mean correction for
lunar declination may be collected. His Table XV., which contains the differences
of the interyals of the time of moon's transit and high water from the mean interval,
arranged according to the calendar months and to times of the moon's transit, is in
fact principally a table of the correction for lunar declination. For by examination
of that table, it will be seen that the correction in each month goes through its cycle
of 0, +, 0, —, in one semirevolution of the moon ; that is, while the declination passes
from its maximum north, to its maximum south, yalue : and since these results are the
mean of nineteen years, the moon will have been nearly as much on the north as on
the south of the ecliptic, and the result will be nearly the same as if she had moyed
in the ecliptic. It may be observed, however, that it appears by what has been shown
above, that the corrections increase faster than the declinations ; and therefore the
corrections due to the high declinations will not be quite balanced by those due to
the declinations which correspond to an equal opposite celestial latitude.

It is to be noticed, also, that this Table XV., being arranged for calendar months,
contains the effect of solar declination and parallax as well as of lunar declination.
