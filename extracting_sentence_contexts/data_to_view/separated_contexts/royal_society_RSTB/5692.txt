The double wedge of leakage water-table shown in this figure is 1 m. high
and 2 km, wide, equal to a rectangle 4 m. high and the same width, during the period of
maximum leakage, as against our considered estimate of nearly } m. (10 cm. water is
taken as 40 cm. water-table) over the same width in the permeable soils for an average
over the whole year, so it is not unreasonable. We are now in a position to divide the well readings on our farm into their com-
ponents. We do not pretend that this division is more than an estimation by graphic
methods, as in the two previous figures, but it seems to be a fairly close approximation
when tested against the facts observed, and, besides being informative, it is some-
what surprising. It is presented in fig. 41, based on the eight-year mean curve of
fig. 24, p. 356, which is repeated through two seasons for clearness. The rapid drop in
