Hence, the optimal configuration corresponds to a dia-
mond pattern, in which the second row is predicted to save
50% of energy compared with the leading fish. Laboratory observations of the three-dimensional structure
of schools of saithe, herring and cod [72], however, did not con-
firm the diamond pattern hypothesized by Weihs [71],
although some observations of small schools did show a simi-
lar pattern [73]. Despite the fact that fish generally do not seem
to school in a diamond pattern, the possibility that the vortex
street shed by single fish in a school may be exploited by
neighbours has been supported by other studies based on the
tail-beat frequency (TBF). The speed of BCF swimming fish is
strongly related to their TBF [69,74]. Work comparing the
TBF of trailing and leading fish shows that, for any given
speed, trailing fish show 7-14% lower TBF than leading fish
[75-78].
