This is an example of non-IRC dynamics,
showing that when the TS is excited, the path leading to other products is opened. However, the final product distribution does not depend on how the energy is injected
(i.e. we have the same results when the TS is excited with the same amount of energy on
vibrational degrees of freedom or on external rotation, see details in [18]).

(2) When starting from TSc we obtain again the two pathways mentioned in point (1). In
this case, the fact that trajectories initiated with less energy than ZPVE also follow both
pathways strongly suggests the presence of a bifurcation. Furthermore, for this TS, the
way of exciting the system (vibrational versus rotational) has a drastic effect on the final
product distribution.

(3) When starting from TSp a complex dynamics is also observed. Both products
(i) [Ca(HO)]?+ + HNC and (ii) [CaOH]*+ + [HCNH]* are obtained.
