As a rule there is no true S deflection, but
this may be seen in greater or lesser degree, especially before the pericardium is
opened, If Sis prominent then 7'is upright, a relation not without importance, but
one which must be left for later and separate research.* These variations are
described because the diagrams of surface distribution shown in fig. 1 are, without
exception, from hearts showing no S deflection and an invert 7, and it may be open to
question whether or not this type represents the most habitual and natural heart-beat
in the tortoise. The instability of the tortoise heart clearly emphasises the importance

* There is a similar relation between S and 7’ in the toad’s heart, 7’ being upright whenever S is

prominent and 7' being inverted when S is absent. Evidently these facts may help us to recognise the
meaning of 7 and its inversion. ON SPREAD OF THE EXCITATORY PROCESS IN THE VERTEBRATE HEART. 241

of obtaining, as an accompaniment of a series of direct surface readings, standard
curves of constant outline, for it is evident to me that any change in the form of the
standard curve is accompanied by a change in surface distribution. Observations
which bear out this statement deserve illustration, for the fact is of consequence.
