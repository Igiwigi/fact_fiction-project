The former exhibit none of the beautiful radiating lacunz which are
8 characteristic of the latter objects. It is true, we have frequently a small tubular
canal connecting two such cavities together, but these are very different from the
beautiful stellate objects seen in the bones of an eel or the scales of a Lepidosteus. The fact is, that though analogous they are not homologous. They differ in their
s$tructure, and till more in their origin; and the neglect of these differences has con-
tributed, in no small degree, to produce the amount of obscurity and confusion that
has hitherto invested the history both of the corpuscles of PurKINIE and the genesis
of bone, an obscurity which Dr. SHareEy was the first to clear away.
