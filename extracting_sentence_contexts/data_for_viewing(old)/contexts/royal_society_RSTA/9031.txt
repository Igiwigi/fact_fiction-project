As rubidium stands precisely half-way between potassium and ceesium as regards
atomic weight and atomic number, so does the crystallographic (monoclinic) axial
angle 8 stand half-way in the case of the rubidium salt.

The axial angle of ammonium ferrous selenate is very nearly identical with (7â€™ larger
than) that of the caesium salt.

The morphological axial ratios of the rubidium salt are intermediate between those
for the potassium and cesium salts. Those of the ammonium salt are close to those
of the rubidium salt, and thus partake of an intermediate character in the group.
This fact is in complete harmony with the supposition of true isomorphism of the
ammonium salt with the three alkali metallic salts of the group.

The following table institutes a complete comparison of the crystal angles of the
four salts. A careful analysis of these results has been made, by tabulating all
the differences between analogous angles of the four salts, and the results of the
analysis are concentrated in the short table which follows that of the angles.
