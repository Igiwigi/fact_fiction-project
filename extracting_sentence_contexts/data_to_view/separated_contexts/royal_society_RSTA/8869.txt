The calculated wave-number for this is
1967750 which makes the separation 166°72 and more in step with the others. The
uncertainty in the limit 24104'67 must therefore be very small. The doublet separations show a tendency to converge with increasing order, but this
is clearly due to the fact that the constant separation must be taken between the
strong first line and the weak second. After m= 3 the weak is not seen and the
observed separation is not the true one but that between the first and the second
strong one. The separation in the second series is somewhat larger than in the first,
that for the first being 167°17 and for the second 168'25+04 (mean for m= 2, 3).
