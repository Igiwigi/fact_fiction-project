recent sponges by artificial means.

Spicules thus loosely imbedded have been met with in the lower greensand strata |
of Haslemere, Sevenoaks, and Tilburstow Hill, and from beds of upper greensand age
in the vicinity of Warminster, Haldon, Blackdown, and Merstham. Figures are given
in the accompanying plates of all the forms discovered ; 8ome of these are of general
distribution, whilst others are restricted to the deposits of a single locality. With
the exception of the spicules from Haldon and Blackdown, first partly deseribed by
Mr. Parvrrr,* and snbsequently and more completely by Mr. CarTer,t this is the
first time that those from the lower greensand and from the other localities above
mentioned in the upper greensand strata have been figured in detail.

Mention has already been made of the fact that the spicules of the sponge-beds
referred to in this paper (the Faringdon sponge-gravel not being included) are
exclusively those of sponges with siliceous skeletons. Representatives of each of the
four orders of siliceous sponges occur, but in varying proportions. Monactinellid
spicules of acerate, acuate, and cylindrical forms are very abundant, but, judging
from their relative dimensions, the majority of these spicules belong to the tetracti-
nellide, where they are agsociated with trifid spicules, rather than to those monacti-
nellids whose skeletons are exclusively composed of uniaxial spicules. It is quite
possIible, however, that monactinellid sponges may have been also numerous in these
sponge-beds, though we have but few spicules which can be definitely recognised as
belonging to this order, for the spicules of most of the recent monactinellids are 80
minute and delicate that they would most likely be destroyed in fossilisation.
Tetractinellid sponges are strongly represented, and the majority of the spicules in the
