out with pigment. This pigment formation may also be noted in some of the
supporting processes of the smaller lateral follicles. In those levels where the
septum has ceased there is left a central column of secreting tissue, in which less
vacuolation takes place than in the other portions of the gland. It can be seen by
studying the series how the central pit, seen by the naked eye, is formed.

Passing now towards the base, the septum becomes thicker or wider in section and
loses its triangular shape, in fact, becoming wider towards the surface. It contains
more alveolar connective tissue, and finally it unites with, and takes part in, forming
a process from the anterior margin of the fin which is inserted into the centre of the
groove at the base of the spine. The epithelial structure here appears. as two lateral

fin joins the spine. It extends in a narrow layer on either side of this process of the
fin, which gives off a number of dentinal projections, which serve to support the
glandular tissue.
