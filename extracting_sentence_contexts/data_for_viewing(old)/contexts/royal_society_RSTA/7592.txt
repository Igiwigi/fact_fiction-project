Haft (1933) has determined the form of the excitation function associated with the
3°S—3?P transition, and Christoph (1935) has measured the absolute cross-section} at
three points. Both used optical methods. Their results, together with the corresponding
curve computed by Fundaminsky, are illustrated in figure 3a.{ The transitions 3°S'—> 3°D

+ In the reduction of his measurements Christoph did not allow for the temperature of the sodium vapour;
but by using information he gives it was possible to apply the necessary correction.

t Entirely different results have been reported by Michels (1931), who claimed that type XY peaks occur

for this and for other transitions. His work is ignored, since his technique is rendered extremely suspect by
the fact that it gave vanishingly small cross-sections at energies slightly above the critical potentials.

and 3%S-> 4*S have not been studied experimentally, but Haft has investigated the emission
from the 42D and 52S levels. In view of the general similitude law already mentioned, the
excitation functions obtained are adopted in figures 3,¢ as suitable for comparison with
those calculated; they are, of course, in arbitrary units, and are displaced by the energy
differences between the 32D and 42D levels, and between the 42S and 52S levels, respec-
tively. No laboratory data on the 3°S->42P transition is available; in any event the
theoretical cross-sections are so sensitive to details of the wave functions involved that
great reliance cannot be placed upon them.
