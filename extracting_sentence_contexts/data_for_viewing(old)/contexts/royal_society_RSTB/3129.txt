equally well for Juliania. With this the affinities to the Anacardiaceze are
exhausted, and they are not sufficiently strong, in my opinion, to justify the juxta-
position of the two orders. The next comparison is with the Cupulifers, taking the
order as limited by Bentrnam and Hooker. There is nothing in the secretions nor
in the foliage to warrant an approximation of the two orders, and in habit of growth
the Julianiaceswe are very different. But divergences as great, or greater, exist
between closely associated orders, and even between genera referred to the same
order; and when we come to the inflorescence and flowers, aflinities are evident ;
that is if affinities are deducible from similarities in structure.

The male inflorescence, the male flowers and the pollen of Juliana adstringens are
so near in texture, structure and form to the same parts in certain species of oak
that, detached, they might be referred to the genus Quercus. In fact, there is much
greater dissimilarity in the male inflorescences and flowers of different species of
Quercus than there is between those of Juliania and those species of Quercus which
have a flaccid male inflorescence and stamens alternating with the segments of the
perianth,

The female inflorescence and the female flowers of Juliania are not represented by
exact counterparts in the Cupuliferee, but the analogies are perhaps greater than
with any other order, Several female flowers, in a closed involucre, is a characteristic
of Juliania, of Fagus, Castanea and Castanopsis. In all three of the genera of the
Cupuliferee named the involucre dehisces regularly or irregularly, and the nuts fall
