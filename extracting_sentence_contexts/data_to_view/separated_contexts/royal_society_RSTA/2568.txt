Such a net may have holes, even rather big ones, and at some point you might wish to patch or
repair it. But its sole function is to catch fish: “You need a net to catch fish, at the moment the fish is

you forget the words.’

However, at the deeper personal level the decisive element of Mathematics, oftentimes more
imperative than its factual, technical, pragmatical or mystical dimensions, is its aesthetic value. The
way we experience mathematical proofs is essentially not much different from the way we behold
quattrocento frescoes: Piero della Francesca, Filippo Lippi, Benozzo Gozzoli, Pinturicchio, or any of
their contemporaries. Or, for shorter proofs, the way we savour la pittura fiamminga, someone like
Robert Campin, Jan van Eyck, Rogier van der Weyden, or Hans Memling.
