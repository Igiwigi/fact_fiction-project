My DEar SIR,

[| SHOULD Sooner have communicated the account, which you
are 50 good as to request, of my further experiments on the
decomposition of ammonia, if I had not been anxious to obtain,
by frequent and careful repetition of them, results not affected
by any of those numerous causes of error, which easily insi-
nuate themselves into processes of so much delicacy. You
have already been informed that the fact, which T lately men-
tioned to you, (tending to prove the existence of oxygen as
an element of the volatile alkali, by the discovery of oxygen
gas in the products of its analysis ) is not entitled to confidence,
owing to the admission of a small quantity of atmospherical
air, in a way which was not at all suspected. Frequent repe-
titions of the same process, under circumstances wholly un-
objectionable, have fully satisfied me, that no portion what-
soever of oxygen gas is evolved by electricity from ammonia,
even when, by means of an apparatus constructed for the
