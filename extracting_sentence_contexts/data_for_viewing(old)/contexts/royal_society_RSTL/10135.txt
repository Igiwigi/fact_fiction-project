and becoming quite solid. Here, it would seem, that in 80 small a larva of 80 large
a Fish—and that Fish lying at the base of the greab archaic group of the Ganoids—we
have a good chance of seeing the primordial vertebrate skull in its utmost simplicity.
The fact is, that we have a confusingly simple state of things.

In the fore part of the spine, as well as in the whole basi-cranial region, the
paired skeletal tracts that lie right and left of the mesoblastic sheath of the notochord,
the hardening cartilage shows no signs of segmentation or intercalary vertebral 8ub-
division ; this is just like what occurs in the Selachians (Trans. Zool. Soc., vol. x.,
plate 35). Moreover, this Chondrosteous Ganoid remains in this condition, as far as I
can find, throughout life, and does not acquire the occipito-cervical articulation, 80 well
known in the Selachians, but which in them is a secondary modification of the parts.
By careful comparison of all the facts I have been able to gather by observation of
many types and at many stages, I cannot help coming to the conclusion that the
normal intereatary vertebral segmentation with which we are s0 familiar in the post-
cephalic region of the Vertebrata, generally, is « comparatively late and 8econdary
8pecialization in the evolution of this, the highest, group of animals.

If Mr. BaLrour's suggestion (* Comp. Embryol.,” vol. ii., p. 366) be true, viz. : that
the fore-brain with its special optic and olfactory outgrowths is a gort of outgrowth or
