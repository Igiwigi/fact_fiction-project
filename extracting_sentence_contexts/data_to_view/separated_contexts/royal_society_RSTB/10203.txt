Moreover, treatment with low

cross-sectional study in 26 older humans showed that a high pocampal hyperactivation and improved performance in a

amyloid burden in the medial prefrontal cortex, as measured hippocampus-dependant memory task [15,62]. Finally, a recent study employing a chemogenetic approach that, in fact, excess neuronal activity, hypersynchrony and El

consequence of Af accumulation but a cellular mechanism cal symptoms.
