in 9 offspring, every condition between purely cruciate and fully normal petals, the
plants being otherwise uniform. Both the relative dominance of the cruciate con-
dition and its variability were greater than in the diploid crosses.

It thus appears that many cr genes are present in the Oenothera germplasm, and
if, for instance, the velans and gaudens complexes of O. Lamarckiana each contain such
a factor, then the cruciate mutation may arise through crossing-over between the
two complexes, in such fashion that the assemblage of cr genes overbalances the
genes making for broad petals. Similarly, the phenotypic expression of the cruciate
mutation may only be reached in other species when Cr genes already present
are rearranged so that in the zygote they dominate the Cr genes. To determine
whether this is an adequate interpretation of the various cruciate mutations and
their inheritance requires still further investigations. The fact that there is generally
no other difference between the cruciate and broad-petalled races of a particular
species makes it difficult to believe that crossing-over of the ordinary type can be
involved.

The occurrence of broad, narrow, and intermediate petals on the same plant, as
well as in different plants of the F, in crosses between wide and narrow petals, is
similar to the hereditary behaviour as regards longer and shorter petals in certain
Oenothera crosses (GATES 1917, 1923). Hybrids of O. biennis x rubricalyx and its
reciprocal were made, O. biennis having petals ca. 20 mm. and O. rubricalyx ca. 40 mm.
in length. The F, were uniform, but they were few in number and larger numbers
might have shown variation in flower-size. In F,â€”F,, however, three forms of
segregation took place ; (1) genetic segregation of plants having longer or shorter
