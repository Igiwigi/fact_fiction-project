We have now to consider the nature of the heat evolutions along the lines CH and
IL of fig. 4.

The fact which has already been stated that in slowly cooled alloys eutectic is
found to the right of the point F, while this eutectic disappears when full equilibrium
has been obtained, points to the conclusion that there is in these alloys a gradual
reaction at some temperature above that of the eutectic line, and that this reaction,
when allowed to complete itself, results in the total absorption of the liquid phase
which would otherwise have solidified along the dotted line FP. The existence of a
series of heat evolutions along the horizontal line CH at once suggests that such a
reaction is represented by these heat evolutions, and this view is confirmed when it is
remembered that in curves of more rapid cooling these heat evolutions are much less
marked, an observation which indicates the occurrence of a gradual reaction. We
have, further, the discontinuity in the liquidus curve at the point C, which also
suggests that we are here dealing with a compound which is produced by a reaction
of the solid which had begun to crystallize along the branch of the liquidus CD, with
