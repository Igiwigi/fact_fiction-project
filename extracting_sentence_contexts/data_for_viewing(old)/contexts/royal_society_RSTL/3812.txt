Now these are precisely the changes in the form of the rings expressed by snc-
cessive modifications of Mr. Airy's formula, corresponding to the increments in the
retardation which belong to the periodical colours of the films,

In the instance of the metallic films it is a question whether in any case the exist-
ence of elliptic polarization be due to the action of the film simply, or whether the
snbjacent metallic surface have any share in producing it, while the film acts as a
retarding plate, which would render the conception of the mode of action more com-
plex.

These are points on which, perhaps, at present we cannot form a decisive opinion.
But. the fact that the ellipticity, to whatever cause it may be due, undergoes the
changes just mentioned, affords an interesting comparison with theory, and may aid
future advances towards a knowledge of the nature of the action which produces
elliptic polarization in these cases.

Apparatus and Method of experimenting.

The arrangement of my apparatus was, essentially, as follows : the light was polar-
ized by transmission through a Nicol-prism ; this was attached to a small graduated
arc, 80 that it could be adjusted to throw the polarized ray at any required incidence
on the sarface under examination ; and could he turned about its own axis, 80 that
the plane of polarization might be inclined to that of incidence.
