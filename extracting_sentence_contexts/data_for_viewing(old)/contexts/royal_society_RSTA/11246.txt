the transport numbers determined in dilute solutions are approximately correct. for
extreme dilution, and that they may be legitimately so far modified as to lead to
constant specific velocities, %» and vs, in all combinations of the corresponding ions.
Kourauscn’s values are thus obtained.

In general, electrolytes composed of monad ions, such as the chlorides of the alkali
metals, are those which yield the best and most consistent results, while compounds
containing divalent and polyvalent ions, such as Zn or SO,, do not behave so conform-
ably with the law represented by the equation. This is shown both by the great

qilteration in the value of the transport numbers produced by change of concentration
sin many such cases, and by the fact that polyvalent ions do not appear to afford
constant values of ws and vs in their different combinations, on which account they
"Bare excluded from Kounrauscu’s tables of specific ionic velocities. Whatever may
=be the full explanation of these apparent contradictions of theory, it is probable that
Bin these cases the ionization is not of such a character that the nature and number of
‘Zions of either kind ean be deduced direct from the known composition of the solution ;
= in other words, the number of active ions of either kind is not related in the usual
§simple manner to 7.
@ The third chapter in the history of the study of ionic velocities is that which deals
‘awith their direct observation and measurement, and was begun by Lopar in 1885
8(‘ Brit. Ass. Reports,’ 1886, p. 389). The great value of his work lay in the ingenious
‘onception of the possibility of actually watching the advance of ions whose colour
