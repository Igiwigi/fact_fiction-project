An
early dispersal of the lamp-black on the abaxial side of primordia was general. Again,
whereas from an early stage there was evidence of active dispersal of the deposit in the
subapical region immediately adjacent to the base of the apical cone, the apex, except in
the region of P, and P;, still showed a dense deposit. That some growth was taking place, in
the apical cone was, however, indicated by the fact that the black deposit slowly became
broken up into a mosaic-like pattern; with the passage of time a gradual dispersal of the
lamp-black on the apex, from the base upwards, took place. It could then be seen that the
deposit lay farthest down the sides of the cone in the positions of J, and J,. Residual black
areas were also present in interfoliar positions just outside the base of the apical cone.
