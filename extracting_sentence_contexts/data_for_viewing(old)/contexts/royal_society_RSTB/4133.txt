They are much rarer than those species which are also common to Peninsular India,
and these again than those of wider distribution. The endemies increase in number
to VR, the species of wide dispersal towards VC. There has been ample time to
become VC if really adapted to local conditions, yet only 19 out of 809 have done
so. The endemic species in families that have many are rarer than in families that
have few. Natural selection requires that many forms shall modify in the same
direction, and this cannot have been the case with many of these forms, which only
oceur as a very few individuals in a very restricted area.

The endemic genera (23 in number) have 52 species with a mean rarity of 45, or
greater than that of the endemic species as a whole (Tables XVII-XIX). The
genera of one species among them are the commonest, while Doona with 11 species
shows a rarity of 4Â°6, and Stemonoporus, with 15, one of 5:4. These facts cannot
be explained on any theory of adaptation.

Table XX shows these facts summarised, and goes in the exact reverse direction
all through to what it should follow if the theory of natural selection could be
relied upon.

The second conclusion drawn is that on the average the commonness of a species
depends upon its age from the time of its arrival in, or evolution in, the country.
The commonness of any individual species will, of course, also depend upon its
degree of adaptation to local conditions, and upon many things which can only be
regarded as chance, such as the sudden appearance of new factors, like diseases, ete.,
in the problem.
