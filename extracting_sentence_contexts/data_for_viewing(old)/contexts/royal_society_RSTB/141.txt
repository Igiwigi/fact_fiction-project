consequently, in nearly every case, the ovum segments when it is not charged with
yolk. :

Even the ovum of Mammals, which we have good reason to believe formerly
contained much yolk, segments. ‘The tendency of the ovum to repeat ancestral types
being no longer checked by the yolk nor by any other cause.

In Miilepora we have an example of an ovum which is not only matured and
fertilised in a confined space—the ccenosarcal canals—lined by solid carbonate of lime,
but also has to migrate to the gastrozooids after the carly stages of development have
commenced.

These facts are, I think, quite sufficient to account for the absence of segmentation.

But what evidence have we that the ovum of Millepora never did contain a large
amount of food yolk ?

In the first place, had the ovum of Millepora ever been much larger than it is at
present, it must have possessed either ampull or larger canals. Not a trace of these
is to be found in M. plicata, the only species of which the sexual cells have been
examined,*

Had these ever been developed it is most probable they would have been retained,
and the ovum, having more space for its development in the early stages, would have
segmented, as the ovum does in Mammalia.
