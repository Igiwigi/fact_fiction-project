BREEDING INTO THE POLYMORPHISM OF PAPILIO POLYTES. 229

the usual attachment to a leaf or other support, but then, instead of casting their
i skins, gradually shrivelled up and died ; it appeared, in fact, as if they had begun to
: change their skins before they had fed sufficiently, and that they starved during the
process. The second form of death appeared after some fifty broods had been reared,
and became gradually more severe until the experiments were abandoned. It was
caused either by a bacterial or a protozoal disease and was almost certainly hereditary,
as the most stringent measures failed to stamp it out. Theoretically, perhaps, a
high larval mortality, exercising no selective function, ought not to affect the
statistical results, but in practice this would only apply if the number of broods was
sufficiently great; in the experiments to be detailed there is little doubt that the
relative numbers in many broods have been seriously affected, and that they must all
be looked on with suspicion.

Turning next to the imago in captivity, a few notes must be given on the cages
