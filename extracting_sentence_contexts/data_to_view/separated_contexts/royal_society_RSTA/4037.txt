Surface pressure, /7, of monolayers from charged hydrophobized silica particles at the air/water interface measured
by a Langmuir trough. (a) Plots of /7 versus the area, A, for four consecutive compression/expansion cycles with the same
monolayer on the surface of pure water. (b) The same data are plotted as /7 versus A~*/?; from the slopes of the linear portions
the values of the mean particle aggregation number, n, can be determined, as shown in the figure. (c) Comparison of J7 versus
A isotherms for particle monolayers at the surface of pure water and an aqueous solution of 1 mM KCI. (d) Comparison of [7
versus A~3/? plots for particle monolayers on the surface of a 0.1 mM KCI solution (compression and expansion) and a1 mM KCI
solution (compression). (After [24].)

of charged particles at both air/water and oil / water interfaces. The linear portions of the curves
obey the equation
IT =CA~*? + 1p, (2.1)

where the coefficient C characterizes the slope of the experimental line and [7p is a background
surface pressure. The slanted parts of the /7(A) isotherms (figure 2a-c), corresponding to higher
A (and lower /7) values, can be explained by the fact that the electrostatic interaction has a certain
range, so that above a given distance between the particles they are not strongly interacting and,
thus, only a ‘gas’ phase of particles is present. Our study is focused on the steep parts of the
surface-pressure isotherms, corresponding to the compression of particle monolayers without
voids. Note that equation (2.1) is obeyed by monolayers from monodisperse particles, as well as
by monolayers from slightly polydisperse particles such as those used in this study [23].
