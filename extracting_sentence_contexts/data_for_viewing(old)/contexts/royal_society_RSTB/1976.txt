converse change takes place. The cylindrical process, even when it contains a
vascular strand, readily assumes the flat prothalloid form. But, as the examples
represented in figs. 64 and 65 show, even when in addition to the presence of a
vascular strand, one or more ramenta have been formed on the surface, this change
occurs. It would be possibly an undue use of terminology to call this change
apospory. The fact that there is only a difference of degree between these cases and
the production of prothalli on the first leaf of a sporophyte which has been developed

wamously may, however, be pointed out. This latter condition is known in a
wgriety of Nephrodium Filia-mas.*
g The positions in which sporangia were found on prothalli of Scolopendrium vulgare
fad Nephrodium dilatatum have been fully enumerated, An examination of them
ads to the conclusion that, apart from the fact that the portion of the prothallus on
Thich the sporangia were situated contained tracheides and sometimes bore ramenta,
i€ did not present evidence of being a reduced sporophyte. That the peculiarities

j the tissue beneath sporangia are to be regarded as indicating the assumption of
= bie characters, is indicated not only by the contrast between it and cells
@ the prothallus but also by the occasional association of sporangia with a vegetative
Bud. It need hardly be pointed out that this does not necessitate the assumption
fhat the group of sporangia represents the result of reduction of a bud.t Even the
‘Becurrence of sporangia on the middle lobe in Nephrodium dilatatum is not, in the
‘ght of their occurrence elsewhere, sufficiently explained by regarding this region
B a foliar structure. At least the early leaves of the young plants in this culture
‘Hever showed any indication of the production of sporangia.
