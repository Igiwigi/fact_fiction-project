well as a directrix line of I’,5, and it is in fact a triple line on F,5. It can be shown, then,
that Y consists of Segre cubics which all contain F,° and have 4 as double line, and
that the tangent cones to these cubics at any given point P of are each composed of a
fixed prime II through 2 together with another prime through a fixed plane op also
through 4—the prime II remaining invariable as P moves on 2, and the plane op
describing a quadric line cone K,’. The Quadric-Quartic Transformation {2, 4, 4}.
