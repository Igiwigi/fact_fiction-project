They state that during their determinations of the atomic
weight of palladium, “the extreme variation of the zero-point did not exceed 0°3
division in two weeks.” The sensibility (11°1) of their balance was, however,
somewhat low. Dean “found that the weighings could be made quite easily to a tenth of a
milligramme, provided that the final weighing was not made until half-an-hour after
the tube and weights had been placed upon the pans of the ‘balance. . . . . That
the half-hour interval needed was not on account of hygroscopic moisture absorbed
from the air by the material is shown by the fact that the weighings taken
immediately were always greater than those taken later.”

For the re-determination of the atomic weight of nitrogen, Gray** used a balance
by Sartorius. The instrument was placed in a cellar and screened by a tin box.
