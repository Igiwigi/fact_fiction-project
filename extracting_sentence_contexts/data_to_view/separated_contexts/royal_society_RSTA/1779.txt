Since the 1950s mean O3 concentrations have been growing at a rate of 1-5 ppb/decade in
the Northern Hemisphere (NH) and by 2 ppb/decade in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) [2]. As these concentrations have risen, evidence of O3 injury and damage to vegetation due
to the phyto-toxic nature of O3, has also increased substantially over the last half-century
[1]. The fact that O3 is a secondary pollutant leads to significant geospatial and temporal
variability in O3 concentrations caused by conditions such as downwind proximity to large-
scale emission sources, meteorological patterns (such as seasonality, land-coastal processes and
monsoon systems) and stratosphereâ€”-troposphere exchange. This means that O3 concentrations
tend to be highest in rural and semi-rural areas downwind of urban and industrial sources of
pre-cursor emissions, i.e. in those locations important for agriculture, forestry and grasslands,
along with the ecosystem services they provide [3]. O3 and its precursors are also transported
around the world in air masses; when O3 degradation (by chemical transformation and
deposition) is slower than O3 generation, background O3 concentrations will be enhanced.
