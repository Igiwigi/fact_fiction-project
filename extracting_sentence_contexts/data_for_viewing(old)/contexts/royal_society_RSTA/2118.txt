constituents (amounts denoted by nj). The ‘greatness’ of this second-law consequence stems from
the fact that existence and concavity must hold for any system, but the functional dependence
of the relation varies from system to system and is in fact what characterizes its equilibrium
properties.

By analogy, and to allow full flexibility of formulation, what we propose to call the ‘fourth law
of thermodynamics’ is any assertion that—regardless of the specific and technical details that are
peculiar to one or the other non-equilibrium theory, or of the prose preferences of the different
authors—entails a principle of existence of a metric field, defined over the entire state space of
the modelled system, with respect to which the irreversible (dissipative) component of the time
evolution of the system (or of each of its subsystems) is (locally) steepest entropy ascent (SEA).
The functional dependence of the SEA metric on the state variables varies from system to system
and is in fact what characterizes its non-equilibrium behaviour.

In §§2 and 3, we prepare the stage for the detailed formulation of the fourth law in §4 and one
of its consequences in §5.

2. Representation on the non-equilibrium energy—entropy diagram

The second law implies also the well-known ‘maximum entropy principle’, which states
[3, p. 119] that among all the states of the system that (within the given model) share the same
(mean) value of the energy, the same values of the external control parameters (if any) and the
same (mean) values of the other independent conserved properties (if any), only the (unique)
stable equilibrium state has the maximal entropy. Therefore, for example, respectively, for (a) an
