Of this group, A.
parasiticus Spearn, Catalogue Number Ac. 14, gives the largest figure for ‘“ carbon
unaccounted for,” 7.¢., 0-659, corresponding to about 19 per cent. of the glucose fer-
mented. This has been shown to consist almost entirely of a y-pyrone derivative,
somewhat inaccurately called “ kojic acid,” since it is 5-hydroxy-2-hydroxymethyl-
y-pyrone (see Part VII). The diagnostic value of the carbon balance sheets is evidenced
by the fact that, whilst A. parasiticus has the highest value for “ carbon unaccounted
for’ and gives the highest yield of kojic acid, this compound is, in fact, produced by
all except one species in this group, and in amounts roughly corresponding to the values
for “ carbon unaccounted for ” of these different species. If it is intended to submit to intensive investigation a number of other selected species
of Aspergillus, the following are obvious choices :—

Clavatus group.—A. clavatus (Washington 138), having 0-697 of “ carbon unaccounted
for” (18 per cent. of glucose fermented) and 0-835 of “ volatile neutral compounds ”
(21 per cent.). Glaucus group.—A. disjunctus, having 0-948 of “ carbon unaccounted for” (31 per
cent.) and 0-268 of “ non-volatile acids ” (9 per cent).
