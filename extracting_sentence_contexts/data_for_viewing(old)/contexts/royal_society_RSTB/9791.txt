tome transcripts corresponding to nematocyte, nematoblast
and nerve cell genes (electronic supplementary material, S6
and $7). These results indicate some contamination of the
two epithelial populations by non-epithelial cells during the
dissociation/sorting process (electronic supplementary
material, S6B). However, the expression level of these ‘con-
taminant’ genes is low when compared with their
