question necessary. Let me add that it suffices simply to wave a bunch of hay in the
air of the shed to make it as infective as the laboratory air. Even the unprotected

While continuing the conflict and experiencing the defeats recorded in the foregoing
pages, a remark of Professor LisvER's sometimes occurred to me. To apply the anti-
septic treatment with snccess, the surgeon must, he holds, be interpenetrated with the
convietion that the germ-theory of putrefaction is true. He mnust not permit occasional
