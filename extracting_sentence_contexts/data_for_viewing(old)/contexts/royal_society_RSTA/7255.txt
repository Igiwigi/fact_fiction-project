apparent activation energy of about 45 kcal. The chain mechanism suggested to account
for the reaction order will have an observed energy of activation equal to E+ }£,, where
E, and £, are the respective activation energies of the steps:

Al(CH,), -> CH, +Al(CH,),,
Al(CH,), + CH, > CH,+Al(CH,),CH,.

E, is ascribed the probable value of 15 kcal. or less, by analogy with similar processes.
E,, according to our thermochemical measurements, should be rather more than 90 kcal.
In consequence, if the suggested pyrolysis mechanism is correct, the apparent activation
energy should be about 60 kcal., which is not in good agreement with experiment.
However, the reaction mechanism is not completely clear, and that it may need modifica-
tion is also suggested by two other facts. First, the addition of hydrogen decreases the
rate of pyrolysis and also decreases the apparent activation energy, the opposite effects to
those expected. Secondly, in several of the experiments, the ratio of methane formed to
aluminium trimethyl consumed was found to be considerably greater than that theoretically
possible on the basis of a dimeric vapour. In consequence, a tetrameric vapour was sug-
gested, but further study by Yeddanapalli & Schubert, as reported in a private communica-
tion to Pitzer & Gutowsky (1946), has shown that the vapour is only dimeric at room
temperature. Since compounds such as Al(CH,)Br are known to exist, the additional
methane may perhaps be accounted for by the formation of Al(CH,) CH,, this subsequently
being measured as unchanged aluminium trimethyl. Possibly relevant to this point is the
fact that Yeddanapalli & Schubert themselves accidentally prepared a new organic com-
pound of aluminium boiling at 49 to 51° and more spontaneously inflammable than
aluminium trimethyl. The alternative suggestion that this might be an organic compound
