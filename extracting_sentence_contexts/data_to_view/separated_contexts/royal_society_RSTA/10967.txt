White light must therefore be cut off as far as practicable, and by use of an
absorbing medium such as blue glass coated with a gelatine film dyed with a blue dye
this is attained, The use of a second prism in front of the spectrum is inconvenient
though effectual.

(IIL) Possible Mixtures of Sensations. Having at one end of the spectrum a pure red sensation, and at the other mixed
sensations, due to the stimulation of the red and a blue sensation, it remains to isolate
the green sensation. Owing to the overlapping of the curves in the green of the
spectrum, due to the fact that this region stimulates all three of the sensations, the
effect of the pure green sensation is never experienced by a normal eye, though
presumably it is by what are termed the red-blind of the Young Theory. In any
colour where the stimulation of all three sensations occurs, there must be always
an admixture of white light, and we have to search for that point in the spectrum
where white alone is added to the green sensation. The following diagram, fig. 1, will show the variations in composition of a colour
that may be met with.
