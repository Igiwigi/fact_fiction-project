where primes denote differentiation with respect to 6. The corresponding area form is

do = —py/(p')? + (6)? do A dg.

To do vortex dynamics, we need then to view a surface M as both Riemannian and symplectic, the
corresponding symplectic surface being related to the phase space of the system. This is different
from what happens in Celestial Mechanics when given a surface M where the dynamics take
place, the space is associated with the corresponding fiber bundle TM*.

Remark. From the discussion above, it follows that when studying point vortex dynamics on
an ellipsoid the area form is different from that of the sphere and therefore the canonical variables
cannot be those of the sphere, as suggested by some authors. In fact for the ellipsoid of revolution
with p(@) =siné@ and (0) =bcos8, then

x=sin@cosg and y=sin@sing, z=bcos6,
and consequently the corresponding area form is

dopnipsoid = y 1 + (b? — 1) sin? 6 d(cos 8) A dg.

It follows that canonical variables for the ellipsoid of revolution (for b 4 1) are

q=9 and p=[ Vise —1)sin? 6 d(cos 6),

which are quite different from those of the sphere, as inferred by some authors.
