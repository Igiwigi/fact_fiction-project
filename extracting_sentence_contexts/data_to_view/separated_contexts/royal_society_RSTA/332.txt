Experiments show that under laboratory conditions
§ the crushing strength of basalt is 1:5 10° dynes/cm.? Jeffreys also considers that the
© occurrence of earthquakes with foci as deep as 600 to 700 km. indicates that considerable
5 strength must exist at such depths. On the other hand, it seems difficult to reconcile these
+s results with the observed fact that areas where sediment has accumulated, such as the edge of
6 the continental shelf, appear to be in isostatic equilibrium. The uplift in Fennoscandia as a
£ result of the recession of the ice cap also indicates that in such areas readjustment can take
place comparatively quickly. It is also doubtful whether the required strength could be
5 maintained at the high temperatures found at great depths.
