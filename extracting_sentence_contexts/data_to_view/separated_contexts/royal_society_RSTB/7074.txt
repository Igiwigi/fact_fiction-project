Leaf formation. Three to seven new leaf primordia may be formed. They appear in normal
or approximately normal positions, i.e. in continuity with the existing spiral sequence; in
fact, they continue to be formed until all the available space on the meristem has been
utilized. The last-formed primordium may thus be situated close to the damaged apical
region (see also ยง8). Bud formation.
