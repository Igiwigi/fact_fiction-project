There is a critical need for action. More than half of all biodiversity hotspots have lost 90% of
their vegetation [134], and the remnant patches are impacted
by climate change. In fact, the least disturbed hotspot, the
California Floristic Province, recently experienced its most
severe drought in 1500 years [135]. Habitat fragmentation is
also increasing; 70% of global forests lie within 1 km of a
road [136]. These changes have lowered species abundances
[137] and have increased extinction rates [138].
