The piezometer was then
taken out of the cannon, and the flexible ring found to be
eight inches up the rod, evidently proving the rod to have
been forced into the cylinder that distance, showing also a
compression of about one per cent. We have seen by re-
peated experiments, that to be able to produce this degree of
compression, three per cent must be pumped into the gun. This fact proves, either that the gun expands, or that the
water enters the pores of the cast iron ; it is probable both
these circumstances contribute to produce this effect. This experiment was made in America in the year 181g,
and before I had time to strengthen my apparatus for the
purpose of making farther experiments, I was obliged to
embark for this country. On my passage, however, I had
frequent opportunities of repeating those I had already made,
and of making others by a natural pressure.
