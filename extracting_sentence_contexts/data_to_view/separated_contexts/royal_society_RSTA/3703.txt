Figure 5 shows the results obtained at T= 250K for Kt-(Bz)4
and Cst-(Bz)4. As can be seen in figure 5, the fluctuation of the Bz-M* distances is larger for Kt than for
Cs*, indicating that K*-(Bz)4 forms a more flexible structure than Cst-(Bz)4, thus favouring an
earlier dissociation of K*-(Bz)4 than of Cs+-(Bz)4. In fact, in our previous paper on M*-(Bz)y
systems [29], where the distances between the centre of the benzene rings and the alkali ion were
analysed as a function of the cluster size, it was observed that such distances are equal for the
GM of Cs*-(Bz)4; however, for Kt+-(Bz)4 only three of them are equivalent, while the fourth one is
slightly larger. Moreover, strong ‘magic numbers’ of the M*+-(Bz),, clusters appear at n = 2,3 and 4
for M = Na,K, and Cs, respectively, thus explaining the higher stability of Cs -(Bz)4. The increase
of two molecules of Bz in respect to the magic number n = 2 for Nat explains the dissociation of
the Nat-(Bz)4 at low temperatures.
