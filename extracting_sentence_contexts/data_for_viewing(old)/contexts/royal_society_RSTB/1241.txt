In L. clavatum and alpinum (and, perhaps, also in Lepidodendron) the tra

ed state of the sporangium, which, however, has not been found in any of
ts hitherto considered. The advantages of a partitioned condition, where
rangium is large, are plain enough ; not only would the nutritive surface

sporangium by animal, or other agency, would probably destroy the
