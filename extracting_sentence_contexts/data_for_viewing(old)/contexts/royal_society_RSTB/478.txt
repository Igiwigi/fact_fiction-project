My material consisted of specimens collected by myself and preserved in different
ways some time ago. Though these were excellent for cutting sections, yet I needed
the live animal for examination of the tubes, circulation, &c. I therefore tried to get
some specimens alive, and, in July, 1891, I received some living Scutigera from M. pg
Lacaze-Duruters, who collected them for me in the South of France, and packed
them so carefully and skilfully that they reached me quite unhurt. I am glad to
have this opportunity of thanking him for the kindness which prompted him to take
a great deal of trouble (for the animals are never common, and are very rare at this
time of the year) to. oblige a fellow naturalist.

I shall first describe the organ itself, and then give the reasons which seem to me
conclusive evidence that it is a respiratory organ, and then state the bearings which
it seems to me to have upon other morphological facts.

The series of organs which, I hope to show, perform the function of respiration in
Scutigera, are arranged in the middle line at the posterior end of each dorsal scale.
They are best seen in a specimen which has been preserved in corrosive sublimate
acidulated with hydrochloric acid. Such a mode of preservation bleaches the pigment
and renders the heart and the organs very apparent.

Description of Organs.

Each organ is placed in the middle line at the posterior end of a dorsal scale.
Each dorsal scale (oft which there are eight) is provided with an organ, except the
last. The organ consists externally of a slit bounded by two pairs of curved ridges
