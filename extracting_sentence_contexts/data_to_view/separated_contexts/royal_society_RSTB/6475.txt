32 is of a section through the hind-gut, and
shows such a mass (fm.) almost filling the lumen. Between it and the epithelium there can be seen a
layer (/ay.) of material which represents a mixture
of finely divided food and secretion according to the
above argument. It can, in fact, be seen to con-
tain fine carmine particles (the main mass also
consists of carmine), while that portion of the
layer nearest to the epithelium contains blue-stain-
ing material agreeing in appearance with the vesi-
cular inclusions of some of the cells (see p. 284). There is reason for believing that this layer is left
behind while the solid mass passes backwards, for
sections in front of and behind such a mass show
similar layers of material; in any case, it is con-
stantly added to as fresh material is transmitted
