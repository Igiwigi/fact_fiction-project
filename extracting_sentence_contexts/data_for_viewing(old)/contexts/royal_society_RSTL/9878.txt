Tf the viscosity be small, the ellipticity given to the orbit-will diminish, because A
ey not comprised between the two chain-dob curves. Thus for this class of tide the
= Beircularity i is stable, whilst the configuration is unstable.

& A displacement on the left-hand side of the ridge of maxima will cause the satellite
= to fall into the planet, because the point will slide down into the ravine. But the
= cireularity of the orbib is again stable.

This figure at once shows that if planet and satellite be revolving with maximum
{5 ergy as parts of a rigid body, and if, without altering the total moment of
2 momentum, or the equality of the two periods, we impart infinitesimal ellipticity to
Stho orbit, the satellite will fall into the planet. This follows from the fact that the
line n=N runs on to the lope of the ravine.

& If on the other hand without affecting the moment of momentum, or the circularity,
= we infinitesimally disturb the relation n=, then the satellite will either recede or
& approach the planet according to the nature of the disturbance.

bo These two statements are independent of the nature of the frictional interaction of
S the two bodies.
