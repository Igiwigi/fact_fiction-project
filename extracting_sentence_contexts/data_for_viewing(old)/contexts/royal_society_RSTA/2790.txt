Hence, the configuration space of spherical dumbbell is SO(3, R). In fact, we can consider it as a
rigid body with tensor of inertia

ms? —msc 0
I=] —msc mo + myc? 0 , C=ay,s=V1-c2.
0 0 mo + my

Eigenvalues of I give the following principal moments of inertia:

=m tm+A), b= (mo+m—-A), b=motm, A= (mo = 11)? + 4c? mom.

Finally, the spherical dumbbell equations of motion can be written in the following form:
