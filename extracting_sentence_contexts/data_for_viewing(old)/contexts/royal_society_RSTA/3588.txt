with hydrogen, there is no need for them to agglomerate. In vacancy
agglomeration, you would lose these very nice hydrogen sites next to
the centre of the vacancies. It has to start somewhere, maybe at oxide-
or carbide—metal interfaces, where the crack is initiated. Or the other
processes are taking place.
Adrian Sutton agree. I agree that dislocation activity is probably the key to it.

Tony Paxton You briefly mention the work of another mechanism called HESIV from
Nagumo [24]: hydrogen-enhanced stress-induced vacancy formation.
The experiments are quite striking. These are the experiments they
did in iron-silicon alloys, in which they measured stress-strain curves
with and without hydrogen. The postulate that the damage was caused
by this superabundance of vacancies was demonstrated by the fact
that they could outgas the hydrogen from the specimen, and then see


the stress-strain curve would return to the hydrogen case, not to the
pure case.

This was regarded as evidence that the hydrogen produces damage
and then, if you remove it from the specimen, you do not recover the
hydrogen-free mechanical properties. That's very startling and striking,
because it means hydrogen is not actually involved in the fracture
process or the damage process at all. It’s involved in producing the
superabundance of vacancies, which then themselves are actually the
