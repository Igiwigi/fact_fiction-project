J. C. W. HUMFREY ON THE EFFECTS OF STRAIN

metal, but that in the centre there was simply the upper crust, about $ inch to
4 inch in thickness, and this could be easily cut away from the surrounding portions. The crystals forming the erust fell away from one another to a certain extent when
unsupported by the metal beneath. This was due to the well-known fact that the
metallic impurities form a eutectic with part of the lead and collect in the crystalline
boundaries. This eutectic has a lower freezing-point than the pure lead, and hence
remains molten after the main mass has solidified. â€˜lhe boundaries are, therefore,
lines of weakness, and the crystals tend to fall apart when the supporting metal
below is poured away.
