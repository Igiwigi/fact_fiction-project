It is a well-known fact that the madder root is not well adapted for the purposes of
dyeing until it has attained a growth of from eighteen months to three years, and
that after being gathered and dried it gradually improves for seyeral years, after
which it again deteriorates. During the time when left to itself, especially if in a
state of powder, it increases in weight and bulk, in consequence probably of absorp-
tion of moisture from the air, and some chemical change is effected, which, though
not attended by any striking phenomena, is sufficiently well indicated by its results. There are few chemical investigations that bave thrown any light on the nature of
the process which takes place during this lapse of time, and in fact most of the at-
tempts to do s0 have merely consisted of arguments based on analogy. It has been
surmised that the process is one of oxidation, and that the access of atmospheric air
is consequently necessary. We are indeed acquainted with cases, in which substances
of well-defined character and perfectly colourless, as for instance orcine and hema-
toxyline, are converted by the action of oxygen, or oxygen and alkalies combined,
into true colouring matters.
