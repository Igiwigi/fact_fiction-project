208 JOHN WALTON ON CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE

A “dichotomy ”’ of the frond is present in both fertile specimens of Rhacopteris,
and is a remarkable character in view of the fact that the sterile fronds are, so far as we
know, always unforked. It is possible that this arrangement was derived by an arrest
of the apex of the frond and by the vigorous growth of two lateral pinn, an explanation
which, as will be shown later, is thoroughly justified when applied to certain other Lower
Carboniferous fronds.

(d) Rhacopteris circularis, sp. nov. (Plate 16, figs. 5, 6, 7, 8; Plate 17, figs. 13, 14.)

Frond pinnate, linear-lanceolate, rachis fairly stout, with fine longitudinal striations
and with a short expanded region at the base. Pinnules distant near the base of the
frond but overlapping farther up, alternate or opposite, set obliquely to the rachis,
but not overlapping it. Margin of pinnules entire, more rarely crenulate or lobed.
Pinnules circular to semi-flabelliform, contracted at the base to form a short footstalk.
