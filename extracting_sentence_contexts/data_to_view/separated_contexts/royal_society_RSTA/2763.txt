We define map C: R° x R° > R° requiring that z = C(x, y) is a vector satisfying
det[x, y,v] =J(z,v), for arbitrary v € R. (6.5)

As it is easy to show
z=C(x,y) =J(x x y). (6.6)

This is why one can interpret it as a vector product in pseudo-Euclidean space R°. More
importantly, one can easily check that R° with bracket [x, y] := C(x,y) is a Lie algebra. Later we will need the following facts. Lemma 6.1. Let x,y € R° and z=C(x, y) £0.
