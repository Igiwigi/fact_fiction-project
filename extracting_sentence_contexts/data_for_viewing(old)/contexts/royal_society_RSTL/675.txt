vessels at sea; also to suggest new combinations, by which
the approved qualities of vessels may be extended, their faults
amended, or defects supplied. These several objects, and others
connected with them, have employed the attention of many
eminent theorists, by whose discoveries naval architecture has
been greatly benefited ; yet the progress made toward esta-
blishing a general theory, founded on the laws of motion, has
not been adequate to what might be expected from the abi-
lities of the writers on this subject, and the laborious attention
they have bestowed upon it. Although all results deduced by
strict geometrical inference from the laws of motion, are
found, by actual experience, to be perfectly consistent with
matter of fact, when subjected to the most decisive trials, yet,
in the application of these laws to the subject in question, dif-
ficulties often occur, either from the obscure nature of the
conditions, or the intricate analytical operations arising from
them, which either render it impracticable to obtain a solu-
tion, or, if a result is obtained; it is expressed in terms 80
involved and complicated, as to'become in a manner useless,
as to any practical purpose. These imperfections in the theory
of vessels, are amongst the causes which have contributed to
