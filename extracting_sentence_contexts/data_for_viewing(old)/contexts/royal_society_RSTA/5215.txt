meridional mixing of the material in the two cases, and provides an effective forcing over a larger
area than that in which active seeding is assumed to occur. Note that while we only display the


seeding functions for summer and winter solstice, there will be a gradual transition between the
two throughout the calendar year. The ice nucleation spectrum of the seeding IN was based on
classical nucleation theory [11] with a freezing threshold of 105% [2], as has for example been
suggested for the artificial IN bismuth tri-iodide (Bil3). Note that the seeding IN did not affect
mixed-phase clouds in the simulations.

No seeding is introduced in regions where the sun is directly overhead at noon, because in
these regions the reduction in sunlight reflected due to cirrus thinning exceeds the increased
longwave radiation escaping to space, yielding a net warming effect. The fact that the optically
thickest tropical cirrus clouds may have a cooling effect as measured at the TOA has previously
been reported for radiative transfer calculations [17]. The climate responses to the cirrus seeding
were obtained by comparing the equilibrated seeded simulations with the control simulation,
designed to be slightly warmer than the present and to have a nearly ice-free summer Arctic. An
ice-free summer Arctic has been characterized as an event that would be perceived as alarming
enough for CEMs to be seriously considered [18]. A nearly ice-free summer Arctic was recently
suggested to occur between 2020 and 2060 [19,20].

3. Results

In the control simulations, the relative importance of homogeneous versus heterogeneous ice
nucleation (figure 2a) is largely controlled by the presence of mineral dust particles. Compared
