halved by making use of a short list of known lines of known impurities, without
bringing in the complete wave-length tables for Cu, Mg, Mn or Ni, is a remarkable
vindication of the general correctness of the tabulated rotations, and suggests that
some of the other outstanding cases may perhaps be capable of a similar simple
interpretation.*

Duplicate readings of about 180 lines were available for the quartz before and after
regrinding. The rotations of the two series are slightly divergent, since the rotatory
power of the quartz was increased to the extent of about 1 part in 25,000 by regrinding.
In order to render available the long series of rotatory powers which were measured
before the quartz was reground, a smooth series of differences was deduced from the
formule which express the two series of readings, and these differences can be applied to
correct the rotations of the old series. Special attention is directed to the fact that the
correction for regrinding must be applied both to the observed and to the calculated
rotations of the older series in order to give correct values for the lines in question. The
concordance of the old and new series can be judged by making use of the tabulated
corrections for regrinding, or by comparing the differences between the observed
rotations and those calculated from the corresponding formule for the two series of
readings.

When this was done, it was found that the errors in the two series were predominantly
parallel, Â¢.g., the two series would show three pairs of positive errors, followed by one
pair of negative errors and a further pair of positive errors, with only one pair of errors
of opposite sign. Various explanations might be given of this clearly-established
parallelism. hus, if the systematic errors were greater than the casual errors, both
