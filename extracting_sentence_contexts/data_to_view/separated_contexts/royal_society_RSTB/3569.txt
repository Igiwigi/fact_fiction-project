Observations on the giant fibres of Halla and the
earthworm are directly opposed to the view that the nerve elements in these fibres
have undergone degeneration, The structures which E1si¢ observed in the giant
fibres and regarded as degenerating nerve fibres are, as shown by FRIEDLANDER
(1891, p. 210, et seg.), folds and processes of the sheath of the giant fibre which are
especially obvious when the latter is contracted, but disappear when the giant fibre
is stretched.

Ill. Tae Grant Freres REGARDED AS NoN-NERVOUS ELEMENTS ON ACCOUNT OF
THEIR STAINING REACTIONS. The denial of the nervous nature of the giant fibres has depended, in at least three
cases, upon the fact that the methods usually adopted for staining ordinary nerve
cells and fibres failed to stain these peculiar fibres. According to Semper (1876, p. 202, footnote) Leydig’s fibres are not true nerve
fibres, as is apparent by their reaction to stains; those of Nais* do not stain with
gold chloride and stain with carmine only with difficulty.
