firmly related to language and therefore to symbols. As a fitness in different contexts. Spontaneous proto-numerical

consequence, all creatures unable to use language and capability could therefore be considered as a biologically


based knowledge system that might have originated
from adaptation to the external world under specific evol-
utionary pressures. However, alternative explanations
sustaining that discrimination is founded on numerical
cues (e.g. overall area, volume, perimeter, surface area)
should be considered and eliminated, and here we come
to the second point, (ii), as raised by Davis & Pérusse [26].
In fact, changes in number correlate with changes in other
continuous-quantity cues, such as contour length, filled
area, surface area or volume. All these continuous-quantity
variables, precisely because they covary with numbers, are
also called ‘continuous variables’ or ‘continuous extents’.
Unless continuous-quantity variables are controlled, it is
impossible to conclude that discrimination is based on
numerical cues.

Even if an increasing number of studies in the compara-
tive literature are focused on proto-numerical abilities, some
aspects have nevertheless been poorly considered; namely,
(i) whether animals can discriminate solely on the basis of
