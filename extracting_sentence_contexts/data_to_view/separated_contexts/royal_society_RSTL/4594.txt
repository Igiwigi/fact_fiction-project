MAGNETIC DECLINATION, AT DIFFERENT PERIODS OF THE DAY. 639

For the mean Diurnal Variation, it is manifestly indifferent whether the secular
change be eliminated or not ; the line DD retains in either case its position and
form unchanged, for the sum of the monthly corrections for secular change in every
case ==0. If, therefore, the Annual Fariations were $ubstituted for the annual
ranges in the dark vertical lines in Plate XXVIL., we have reason to believe that a
correct representation would be given of what would be the facts of the Annual and
Diurnal Variations if no secular change whatsoever existed; or if a secular change
were to take place (as has recently been the case in Britain) in the opposite direction
to that which previously prevailed, and were eliminated by the same process. But when the vertical lines of Annual Variation are thus placed on the Diurnal
Variation, projected as in Plate XXVII. according to its mean declination-value, the
complexity occasioned by the two phenomena being viewed together is considerable,
and is greatly increased when, as in Plate XXVI.
