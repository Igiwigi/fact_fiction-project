M>V ®V, can be
approximated by standard weak solutions to the Euler equations thanks to ‘convex integration’
tools [8]. (We also refer to [1,9] for a discussion about the connections between such a Vlasov-type
formulation, the concept of ‘sharp measure-valued solutions’ to the Euler equations and the older
concept of ‘measure-valued solutions’.)

It is important to note that equations (1.5), (1.6) can also be thought of as the highly singular
limit of the well-known gravitational Vlasov—Poisson system,

Of (t,x, €) + Vx > (EF (t,x, €)) + Ve - (E(t, xf (t,x,€)) =0,  (t,x,€) € [0,T] x D x R? (1.8)

as € | 0. In sharp contrast with the Vlasov—Poisson system, for which the IVP is well-posed,
the limit equations are not well-posed in the usual sense [10], although there is a set of initial
conditions, defined by a suitable ‘Penrose—Rayleigh’ type condition around, which the IVP is
presumably well-posed [11]. As a matter of fact, the study of the limiting process is very delicate
and is an active field of research, for which we refer, as a very recent reference, to [12]. The Vlasov—
Poisson system itself admits a ‘multi-stream formulation’ that has been used for a while, for
instance by Grenier in [13] and recently by Baradat [12] (at least in the framework of Plasma
Physics for which ¢ is negative). The corresponding ‘multi-stream’ (pressure-less) Euler—Poisson
system (MEPS) reads

ac+V-q=0, c=c(t,x,a)>0, q=4q(t,x,a)e RY, (1.10)

Let us now sketch a physical interpretation of these equations.
