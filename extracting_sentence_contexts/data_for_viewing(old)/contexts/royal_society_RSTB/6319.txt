socket of the right maxilla, and a small replacing-tooth is seen pressed against the
root of the first incisor in the left dentary. The section cut through specimen B
exposed a replacing-tooth which appears to be in the process of eruption just behind
the first incisor of the right premaxilla. In neither specimen are the post-canine teeth
well preserved but a point of interest in specimen B is the fact that the sixth tooth
does not appear to have erupted in the right maxilla.

Specimen C has very large alvecli for the first post-canines and, while the tooth is
missing in the right side, there is apparently a replacing-tooth half erupted in the
left. Also the third teeth in both sides have the appearance of being incompletely
erupted, and have their centre cusps rather larger in proportion to the main cusps
in the adjacent teeth. The suggested interpretation of this dentition is that the
