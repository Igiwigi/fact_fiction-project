findings [61] were presented.

In terms of hydrodynamics, the latter presentation [61] implies use of a sophisticated
numerical model for the nonlinear shallow-water wave equations (NSWEs) with seven levels
of nested grids, from 4320m to 20m. The model is not referred to by name. It is not
known if it was benchmarked or tested according to world standards [8]. The fact that the
United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) Pacific Marine
Environmental Laboratory (PMEL) routinely runs analyses with the NSWE code Method of
Splitting Tsunami (MOST) [63]—when developing reference inundation models for at-risk
locations at 10m resolution notwithstanding—the complexity of the small port geometry
fronting the NPP and the local bathymetry should had suggested a much finer near-shore
grid. A 20m resolution, as apparently used by TEPCO, can hardly resolve the details of the
breakwater in front of the plant, and additional analyses ought to have been considered,
at least in terms of maximum run-up. To wit what was possible then, the resolution of
the fine grid in the simulations [64] performed in 2010 for the old port of Chania, Greece
was 2m. The approximately 325 x 630m? old Port of Chania is about the same size as the
approximately 535 x 685m? port, whose seawall was presumably built to protect Fukushima
Dai-ichi.
