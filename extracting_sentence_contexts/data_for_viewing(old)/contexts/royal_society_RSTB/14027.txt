Figure 2. Phylogenetic tree of animals expanded along the lineage that produced humans. Branch points represent some of the key divergences between different
lineages, with timing estimates based on the fossil record and molecular clock analyses [19-21]. Thick lines indicate the presence of relevant fossil data (https://
paleobiodb.org), and small rectangles indicate the latest estimated timing of the innovations listed in the boxes. Many branch points and lineages are omitted for
clarity. The silhouettes of example species are from http://phylopic.org.

key structural and functional innovations. Note that the order- 3 Evo | ution of the vert eb rate ‘Ba u pla n ’
ing of the branches in the vertical direction is arbitrary, and here :

they are arranged to make room for the boxes describing the
innovations of highest interest for the human lineage. This pro-
duces what appears on the right edge like a ‘Scala Nature’ from
sponges to humans, but it is not meant to imply a scale of pro-
gress towards higher complexity. In fact, such a tree could be
constructed for any species of interest, resulting in a schematic
where that species is at the top.

The boxes in figure 2 summarize my current attempt at
reconstructing a sequence of evolutionary changes that will
be used to guide the rest of this article. In an earlier publication
[8], | focused on early stages from the first multicellular animals
to stem vertebrates. Here I will only summarize these briefly in
order to leave more space to discuss later stages, particularly
the transitions from the first terrestrial tetrapods to mammals
and then primates.
