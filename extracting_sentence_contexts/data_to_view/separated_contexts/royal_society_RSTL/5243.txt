Wacxer and Levckarpr have already pointed out* that the power of motion
possessed by the spermatozoon is elosely connected with the completion of its struc-
ture and composition, and is gradually evolved as the development of this body
proceeds. This power of motion I shall presently endeavour to show I regard as the
visible exponent of its fecundatory force, or form of vitality, and that a similar power
is evolved concurrently with this in the gpermatozoon in the contents of the egg, the
evolution in both being more or less influenced by temperature, according to the
species. These facts are well shown both in the Frog and Toad. Several pairs of Frogs were collected on the 2nd of March, when the temperature
of the season was low, and strong easterly winds prevailed, during which Frogs
seldom spawn, except in very sheltered places. As one female had passed some eggs,
and believing that the others were equally advanced, I selected a pair, which
appeared to be the most mature, for experiment.
