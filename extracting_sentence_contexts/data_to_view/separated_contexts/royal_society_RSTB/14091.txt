These membranes resemble EEMs in
insects so closely, that they have even received the
same names: serosa and amnion. However, the origin and
development of the scorpion membranes is unclear. Therefore, in fact, no comparison with the origin and devel-
opment of the insect membranes can be made yet. In
addition, the insect amnion and serosa are required to protect
the developing embryo against desiccation [5], whereas the
scorpion membranes are unlikely to have a similar function,
because the embryos develop within the body of the
mother and therefore are not at risk of desiccation. Given the recent trends in chelicerate phylogeny recon-
struction [85], it is also interesting to ask whether the
investigation of extraembryonic tissue in chelicerates can con-
tribute to this discussion.
