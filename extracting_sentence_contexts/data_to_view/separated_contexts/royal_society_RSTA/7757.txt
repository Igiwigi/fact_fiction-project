These reduce to
the values given by Samnt-VENANT if we take 8 = 1 and «= 0. But on calculation,
after using the values of the strain components given by (1), we find that the body-stress
equations are not satisfied if we take Satnt-VENANT’s values. In fact, we get

Oxx oxy Oxz

are + a rAr2x,

of the component displacements.
