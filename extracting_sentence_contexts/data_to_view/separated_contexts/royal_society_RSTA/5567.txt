By
contrast, smooth-wall pipe flow may be idealized by taking k = 0 and it is observed that f(Re) > 0
as Re — oo [31-36]. Roughly, the laminar value f ~ 32/Re is observed for Re < 10%, followed by
the Blasius law f ~cRe~/* for 10° < Re $ 10°, and then the von Karman-Prandtl Law [37,38]
given implicitly by 1/,/f =alog(Re,/f) + b for Re = 10°, with suitable constants a, b, c. In fact,
the above summary only roughly states the most common interpretation of the observations
and there are many refinements and alternative proposals. In particular, there is an old idea of
Prandtl and others that the drag may be power-law f(Re) ~ Re~? with an exponent p(Re) that tends
slowly to 0 as Re — oo; for example, see [23], Ch XXa for the classical literature and [39,40] for a
modern reincarnation. Despite intense ongoing discussion of the details, the observations support
unequivocally the fact that f(Re) decays much slower than the laminar rate 1/Re as Re — oo.
