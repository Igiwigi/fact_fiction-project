And three in'par-

were diſſipated, or dejiroyed; and a fmall part of an
iron rod melted next the points of one of them;
and alſo at the ſeveral crooked ends of the rods be-
low, where they were hooked on to each other,
and formed the conduQtor belonging to Mr, Maine
in North America, But as thole letters are long,
and contain ſeveral other curious facts, I ſhall re-
lerve them, together with ſome further obſervations
upon the nature and power of that reſting princt-
þle, which is found to a&t fo ſenſibly againlt the
attacks of the electric fluid, or lightning, to fome
future difſertation,

"There is no building, that I know of, more ex-
poſed to this kind of danger, than the Edayſtone
Lighthouſe, as it ſtands upon a rock in the fea, ſe-
veral miles from land. 'The fixing of a conductor
to that building, was thought highly proper ; and
the fixing of a point upon 1t, as highly improper. It was therefore reſolved upon to put up a conductor
without a point, that no more lightning might be
unneceflarily ſollicited to the building, and that all
the lightening, which accidentally fell on it, might
be conveyed away without injuring it, This con-
duQtor was fixed twelve years ago, and the building
has ſince received no injury from lightning #,

There is another edifice of great conſequence,
I mean St. Pauls Church, which ſtands much ex-
poted, from” its heighth, to accidents by light-
ning.
