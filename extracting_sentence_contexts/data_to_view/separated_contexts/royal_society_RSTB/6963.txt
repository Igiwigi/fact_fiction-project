In the majority of
animals disturbances of parturition were seen, many of the animals dying in labour. However, since about one-third of the guinea-pigs with these lesions delivered themselves
normally, it was felt that the results could not be offered as convincing evidence that the
secretory activity of the neurohypophysis played an essential part in labour. In view of
the fact that the pars distalis was not subjected to direct interference and that the median
eminence and infundibular stem were denervated, it would seem that these experiments
are of greater value in the analysis of parturition than the work quoted above in which
operative hypophysectomy was employed. HyYPER-FUNCTIONAL STATES AND THE OXYTOCIC ‘HORMONE’ The effect of increased activity of the neurohypophysis on the uterus had received little
attention until recently.
