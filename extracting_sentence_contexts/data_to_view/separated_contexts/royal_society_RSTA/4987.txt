Moreover, under the impacting sphere it appeared to densify
considerably. However, during the rebound of the projectile, the densification partially recovered
and then, as soon as the projectile left the surface of the glass, radial and lateral cracks formed, as
would be expected from the elastic/plastic model given in ยง2b. The ring of material that detaches
during the rebound of the impacting sphere had, in fact, piled up around the sphere, as if it flowed
plastically [41], during the loading part of the impact (figure 5, frame 3) and then detached from
the glass surface as the steel sphere started its rebound. The second aspect of this work is about the variation of the Hertzian cone crack semi-included
angle in fused silica when it is impacted at normal incidence with 1mm diameter steel, glass
and sapphire spheres in the velocity range 15-340ms-1. It is clear from figures 6 and 7 that the
semi-included angle of the cone cracks decreases systematically with increasing impact velocity



of the projectiles.
