The injection of energy in LV99 is assumed to happen at a given scale and the inverse cascade
is not considered in the theory. Therefore, it is not unexpected that the measured dependence on
the turbulence scale differs from the predictions. In fact, it is slightly more shallow compared with
the LV99 predictions (figure 4b). Figure 5a shows the dependence of the reconnection rate on explicit uniform viscosity obtained
from the isothermal simulations of the magnetic reconnection in the presence of turbulence [34]. The open symbols show the reconnection rate for the laminar case when there was no turbulence
driving, whereas filled symbols correspond to the mean values of reconnection rate in the
presence of saturated turbulence.
