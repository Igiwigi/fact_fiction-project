considerable enough to make the determination of the precise way in which the
coefficient changed with changes in the velocity a matter of the greatest difficulty. We
have been able to draw only very roughly curves connecting the coefficient p with the

relative velocity of the sliding surfaces. These all agree in showing that S, or the rate

of change of the coefficient of friction relatively to change of velocity, becomes greater
as the yelocity becomes less. This being 80 it is perfectly possible that at velocities
below 0:0002 foot per second, which is the lowest limit to which our observation may
be taken as extending, a considerable further increase of the coefficient may take place
before motion entirely ceases.

It is in fact highly probable that in those cases in which the static coefficient of
friction is greater than the kinetic (that is, the coefficient which is observed when the

surfaces are moving at a moderate speed), the latter gradually increases when the
velocity becomes extremely small, 80 as to pass without discontinuity into the former.
The experiments of CouLoMB show that the friction between surfaces at rest is itself not
constant, but increases as the time of rest is prolonged. It seems doubtful whether
this result is due to a real change in the static coefficient or not ; but if it is we may
8nppose that not only does the coefficient of friction increase continuously as the state
of the surfaces changes from motion to rest, but continues for a time to increase after
