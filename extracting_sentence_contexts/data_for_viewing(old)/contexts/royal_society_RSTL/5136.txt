S 77. On examining the glass by the fourth method, it was found that the dispersion
S commenced nearly where the dispersed light ended, that is, the lowest refrangibility
& of the rays capable of being dispersed was nearly the same as the highest refrangibility
of the rays constituting the dispersed beam exhibited by white light as a whole. The
Â£ dispersion appeared indeed to commence a little earlier, at about the refrangibility of
TL the fourth dark band in the spectrum of the entire dispersed beam. When the small
S prism was held to the eye with one hand, while the small lens in the board was gra-
dually moved with the other, in a direction from the red to the violet, through the
A part of the spectrum where the dispersion commenced, it was found that the region
of the first four bands was lighted up almost simunltaneously, the whole field of view
having been previously dark. When the lens was moved a very little further on the
dispersed beam with its five bands was formed complete. Indeed the whole five ap-
peared almost simultaneously. Speaking approximately, and in fact with almost
perfect accuracy, we may say that if white light be conceived to be decomposed into
two portions, the first containing rays of all refrangibilities up to that of the fixed
line b, or thereabouts, and the second containing rays of all greater refrangibilities,
the dispersed light produced by white light as a whole belongs exclusively to the first
portion ; and yet, were the bottle illuminated by the first portion alone, no dispersion
whatsoever would be produced, whereas were it illuminated by the second portion
