pathogen conflict [20,50,105]. Although the original proposals [106,107] were met with skepticism [108,109], of the handful
of incompatibilities for which the underlying genes have been identified, many seem to have evolved via conflicts. Yet, the
relative importance of conflict, other types of selection and other processes, in the evolution of incompatibility alleles remains
unknown.

Third, many species exhibit genetic variation for reproductive isolation. This variation can exist as segregating
incompatibilities within a species [50-52], or as a genetic polymorphism for the ability of a species to cross to a close relative
(e.g. [53-64] reviewed in [18]). The relative importance of polymorphic incompatibilities in speciation has been debated, and
their contribution will depend on the allele frequencies of each incompatibility allele [18].
