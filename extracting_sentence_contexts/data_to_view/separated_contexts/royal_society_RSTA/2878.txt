A :
+ The present theory shows that C,, the temperature constant for diffusion, is a different multiple o
the mutual potential of two molecules in contact from that in the case of Cy, the temperature constant ft
viscosity. This fact was not indicated in SUTHERLAND’S investigation ; see Phil. Mag.’ (5), 38, p. 1, 1894


480 MR. S. CHAPMAN ON THE KINETIC THEORY OF A GAS

As in the case of the coefficient of viscosity, we proceed to give the values of the
molecular radii (according to the two theories of elastic spherical molecules, with and
without attraction) calculated from the coefficient of diffusion.
