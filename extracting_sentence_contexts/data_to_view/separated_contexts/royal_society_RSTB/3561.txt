Discussion of Affinities.â€”Before a paleeobotanist can discuss the affinities of a fossil,
he must either himself have considerable knowledge of allied modern groups, or must
have such knowledge on the part of another, available for his use. Now, it is
essential to point out here that there is perhaps no branch of modern botany in a
more chaotic condition than that dealing with the anatomy of Angiosperms. The
Gymnosperms are few in number, and the facts have been sufficiently marshalled to
be of use. Angiosperms are enormously numerous, and the facts, incompletely
collected, are not marshalled at all. It is, therefore, entirely premature to attempt
any such discussion of the possible affinities of this fossil, as one could give, let us say,
to a new Poroxylon or Arvaucaria.
