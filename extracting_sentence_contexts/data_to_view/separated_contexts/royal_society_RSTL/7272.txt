fig. 14). This is all T have been able to ascertain concerning

82 structures, and it is from what I have seen in Tylenchus tritics only, that I have
Pn led to infer as a probability that the similar vessels met with in the other genera,
ney the same position in the general cavity of the body as I have proved them to do
nZthis gpecies. These four genera are further allied to one another by the fact that

y alone of the land and freshwater Nematoids yet discovered possess any modification
f the ventral gland before described, and that it exhibits essentially the same formation
k all the species of these four genera, whilst this formation differs s0mewhat from the
OmMMON type. The other vessels in the Nematoids were, I believe, structures first noticed by
SCHNEIDERF in Ascaris lumbricoides, though neither at that time nor at the present}
loes he take this view of their nature.
