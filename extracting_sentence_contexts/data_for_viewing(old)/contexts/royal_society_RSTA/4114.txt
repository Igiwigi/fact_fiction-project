superhydrophobicity.

Collembola have recently been investigated in detail. As springtails respire through their
body surface, it is essential to keep this surface dry and clean, as otherwise they risk
suffocation. The remarkable surfaces (figure 32) consist of a primary structure of rhombical
or hexagonally arranged granules, as well as bristles. Additional secondary granules may
exist in several species. The variation of these patterns seems to be an adaptation to the
habitat [114]. The chemical composition, however, is similar to other arthropods [104]. In addition
to a perfect superhydrophobicity, the collembola surfaces also repel a broad range of organic
solvents and may resist pressures up to six bar [115]. The most surprising fact still is that
the superhydrophobicity is purely structurally determined and independent of the chemical
basis [115,116]. For this reason, the highly complex surface topography exhibiting overhanging
surface structures with undercuts evolved. First attempts have been made to transfer these
properties to technical materials [117,118].

Some aquatic insects have wettable surfaces such as diving beetles (Dytiscus) or giant water
bugs (Belastomidae); however, the tracheal endings are superhydrophobic to ensure the uptake
of air at the water surface.

Many aquatic insects hold an air layer that functions as a plastron for gas exchange
[98,119-121]: for example Aphelocheirus aestivalis [54], which spends all its life in an air pocket
on river bottoms.
