the coefficients of y,', &c., are those found there whether «* be zero or not.

In the same way for the third column, with a, a", taken into account, the equations
become

(@r41— 3) m—Y = 0,

(p41 — Progr) + (4p—9,") Hy — Yr — Apap — A % = 0,

and just as before the first equation in which «,, occurs with a non-vanishing coefficient
is the one following the equation from which @,° first does not vanish out identically,
viz., Z..+,-2; While #, will occur first in the equation homologous to the Y equation
in which @,, first occurred, viz., Z,4,-1; in fact, in Z,,4p-2, %. will occur multiplied by
the left-hand member of Z,4,-3 with 0,°+1 put for 6°, and in Z.4p-2, @_ will be
multiplied by the left-hand member of Y,4,-3 with 6,°+1 put for 0,°: both these
factors are other than zero.

Thus «” can be chosen to satisfy Z,4,-s, and subsequently a” to satisfy Z.4)-2,
bi the preceding equations are quite independent of them both ; just as for y, then,

.. are given in succession without ambiguity.

pees the remainder of the first ¢, columns in just the same way, all the sinmeiit
of these columns are found in succession, and the solution is complete as far as these
columns are concerned,
