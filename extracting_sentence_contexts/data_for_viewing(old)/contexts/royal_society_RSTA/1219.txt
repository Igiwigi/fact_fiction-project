Iterating this argument, we conclude that if f € ce ), for every t > 0 the function T(f)f belongs
to cRe(RN ) and for every multi-index a there exists c = c(a) > 0 such that

c
D*T(Hflloo S jaya flee O<ts1 (3.6)

while the sup norm of all the derivatives of T(t)f decay exponentially as t— oo if all the
eigenvalues of B have negative real part.

The semigroup T(t) is neither compact, see [7, Example 5.4], nor analytic if B40, see [6,
Lemma 3.3], in C,(RN). Theorem 4.2 of [7] and the counterexample in [6] show that it is neither
compact nor analytic even in Co(RY). In fact, the counterexample in [6] shows that, in general,
T(t) does not map Co (RY) into the domain of the infinitesimal generator Ag of T(t) in Co (RN), and
therefore T(t) is not differentiable in Co(R'Y). Moreover, if B 4 0 then ||T(f) — T(s)|| = 2 fors At and
the semigroup is not norm-continuous, see [8].


Still, the representation formula for T(t) easily yields that for every f € Cy (RN, C) the function
(t,x) +> T(E)f(x) is continuous in [0, +00) x RN, and therefore for all 4 with positive real part the
operators R,, defined by
