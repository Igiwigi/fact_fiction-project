The Teeth are now considered to be permeated by an infinity of fine tubes, which
are supposed to have the function of conducting from the surface of the vascular
pulp, a nutrient fluid, which is distributed over the snbstance of the tooth. In this
way may be explained the manner in which the teeth change their colour during dis-
eases, being impregnated by the various fluids circulating in the system#. From the preceding observations by myself, and from those made by the physiolo-
gists whose writings I have quoted, I think it is established, as a general law in
Animal Physiology, that certain tissues are capable of being nourished without the
presence of blood-vessels within them : it has been shown that all these tissnes are
surrounded by large blood-vessels, which appear to have no other function than of
supplying to them a nutrient fluid ; and the way in which this nutrient fluid is con-
veyed into the substance of these tissues bas been also pointed out.

* Recent investigators have thrown 80 much light upon the structure and the mode of growth of the Zpi-

dermoid Class of non-vascular tissues, that (as is apparent) I have added but few new facts in this department
of my researches,

The analogy between the extra-vascular animal and the vegetable tissnes is ma-
nifest. The application of the above-named law to the study of Surgery, in reference to
the causes of the prolongation of vessels into the extra-yascular tissues, and to the
measures to be adopted for the prevention and cure of those diseases which are de-
pendent thereon ; and to Pathology, in the investigation of the nature of morbid
structures, particularly of those elasses which contain no vessels,â€”will, I feel certain,
be productive of interest and great advantage. In conclusion, I have to thank my estimable friend Mr.
