93, Our chief’ conclusions, so far, may he thus summarised :—



THEORY OF ELECTROMAGNETISM. 763

(1.) If P be assumed to be dependent upon ¥, the theory of reversibility suffices to
explain all the known experimental facts of thermoelectricity. (2.) If, as there is some reason to believe, P be independent of V, the main thermo-
electric effects must be explained on the theory of reversibility, but the Tuomson effect
and the thermoelectric effects observed in a cireuit of a single metal differently stressed
in different parts must be explained on the theory of irreversibility.
