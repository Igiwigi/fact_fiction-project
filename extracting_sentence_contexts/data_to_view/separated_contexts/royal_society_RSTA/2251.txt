But, as in classical physics,
probabilities require a sample space of mutually exclusive possibilities, one and only one of which
is thought to take place in a particular run of the experiment. In quantum theory, a sample space
is always a PDL. The orthogonality of the projectors ensures that only one, and the fact that they
sum to the identity means at least one, of these possibilities will occur in any particular situation. In classical physics, the choice of a sample space is usually quite straightforward, and if two or
more spaces are of interest in some situation it causes no difficulty, as one can always combine
them. But in quantum mechanics one needs to make different choices depending on what aspect
of a situation one is interested in.
