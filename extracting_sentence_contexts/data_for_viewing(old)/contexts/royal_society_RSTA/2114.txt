Te Qcom(In(g"e*) — In gcom) | = TH(o"Q) — Tr@com = 0 (6.12)
and
Tr(e'o*) =Tr'Tr’°(e!e*) = 1, (5.13)
and (5.10) results in
S$, +S2>S. (5.14)

If the entropy of the compound system does not decompose into the partial entropies of the
decomposed system, it is according to (5.14) smaller than the sum of the partial entropies. The

!Thermodynamical quantities of the bipartite system are written in bold font.


descriptions of a system as a compound one or as a decomposed one are different, a fact which is
denoted as compound deficiency [8].

(b) Equations of motion

Using the calculation rules of appendix A and the decomposition of the Hamiltonian (4.1), the
modified von Neumann equation (4.11)

. i °
Boom =— 5 [OH +H? +74"), Qcom + Gcom (6.15)

results in two equations of motion for the traced density operators of the subsystems by taking
(A 8) into account
