integument ; while it certainly affords no proof of carpellary nature. There is not
the slightest reason to suppose, in the general morphology of Angiosperms, that
a syncarpous ovary-wall, itself a secondary intercalated growth-zone, which replaces
the original carpels, should necessarily retain the midrib bundles of the carpels after
these had been completely lost as distinct primordia. The new syncarpous structure
might have had a new bundle-system of its own, just as a gamophyllous perianth, or
gamopetalous corolla, does not necessarily continue the midrib bundles of the
original free members. Also, it must be borne in mind that the total distance for
which this plexus travels is very short and small in comparison with the size of the
tissues composing it. Bundle-schemes constructed in fine lines, which give no clue to
the relation of the component elements to the adjacent cells, may readily create
a false impression; so that judgment may be suspended until cell drawings are
available. The fact which does emerge from these differing published accounts is
that the plexus is a fairly simple symmetrical bundle-meshwork confined to a
definite region. Its function is sufficiently obvious: it supplies the pyriform nucellus
with an evenly distributed water supply, as a girdle and four free strands symme-
trically arranged ; just as a very similar plexus does in the more extended ovule of
the ovulate flower ; and here again, when we know the importance of the function
of the system, the assumed phylogenetic value of the scheme, as indicative of
hypothetical carpels, appears not so much far fetched as completely beyond the
range of the evidence.

On the other hand, a floral form in which the gyneecium, originally composed of
free carpels, had not only passed on to a condition of complete synearpy, but had
even lost all outward sign of the original carpel members, and had subsequently
