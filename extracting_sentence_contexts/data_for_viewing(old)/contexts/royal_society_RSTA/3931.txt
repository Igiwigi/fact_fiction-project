One of the last frontiers of scientific research is the combination of Raman and SEM techniques aed

Fortunately, the role of analytical chemistry is not limited to the description of metallic alloys
and their degradation compounds. In fact, it must be considered that each archaeological object
has specific degradation problems and a customized restoration protocol has to be designed to
properly conserve it. For this reason, a further contribution of analytical research is to devise
experiments that help to predict the consequences of applying restoration treatments to a specific
object.

Several scientific articles have focused on the study of the effect of desalination baths applied to
iron-based archaeological items. Based on the literature, techniques such as ion chromatography
(IC) are often used to study the consequences of desalination treatments on artefacts with
conservation problems related to the infiltration of soluble salts [27].

In summary, from the discovery of an archaeological object until its cataloguing in a museum,
this research follows the conservation work of a unique iron artefact by using some of the most
