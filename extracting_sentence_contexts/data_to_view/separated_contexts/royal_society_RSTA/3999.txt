This becomes especially relevant if one
wants to use these materials in a commercial cooling device, as the magnetic field that can be
generated at reasonable costs is about 1 T [19], rather than the 5-14 T that are nowadays standard
fields available in commercial magnetometers based on superconducting coils [20].

Another metric, the refrigerant capacity (RC), also introduced by Wood & Potter [5], is rather 1S
popular [21], in particular for second-order MCE materials [22]. From the fact that the second [oS
law of thermodynamics requires that the entropy change at the cold side AS, cannot exceed the [3
entropy change at the hot side AS), they derive an expression for RC: : S

:

Wrev = Qn — Qe

with Wyey the reversible work, Q, and Q, the expelled and received heat at warm temperature
Th and cold temperature Tc, respectively, AT = Ty — Tc and AS = ASy = AS. In their paper, Th
and T¢ are rather ill defined, and it has become a general practice to take AT as the width at
half-maximum of a plot of AS as a function of the temperature [22]. Obviously, this metric is not
dimensionless and thus not a coefficient of performance (COP).
