MR. GROVE ON THE DECOMPOSITION OF WATER BY HEAT. 3

To ascertain the relation between the amount of radiant heat generated by the
same battery and wire in gases which presented striking differences as to the lumi-
nous effects of the platinum wire, an apparatus was prepared in which the bulb of a
thermometer was retained at a certain distance from the coil of wire ignited by a
battery of four cells, and exposed, first, to an atmosphere of hydrogen, and then to
one of atmospheric air, at the same temperature and pressure ; the thermometer rose
727 in five minutes in the hydrogen, and 15% in the air in the same time. Both the
heating and luminous effects appear therefore to be greater in atmospheric air
than in hydrogen. I cannot satisfactorily account for the differences shown in the
above table ; there appears a general tendency to greater ignition in the electro-
negative than in the combustible gases, but the facts are far too few to found a
generalization. I was at first inclined to regard the difference of effect in hydrogen
as analogous to the peculiarity mentioned by Less* respecting its convection of
s0und, but the parallel does not hold ; sound is transmitted imperfectly through rare-
fied air, and also through hydrogen ; on the contrary, the heat of the ignited wire is
most intense in the former, and least s0 in the latter; the heat is also very much
reduced in intensity in the compounds of hydrogen, ammonia and olefiant gas, or
even by a small admixture of hydrogen with another gas, such as nitrogen ; hydro-
gen, therefore, appears to have a peculiar and specific action in this respect.

I now pass to the consideration of the effects of the ignited wire on different gases.
The ignition was in every case raised to the fullest extent, and the gases after expo-
sure to it were carefully cooled down to their original temperature.
