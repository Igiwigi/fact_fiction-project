The act by which the resistance to combination is diminished, and the combining
power thus brought into greater activity, we call Chemical Induction ; and we specify
this as photo-chemical, thermo-chemical, electro-chemical, and idio-chemical, according
as light, heat, electricity, or pure chemical action is the active agent concerned in over-
coming the resistance. The mode of action of affinity, when separated from the influence of these resistances
to combination, that is, the law which regulates this force when all disturbing causes
are removed, is entirely unknown. Although the determination of this law, solving the
the most important problem of the science, appears in the present state of our know-
ledge Â«till to lie in the far distance, it is certainly not premature to search for facts which
may serve as starting-points in this field of investigation. The interesting relations in
which photo-chemical induction stands to this question have, therefore, attracted our

special attention.
