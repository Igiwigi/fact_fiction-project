The scratch showed light against a slightly
darker ground. :

We return to the light patches, such as are seen in fig. 19, Plate 16, which we have


AND PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF THIN METAL FILMS 81

called windows. The method of the scratch shows that these are not bare areas
but are covered with a layer which is much thinner than the original film: the
windows scatter more light and transmit less light than the bare glass. A curious
fact is illustrated by the comparison of fig. 21, Plate 16, taken by scattered light,
and fig. 22, Plate 16, by transmitted light. The background of fig. 21 is mottled,
to correspond to the light and dark patches in fig. 22 ; that is, light portions in the one
correspond to light portions in the other, and dark to dark. â€˜This means that the
windows scatter more light than the thicker parts of the film, a curious fact which
leaves plenty of room for conjecture. The temperature at which the windows make their first appearance has not been
definitely fixed.
