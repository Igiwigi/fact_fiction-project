After the protoplasm has left the central part of the shell there is no di
evidence, in decalcified specimens, as to the nature of the parent; but in specim
(some fifty or more) killed and decalcified at earlier stages of the reproductive p:
it is seen that the parent is in every case microspheric,

The fate of the microspheric form of Polystomella crispa (LiNN.) is, then, to gi
rise to megalospheric young.

In two examples of Rotalia Beccarii (Liyn.) the same process occurred. Th
parent in each case was microspheric.

The fact that the whole of the protoplasm of the parent is used in the production
of the young, and that these are all of one form, supports the view that the two
forms of the Foraminifera belong to different generations.

A fuller account of the process of reproduction, with what I am able to make out
of the nuclear changes, will be reserved for another paper.
