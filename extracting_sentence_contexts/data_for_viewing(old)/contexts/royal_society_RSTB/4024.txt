Of the other six experiments, three were made with considerably increased
percentages of oxygen in the air breathed, our object being to ascertain whether, by
increasing the alveolar oxygen pressure, we could abolish the secretory activity of the
lungs, and reduce to zero the difference between alveolar and arterial oxygen pressure.
In these experiments the average alveolar oxygen pressure was 102°6 mm. or just
above normal at about sea-level, and the average arterial oxygen pressure 114°8 mm.,
or 12°2 mm, higher. The difference was thus reduced to about a third, but not
completely abolished. That it should have been abolished completely in the course
of about half an hour was, perhaps, hardly to be expected.

In one experiment, as will be seen, the oxygen percentage was reduced, so that the
alveolar oxygen pressure was only 33°2 mm. In this experiment the subject was
quite comfortable, but there was slight hyperpnoea, as shown by the fact that the
alveolar CO, percentage had fallen distinctly and the respiratory quotient was high.
The colour of the subject’s face was also slightly-bluish, and he felt somewhat “ slack ”
just after the experiment. The oxygen pressure of the warmed and moistened
inspired air was 54°3 mm, (corresponding to a height of about 25,000 feet). The
arterial oxygen pressure found was 55'2 mm., or 22 mm. above the alveolar oxygen

pressure. At 55°2 mm. of oxygen pressure the blood would be 85 per cent. saturated,
or 11 per cent. less saturated than normal. Assuming that the circulation rate was
normal, and allowing for the increased percentage of hemoglobin in the blood, the
