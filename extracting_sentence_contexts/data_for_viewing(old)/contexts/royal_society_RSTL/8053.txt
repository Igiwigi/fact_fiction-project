Surface of the lung than on the internal ; they are collected into a common branch,

Arunning near to the outer margin of the ventral surface of each half of the lung; the
left branch is stronger than the right ; both unite near the anterior end, and on the right
side of the lung; its passage through the diaphragm and separate entrance into the

and this assertion seems to be borne out by the fact that it is provided with a true lung.
On the other hand, we must recollect that a similar belief was entertained with regard
