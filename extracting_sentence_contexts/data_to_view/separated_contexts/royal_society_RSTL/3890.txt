Our experiments have actually proved that this salt contains indeed 4 equi-
valents of water, and that this water is retained at. 100* C., the temperature at which
M. L1zsi6 dried his salt before submitting it to analysis. More recently M. ReprENBAcHER and M. WETHERELL have investigated the same
Sdarium- salt, but neither of them appears to have remarked the fact, that this sult loses
Srater between 100? and 200%. M. RepTrenBacueR analysed a salt which M. LigsiG
Had prepared himself. M. WerTHERELL examined a salt which he obtained as a
Secondary product in his researches on sulphate of ethyl.
