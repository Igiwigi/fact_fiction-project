the column index (k + 1)j, but in order to do that we need to rewrite the constraints in a different
way. First, we fix the row index i and define the set

Q={nEN| ik: Gje dx A n=(k+1j], (A4)
then we can write
(p+1)N
Vi=1...,N, VneQi, D> Adin(Y)mn— (Cin =0, (A5)
m=1

where the summations over / and r have been replaced by the summation over m=(I+1)r. We
. . . . 1)N
note that for m ¢ Q; the corresponding term in the sum vanishes, so we can write rer
Ymeg, The fact that we are only considering m,n € 2; suggests that we may consider the new
matrices Aj, Jj, 4% where the rows/columns corresponding to indices not in Q; are removed and

rewrite the previous equation as

Aw; — F,=0, (A6)

which can be readily solved by matrix inversion Aj = Kee. The elements in the row vector Aj
can then be remapped to corresponding non-zero values of (Ax); ;. We can informally say that we
are solving the Yule-Walker equations row-by-row and that, for each row, we are removing all
the columns corresponding to couplings that should be forced to zero.
