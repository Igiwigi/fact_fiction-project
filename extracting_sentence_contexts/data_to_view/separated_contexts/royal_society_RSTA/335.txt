The differences between the conditions k are thus modelled by the diagonal matrices Dx. PARAFAC is a major improvement to classical Gaussian factor analysis or PCA in the sense that
it can actually uniquely estimate the components even for Gaussian data. However, there is an
important restriction here, which is that the D, must be linearly independent, which intuitively


means that data matrices must be sufficiently different with respect to the scalings for different k. | 10 |
In fact, if all Dy were equal, the model would reduce an ordinary linear mixing like in (2.2). A combination of ICA with PARAFAC for estimation of (5.4) was proposed by Beckmann & a
Smith [33], by basically assuming that the S in the PARAFAC model in (5.4) is non-Gaussian, like : s
in ICA. This has the potential of improving estimation from what would be obtained by either ICA is
or PARAFAC alone.
