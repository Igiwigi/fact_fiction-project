The only other forms that exhibit radiating calcified lamelle that belong
exclusively to the sheath-cartilage are the various species of Cestracion (fig. 21,
p- 370). * This is not, however, to be taken as necessarily implying close aflinity
with Heptanchus; indeed, the fact that the characteristic number of rays in
Heptanchus is six, while in Cestracion it is eight, tells rather against it. The
fossil genera, such as Pal@ospinax, that are commonly regarded as allied to
Cestracion, although their centra have no radiating calcified laminz, may possibly
be degenerate, but the more probable explanation is that they branched off from
the parental stock prior to the evolution in the Cestracionts proper of the calcified
lamellee external to the double cone. * And possibly Orectolobus (see p. 396).
