However, it was
shown (SUTHERLAND and Maass, 1931) that when propylene and hydrogen chloride
are brought together at room temperature as gases and heated above the critical
temperatures of the mixture, no reaction occurs even when they are compressed to
a concentration as great as that of the liquid mixture slightly below the critical
temperature. The rate of reaction of the liquid mixture was found to increase with
rise in temperature in the usual manner up to the critical temperature, but was
found to be nil in the absence of the liquid phase. The acquirement of results of a
similar nature by the application of the same procedure to other systems has been
delayed owing to the fact that for most systems in which a homogeneous reaction
takes place in the liquid state the critical temperatures and pressures are so high as
to enhance greatly the experimental difficulties. An attempt to overcome these
difficulties is still in progress. In the meantime other investigations have been
undertaken with the object of finding a possible explanation for a discontinuity in
reaction rate at the critical temperature.
