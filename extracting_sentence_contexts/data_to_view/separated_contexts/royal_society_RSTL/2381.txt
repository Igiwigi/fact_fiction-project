The collected gas, when examined, was found to contain small por-
tions of nitrogen. This I attribute to the presence of air dissolved in the acid used
for decomposition. It is a well-known fact, that when bubbles of a gas but slightly
s0luble in water or s0lutions pass through them, the portion of this gas which is dis-
s0lved displaces a portion of that previously in union with the liquid: and s0, in the
decompositions under consideration, as the oxygen dissoives, it displaces a part of the
air, or at least of the nitrogen, previously united to the acid ; and this proceeds most
extensively with large plates, because the gas evolved at them is in the most favour-
able condition for solution. 720. With the intention of avoiding this s0lubility of the gases as much as poxssible,
I arranged the decomposing plates in a vertical position (707. 708.), that the bubbles
might quickly escape upwards, and that the downward currents in the fluid should
not meet ascending currents of gas.
