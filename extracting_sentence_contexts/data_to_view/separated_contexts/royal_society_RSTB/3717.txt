In the Gymnosperms the mode of development of the bordered pit and the presence
or absence of a limiting membrane in it were questions to which much attention was
given by anatomists in the last half of the past century. Sanzo (1873),f to whom we
owe the discovery of the “torus” in Pinus, and the final demonstration of the closed
pit in this form, a condition which he thought characterised the whole of the
Gymnosperms, has briefly summarised the work of previous investigators (pp. 92-96). His masterly demonstration and statement of the case have, no doubt, been
responsible for the fact that until recently all the Gymnosperms have been con-
sidered as conforming to this type. In 1907, however, GwyNNE-VAUGHAN, at the
Leicester meeting of the British Association, opened the controversy again by his
conclusion that there is no limiting membrane in the pitting of certain ferns. In
his published account (1908) he states his inability to discover a pit-closing membrane
either in the Cycad or the Araucarian material he had at his disposal.
