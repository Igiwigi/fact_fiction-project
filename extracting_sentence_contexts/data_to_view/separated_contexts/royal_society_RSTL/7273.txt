I think not; though this might very easily occur
a thin-walled vessel, such as I believe this structure to be. If they really are 8olid
aus bands, what can they be except either muscles or nerves? But putting aside the
S facie improbability of such an extraordinary and unsymmetrical arrangement of
Gola bands, such a view as to their nature 8eems absolutely negatived by the fact of
Ir undulating course, and their situation in the midst of a structure which would be dis-
bed and destroyed by their action. Then, again, with regard to the other view, which
2ms to find most favour with ScaxEIDER®, that these bands belong to the nervous system,
are met by the fact that, according to my measurements, they are often three times as
pad as the largest nerve-fibre I could find issving from a ganglion-cell in connexion
th the cegophageal ring. In addition to this there is the difficulty of their asymme-
eal distribution, which seems quite inexplicable on the supposition of their being
