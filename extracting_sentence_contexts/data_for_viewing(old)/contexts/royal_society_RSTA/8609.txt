296 MR. G, I. TAYLOR ON STABILITY OF A VISCOUS LIQUID

The fact that there are no terms containing z in these equations shows that the
normal modes of disturbance are simple harmonic with respect to z, the wave-length
being 27/4. o is a quantity which determines the rate of increase in a normal
disturbance. If o is positive the disturbance increases and the motion is unstable.
If o is negative the disturbance decreases and the motion is stable. If o is zero the
motion is neutral. It will be seen from the way in which o enters into the equations
that it cannot be imaginary or complex unless w,, ¥,, w,; are complex.

Bessel Functions used in the Solution.

The solution of equations (2.6), (2.7) and (2.8) is developed by means of a type of
Bessmu functions of order 1 which vanish at r= R, and r= R,. Let J, (xr) and
W, («,°) be two independent solutions of the BresseL equation,
