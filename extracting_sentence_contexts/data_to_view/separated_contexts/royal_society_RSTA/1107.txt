-The
dotted curves show the values given by the approximate solution. maximum shear is almost three times that given by the approximate solution. Part
of this discrepancy is accounted for by the fact that the approximate solution only
allows for a fraction of the shear across the diminished section. The whole shear across
the section « = 0 is given by

2 yb de
which is easily found to be é
HP (1 — 0°)? (4 — 492 — 804).
