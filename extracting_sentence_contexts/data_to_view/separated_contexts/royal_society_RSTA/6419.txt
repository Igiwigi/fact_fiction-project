There is no
Planck’s constant, h, either, which is responsible for the mathematics of QM in all of its aspects,
and which, as noted, reflects certain fundamental aspects of nature, assuming that QFT holds
all the way down to the Planck scale. In quantum physics, at least in RWR interpretations,
once one measures one complementary variable, say, the position, no expectations at all are
experimentally possible as concerns a future value of the other at any future point. In fact,
this is true even if one assumes classical causality, as in Bohmian mechanics. In other words,
when one is asked the second question, concerning the momentum, in any given sequences,
the information carried over from the preceding question, concerning the position, does not and,
in principle cannot, influence the response to this new question, or the future predictions from
this point on. According to Wang and Busemeyer: ‘When one is asked a subsequent question,
information carried over from the preceding question provides a context for the construction
of the second and influences the subsequent response’ [33] (p. 2).
