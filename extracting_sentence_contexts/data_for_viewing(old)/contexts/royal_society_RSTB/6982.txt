inserted on the median side of the dorsal condyle of the mandible. It has interesting
consequences. At the beginning of adduction the median surface of the mandible faces
antero-ventrally, and the median tooth lies anterior and dorsal to the subapical and apical
teeth. On adduction, then, it is the median tooth which comes first into contact with the
grain, being followed in turn by the subapical and apical teeth passing forwards and
inwards behind it. As already described (p. 250) the apical tooth is sharp and recurved, and
is, from its appearance, a more effective cutting agent than the teeth which precede it.
Since it cuts last, the food it detaches must to a large extent remain in the excavation
in the grain. On the next abduction of the mandibles this food will be little disturbed by
the rounded backs of the teeth passing through and over it. As the mandibles come to-
gether for the second time, however, the median tooth, being the first to encounter the
detached food, will tend to sweep it inwards and backwards into the pre-oral cavity. Such
a mechanism of food collection would account for the fact that the most effective cutting
tooth is the last to come into contact with the grain.

Food collection is probably further facilitated by the asymmetry of the mandibles.
Among Crustacea it has been shown (Cannon & Manton 1927) that this plays a large part
in food transference, and in Calandra also it is probable that food is passed in a zigzag
manner between the teeth of right and left mandibles until it reaches the molar teeth,
Furthermore, the asymmetry of the mandibles has the obvious result of allowing the
mandibles to come completely together on apposition.

The movements and functions of the right mandible are similar to those of the left,
with the exception that here the subapical tooth is the prominent cutting tooth.
