Bhecexcarily exist when the particles are prevented from following them to form a chemical
Zompound. Let us suppose the particles « and b 80 brought together that a chemical
Attraction is exerted between them ; and let us suppose a third body, c, brought into the
Sphere of attraction of the other two; this third body will then also exert an attraction
Dpon @ and 6. The attraction between @ and 6 will not remain the same as it originally
EM but it will be the resultant of all the forces originating in «a, 6 and ce. It is thus

ily seen, that the attractions, which tend either to effect or support a chemical combi-
ZSation between two bodies, must be altered in the sphere of action of a third body; and
at the presence of a third body may therefore, according to circumstances, effect or
-prevent the formation of a chemical compound. From this point of view the explana-
Fion of contact phenomena offers no difficulties. The point which has in general been
Fought to be the most inexplicable, is the fact that the smallest given quantity of one
Jubstance is able to combine or decompose the largest given quantity of another sub-
Stance, without thereby losing any of its decomposing or combining power; as if an
mount of effect could be produced without the expenditure of an equivalent amount of
Force, We need, however, only consider a little more closely the conditions under which
She phenomena of contact occur, in order to assure ourselves that these phenomena do
ot violate this first law of mechanics, but that they are merely common and simple
Effects of chemical affinity. If we suppose a number of chemically combined particles
Flaced in the neighbourhood of a contact-substance, the attraction of the foreign contact-
body is added to that which holds the chemically combined substances together, and the
resultant of all these forces may be such that a decomposition of the chemically com-
bined particles can ensne. When the decompoxition has been effected, and the contact-
s$ubstance is still swrrounded by the separated particles, all further action must cease. Tf,
