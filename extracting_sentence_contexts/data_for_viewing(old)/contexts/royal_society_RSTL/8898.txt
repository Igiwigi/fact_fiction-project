have been added to the water in which a vigorous medusid is contained, the locomotor
pulsations of the latter become slower and slower in the time occupied by their execu-
tion, while the intervals of diastole become more and more prolonged. Concurrently
with this slowing of the pulsations their strength naturally grows less and less vigorous,

normal interyal, and when they occur are of the feeblest character. Soon after this
stage has been reached the systoles altogether cease; and in a few seconds after they have
done 80 the animal fails to respond even to the strongest stimuli ; and this, be it remem-
bered, is quite as remarkable a fact in the case of Medus as it is in the case of the
higher animals. 'The time occupied by the whole of this process varies with different
species ; but it is always very brief, namely (speaking from memory) about fifteen seconds
to a minute in the case of Sarsia and eighty seconds to two minutes in that of Aurelia
aurita. But brief as is the time required for chloroform to assert its influence upon
Meduse, it is long as compared with the time required for its effects to pass off when
the animal is again restored to normal sea-water. A specimen of Sarsia which has been
completely anzsthesiated, and s0 to all appearance perfectly dead, resumes its pulsations
a few seconds after being again immersed in unpoisoned water. There appears to be a
relationship, however, between the time required for complete anzesthesiation and that
required for complete subsequent recovery, for the recovery of Aurelia aurita takes a few
8econds longer than does that of Sarsia. In all cases the recovery is progressive, the
first pulsations being very feeble and the periods of diastole prolonged ; but very shortly
