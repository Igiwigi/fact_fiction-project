ve scarcely even a speculative interest if the basis of the formula is not an

$65. Wrper's theory of the magnetisation of iron is incomplete, because it omits
to take account of retentiveness. MaxwerLLs extension of it, which ascribes
- retentiveness to something resembling the permanent set of an overstrained solid
fails, it appears to me, to explain the hysteresis which is found in all changes of
magnetism brought about by changes of the magnetising force. The idea of a
resistance to rotation of the molecules resembling the friction of solids, which has
© been suggested by several writers, suffices to explain hysteresis, and is 8upported by
other phenomena which I have already noticed in passing. It accords remarkably well
Swith the low values of « which we find in the early part of the magnetisation curye ;
Balzo with the effects which vibration has in increasing the susceptibility of iron to
=8mall forces and in destroying its retentiveness. In fact, for zoft iron it requires little
2 —_ to make it cover the facts. In hard iron and steel, on the other hand,
Sphers the residual magnetism is of a far stabler character, retentiveness seems partly
due to some 8uch action as MAXWELL has 8uggested, though effects resembling those
Fof friction are also present. Both notions—that of permanent set and that of
"frictional resistance—seem needful for anything like a full account of the phenomena,
Sand if we are to attempt to form a mechanical conception of the process on such lines
Ss these, we must assume : (1) An elastic tendency on the part of the molecules to
recover their primitive position when displaced ; (2) a static frictional resistance to
their displacement and to their return, removable by vibration ; (3) a limit for each,
Such thab if the displacement of the molecule exceeds it, a permanent displacement,
Snot removable by vibration, results ; (4) probably a viscous resistance to the displace-
mount and return of the molecules ; (5) an unequal distribution amongst the molecules
