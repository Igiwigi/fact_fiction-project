The anterior rami of the pterygoids are separated by an interpterygoid vacuity
of moderate size, the extreme anterior border of which is, in the two specimens
mentioned, formed by the prevomers.

The prevomers are fused, but they have otherwise all the relations of the
prevomers of Lycosaurus. They articulate with the palatal process of the pre-
maxilla, separating the anterior nares; posteriorly they articulate with the anterior
ends of the pterygoids and laterally with the palatines. In both types they clasp |
the lower edge and anterior end of a median bone, which in the Anomodont is
definitely known to be the parasphenoid ; the difference is that in the Therocephalian
the bone is exposed in the palate, whereas in the Anomodonts it lies slightly higher
in the skull, but it is not one of much importance. The only other difference, the
fact that in Lycosaurus the pterygoids meet in median suture in advance of the
interpterygoid vacuity, whilst they do not in Endothiodon, is simply due to the
extraordinarily short distance between the posterior nares and the basipterygoid
process in the latter type.

The epipterygoid in Anomodonts is a slender rod rising from the pterygoid
articulation to the parietal. Its lower end lies on the outer and upper surface of
the pterygoid, and sends a process backwards along the outer and upper side of the â€”
posterior ramus of the pterygoid; the length of this process is very variable in
different forms, in some it may very nearly reach the quadrate, The suture below
this part of the epipterygoid is that found by Prof. and Miss Souvas in their
Dicynodon skull (p, 219, loc. cit.).
