: p—q=P—-te—-g ond gor=r—gr—r.

Z Obviously, therefore, as a first approximation when }, p, are very advanced terms
in the hypothenuse,

Let us write

for a second approximation.

* Asa matter of fact, it will be found that, as soon as g and p attain the values 6, 24, g? — $ q' may
be taken as a superior limit. It may be noticed also, to prevent a wrong inference being drawn from the
above expressions, that, as will hereafter appear, 7 is an infinitesimal of the order 1/q*, when q is
infinite.
