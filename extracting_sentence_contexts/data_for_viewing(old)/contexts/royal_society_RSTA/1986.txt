that nothing was published about it. The blame was put at Challis and Airy for not giving ‘the
young and retired man the kind of help or advice that he should have received’ [2, p xxvi]. Writing
a few years after Airy’s death, Glaisher explicitly puts the blame on the Astronomer Royal for
not making sure that Adams’ work was published. Such opinions remained well over hundred
years in the literature about the discovery of Neptune (e.g. [15,16]), but recent studies are more
sympathetic to Airy (e.g. [18,55]) and Challis [12].

Was Adams an inexperienced youth who had a ‘difficulty, which all young writers feel more
or less, in putting into shape and order what he has done’ [56, p xxx]? Or did Adams act ‘like a
bashful boy rather than like a man who had made a great discovery’ [57, p xxvi]? This remains


entirely a matter of opinion. The facts are that Adams had made an astonishing prediction, but
failed to convince his peers that it was a serious theory. The moment Airy saw a confirmation of
Adams’ prediction, he acted and Challis started a serious observational campaign. His approach
was perhaps not very enthusiastic, but it was professional. He might have taken a sky chart made
by Argelander for the Berlin Academy in 1832 (distributed in 1833) which covered the region
where Neptune was at the end of July (at the beginning of his search), and would most likely have
seen it within a night, as it happened in Berlin.> His approach was different, however, attempting
to chart the stars himself in the most rigorous way, but also continuing to work on other projects
that interested him more (i.e. comets). In the end, it is important to state that Adams was not
drawn into any of the discussions and accusations around him. He never said a word against
Challis, or Airy or Le Verrier.
