+4Bv = 0 where 2B? = 2#e S10 A
ia

Taking into consideration the fact that v does not become infinite for infinite values
of z, the solution of this is
Pawnee sin bedaye- COB EZ, . «<2 se we (12)
Differentiating this twice with respect to z we find

dy
dz

Substituting this value in (11) we find

= 2B*(—A,e-™ cos Be+Ae™ sin Bz).
