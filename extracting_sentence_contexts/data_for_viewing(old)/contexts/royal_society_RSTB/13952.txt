ence with our approximation, because despite the relatively and plasmid costs [42]. Instead, the key insight that emerges

high level of expression of plasmid-borne genes [37,38], the from these studies is that plasmid costs are mainly caused by


genomic and metabolic conflicts arising between plasmid
and chromosomal genes [37,38,43-45].

It is possible that a reduction of the cellular translation
capability will lead to a decrease in plasmid-derived protein
levels, thereby relieving the cell from the burden caused by
their interaction with cellular networks, and reducing plas-
mid-associated costs. In addition, the fact that plasmids
generally show suboptimal codon usage preferences may
further reduce plasmid-derived protein levels, as translation
of plasmid proteins is likely to be slower than that of chromo-
somal proteins. This might mechanistically explain why we
(and others [29]) found positive epistasis between rpsL
mutations and plasmid carriage. In agreement with this
idea, plasmid costs are often reduced by mutations in global
regulators that lower plasmid gene expression [42]. Our results
might also help to explain the observation that plasmids tend
to produce smaller costs when cells are growing slowly, such
as in poor nutrient conditions [37]. During slow growth, avail-
