A different type of geometric alternative to general relativity with additional fields that appeared
very early in the 1960s was the Einstein-Cartan gravity theory, a mixture of the structures of
general relativity with another theory introduced by Elie Cartan [85] in 1924, and based on two
invariants of the Poincare group—the space-time curvature and torsion. In solid-state physics
torsion was used to describe dislocations in crystals, however, attempts to include torsion in
Einstein’s already well-studied and developed theory of gravity appeared only in the 1960s. The
first people who recalled torsion were, apparently, Kibble [86] and Sciama [87], in whose works
an original idea was voiced about the possible relationship of space-time torsion with the proper
angular momentum of matter.

But the theory began to develop only after the first (and sensational) torsion effect was
calculated. In the works of researchers of the Krakow school Kopezynski [88] and Trautman
[89], it was demonstrated that the torsion of space-time, which geometrically reflects the fact
of polarization of spin of the dust particles, the source of the gravitational field, can eliminate
cosmological singularities in Friedmann universes. The Einstein—Cartan theory has two essential
features: (i) the torsion field equations (obtained by varying the Lagrangian by affine connection)


are purely algebraic equalities linking torsion with its source, the spin of particles of gravitating
matter; this means that torsion does not extend in this theory. (ii) Since the same Lagrangian
(scalar curvature) with a single coupling constant (the Newton-Einstein gravitational constant) is
used to obtain the equations of the gravitational field and torsion, the spin-torsion interaction
turns out to be proportional to this constant and is therefore extremely weak. In addition,
the weakness of this interaction is repeatedly ‘aggravated’ by the Planck constant, which in
the classical version of the theory is linked with the spin value of the gravity source. Also
