In hydrogen it appears under the
lowest pressures at which that gas has been examined. It is probable, therefore, that
this resistance to change of volume occurs in all gases even at low pressures, although,
except in the case of hydrogen, it cannot be directly observed at low pressures, from the
internal attractive forces producing a much greater change in the opposite direction, In the play of these opposing internal actions we have the explanation of the singular
fact that the air-manometer indicates almost true pressures at 200 atmospheres, while
at lower pressures its indications are above, and at higher pressures below the truth*. It is commonly assumed that in hydrogen gas the molecular forces producing internal
attraction are absent ; but this conclusion is doubtful, as the effects observed are pro-
bably here also differential. In carbonic acid, on the other hand, the internal attractive
forces are yery powerful, and mask the effects due to resistance to pressure till the gas
is reduced to a small fraction of its volume under one atmosphere.
