feathers aside without disturbing the bird, it was found that the beak was placed
along the lateral apterium, with its base immediately cephalad of the axilla. As the
wing is so placed in the position of rest that the upper arm is directed from the axilla
upwards and backwards, the base of the beak lay in a kind of trough, bounded
mesiad by the trunk and laterad by the wing, the naked elbow being very obvious as
a small flesh-coloured projection just external to it. In this position the distal portion
of the wing is thrust somewhat outwards, and its feathers—remiges and upper coverts
—appear externally, taking a direction downwards and backwards over the ordinary
contour feathers of the trunk.

It is rather significant that this is precisely the attitude of a Goldfinch or Canary
when asleep, the beak in these cases being over (dorsad of) the axilla, and therefore, of
course, under the spreading side feathers. Perhaps the facts may be explained
by supposing that during the evolution of the genus Apteryz, the great lateral spaces
were retained as resting places for the increasing beak, although no longer useful for
the reception of the diminishing wings.

Another fact which appears to me to tell in favour of the derivation of Apteryx from
a progenitor with well developed wings, is the fact that the wing is provided with a
true alar membrane. Both Owen’s figure (24, Plate 1, fig. 4), which shows the wing
of A. australis from the outer side with most of the feathers removed, and BuLurr’s
(7, Plate 12, fig. 6), which shows that of A. bulleri from the inner side with the
feathers in sit@, are apparently taken from somewhat shrivelled specimens. The
wing of a perfectly fresh specimen of A. bulleri is shown in figs. 14 and 15 (Plate 8):
it has, precisely as in typical Carinatze, a distinct fold of skin, or pre-patagium, passing
