Indeed, Hilbert had met : S
Boltzmann several months earlier in Munich, where the latter gave a talk on recent developments 2
in physics. Boltzmann had not only discussed ideas connected with the task that Hilbert was now aed
calling for but also adopted a rhetoric that seems to have appealed very much to Hilbert. In fact, 22
Boltzmann had suggested that one could follow up the recent history of physics with a look at [4
future developments. Nevertheless, he said, ‘I will not be so rash as to lift the veil that conceals the : >
future’ [32, p. 79]. Hilbert, on the contrary, opened the lecture by asking precisely, ‘who among us : =
would not be glad to lift the veil behind which the future lies hidden’ and the whole trust of his i8

talk implied that he, the optimistic Hilbert, was helping the mathematical community to do so.
