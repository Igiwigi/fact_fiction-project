aspects of its interpretation while clarifying some potential misunderstandings.

(a) Interventionist versus probabilistic causation

Some interpretations (e.g. [31]) of the presented framework place emphasis on its relation to

a
the Granger notion of probabilistic causation, as the definition of causal emergence is based on =
predictive ability—as opposed to, for example, interventionist approaches to causality based on : a
counterfactuals, as proposed by Pearl & Mackenzie [32]. However, it is important to note that : 2
the framework presented here belongs to neither the Granger nor Pearl schools of thought, and : &
admits both kinds of causal interpretation depending on the underlying probability distribution : =
from which the relevant quantities are computed. As a matter of fact, all the quantities described [8
in §3 and [7] depend only on the joint probability distribution p(X», X;). If this distribution : =
is built using a conditional distribution p(Xy|X;) that is equivalent to a do() distribution in [8
Pearl’s sense [32], and the system satisfies a few other properties,> then the results of ID can : S

be interpreted in an interventionist causal sense. On the other hand, if the distribution is built
on purely observational data, then the decomposition obtained from ®ID generally should be
understood in the Granger-causal sense (i.e. as referring to predictive ability). In both cases, the
formalism developed here applies directly, and it is only the interpretation of the findings that
needs to be adapted.

It is also important to clarify that the reason why correlation between variables of a system
of interest often does not imply causation is because of hidden (i.e. unobserved) variables.
