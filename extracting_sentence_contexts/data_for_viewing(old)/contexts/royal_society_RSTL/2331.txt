(e.) When a second and precisely similar jar was connected with the former, s0 as
to double the extent of coating, similar quantities, measured as before, only exhibited
one fourth of the previous forces respectively.

With three similar jars, that is, with three times the surface, the force was only one
ninth part of the respective forces first obseryed.

By substituting the electrometer, fig. 2, in place of the balance, the march of the
attractive force may be gradually observed, 80 as to exhibit the above results by
minute degrees, thereby furnishing very interesting experiments.

21. The phyzical causes of these effects are not very apparent ; they seem, how-
ever, to have some connexion with the following fact. The force exerted between
two given suhstances, is more or less diminished by the presence of a neutral or other
body sharing in the attraction.

Thus, the excited balls of an electrometer tend to close when an uninsulated
neutral body is brought near them.

The attractive force evinced by any description of electrometer in connexion
with a charged conductor, will apparently diminish when a neutral body is presented
toward the conductor.

A similar phenomenon is observable when neutral bodies are interposed between
two conductors, mn, fig. 10; one, x, being permanently electrified, and influencing the
