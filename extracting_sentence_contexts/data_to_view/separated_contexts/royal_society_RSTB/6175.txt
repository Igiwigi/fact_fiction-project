_ It is likely, however,
from analogy with other species that this is the case, at least during the carly part
of the season. Some slight evidence in support of this view is provided by the fact
that sperms were present in the Fallopian tubes of S. 1066 which was obtained on
June 10 and which was evidently at the height of lactation, as judged by the develop-
