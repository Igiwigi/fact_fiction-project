continuity with the cartilage of the ala temporalis, by-the intermediary of the
processus pterygoideus of the latter. That this is no mere fortuitous relation is
shown by the fact that the continuity is present symmetrically on both sides in four
embryos varying in length between 8-7 and 11 mm., of which I have studied complete
serial sets of sections. It is interesting to compare these relations in Sorex with those
which TzRRy (1917, p. 322) has described in the cat. In that animal, the pterygoid
cartilage “ presents a short cylindrical, transversely placed pedicle. . . .” “The
pedicle consists of dense mesenchyma, continuous with the perichondrium of the margin
of the pterygoid process of the lamina ascendens ” of the ala temporalis.
