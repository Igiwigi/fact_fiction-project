RTRAND. We conclude from examination of sections, very clearly in the case
iBipteris, though with less clear demonstration in the more complex case of
H@n, that the synangium is a product of the adaxial surface of the sporangio-
and that it arises immediately below the organic apex of that part. These

f the synangium had proved to be terminal, there would be no need to have
