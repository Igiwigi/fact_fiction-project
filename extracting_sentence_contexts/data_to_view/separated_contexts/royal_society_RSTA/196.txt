In
experiments with a cylindrical condenser unit placed so as to project over the measuring
end of the bar, as described in § 4, the quantity measured is the longitudinal displacement
at the surface of the bar; in this case, the ratio of mean normal pressure to the longitudinal
velocity at the surface will only be equal to pcy in the limiting case where a/A is zero. Finally,

a cylindrical unit placed on the bar itself, as indicated in § 1, measures the radial displace-
ment at the cylindrical surface of the bar and in general the ratio of this displacement to
the mean normal pressure will not be equal to aalE.

To determine the errors introduced into the measurements by these effects, it is first
necessary to determine the radial displacement at the cylindrical surface of the bar and the
distribution of longitudinal stress and displacement over the cross-section of the bar for
various values of « and a/A, and then to find the mean values of the stress and displacement
over the cross-section of the bar. The necessary equations for these quantities are easily
obtained from the relationships given by Love (1934), and the expression for the longitudinal
displacement is in fact given by Bancroft (1941). The differences between our notation and that used by Love and by Bancroft are shown
in table 11-4. The remainder of the notation agrees with that used by Love and by Bancroft.
