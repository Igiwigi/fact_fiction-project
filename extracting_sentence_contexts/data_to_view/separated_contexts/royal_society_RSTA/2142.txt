(P = 3, 4,..., N — 1). The importance of these equations lies in the fact that in the case of steady motion
all the coefficients are constant. Since

we may state the following result :

TurorEM XXXII (K).—Jn order that the motion of a holonomic system may be stable
in the kinematical sense, it is necessary and sufficient that the values Of %0)5 2), «+45 Ry —1)
