rates, one above and one below the turning point, are then considered to be sufficient
to enable that point to be calculated. With viscous solutions, such as 660 grammes of cane sugar, it was necessary to
lengthen the interval of time considerably ; in fact, a constant rate was generally only
attained after the apparatus had been set up for some 5 or 6 hours. In the earlier experiments, before we realised that the method was susceptible of
greater accuracy, we used somewhat larger increments of pressure. It was found that
there were slight differences in the rate corresponding to a given pressure according
as that pressure had been reached from above or below.
