It will be seen that large changes in the amount of roughness produce only small
changes in the amount of friction on the bottom. On looking at Bazin’s formula
it will be seen that this is due to the fact that the sea is deep. In order that the
roughness of the bottom may. have a large effect in slowing down a stream, it is
necessary that 7 should be small. It seems, in fact, that the size of the projections
which constitute the roughness or inequality of the bed must be some definite fraction
of v in order that their effect may be felt on the stream as a whole.
