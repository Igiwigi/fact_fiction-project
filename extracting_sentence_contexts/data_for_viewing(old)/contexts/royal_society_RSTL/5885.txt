present investigation fully imbued with the opinion that these parts were blood-reser-
voirs and channels, and 1 only relinquished it when it became no longer tenable, Step
by step the points relied on had to be abandoned, until at length the full conviction was
arrived at, that T had been secking to establish a fallacy. I have been unable to dis-
cover any communication between the true blood-system and the psendo-vascular rami-
fications in the mantle, or the perivisceral chamber. Injections were thrown into this
chamber, but none of the fluid found its way into any part of the lacunary system. The
pallial lobes were removed, and the great, pallial sinuses distended to their fullest capa-
city, with exactly the same result; and it was not until great pressure was applied,
and the tissues ruptured, that a little of the injected matter was extravasated into the
peripheral lacunes. The perivisceral chamber, then, and all its various ramifications,
are in no way connected with the true blood-system. They must have some other
