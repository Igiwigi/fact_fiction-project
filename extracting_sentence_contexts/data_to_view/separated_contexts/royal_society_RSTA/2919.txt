In the CWT, the time and
scale parameters (a,b) are continuous. In many cases, the complex Morlet wavelet is preferred as the mother wavelet w(t) in (2.1),
given by Addison [3]:

WO= Te eee, (2.2)

where f, is a bandwidth parameter and f- is the wavelet centre frequency. In fact, the complex
Morlet wavelet is a Gaussian-windowed complex sinusoid; hence, its second-order exponential
decay results in optimal time localization during the wavelet transform. Additionally, the
complex Morlet wavelet function provides information about both amplitude and phase, and
it is better adapted for capturing coherence between harmonic frequencies [3].

(b) Third-order spectrum (TOS): bispectrum (BS)
The BS Bx(w1, 2) of a process {x(k)} is defined as [2]
By(w1, @2) = E{X(@1)X(w2)X*(1 + @2)}, (2.3)

where E is the expectation value, X(w;), i= 1,2, is the complex Fourier coefficient of the process
{x(k)} at frequencies w; and X*(wj) is its complex conjugate.

(c) Third-order coherence (TOC): bicoherence (BC)

The bicoherence (BC) bx(#1, 2) of a process {x(k)} is defined as the normalized BS [2], i.e. Bx(w1, @2)
[Ps(o1)Px(co2)Pr(o + 2) }"/2"

where P(w;), i= 1,2, is the power spectrum of the process {x(k)} at frequencies «j.

bx(@1, @2) = (2.4)

(d) Wavelet bispectrum (WBS)

WBS combines CWT with bispectral analysis and, in an analogy to the definition of the BS in
Fourier terms (see (2.3)) of a signal x(t) € L?(R), it could be defined as [5]

WBx(a1, 42) = I, W*(a,t)Wx(a1, T)Wx(az, 7) dt, (2.5)


where the integration is performed over a finite time interval T: 1 <1 < 1%, and a,a),a2 satisfy
the following rule:
tii + 4 (2.6)
a am ay
WBS actually expresses the amount of QPC in the interval T, which occurs between wavelet
components of scale lengths a), az and a of x(t), such that the sum rule of (2.6) is satisfied.
