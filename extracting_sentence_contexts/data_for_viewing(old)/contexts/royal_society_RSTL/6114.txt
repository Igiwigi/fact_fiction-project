S Along the bases of the crumples the fil- mmm 4
lets of water which poured down their faces
Swvere collected and flowed. The streams thus formed ran in many cases alongside the
= existing veins of white ice, and had worn for themselves deep channels in the glacier.
5 The thought s0on suggested itself, that the seams themselyes were formed by the gorging
up of those channels by snow in winter, and the subsequent consolidation of this snow

during the descent of the glacier. Indeed the channels of the streams seemed the exact
matrices of the scams of white ice *.

* The fact of one branch of a vein running up the face of a crumple, seems to prove that the ice, which
at one time constitutes the base of a crumple, does not always remain 80; the bases 'of the crumples are
5ometimes 7ifted wp by the 8queezing. The horizontal structure at the fronts of many of the crumples
seems due to a local foreing forward of one protuberance over that next below it. Were the matter tested
by 8triet measurement, I think it would be found that different portions of the erumples moye downwards
with different velocities. According to this view, upon the general motion of the glacier there are /oca/
motions 8uperposed.
