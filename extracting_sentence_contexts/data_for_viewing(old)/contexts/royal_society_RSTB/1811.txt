that greatest fecundity is not equal to greatest health of the children. As for this
latter point I had occasion to make observations on the influence of the parental age

natality the following figures for the couples between the quoted limits of age and for
the children born in those families in four years :—

Father 24-25 and mother 18, 19, or 20 . . . . . 87 families with 148 births,

or yearly 189 births, giving a natality of 45°7 per cent.

Looking at the table of natality (rough figurest), we shall see that there are only
