In my own
preparations, where the fibres are coloured intensely, it is possible to trace processes of
cells of Type IL for a considerable distance through the fibre-tracts into other enteric
ganglia, There they terminate in relation to other neurones in the diffuse endings in
question. Moreover, the endings of processes of the cells of Type I on cells of Type II
are so clearly visible in silver preparations that it is impossible to accept JoHNsoN’s
view as to the non-existence of synapses between the local neurones. CARPENTER’S
suggestion that these diffuse endings might be derived from the sympathetic or splanchnic
fibres has never been confirmed, and the facts put forward earlier in this paper (ante p. 370)
show that these fibres have no connection whatever with the enteric neurones. The view that the enteric nervous system is composed, at least in part, of a syncytial
nerve-net is held by a number of investigators. Brrut (5) and R.
