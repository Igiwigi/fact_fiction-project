Fe symmetrically arranged with respect to the dorso-ventral axis.
'Z Besides the large sexual polyps there are other forms known as the rudimentary
#ddividuals, or in K6L1IKER's terminology, as the zooids. These are microscopic in size,
_ no tentacles, no mesenterial filaments, no reproductive organs, and commonly
-znly two calyx-teethâ€”those, namely, on the ventro-lateral chambers. The zooids
Bossess, in fact, only septa, mouth, and cesophagus, the latter being richly ciliated
Yithin. Two distinet forms of zooids exist. One of these is represented by a single
arge zooid, placed near the middle of the disc on the dorsal side, and provided with
Ho full number of calyx-teeth.
