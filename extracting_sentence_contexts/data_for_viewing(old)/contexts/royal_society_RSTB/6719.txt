R. ROBINSON ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF ANTHOCYANINS 151

example, malvin together with some petunin and delphin, or peonin containing traces
of cyanin (cf. Table 1). Where mixtures of malvidin (3' : 5’-dimethoxydelphinidin),
petunidin and delphinidin glycosides are encountered, and particularly when the
proportions of the components may vary—as in Lathyrus odoratus—the malvidin and
petunidin are evidently formed by a straightforward process of methylation, not
necessarily of delphinidin itself, but perhaps of some intermediate, which in the
absence of methylating agents would give rise to delphinidin. In other words, the
essential steps in the syntheses of these three substances are the same, the difference
lying in the fact that the complete syntheses of petunidin and malvidin require one
stage more than that of delphinidin, namely, the methylating process.

It has been pointed out (Scott-Moncrieff 1936) that the presence or absence of
certain structural characteristics of the anthocyanin molecule, and certainly the sugar
types, is dependent upon the presence or absence of specific genes. Although there
is no proof as yet that the presence or absence of O-methyl groups is controlled in
this way, such an assumption is by analogy perfectly logical, If the reactions resulting
in the methylation of one or more hydroxyl groups are determined by specific factors,
then in the cases cited these genes cannot exert sufficient influence to enable the
reactions to be carried to completion. This appears self-evident, but it has been
emphasized in order to provide a parallel for cases of mixtures derived from different
anthocyanidins, since it is known that the transition from one anthocyanidin to
