or as wedges for splitting wood. I know of no analogous form among the Celtic imple-
ments; 80me of the rudely chipped arrow-heads found in Ireland and elsewhere present
the nearest approach to it, but are far smaller in size,"the weapons from the drift being
uxually from 5 to 6 inches in length. The ordinary form of stone celt is, as you are
aware, intended for cutting at its broad end, the narrow end being inserted in the socket
of the handle; these, on the contrary, cut or pierce at the narrow end, while the broad
end appears intended to rest against a stop or bracket, or to be held in the hand.

The third class, implements with a cutting edge all round, have also no correspond-
ence with the usual forms. Their prevailing shape is an oval, more or less pointed at
one end, and equally convex on both sides. They vary in length from 2 to 8 inches, but
are usnally from 4 to 6 inches long. There is also considerable variety in their form,
probably owing to defects in the flints from which they were fashioned ; and in fact the
two classes into which, for convenience sake, I have divided these rudely-formed instru-
ments, as distinct from the flint flakes, may be said to run one into the other; it being
hard to determine to which of them some of the weapons are to be referred. Such of
the Celtic implements as have a cutting edge all round, are more triangular in their form
and are of yery rare occurrence; those of the oyal-shape, on the contrary, appear to be
equally common in the drift with those of the spear head character, the oval form pre-
dominating near Abbeville, and the spear heads being most abundant at St. Acheul.
The use for which they were intended is by no means apparent. They may, however,
have been used as axes, or those of the smaller size possibly as sling-stones propelled
either from the ordinary sling or the end of a cleft stick.
