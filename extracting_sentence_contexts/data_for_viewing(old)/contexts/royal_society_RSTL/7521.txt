[Pinal Equilibrium of Temperature. ]
[The left-hand side of equation (147), as sent to the Royal Society, contained a term
2(8â€”1)* 2 the result of which was to indicate that a column of air, when left to

itself, would asume a temperature varying with the height, and greater aboye than
below. The mistake arose from an error* in equation (143). Equation (147), as now
corrected, shows that the flow of heat depends on the variation of temperature only, and
not on the direction of the variation of pressure. A vertical column would therefore,
when in thermal equilibrium, have the same temperature throughout.

When I first attempted this investigation I overlooked the fact that = is not the same
as #.2, and 80 obtained as a result that the temperature diminishes as the height increases
at a greater rate than it does by expansion when air is carried up in mass. This leads
at once to a condition of instability, which is inconsistent with the second law of thermo-
dynamics. I wrote to Professor Sir W., Tnoxs0x about this result, and the difficulty I
had met with, but presently discovered one of my mistakes, and arrived at the.conclu-
sion that the temperature would increase with the height. This does not lead to mecha-

* The last term on the left-hand side was not multiplied by 8.
