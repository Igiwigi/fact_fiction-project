where, when the force is parallel to the flux, and k: is scalar, it is the electric conduc-
tivity. Its magnetic analogue is gy, the magnetic conductivity. That is, a magnetic
onductor is a (fictitious) body which cannot support magnetic force without con-
‘inuously dissipating energy.

Er their volume densities. The quantity o is probably quite fictitious, like K.

% According to MaxweEtt’s doctrine, the true electric current is always circuital, and
as the sum of the conduction current and the current of displacement, which is the
‘Sime rate of increase of the displacement. But, to preserve circuitality, we must add
Bhe convection current when electrification is moving, so that the true current
