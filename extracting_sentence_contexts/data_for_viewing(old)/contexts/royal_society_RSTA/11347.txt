It will be apparent from the table that the relations of the linear expansions at 0°
still hold good, as the temperature is raised, in the cases of the potassium and cesium
salts. A similar observation has been shown to be valid with respect to the optical
properties. But in the case of the rubidium salt a remarkable change occurs. Owing
to the greater increment of the expansion along the direction of the axis c, the pre-
ponderance of the expansion along the axis a diminishes, until at 50° the amounts of
expansion along these two axial directions become equal. That is to say, in the
neighbourhood of 50° the crystals of rubidium sulphate simulate uniaxial symmetry
as regards their thermal behaviour. This is.rendered the more interesting by the fact
that. about this temperature the crystals of this salt also exhibit uniaxial optical
propérties:. OWwiiig to the extrémely feeble double ‘péfractiony it* was’ sliown (Joe. cit,

* axial directions, brought about by rise of temperature according to a rule common to
all three salts, result in bringing two of the refractive indices to equality about the
temperature indicated, and the optic axial angle diminishes until about the same
temperature the circular rings and rectangular cross of an uniaxial crystal are
exhibited in convergent polarised light. The exact temperatures at which the
