Moreover, no other animal was
obtained with more than one recent set of corpora lutea. The second alternative is
supported by the histological differences in the corpora lutea, but these might
possibly have been caused by the overcrowding resulting from the presence of so
large a number in the ovaries. The fact that no other animal was obtained with
more than 12 corpora lutea in a set supports this alternative. The second alternative
postulates that the first ovulation, which may or may not have been preceded by
copulation, did not result in pregnancy and was followed by a second which did ;
the interval between the two being sufficiently short to allow of the persistence of the
first set of corpora lutea and one of the ova. It is impossible on the evidence to
decide which hypothesis is true, but in either case the animal is so exceptional that
it is probable that it was functionally abnormal.
