same manner as light.

Professor PrevosT, of Geneva, seems to have been the first
person who endeavoured to establish this property of radiant
heat, which was afterwards more fully investigated by M.
DELaRocns ;* but though the truth of the experiments have
in general been admitted, the conclusions which these inge-
nious philosophers naturally drew from their experiments,
have lately been called in question by several eminent expe-
rimentalists in Great Britain. It seems, therefore, that new
experiments and observations are still wanting to place the
fact beyond the power of controversy : the following appear
to me quite sufficient for this purpose.

Let a large glass globe be blown so thin as to be almost
iridescent. Fix a small portion of this globe opposite a
circular hole about an inch in diameter, made in a sheet of
