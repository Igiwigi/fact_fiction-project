the wind two minutes after taking him out of the bath. To
my surprise, although the attendants were rubbing him dry
with towels during this time, the mercury. fell rapidly. He

was put into a warm bed, and his heat, when examined under
MDCCXC11. Ee


the tongue, was 877, at the axilla 89*. Frictions were used,
and brandy mixed with water administered ; but I found on
this, as on all future occasions, that the best mode of counter-
acting the cold, was to apply a bladder, with hot water, to the.
pit of the stomach (the scrobiculus cordis), a fact which I
think important : this being done, his shiverings, which be-
fore were severe, s00n ceased, and he became more comfort=-
able. Three hours afterwards, however, he had not entirely
recovered his former heat ; but by eight at night, he was in
all respects as usual.

I have been very minute in detailing the circumstances un-
der which this experiment was made ; some of the particulars
which, at the time, I thought of little consequence, I found
afterwards of importance. The experiment itself I determined
to repeat as exactly as possible.
