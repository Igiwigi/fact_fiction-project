9, and lastly, that as carbon, sulphur, and phosphorus, pro-
duce, by their union with iron, many chemical effects of much
sIimularity, so do each of them, when combined with that metal
in certain proportions, not only permit it to receive, but also
give it the peculiar power of retaining, the magnetical properties;
and thus, henceforth, in addition to that carburet of iron called
steel, certain sulphurets 'and phosphurets of iron' may be
regarded as bodies peculiarly susceptible of strong magnetical
impregnation.

Having thus, for the greater perspicuity, reduced the principal
facts of this Paper into a concise order, I shall now make some
general observations.

It is undoubtedly not a little singular, that a substance like
the magnetical pyrites, which, although not common, has been
long known to mineralogists, should not hitherto have been
chemically examined, especially as mineralogical authors have
mentioned the analysis of it as a desideratum, The result of
this which I have attempted, proves that it is really deserving
of notice; for. thus we have ascertained, that the sul phuret of
