2. Hemispherical Outgrowths.â€”By far the greater number of outgrowths belong
to this type, which has accordingly been already described by various authors in a
considerable number of species. Some new facts have, however, been observed in the course of the present
investigations. Intumescences of this type consist of both epidermal and mesophyll
cells, and are of two kinds, each kind having a different pathological effect upon the
plant which bears it. In the one kind (a) the cells of the outgrowth, both the
mesophyll cells and those of the epidermis, are in uninterrupted connection, and no
rupture of the tissues occurs.
