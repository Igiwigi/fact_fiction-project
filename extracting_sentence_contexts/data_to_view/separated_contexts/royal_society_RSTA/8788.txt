IN THE SPECTRUM OF MANGANESE. 181

(a)—The Ordinary Triplet System and Combination Lines. In the are spectrum of manganese Kayser and Runce* found five triplets with
separations about 173 and 129, and arranged them in two series, one sharp and one
diffuse. The formule given by these observers were

vy = 41223-86 —125229n-* —1377549n-'; (Diffuse series)
Ay, = 172-07; Avy = 129-14;

v = 41222-15 —119890n-* —580770n-*; (Sharp series)
Ay, = 173-78; Avo = 129°14;

An attempt has been made to extend these series, but a considerable difficulty arose
from the fact that the manganese spectrum is very rich in lines and that such expected
triplets would probably be very faint. Additional triplets, however, have been
recognised, as shown in Table I. Sharp series, 1\p—ms.—The first two triplets of this series were traced by Kayser
and Runer.
