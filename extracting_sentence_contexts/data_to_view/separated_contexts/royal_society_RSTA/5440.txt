+ (24). 83. Before discussing these equations in detail, it will be shown how in the theory
of reversibility certain very important restrictions must be imposed on the generality
of @ as a function of 6, V, and H, in order that known experimental facts shall not be
contradicted. These restrictions seem, for the most part, to depend on the particular
form of theory adopted in this paper; but as the particular features of the theory
which are thus involved are held by many physicists, it is of interest to notice exactly
what part of our fundamental assumptions causes the restrictions. The direct cause
of the trouble is the equation B = 47gV/.
