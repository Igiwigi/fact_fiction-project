When the veins of the central parts of the head, pharynx and body-wall of Lophius
are compared with the veins of the same regions in the Loricati, or Lopholatilus, it is
at once apparent that the mode of entry of the vein connected with the thyroid lymph
sinus into the heart is similar to that characteristic of the inferior jugular in those fishes. The vein is unpaired, but so is the inferior jugular of Lopholatilus. The fact that it
may open into either the right or left duct of Cuvier suggests that it is the survivor of
an original pair of stems similar to those that in the Loricati connect an unpaired
anterior segment of the vessel with the duct of Cuvier of either side. This assumption
is strengthened by the marked asymmetry shown by these two stems of the inferior
jugular in the Loricati. It is true that the factors that normally compose the inferior jugulars are absent
from this vessel in Lophius, and form tributaries of two other large veins (fig. 2, s.cl.v.)
that lie on either side of the pericardium upon the floor of the pharynx.
