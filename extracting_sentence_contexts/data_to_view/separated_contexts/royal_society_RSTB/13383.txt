Given the
relationship of metabolic rate and fj; through Fickâ€™s principle
[43], differences in fj; are expected to estimate differences in
metabolic rate when accounting for M, [44-46]. Although
this relationship may be more complicated in breath-holding
marine mammals [46-48], a lower rate of mass-specific
oxygen consumption coupled with an isometric relationship
between M, and body oxygen stores suggests that larger ani-
mals should have increased diving capacity [49-51]. In fact,
many studies in marine mammals have shown that M,

does positively correlate with dive duration, but M, alone
does not explain all of the observed inter-species variation
in diving patterns nor the variation across taxa [50,52-54]. In cetaceans, other ecological and physiological factors have
been suggested to play a role in determining diving behav-
iour including diel patterns [55], foraging ecology [56,57]
and the biochemical structure of respiratory pigments [58,59]. Given the potential importance of RSA in contributing to
efficient cardiorespiratory patterns of cetaceans, we aimed to
investigate the scaling of RSA and f;; across cetacean species
to examine inter-species variation in the degree of RSA.
