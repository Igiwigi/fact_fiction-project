OF THE MAMMALIAN EYE, ETC. 47

region in which only capillaries and fine vessels occur, and this region again is strictly
limited by the outer molecular layer, beyond which no vessels or capillaries can be
seen. In other words, the inner molecular layer is a barrier to the larger vessels ;
the outer molecular layer a barrier to capillaries, the latter being found between the
two molecular layers. Beyond the outer molecular layer the retinal vascularisation
ceases, and evidently these external parts depend for nourishment upon osmotic action
from the choroid through the membrane of Brucn.

The fact pointed out by LANGENBACHER that the retinal vessels of the Rabbit lie
internal to the Membrana limitans .interna, as in the Amphibia, holds good for all the
Leporidze, and causes the vessels to appear to the ophthalmoscope as raised ridges,
which cast a distinct shadow. As far as my observations have gone, the Chevrotain is
the only animal outside this family which has these retinal vessels similarly raised.

We have now to consider the question, in connection with the contents of the next
chapter (IIT.), whether there are any traces left in the Mammalia which are indicative
of a pre-mammalian stage of retinal supply, besides that of the embryonic occurrence
of the superficial and the central hyaloid vessels. It is well known that in the human
eye, in contradistinction to any other part of the body, the several branches of the
retinal arteries do not anastomose with each other (and the same holds good with
regard to the veins), excepting a few minute branches near the periphery. In a few
