known. In March 1867 and April 1865 the mean amonnt of moisture was found to be
2:82 grains per cubic foot ; im August and September 1865 it was 4:65 grains. In March
and April 1866 the moisture was 2-8 grains, and in August and September 4-21 grains.
This gives a relation of 1 to 1-65 for spring and autumn moisture 1865, and 1 to 1:50

for the same in 1866. Another important factor as influencing the transparency must
not be overlooked, viz. the presence of finely divided solid particles which floating about
produce the phenomenon. of atmospheric opalescence. 'This, taken in connexion with
the well known fact of the greater velocity of the winds in spring than in autumn,
thus increasing the quantity of these floating particles in the spring, points to an
explanation of the high autumnal and low yernal chemical intensity.

&X Our knowledge concerning the distribution of the chemically active rays on the earth's
Eurface is as yet very limited, and any conclusions with respect to the intensity of the
emical rays in the tropics have been, up to the present time, based upon the vague and
satisfactory statements of photographers. According to photographic observations it
Fould appear that in advancing from England towards the equator the difficulty of
taining good pictures is increased, and more time is said to be required to produce
