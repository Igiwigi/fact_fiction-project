unnecessary to do $0 here, because we have in fact already proved it in showing that
the elimination of a,, ... @,, b,, ... b,, from the system of equations (II.), (III.), leads
to the differential equations (I.) (se art. 6.). The n equations (IIT.) give therefore
the remaining » integrals of the system (I.), of which (II.) and (IIL.) together are the
complete solution.

The system of equations (IT.), (III.) being the same as that discussed in the pre-
ceding articles, all the conclusions there obtained will continue to subsist.
