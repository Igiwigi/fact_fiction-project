“nucleus” lies clearly within its gelatinous investment—the mechanism of retraeti
has failed partially, either because of unusual lack of vigour, or because of excessi;
resistance in the substance which is to be moved.

Any specimen of Carchesium, in which this double clustering of ingested matter
demonstrable, can, as I have said, be induced to perform the single movement
suitable change of food; it would seem, then, that we are dealing rather
inconstant stimuli than with inconstant response of cell substance. And the whe
variation is valuable, mainly, I think, because the slower changes which chara ‘
it are of help in the attempt to analyse the quicker, usual movement.

The somewhat detailed description which I have given of this phenomenon
aggregation may tend to obscure the fact that it is, in Carchesiwm, but one phase i
the sequence of digestive change ; that all the important transformations immediatel
bound up with solution of food are yet to follow. It ends the period of quiescence
during which most ingesta tarry within the basal curve of the nucleus; and
precedes a second mimic peristaltic movement, which, since the ingesta pass one
more towards the peristome (though on the side of the polype opposite to that
which they entered), may perhaps be distinguished as the movement of retrogressioi
(fig. 2, B, a,b). This is slower than the initial progression from the cesophagu
and is usually characterized by the slight continued shrinking of the ingesta on th
one hand, and, on the other, by the enlargement of the vacuoles which surroun!
them. These changes are indicated in fig. 2, a, B, fig. 7, b, b, and, though they va
under changed conditions, may be said to accompany the transit of all particle
whether they are relatively large or minute, insoluble or nutritious. But whe
