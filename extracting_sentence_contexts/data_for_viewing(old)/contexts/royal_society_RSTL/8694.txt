viz, this equation determines g as a function, in general a discontinuous function, of
(z. . . 2, w) such that the corresponding integral
is gdr...d:du
=: (a—a)?... +(e=2)*+ (e—w)2}4*7
may be the given function of the coordinates (@ . . . c, e). The equation is, in fact, the
distribution-theorem D. c

28, It is to be observed that the given function of (@ . . . c, e) must satisfy certain
conditions as to value at infinity and continuity, but it is not (as in the distribution-
theorems A, B, and C it is) required to satisfy a partial differential equation ; the
function, except as regards the conditions as to value at infinity and continuity, is abs0-
lutely arbitrary.

The potential (assuming that the matter which gives rise to it lies wholly within a
finite closed surface) must vanish for points at an infinite distance, or more accurately
it must for indefinitely large values of a*. . . +*+@ be of the form, Constant + by
