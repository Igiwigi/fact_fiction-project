At the levels of the interfilamentar junctions, and extending for a little distance
above and below them, trabeculwe may stretch across from the anterior to the posterior
side of the plica (e.g., Lyonsia norvegica), or where subfilamentar tissue is more
abundant, a complete horizontal septum may extend across the plical cavity (eÂ¢.,
Anatina flexuosa, Thracia corbuloides, and Entodesma saxicola).

The one or two filaments at the apex of the plica are larger than usual in Cham-
ostrea albida (Hancock, 29), Pandora inequicalva and Anatina flexuosa (not in
Anatina truncata). As already noted by Petsenrer (71, p. 212), the apical
filaments of Lyonsia norvegica are slightly differentiated. The frontal surfaces of
such enlarged filaments are more convex than usual, semi-cylindrical in fact. An
intrafilamentar septum is not uncommonly seen in the ordinary filaments of Lyonsia
nitida.

In the upper demibranch the plicee are smaller, and contain some three-fourths of
the number of filaments composing the plicee of the lower demibranch. The frontal
surface of the principal filament is usually quite flat. The plates of the upper demi-
branch which, in the presence of a reflected lamella, would be interlamellar septa, are
usually present on alternate principal filaments only. Their mesial edges end freely,
so that the upper demibranch is attached to the visceral mass by its edge only. In

Thracia corbuloides the principal filaments have no septa, and are free from the
visceral mass except at their upper ends. In Periploina sp. the interlamellar septa
