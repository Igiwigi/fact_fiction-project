The diagram (Plate 4) will make the arrangement clear. A deflexion of one
millimetre division is in angular measure 38°6”, and since each millimetre division of
the scale covered about 8 micrometer scale divisions, each divisible into 5 parts, we
may consider that the smallest deflexion which could be read with certainty was say
one-fortieth of this, or 0°96”. Since the magnification depended on the adjustments,
it varied slightly from day to day, but the general magnification was, as we say,
such that the distance between two consecutive scale images covered from 8 to 9
micrometer scale divisions. We ought to add that the definition of the mirror was a
good deal better than we have ever seen before in a mirror of about the same weight
and dimensions. It was worked for us by Mr. Coox, together with a large number
of similar mirrors, all about equally good. The best unworked glass we have tried
was incomparably worse. The difficulty in making such thin mirrors out of glass
arises from the fact that they always change their shape when they come off the
polishing tool; but in our experience the change of shape is very regular, thus a flat
mirror almost always becomes concave or convex; but it does not do so irregularly,
and consequently the definition remains satisfactory. The glass, of course, is ground
and polished on both sides. The window through which the light passes to and from
the mirror, is a strip of patent plate-glass, selected by the method of observing the
reflected images from the front and back, and cutting the glass so that it forms a
prism of small angle along the top or bottom edge. Patent plate-glass can be got
with fairly flat surfaces, which are, however, generally more or less inclined, and so in
cases of this kind the glass must be cut in such a way that the inclination of the
surfaces does not disturb the accuracy of the observations. For this method of
selecting glass, we are indebted to Professor Wricut, of Yale.
