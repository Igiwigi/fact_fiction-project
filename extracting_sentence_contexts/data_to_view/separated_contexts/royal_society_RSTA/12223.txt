But the use in the text of language appropriate to linear functions,
which arose from the notation, &e., being the same as before, is unjustifiable. We may, however, remove
this misuse of language, and make the equation (226), showing the flux of energy, rest entirely upon
the two cireuital equations. In fact, if we substitute in (226) the relations (217a), (217b), it becomes
merely a particular way of writing (214). It is, therefore, to (217a), (217b) that we should look for limitations. As regards (217a), there does
not seem to be any limitation necessary.
