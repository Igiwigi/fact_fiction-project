west winds militates against the idea that any considerable portion of their air-mass
can be drawn from the sea. Neither is it derived to any considerable extent from the
valleys and lower slopes of the surrounding hills. There is no permanent drainage of
air from these hill-slopes, and strong winds blowing outwards from the larger valleys,
like the dadu of Hurdwar, are local and exceptional phenomena, restricted to certain
hours of the day. At all the hill-stations of the outer North-West Himalaya, as far as
‘the existing registers show, southerly winds preponderate over northerly all through
the year ; and, although this is probably due in some measure to the fact that the night
winds have not hitherto been registered, it suffices to show that, up to a level of 7000
feet, there is no steady outflow of air from the hills to the plains.
‘There remains then only the supposition that these winds are fed by the descent
of air from an upper stratum, viz., from a current moving at a considerable elevation
from west toeast. And that this is their true explanation several facts seem to testify.
In the first place, they are characteristically winds of the day time, thei» movement
being at a minimum (almost or quite a calm) in the morning hours, and indeed up to
9 or 10 o'clock in the forenoon—then increasing with temperature, and falling again
towards evening ; and, secondly, such observations as have been made on the decrease
of temperature with elevation show that, in the dry weather, the vertical decrement
is such as is incompatible with the vertical equilibrium of an air column, being con-
siderably more than 1° in 183 feet. The diurnal variation of the movement is then
probably to be accounted for on Képrxn’s hypothesis, viz., the interchange of the
higher and lower air strata, by convective movements which do not affect the existing
horizontal movement of the higher atmosphere, so that the air of the latter, after its
descent, preserves for a time its original eastward motion. The hypothesis of con-
vective interchange receives further support from the’ character of the diurna
