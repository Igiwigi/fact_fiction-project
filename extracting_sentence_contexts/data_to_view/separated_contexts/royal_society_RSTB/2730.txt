So much so indeed, that the inibition is quickly and easily masked by the direct
effect of the venom on the heart, the latter action is manifested more slowly. It is
probable that inhibition of the heart is responsible for the early fall in blood
pressure, which is sometimes noticed before the plethysmographic lever has recorded
any change in intestinal volume. The slight extent of the inhibition, even when it
is observed, may be judged from the fact that it is only the auricle which shows the
change, the ventricle curve not being perceptibly affected in our tracings. Moreover
slowing of the heart was never well marked and was often absent.

(3) The direct action of the venom on the arterial muscle, or on its nerve-end
mechanism is, as we have shown above, such as to produce vaso-motor constriction. This effect can be clearly got with solutions of 1 : 250,000 and below, but we failed
to get it at 1: 500,000, It is therefore much weaker than the corresponding action of
Cobra venom, which can be demonstrated in a solution of 1 : 10,000,000,

(4) The injection of Krait venom is followed by a very early and decided fall of
blood pressure.
