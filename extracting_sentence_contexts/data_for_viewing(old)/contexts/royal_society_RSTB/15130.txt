Figure 4. Probability density plots of intensive agriculture and scatter plots for EA societies (a,b) and African societies (c,d). (a) The probability density for intensive
agriculture (Al 5 and 6 combined) for all EA societies. B1 and B2 rainfall values are marked with straight lines. (b) The values of B1 and B2 are marked on a
