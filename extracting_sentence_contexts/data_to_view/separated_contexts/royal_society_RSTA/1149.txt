and since the material does not change in density during the
extension from [y to 1, 7,, = t9 (1 + é)~!, where 7,» is the mean radius of the tube

Cre = @, Cy = — te —f, €,,=—te+f }
before the first stretching. Hence

by = 8, 6 .=0, €, =0
The extension
8 = Tino Io? (1 + e)~*x.

e = 31/l = 81/lp (1 + &).

(5) As has already been pointed out if the density and internal volume of the tube do not
change ¢,, = e., = — de so that the strain f in (4) is proportional to the change in
internal volume, in fact

change in internal volume 2 change in radius et change in length

internal volume of tube mean radius length
The strain quadric is Sy heal cine: ule Gll is
ex* — (te +f) y* — (ke —f) # + say =constant. ...... (7)
To find the direction of its principal axes put
r=2cos¢—y'sin¢d, y=a'sind+ycosd. ..... (8)

The strain quadrie then becomes
x” {e cos* 6 — (se +f) sin?
