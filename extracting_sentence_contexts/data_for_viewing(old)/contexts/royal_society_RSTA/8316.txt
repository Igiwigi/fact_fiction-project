imply the existence of I,,,,.

The (s — u)-dimensional elements I,_,,, of Tu, may be seen to be the uth
vertex figures of those s-dimensional elements of II,, which occur at one II,_,. Expressing
this fact numerically (the properties of II,,, being distinguished from those of I,
by changing “ p” into “ p, w’’), we have

This is a special case of the still more obvious relation

in which we may. as usual, replace m by n (= m).
Substituting 2.61 in 1.41, with r= u«W— 1, we have
