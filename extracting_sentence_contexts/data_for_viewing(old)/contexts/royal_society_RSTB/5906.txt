six depths at which the six nets were fishing. The fishing depth was maintained as
uniform as possible by keeping the angle of the warp nearly constant against a weighted
protractor ; the depths were obtained from the tracing on the Admiralty recorder,
attached to the warp, as described by Russett. Since the nets were fishing in the open
and quite clear of the shadow of the ship, the illuminations shown in Table I were obtained
by plotting the percentages at various depths, taking the readings in the “ a” position
as 100 and finding the appropriate values for the depths of the nets; such percentage
values were then multiplied by the quite unshaded “7” readings. In Table I the
metre candle has been used to express submarine illumination, since absolute, not
comparative values are required. Owing, however, to the alteration in the quality of
the light, this is no longer strictly accurate ; but as green light, to which the eye is most
sensitive, penetrates well, the error is probably not very great, but its presence should be
borne in mind—also the fact that while the colour sensitivity of the fish-eye is not
very different from our own, yet the sensitivity of the eyes or bodies of invertebrates is
not so well known.

The series referred to in Table I are plotted with other results in fig. 2, and provide
a measure of the blue transmission of the water for comparison with previous results for
blue, and with results obtained on the same days for other colours, as plotted in figs. 2,
3 and 4.

Table II illustrates the method of work, d representing the depth in metres, V the
vertical illumination in air in metre candles, and p the percentage reading of the
immersed photometer as compared with that for the same photometer on deck, allowance
