Accordingly, I made the experiments described below, and,
although they were not as accurately or minutely conducted as those on V. urtice, they
yield some valuable results, and entirely confirm the previously adopted conclusion
that the colour-etlects are due to larval and not to pupal sensitiveness. Being away
from my laboratory, and not expecting such an opportunity, it was, of course, impossible
to carry out the experiments in the most satisfactory manner. The results obtained
with the two species are described together, because they were, in nearly all cases,
kept under similar conditions and were, in fact, often placed in the same cylinders. Furthermore, the results were remarkably uniform. When no locality is mentioned
in any experiment it is understood that the included larvee were captured at Seaview.
