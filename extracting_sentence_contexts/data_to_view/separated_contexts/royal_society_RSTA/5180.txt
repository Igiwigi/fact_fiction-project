As the p

dependence can be but slight; in other words the orientation of the molecules d :
not involve any considerable additional kinetic energy of displacement of the medium

n comparison with the work done by electric forces ; just as was to be anticipated
rom § 117, where it has been shown that to produce a comparable motional effect
very great velocity of translation or rotation of the molecule is requisite, not the com-
paratively sinall velocity of movement of the elements of the medium caused by a
wave passing over it. This amounts in fact to asserting that it is only the electric inertia of the molecules
that affects the electric waves. Their material inertia is quite a different and secondary
thing from the inertia of the «ther ;* on an electric theory it can have no direct
influence on the radiation. It seems clear also that if the molecules, in their relations to the ether, behave as
systems of grouped electrons, their presence cannot disturb the fluidity of that
medium, so that the foundation given above (§ 28) for MacCuniagu’s dispersion
theory remains valid.
