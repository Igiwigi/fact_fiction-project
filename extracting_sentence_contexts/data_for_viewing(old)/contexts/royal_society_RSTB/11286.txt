as been a lively debate about whether aspects of human be-
aviour, such as cooperation, can be explained by cultural
group selection [44-51].

Studies may also differ between fields and between

researchers with regard to their economic assumptions about

uman behaviour. In psychology and behavioural economics,
most research is conducted in populations that might not
generalize to all humans; some researchers have coined the
term WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich and
Democratic) to underscore the fact that these are a small pro-
portion of all human populations, but are disproportionately
represented in experimental research [52-54]. Studies of
small-scale societies typically make different assumptions, and
often come to different conclusions, from research in industrial-
ized populations: norms of cooperation, sharing, punishment
and market forces are quite variable among human populations
[52]. This realization is important to many studies of human be-
haviour that have been approached from both a cultural
evolutionary and an economic perspective: assumptions and
generalizations about human behaviour require great care and
should be made explicit in studies involving economic forces,
game theory, balance of power, division of labour, subsistence
