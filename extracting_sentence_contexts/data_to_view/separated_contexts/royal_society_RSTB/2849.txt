Rarely one finds a heart pass very slowly towards the systolic position, but this is
almost certainly due to some change in the blood used. Such a sample of nutrient
fluid should, of course, be rejected, as it introduces fallacies into the research. Bearing the above facts in mind, one had to make a large number of tracings, both
normal and otherwise, and to carefully exclude all those into which fallacies, due to
the changes above described, had apparently crept. Some of these results are given in the subjoined table, and were selected from
tracings in which the heart was either very steady, or actually slowing, at the time
venom was introduced. (For tracings illustrating this section see Plate II.) Briefly,
the case may be thus stated. Solutions of Cobra venom of a strength of 1/250,000,
of 1/500,000, and even at times of 1/1,000,000 increase the rate of heart beat and kill
the organ in a position of systole.
