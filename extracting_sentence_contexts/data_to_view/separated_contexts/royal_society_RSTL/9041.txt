2 (5) Having observed these lines of demarcation between areas of different degrees of
excitability to be 80 well defined, I was led to *try cutting a spiral strip until the
> contractile waves became blocked, and then exploring the line of blockage by stimulus. = In all cases I found that if I stimulated a fraction of a millim. on the spiral strip
& <ide of this line, the spiral strip responded, while the uncut portion of the bell
<= remained passive; and, conversely, that if I stimulated the other side of this line,
5 the uncut portion of the bell responded, while the spiral strip remained passive, To
make the fact in question quite clear T may refer to'fig. 9, which represents a portion

of a broad strip wherein the contractile waves became blocked at the curved line

ab. On $timulating the tissue at any point as close as possible on one side of this line,

as at c, a contractile waye would start from that point, and course all the way along the

strip in the direction cd, but in that direction only ; while if the stimulus were applied

at any point on the other side of the line a6, as at e, the contractile wave thus originated
