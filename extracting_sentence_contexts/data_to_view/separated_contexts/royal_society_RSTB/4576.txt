This is not quite comparable with the ‘“syzygous” union ot
some plates near the peristome in many advanced Regular forms, for there it is
usually possible to trace the original limits of the components by the optic orientation
of their calcite or by differences in the stereom-mesh. No such tests resolve the
surviving primary of an Echinoid triad. The fact that the morphoneanic plates at


AMBULACRUM IN THE ECHINOIDEA HOLECTYPOIDA. 405

the apicad ends of the ambulacra in such advanced genera as Echinus or Hetero-
centrotus are developed in a reduced state is probably due to accelerated and
compressed recapitulation, in which the stages in the attainment of the reduction
have been omitted. In this connection it is appropriate to refer to the existence of
the “biporous ambulacrals” around the Spatangid peristome. The principle
enunciated above implies that it is possible that these might originally have been
two plates, although it would be premature to attempt any conclusion on the subject
here.
