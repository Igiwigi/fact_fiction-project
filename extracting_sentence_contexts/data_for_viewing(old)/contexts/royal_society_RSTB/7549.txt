SUMMARY

The first part of this paper is taken up with an historical survey of the relatively few
observations, some detailed and some less so, of internal seiches (internal standing waves)
in lakes. After a description of the thermo-electric thermometer employed (figure 2),
there follow details and illustrations of the evidence, from temperature observations, for
such internal waves in the northern basin of Windermere. Two main phases could be distin-
guished: (i) motion under wind stress leading to quasi-steady states with some or all of the
isotherms tilted (cf. figures 5, 8 and 21); (ii) internal seiche motion which developed after
the wind had dropped (figures 10, 12). These observations confirm the findings of Wedder-
burn and his collaborators on the Scottish Lochs (1907-15). The results from Windermere
are presented, not because any such confirmation is necessary, but in order to secure
belated recognition of the fact that Wedderburn’s ‘temperature seiche’ is not an isolated
phenomenon, but is an everyday feature of movement in stratified lakes subject to wind
action. As this movement is an important and largely unrecognized factor in lake environ-
ment, this paper is addressed mainly to limnologists. In its latter part, results of theoretical
analyses of a detailed series of observations (figures 8, 10) are presented in non-mathematical
form, The applicability of a theory of oscillations in a basin with three layers of differing
density (set out in an appendix by M. S. Longuet-Higgins) is tested by comparing (in
figure 19) theoretical and observed deflexions of selected isotherms from their equilibrium
levels, resulting from internal waves after a gale. This theory also enables horizontal
components of velocity and displacement to be calculated for each layer (figure 22).
Complicating factors in natural lakes are enumerated, and the influence of internal waves
on lake biology and sedimentation is discussed.
