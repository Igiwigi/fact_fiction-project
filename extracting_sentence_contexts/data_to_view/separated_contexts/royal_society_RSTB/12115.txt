Single-
cell pipetting with microcapillary tubes, manually or using
automated devices, is the simplest yet probably the most
widely used approach to isolating single eukaryotic cells for
diversity and ecological studies [14-16,36]. Albeit slow and
tedious, accurate observation of cells under the microscope
is sometimes essential to find the target cells in complex com-
munities where only morphological information is available
for cell identification. For high-throughput separation of
single cells, fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) systems
have been the most widely used instruments, both in model
systems and for studies concerning microbial ecology and
diversity in the environment [37]. In scRNA-seq applications,
FACS is used to select specific populations of interest and col-
lect single-cells in 96- or 384-well plates [38]. FACS can
simultaneously record multiple parameters for each sorted
cell and these metadata can be used together with single-
cell gene expression.
