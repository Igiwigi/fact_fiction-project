“NEW FORCE” OF M. J. THORE. 467

point seen at Experiments 66 to 69 when working with M. Tiorr’s apparatus ; in each
case the negative rotation is slight before the neutral point is reached, while the
positive rotation observed after neutrality increases rapidly in each case, until it

“eventually far exceeds the original movement.

In conclusion, I think I may consider as established by these experiments the
following results :— :

1. The broad facts of rotation as observed by M. THore are abundantly confirmed.

2. The numerous experiments in which the face and hot water are tested under the
same circumstances, and especially Experiments 46 and 47, prove that the action is
due to radiation alone.

3. Blackening the cylinder increases the action. This is especially shown in
Experiments 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15.

4. The action is slightly increased by blackening both cylinder and pillar.

5. The remarkable fact observed by M. Tuore that a fine fibre of silk brought
near the suspended cylinder produces rotation has been verified in Experiments 27
