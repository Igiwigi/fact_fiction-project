It has been said that the accuracy of these time measurements can be pushed to
almost any extent. In order to demonstrate this fact, and also to exhibit the high
mutual consistency of various determinations, I will here give another set of records
from a different specimen (fig. 13), from which the velocity of transmission is to be
determined by the Differential Method. In this case a new recorder was taken,
with a vibration frequency of 20 times per second. Hence the distance between any
two successive dots represents a time-interval of one-twentieth of a second. The
stimulus intensity was again 3. The lowest record gives us the result obtained when
the point of application of stimulus was 30 mm. away from the responding pulvinus.
The total time, T, is here seen to be 2°9 sec. The next record gives us the result
when the point of stimulation was at a distance of 20 mm. and the total time, T, is
