PEARSON AND MISS A. LEE ON THE DISTRIBUTION

at Whitby, and if we had them and worked out the Whitby-Southampton and
Whitby-Laudale correlations, it is unlikely that they would both be exactly equal,
and equal to 0°9373. In fact the correlation for a number of Yorkshire stations, with
both Laudale and Southampton, would have first to be worked out, and then the true
station having an exact causal relationship with Laudale and Southampton would
require to be found by interpolation. But we should expect stations not so far removed from the right position to have
their barometric height given in terms of those of Laudale and Southampton by an
approximately linear relation. Hence, to indicate to the reader that our conclusion
—namely, that a barometric correlation may pass into a causal relationship—is not
so paradoxical as may appear at first sight, we have endeavoured to test how far the
Stonyhurst height is a linear function of the heights at Laudale and Southampton.
