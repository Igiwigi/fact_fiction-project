- I failed totally in getting the O spectra.; for at the yery first discharge the mercury was
80 rapidly oxidated that not a glimmer could pass the thick deposit on the tube. This
singular energy is probably due to the presence of ozone in the electrolytic oxygen
(though-it was passed through a tube filled with silyerJeaf). I shall repeat the expe-
riment, passing it through a red-hot tube. This fact may explain the absorption of
oxygen in Geissler tubes, which was obseryed by PLicxer; for Hg yapour must be
present in them, as they are exhausted by a mercurial air pump. The deposit in CO
was black below, grey above: the first was dissolyed by nitric acid, the other not; it
was probably some form of carbon from the decompoxsition of the gas; of that, how-
ever, there was a large residue present. 'The spectrum of Hg vapour has a few very
brilliant lines, but the rest are narrow and faint on a very dark ground. I had
expected by comparing it with Pt, Hg vapour, Table II., to obtain at once the lines of
Platinum, which I supposed would be 8uperadded to those of Hg ; but, to my great
surprise, that spectrum has fewer lines (28, while the other has 48), and only three occur
in it which the other wants. A similar deficiency occurs in the gas spectra of Table
XXT.: N, C.P., wants 22 mercurial lines; N, R., 25; H, C.P., 20; CO, C.P., 12; and
CO, R., 30. These observations, it must be remarked, are strictly comparable; they
