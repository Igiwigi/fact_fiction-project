a natural frequency with short-circuited patches equal to ,/ Ki /m/2n = 29.59 Hz.

The restoring force surface method is used to characterize the mechanical nonlinearity at
higher excitation levels. Compared to the previous measurements, the forcing amplitude is
multiplied by 10 so as to approach 1 mm for the maximum displacement at the end of the beam.
The nonlinear restoring force fx, is available as it can be computed from the filtered temporal
series through

Ri = ft — mii* — cir* — KE ut, (4.3)

and its phase-space representation is given in figure 7a. The two-dimensional section
corresponding to u* =0 represented in figure 7b highlights the cubic nonlinearity induced by
the thin lamina: fNL = Kyu. In fact, a one-term harmonic balance approximation u~u* =
Usin(t + 5,) means that

Ro = Kn). (4.4)

A nonlinear coefficient Ky = 2.507 x 10? Nm~$ is then obtained by filtering the signal uw

and solving equation (4.4) by a least-squares method, which provides an excellent fit with a
normalized mean-squared error equal to 0.4%. Furthermore, from equation (2.7),

fi (it =0) =P Kui, (4.5)

which is the cubic approximation represented in figure 7a,b. This approximation offers a good
