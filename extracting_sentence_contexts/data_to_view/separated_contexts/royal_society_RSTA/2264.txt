So it is important to : s
compare the two mechanisms more closely and find which mechanism is the correct monopole : S
production mechanism at LHC. : s

On the surface, there seems nothing wrong with the Drell-Yan process, because in particle 18

physics all elementary interactions are supposed to be described by Feynman diagrams. But since
the monopole is a topological particle, it is not clear if this picture is correct. In fact, this picture
has a potentially critical shortcoming, that it does not take care of the fact that we need the change
of topology to produce the monopole. By contrast, the thermal production of the monopole is based on the change of topology
induced by the zero points of the Higgs vacuum. So here, the electromagnetic interaction through
the photon has no role in the monopole production.
