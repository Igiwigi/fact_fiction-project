© with the auricles) to remain quiescent. Stimulation of the nerve produced only a slight quickening of
& the anricular beats, and after the end of the stimulation a series of ventricular beats similur to what has
already been described when the yentricles were reduced to standstill either by clamping or heating the

= Muscarin, then, is apparently able to prevent the action of the vagus upon the
5 auricles when applied to the auricles and sinus alone, without thereby preventing the
Bs action of the nerve upon the ventricle.

S When atropin is applied to the sinus and auricles alone, then, simultaneously with
S the appearance of the slow vigorous beats thereby caused, the action of the vagus both
2 on the rate of rhythm and upon the force of the ventricular as well as the auricular
G contractions entirely disappears. In fact, atropin applied to the sinus and anricles
ES alone is as effective as when applied to the whole heart.

E Curare applied to the auricles and sinus alone is able to prevent the action of the
a vagus nerve upon the auricular muscle, as far, at all events, as the diminution of the
© force of the contractions is concerned, without, as in the case of muscarin, greatly
S diminishing the” force of the auricular contractions, while at the same time it leaves
5 intact the action of the nerve upon the force of the ventricular contractions.

= When any one of these three poisons is applied to the ventricle alone, the action of
the vagus upon the force of the ventricular contractions is gradually removed without
affecting its action upon the rhythm of the heart or upon the force of the auricular
contractions. The usual sequence of events is as follows :-—Soon after the application
