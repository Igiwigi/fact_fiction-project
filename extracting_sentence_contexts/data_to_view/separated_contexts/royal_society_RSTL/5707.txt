Shed from the vessels, it is liberated from an influence which previously kept in check
a spontaneous proneness to coagulation. Hence it seems likely that a foreign 80liq
introduced into a vein acts not by creating a disposition. to aggregate on the part of the
fibrine, but by increasing a pre-existing tendency to it (as a thread induces the crystal-
lization of sugar-candy), exalting the mutual attraction of its particles to a degree which
overcomes a counteracting agency on the part of the tissnes. Further inquiry will, in all probability, throw clearer light upon this subject, bub
the meantime the facts already known furnish to the unaided senses indisputable proof
of the fundamental principle to which we were led by microscopical observation, viz,
that the tissues through which the blood flows have, when healthy, special relations to
the vital fluid, by virtue of which it is maintained in a fit state- for transmission
through the vessels. Further, the differences of adhesiveness in the corpuscles accord-
ing as the blood is surrounded by healthy tismnes or ordinary matter, can now be no
longer matter of surprise, knowing as we do the alterations which take place in the
chemical condition of the liquor sanguinis in consequence of such changes of circum-
stances, and also the great effect produced upon the adhesiveness of the red discs in
blood outside the body by slight variations in the quality of the plasma *. The freedom from attraction for the fibrine, if not the actual repulsion of it, on the part
of the walls of healthy blood-vessels, seems to explain the well-known fact in pathology,
that when healthy capillaries are subjected to abnormal pressure in consequence of venous
obstruction, the fluid squeezed through their parietes consists almost exclusively of sexum;
the fibrine being apparently excluded from their pores as liquid mercury is from those
of flannel, or any other texture composed of a material destitute of attraction for it.
