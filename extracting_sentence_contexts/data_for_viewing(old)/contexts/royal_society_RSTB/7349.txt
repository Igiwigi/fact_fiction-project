reflected from water which was being ruffled by a breeze; (c) daylight reflected from
particles in granolithic non-skid stair-treads. The colours seen were always either pale
orange-red or pale blue-green, as would be expected because of the antichromatic responses.

An explanation is needed, not of the appearance of colours which presumably are due to
the stimulation of receptors with specific colour response, but of the rareness with which
colours are perceived. The explanation appears to be as follows. If the source which
produces an image on the retina, subtends so small an angle, and is of such feeble
illumination that it stimulates only one receptor, then the latter responds with a colourless
sensation, because the angle and intensity are such as to cause colourless foveal vision under
the action of the antichromatic responses. If, on the other hand, the visual angle and
intensity are such as to cause the recognition of colour, then several receptors are stimu-
lated, some of one response, some of another, and the fact that the stimulus is a colourless
one is at once recognized. Thus the test object remains white almost all the time. Occasion-
ally, however, the image falls on receptors with the same response, when the colour sensa-
tion proper to those receptors is momentarily appreciated.

The reason why it is necessary for the source to be intermittent is probably accounted
for as follows. When once the source has been recognized as white, it appears to remain
white under conditions where a new source would be judged to be coloured. The mechanism
which is responsible for this is probably the same as, or similar to, the one which prevents
the perception of scotomata or coloured dots when a uniform surface is being looked at.

There is evidence that the fovea plays a part in the perception by the more peripheral
