It is assumed in the proof that m and 1+g are each of them positive; but, as appears
by the second example, the theorem is true for the extreme value m=0; it does not,
however, appear that the proof can be extended to include the extreme value q=—1. The formula seems, however, to hold good for valnes of m, q beyond the foregoing limits ;
and it would seem that the only necessary conditions are 48+g, 1+m, and 1+q+m,
each of them positive. The theorem is in fact a particular case of the following one,
