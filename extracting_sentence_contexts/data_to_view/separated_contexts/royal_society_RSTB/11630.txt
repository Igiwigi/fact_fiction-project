Something similar has been shown for African ran- a
gelands, where native wildlife ranching may, particularly in more arid and less productive conditions, be more profitable S
than livestock farming [96]. Rewilding rangelands would not only come with economic and greenhouse emission benefits. &
It could, for example, also have major advantages for human health since game meat contains higher proportions of unsa-
turated fatty acids [97]. In fact, a central aspect of rewilding our rangelands should include rewilding our diet, where the =
focus should be on eating less meat and eating proportionally more non-ruminant meat (kangaroos, suids, equids, camelids). =
Moreover, it could contribute towards restoring degraded rangelands, including issues with soil degradation and hydrology a
[94]. Cloete et al. [96] highlighted that there may be high capital investments involved with converting a traditional farm into =
a game farm. However, if this leads to major reductions in greenhouse emissions, governments should consider subsidizing <
such capital investments through ‘green subsidies’ or green tax benefits.
