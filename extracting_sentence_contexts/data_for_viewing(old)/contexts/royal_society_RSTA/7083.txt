First of all, we expect the rate of advance of a step in the crystal surface to be a definite
function of the distance x) between kinks in the step, because although x, is always small,
the diffusion of solute molecules towards the kinks, either through the solution, on the
surface or in the edge of the step, is now much slower than on the free surface of a crystal. It
is difficult to decide the relative importance of these three currents. For instance, the ratio
between the current through the solution and on the surface will be represented by the
factor DN,a/D,n,, where D and D, are the diffusion coefficients and N, and n,9 the saturation
concentrations in the solution and on the surface respectively; it is likely that D>D, but
also Nja<n,o, therefore the factor above may be greater or smaller than 1. Nevertheless, for
the time being and in order to simplify the problem, we shall suppose that the contributions
from the diffusion on the surface and in the edge can be neglected. Even under these condi-
tions we find another difficulty in the fact that neglect of the motion of the sinks is no longer
generally justifiable.

Let us suppose we have a set of parallel steps, at distance y, from each other, in one of the
close-packed crystallographic directions (for which x), the distance between successive
kinks, isa maximum). As an approximation the diffusion through the solution can be broken
up as follows: At distances r<xp from each kink we have a hemispherical diffusion field
around each kink (provided D/v,;,,5>%, otherwise the movement of the kink cannot be
neglected) with the diffusion potential (1—a/r) o(x)), where a(x ) is the supersaturation at
a distance x); at distances r between x, and y, from each step we have a semi-cylindrical
diffusion field around each step (provided D/v,.-)>¥o) with the diffusion potential
