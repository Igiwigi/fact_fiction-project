The authors suggested a one-step isomerization
process where r-Ca(1Ag) is directly attained from L-Ca(t Ag) via a Cg transition structure similar to
dl-C4(1A’). Clearly, their result differs dramatically from our own MR result. In fact, as noted by
the authors themselves, the use of DFT on electronic structure calculations of carbon clusters can
be notoriously complicated due to their intrinsic multistate character [183].
