This coagulation takes the form of a spongework, and the “fibrils ” arise within
its walls ; they follow the outline of the alveoli of the spongework, and so pursue a
sinuous spiral course, which persists in the completely calcified enamel. Their mode
of origin also accounts for the dilated “joint” and abrupt bend so often seen at the
point of junction with the dentine. The fibrils are resistant to acids and alkalis, usually attract an acid stain, are
precipitated at a relatively small concentration of calcium salts, for which they
exhibit a feeble adsorption affinity, as is shown by the fact that they do not become
impregnated by the calcium, and in ground sections of fully formed enamel they
frequently become detached, as though they lay imbedded in the calcified matrix,
but were not attached intimately to it. The development of this system of “ fibrils” is associated with certain well-defined
changes in the enamel-cells not seen in the development of non-fibrillar enamel for
these cells—the ameloblasts—pass through a stage where they undergo a great
increase in length, the greater part of the cytoplasm becomes transformed into
metaplasm, a fine cytomitoplasm remaining, whilst the cells lose their marked
individual columnar form, Coincidently the nuclei become much reduced in size, and
in the greater number of cases assume an irregular form,
