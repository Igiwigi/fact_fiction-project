In
this instance the strobilus is evidently sustained by a short, arrested lateral twig,
corresponding to one of the Halonial tubercles. The sections, figs. 1, 5, further
establish another morphological fact, viz, that the young branches of a Lepido-
dendron may have a vascular bundle devoid of all visible traces of a cellular medulla,
and yet such a medulla may be developed in its interior at a later stage of growth. In some of my earlier memoirs I advanced the hypothesis that age produced
other morphological changes, beyond mere growths, in these Lepidodendroid plants. To
this M. Renavtr replied, speaking of LZ.
