Abelian group, we associate with A a particular Abelian group P* together with a homo-
morphism @* of A into P*. This group is generated by elements

a* = ag*
corresponding to the elements a of A; the defining relations of P* are
atht = cr
whenever a* = af*, b+ = 6+, c* = cb* and
ab=c
in A; and, moreover, atbt = (brat
for every pair of generators a* = af*, bt = b0* of P*. It is not difficult to see that P* is iso-

morphic to the factor group of the canonic group P’ with respect to its commutator group.
One proves the following facts in complete analogy to theorem (9:1):

Tueorem. [f7 is a homomorphism of the amalgam A into an Abelian group P, then there is a homo-
morphism @ of the group P* into P such that
1 = 9.

If n is one-to-one, then 0* must be one-to-one. The amalgam is embeddable in an Abelian group if, and
only if, the homomorphism * is one-to-one. (10-1)

If @* is one-to-one, then we say that P* is ‘the generalized free sum (or free Abelian
product) of the amalgam (or of the groups G, with amalgamated H,,)’.
