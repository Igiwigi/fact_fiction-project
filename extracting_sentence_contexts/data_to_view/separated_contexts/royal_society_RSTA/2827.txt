These would
have looked spectacular, like the lava flows around the Siberian Traps eruptions, but their role
in causing global extinction might have been modest. Forest fires happen all the time, and may
devastate ecosystems locally or regionally, but life soon recovers and heals the scars. In fact, wildfires were common throughout the Permian and right through to the PTB, and then
there is a long gap during the Early Triassic and much of the Middle Triassic, when fossil charcoal
is not reported, or was at least very rare, as were other indicators of fire, including inertinites and
pyrogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons [64]. Wildfire has been posited at the PTB at Meishan
in South China, based on abundant charcoal, black carbon and carbon spherules [14]. Wildfire can
kill directly as forests were burnt down, but most animals would have been able to flee.
