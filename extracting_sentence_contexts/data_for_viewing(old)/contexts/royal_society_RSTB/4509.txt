serious loss of the expired air by leakage backwards through the inspiratory valve.
We always took care to keep the valves as vertical as possible with the inspiratory
valve lowermostâ€”an important point, as the mica dises of the Siebe Gorman valves
are closed only by gravity and are not assisted by a spring.

always found the position rather irksome. This may account for the high respiratory
exchange shown by Hoxson when at rest, for this was more than one would have
expected even when one allowed for the fact that Hopson was bigger and of greater
muscular development than Dovenas. Hopson was in far better muscular condition
than Doue.as, who was quite out of training.

All our experiments were commenced about: two hours after taking a light
breakfast. In some respects this is an undesirable feature, but as Brenepicr and
Catucart's experiments,* which were made on a subject in the post-absorptive state,
i.e., when he had taken no food for the previous 12 hours, show the same type of
changes as do our experiments, we can feel tolerably certain that though the food
may have influenced the degree of the changes of the respiratory exchange caused by
the muscular work in our experiments, it has not seriously influenced their general
character.
