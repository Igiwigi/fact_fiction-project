discovered. Subsequently, on cutting one of the ovaries into sections, I found (in
addition to the young corpus luteum which is described in the next section) a
degenerate follicle, which, judging from its size and position, which were those of a
nearly ripe follicle, and its state of degeneration had probably attained complete
ripeness before undergoing atresia. The membrana granulosa had almost entirely
disappeared, its few remaining cells being in an advanced stage of degeneration.
Very little ingrowth of connective tissue from the thece had occurred, and what had
was looser and more irregular than the normal ingrowth. ‘The cavity contained a
fluid resembling the liquor of the Graafian follicle, but staining somewhat more deeply.
There was no blood-clot, such as sometimes occurs in atretic follicles in the rabbit's
ovaries, nor any indication that there had been a breaking down of vessels, or rupture
to the exterior. No recognisable trace of the ovum was found, but this may have
been due to the fact that some sections were unfortunately lost in the cutting.

The special interest attaching to this observation lies in the possibility ot the
atretic follicle having attained complete maturation and afterwards undergone
degeneration owing to want of sufficient stimulus to induce ovulation.
