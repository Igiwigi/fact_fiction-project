Recently, they have
received new attention in the context of the design and optimal actuation of novel bioinspired
robotic devices [21,22], and they are still the object of study and debate [23-27]. Among the possible explanations, one is that these movements arise as an overcompensatory
response to perturbations due to the (slow) bio-chemo-mechanical machinery the plant uses
to control its vertical posture. In fact, nutations in growing plant shoots may be described as
spontaneous oscillations caused by a flutter-like instability (a Hopf-type bifurcation) in a growing
elastic system subject to gravity loading while sensing and actively responding to external
stimuli. We have discussed the merits of this hypothesis in previous studies [28,29] and, in
this paper, we study in detail the impact of different growth models on the qualitative and
quantitative features of these spontaneous oscillations. To this aim, we model the system using
the theory of morphoelastic growing rods discussed in [30].
