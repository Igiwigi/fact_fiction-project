Spatio-temporal
PP patterns dictate OM vertical export and the quality of OM delivered to the seafloor [4,15,16],
which is reflected in benthic ecosystem structure [17,18]. Therefore, climate change-driven
perturbations to this Arctic system can lead to large, yet unquantified, disruptions of ecosystem
functioning in the Barents Sea. In fact, there is evidence of long-term summer sea ice retreat
[12,19], resulting in sea ice loss and an expansion of the seasonal ice zone [10]. Recent modification
of summer sea ice dynamics has been attributed to strengthening of AW inflow in the southern
Barents Sea region, forcing the PF towards the northern and north-eastern shelf, resulting in an
‘Atlantification’ of the northern Barents Sea [5,11,13]. In addition to sea ice retreat, disruption to
water column stratification and associated deepening of the mixed layer result in increased PP
due to enhanced nutrient recycling and replenishment, as well as longer duration of blooms [8].
