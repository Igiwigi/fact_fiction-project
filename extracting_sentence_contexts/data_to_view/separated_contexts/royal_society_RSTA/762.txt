The economist makes some (often
heroic) assumptions about the nature of firms and consumers and then deduces how resources are
allocated in the economy. Thus, while attempting to be descriptive and predictive, the approach
is really normative in nature. It in fact outlines how the world should be ideally (if all the
assumptions were fulfilled). The engineering approach, by contrast, is less utopian (as it does
not make as many heroic assumptions), but is nevertheless normative as it is concerned with
what firms ought to do, not what they actually do. By contrast, frugal innovation is a descriptive notion based on and drawn from the actual
practices of firms.
