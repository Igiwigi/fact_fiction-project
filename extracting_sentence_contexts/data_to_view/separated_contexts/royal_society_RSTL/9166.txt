On arresting the movement of the fly by means of a magnet, the bulb was seen
to rotate in the opposite direction. The movement, however, was feeble, and with
difficulty could be kept up for any length of time, owing to the friction of the
platinum wires in the mercury cups. Having demonstrated the fact of rotation,
further experiments seemed unnecessary.

Q decided manner, further experiments were tried in this direction, as it was thought
© that the results might throw further light on the theory of the movement. I Vig. 28.
