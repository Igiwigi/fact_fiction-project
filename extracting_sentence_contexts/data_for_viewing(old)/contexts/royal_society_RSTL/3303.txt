mocks and wide floes, rises over the tidal wave, 80 did the earth's crust with its
mountains and plains rise on the convex surfaces of molten rock, under the influence
of the great secular changes then in progress.

After these considerations I am far from thinking it an overwhelming difficulty,
that the curyature of the shelves of Glen Roy over a space of four, or five, or perhaps
even twenty miles shonld appear to be the same with that of the surface of the ocean,
within that limit of accuracy which the nature of the case renders possible. On the
contrary, I deduce from their curyature, first, that the district of Lochaber formed
only a small part of the area affected ; secondly, a confirmation of the view, which I
deduced from the phenomena observed in South America, that the motive power in
such cases is a slight additional convexity slowly added to the fluid nucleus; and
thirdly, this additional fact, that we thus obtain some measure of the degree of homo-
geneous fluidity of the subterranean matter beneath a large area, namely, that its par-
ticles, when acted on by a disturbing force, arrange themselves in obedience to the
law of gravity. And although we arrive at this conclusion with some surprise, when
relating to the abysses of the nether regions, we see it habitually verified in volcanic
countries, where a torrent of laya, checked by some obstacle, has expanded into a
level sheet.

Mr. LyzLL, in his Principles of Geology®, quotes a passage from Sir Joun Herscner's
AstronomyF, to show that whatever may have been the original figure of the earth,
the wearing down of the solid matter and its redeposition at the bottom of the sea,
must tend continually to change the actual figure of the earth, as PLayrairF expresses
it, into the s/atical one: he then adds, © that the same remark applies to every stream
