The fact that this flow of water is in the opposite direction to
that observed at the surface, which for the most part sets from the equator towards
the poles, is explained by attributing the counterflow to undercurrents. If however
we subject the question to the test of mathematical analysis, we shall find that
though such a flow towards the equator must necessarily exist, it is so slow as to be
completely masked by larger currents due to other causes. ‘The flow in question
will however give rise indirectly, in consequence of the rotation, to currents which
in the absence of dissipative forces would tend to increase without limit. The
explanation of this fact will be obvious after the discussions of § 11. The effects of evaporation and precipitation may be conveniently represented
mathematically by an appropriate distribution of sources and sinks over the free
surface. This will modify the surface-conditions at the free surface but will not
interfere with the dynamical equations.
