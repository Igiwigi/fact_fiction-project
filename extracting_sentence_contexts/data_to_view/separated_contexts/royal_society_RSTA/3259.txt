If one considers not only a single time interval to but [=
a number of time intervals, f/ = nto, one should write the transition rate in more general terms. : 8
Formally, equation (2.6) should then be replaced by : —

In equations (3.3), we have taken the integration limits from 0 to t, because we assume that the :3
process begins at t = 0. An alternative extreme possibility which is also often adopted would have :$
been to assume that the process began at t = —oo. Since, in fact, the relaxation times are relatively :
short compared to macroscopic observation times, these different expressions are essentially
equivalent. The corresponding transition kernels W(C),,Cy,t — t’) and W(Cy, Cy, t — t’) may have different
forms, depending on the various pathways for relaxation to local thermodynamic equilibrium [16,
20]. The simplest exponential form in t — t’,

Equation (3.4) is the hyperbolic master equation describing change of phase state with exponential
relaxation to local thermalization.
