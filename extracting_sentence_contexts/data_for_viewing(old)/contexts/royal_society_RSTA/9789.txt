only, independently of the range of stress, which may be zero. As HJE is continuous
with BC, it seems possible that an extension such as GH may be produced by the
repetition of a cycle of stress in which the range is less than the safe range.

Should further experiments bear out this contention, it seems that very great care
must be exercised in the use of materials having a higher maximum stress than that
corresponding to alternations of equal and opposite stresses.

Below the static yield-point, iron and steel appear to be capable of maintaining an
unstable condition for a considerable time against cyclical variations of stress which
ultimately produce a considerable change of length. The first application of the
maximum stress in a given cycle may show only a scarcely measurable extension,
in spite of the fact that extension of thousands of times the amount may be obtained
without any change in the cycle of stresses. It would appear from this that

the first signs of want of elasticity, and that fatigue increases these signs to
recognisable magnitude.
