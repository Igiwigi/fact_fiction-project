development of the uranium halo. In the first stages we have a delicate ring which
is clearly representative of, although not accurately agreeing with, the remarkable
maximum which is placed at the distance in air of 2°2 cm. from the centre or origin.
Later we find this ring darkened up inside, and the first appearances of RaC
presented as a faint outlying ring. But here there is plainly a discordance. The
appearance of the shell due to RaC should be delayed till a much later stage in the
development of the halo. Plainly, according to the ionisation curve, the central
pupil should be carried out in air to a distance of about 4°5 cm. before the first
indications of the outermost band appear. In the development of the region lying
between the minimum of ionisation (at 4°8 cm.) and the embryonic ring two distinct
shells may be detected.

These facts of observation show that the uranium halo develops very much as if
the inverse square law did not operate at all or acted but partially, and it‘is evident
that the final state of a halo according to fig. 1 is quite in accordance with the
photographs referred to above. In a word, the development of the halo, as observed,
indicates that for some reason the divergence of the rays which should lead to the
obliteration of the features of the ionisation curve of fig. 1, is counteracted, and the
maxima of the several rays, which contribute to the formation of the curve, sustained.
I may add here that in the case of the development of the thorium halo the adherence
of its genesis to the curve of ionisation derived from the integration of parallel rays
is even more striking.

I suggest the following explanation, although in itself invoking the aid of very
obscure phenomena. It is known that the first effects of stimuli applied to the
