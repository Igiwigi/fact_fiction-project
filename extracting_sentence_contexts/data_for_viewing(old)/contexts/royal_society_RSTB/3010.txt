Physical deductions cannot, however, be applied to living organisms if unsupported
by direct experiment. As a matter of fact experiment showed that using 50-centim.

lengths cut from transpiring branches, the amount of flow
ce eadof water though influenced by the temperature, altered to a less extent
than would be expected from the changes of viscosity. This
is probably owing to the presence of air in the vessels, which,
ay apart from, the expansion and contraction caused by the changes
| of temperature, and from the more rapid solution at the lower
temperature, would exercise a resistance to flow slightly increased
by a fall of temperature owing to the increased surface-tension
of the air-bubbles in the vessels. In fact, after passing water
through for some time under pressure it was found that the
amount of flow became much more nearly proportional to the
viscosity.

Accordingly test experiments were made upon short lengths
of stems which had been previously fully saturated with water.
The stems (crab apple) were fixed as shown in the figure, and
surrounded by water led from a large vessel containing water at
a known temperature. The current was regulated so that the
temperatures of the issuing and entering streams did not differ
by more than a degree, when the temperature of the entering
stream was taken as that of the stem. At 0Â° C. the stem was
