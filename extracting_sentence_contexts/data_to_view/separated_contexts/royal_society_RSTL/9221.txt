It seems, however, that but slight mechanical disturbance suffices to shake
ont the diminution of magnetization left at the end of each of these experiments. 228. The general lagging of effect is shown by the fact that in every ascending
branch the curve is lower than in the immediately previous descending branch ; and
the dotted latter halves of the long curves of the Diagrams XXIV. to XXIX. show,
by the intersections of their convex portions near the zero, that if the experiment was
continued long enough, the history of the variation of magnetization would in every
case be represented by a curve like that in the annexed sketech,
