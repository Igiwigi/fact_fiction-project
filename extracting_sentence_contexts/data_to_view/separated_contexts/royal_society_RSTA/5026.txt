The majority of F connections of Ag(II) are
thermodynamically stable; elimination of F2 becomes facile only for Ag(III) derivatives, such as
AgF; (at temperatures above 20°C) or AgF salts (at temperatures above +300°C and in dynamic
vacuum [30]). Lack of thermodynamic stability of certain Ag(II) salts may be rather proponouced as
exemplified by AgSO,. This black compound decomposes thermally at temperatures above 110°C
according to the following equation:

2Ag(II)*(SO4) > Ag(1)9(S207) + 502 t- (6.3)

Nevertheless, Ag(II)SO4 is metastable at ambient (p,T) conditions and despite the fact that
the equilibrium pressure of oxygen exceeds 1TPa (sic!). However, AgSO, undergoes slow
decomposition yielding the low-pressure form of Ag(I)2(S2O7) at ultra-high vacuum conditions
[23] and yielding the high-pressure form of Ag(I)2(S2O7) at pressures exceeding 23GPa in a
diamond anvil cell [29].

7. Distortions: small but stubborn

As for all ‘localized’ d? systems, the compounds in the solid state containing Ag(II) are susceptible
to a Jahn-Teller (JT) effect.
