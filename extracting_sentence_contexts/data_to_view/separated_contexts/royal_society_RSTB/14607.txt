By contrast, forget, remember, wonder etc. are
used much less frequently [27]. Given the overall frequency
with which know and think are produced, they might be
produced equally often and interchangeably. Alternatively,
children might be sensitive to a fundamental difference
between them, notably that know, unlike think, is a factive
verb, in which the truth of the complement is assumed. With respect to relative frequency, recent evidence based
ona large sample of English-speaking children (n = 130) indi-
cates that in the 4-year period between 12- and 60-months,
know is produced more frequently than think and has a some-
what earlier onset [28], consistent with the proposal that
childrenâ€™s conceptualization of knowledge, as opposed to
belief, is likely to be foundational for their theory of mind
[29]. Moreover, this differential frequency cannot be attribu-
ted to adult input.
