H. HUXLEY ON THE ANATOMY OF THE MEDUSZE.

therefore, when viewed by transmitted light, appear like four thick fibres. The vesicle
is about 55th of an inch in diameter, more spherical in small than in large indiyi-
duals; it contains a closely-packed mass of strongly-refracting granules 555th of an
inch, more or less, in diameter. 'The outer membrane of the pedicle can be traced
over the vesicle, and the inner probably passes under it, separating the cavity of the
pedicle from the vesicle : the dense mass of granules prevents this from being actually
seen, but from analogy with Mesonema, &c., I have no doubt of the fact.

28. ExrENBERG, in his description of the Medusa aurita, says, © Le p6doneule
est attach6 & une v6sicule, dans lequel on remarque, sous le microscope, un corps
glanduleux, jaundtre lorsque la lumitrele traverse et blanchatre lorsque cette dernidre
est r6fl6chie. De ce corps il part deux branches qui se dirigent vers le p6doncule du
corps brun jusqu'a s0n petit bouton on t&te.” And further on, © Le corps bifurqu6
plac6 & Ja base du corps brun parait &re un ganglion neryeux, et ses deux branches
peuvent &tre regard6es comme des nerfs optiques.” I must confess that, judging by
what I have observed in Rhizosfoma and Phacellophora, it appears to me that these
80-called nervous branches passing on each side of the pedicle towards its head, are
nothing more than the optical expression of the thickness of the two membranes of
which the pedicle is composed ; and a very similar explanation may, I think, be given
of his intertentacular ganglia, which appear to be nothing more than the optical
expression of the thickened walls of the circular canal.
