The shocks Nos. D5 and D6 which occurred on 3 June give the same value
for the P-S separation time. They were of very small amplitude as recorded in
Montserrat, the maximum deflexions in the seismograph record being 0-6 and 4:5 mm.
respectively, and such shocks would not be perceived with the unaided senses by an
observer in Montserrat. These shocks were, however, so perceived in Antigua, and
the shocks were described as coming from the direction of Montserrat. These facts
taken together suggest that the common focus of these two earthquakes was under the
sea between Montserrat and Antigua, and considerably nearer to Antigua than
to Montserrat. If this interpretation is correct, we can make an estimate of the

velocity, v, and v, using the value 1-78 for the ratio v,/v,. The value so found is
2:1 km./sec. for the P waves. This value depends on the assumption that the focus
was 31 km. from Plymouth, the distance of St John’s, Antigua, to Plymouth being
37 km. The value should be regarded as an upper limit.
