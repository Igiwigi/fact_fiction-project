Predicted
long ago, on the basis of electronic structure calculations, to possess the perfect
spin polarization that is the defining characteristic of the half-metal [31], there
have been extensive experimental efforts to realize this in a thin film suitable for
a spintronic device. The extreme sensitivity of the spin polarization to defects in
the ordered crystal lattice of these compounds has made this a long and arduous
search, but excellent progress has recently been made. Molecular and organic electronics is another very promising research area in its
own right, and given the fact that carbon is a light element, and hence has a weak
spin-orbit interaction—permitting long spin lifetimes—carbon-based systems are
very promising as a platform of spintronic devices. Spin transport in carbon
nanotubes [32] and graphene [33] has been demonstrated but the effects are
difficult to realize reliably and such materials are far from being manufacturable
at present. On the other hand, with organic light-emitting diodes already in
widely available products, such as smartphone displays, the molecular approach
to carbon-based electronics offers great promise.
