8. Curved boundaries The theory of the treatment of curved boundaries in the biharmonic equation is not more
difficult than in the corresponding harmonic case; in one important particular, in fact, the
problem is easier. This arises from the form of the boundary conditions, which usually
specify both the function and its normal derivative. This is equivalent to specifying the
function and its boundary derivative in all directions, in particular in the direction of
