The autopsy revealed that both frontal lobes and both angular gyri had been
destroyed, the frontal lobe and angular gyrus being rather more extensively
removed on the left side. The condition of the cerebrum is shown in Plate 1, fig. 2. The facts qui ocular movements as ascertained from this experiment indicate :â€”

1. That both frontal lobes may be removed without any impairment in the
movements of the eyeballs other than a temporary inability to turn them
to the side away from the lesion ;

2. That in addition to the frontal lobes the angular gyri may be removed without
any further impairment in the movements of the eyes or of the eyelids.
