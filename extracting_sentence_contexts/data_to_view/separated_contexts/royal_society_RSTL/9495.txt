If we express 0 of these variables as functions of the rest and call them 2's, putting
n for m—0O, we can write

hom) +hþ(1)+ - - - +hh lg =wth$ (4) + : tho o(2):

Or making, as we may, the ks each=unity we have shown how to find the
expression required,*

* The 8ubscript letters attached here, and not before, to the functional symbols introduce no novelty. They are only intended to suggest the fact that what we have written y-(z1), y-(#g) . - - are really y-(z1, 91),
V(g, vg), - - +; While yy and yy . . .
