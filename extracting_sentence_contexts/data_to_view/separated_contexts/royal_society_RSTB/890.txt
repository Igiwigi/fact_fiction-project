Bearing i
mind the complex conditions of the conflict, we are forced to conclude that th
organisms against which the Frog is not immune may be found either at one end
at the other end of the series, or at both. Yeast, in its most virulent form, represents to a certain extent the middle of
series. Clusters of yeast cells are attacked by the eosinophile cells, just as ar
anthrax chains, aud to these come hyaline cells; in fact, the story is the same
that which has already been related. At the same time hyaline cells will inge
stray yeast cells which have not been attacked by eosinophile cells. The notes Â¢

one experiment will illustrate this.
