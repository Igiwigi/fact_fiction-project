eries of measurements would, in many cases, appear to be almost insuperable. It
Swould be necessary to introduce corrections for the loss of light in the spectroscope,
gad the determination of the magnitudes of these corrections would necessarily be a
"gnatter of considerable difficulty. Measurements have been made of the relative
#intensities of spectrum lines with the spectrophotometer. With this instrument it
“is difficult to attain any high degree of accuracy, and the range of wave-length over
‘which it can be used is small unless the intrinsic intensity of the radiations is very
eat. It is, moreover, necessary to encounter the difficulty referred to above of
Smaintaining the light source constant during a series of measurements.
© Inarecent paper,t we have discussed the application of a method, involving the
“Zuse of a neutral-tinted wedge, to the determination of the distribution of intensity in
“Bbroadened spectrum lines. In this case, the problem is reduced to its simplest form
Bowing to the fact that over the short range of wave-length covered in a single
‘Sbroadened line, we may consider that both the extinction-coefficient of the wedge
"Zand the sensibility of the photographic plate remain constant. Sucha method cannot
Bbe applied directly to the present problem without important modifications and
additions, for in the measurement of the relative intensities of lines of widely
different wave-length neither of these essential conditions is even approximately
§ fulfilled, and, in addition, the loss of light in the spectroscope must be considered.
& The problem dealt with in the present communication is therefore of an essentially
g different nature, but it has been found possible to evade these difficulties without
8 altering the character of the method employed.
E The apparatus used in the investigation is identical with that which we have
A described previously} and consists of a spectrograph, in front of the slit of which is
mounted a neutral-tinted glass wedge, cemented to a similar wedge of colourless
