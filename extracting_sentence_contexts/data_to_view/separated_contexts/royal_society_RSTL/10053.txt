The close resemblance between the Nauplius of Incifer, and Mirizr's and
MerTscHNICKOFF's larva, renders it almost certain that they also are Malacostracan
laryz, but before this corroborative evidence was furnished, it was certainly quite
possible, although hardly reasonable, to doubt whether this was true of either of them. I.—Trz SEGMENTATION OF THE EGG, AND FORMATION OF THE F00D-YOLK AND

Lucifer, and the observations which T have been able to make are incomplete, and
leave many gaps to be filled and many interesting points to be decided by future
investigations ; but the facts which I have made out are 80 novel, 80 different from all
that was previously known of the early stages of Arthropod development, and they
throw s0 mneh light upon the relation of the peculiar and greatly modified form of
segmentation characteristic of the group to the less modified form of segmentation
presented by the more normal eggs of other animals, that it, seems best, to give my
resuJts in their present incomplete tate. I am the more willing to do this, because the peculiar difficulties of the subject leave
little hope for the attainment of more complete results in the future,

The eggs are 80 loosely attached to the appendages of the female that they are
broken off by the slightest roughness of handling, and it is very difficult to obtain them
by collecting the egg-bearing females. Even when great numbers of mature specimens
are captured in the breeding season, with the greatest care and delicacy, very few of

the collection is examined.
