e-mail: nadia.guerouaou@chru-lille.fr The human facial and vocal expressions have evolved as signals to inform and
manipulate others [1,2]. By continuously modulating our facial muscles and the
phonatory and articulatory structures of our vocal apparatus, we provide a rich,

emotional states such as joy or surprise [3,4], our social intents such as warmth
or dominance [5,6], or our epistemic attitudes, such as certainty or doubt [7,8].
