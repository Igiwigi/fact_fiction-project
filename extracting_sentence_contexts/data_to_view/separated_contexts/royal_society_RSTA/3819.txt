412Â° MR. J. H. JEANS ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF MOLECULAR ENERGY. We shall assume that these co-ordinates are principal co-ordinates of the system, so
that-both the kinetic and potential energies will be the sums of squares. We may,
in fact, write

WV = 67, + ore +... oF ore
2T = me? + 2Q + 28S

where

2Q = big?
