is to rely on a discretization of the velocity space, which leads to the discrete velocity Boltzmann
equation (DVBE) based on the BGK operator [37]

If the above velocity discretization is done in such a way that the matching conditions between
discrete and continuous moments

are satisfied up to the order p+q+r=n, then the macroscopic behaviour of interest is
automatically satisfied up to the same order n [2,14]. In fact, there are several ways to enforce
them. The most popular ones rely on the maximum entropy principle (MEP), the moment-
matching approach or the (Gauss-Hermite) quadrature-based methodology. For the latter two
approaches, strict conditions must be satisfied by the velocity discretization in order to obtain an
analytical formulation of the discrete equilibrium. f. ‘4 [3-5]. Interestingly, in the context of the MEP,
it is possible to obtain a general formulation of the discrete equilibrium that does not necessarily
depend on the velocity discretization considered. This particular form of the equilibrium is obtained
considering the following H-function [55]
