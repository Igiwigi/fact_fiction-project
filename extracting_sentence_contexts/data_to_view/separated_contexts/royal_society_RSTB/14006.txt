It would seem implausible to argue
that laughter group size increased but then later decreased so
dramatically: evolution does not usually work like that. In summary, this would suggest that laughter most likely
emerged to solve the bonding demands of early Homo rather
than those of archaic humans. If so, then it evolved long
before language, which would accord with the fact that
language is not essential for laughter [3]. The earliest likely
date for the origin of speech (and hence any form of
language) is the appearance of archaic humans ca 600 ka
[19,24,86,87]. Note that the diaphragm and chest wall move-
ments involved in Duchenne laughter are very different from
those used in speech (the first involves heavy pumping; the
second slow, controlled exhalations [7]).
