While these non-convex constraints do not guarantee globally optimal solutions, we could
show that when we initialized our method with a good linear reconstruction, then the non-
convexly constraint nonlinear reconstructions were often better. However, the improvement also :
comes at the cost of increased computational complexity. For real data, inverting the nonlinear =
model often took hundreds of iterations to achieve the best performance. =

The fact that TV regularization outperforms even our best nonlinear model-based estimate {8
shows the power to the TV constraint for objects with uniform material density as we simulated :
here. It is likely that the inclusion of such a TV regularization term in our nonlinear model aa)
will offer similar benefits, especially when combined with the non-negative matrix factorization Dw
constraint. Using joint constraints has also demonstrated clear benefits.
