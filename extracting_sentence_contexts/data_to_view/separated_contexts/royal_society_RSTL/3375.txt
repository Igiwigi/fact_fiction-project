the interior of each of the larger objects in the germinal vesicle Plate XXIIL fig. 169. c,
presented an appearance fully warranting the section fig. 177 ; though it was not pos-
sible to represent this appearance in that small figure. The seetion fig. 177. is, in
fact, a delineation of one of the objects in the snbstance surrounding the germinal
vesicle in an ovarian ovum of 8} hours. And in no object of the kind sufficiently
adyanced, and the interior of which the eye could reach, have I failed to find traces
of a structure essentially the same (se Plate XXV. figs. 200. 201.).

383, Only a first and second order of discs or incipient cells have been exhibited
in that section (Plate XXIII. fig. 177.), because I wish to figure nothing more than
has been actually seen. But my experience of these objects is such as to warrant the
belief that more orders might have been introduced.
