then occluded or absorbed in the usual way.

By subjecting the results of Troost and HAUTEFEUILLE to a critical analysis, and
from more extended experiments by himself and Roosesoom, Horrsema (‘ Zeitschr.
Physikal. Chem.,’ vol. 17, p. 1, 1895) has arrived at an entirely different conclusion,
namely, that, as regards the vapour pressure experiments, there is no decisive
evidence for the formation of a definite chemical compound ; and he further suggests
that the results are in better agreement with the view that two immiscible solid
solutions are formed. This appears to resolve itself into the formation of two alloys
instead of one, as suggested by GRAHAM.

In confirmation of the arguments of Ho1rseMA against the supposed formation of
a compound having the formula Pd,H, we have also the fact, first observed by
Favre (‘Comptes Rend.,’ vol. 77, p. 649, and vol. 78, p. 1257) and confirmed by
ourselves, that the heat of occlusion of hydrogen by palladium remains constant
throughout the whole range of absorption.

If a chemical compound Pd,H were first formed, we should expect to get a certain
definite evolution of heat per gram of hydrogen combined for the hydrogen first
admitted, and then, after sufficient hydrogen had been added to form the compound
Pd,H (about 630 volumes), we should expect to find a different value for the heat
evolved per gram of hydrogen occluded or dissolved or absorbed. We have,
therefore, confidence in discrediting the supposed formation of Pd,H.

Tt would seem that Horrsema’s conclusions apply equally well to the supposed
