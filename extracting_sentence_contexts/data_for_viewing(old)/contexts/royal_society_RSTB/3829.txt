to attempt to cut sections without decalcification. This I was able to do in
somewhat advanced as well as early tooth germs, in the freezing microtome, after
embedding the specimens in sugar and gum. By using a sharp knife, frequently
renewed, I procured many very thin sections in which. the relations of all the
parts, including the whole enamel organ on the one side, and the dentinal pulp
on the other, are apparently quite undisturbed and give a different aspect in several
particulars from the decalcified sections,



ENAMEL, AND ITS BEARING UPON ENAMEL DEVELOPMENT. 299

One fact which they demonstrate is that although, as in all mammalian tooth germs,
calcification commences in the dentine, it is immediately followed by the laying down
by the enamel organ of a very wide area of imperfectly calcified enamel. A comparison
of fig. 6 in Plate 26 with the appearances of the developing teeth of man and those of
the other orders of the mammalia which I have examined shows that the area occupied
by the forming enamel is many times greater in Macropus. While, therefore, the
process of development in all mammalian enamel is similar, in this, which we may
look upon as a primitive form of the tissue, the enamel is laid down in a fibrillar organic
matrix of very great extent, and calcification is a slower process and ultimately less
complete than in higher enamels, as shown by its penetration by tubes and by the
free staining of the abundant cement substance.

In some of these sections cut without decalcification, the material had previously
