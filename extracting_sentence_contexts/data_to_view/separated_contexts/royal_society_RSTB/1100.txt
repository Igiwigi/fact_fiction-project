= 2, Alterations in Resting Difference,
oO

@The electrical difference between the surface avd cross section of the spinal cord
@ters during observation in the manner already described in treating of the sciatic
rrve and root, but the alterations are much more marked. Ba) Physical Changes.—The effect of drying is the same as in the case of the

nérve, the amount of the resting difference continuing to rise steadily after exposure

aad isolation of the cord unless great care is taken to keep it moist. It is difficult to

ddcertain with precision to what degree this physical change is capable of causing a

re in the difference, this rise being about 0001 Daniell in five minutes; but that it

ig by no means the sole agent is shown by the fact that even when the exposed
rd i is kept moist by steaming sponges with as much care as possible, the rise con-
t®iues, though more slowly than when no such precautions are used, as also by the
fgets to be referred to in the succeeding paragraphs. It is, however, important to

p in view in the consideration of alterations supposed to be due to strictly physio-
Iggical agencies the influence of these purely physical ones.

& (b.) Physiological Changes not obviously Excitatory.--The alterations due to
ysiological changes are associated with both a rise and a fall in the amount of
erence, and are much more marked in the case of the cord than in that of the

wrve or the root. The amount of the rise is demonstrated in the following obser-

ations, in all of which the cord having been exposed, ligatured, and divided, was
suspended by its unattached end and connected with the electrodes in the manner
described before.
