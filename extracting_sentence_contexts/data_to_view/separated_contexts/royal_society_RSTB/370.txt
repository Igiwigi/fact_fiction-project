But the
above considerations made it very desirable to test the ocelli in some other way. I
had long thought of another experiment, in which the head and the body of a larva
were to be exposed respectively to two different colours, producing the most opposite
effects, but the difficulty was in the mode of application. In fact, this difficulty
seemed insuperable for Stages I. and II. of the preparatory period, but perhaps might
be overcome with a little contrivance for Stage ITJ., in which the larva rests suspended. Itâ€™ was, however, first necessary to decide whether the larva is sensitive to colour
during this stage. Previous experiments (V., B.; VI., C.; VIL, B.) had not thrown
much light on the question, but the numbers employed had been insufficient.
