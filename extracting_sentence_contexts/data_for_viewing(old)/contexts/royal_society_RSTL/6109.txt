descends from the Viescherhorner ; but there is another branch which descends from the
Schreckhorn, Finsteraarhorn and Strahleck, and it is to this latter branch that I now
wish to direct attention.

Walking up this glacier from its place of junction with the tributary from the
Viescherhorner, we come at length to the base of an ice-fall which forbids further
advance upon the ice. Let the glacier be here forsaken, and let the flanking mountain
side, either right or left, be ascended, until a pPosition is attained which affords a com-
plete view of the fall and of the glacier stretching downwards from the base of the fall.
The view from such a position will furnish a key to the development of the transverse
structure.

It is, in point of fact, a grand experiment which Nature here swbmits to our inspec-
tion. The glacier, descending from its n6v6, reaches the swmmit of the fall and is
broken transversely as it crosses the brow. It. descends the fall as a succession of
broken cliffy ridges, with transverse hollows between them. In these latter the ice
46bris and the dirt collect, partially choking up the fissures formed in the first instance.
Carrying the eye downwards along the fall, we See, as We approach the base, these sharp
ridges toned down, and a little below the base they dwindle into rounded protuberances
which sweep, in curves, across the glacier. At the centre of the fall there is not a trace
of the true structure to be observed. At the base of the fall it begins to appear,â€”at
tirst feebly, but s0on becomes more pronounced ; until finally, at a short distance below
the fall, the eye can follow the structural groovings right across the surface of the

glacier, while the mass underneath has become correspondingly laminated in the most
