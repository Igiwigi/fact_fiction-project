CONDUCTIVITIES OF METALS AND ALLOYS AT LOW TEMPERATURES. 427

metal there is a hard and a soft state, with different physical properties. If in the
future a still closer agreement between the results obtained by different observers is
demanded, it will be necessary to specify both chemical composition and microscopic
structure of the materials tested.

The fact that the thermal conductivities of most of the pure metals decrease with
increase of temperature, while those of all the alloys tested increase with increase of
temperature, raises the question whether the increase with temperature observed in
the case of aluminium both in JAcER and Dirssenmorstâ€™s experiments and in the
present ones, and in that of nickel in the present experiment, cannot be attributed to
small amounts (less than 1 per cent.) of impurity remaining in the specimens tested.

While there is much to be said in favour of this in the two cases mentioned, it
seems to me that the apparent existence of a maximum of conductivity of silver, and
possibly of steel, and a minimum conductivity of aluminium, shows that we must
guard ourselves against stating that the thermal conductivities of all pure metals
decrease as the temperature rises, and limit ourselves to the less general statement
that the thermal conductivities of most pure metals decrease with rise of temperature
