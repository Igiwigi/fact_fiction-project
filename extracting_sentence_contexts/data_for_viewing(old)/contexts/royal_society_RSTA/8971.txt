not. They may however in the latter case belong to a displaced series, satisfying the
multiple law when the proper displaced limit (yé,)S (0) is employed. This gives us a
method of testing as to what displacement a given line may correspond. If our
calculus were already fully established the next step would be to apply this test to
the above lines. But in reality we are testing our calculus to see if it can be firmly
established, and our immediate aim must be to obtain independent evidence for the
existence of parallel series. For this immediate purpose it will only be necessary to
apply the test to two lines, the general question being postponed for the present.

In the first attempt at arranging the D,, series the strong lines (8) 20559°08 and
(10) 88366°36 were taken for m= 1, 2, and the formula calculated with the limit
D(*%)=8(). As will be seen immediately, this gave satisfactory agreement with
sounded observed lines up to m= 15; and as a matter of fact this series was used ‘to
test for the parallel sets displaced (+2d,)S() on either side of it. Now the formula
constants for a set only vary slightly if the wave-number of the line chosen for m = 1
is changed considerably. This therefore did not prove definitely that 20559 is the
correct Dj, (1), and as a fact it does not satisfy the multiple test. Its mantissa is
897337—3114¢ That of the line 19989, which is shown above to be the origin of the
normal D set is 879853—30°29¢ The difference is 17484 = 2843+71. This is as far

as it can be from being a true multiple, and it is quite impossible to explain this by
any observation errors in the two lines, For instance our maximum admitted error
