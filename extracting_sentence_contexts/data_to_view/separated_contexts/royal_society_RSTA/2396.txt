Therefore, 6 is related to the width of the zeroth autocorrelation peak t, as well as the
width of the first autocorrelation peak. Previous works have extensively studied this drift and its
relation to co-moving Lyapunov exponents [25,57]. The drift is a consequence of the fact that the system is causal. The delayed term x(t — tp)
cannot affect the dynamics before, or even at, the time t. Therefore, in figure 2d, we use

t=nT+o, (3.2)

to create space-time representations, where T = tp + 6 is the recurrence time and now o € [0,T].
