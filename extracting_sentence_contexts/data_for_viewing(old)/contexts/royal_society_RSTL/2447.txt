Some persons may conceive that, in what has been said, I am disparaging too much
the labours of the great mathematicians, NgEwrox, Bernouiii, Laplack and others,
who have employed their skill on this subject. But this opinion cannot, I conceive,
be maintained with justice. It is well known that all the mathematical solutions of
the problem have confessedly gone upon suppositions very remote from the real facts:
Newrox and BerNnouLL, for instance, have assumed the form of the fluid spheroid,
under the influence of the sun and moon, to be the form of equilibrium : LayLace has
supposed the whole globe to be covered with water of an uniform depth. It is in no
degree clear, that investigations conducted on such assumptions will give us eyen an
approximation to the true result; and the only way in which the assumptions could
be justified, would be by our finding, from observation, that the laws of the facts are
Such, or nearly such, as these hypothetical calculations give. If this agreement were

* What is here asserted was strictly true till the publication of Mr. Lunnock's Memoir on the Tides of the
Port of London, and his Tide Tables, founded on his discussion of these. At present his Tide Tables are calcu-
lated by published methods ; but the laws which these methods imply have not yet been compared with theory.

established, it would then, no doubt, become highly probable that the simplifications
hypothetically introduced into the natural state of things were not snch as materially
to alter the general course of the phenomena.
