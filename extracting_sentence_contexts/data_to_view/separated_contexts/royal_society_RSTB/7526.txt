The significance of the carotid rete

Two features of the carotid rete are of especial interest, first, its high degree of develop-
ment in those species of animal in which the internal carotid artery has degenerated, or is
undergoing degeneration, and secondly, its situation along the path of the major vessel
or vessels which supply blood to the brain. It would seem that in those species in which
it is present the carotid rete is of some haemodynamic significance in relation to the
cerebral circulation. The fact that the rete, whether situated intracranially or extra-

cranially, lies within a venous lake is another feature of interest, which probably has
a physiological significance.
