have a small mass ratio. As a consequence, accurate tuning of the natural frequency of the damper
to the natural frequency of the primary structure may become difficult, and small deviations
from the optimal tuning may result in poor control performance. Further, tuning of the damper to
the rotational frequency of the turbine (which is generally associated with harmonic components
that mainly dominate the blade response) is not feasible, as it will lead to instabilities in the
TMD-blade coupled system [14].

More recently, there has been a shift in vibration control strategies from passive to active and
semi-active. Use of active strut elements based on resonant controllers [15] inspired by the concept
of TMDs has been proposed for active control of vibrations in wind turbines. Investigations on
the use of synthetic jet actuators [16], microtabs and trailing edge flaps [17,18] have also been
considered by researchers. Active control strategies have been proposed by Staino et al. [19]
and Fitzgerald et al. [14]. The control hardware takes advantage of the fact that the structure
of the blade is hollow in nature. This allows controllers to be installed inside the blade without
affecting the external aerodynamic characteristic of the blades and hence does not interfere with
aerodynamic performance. By exploiting the space available in the blade, Staino ef al. [19] have
proposed an active tendon controller and Fitzgerald et al. [14] have proposed an active tuned mass
damper (ATMD) for control of the vibration of blades. Control of vibration for variable-speed


rotors has also been proposed by Staino & Basu [20]. A variant of the ATMD has been proposed
by Fitzgerald & Basu [21] to reduce the requirement of the actuator control force in an ATMD. The
controller, termed a cable-connected active tuned mass damper (CCATMD), consists of a classical
ATMD connected to the tip of the blade by a cable.
