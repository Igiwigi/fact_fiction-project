Similarly, the activity of
a number of species of non-swarming Acrididae on a sand-dune in Palestine (Bodenheimer
1935) decreased steadily after reaching a maximum when the soil surface temperature was
about 35Â° C. In consequence, diurnal activity showed a single, midday maximum in spring
and autumn, but two maxima separated by a midday lull in summer. This fact is familiar
to collectors, and was justly emphasized by Rao (1942) in connexion with the estimation of
locust populations in the field. Vol. 235. B. 31
