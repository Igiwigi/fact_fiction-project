(defined as at least 10% of EP and NEP cells swimming or Escherichia coli
spinning) of approximately 75min or more. For the EP
sample, this is probably due to the electric shock inflicted
by electroporation, in terms of either disruption of membrane
integrity, of proton motive force, or both. The fact that some
of the cells in the NEP sample are non-motile immediately
after treatment suggests that, in addition to the effects of elec-
troporation, the washing steps necessary to prepare cells for
electroporation might contribute to such delay, perhaps
breaking the filaments, disrupting the proton motive force
or causing an osmotic shock to the cells owing to the very
low salt concentration used. The observation of rotating cells within minutes of
electroporation indicates that the cell membrane and

Figure 3 shows that viability depends little upon loading
during electroporation. We also assessed the ability of cells
to recover a motile phenotype after electroporation.
