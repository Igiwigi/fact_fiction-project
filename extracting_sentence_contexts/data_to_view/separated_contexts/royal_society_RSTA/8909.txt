ON THE STRESSES IN A NON-UNIFORM RAREFIED MONATOMIC GAS, 31

The ratio of the coefficient of the last term in equation (12.02) to that of the corre-
sponding temperature derivative is 2 zB which is of the order 10>", and is independent

of the degree of rarefaction.* Maxwext was, therefore, justified in neglecting the time
derivatives. Shortly after the appearance of MaAxwe t's paper, Reynoxps published the result
of his investigations into the stresses which must result when heat is communicated from
a surface to a gas.t The object of his researches was to obtain an explanation of the
phenomena of the Radiometer, referred to by him as the “ phenomena of impulsion,”’
and not only did he succeed in so doing, but he was led by a more elaborate treatment
of the problem to a prediction of the phenomena of thermal transpiration.
