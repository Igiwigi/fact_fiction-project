The /;5 are equal to the fictitious forces (36) associated
with ยง,,. /, is the same for (i) and (ii). The representation (ii) fits into normal elastic theory
where surface and body forces are regarded as the sources of the stress field. On the other
hand (i) is a more natural representation of the singularities of physical theory, since they
do not in fact arise from body forces. The requirement of ยง5 that surface tractions should be applied to a free surface of the body
is rather unrealistic. It is certainly not satisfied, for example, when the body containing the
singularity is a specimen in a tensile testing machine.
