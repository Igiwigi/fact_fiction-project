P.R.S. Read February 19, 1801. SIR,

I rave the honour of transmitting to you a' fact relative to arr
elephant's tusk, in which: the iron head -of a spear was lately
discovered to have been imbedded. The tusk weighed fifty pounds: it-measured six feet in length;
and was supposed, by Mr. Pore, an eminent manufacturer at
Birmingham, -to have come from Africa, as he procured it at a
sale in Liverpool.
