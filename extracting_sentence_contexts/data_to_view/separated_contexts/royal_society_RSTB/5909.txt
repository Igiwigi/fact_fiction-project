The trophoblast of these areas is greatly thickened and markedly vacuolated
and is evidently already actively functioning in taking up the secretion of the highly
active uterine glands. In addition to these developing chorionic vesicles, a large
“absorption area,” over which the trophoblast is correspondingly modified, is already
established over the lower pole of the blastocyst in relation to the mucosa covering
the cornual septum (PI. 1, fig. 12, a.a.). It is an interesting fact that the chorionic vesicles of the Lemurs find their closest
parallel in the so-called areole of the allanto-chorion of the Pig, where also the uterine
glands are actively secretory and the trophoblast of the allanto-chorion lies in intimate
apposition with the uterine epithelium. There can be little doubt, I think, that we
are dealing here with homoplastic formations. These absorptive organs of the Lemurs are practically the only specialisations which
are observable in their early ontogeny.
