and thence the generating function, which enumerates all partitions at the nodes of
the complete lattice, which are such that each has one or more parts at least as great
as /+1, is

+a7(L—e+2)..(I=ye-tann)

and it is easy to verify that this expression added to the expression already found for
GF (J, m, n) is, in fact, equal-to

L+,4+...+L,

that is, to GF («, m, 7).

Art. 15. This main proposition involves the whole theory of the partitions at the
nodes of an incomplete lattice; it gives the true generating function without
redundant terms, and this only needs examination and, where possible, simplification.
Such simplification is apparently always possible when the lattice is complete.
Moreover, there is the task of exhibiting L( ; a, a, a3, ...) a8 a product of outer and
inner lattice functions and of finding the algebraic expression of L,( ; a, ds, ds, ...).
