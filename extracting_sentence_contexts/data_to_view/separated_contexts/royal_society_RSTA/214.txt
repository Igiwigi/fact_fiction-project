The article by Jones & Simonsen [2] discusses the ramifications of the
orograms as data concept and considers general desirable features o
models of computation. It discusses a recently proposed model, motivatec
ny biology, the ‘blob’ model, and to what extent it meets these ideal
features and how the remaining desiderata could be addressed. The article by Marion [3] is motivated by applications of Kleene’s seconc
recursion theorem, which is the key mathematical fact expressing the
yower of the program-as-data concept, to modelling computer viruses. The key features of viruses are self-replication and mutation. The paper
discusses a concrete computational model of these features in the form o
self-modifying register machines.
