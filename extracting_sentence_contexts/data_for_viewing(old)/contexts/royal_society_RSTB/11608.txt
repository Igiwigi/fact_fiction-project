Figure 2. The results of the hierarchical clustering dendrogram using scores derived from the first eight axes of the MCA. Clusters were determined by finding the
optimum level of inertia gain (p < 0.05).

Table 1. The cosine squared (cos’) scores for the most important variables used to characterize the first two axes (dimension 1 and dimension 2) of the MCA
with variables close to one are best represented by the two dimensions. Also shown is the percentage (%) contribution of the yes/no assignments for each
category.
