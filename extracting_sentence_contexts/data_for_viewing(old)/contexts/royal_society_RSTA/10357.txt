It has been found experimentally that the rays from the different radioactive
products differ in penetrating power, and the curve of absorption for different thick-
nesses of absorbing material is, in general, a characteristic of each product.

The identity of the curves of absorption of the @ rays from the active bismuth
and the radio-tellurium, coupled with the similarity of the radiations and chemical
properties, is very strong evidence that the active product is in each case the same.
I think there can be little doubt that the active constituent of radio-tellurium of
MARcKWALD is a disintegration product of radium.

The polonium (radioactive bismuth) obtained by me from Paris loses its activity
fairly rapidly, and the @ rays from it are more readily absorbed than the « rays of
radio-tellurium. ‘This greater absorption may, however, be due in part to the fact
that the radiations from the polonium come from the mass of the bismuth, and in
consequence are made up of rays of widely different penetrating power, while the
rays from the radio-tellurium arise from a thin film of matter deposited on the
bismuth plate, in whieh the absorption of the issuing rays would be small. The
identity or otherwise of the constituent present in the polonium of Mme. Curte and
the radio-tellurium of MarckwaLp has been a much vexed question. A definite
answer cannot be given until accurate observations have been made of the change of
activity with time of these products.

25. Radioactivity observed in Ordinary Matter.—A large number of experimenters
have observed that ordinary matter possesses the property of radioactivity to a
feeble degree. KR. J. Srrurr found that different samples of the same metal showed
