Q ProFeS80R Casgy communicated to me the MS. of the foregoing Memoir, and he has
D permitted me to make to it the present Addition, containing further deyelopments on
E the theory of the bicircular quartic,

Sy Starting from his theory of the fourfold generation of the curve, Prof. Casey shows
£ that there exist series of inscribed quadrilaterals ABCD whereof the sides AB, BC,
=) CD, DA pass through the centres of the four circles of inversion respectively ; or (as it
S is convenient to express it) the pairs of points (A, B), (B, C), (GC, D), (D, A) belong to
= the four modes of generation respectively, and may be regarded as depending upon
=] certain parameters (his 6, 9, 6", 5”, or 82y) @,, @,, 0z, @ respectively, any three of these being
Z in fact functions of the fourth. Considering a given quadrilateral ABCD, and giving
= to it an infinitesimal variation, we have four infinitesimal ares AA', BB', CC', DD;
'S these are differential expressions, AA' and BB' of the form Mid,, BB' and CC' of the
2 form M,dw,, CC' and DD' of the form M,ds,, DD' and AA' of the form Md; or, what
S is the same thing, AA' is expressible in the two forms Md» and M,de,, BB' in the two
J forms Md and Myde,, &c., the identity of the two expressions for the same arc of
i course depending on the relation between the two parameters. But any such monomial
£ expression Md of an arc AA' would be of a complicated form, not obviously reducible
£ to elliptic functions; Casey does not obtain these monomial expressions at all, but he finds
SZ geometrically monomial expressions for the differences and sum BB'—AA', CC'—BB,,
5 DD'+CC', DD'—AA' (they cannot be all of them differences), and thence a quadrinomial
expression AA'=N,da, + Nadu, +N,du,+Nde (his ds'=ed9+&d9% +2d6" +8" d6"); and
5 that without any explicit consideration of the relations which connect the parameters.
