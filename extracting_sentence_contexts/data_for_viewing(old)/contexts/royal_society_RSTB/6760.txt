Mo.uusca OF THE Gaza Beps, LAKE RUDOLF

The recent molluscan fauna of Lake Rudolf is essentially of nilotic type, and there
can be no doubt that in time past the lake was connected with the Nile system. From
the geological evidence of the lake beaches and their associated human cultures it is
known that the present fauna has occupied the lake basin since early Middle Pleisto-
cene times, but that prior to its appearance there was an earlier molluscan fauna more

nearly related to species known only from the Central African Province. In fact I
believe that they represent a northern extension of the extinct Kaiso fauna of Uganda.

Elsewhere (Fuchs 1936) I have suggested that the molluscan fauna of the Kaiso
beds may be ancestrally related to the peculiar modern fauna of Lake Tanganyika.
The three species of mollusca known from the Gaza waterhole deposit are all known
from the Kaiso Beds of the Lake Edward-Lake Albert region, but have not been found
jn situ in any of the later Lake Rudolf beaches. I would therefore suggest that the Gaza
specimens are representatives of a fauna once widespread in Africa, which locally
produced exotic types, but which in Lake Rudolf may have been too soon exterminated
for that to have occurred.
