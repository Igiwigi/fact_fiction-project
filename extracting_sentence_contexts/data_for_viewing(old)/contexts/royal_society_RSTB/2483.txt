POTASH IN WHEAT SOILS OF BROADBALK FIELD, ROTHAMSTED. 261

Tf we take the figures of the last tables, in which throughout the figures of the
unmanured plot No. 3 are deducted, so as to show only the excess found, it will be
seen that in the 1865 samples the first 9 inches of soil showed that from 35 to 39
of the caleulated total excess of phosphoric acid existed therein in the citric-acid-
soluble form. In the 1881 samples the proportion of calculated excess so found
was from 32 to 40 per cent., and in 1893 from 31 to 36 per cent. for the corre-
sponding plots, and 48 and 50 per cent. for the two other plots not sampled in the
earlier years.

In the second depths of 9 inches, however, at none of the periods do we find more
eitric-acid-soluble phosphoric acid than in the totally unmanured Plot 3. In fact, we
find actually less in every instance but one.

In the third depths, too, there is a slight excess, on the whole, in the 1865
samples ; and in the 1893 samples an excess only in three cases, and in only two of
these is the excess a fairly tangible one.

Now it has already been seen that there is reason to suppose that there has been
a descent of manurial phosphoric acid below the first 9 inches. Why is practically
none of it found there, in four at least of the six plots, in a citric-soluble condition ?
And, further, why is there on the other hand, notwithstanding the downward trans-
mission of phosphates, an actual deficiency of phosphoric acid in a presumably
available condition? The explanation that suggests itself is, that while much of such
