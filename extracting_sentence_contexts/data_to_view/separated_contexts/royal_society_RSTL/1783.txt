towards that part where,
from contact of the vessel or other cause, they meet with no
counter currents ta oppose them. In what manner the crust
acts is however still a little obscure : in all probability it forms
a Voltaic combination with the mercury and the liquid.

48. In reasoning upon the facts detailed in this Paper, we
have to consider, as probably materially influencing the re-
sults, first, the vast difference of conducting power between the
metallic bodies set in motion, and the liquid under which they
are immersed. This is not unlikely to enter as one of the
essential conditions of the phenomenon, especially as it ap-
pears to result from all the experiments, that the peculiar
action, whatever it be, by which the currents are produced,
is exerted only at the common surface of the fluids. I have
never been able to produce the least trace of such currents
without the presence of a fluid metal.
