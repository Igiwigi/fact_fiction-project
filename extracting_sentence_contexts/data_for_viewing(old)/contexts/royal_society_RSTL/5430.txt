178 PROFESSOR GRAHAM ON OSMOTIC FORCE.

tity of salt leaves the phial by diffusion. This quantity was reduced to one-half when
the strong and thick membrane of the ox-gullet was used to coyer the mouth of the
phial; and it was not affected in a sensible degree by passing through a thinner mem-
brane, consisting of ox-bladder with the outer muscular coat removed. In the last
experiment the actual diffusates were 0631 gramme common salt in the absence of
the membrane, and 0'636 gramme common salt with the membrane interposed, which
may be considered as the same quantity, The diffusion of a salt appears to take
place, therefore, without difficulty or loss through the substance of a thin membrane,
although the mechanical flow of a liquid may be nearly stopped by such an obstacle.

It is well to bear in mind the last fact in the consideration of what is seen in an
endosmotic experiment. An open glass tube, with one end expanded into a bell form
and covered by tight membrane, forms a vessel which may be filled with a saline solu-
tion and immersed in a jar of pure water. The volume of liquid in this osmometer
s20n begins to increase and is observed to rise in the tube, while the simultaneous
appearance of salt in the water of the jar may easily be verified. M. DuTrocuer de-
scribed the result as the movement of two unequal streams through the membrane
in opposite directions, the smaller stream being that of the saline solution flowing
outwards, and the larger that of pure water flowing inwards. The double current
has been always puzzling, but the expression of the fact becomes more conceivable
when we say (as we may do truly) that the molecules of the salt travel outwards by
diffusion through the porous membrane. It is not the whole saline liquid which
moves outwards, but merely the molecules of salt, their water of solution being
