There are a few cases in which there would appear to be a light divergence,
but these are in hydrated xalts, and the reason is easily found. The following table
gives the differences :—

The total difference between the extremes of the three inorganic acids is an average

The difference between chloride ana bromide in the potassium salts is 26", and
between bromide and iodide 2:5”; the total difference between the chloride and
iodide in both potassium and sodium salts being 5:1”. Two facts are brought out by
these numbers : first, that the bodies containing the greatess amount of energy offer
the least resistance in the tube—for instance, nitrates all flow fastest, and sulphates,
which are fully exhausted compounds, flow slowes ; the second fact is that the greater
the mass the les resistance does it, offer. We ee this in the cases of the chlorides,
bromides, and iodides, the last having the highest combining weight, and hence the
greatest chemical mass, flow much easier than either of the others. Let us now
examine the metals.
