common rate coefficient for many molecular ions. But this was not the end of the story,
not even the beginning of the end; it marked only the end of the beginning. The story I
will tell in this article started about 10 years ago, when the dissociative recombination
of Hy was approaching its deepest crisis. Today, owing to an extensive experimental and
theoretical effort, the state of affairs has reached a historically unique level of harmony,
although there still remains many things to sort out.

1. Introduction

This 10 years retrospective on the dissociative recombination of Hy is of course
related to the fact that the first Royal Society Discussion Meeting (RSDM) on H}
was held in the year 2000, i.e. just over 10 years ago. At that time, which is very
clear from a reading of my summary of the situation concerning experimental
and, to some extent, theoretical studies of the dissociative recombination of
Hy [1], the situation was bewildering. The reaction itself appears, naively,

to be very simple:
H} +e >H+H+Hor Hy) +H. (1.1)

Only three protons and three electrons, of which one electron is free before
the reaction and all electrons are bound after the reaction, at the expense of
a complete or partial break-up of a stable molecular ion.
