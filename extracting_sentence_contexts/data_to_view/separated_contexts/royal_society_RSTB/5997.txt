W. BARRINGTON ON THE SEGMENTATION

phases of the development of the earlier somites.‚Äù Thus it is clear that the prootic
somites of the bird, in failing to pass through the typical early stages of normal somites,
are merely carrying to an extreme a phenomenon already manifested in the posterior
trunk region. Moreover, in addition to the facts that the extrinsic eye-muscles are striated, voluntary,
and innervated by ventral nerve-roots, like the myotomes of the trunk, there are
certain facts which speak directly for the somitic nature of these eye-muscle rudiments. The ramus recurrens of the abducens nerve, with its series of small roots which appear
to unite the abducens and the metotic roots into a continuous series, has been described
above (of., p. 418). This structure, described by Miss Piarr and others in Selachians
(Piarr, 1891), and especially by BeLogotowy (1908) in the chick, is of the greatest
importance in relating the abducens to the ventral root series and its muscle to the
myotomes innervated by those ventral roots.
