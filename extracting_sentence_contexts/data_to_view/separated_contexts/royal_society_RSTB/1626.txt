an considering, from a physiological point of view, the significance of the structural
Bilifications presented by the air-bladder and its adjuncts in this section of the
Baily, we may, in the first place, briefly capitulate certain anatomical facts already
ig@utioned in a previous section of this paper. gApart from a very considerable reduction, both in absolute and relative size, the
a@sence of lateral chambers and the persistence of the anterior chamber only, the most
wteworthy features in the air-bladder of the various genera of Siluridse abnovmales
aze—its constriction, partial or complete, into two laterally-situated nir-sacs, which may
ngt only lose all connection with each other, but with the esophagus also; the
tendency of the air-sues to become more or less completely enclosed within variously-
famed hony capsules; the occasional atrophy of the ductus pneumaticus, or its persis-
ce asa solid fibrous cord ; aud frequently also, in addition, the more or less complete
ply of the fibres which normally form the dorsal walls of lateral halves of the
Fldlder, und connect the lateral walls with the crescentic processes of the tripodes. To these may be added the partial solidification of the organ in certain species, either
through the thickening and matting together of its walls, or the development of
intsrnal fibrous trabecule, or through the partial obliteration of ils cavity through
the growth of a thick central column of fibres.
