« Let r denote the weight of adhesive air dragged by one inch of the rod

* (equal, in the present cases, to _ of the whole quantity dragged by these

* rods as found in the 13th set of experiments) ; and let us suppose that any
* one rod begins at @ inches from the axis of motion, and ends at y inches
« from the same axis: then will the effect of the air adhering to that rod be

© represented by J (4* — a®). This is the same as if the whole quantity of

«air, »(y — 2), had been attached at the distance \ LES ;
