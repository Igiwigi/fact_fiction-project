Also a description of
a Five-feet Equatorial Instrument employed in the observations. By Joun FREDERICK WILLIAM HERSCHEL, Esq. F. R. S. and
James SouTn, Esq. F. R. S.

Read January 15, 1824. Tux frequent and exact determination of the apparent dis-
tances and positions of such double stars, as are sufficiently
close to be easily measured with micrometers and high mag-
nifying powers, was suggested by Sir WiLLI1aM HERSCHEL,
more than forty years ago, as an enquiry likely to lead to
interesting results, and which has, in fact, in his hands, led
to the creation of a new department of physical astronomy,
and to the discovery of a class of phanomena in the sidereal
heavens referable to the agency of attractive forces, and
analogous to those produced by gravity within the limits of
our own system. The immediate object with which the en-
quiry was commenced, the determination of the existence and
amount of annual parallax, was soon lost sight of in the more
extensive views of the construction of the universe which
unfolded themselves as it advanced, and has not since been
resumed ; though, from the extreme precision of which it will
appear in the course of this paper such measurements are
susceptible, owing to the refinements of modern instrument-
making (a precision not to be looked for in any other class

2 Mr. HERSCHEL's and Mr. SouTH's observations of the apparent

of celestial observations) and the progress we may yet hope
for from farther improvements in this respect, there is every
reason to suppose it still the most eligible mode of setting at
rest that great question, and to believe that no distant period
must put us in possession of something decisive from this
quarter, as to the existence or non-existence of an appreciable
amount of that element.
