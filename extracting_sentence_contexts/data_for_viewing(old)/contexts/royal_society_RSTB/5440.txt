walls of which are pierced by the aqueeductus cochlew and the fenestra rotunda. This
hindmost part of the cavum cochleare is at a lower level than the cavum vestibulare,
and is slightly marked off from it by a ridge projecting from the median wall which is
continued backwards into the floor of the hindmost part of the canalicular capsule and
which forms the roof of the aqueeductus cochles. Anteriorly, the cavum cochleare is
partly obstructed by a spiral septum. This septum is attached to the foremost point
of the crista falciformis, and sweeps downwards, outwards and forwards to the floor of

the cochlear capsule. The septum separates the first turn of the ductus cochlearis from
the second, and it also marks the division between the front of the cavum vestibulare
(which lies above it) and the cavum cochleare (which lies median and anterior to it).
The cavum canaliculare is freely continuous with the cavum vestibulare in front ;
in fact the anterior part of the cavum canaliculare may be said to have no floor.
This part is expanded to form the recessus utriculo-ampullaris anterior and lateralis,
into which open the anterior and lateral semicircular canals respectively. The floor of
the posterior part of the cavum canaliculare has already been mentioned as forming
a shelf which projects forwards over the cavum perilymphaticum and the aqueeductus
cochlew, and its under surface (which forms the prominentia utriculo-ampullaris
