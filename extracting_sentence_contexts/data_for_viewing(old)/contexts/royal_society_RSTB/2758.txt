O. ammon, and O, canadensis show that these sheep in their wild state have a definite
annual sexual season, which from its short duration renders it probable that they are
moneestrous. ‘Thus the sexual season in Ovis canadensis (var. typica) is described as

* According to BEARD, just under ten ovulation intervals go to the sheep’s gestation.

+ An experienced breeder of Angus and Shorthorn cattle in Banffshire, in answer to a query regarding
the length of the dicstrous cycle in cows of those breeds, states that this interval varies from two to
three weeks.

{ Scorr, writing on “The Practice of Sheep Farming,” states that with hill sheep generally, the
“tupping season” (i.¢., the sexual season) begins about November 22, and terminates with the close of
the year, and that the lambing season begins about April 17 and ends about May 26. These facts
render it improbable that there are usually more than two dicestrous cycles with hill sheep, but it must
be remembered that, if there are a sufficient number of rams to a flock of a given size, the ewes usually
succeed in getting served at an early cestrus.

§ Professor Ewart informs me that the duration of the sexual season (or the number of dicestrous
eycles in a season) with horses varies according to the character of the breed. Thus, in semi-wild ponies
(¢.g-, Ieeland or Exmoor ponies) the sexual season terminates with the approach of autumn, In the more
domestic types of horses, cestrus may continue to recur for a far longer period.
