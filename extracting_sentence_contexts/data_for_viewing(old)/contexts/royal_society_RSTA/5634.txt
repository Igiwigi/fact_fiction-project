Combining the result of the Lemma above with the expression of the Laplacian in geodesic
coordinate (2.3c) to compute Ax((u" (x) - n(x))?) and Ay@y in the right-hand side of (3.15), equation
(3.15) yields the following basic formula for our purpose:

ols)
i

- (c2oP" + 2(d6@p)(sP") + rad) . (3.20)

—AP! = ( (jm . 7) + 2a6d9 (" (u - i) + JBM = a (j mw" . i)

Remark 3.8. It is important to underline the fact that by the specific choice of P”, there are no
terms involving the second-order derivative with respect to s of u” and P” on the right-hand side
of the formula (3.20).

The first consequence of formula (3.20), and the aforementioned remark, is the uniform (with
respect to 7 and «) continuity of the function asP}, which is the objective of the following ‘trace’:

Proposition 3.9. The function asP} is given by an equation of the following form:

asP}(s, )=ANs,-)+ | 2"s',-) ds’, (3.21)
