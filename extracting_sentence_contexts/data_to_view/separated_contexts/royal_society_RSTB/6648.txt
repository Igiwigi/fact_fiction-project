The nature of the deposits, indeed, mainly lake mud oligotrophic Sphagnum peat and
calcareous mere silt, would suggest in themselves the greatest freedom from the in-
fluence of local sources of tree pollen. If these interpretations are correct we are faced with the fact that a very large part
of the variations of the curves of pollen diagrams from fens may be due to the influence
of local woods growing on the peat surface or near by, and to changes in the relative
importance of such local factors upon the regional pollen rain. TRUNDLE MERE- B. 1936 sutface lem eypmx 3S fe.0.0. Crobm)
