(b.) The shape and mode of growth of the chambers succeeding the megalosphe
and microsphere. ScHLUMBERGER has called attention to the very interesting fact, that in many
species among the Miliolidee the chambers immediately succeeding the central one
are arranged on the biloculine plan in the megalospheric form, and on the quinquelo-
culine plan in the microspheric form (woodcut, p. 405.) In several species the second chamber of the megalospheric form is peculiar. Thus,
in Orbitolites, it forms the large circumambient chamber (CARPENTER) which almost
surrounds the primordial chamber (megalosphere); in Cycloclypeus the second
chamber has a similar relation to the megalosphere.
