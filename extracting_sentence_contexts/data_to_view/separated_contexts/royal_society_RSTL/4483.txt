With iodine this will not take place. The decomposition of the chloride of silyer by the peroxide of barium is a true
link between these experiments with iodine and the reduction of the metallic oxides. In whatever rational form we may express these facts, the facts themselves are the
8ame. We cannot see the mode in which the action is effected, nor for the present
argument is it at all important whether we consider, as we reasonably may, that the

change takes place* by the decomposition of water, and that the oxygen which is
formed is the result of the combination of the element of the water with the element
of the peroxide, or whether we consider the jodine to be transferred directly to the
barium, and the whole of the oxygen to come from the peroxide itself. Whatever
theory accounts for this reaction, the same theory, I will yenture to assert, will ex-
plain the decomposition of the metallic oxides.
