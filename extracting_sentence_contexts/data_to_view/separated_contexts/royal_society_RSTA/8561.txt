which depend on extrapolation beyond the range of the experimental data are printed
in italies. From Table V., and from the graphical representation of fig. 4, the following con-
clusions may be drawn :—

(1) The reversal of sign (which has been observed hitherto only in the anhydrous
acid, in alcoholic and in super-saturated aqueous solutions or in the ultra-
violet region of the spectrum) is here recorded with the help of the camera, in
the extreme violet region of the spectrum in unsaturated aqueous solutions
containing only 50 grams of tartaric acid in 100 c.c. of the solution (e = 0°5875
or P = 41-25 per cent.).

(2) The maximum rotation, which has usually been said to vanish on dilution, is here
retained on the less refrangible side of the violet mercury line even at a con-
centration of only 5 grams per 100 c.c. This fact is of interest in connection
with the statement of ARNDTSEN that at concentrations below 20 per cent. by
weight ‘the dispersion becomes normal in so far as the angle of rotation
increases continuously with the refrangibility of the light; yet the rotation
increases so little from the ray F to the ray e, that one cannot doubt that it
would have a maximum in the violet part of the spectrum” (‘ Ann. Chim. Phys.,’ 1858, vol. 54, p. 412).
