coincided with the beginning of the forestroke of the limb in front of which the dye
had been injected. If I had done so, Srorcu could not have brought this argument
against me.

I have now pointed out the two main differences between Storcu’s views and my own.
Firstly, the nature of the movement of the third and fourth trunk limbs of Daphnia.

This would be a matter of detail were it not for the fact that Srorcu in his investigation
of other Branchiopoda assumes that all filtratory limbs move in the same way as those of
Daphnia. Now if Srorc with his elaborate cinematographic apparatus would
photograph a Daphnid on its back and focus, not on the edges of the third and fourth
trunk limbs, but on the floor of the food groove, I am convinced that he would always
obtain a clear image. This would be a critical experiment as a camera has no * after
image,” so that, if at any instant the third limbs came together in the middle line, this
would obscure the food groove and it would be recorded on the photograph.

The second difference is as to whether or not an anterior food current exists along the
food groove of the Branchiopoda. The results of my experiment on Chirocephalus
satisfy me and I consider that before disputing the existence of this current, SroRcH
should at least attempt to repeat my experiment.
