To observe peering links, several groups (e.g. CAIDA,> RIPE® and DIMES’ [4]) have “3
used tools such as Traceroute [5], which sends a stream of packets to a single destination from a : a
single observation point, with each successive packet reporting the address it has reached after ig
an increasing number of hops. As long as the packets all follow the same path, this traces the : s
actual links along which the message has been routed, and peering links are in fact observed. :&
The effectiveness of Traceroute observations is difficult to quantify (how to count the links not 2

seen?), but it clearly depends both on the completeness of the set of destinations to which traces
are sent and on the richness and coverage achieved by the observation points from which they are
sent. Solutions to the first problem have been worked out by groups from CAIDA, DIMES and
RIPE in the past, but establishing and maintaining enough points from which to see deep into the

Internet remains the bigger problem, which we will discuss below. A curious difference between : =
Traceroute-based discovery of the links in the Internet and identifying links by collecting the : yy
routes advertised by BGP routers is that the two methods appear to discover different sets of links. (3
In the DIMES studies, Traceroute from several thousand downloaded software clients discovered : S
fewer ASes and fewer links overall than the BGP data collected by the RouteViews project.® It 22

DIMES increased the total number of links seen (in either direction) by about 30%.
