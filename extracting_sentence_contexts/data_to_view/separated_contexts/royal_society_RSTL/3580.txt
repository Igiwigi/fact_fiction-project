Received June 17,—Read June 17, 1841. NoTWITHSTANDING the great length of time during which the blood has been
the subject of physiological research, an eminent anatomist, s0 late as the year 1838,
* remarks, that © we have no clear conception of the mode in which the floating cor-
puscles of the blood conduce to nourishment-.” That Professor WEBER was not
mistaken in coming to such a conclusion, I think will be admitted by every one who
takes the pains to consult the records of discovery in this most interesting field of
observation. I am not aware that, since the period just mentioned, any additional facts have
been published, relating to © the mode in which the floating corpuscles of the blood
conduce to nourishment,” unless my own communications, already presented to the
Society, are to be 80 regarded, —those communications having reference to the mode
of propagation of the floating blood-corpuscle, and to its conversion into two or three
kinds of tissnes. The object of the present memoir is to bring together a large number of obserya-
tions, made by myself, showing that every structure I have examined arises out, of
corpuscles having the same appearance as corpuscles of the blood. I may here
mention, that the tissues submitted to actual observation, with the result just men-
tioned, will be found to include the cellular, nervous, and muscular ; besides carti-
lage, the coats of blood-vessels, several membranes, the tables, cells, and cylinders of
the epithelium, the pigmentum nigrum, the ciliary processes, the crystalline lens itself,
and even the spermatozoon and the ovum.
