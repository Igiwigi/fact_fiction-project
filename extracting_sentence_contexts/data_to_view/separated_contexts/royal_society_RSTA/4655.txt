It may be that with
more tin than SnCu,, the liquid alloy breaks up into two conjugate liquids, and
that this state exists until more than 25 atoms of tin are present. If this were so,
we should have expected, as in the copper-lead curve, that this part would have been
horizontal ; but, assuming the two conjugates to differ little in density, the slight,
but real, slope in this part of the curve might be accounted for by imperfect realiza-
tion of equilibrium at the freezing point. The interesting complete cooling curves of copper-tin alloys given by Professor
Roserts-Austen, in his Report on Alloys, will, we think, be found to be consistent
with the facts observed by us, although we should not perhaps altogether agree with
him in the inferences that can be drawn from these facts. The Silver-Antimony Curve. (Fig. 11.)
