Under
this condition the pulmonary vein carries purely arterial blood to the heart, where it is
mixed with venous blood and distributed to the various organs of the body. If the
medium in which the fish happens to be is perfectly unfit for breathing, the gills cease
to have any function ; if only in a less degree, the gills may still continue to assist in
respiration. Ceratodus, in fact, can breathe by either gills or lungs alone, or by both
sImultaneously. It is not, probable that this fish lives freely out of the water, the limbs being much
too flexible for supporting the heavy and unwieldy body, and too feeble generally to be
of much use in locomotion on land. However, it is quite possible that it is occasionally
compelled to leave the water, although I do not believe that it can exist without it in a
lively condition for any length of time.
