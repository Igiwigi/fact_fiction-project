Now imagine the
temperature to be raised. We must assume that, as the intensity of vibration in-
creases, other periods come into play which rapidly increase in intensity, while those
which were prominent ab first gradually disappear, 80 that, after a while, a different
eb of vibrations is formed. I do not know that there is any fact which could be
adduced against s&nch an explanation, nor do I think that the explanation is theo-
retically impossible. Yet the passage of one line spectrum into the other regembles 80
very closely the passage of a band spectrum into that of a line spectrum, that one feels
inclined to refer both phenomena to the game cause. In the case of oxygen, for
instance, one line spectrum appears under precisely the same cireumstances as the
band spectrum of nitrogen, and it changes into the other line spectrum almost identi-
cally in the 8ame way as the band spectrum of nitrogen changes into the line spectrum.
