By Sir Humenry Davy, Bart. P. R. S.

Read July 5, 1821. £ Is my letter to Dr. WoLLasToxn' on the new facts dis-
covered by M. OxrsTED, which the Society has done me. the
honour to publish, I mentioned, that I was not able: to. render
a bar of steel magnetic by transmitting the electrical dis-
charge across it through a tube filled with sulphuric acid ; and
I have likewise mentioned, that the electrical discharge passed
across a piece of steel through air, rendered it less magnetic
than when passed through a metallic wire; and I attributed
the first cireumstance to the sulphuric: acid being too bad a
conductor to transmit a sufficient quantity of electricity for
the effect ; and the second, to the electricity passing through
air in a more diffused state: than through metals.
