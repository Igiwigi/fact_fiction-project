17 and 18: 8, 9, 10); and each differentiates normally, as in
Angiosperm floral development, into an anther-head to which later a filament region is
added (fig. 18: 10, 11). There is not the slightest evidence for regarding the
andreecium as represented by two members (the primordial cushions) producing three
sori; or, for example, for calling it two lateral members each throwing off three
pinnules which are antheriferous segments of a compound sporophyll. The simple
statement that a segmented andreecial region of the axis gives rise to one whorl of
identically equal and normally constructed stamens most clearly expresses all the
facts available. During the differentiation of the andreecium, the prophylls extend,
and soon nearly enclose the greater part of the bud: the posterior perianth-segment
overlaps the anterior at the margin and tip; the collar of the gyncecial cone extends,
and delimits a distinct stalked terminal ovule (fig. 17 : 8, bud 0°68 mm. high; 9, bud
0°76 mm. high).
