additional ones). Similarly, we underline that the aforementioned fitting procedure only relies on
the fitting of the dispersion curves at 0° and 45°, since, given the tetragonal symmetry class of
the constitutive tensors used, these two independent directions are sufficient to determine all the
parameters and automatically cover all the other directions. These properties (self-given fitting of
the imaginary part and of the intermediate directions) give further standing to our modelling
approach, since, to the authors’ knowledge, no model correctly describing metamaterials’
behaviours for all possible directions and for a wide range of frequencies can be found in the
literature.

Finally, we remark that figure 2 also explicitly indicates a pressure /shear decomposition of the
propagating relaxed micromorphic waves. This decomposition is obtained by writing equation
(2.3) in a reference system aligned with the direction of propagation considered (0° and 45°,
respectively). In fact, given the correct choice of the reference system, equation (2.3) give rise
to two sets of uncoupled PDEs that can be interpreted as pressure and shear waves. Given
the chosen class of symmetry (tetragonal), this uncoupling is only possible for the 0° and 45°
direction, while waves are coupled when considering intermediate directions. This means that
an analogous distinction between shear and pressure waves cannot be done for intermediate
directions.

3. Design of an acoustic shield

We present here a comparison between the finite-element modelling of the response of a structure
(figure 3) built out from the metamaterial composed from the unit cell in figure 1 and the
same structure made up of its homogeneous equivalent relaxed micromorphic continuum whose
parameters are reported in table 1. We consider different values of the frequency and of the
