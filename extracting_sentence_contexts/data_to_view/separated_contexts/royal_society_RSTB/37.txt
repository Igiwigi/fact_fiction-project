beds of Swanage, Dorsetshire.* An examination of this solitary lower jaw shows
what is, considering the immense antiquity of the species, rather a startling fact,
namely, that it had an absolutely identical tooth-change to that found in modern
Marsupials. This fact is shown most clearly by the typical specimen, which happens
fortunately to be in precisely the right condition to show it, namely, with the milk-
premolar still in its place in the jaw, while the permanent pm‘ is clearly visible buried
in the bone beneath (see Plate 27, fig. 10). The milk-premolar is not small and
nearly functionless, as it is in Phascologale, but is nearly as large as, and is very
similar in shape to, the first molar standing just behind it. This ancient and remark-
able fossil gives us, therefore, the one stage earlier than the abnormal Phascologale
above described, having, on the presumption that its upper jaw resembled its lower,
1.2.3.4
1.2.3.4
the fourth one with a large and functional milk predecessor.t

We may now consider this history of the evolution of the premolars of the
Dasyuridee as fairly proved, and may represent it diagrammatically as follows :—
