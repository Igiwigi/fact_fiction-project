Between 256* C. and 284* OC. the mass simply absorbed heat without undergoing
either contraction or expansion. At 284* C. it began to contract, and between that temperature and 309* C. it under-
went slight contraction under a negative coefficient of

-00003999,

At 309* C. the contraction ceased and the mass simply absorbed heat without either
contracting or expanding, till a temperature of 319* C. had been attained, ab which
point rapid expansion eb in under a coefficient of

00016665
which is more than three times greater than the coefficient of expansion between 0*
and 223* C. C.

S The fact that the alloy does not commence to expand again after its phase of con-
Straction till a temperature of 324 C. has been attained, necessitated the raising of the
Zemperature to an _unusnal height. The ceresine employed for heating, ignites when
