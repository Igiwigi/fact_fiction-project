Upon sub-
jecting phosphoric acid, fused upon the ring end of a wire (401.), to the action of the
voltaic apparatus, it conducted, and was decomposed ; but gas, which I believe to be
hydrogen, was always eyolyed at the negative electrode, and the wire was not affected
as would haye happened had phosphorus been separated. Gas was also eyolved at
the positive electrode. From all the facts, I conclude it was the water and not the
acid which was decomposed. 683. Arsenic acid.
