main trunk of a tree twenty-seven years of age, growing under natural conditions. Open wounds
are indicated by blackened areas. No. 1, 1 growth ring ; No. 2, 2 growth rings ; No. 3, 4 growth rings ;
No.4, 10 growth rings ; No. 5, 17 growth rings ; No. 6, 22 growth rings.

years’ growth respectively. The presence of numerous resin canals in these provides an
interesting contrast to the condition in similar regions of very young plants. In fact,
the lower part of this same plant, where there are twenty-seven growth rings, shows an
entire lack of canals in the first few years’ growth. Photos. 65 and 66 (Plate 13) illus-
trate sections from the same region as the drawing. The distribution of the canals here
is such that they might be considered normal were it not for the presence of the false
rings, clearly seen in the photographs.

In No. 5 a severe wound of open type is shown, with the overgrowth features in the
year in which it was inflicted as well as in the two succeeding years. The wound area
has been blackened in this case to show its extent and the two black areas farther in are
faults left by similar wounds. The immediate response to the large wound is shown
by the extensive tangential series, continuous from one edge of the wound to the other.
Later in the year of wounding it formed short series on either side—four in all, in one
