carried towards, and into, the roots; where it preserves life,
and occasions some degree of growth to take place. But a
small portion of that fluid will be carried upwards by capillary
attraction, between the bark and the alburnum, exclusive of
the immediate action of the latter substance, and the whole
of this will stagnate on the lower lip of the wound ; where I
conceive it generates the small portion of wood and bark,
which Hares and Du Hamtr have described.

I should scarely have thought an account of the pr-ceding
experiments worth sending to you, but that many of the
conclusions I have drawn/in former memoirs appear, at first
view, almost incompatible with the facts stated by HaLes and

sap of resinous trees, which appeared to lead to important
consequences. TI have in my possession a piece of a fir-tree,
from which a portion of bark, extending round its whole
