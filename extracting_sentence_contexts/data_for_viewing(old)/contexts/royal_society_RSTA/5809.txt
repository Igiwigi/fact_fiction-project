with a five-point stencil, which has fourth-order accuracy. The first two and last two time :
derivatives are computed using one-sided finite-difference approximations with the same order of 28
accuracy. To remove redundant terms in the original Kronecker product, in practice, we employ a [8
compact Kronecker product in which the duplicate terms are removed. For instance, the standard ,
Kronecker product of a vector s= [s1,s2]' with itself yields Ist, $182, 5281,83]", whereas for the
compact Kronecker product we have [s7, $182, ae The Kronecker product of two column vectors
of length r contains only r(r + 1)/2 unique quadratic terms.

(a) Burgers’ problem for shock propagation

We assess the method’s performance on the inviscid Burgers’ equation for shock propagation in a
one-dimensional domain [17,18,21,46,47]. This problem is particularly challenging for projection-
based ROMs. The difficulty arises from the fact that ROMs approximate the solution as a linear
combination of spatially fixed reduced basis functions. However, when the underlying system
dynamics exhibit motion with respect to a fixed grid, ROMs that use a global POD basis generally
fail to capture the space-time evolution of the local phenomena accurately. Consider the following
one-dimensional initial-boundary-value problem:

2 s( t) + s(x, D2 scx, t)=g(x); xe [0,100], t € [0,50], (4.1)
with s(x, f) the unknown conserved quantity, and the forcing term g(x) = 0.02e°°*. The Dirichlet
boundary condition used for the above PDE is

3(0, #) = sc, (4.2)
which is constant with time. The initial condition is given by
