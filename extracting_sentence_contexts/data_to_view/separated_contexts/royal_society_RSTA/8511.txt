Ordinarily we should not expect much
variation in the velocities, for such places are intermediate in character between
narrow channels and the open shore, and therefore the currents in them may be
expected to show some increase in shallow water, but not so much as would be caused
by a proportional decrease in depth along a narrow bay or in approaching the open
shore. In shallow water also friction may, and often does, neutralize the magnifica-
tion that would occur in its absence. One other fact may be noted. In shallow bays the difficulties of navigation
may be great, and navigators avoid them if possible by choosing a harbour
near the entrance. Thus observations of currents are most numerous about the
entrances, and often at the very places where the currents, and consequently the
dissipation, are greatest there are insuflicient observations to give a satisfactory
estimate.
