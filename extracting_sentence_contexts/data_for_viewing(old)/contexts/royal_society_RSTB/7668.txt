Two features of the carotid rete are of especial interest, first, its high degree of develop-
ment in those species of animal in which the internal carotid artery has degenerated, or is
undergoing degeneration, and secondly, its situation along the path of the major vessel
or vessels which supply blood to the brain. It would seem that in those species in which
it is present the carotid rete is of some haemodynamic significance in relation to the
cerebral circulation. The fact that the rete, whether situated intracranially or extra-

cranially, lies within a venous lake is another feature of interest, which probably has
a physiological significance. The reason why some species have a carotid rete while others
do not is not at all obvious, and the fact that even in those species in which a rete is
present the vessels which supply it are not the same (e.g. the cat, the sheep, and the
pig) makes the problem still more complex. Not the least of the peculiarities which has
to be explained is the presence of a carotid rete in species so diverse in their habits as
Felidae and Artiodactyla. Much more information is required from comparative ana-
tomical and physiological studies before a satisfactory explanation for the existence of the
rete is forthcoming. In the meanwhile, the carotid rete is clearly a structure whose
existence and possible influence should not be overlooked when problems of the cerebral
circulation are being considered in animals in which it is present.

We should like to express our gratitude to Mr R. Beesley for technical assistance.
