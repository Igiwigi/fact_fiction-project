aspect. The whole of this wall material is soluble on full maceration, apart from the
cuticle which merely shows a cell outline. These cells are seen clearly near the aperture,
but elsewhere they are partly obscured by deeper layers of cells.

The sporangia yield two cuticles, both very delicate. The outer cuticle shows the
very faintly marked outlines of these epidermal cells; the inner (to which pollen grains
often adhere) shows obscure outlines of large, broad cells (about 60 30,), the whole
surface being covered by conspicuous granules, This appears to be the innermost
cutinized layer of the wall, next the tapetum. (A layer matching this is found in some
at least of the living Cycads.)

Although all the pollen sacs had dehisced, the pollen was very imperfectly shed;
in fact every sporangium examined yielded some grains, while some sporangia yielded
large numbers.

The pollen grains are oval, the mean size is 36 x 264; the longest measured 40y,
the shortest 26 (these figures omit specimens which appeared crushed). Most of the
grains are well preserved, though some show folds in the wall caused by crushing;
in all the best specimens a single longitudinal groove is evident, as is shown in various
views in figure 1. The exine is almost perfectly smooth, but in favourable specimens
can be seen to be very finely mottled.

A. manis is distinguished from A. wonnacotti by its larger size, the relatively broader
distal region of its sporophylls, its slightly larger pollen grains and its more sunken
stomata. The specific name is from Manis the pangolin, and refers to the appearance
