60 DR. W. ROBINSON ON THE MICROSCOPICAL FEATURES OF STRAINS IN

BenAviour or Compressep Woop Towarps Potarisep Lica. The facts regarding the nature of the deformations in the cell-walls of compressed
specimens and the interpretations which have been outlined above, received striking
confirmation by the use of the polariscope. It was found that the optical properties
of the walls of the deformed tracheides had been altered in important respects. Under low powers of the microscope, with crossed nicols, the zone of failure, both in
radial and tangential sections, stands out as a very bright band across the unaltered
parts of the section.
