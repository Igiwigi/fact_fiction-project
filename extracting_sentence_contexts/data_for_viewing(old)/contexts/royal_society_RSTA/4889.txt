and the HAT-CN lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels, a heterojunction
formed by these two materials is capable of dark generation of mobile charges in moderate electric
fields, a process that is frequently used in practical OLEDs to generate holes. The reverse reaction
is a typical recombination process, with one distinctive feature: the same close alignment of
energy levels that allows dark charge generation also unavoidably precludes recombination from
producing any electronically excited states of the molecules involved in a recombination event.
In fact, the only electronic states energetically accessible as final products of such recombination
are the ground singlet states. Therefore, the yield of singlets is 100% and the yield of the emissive
excited state (nr) is 0%. Although this example neither explains high efficiencies nor suggests the
possibility of higher-than-expected yields of the emissive singlets, it clearly demonstrates that the
spin-statistical 3: 1 ratio can be drastically perturbed, for example, by the energetic factor.

In fact, the deviations resulting in an increased yield of singlet excited states have also been
proposed to occur in polymer electroluminescence as early as 1999 [14]. Although these initial
findings were supported by soon-followed experimental and theoretical work [15,16], more recent
studies suggest that the excited singlet yield of recombination is unlikely to exceed 25%. For
an in-depth summary of the fascinating evolution in understanding the recombination yield in
polymeric materials the reader is directed to a recent review [17].

With 25% recombination yield of excited singlets, the only plausible explanation of
substantially-above-the-estimate efficiencies of fluorescent devices requires some form of post-
recombination conversion of triplet states into emissive singlet excited states. In principle, the
possible mechanisms can be classified into two groups: (i) intersystem crossing, involving one-
to-one conversion of triplets into excited singlets, thus summarily producing up to 100% excited
singlets, and (ii) triplet-triplet annihilation (TTA; also known as triplet fusion), which requires
