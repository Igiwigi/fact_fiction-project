that the extension of Calandra under discussion represents the hypopharyngeal suspensoria
of a more generalized insect, which in the course of profound modification of the head
have taken up a new position and function. Whatever its origin, however, the signi-
ficance of the extension in the present paper lies in the support it affords to the floor of
the pharynx.

Turning now to the articulation of the maxilla, it will have been realized that the
cardo (figure 7, car.), when seen in lateral view, lies almost vertically in front of the curved
rear wall (around which the arrow in figure 7 sweeps) of the cleft which separates the
labium from the pregena. From this wall, where it turns forward to become confluent
with the lateral wall of the labium, the proarthris (p. 254 and figures 5, 7, pr.) arises radially
at the level of the ‘eaves’ of the gable section of the base of the labium. It is therefore
directed antero-laterally towards the pregena, so much so, in fact, that were it not for the
depression in the wall of the pregena mentioned below, the cardo of the maxilla could not
be accommodated at its tip.

Lateral to the base of the proarthris, and therefore immediately posterior to its tip, a
window-like aperture in the posterior wall of the labio-pregenal cleft provides access for
the maxillary tendons passing to the cardo and lacinia, and also for the nerves and tracheae
of the limb. This window extends across the full width of the curved wall, and its lateral
margin sweeps forward on to the median wall of the pregena where it terminates in a
considerable depression which provides clearance for the sweep of the proximal part of
the cardo of the maxilla.

The arthrodial membrane of the maxilla is, of course, attached around the margin
