That with time the y-rays from the active deposit might ionize in again a different
way and produce again new lines. One would expect that the self-effect—as it may
be called—is go drastic that it destroys those configurations which should give the red
spectrum analogous to that in the other gases. It is a fact, as I hope to show, that
the spectrum, so much as there is of it, is decidedly of the jar, or blue kind. The degree of accuracy of the observations is not of the best. Royp claims an
accuracy of 0°1A.
