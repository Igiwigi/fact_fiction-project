to generalized allometry, e.g. surface/volume changes, freezing out of degrees of freedom, or
generalized senescence that means at some point their specific entropy production goes down.
This is easily seen in the development of a single BC, and shows just why cells divide rather than
just grow big (e.g. [8,20] for detailed study). Living systems are subject to all the same generics
amplified even further. Further if one understands the ‘what’, ‘why’ and ‘how’ of living things
(§5a) (arbitrariness with respect to local potentials) the behavioural ‘strategies’ living systems
employ will mean dramatic ups and downs in their entropy production simply due to what they
are and why they were physically selected in the first place [4]. The fourth law, valid in all ranges,
near and far from equilibrium answers an entirely different question than the failed MEPz and it
is important that these two not be conflated. To miss this point is not only to misunderstand the
physics but the whole origin, nature and evolution of life and cognition.

Confusions concerning Prigogine’s minEP principle (which does not, in fact, conflict with
LMEP) and Jayne’s MaxEnt, an information-theoretical inference method are discussed elsewhere
[20,31].
