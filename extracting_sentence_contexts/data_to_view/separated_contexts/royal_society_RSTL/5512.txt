With regard to gold-leaf no question respecting its metallic nature can arise, but it
offers evidence reaching to the other preparations. 'The green colour conferred by
pressure, and the remoyal of this colour by heat, evidently belong to it as a metal; these
effects are very striking and important as regards the action on light, and where they
recur with other forms of gold, may be accepted as proof that the gold is in the metallic
state. Although I do not attach equal importance to the fact already described, that
gold-leaf frequently presents fine parts that appear to be ruby in colour, I am not, as
yet satisfied that they are not in themselves ruby; and if they should be s0, it will be
another proof by analogy of the metallic nature of other kinds of preparations eminently
ruby. The deflagrations of gold wire by the Leyden discharge can be nothing but divided
gold. They are the same whatever the atmosphere swrounding them at the time, or
whatever the substance on which they are deposited.
