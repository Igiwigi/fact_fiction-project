diate form between an “ escape cell” and “escape mass.” In c the th
wall is complete only on one side.

Fig. 23a, b,c, d,e, f,and g. X 600. Preparation as in fig. 15. These figures show
great variation in size and structure of “escape cells” met with in t
preparations; @ and b show the possibility of division of the nu
b, c, and d show the nucleus in process of extrusion; e and g show
extremely small these cells may be in comparison with such forms F
fig. 21a and b; f (as also in fig. 22a) shows a stout strand of club be
material that has been ruptured in the process of “shelling out” of
cell. In all, the outer surface is seen to be beset with spines of
original lattice work—a fact also frequently clear in sections c, f, fig. 6e,

N.B.—AIl the figures upon this Plate, with the single exception of —
