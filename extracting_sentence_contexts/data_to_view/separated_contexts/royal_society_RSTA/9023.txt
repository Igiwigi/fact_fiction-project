It is, therefore, a general fact that, without exception, the energy in the bulb
spectrum has been transferred towards the members of higher term number in all the
component series—provided, as later investigation shows, that the effect is not due to
a mere change in the energy distribution within the lines. The Helium Spectrum from the Capillary with a Condensed Discharge.—
On Plate 3 is shown the wedge photograph of the Helium spectrum from the
capillary produced by means of a powerful condensed discharge with a spark-gap in
the circuit, and for comparison, the ordinary spectrum developed on the same plate. The quantitative analysis follows the same method as in the last section, and the
results for one plate are exhibited in the table below.
