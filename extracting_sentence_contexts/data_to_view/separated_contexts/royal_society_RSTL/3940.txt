The labour required in the different processes of reduction has
now been gone through; and it remains to bring together in one view the evidence
which the three observational and the two derived elements furnish of the periodical
laws, decennial, annual and diurnal, which regulate the occurrence of the larger
disturbances.

& In respect to the decennial period, it must be regarded as a fortunate circumstance,

Sthat the five years of hourly observation, which were commenced before the exist-
Tence of any inequality of longer duration than a year was suspected, began with
21843, the year of minimum, and closed with 1848, the year of maximum disturbance,
50 that the variation has been followed through a complete phase. This has been
Strictly the case in the Declination and Horizontal Forces, and with a single excep-
Stion in the Vertical Force also, the exception being caused by the interruption of
Zthe observations of that element, for purposes explained elsewhere, during the
Zmonths of October, November and December 1843, and January and February
21844, These months have been supplied in the year ending June 1844, from hourly
Sobservations made with the same apparatus in the preceding year, viz. in the months
Zof October, November and December 1842, and January and February 1843; thus
Erendering the five years of the Vertical Force complete for the investigation of the
Eannual and diurnal variations, but of course in regard to the decennial period the
"= months taken from a different year, even though it be the adjacent one, are not a
perfect substitute. The effect of this substitution has been in fact to swell the
Z aggregate value of the disturbances of the Vertical Force in the year nominally ending
s June 30, 1844, but really comprising five months taken from a preceding year, 80 as
E to make them lightly exceed the aggregate value in the year ending June 30, 1845.
& A similar slight excess in the aggregate value of the disturbances of the Horizontal
Force in the year ending June 1844 over the aggregate value in the year ending June
1845, is found when the same five months of the preceding year are substituted for
its own months; but when in the case of the Horizontal Force (the observations of
which were not suspended as were those of the Vertical Force) the actual observations
throughout the year ending June 1844 are taken, the true progression is restored, and
the apparent anomaly disappears.

'The variations of the three magnetic elements being measured by instruments
wholly distinct and unconnected with each other, each element affords an independent
evidence of the progressive increase in the aggregate values of the larger disturbances
during the period under examination. The sum of the aggregate values of each

element in the five years, divided by 5, gives the mean annual yalue of that element,
which we may take in each case, for the purpose of comparison with the actual
aggregate values in the different years, as equal to 1:00; we have then the ratios of
the disturbances of the different elements in the different years as follows :â€”
