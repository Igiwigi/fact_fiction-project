a floating collimator. 169

On examining the above table, it appears that by taking
the mean of a very few results, the greatest error, if the
experiments with the wooden float be rejected, is four-tenths
of a second, consequently the place of the horizontal point
may be speedily determined by the use of the collimator, to
the utmost degree of accuracy which the astronomical circle
employed, is capable of attaining. The results obtained by turning the collimator round with-
out removing the float from the mercury, might have been
expected to have been very nearly, if not wholly free from
error :; but as this does not appear to. be the fact, and as the
errors are all in defect, they seem to have been influenced by
some constant cause, which, as before remarked, I believe
to have been expansion of the stand of the micrometer in
consequence of increased temperature. When the float is removed in order to transport the box
containing the mercury to the opposite side of the observa-
tory, the manner of replacing it, so as to occasion the least
error, seems to be that of bringing the edge of the side of
the float first in contact with the mercury, and then gra-
dually lowering it. This mode of removal can be necessary
only when the collimator is used with a portable circle ; but
in a fixed observatory a plank should be laid, or a sort of
railway contrived from one support to the other, on which
the collimator should be either slid or passed along on rollers
without removing the float from the mercury ; by this ar-
rangement the greatest, and perhaps the only source of error
would be avoided.*

* It may perhaps be found preferable to have two boxes with mercury, and to
carry the float from one to the other,
