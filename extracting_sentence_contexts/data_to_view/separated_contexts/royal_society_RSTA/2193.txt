a monthly stipend so that he could continue ‘doing his sums,’ in the words of Janaki many years
later. Ramanujan did not feel comfortable with receiving money without ‘working’, and
consequently he applied for a position as a clerk in the Madras Port Trust office. One cannot
overestimate the importance of Ramanujan’s decision to submit such an application, the foresight
of the Madras Port Trust to offer him a position, and the fact that the chief accountant at the
office was S. Narayana Aiyer, who was one of the best mathematicians in India at that time. Janaki later reported that her husband would work in the office during the day, and that in
the evening he and Narayana Aiyar would work on mathematics until the wee hours of the
morning.
