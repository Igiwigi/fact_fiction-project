The © Terrella,” by which Hairty figured to himself a cause capable of producing
phenomena of the order and regularity of those which his laborious and extensive
generalization had disclosed to him, has never, I imagine, found favour as a probable
physical reality. Viewed simply as an illustration of the systematic arrangement, sym-
metrical progression, and exceeding regularity of: the effects, and the consequent neces-
8ity for the admission of qualities of the same order in the causes, of the terrestrial
magnetism and its secular changes, HALLgy's Terrella had its proper value; and it
would have been well if the lesson which it inculcated had received more considera-
tion than it has done from those who, more than a century after his publications, have
attempted to explain the phenomena of the progressive magnetic change by accidental
or adyentitious variations in the superficial temperature of the globe or of its atmo-
Sphere, or in the occasional development or protrusion of magnetically attractive or
repulsive rocks beneath its surface. The order and harmony of the facts manifested by
the researches of a much earlier date had already effectually removed them from the
category of partial or accidental occurrences. The symmetry of their general distribu-
tion, the counterpart to each other presented by the phenomena of the northern and
southern terrestrial hemispheres, and the regularity with which the periodical changes
take place, indicated a systematic cansation which, obscure as it might be, was obviously
anything but fortuitous. And when to the increased knowledge of the general pheno-
mena acquired in the last and present centuries, confirming and extending the previous
conclusions, was added the evidence obtained by the observations of the British Colonial
Observatories, that the secular change is progressive in the extremest sense, that each
week shows (and that if the means of observation were sufficiently refined it is more
than probable that each day would show) an exact aliquot part of the annual change,
the conviction became almost irresistible, that the causes which produce such remark-
