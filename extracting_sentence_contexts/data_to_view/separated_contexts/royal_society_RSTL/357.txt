BABBAGE's essay towards

make fi equal to w, for in this ease we at once determine 4»
to be equal to », which is not always true;

The same observation may be made with respect to making
f*@=»x, forin this caze V @=a, Va=myso, Va=n,
va=vz, and we in fact by assuming this value for f deter-
mine 4 from the equation

F is, yo, x,wvT, 7, &e. } =0

The same objection does not hold when we make f*v=x,
though this considerably limits the generality of the solution;
apparently the most eligible mode of determining F is from the
equation f"+! zy=w, ſor in this case Supposing we are acquaint-
ed with a particular solution of (@) containing any number
of arbitrary constants, such as

on=A {a, a, b, c, &. }
we may substitute for each of these constants an arbitrary
function, such as © :
x {, 14, 7*Þ, ee fon]
for it is evident this function does not change when we substi-
tute f" w for x. But this form of F'is not always correct, it may be incon-
sistent with the original equation. In fact, the only value we
can assign to f which shall not in some measure limit the
generality of the Problem, is to suppose a particular solution
of the given equation. As an example of this method take the following problem. D


the calculus of functiong. 419

Required the nature of the curve ADE sucl that taking any
abscissa AB and corresponding ordinate DB : if the abscissa
AC be taken, equal-to DB and the ordinate EC be drawn,
then the rectangle under the two ordinates shall be equal to
the square of the first abscissa let the equation-of the curve
be y=4z then AB=z DB=y=yo AC=DB,
and EC=y (AC) = (DB) =vy = whe
the given condition is therefore
Vaoxyo=at _
making the usual substitution of Þz = þ* f© x it becomes
I Ef pnxFf one
putting ©' » for-x we have
EO fax0fo=($ a)
Assume © ax=x(a,fo,fo)
the equation then becomes
zifo flo fu} xx {fo fi fi} =[x {ofa fu}]
If now F be determined from the equation
FO a=0x
we have f* » = f, and the equation becomes identical,
hence &' and f being found, we may determine y.
