vesicle is by no means clear. The latter may have grown forward and constricted
into two, which I now think the more probable explanation, or the pineal sac may
have been formed as a second evagination of the brain-roof, involving the aperture of

* T was unable to demonstrate this communication in my earlier work. SCHAUINSLAND (1903) has
since done so, and I have myself now found it in Embryo 32a (fig. 30).

the first. There can be no doubt that they actually lie one behind the other rather
than side by side, but the tendency of the anterior one to lie a little to the left of
the posterior is very strongly marked, and the fact that the primary vesicle also
generally (?) originates on the left side of the middle line seems to me to indicate that
it may possibly give rise only to the pineal eye, and that the pineal sac may be
formed by a fresh evagination in the middle line.*

From its first appearance, at any rate as an independent structure, apart from the
pineal eye, the pineal sac points forwards over the roof of the brain (fig. 31). Tt
rapidly assumes a finger-like shape, and its aperture becomes constricted as the
superior and posterior commissures develop in front of and behind it respectively
(figs. 31, 33, 35, 45, 46). At-the same time, the lumen disappears more or less
completely from its proximal portion, and it remains connected with the brain-roof
only by the pineal tract, which will be dealt with more fully when we come to discuss
the right pineal nerve.
