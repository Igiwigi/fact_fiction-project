But this is again simply the first condition of V.,§7. The whole of the conditions V.

for the congruence of fourth degree may in fact be derived by writing down the

conditions III. for each aggregate ABC, ABD, ACD, BCD, inserting the universes
a D or 5 in the first case, C or y in the second, and so on. Evidently this will give the
S right number of conditions, there being four aggregates and four conditions for each,
4 while each condition must hold good in two universes, total 4 x 4 x 2 = 32.
‘A precisely similar theorem holds good for the 160 conditions of § 9, VIL., for the
B.congruence of the fifth degree. The congruence of second order and fifth degree
3 may be resolved into fen congruences of the third degree. The fowr conditions
of ILL must hold good for each of these congruences in four universes, ¢.g., for the
Stggregate ABC, the universes DE, De, 6E, Se. The whole number of conditions so
6 derived is 10 X 4 X 4, or 160. The sixteen conditions of VIII., § 9, cannot be so
2 derived; they involve five, not three, fifth-order frequencies each, and are quite new
