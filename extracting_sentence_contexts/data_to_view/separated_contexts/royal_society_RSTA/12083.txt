These conditions as to the distribution of &, &e.,
are, however, obviously satisfied in the case of heat motion, and do not present
themselves otherwise in this paper. ;

From the definite geometrical basis thus obtained, and the definite expressions
which follow for the condition of distribution of u, &e., under which the method of
analysis is strictly applicable, it appears that this method may be rendered generally
applicable to any system of motion by a slight adaptation of the meaning of the
symbols, and that it does not necessitate the elimination of the internal motion of
the molecules, as has been the custom in the theory of gases.

‘Taking u, v, w to represent the motions (continuous or discontinuous) of the matter
passing a point, and p to represent the density at the point, and putting u, &e., for
the mean-motion (instead of w as above), and w’, &c., for the relative-motion (instead

of €as before), the geometrical conditions as to the distribution of w, &e., to satisfy
the conditions of mean-momentum and mean-energy are, substituting p for M, of
precisely the same form as before, and as thus expressed, the theorem is applicable to
any mechanical system however abstract.

(1) In order to obtain the conditions of distribution of molar-motion, under which
the condition of mean-momentum will be satisfied so that the energy of molar-motion
may be separated from that of the heat-motion, u, &c., and p are taken as referring to
the actual motion and density at a point in a molecule, and §, is taken of such
dimensions as may correspond to the scale, or periods in space, of the molecular

distances, then the conditions of distribution of u, under which the condition of mean-
momentum is satisfied, become the conditions as to the distribution of molar-motion,
under which it is possible to distinguish between the energies of molar-motions and
heat-motions.

(2) And, when the conditions in (1) are satisfied to a sufficient degree of approxi-

mation by taking w to represent the molar-motion (w in ( 1)), and the dimensions of
the space S to correspond with the period in space or scale of any possible periodic or

eddying motion. The conditions as to the distribution of u, &e. (the components of
mean-mean-motion), which satisfy the condition of mean-momentum, show the
conditions of mean-molar-motion, under which it is possible to separate the energy
of mean-molar-motion from the energy of relative-molar- (or relative-mean-) motion ;

Having thus placed the analytical method used in the kinetic theory on a definite
geometrical basis, and adapted so as to render it applicable to all systems of motion,
by applying it to the dynamical theory of viscous fluid, I have been able to show :—

(a) That the adoption of the conclusion arrived at by Sir Gaprtet Sroxes, that the
dissipation function represents the rate at which heat is produced,

to the meaning of u, v, w—the components of me
previously wanting ;

adds a definition

(b) That as the result of this definition the equations are true, and are only true
as applied to fluid in which the mean-motions of the matter, excluding the heat-
motions, are steady ;

(c) That the evidence of the possible existence of such steady mean-motions, while
at the same time the conversion of the energy of these mean-motions into heat is
going on, proves the existence of some discriminative cause by which the periods in
space and time of the mean-motion are prevented from approximating in magnitude
to the corresponding periods of the heat-motions, and also proves the existence of
some general action by which the energy of mean-motion is continually transformed

Sinto the energy of heat-motion without passing through any intermediate stage ;

S (d) That as applied to fluid in unsteady mean-motion (excluding the heat-motions),

“ghowever steady the mean integral flow may be, the equations are approximately true

Sin a degree which increases with the ratios of the magnitudes of the periods, in time

and space, of the mean-motion to the magnitude of the corresponding periods of the

heat-motions ;

= (e) That if the diseriminative cause and the action of transformation are the result

Sof general properties of matter, and not of properties which affect only the ultimate

motions, there must exist evidence of similar actions as between the mean-mean-

‘Zmotion, in directions of mean flow, and the periodic mean-motions taken relative to

"Sthe mean-mean-motion but excluding heat-motions. And that such evidence must be

Sof a general and important kind, such as the unexplained laws of the resistance of

‘Sfluid motions, the law of the universal dissipation of energy and the second law of

‘Sthermodynamics ;

£ (/) That the generality of the effects of the properties on which the action of trans-

@formation depends is proved by the fact that resistance, other than proportional to

the velocity, is caused by the relative (eddying) mean-motion. S (g) That the existence of the discriminative cause is directly proved by the

existence of the criterion, the dependence of which on circumstances which limit the

“Zmagnitudes of the periods of relative mean-motion, as compared with the heat-motion,

"galso proves the generality of the effects of the properties on which it depends.

8 (h) That the proof of the generality of the effects of the properties on which the
discriminative cause, and the action of transformation depend, shows that—if in the
equations of motion the mean-mean-motion is distinguished from the relative-mean-
motion in the same way as the mean-motion is distinguished from the heat-motions—
(1) the equations must contain expressions for the transformation of the energy of
mean-mean-motion to energy of relative-mean-motion ; and (2) that the equations,
when integrated over a complete system, must show that the possibility of relative-
mean-motion depends on the ratio of the possible magnitudes of the periods of relative-
mean-motion, as compared with the corresponding magnitude of the periods of the
heat-motions.

(i) That when the equations are transformed so as to distinguish between the

mean-mean-motions, of infinite periods, and the relative-mean-motions of finite periods,

there result two distinct systems of equations, one system for mean-mean-motion, as

affected by relative-mean-motion and heat-motion, the other system for relative-mean-

motion as affected by mean-mean-motion and heat-motions.

(j) That the equation of energy of mean-mean-motion, as obtained from the first
system, shows that the rate of increase of energy 18 diminished by conversion into
heat, and by transformation of energy of mean-mean-motion in consequence of the
velative-mean-motion, which transformation is expressed by a function identical in
form with that which expresses the conversion into heat ; and that the equation of
energy of relative-mean-motion, obtained from the second system, shows that this
energy is increased only by transformation of energy from mean-mean-motion
expressed by the same function, and diminished only by the conversion of energy
of relative-mean-motion into heat.

(k) That the difference of the two rates (1) transformation of energy of mean-mean-
motion into energy of relative-mean-motion as expressed by the transformation
function, (2) the conversion of energy of relative-mean-motion into heat, as expressed
by the function expressing dissipation of the energy of relative-mean-motion, affords
a discriminating equation as to the conditions under which relative-mean-motion
can be maintained.

(1) That this discriminating equation is independent of the energy of relative-mean-
motion, and expresses a relation between variations of mean-mean-motion of the first
order, the space periods of relative-mean-motion and jz/p such that any circumstances
which determine the maximum periods of the relative-mean-motion determine the
conditions of mean-mean-motion under which relative mean-motion will be maintained
-—determine the criterion.

(m) That as applied to water in steady mean flow between parallel plane surfaces,
the boundary conditions and the equation of continuity impose limits to the maximum
space periods of relative-mean-motion such that the discriminating equation affords
definite proof that when an indefinitely small sinuous or relative disturbance exists
it must fade away if
