'Sthe range of sand employed having been that of Killiney Strand, and of granite that of
ZDalkey Island, both on the east coast of Ireland. These results produced some surprise
on my own part as well as on that of others, —the transit-velocities obtained falling
Zzreatly below those which theory might have suggested as possible, based upon the
modulus of elasticity of the material constituting the range in either case. 2 TI snggested as the explanation of the low velocities ascertained, that the media of
the ranges (like all the solids constituting the crust of the earth) were not in fact united
Sand homogeneous elastic solids, but an aggregation of solids more or less shattered,
Eheterogeneous, and discontinuous, and that to the loss of vis wwe, and of time, in the
Epropagation of the wave from surface to surface, was due the extremely low velocities
Eobserved. Z The correctness of this view, and a general corroboration of the correctness of the
Sexperimental results themselves, have since been made known by the careful determina-
Stions by NoGceRaTY and Scnapr respectively, of the transit-velocities of actual carth-
& quake waves in the superficial formations of the Rhine country and of Hungary, and by
myself in those of Southern Italy, all of which present low velocities coordinating readily
with my previous experimental results. -

In the Report above mentioned, I suggested the desirableness of extending the expe-
Timental determination of wave-transit to stratified and foliated rocks, as likely to pre-
sent still lower velocities than those obtained for shattered granite, as well as other
important or suggestive phenomena.
