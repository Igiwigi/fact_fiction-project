And, of course, under the stress, a lumen in whi
rupture has occurred at once becomes water-free and useless. The question of the stability under tension of water containing dissolved air bei
therefore involved, we made some experiments to settle the matter one way or th
other. We found that the presence of dissolved air did not interfere with the atte
ment of high tensions ; in fact, when all solid objects present had been wetted by p
preliminary boiling the presence of considerable quantities of dissolved air seemed in
way to interefere with the success of the experiment. Air-free water gave no bette
results, nor (whether from chance or not) gave results quite so good. In mo
cases rupture appeared ultimately to occur upon the wall of the tube.
