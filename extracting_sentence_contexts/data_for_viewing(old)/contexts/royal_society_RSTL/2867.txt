s8equence of the slow progress of the tide-wave near the shore. Tt is probable that
the peculiarities which we thus discover to coexist in the motion of the diurnal and
of the semidiurnal wave would be found to be connected, if we could analyse the
hydrodynamical laws of the ocean.

The motion of the diurnal waye being thus irregular, we can account for the
variety of values of the diurnal inequality at different places. We can also conceive
this wave to move in a manner even more irregular than we have yet described ; and

some of the facts do appear to indicate this further irregularity. For example, the
diurnal inequality appears sometimes, for several days, to leap from its proper tides
to the alternate tides, without vanishing in the transition, as in rule it does. Now
this irregular movement may be accounted for by supposing that the diurnal wave,
which usually completes its oscillation and returns in twenty-four (lunar) hours, does
sometimes occupy a longer or shorter time in the oscillation. If, for instance, this
wave, after arriving four hours before the s4perior high water of one day, arrive
again twenty hours afterwards and therefore eight hours before the superior tide of
the next day, it will be only four hours after the inferior high water of the second day;
and therefore the diurnal inequality will pass from the superior to the inferior tide
by a leap. There appear to be several cases implying a change of this kind, but the
snbject is s0 complex and s0 lahorious that I shall not now pursue it.
