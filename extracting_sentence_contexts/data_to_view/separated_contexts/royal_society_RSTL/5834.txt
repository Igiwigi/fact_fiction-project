In fact, it is a mistake to suppose that the Pro-
cess of ova- and sperm-development, in any Annelid, is limited to a month or two in the
year. Ova in an immature state are found in the bodies of the youngest as of the
oldest. This fact proves that the structures by which the ova are generated must be
permanently present. The preceding account of the segmental organs of the Sabellidee and Serpulidz has
been drawn from an examination of the following species:—S. alveolata, S. vesiculosa,
Leucodore cliatus (very favourable for this purpose), Amphitrite auricoma, Sabella @
sang vert, Sabella hospita (mihi). Of the Serpulide the author has only studied with
care the following species :—5S. triguetra, S. contortuplicata, S. lactea.
