These factors complicate our efforts to find, measure and
extrapolate TEI fluxes across ocean basins. GEOTRACES observations are unveiling the
oceanic distributions of many TEIs for the first time. These data evidence the influence of the
sedimentâ€”water boundary on many TEI cycles, and underline the fact that our knowledge
of the source-sink fluxes that sustain oceanic distributions is largely missing. Present flux
measurements provide low spatial coverage and only part of the empirical basis needed
to predict TEI flux variations. Many of the advances and present challenges facing TEI
flux measurements are linked to process studies that collect sediment cores, pore waters,

sinking material or seawater in close contact with sediments.
