This assumption, which has been generally accepted,
might well have thrown doubt on the validity of Komnte’s theory, since, as a matter
of fact, no striations are formed unless the amplitude of vibration exceeds a certain
threshold value (see Section 2), and it is known that such a threshold value, reached
as we proceed to large velocities, generally signifies that the medium has ceased to
behave even approximately as a perfect fluid. KogEniG supposed that the ridges were formed by the action of the repulsive forces
between the spheres along the axis of the tube. The difficulty arises that, if only
repulsive forces exist in this direction, there seems no reason why the particles should
arrange themselves in regular striations, although if the striations already existed
the variation of the forces with the square of the velocity might be invoked to explain
the fact that the ridges are most widely spaced at the antinode. Konig somewhat
diffidently states: “It remains an open question whether the distance of the two ribs
must be regarded as the measure of the distance at which the forces are already too
weak to occasion further movement of the dust particles. For repulsive forces act
on both sides of any cross ridge, and for the stable position of such a wall it would be
a sufficient condition that the difference of the forces should be small enough not to be
effective.
