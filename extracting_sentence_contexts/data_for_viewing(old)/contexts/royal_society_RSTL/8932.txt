Surgeons ; and Dr. GtxTuzr, F,R.S., for tadpoles of that type.

+ Therelation of the upper labials to the yestibule of the nasal labyrinth is of great interest ; T have carefully
worked out these parts in Sharks, Skates, Teleostei, Anura, Serpents, many kinds of Birds (Trans. Linn. Soc.

8eT, 2, yol. i. plates 1-5 and 20-27; and Trans. Zool. Soe. 1875, vol. ix. plates 54-62), and in the Mammal (the
« Pig's Skull,” Phil. Trans, 1874, plates xxxi.-xxxyi.).

604 MR. W. K. PARKER ON THE STRUCTURE AND

The meaning of these facts will come out with great distinctness when I come to
describe their development in the ©* Aglossal” Toads; and in all the Batrachia we have
most instructive foreshadowings of the complex nasal labyrinth of the bird, and of the
endless galleries of the ethmoidal and septal structures of carnivorous and herbivorous
mammals.

At once it may be well to state that in those higher forms the distal ends of the
trabeculz, © hypotrabecular ” or © recurrent cartilages,” do not straighten ont, as in
these Batrachia ; but the hooked or retral condition seen in the Bird and Pig also occurs
in many of the Batrachia, The median or keystone part (prenasal or basitrabecular
cartilage) is but little deyeloped in the Frog (Plate 54. figs. 1 & 2, pn.); it is more
distinct in Pipa (Plate 62. figs. 5 & 6, pn.).
