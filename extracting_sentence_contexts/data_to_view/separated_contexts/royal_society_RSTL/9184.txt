Until lately, line spectra have kept out of the way of the many difteul-
ties which beset their brethren of different orders, but at last they could no more
resist the invasion. It gradually appeared that lines which are prominent at one tem-
perature may be comparatively weak at another. This fact is 80metimes exaggerated to
such a degree that all the lines which form the spectrum of lower temperature
disappear without a remnant at higher temperatures, while the lines of higher tem-
perature are not to be seen at lower temperatures. Oxygen, which is a typical gas
for every difficulty in spectroscopy, is a case in point. Oxygen seems to have two
perfectly distineb line spectra, each of which generally appears by itself and unmixed
with a trace of the other spectrum.
