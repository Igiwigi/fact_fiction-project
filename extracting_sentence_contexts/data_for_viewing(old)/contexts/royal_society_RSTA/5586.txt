material, table S3. This indicates that the number of functional groups derived from the organic
substances in SD was reduced as carbonization was performed at higher temperatures. Figure 7c
shows the contributions of the different N components to the N1s spectrum. It was found that, as
the carbonization temperature was increased, the contents of the active N components, namely,
graphitic N and pyridinic N, decreased. On the other hand, that of pyrrolic N increased. In
addition, since the content of the inactive oxidized pyridinic N increased, it is speculated that
the pyridinic N was oxidized by the high-temperature carbonization process.

The ORR activity of the catalyst carbonized at 800°C was higher than that of the catalyst
carbonized at 700°C, although the former showed the highest active pyridinic N content as
well as the highest specific surface area. Therefore, it is likely that the increase in the electrical
conductivity owing to the formation of graphitic carbon and the increase in the relative amount of
Fe3C present also raised the ORR activity. This is supported by the fact that the amount of charge
during ORR at 0 rpm in the range between 0.6 and 1.0 V (versus RHE) shown in the electronic
supplementary material, table S4 was the largest in the catalyst calcined at 800°C.

Figure 8a shows TEM images of the carbon material with an Fe/N/SD ratio of 2:10:10 after
HTC and the catalysts formed by its carbonization at 700, 800 and 900°C. The dark areas contain
Fe and graphitic structures, such as graphite shell chains, in keeping with a previous report [9].
We further analysed the catalyst carbonized at 800°C using TEM/EDS and XANES analysis; the
results are shown in figure 8b-d. We analysed one point in the dark area in the TEM image of
