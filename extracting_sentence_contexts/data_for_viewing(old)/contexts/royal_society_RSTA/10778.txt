power to the alternating current circuit, and that this is the fact can easily be shown
experimentally by connecting a wattmeter so as to measure the power supplied to
the solid are by the alternating current, when it will be found that at low frequencies
the solid are is actually supplying power to the alternate-current circuit, while at
Srequencies above the critical value the alternate-current circuit supplies power to the
are. This observation is of course not in any way at variance with the principle
of conservation of energy, since the alternating energy given out by the are is

derived from the direct-current energy supplied to it, the are acting as a converter.
This fact, that the solid are is capable, under suitable conditions, of automatically
transforming energy derived from a source of direct current into alternate-current
energy of any frequency over a wide range, is the explanation of the transformation
of energy observed in the Musical Are recently shown for the first time at the
Institution of Electrical Engineers.*

Effect of Varying the Direct Current.
Having found that with a sufficiently high frequency it was possible to measure
the true resistance of the arc, this resistance was measured for ares of a fixed leneth
