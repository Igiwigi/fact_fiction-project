How-
ever, NGP homologies among the wing patterns of other
butterflies are less clear in this hypothesis. Additionally,
WntA expression patterns described above do not agree with
yellow as pattern. Neither hypothesis is consistent with the
fact that optix sometimes controls red patches that correspond
to ‘background’, while in other cases it controls red patches
that are ‘pattern’, nor that sometimes red overprints yellow,
yet sometimes yellow overprints red [60]. Instead, we suggest
that the distinction is not meaningful: there is a hierarchy of
factors that interact by both activation and inhibition of down-
stream factors. Optix is a paintbrush that can be co-opted to
colour wing regions already outlined by any part of this
upstream patterning landscape.
