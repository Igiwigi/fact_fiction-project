Experiments on the plasticity of glass have in fact been limited to determining the
rate of distortion for different loads under varying conditions of temperature, etc. It
seems that there would be no inconsistency in any existing experiments if the distortion
of glass under load were not that of a very viscous fluid but were similar to that of metals
for which v is not equal to ». Tt seemed worth while therefore to carry out tests with
glass tubes similar to those already described with metal tubes. These are described in
the Appendix. It was found that the change in volume of the bore of a heated glass
tube subjected to combined load and extension was so small as to be hardly measurable.
The small volume changes actually measured were used to calculate and y and v, and
the points so obtained are marked in fig. 10. It will be seen that in the case of glass,
von Mises’ second hypothesis y. = v is fulfilled, the small deviation of the observed points
from the straight line » = v being due partly to experimental error and partly to the
fact that the thickness of the wall is not quite negligible. This indicates not only that
heated glass does behave like a viscous fluid in regard to its distortion, but also that
the method of measuring » and v by observing changes in internal volume of a tube
under combined extension and twisting is susceptible of considerable accuracy.

Experiments with Lead and Cadmium.

Tt was found that lead tubes and cadmium tubes change their internal volumes much
less than copper, iron or aluminium tubes when subjected to combined extension and
twisting. In both cases we did not find that the change from pure extension to extension
combined with torsion produced a very definite bend in the curve connecting internal
volume with extension. This is shown in fig. 11. The part of the curve corresponding
with pure extension is from O to B. At the condition represented by B the load was
