When therefore the measurements come to be grouped into classes, as is necessary
before they can be statistically treated, in the majority of cases of course the actual
measurement of the selected individual will fall into the same class as will the mean
of the family it was taken from—and if not into that class, then in the next one to
it. Therefore, for all practical purposes this table gives the correlation coefficient
between ancestors and offspring, but if greater accuracy of definition be required it is
the correlation between the mean of a brood in one generation and the mean of the
brood produced by its most nearly average member in the other generation. On the other
hand, Table III gives the correlation between individual ancestors and their individual
offspring. (2) The “number of individuals per family” is the number measured,
not the number produced. (3) The “number of ancestors ” becomes less in
proportion to the number of families of’ offspring (Table II), or number of individual
offspring (Table III), as we rise in the scale of ancestry, owing to the fact, already
mentioned, that when in any generation the individual selected for parentage in the
a or b line failed by death or accident to leave a family, two individuals were chosen
from the surviving line in the next generation. There is, therefore, a slight
convergence of ancestry within a few of the clones.
