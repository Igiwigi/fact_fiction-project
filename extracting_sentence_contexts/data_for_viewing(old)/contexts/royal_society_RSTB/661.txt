end. This simple condition of the electric elements, which cannot, it appears to me,
be accounted for by saying that in 2. radiata the organ has undergone retrogressive
changes, is accompanied with a more primitive condition of the pectoral fin than is
found in other Skates and Rays, and with certain affinities to generalised Selachians
during development. In 2. circularis, although the electrical elements are still in
the form of cups, a decided advance has taken place. The elements are larger—
instead of shallow, thick-walled cups, there are deep, well-moulded cups, lined with a
highly differentiated electric layer, and provided with a thick, dense, nucleated
cortex, in place of the thin sarcolemma-like investment found in R. radiata. Further,
the development is more rapid, the anterior ends of the original muscular fibres
instead of retaining their characteristic striations have been modified to form a thick,
non-nucleated, striated, or meandriform layer, similar to the middle layer in R. batis.
Tn fact the muscular fibres have been so profoundly altered that without a knowledge
of the development of the cups in 2. circularis, it would be impossible to make out
that they were in any way related to muscular tissue.

In &. fullonica a still further advance has been made towards the conditions found
in R. batis, and the other Skate having disc-like electrical elements. Evidence of
this advance is especially found in the alveolar layer, which in structure stands
midway between 22. circularis and R. batis—there being outgrowths larger and more
complex than in &. cireularis, but not so complex as in FR. batis.

T may add, by way of conclusion, that my investigations have not yet enabled me
to offer any opinion as to the method by which the electric organs of fishes have been
produced. Until it is possible to show that during the initial stages, that during the
