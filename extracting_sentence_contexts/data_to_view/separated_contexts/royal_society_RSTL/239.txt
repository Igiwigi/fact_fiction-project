A s8econd argument brought by BerNoviLtr and D'*ALEMBERT
was, that since a: —a :: —aia (a =(—ae) - log. (a)*
= log. (—a) -- 2 log. (+ a) = 2 log. (—a) -. log. (a) =
log (a). This proposition, affirmed by D'ALEMBeRr to be strictly
true, viz. (a: —a :: —@ : a), was granted to be 80 by EULER,
although it ought to have been denied ; since, thus abstractedly
proposed, it is absurd and unintelligible, and impossible to be
proved. If, however,* (— a)* be assumed = (a)*, (—=1)*=

(1), then the equality log. (—a)* = log. (a)* becomes intel-
ligible ; since it means that the measure of the ratio between
(—a) and (—1)* is equal the measure of the ratio between (a)*
and (—1)*; but then this argument becomes the same as the
former, and is equally illusory ; for — @ and — 1 are in fact
made a and 1. If logarithms be defined, the measures of ratios
existing between real quantities, then it is absurd to attempt
deducing the logarithms of negative quantities from any reason-
ing on the relation that 1 has to — 1; since there is no neces-
sary connection between 1 and — 1; and, independently of
certain as$umptions, the ratio of 1: — 1 is perfectly unintel-
ligible. Indeed the question admits no other meaning than that
I originally assigned it : if a form demonstrated for positive
quantities be extended, then certain symbols may be exhibited,
which, agreeably to such extension, are called the logarithms of
negative quantities.
