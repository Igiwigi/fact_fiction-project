Asa further precaution, the gas next passed through a length of 73 centims.
8 of platinum tube immersed in a solution at the same temperature (C), and in many of
‘S__the experiments a guard tube, filled with NaF’, as recommended by M. Morssan, was

iS It was probable that some part of previously observed discrepancies arose from the

= this, the gases next passed through a spiral of platinum tube, 49 centims. in length,
g heated to from 250° to 300° C. (E). The bends, D and F, were immersed in iced
& Water to prevent conduction of heat from the spirals to the condenser on one side and
the refractometer tube on the other. The refractometer tube, H, was of platinum-iridium, 45°78 centims. long and
0°65 centim. in diameter, Its volume, with the leads, was 15°01 cub. centims.
