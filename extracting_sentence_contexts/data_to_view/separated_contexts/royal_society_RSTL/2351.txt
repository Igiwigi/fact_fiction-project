placs snccessivement dans le m&me point le milieu de PFaiguille de six pouces,
et celui Cune petite aiguille un demi-pouce (dun pouce et demi?) en longueur,
il a pas obsery6 de difference entre leur d6viations ; ce qui ferait penser que
les deux corrections dont nous parlons, dont Fune a pour effet Caugmenter la
deviation, et Vautre, de la diminuer, se seraient A peu pres compens6es. Mais
nous avons lieu de croire que cette compensation a 6t6 tres-imparfaite ; car en
calculant les d6viations de Taiguille, sans ayoir 6gard a la double corrections
due A sa longueur et & sa force magndctique, les differences que Ton trouye entre
le calcul et Vexperience, sont trop grandes pour @tre attribu6es en entier aux
erreurs des observations*.”

'These considerations induced me to extend my experiments much beyond
the limits which I had originally proposed to myself ; and as these experiments
were made with great care, and I may fairly state, without any consideration
of what might or might not be in conformity with theoretical views,they will
afford good tests which may be applied to any theory of magnetism, as well as
to the laws with which I have compared them. Previously to detailing any of
these experiments, or to entering upon any investigations founded upon the law
which they 80 decidedly establish, I shall briefly notice the facts which I as-
certained, and the general explanation they afford, in conformity with that law,
of the experiments which are considered by their author to be decisive of its
fallacy. In the first instance, I ascertained that if any bar of steel; uniformly mag-
netized by the method of double touch, have this state of its magnetism dis-
turbed, by drawing the end of a magnet from its centre to the end of the same
