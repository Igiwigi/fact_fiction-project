DR. A. SCHUSTER ON THE SPECTRA OF METALLOIDS. 41

The homogeneousness of the phenomena seen in vacuum tubes is greatly increased, if we
consider the one line spectrum of oxygen as the representative of the band spectrum of
nitrogen, and I shall therefore consider ib as 8uch. I have called the spectrum the
compound line spectrum of oxygen, because, according to the theory of molecular com-
bination, it would be due to a more complicated molecular structure than the other
(the elementary) line spectrum. I must, however, add that I do not at all feel certain
that the two line spectra are necessarily to be explained the same way as the line and
band s8pectra. I have found ib necessary, for the sake of clearness, to explain the
results of the investigation in the language of a definite theory. It will be easy for
any one to separate the two. The fact that nearly all lines which make their appear-
ance at low temperatures only are lines which widen easily seems to be suggestive.

Spectra of the negative pole. â€”It has long been known that in many gases the glow
surrounding the negative electrode has a different colour from the remainder of the
discharge. This colour appears generally more blue to the eye than that of the posi-
tive discharge, and, this fact was the cause that a certain blueness was often ass0ciated
with the idea of negative electricity. When examined with the spectroscope, it is
found that the negative glow has a s8pectrum of its own, different, of course, in different
gases. Here, also, I think, it will be found simpler to assume that a definite molecular
combination is formed at the negative pole than to suppose that exterior forces pecu-
liar to the pole modify the period of vibration, The following experiments seem to me
to support strongly, if not to prove, this view. When the pressure is very small, the
