theory as a functor .&/ : LocSre > Alg.

The definition of the morphisms ./(y) seems almost an afterthought, but it is actually crucial
to the definition of the theory. Indeed, the algebras by themselves do not really specify the
theory at all. To see this, fix a background (M, J) and also choose a particular real-valued solution


¢ € C™(M) to the classical equation of motion. Now define a map xg :./(M, J) > /(M,0) by

Koop (= Pano) + ({, fod vol) Lesans) (2)

and «1.(m,J) =1<(m0). One may check that this map on generators is compatible with the
relations of the two algebras! and therefore extends to a morphism in Alg; in fact, it is an
isomorphism, with inverse defined on generators by

Ke Po (f) = Pann f) — (Rc d vol) Lemp:

As the algebras </(M,J) and «/(M,0) are isomorphic, they carry no specific information about
the background source J.2 Note, however, that xs depends on the special choice of a particular

solution ¢, and there is no canonical way of choosing such a solution in a general background. : =

Developing this point a bit further, let 4 ¢R and define a functor %, : LocSrc — LocSrc so that : >
246(M,]J)=(M,AJ) and so that, if w:(M,J)—> (M’,J'), then 4%(w):(M,AaJ) > (M’,AJ') has the [3
same underlying map as yy. Then the functor 4 := .o/ o %, : LocStc—> Alg is a new theory, which : =
