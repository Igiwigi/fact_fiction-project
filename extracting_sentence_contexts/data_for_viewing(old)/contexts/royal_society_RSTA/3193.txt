0, H"(comax) <0) and decreases for comax <¢< Comin to a local minimum value at c=comin
(H'(comin) =9, H’(comin) > 0) and then starts increasing again. As ¢ tends to zero, we have
Comax — 1, Co,min — Co, and the local maximum value H(co max) tends to infinity. This is illustrated
in figure 3a.

The regularization also allows to analyse the spectral stability of the solitary travelling wave
solutions using the two approaches described in §§3-5, co-travelling steady-state eigenvalue
analysis and calculation of Floquet multipliers for periodic orbits (modulo shift). Figure 3
showcases the power of the stability criterion and illustrates the complementary nature of the
two approaches. For the parameter values ¢ = 0.25, x = 4 and r¢ = 1, we have co, max = 1.00546 and
Comin = 1.0497 such that H’(c) <0 for comax <¢ < Comin, and H’(c) > 0 otherwise. In the velocity
interval (co,max, CO,min), an eigenvalue of the operator L crosses through A = 0 into the positive real
axis (dots in figure 3b), indicating instability. In fact, it can be shown [22] that the stability problem
in the co-travelling frame also possesses eigenvalues A + i(27j), where j € Z, as demonstrated in
figure 4a. Note that the finite domain nature of the computation leads to a number of spurious
