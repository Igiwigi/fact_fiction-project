They include
respiration ; circulation ; those processes by which the secreted fluids are formed ;
those, namely the more immediately assimilating processes, by which our food is con-
verted into the various organs of our bodies, and such parts of them as have become
unfit for the purposes of life are separated and expelled, for all are in a state of
change ; and those by which the due temperature is maintained. Does the sensitive cooperate with the vital system in any of these functions ? From the line of distinction, determined by the experiments just referred to, it
appears that in one of them only is there such a cooperation. |

I have in the last of my papers published in the Philosophical Transactions for
1829 considered at length the nature of respiration, and have, as far as I am capable
of judging, adduced such facts as prove that the muscles employed in this function
are, in the full sense of the word, muscles of voluntary motion. The first act in
respiration is the impression made on the sensorium, the sensation excited by the
want of fresh air in the lungs. We are enabled to supply it and remove the uneasi-
ness, by exciting, through the nervous system properly 80 called, certain muscles
snbject to the will.
