These exquisite organs
must not only serve to carry forward the fluid already in the cell, and in which the
vascular tuft is bathed, but must tend to remove pressure from the free surface of
the vessels, and 80 to encourage the escape of their more fluid contents. Why is 80
wonderful an apparatus placed at the extremity of each uriniferous tube, if not to
furnish water, to aid in the separation and solution of the urinous products from the
epithelium of the tube ? Many recently discovered facts* conspire to prove that secretion is a function very
nearly allied to ordinary growth and nutrition ; that whereas growth and nutrition
comprehend two functions, assimilation of new particles and rejection of old, the old
being reconveyed into the blood, so secretion consists in a corresponding assimilation
and rejection, and only differs in the old particles being at once thrown off from the
system, without re-entering the blood. According to this view, all effete material
received into the blood from the old substance of the various organs, must be reassi-
milated by an organized tissue, specially designed for the purpose, before it can be
