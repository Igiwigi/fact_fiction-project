In such cases, analogy with t
types above described would lead us to look for differences in the nuclei by whi
they might be distinguished. It cannot however be assumed that all forms
Foraminifera are dimorphic.

(b.) The shape and mode of growth of the chambers succeeding the megalosphe
and microsphere. ScHLUMBERGER has called attention to the very interesting fact, that in many
species among the Miliolidee the chambers immediately succeeding the central one
are arranged on the biloculine plan in the megalospheric form, and on the quinquelo-
culine plan in the microspheric form (woodcut, p. 405.)

In several species the second chamber of the megalospheric form is peculiar. Thus,
in Orbitolites, it forms the large circumambient chamber (CARPENTER) which almost
surrounds the primordial chamber (megalosphere); in Cycloclypeus the second
chamber has a similar relation to the megalosphere. In Polystomella it is not s0
large in proportion as in these forms, but it is applied to the megalosphere for the
whole of its length.
