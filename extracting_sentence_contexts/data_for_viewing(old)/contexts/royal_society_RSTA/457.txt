example, taking monthly mean observations of only temperature and salinity in the top 2000m
of the ocean (similar to the Argo array sampling frequency and depth range) was found to
be sufficient to produce skilful forecasts of the AMOC (figure 15b). Initial conditions in the
atmosphere were found to be less important on the decadal forecast time scale, at least in that
model (figure 15c).

The experiments examined so far do not tell us what the key locations are for observations
in order to give us the predictability in the AMOC and hence associated climate impacts. This
question was the subject of further idealized model experiments in [42] where the impact of
removing data in each of the following three regions was assessed in turn: (i) the North Atlantic
subpolar gyre (SPG), (ii) the tropical Atlantic, and (iii) the tropical Pacific (figure 16). In these
experiments, the AMOC was assessed at a latitude of 26 N (the latitude of the RAPID arrayâ€”
discussed later), which is significantly south of the North Atlantic SPG region and in fact on
the edge of the tropical Atlantic region. Figure 16b shows that sustaining AMOC forecast skill
is dependent on initializing the North Atlantic SPG region. This is a nice illustration of the
widely held conceptual model of the AMOC (e.g. [43]) as being driven by density changes in
