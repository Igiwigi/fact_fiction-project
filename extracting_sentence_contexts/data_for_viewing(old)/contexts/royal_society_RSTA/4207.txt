randomness: (i) a loss of coherence between available alternative quantum states that occur upon
measurement and (ii) the assortment of these values over the members of the resulting (initially
pure) ensemble. Schwinger’s theoretical goal in performing the reconstruction discussed here was
to induce the ‘whole new scheme of mathematics,’ namely, that of quantum mechanics ‘developed
by Heisenberg, Born, Schrédinger and others, essentially in the years 1925 to 1929’, something
necessary because fundamental classical mechanical assumptions about the relationship between
measured values and physical properties no longer holds in the quantum realm.

I wish to point out that the failure of these fundamental assumptions means equally well a
failure of the ability to represent physical phenomena in the microscopic realm by numbers
which change in time as we do in the macroscopic or classical domain. Something of an
entirely different mathematical nature is needed, such that it represents, or mimics, the
basic facts of microscopic measurement [15, p. 13].

The result of his effort is ‘a whole new theory of microscopic measurement’, on which a
‘phenomenological’ explication of the quantum kinematics is to be founded.

Schwinger used the terms ‘determinism’ and ‘causality’ involved here with the following
meanings.

By causal, one means essentially that when the state of the system is given at a particular
time—and we must return to precisely what we mean by ‘state’—then the state is
completely determined at any other time; this is what we mean by causality. Causality
is inference in time: given the state of affairs at one time, the state of affairs is uniquely
determined at another time. What makes it deterministic is that the knowledge of the state
