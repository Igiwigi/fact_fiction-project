the pregnant female appears to keep much more closely to the burrow, so that one
may then commonly enough shoot five or six males to one female.

Again, the breeding period appears to be subject to some variation, both as regards
locality and character of season. We have only to a very limited extent been able
to superintend personally the work of collection, and have found it necessary to rely
largely upon the efforts of the scientifically untrained collector in the accumulation of
the material for our investigations. Unfortunately, the material result of the work
of such a collector during an entire season is so meagre that he requires considerable
inducement to carry on the work at all; whilst the product to the investigator may
be practically nil. The genuineness of the difficulty in procuring this kind of material
is sufficiently indicated by the fact that whilst Srmon (’94), in his expedition,
was successful in obtaining a very considerable number of eggs and foetal specimens
of Echidna, his collection of Ornithorhynchus embryos would appear to have been
limited to a small number of early intra-uterine eggs

Our own collection is very far indeed from being complete, though the work of
collection has been going on for quite a number of years.

The expenses of one of us (H.) have been in part defrayed by grants from the
Government Grant Committee of the Royal Society of London, and the work was
in part carried out during his tenure of a “George Heriot ” Research Fellowship in
Zoology, during the years 1899 and 1900.
