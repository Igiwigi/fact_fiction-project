WEIGHT AND SUPPORT IN SHIPS. 421

in the curve W W obtained previously. This I have done in the present case for a length
of about 40 feet in the neighbourhood of one of the armoured bulk-heads, and it has
been found that the curve of weights between the stations & and F'in fig. 3 (Plate XVI.)
assumes the form W'W' W'. The concentrated weights (such as the armoured bulk-head,
the armoured pilot-tower, the engines, and the mainmast) are in the calculations made
for W' W' W' put very nearly into the spaces they really occupy, instead of being spread
over 20-feet spaces as in the curve W W; and a further approximation to accuracy might
be made by taking the planes of division still closer together. In practice, however, this
is quite unnecessary ; and it will be seen from the diagram in fig. 3 that even in this
exceptional case no very considerable error results from taking the curve W W as a fair
Arepresentation of the distribution of the weight. This follows from the fact that the
Seurve W W averages, 0 to speak, the inequalities of W' W' W', and, on the length of 40
Sfeet considered, includes a nearly equal area ; that is, represents as nearly as possible the
S8ame weight. On this account, when considering the strength of a ship as a whole, we

ay avail ourselves safely of the method previously described, taking the planes of divi-
Sion, say, 20 feet apart in large ships; but excessively concentrated weights necessarily
Zeause severe {ocal-bending- and shearing-strains, which must be specially provided against.
St will snffice here to say that shipbuilders depend chiefly upon longitudinal bearers or
-Zkeelsons to distribute such concentrated loads over a considerable length, and prevent
Ztheir exercising a prejudicial effect on the structure.
