represent the base of the chromosphere immediately beneath either of the metallic
prominences considered in Table I. Still the cusp is not far from prominence No. 19,
and it is fair to consider the base of the chromosphere homogeneous. If so, the
prominences cannot be fed from the base of the chromosphere, since they contain
different vapours.

The preliminary discussion of individual substances has further abundantly shown
that although some of the lines belonging to any particular metal may appear as dark
lines in the solar spectrum on account of absorption by the chromosphere, other lines
of the same substance are only represented among the dark lines because of absorption
taking place elsewhere. This again is an indication of the stratification of the sun’s
absorbing atmosphere, which, if it exists, must furnish a very strong argument in
favour of the dissociation of metallic vapours at solar temperatures. In fact, the

eclipse phenomena have been found to be as bizarre, in relation to the non-dissociation
hypothesis, as those which I have already discussed in relation to observation of
sun spots and of the chromosphere and prominences without an eclipse.

The view I expressed in 1879,* and to which I adhere, is therefore strengthened
by the eclipse work. I then wrote: ‘The discrepancy which I pointed out, six
years ago, between the solar and terrestrial spectra of calcium is not an exceptional,
but truly a typical, case. Variations of the same kind stare us in the face when the
