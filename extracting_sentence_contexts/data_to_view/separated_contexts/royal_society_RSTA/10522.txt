As he has only a single set of the latter
left to carry out the identification, his functions (7) and F(7) are not really inde-
pendent. Theoretically only the shear f(7) should be required, and in a practical
problem even this is unknown, the total pressure being all that is given. The actual
distribution of this pressure does not appear to enter into Professor Scuirrâ€™s solution,
Also the fact that the values of 7 are roots of a transcendental equation singularly
complicates the solution from a numerical point of view, and Professor ScHIFF appears
to have made no attempt to translate his results into numbers. |*

It has therefore appeared worth while to apply the solutions involving circular
functions of z to problems such as those sketched above. Of each of these I have given a concrete numerical example. Indeed, the greater
part of the work has been spent on these numerical examples.
