This is because the spherical symmetry for the gauge field involves
the embedding of the radial isotropy group SO(2) into the gauge group that requires the Higgs
field to be invariant under the U(1) subgroup of SU(2). This is possible with a Higgs triplet, but
not with a Higgs doublet [83]. In fact, in the absence of the U(1)y degrees of freedom, the above
ansatz describes the SU(2) sphaleron which is not spherically symmetric [84-86]. To see this, one might try to remove the string in â‚¬ with the U(1) subgroup of SU(2). But this
U(1) will necessarily change 7 and thus violate the spherical symmetry.
