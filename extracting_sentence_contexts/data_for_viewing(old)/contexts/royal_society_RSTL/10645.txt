fissure, penetrating more deeply and dividing the medullary fibres slightly posterior to
this (fig. 144). Further back (figs. 145 and 146) the lesion had destroyed the cortex of
the outer half of the gyrus hippocampi, and completely severed the medullary fibres of the
cornu ammonis, which itself was intact. Still farther back (fig. 147) the cortex of the
gyrus hippocampi was entirely removed externally, and also the cortex of the inferior
temporo-sphenoidal region. The cornu ammonis still remained connected with the
fimbria. At the junction of the posterior and inferior cornua (fig. 148) the lesion gradually
came to an end with destruction of the cortex on each side of the collateral fissure, and
partial lesion of the medullary fibres of the base of the cornu ammonis.

Remarks. â€”This case, like the two former, was again unsuccessful 80 far as related
to the opportunities of continued observation. But it again demonstrates the
important fact that destructive lesions implicating only the inferior temporo-sphenoidal
and hippocampal region cause profound impairment of tactile sensibility, in all its
forms, without any motor paralysis whatever.

In this case also there was no appreciable impairment of vision due to the com-
paratively slight, if any, injury to the occipito-angular region. Hearing also was
unimpaired, aud as before, the superior temporo-sphenoidal convolution was entirely
free from lesjon.
