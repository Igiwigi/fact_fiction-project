in Anomia laqueata there is a somewhat similar membrane depending from the axis
between the two descending lamelle. In Anomia patelliformis the smaller ciliated
dises ate situated at three or four levels in each lamella, in Anomia laqueata there
are but two or three rows (fig. 9C). The transverse sections of the filaments resemble
those of Anomia ephippium, unless, of course, the section passes through a ciliated

Anomia laqueata.

The fact that in the genus Anomia there are three distinct types of gill structure
exemplified by Anomia aculeata, A. laqueata and A. ephippium, suggests that some
division into sub-genera is demanded. It was foreign to the purpose of the present

inquiry to make an exhaustive study of the general anatomy of the various species,
and the material available was not adequate for the purpose ; but it may be pointed
out that there are other features besides those of the gills, which suggest that a
revision of the genus is desirable. The muscle impressions in the imperforate valve
of the shell, for instance, are three in number in Anomia ephippiwm, whereas in
Anomia patelliformis there is a single impression incompletely divided into two.
