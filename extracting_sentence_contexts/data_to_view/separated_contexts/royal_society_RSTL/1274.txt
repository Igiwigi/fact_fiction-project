I am making preparations for performing the experiment
in a bored'tube made from'a single- piece of platina, and like-
wise in tubes made of other metals, and I hope to be able, in
a-short time, to. have the honour of laying the results before
the Society. I shall make no apology for bringing forward the investi-
gation in its present imperfect state, except by stating that my

motive for 80 doing, is the desire of being assisted- or-cor-
rected by the opinions and advice of the learned chemical phi-
losophers belonging to this illustrious body... In an investiga-
tion connected with almost all the theoretical arrangements of
chemistry, and. in, operations 'of 's0, much delicacy, it will, I
conceive, be allowed, that. it is, scarcely possible to proceed
with too much caution, or to multiply facts. to. too! great an
extent. The different phenomena presented by the processes of dis-
tillation. in different metallic tubes, may lead to new explana-
tions of this intricate subject, and though the facts cannot be
easily accounted for, except on the supposition that nitrogene
is an oxide, yet till the proportions and weights are distinctly
ascertained, the inquiry cannot. be considered as far advanced,
for in an experiment, in which the processes are 80 compli-
cated and delicate, and in which the data are. 80 numerous, it
is not easy to be satisfied that every source of error has been
avoided, and that every circumstance has been examined-and
reasoned upon. All conclusions. on the action of potassium.on ammonia, are
immediately dependent upon the results of the electrical ana-
lysis of the volatile alkali..
