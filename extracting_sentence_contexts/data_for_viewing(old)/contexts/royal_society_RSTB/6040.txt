connected merely with the posterior margin of the ectoderm as appears to be the case
in Tarsius 86, it is now seen to be in direct proliferative continuity with its under
surface, over an area roughly corresponding in extent with the marginal thickening
in blastocyst 86. Clearly we have to do here with a very short primitive streak
(actually about 0-1 mm. in length) which by its proliferative activity has given origin
to the mesoderm which extends back to join the exoccelomic mesoderm.

Further, I think we may conclude with reasonable certainty that Husrecut’s “ proto-
chordal wedge ” in Tarsius 86 is not Hensen’s knot but none other than a primitive
streak thickening, probably less developed than in Tarsius 235 but still sufficiently
active to have given origin to a relatively slender mesodermal connecting strand. The
serial sections through Tarsius 86 are definitely oblique to the antero-posterior axis of
the embryonal area, a fact which possibly accounts for the apparent exclusively marginal

origin of the mesoderm in the section figured by Husrecut ; very probably, if a median
reconstruction of the area were made, it would be found to resemble that of Tarsius 235.

Text-Fic. 8.—Semidiagrammatic view of blastocyst of Tarsius 235. Blastocyst, 0-53 mm. transverse
diameter. Embryonal ectoderm, 0-235 mm. in diameter. Lettering as in text-fig. 7.

It is evident, then, that in Tarsius, not only are the extra-embryonal mesoderm and
ccelom precociously formed but the like holds true for the primitive streak. In respect
