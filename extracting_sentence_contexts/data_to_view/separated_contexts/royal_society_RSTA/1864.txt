The Origin of Species had some precedents but it was not embedded in a
continuous, well-developed chain of progress in the same fashion as the periodic table. It was a
new beginning and Darwin can be credited with giving birth to a new discipline. The facts that preceded the discovery of the periodic table were the discovery of 63 of the
elements, their physical characterization, including the estimation of their atomic weights, and
the finding that there were patterns in which elements reacted with one another and they did so
in regular proportionsâ€”e.g. two volumes of hydrogen reacted with one of oxygen. Sometimes
elements that were very different in atomic weight, such as carbon and silicon, were very similar
in the way they reacted with other elements, leading to earlier proposals for the existence of
groups of elements with similar chemical properties [1]. Dimitri Mendeleev was writing a textbook on chemistry when he sought some organizing
principles for these facts.
