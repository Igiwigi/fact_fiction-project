how the potential (V) and kinetic (T) energy vary in the course of a given physical process,
while the sum of both, represented by the Hamiltonian, H, remains constant. This tracking is
equally possible in quantum mechanics and then quantum field theory, now without, because of
the uncertainty relations, a possibility of tracking or even defining the trajectories of quantum
objects themselves. By the same token, both the Hamiltonian (H =T + V) and the Lagrangian
(L=T — V) are defined, in the operator formalism, for a given quantum system in the absence
of causality and realism, even conceptual, let alone visualizable, realism. As was realized even
before quantum mechanics was discovered, the laws of energy and momentum conservation do
not depend on causality even in classical physics. As Bohr noted, ‘the great fruitfulness of [the


laws of the conservation of energy and momentum], already in classical physics, depends upon
the fact that one may extensively apply them without following the course of the phenomena [the
course of the processes resulting in the appearance of phenomena?] in space and time’ [12, vol. 1,
p- 94]. The proof of energy conservation, again, shared with classical physics, was a major early
achievement of matrix mechanics and a crucial testimony to its viability.

Also, the integral of the Lagrangian is the action, S, which, while of course continuous in
classical mechanics, is measured in the same units as Planck’s constant, h, fittingly (indeed for
this very reason) called by Planck ‘the quantum of action’, now also made discrete, rather than
continuous as in classical physics. Hamilton’s principle of minimal action is fully retained in
quantum theory as well and was used by Schrédinger in his derivation of his equation. He also
used, in this derivation, via F. Klein, the mechanical-optical analogy in a reverse parallel with
Hamilton’s optical-mechanical analogy used by Hamilton [36, pp. 161-171].
