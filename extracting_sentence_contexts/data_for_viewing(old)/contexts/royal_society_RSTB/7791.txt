MateriAt. Zinda Pir section: Upper Chocolate Clays (upper part, local zone 14) (FB.
F. 2517, the holotype, Reg. No. L. 80379).

Description. Shell subtriangular in outline, not very high, and with a submedian umbo
which is apparently rather broad. Valve not seeming to have been strongly inflated, but
this appearance of moderate inflation may be due to the fact that it is preserved on a shale
surface and has been somewhat compressed. Antero-dorsal margin moderately long,
slightly convex, moderately steeply descendent. Anterior end narrowly rounded, situated
rather low down. Ventral margin gently convex. Posterior end rostrate, bluntly pointed,
situated very low down. Postero-dorsal margin very similar to the antero-dorsal margin
but less convex, being straight in its median and distal portions. Ornament consisting of
moderately coarse concentric folds which increase slowly and regularly in size and of about
the same width as their intervals; there are 4 in } mm.

Dimensions. Holotype: length 8-25 mm.; height 5-25 mm.

Remarks. The solitary specimen is a poorly preserved left valve the characters of which
do not seem to agree with those of any of the known species from India or Pakistan, or with
