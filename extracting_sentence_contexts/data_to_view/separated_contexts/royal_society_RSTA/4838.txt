However, it is now clear that the picture
is more complex than this simple classification would suggest. The recent understanding is : =
summarized in review articles (e.g. [3,4]), with loop heating also reviewed by, for example, 3
Reale [6]. 12

Although there is still no consensus on which mechanism is responsible for heating the solar nee)
atmosphere, a few simple but relevant ‘facts’ are now supported by a strong body of observational :
evidence (see also the reviews by Klimchuk [7] and Schmelz & Winebarger [8]): ne]

— there is reconnection in the corona and magnetic reconnection can dissipate stored [sz
magnetic energy; x
— there are many wave modes in the corona (but their actual contribution to coronal heating .
is still unclear);
— the solar corona cannot be treated in isolation but should be seen as part of the complex,
coupled solar atmosphere (including the chromosphere); and
— coronal heating is intrinsically non-steady. The complexity of the solar atmosphere and the wide range of both spatial and temporal
scales on which physical processes are observed to occur mean that beyond the above list of
fairly simple facts, much is either not known or not agreed (e.g. Klimchuk’s review [7]). There
is, however, increasing consensus that ‘the’ coronal heating mechanism is unlikely to exist, but
rather coronal heating is due to different mechanisms in different places and/or at different times.
