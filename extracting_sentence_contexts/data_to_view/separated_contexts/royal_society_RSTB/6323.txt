The increase in percentage infection with time on healthy plant might also be
explained, if in some aphids the virus circulates more slowly than in others, but this
should not influence percentage infection after long periods on the infected plant. Another possibility is that the susceptibility of the plant tissues increases as the result
of continuous injury by penetration of the stylets into increasing numbers of cells. 5â€”Consecutive Infection

The fact that aphids are capable of infecting two consecutive healthy plants
without intermediate access to a source of infection makes it extremely doubtful
that infection is caused by contamination from the outside of the stylets as HoGGAN
(1933) and several other workers have suggested. This is in agreement with the
conclusions from previous experiments on artificial feeding of Myzus persicae
(Hamivton, 1935). There seems to besome disparity between the consecutive infection results for Hy.
