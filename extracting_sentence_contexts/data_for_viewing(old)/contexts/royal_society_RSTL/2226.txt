position of a substance may be determined by simply ascer-
taining the quantity of carbonic acid gas yielded by a known
quantity of it; while in the other two, the same can be readily

excess or diminution of the original bulk of the oxygen gas
employed. Such are the simple and universally admitted

amount of :03 gr. though often much less than this. I was a good deal puzzled to
account for this anomaly at first, but believe that it arose chiefly from the reoxy-

other singular facts connected with this subject, which will be noticed when we
come to speak of the analysis of substances containing azote.
