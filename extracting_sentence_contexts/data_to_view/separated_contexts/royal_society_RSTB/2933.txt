J. EWART ON THE ASCENT OF WATER IN TREES. 47

section of 0°068 sq. centim.; hence, with a rate of flow of 50 centims. per hour,
3'4 cub. centims. per hour should escape. This discrepancy is partly due to the fact
that the rate of flow observed is the maximal and not the average one, partly to
the fact that all the vessels are not equally active, and partly owing to the presence
of air in them. The result indicates, however, that the part played by the tracheides
and wood fibres in water transport is small. From Porsrurnir’s formula it was found that at 20° C., under a head of 3 metres
of water, 384 cub. centims. per hour should escape from 3400 vessels 25 centims.
