Tn connexion with the discussions of the expressions for the internal energy of the
material media it may be worth while emphasising the significance of the various
terms in the expression for the forcive on the polarised material elements derived in
the previous paragraph, especially the way in which the various terms arise and their
dependence on the term

Curl [P»,, |

in the complete current. Further, we may notice how the complete expression for the
change of intrinsic energy per unit volume, viz.,

(E+2[., Bl 9)

is derived, the latter term being due to the above-mentioned term in the current.

This last remark points to the possibility of obtaining an elementary deduction of
the expression

E+ a [ms B]

for the complete electromotive forcive simply by calculating »the rate of change of
intrinsic energy of a moving bi-pole, and the calculation has in fact been carried out
by Larmor,* taking however a parallel plate condenser with equal and oppositely
charged plates, moving in a uniform magnetic field. An’analogous argument in the magnetic case will give a deduction of the magneto-
motive forcive |
