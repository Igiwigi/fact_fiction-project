This would
not be of the least consequence, however, since any ordinate of the curye V V simply_
shows the amount of the shearing-force at that station; and the question of direction.
is immaterial, as the same effect is produced whether the part before the station moves.
upward or downward relatively to that abaft it. There are one or two features of interest in the curye V V, Plate XVII. fig. 9, to which
brief reference may be made before passing on. Its ordinates have continually increasing
negative values between A and the foremost, water-borne section R', while beyond that
section they gradually decrease (on account of the fact that the curve of loads has
crossxed the axis A B, and has part of its area above as well as part below that line)
until at the station « a they pass through a zero value, the area of the part of the curye
of loads below the axis being there equal to the area of the part aboye the axis. The
section @ a therefore divides the ship in 8wch a manner as to render each of the parts
before and abaft it separately water-borne, and I shall in my future remarks term 8uch
sections © sections of water-borne division” *. At the sections þ and cc there are two other
zero valnes of the shearing-force; each of these is also a section of water-borne division,
and in passing through them the shearing-force changes sign.
