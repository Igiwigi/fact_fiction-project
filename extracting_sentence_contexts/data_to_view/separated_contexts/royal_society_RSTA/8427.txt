Some information will be found on page 351. It is seen that the first two terms in these equations are much more important than
the following terms, that is to say, the naturalized wind V at any level can be expressed
nearly in terms of § and d/dL at the same level. This unexpected fact simplifies the
observer’s work. Finally, to test the error due to the number of layers not being infinite, we may repeat
the process with layers of a different thickness. Thus, for layers three times as thick
it is found in a similar way, that

Vo-¢ = —1°340B,-2,

V,.5 = —1°602£8,., + 0°6298,...
