The object
represented in figs. 125 and 126.—met with incidentally—was in a much more ad-
vanced state as to form, and exhibited an incipient division into further forms (par.
218.); yet it presented no trace of separation into tissxues. The origin of tissues, then,
is subordinate to a division into forms. This may serve to elucidate the fact, that parts
in different animals, having a general resemblance in form, are sometimes the seat of
very different functions. And if the primordial germs of organized beings in general
resemble one another in appearance, as much as, from my observations, it appears
that they do in some instances very remote from one another, it is not surprising that
there exist resemblances in the subsequent forms of beings more nearly allied. I
refer, for example, to a curious resemblance between the mammiferous germ with its
vesicle—as exhibited in Plate VI. fig. 113.—and the © eytoblast” and spore of a cryp-
togamous plant (Rhizina levigata),—as figured by SCHLEIDEN in his paper on vege-
table structureh.
