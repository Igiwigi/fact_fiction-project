The foregoing quantities (>z, 3y, . . .) are termed the increments.

66. Consider a k-fold relation between the m+1T coordinates (, y, ...), &  m; the
increments (3, 3y, . . .) are connected by a linear -fold relation. The linear /-fold relation is satisfied if we assume the increments proportional to the
coordinatesâ€”this is, in fact, assuming that the point remains unaltered, We may write
(3x, dy, . . .)=(x, y, - - -), 8ince in such an equation only the ratios are attended to. But it
may be preferable to write (3z, 3y, . ..)
