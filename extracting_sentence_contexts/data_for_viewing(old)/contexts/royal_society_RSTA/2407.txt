and converting the delays to the fast time gives the sufficient condition for oscillations Tj + Tg >
max(TE™ + Tk, T™)/e * 27.7. In our simulations, we observed oscillations for Tj + Tg > 5.1. For
the parameter values of figure 8, we obtained the condition Tj + Tz > (TE + Tk + a + Ty)/e J
54.7. In our simulations we observed oscillations for Tj + Tg > 37.6. Clearly our estimates are
conservative. This is not surprising since our analysis is based on the worst-case analysis for
the various cases of the trajectories.

Note that the periods and activation times are as predicted by table 2 after converting these
to the fast time. In both figures, Tj, = Tz + 7j, the total delay. In Figure 7 Ty =Te+ T+ Ty >Th
and the period is longer than 2(7z + Jj), while in figure 8 Ty =Te+ 7 -— Ty < Tj, and the period is
shorter than 2(7z + Jj). The period of the oscillation increases as the total delay is increased within
the range where the stable oscillation exists. Although from table 2, it would appear the period
depends linearly on the total delay, in fact, the times TE, Th, Ty, Ty can depend on the delay, so
other than case (1,1) the dependence is nonlinear.

In all simulations, the two E-cells (red and green curves) quickly synchronize on the periodic
orbit. Further, as predicted by corollary 3.5 identical periodic orbits with different phase difference
between the E- and J-cells occur for different values of 7 and Tg with the same total delay. As
noted in remark 3.6, the phase difference between the two populations is determined simply by
the size of the excitatory synaptic delay, Tg. Figure 7d and figure 8d show that an equilibrium
point corresponding to the quiescent state coexists with the periodic orbit.
