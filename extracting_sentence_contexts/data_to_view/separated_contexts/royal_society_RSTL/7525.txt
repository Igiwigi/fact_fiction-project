fig. 4) it often appears to be interrupted, —the fracture
or section not having happened to lay open the apertures or passages of connexion. And
further, I have been enabled to satisfy myself, by the use of adequate magnifying power,
that notwithstanding the smooth shelly aspect which the walls of the *radial tubes' often
present, they are in reality built up, like the lamellz between which they pass, of aggre-
gated sand-grains,—a fact which may be regarded as justifying the like interpretation of
the appearance presented by the snbstance of the Nucleus ($ 10). 16. When a sufficiently high magnifying-power is applied to transparent sections
thin enough to bear it, s0 as to bring into view the forms of the individual sand-
grains and the mode of their aggregation, a curious diyersity is observable as to both
these particulars between different individuals.
