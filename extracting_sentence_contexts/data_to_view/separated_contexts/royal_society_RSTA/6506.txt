After discussing TPs and TP-generating
mechanisms from these perspectives, we revisit the competing mechanisms of TPs and PI and
argue that this dichotomy has in the past been overblown. Both mechanisms have their place and
roles to fill in developmental biology; often, indeed, they may be required simultaneously [8]. Furthermore, at a deeper mathematical level we can also show that mathematical models of these
two mechanisms are in fact closely related.

2. Turing-pattern mechanism

Turing’s original mechanism involves two morphogens, A and B, which act as illustrated in
figure 1a: local activation (of A by itself, and of B by A via diffusion), followed by lateral inhibition
(of A by B, again via diffusion).

Figure 1. Representations and manifestations of Turing patterns. (a) The Gierer—Meinhardt model is one of the most widely [SS
studied systems producing Turing patterns, and it embodies the local auto-activation and lateral inhibition mechanisms that DN
are the hallmarks of the majority of Turing-pattern mechanisms. (b) An example of a Turing pattern produced by the Gierer— :8
Meinhardt system; here the two morphogen patterns are in phase, which means the areas of high and low concentrations of 28
both morphogens coincide. (c) Patterns on snail and sea shells are one of the classical examples of Turing patterns in nature.
