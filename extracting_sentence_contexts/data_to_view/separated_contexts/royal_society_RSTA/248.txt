But this can, and often does, seriously misrepresent the state of the scientific
evidence, where ‘one team’ is the consensus view of the science community and the
‘other team’ is a tiny minority. For example, consider the debate about whether
HIV causes AIDS. A research community of order 100 000 has by now established
this as a fact. But a small travelling roadshow, including one Nobel Laureate, can
still be assembled to deny it. And there are many other examples: from MMR
vaccination in the UK to the essential reality of anthropogenic climate change
(albeit with remaining uncertainties about the timescales and magnitudes of some
nonlinear processes).
