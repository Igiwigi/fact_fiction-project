that the column-averaged Hj temperature is higher in those regions, a direct response of the
peak altitude of the H} layer being shifted towards higher altitudes, as seen in figure 6e. This
is primarily an SZA effect, as more oblique slant paths through the atmosphere generate higher-
altitude photoionization; however, there is also a slight offset post-noon due partly to conversion
of Ht to Hy (and thus, Hj, following reaction with H2) via reaction (2.1). The Hy lifetime at
the H} peak is on the order of ~ 1h for most of the Uranus day, as would be expected based on
the modelled peak density (approx. 3000 cm~%) and dissociative recombination rate of Hy with
electrons (approx. 10-7 cm? s~! [70)]). Column-averaged Hy lifetimes, weighted by Hy density,
are slightly higher than at the peak altitude, but still typically less than 3h (figure 6f).

Owing to the simplified nature of the Uranus simulations, and owing to the sparse
thermospheric constraints at present, a detailed model-data comparison is not warranted here.
Instead, we emphasize the temperature variations shown in figure 6d. Despite the fact that the
thermospheric temperature profile is identical at all latitudes, retrieved H} temperatures vary by
greater than 35K, or roughly 5% of the mean temperature. This is simply understood as primarily
a SZA effect: at low SZAs the H} layer is lower in the ionosphere, probing the lower temperatures
there, whereas the reverse is true for high SZAs. This result is, again, not surprising; however, it
highlights two important points: (1) observed H} temperature variations do not necessarily imply
anything about the energetics of the thermosphere, and (2) these SZA effects should be accounted
for when interpreting measured temperature variabilities. Finally, in reviewing the results of
