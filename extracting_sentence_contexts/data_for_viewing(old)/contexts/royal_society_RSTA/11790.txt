Introduction.

One of the most important branches of the theory of integral equations is connected
with the problem of representing a function as a series of normal functions,
Hinsert™ and Scumipr,t who made the earliest contributions, have been able to
obtain sufficient conditions under which an assigned function may be expanded in
terms of a system of normal functions belonging to a symmetric characteristic
function (tern). These conditions are narrow in respect to the nature of the function
which may be expanded, but they have the advantage of applying to very general
systems of normal functions. They apply, in particular, to the expansion of a function
in both the sine and cosine series of Fourrer. It is in the light of our knowledge of
the properties of the latter series that the narrowness above referred to becomes
evident. In point of fact, the Hilbert-Schmidt theory is only applicable to Fourrer’s
series corresponding to a function which has a continuous second differential coefticient
in (0, 7), and which furthermore satisfies certain boundary conditions at the end
points of the interval. For example, in the case of the sine series, the function must
vanish at both end points. It would appear, therefore, that the wide generality as
to the system of normal functions is obtained at the cost of the generality of the
function which it is desired to represent.

Later memoirs by Kyeser and Hopson} have made it abundantly clear that, by
restricting the nature of the system of normal functions, results may be obtained in
regard to the representation of very much wider classes of functions than were
