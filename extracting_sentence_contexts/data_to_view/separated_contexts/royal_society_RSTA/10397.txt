As a fact the first five or six values need not be computed because the early values
of the functions to be integrated are practically zero. The ordinary formule of

quadratures are inappropriate for these integrations, because the function, say U,, to
be integrated increases so very rapidly. I therefore take an empirical and integrable
function, say v,, which is such that 0,5 = wo, Yj, = %,; the quadratures may then be
applied to w%,—v,, and the result applied as a correction to [vd In fact this
correction is always very small, and we might well be satisfied to use |v dy, which is
very easy to calculate. The empirical function v is given by
