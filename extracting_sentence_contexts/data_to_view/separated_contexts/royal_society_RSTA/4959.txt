He obtained the
same result with one part of CO2 in seven parts of the mixture. He concluded that this effect was
attributable to the cooling of the flame by this admixture of an ‘inert’ gas. Equipped with all of these fundamental, experimental facts, Davy possessed sufficient
evidence to design his first safety lamp in which, by admitting only a limited supply of air to an oil
burner, in a closed lantern, the amount of CO? and N2 would be sufficient to prevent an explosion
