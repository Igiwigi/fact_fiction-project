blood-vessels, and hence it was probable that the paralysis of the corresponding parts of
the retina was produced by their pressure. This opinion might have long remained
merely a reasonable explanation of hemiopsy, had not a phenomenon presented itself to
me which places it beyond a doubt. When I had a rather severe attack, which never
took place unless T had been reading for a long time the small print of the © Times”
newspaper, and which was never accompanied either with headache or gastric irritation,
I went accidentally into a dark room, when I was surprised to observe that all the parts
of the retina which were affected were slightly luminous, an effect invariably produced
by pressure upon that membrane. If these views be correct, hemiopsy cannot be regarded
as a case of amaurosis, or in any way connected, as has been supposed, with cerebral
disturbance.”

*'The two great facts of hemiopsy in both eyes, and of what is called single vision with
two eyes, do not require the hypothesis of semidecussation to explain them. If hemiopsy
is produced by the distended blood-yessels of the retina, these vessels must be similarly
distributed in each eye, and similarly affected by any change in the system ; and conse-
quently must produce the same effect upon each retina, and upon the same part of it.”

® Under this term Bzzwsrer appears to have confounded what are now called the © optic disk ” and the
* yellow spot.” For when he localizes the first beginning of the affection © to the right or left hand of the
foramen centrale,” he certainly means the centre of vision, as also below when he speaks of yision being perfect
at tho foramen centrale: yet when he afterwards speaks of the parts affected extending from tho foramen
centrale to the margin of the retina, © as if they were related to the distribution of its blood-vessels,” he is
certainly thinking of the optic disk, the punctum cecum, whence the yessels radiate over the retina,
