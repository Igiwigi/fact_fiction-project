As was discussed in §2,
the TAO/TRITON array is the key component of the ocean observing system for ENSO. It should
be a concern then that the TAO/TRITON array has suffered considerable degradation recently
and many of the 70 moored buoys are no longer returning data. In fact, as at the start of October
2013, I believe the array has not been serviced for 18 months. This is linked to budget cuts facing
NOAA that are placing harsh constraints on the ship-time needed for servicing the array. This is
a stark illustration that sustaining even the most demonstrably useful ocean observations is not
immune to political and financial pressures.

(c) Challenges for improving the representation of ocean—atmosphere coupling and the
need for better estimates of air—sea fluxes

An interesting result from the GloSea5 seasonal hindcast experiments is that the model ocean
does not seem to drive the model atmosphere with the same strength as that in the real world.
