Short rows of such closely-placed centres
produce the elliptical appearance represented in fig. 294. The application of higher
magnifying power, however, shows that the elliptical centre is in reality a combination
of centres, It follows that the ridges on opposite surfaces of the septum in Goniastraa
are structurally composed of several very small, uniformly-developed trabeculse
(cf. fig. 18D). Correlated with the small size of the trabeculz is the fact that the granulations on
the ridges seldom correspond to a fuscicle of fibres emerging from a single trabecula ;
they usually represent the coalesced fascicles passing out from the ridge-series of
trabecule. Examples of small and large granulations can be studied in the accom-
panying sections. Transverse sections of the septal pali offer nothing different from the septa.
