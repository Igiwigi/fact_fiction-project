For instance, magnetic reconnection
can be inferred from the existence of large-scale dynamo activity inside stellar interiors [17,18]. We
would argue that it is also required to enable the eddy-type motions in magnetohydrodynamic
(MHD) turbulence, e.g. in the Goldreich & Sridhar turbulence [19]. In fact, it is easy to show that
without fast magnetic reconnection, magnetized fluids would behave like Jello or felt, rather than
as a fluid. It is clear that solar flares [20] are just one vivid example of reconnection activity. Other
dramatic reconnection events attributed to reconnection include y-ray bursts (see [21] for a
review), while reconnection routinely takes place essentially everywhere both in collisional and
collisionless magnetized plasmas.
