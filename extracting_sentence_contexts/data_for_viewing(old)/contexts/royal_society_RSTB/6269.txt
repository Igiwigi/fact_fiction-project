ovulation occurs spontaneously, that non-pregnant animals with corpora lutea in
the ovaries were not found. This and the occurrence of non-pregnant lactating
animals without corpora lutea in the ovaries, since such animals presumably had a
post-partum oestrus, suggests that ovulation may not be spontaneous.

The high rate of fertility, which results apparently in copulation being followed
by pregnancy in 100%, of cases, accounts for the fact that no pseudo-pregnant
animals, with the possible but very doubtful exception of S. 4, were obtained. The
absence of such animals, however, clearly does not provide evidence that sterile
copulation would not result in pseudo-pregnancy, but merely indicates that sterile
copulation is extremely rare.

The fact that only 3 animals in post-partum cestrus were obtained as compared
to 53 parous pregnant animals, a ratio of 1 : 18, suggests that the duration of the
post-partum oestrus is approximately 1/18th of the period of gestation.

b. Pregnancy

(i) Passage of ova through the Fallopian tubes—The early development of the shrew
has been described by Husrecur (1890), but the earliest stages (Cat. No. 16) which
he obtained were blastocysts free in the uterus. Since, in the present work, 18
animals with tubal ova were available it seems desirable to outline their passage
through the tubes. The first polar spindle is formed in the ovum before ovulation.
