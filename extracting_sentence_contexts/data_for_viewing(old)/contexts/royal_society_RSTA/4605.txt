ejection velocity. The plunging of the ejecta curtain on the water surface generates the
first wave signal that propagates away from the crater, the so-called rim wave (figure 1
IIIb-Vb). The amount of water displaced by this process may be comparable to the
amount of water in a circular trough that reaches down to about one-third of the transient
crater depth, the so-called excavation depth. As a rough estimate, the total ejected mass
corresponds to one-quarter of the total mass displaced from the transient crater.

(2) The collapse of the transient crater by centripetal infill of the crater from the adjacent
ocean (figure 1 Ila) results in the formation of a central peak or jet of water reaching
far above the pre-impact surface (figure 1 IIa). This vertical jet at the centre of the
transient crater is generated by the same mechanism that causes a splash after a stone
falls into water. The gravitational collapse of the central jet generates another wave,
the so-called collapse wave (figure 1 IVa). In fact, the formation of the central jet and
subsequent collapse may repeat several times (figure 1 IVaâ€”VIa), and a train of collapse
waves is formed [25]. Note that the first signal originating from the collapse is a wave
trough (figure 1 IVa), because of the inward directed flow field, and it may cancel out
the first signal of the rim wave. The amount of water displaced by this process may be
comparable to the total mass displaced from the transient crater (see [28,29] for simple
analytic estimates of the size of the transient crater relative to the kinetic energy of
the impactor).


The formation of the rim and collapse waves strongly depends on the ratio between the water
depth and the size of the transient crater. In so-called shallow-water impacts (figure 1 Ib-VIb),
where the diameter of the impactor is comparable to the depth of the water, the effect on crater
