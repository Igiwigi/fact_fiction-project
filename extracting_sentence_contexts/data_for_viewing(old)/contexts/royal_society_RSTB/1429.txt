Lastly, we have the largest specimen, figured in transverse section by Wir

The primary xylem in this specimen has exactly the same structure

36 elements, agrees in every respect with that of the less advanced sp acti

In fact, if the more central portion of the largest specimen were seen alone

which still retain the typical cortex of a Sphenophyllum.
In the most advanced specimens the primary cortex has, as we shoul
entirely disappeared ; it is replaced by an enormously thick bark, formed |
sive layers of internal periderm (see Plate 84, figs. 48, 51, and 52).
We maintain, then, that there is no longer the slightest reason to doubt t
largest, as well as the smallest, specimens under consideration belong to one
same species, namely, to that species of the genus Sphenophyllum to which

The sections in which no primary cortex is shown would, by themselves, st
