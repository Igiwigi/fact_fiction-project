Then after the lapse of some hours its
ï¬†ate was found reversed, being concentrated in parts where it had been diffused, and
vice vers4. These curious variations continued till s0 late as the tenth day after ampus
tation, becoming more frequent after the first few days ; 80 that sometimes a considerable
alteration was observable within half an hour. These facts appeared to me of great importance, as proving the continuance of vital
actions for a much longer time than had been previously supposed possible in a severed
portion of the body. They seem also valuable with reference to the influence of the
nervous system over the pigmentary functions ; for the circumstance that considerable

patches of the web usually had the pigment in the same condition throughout at one
time implies that a large number of pigment-cells were acting in concert, and therefore
probably under the control of the nervous system, although, as the leg' had been ampu
tated, they were of course freed from the influence of the central ganglia. Hence we are
led to suspect the existence in the limb of an apparatus, probably ganglionic in struC-
ture, coordinating the actions of the pigment-cells, just as we know that the muscuJar
contractions in the mammalian intestine are harmonized by a local mechanism of that


PIGMENTARY SYSTEM OF THE FROG.
