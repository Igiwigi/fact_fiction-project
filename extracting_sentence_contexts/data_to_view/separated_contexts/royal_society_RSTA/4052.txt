INTRODUCTION. THE existence of a relation between the depression of the freezing point, produced
by dissolving an acid or a salt in water, and the electrolytic conductivity of the
solution thus obtained was pointed out by ARRHENIUS in 1887, and has been the
subject of much experiment and discussion since that date. As is well known, the facts of electrolysis indicate that an electric current, when
passing through a solution, is associated with a passage in opposite directions of the
constituents of the salt, Farapay called these mobile parts ions. The number of
the ions depends on the chemical nature of the salt, and is usually indicated by its
formula, Thus for one molecule of potassium chloride we have two ions, the
potassium travelling in one direction and the chlorine in the other, For barium
chloride or sulphuric acid we have three ions, and, since the electric charge of an ion
is proportional to its valency, the electrically equivalent weights of these substances
are represented by $BaCl, and }H.So,, respectively,

The freezing point of water is depressed by equal amounts when molecularly
equivalent weights of various non-electrolytes, such as cane-sugar or alcohol, are
dissolved in it, Equivalent quantities of electrolytes, however, produce greater
effects. Thus a gramme-molecule of potassium chloride causes nearly twice as much
depression as a gramme-molecule of sugar, while the effect of barium chloride or
sulphuric acid is almost three times as great as that of a non-electrolyte.
