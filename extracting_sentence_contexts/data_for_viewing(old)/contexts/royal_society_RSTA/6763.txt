equilibrium either by remaining straight or by deflecting by a definite amount which is
determined by the magnitude of the load increment. However, large deflexions can only
develop at the conventional critical load. In terms of the particular problem discussed in
this paper, Shanley’s concept is that secondary flexure occurs while the primary loading
moment is increasing, so that the lateral deflexion and twist take place under increasing load.

If the primary bending moment is permitted to increase while secondary flexure is taking
place, the unloading zones of figure 6 tend to disappear. This implies a reduction in
the value of the secondary flexural rigidity, for in the previous case part of this rigidity was
derived from the unloading zones. If the increment in the primary bending moment is
sufficiently high, the unloading zones will disappear entirely, and the secondary flexural
rigidity will then be as low as possible for the particular value of the primary bending moment
under consideration. In fact this lowest value B’ of the secondary flexural rigidity B will be
the value for a beam of rectangular cross-section of depth 2hd which behaves elastically, so

that B’ = 4 Epdb = pB,,. Thus in the case of pure bending, the lowest value M’ of the
applied bending moment at which lateral deflexion could occur with increasing load is given
by finding the value of / which satisfies the equations

While Shanley’s concept of the bifurcation of equilibrium which arises in plastic buckling
is of considerable theoretical interest, it is felt that in practice the conventional critical load
should be considered as of greater importance, for it is this load at which actual collapse
occurs. In practical testing, the possible growth of deflexion under increasing load in the
manner described by Shanley would be masked by the inevitable deflexions arising owing
