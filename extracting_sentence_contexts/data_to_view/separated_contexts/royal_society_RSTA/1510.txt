We were also able to perform STED and LFSM on the same biological sample with comparable
resolution, confirming the high-resolution setting of the setup. The prolongated blinking
with deep blue illumination (350-380nm) was the key to achieve a high signal density and
subsequently the high resolution. This comes from the fact that the final resolution of an image
depends not only on the precision of localization but also on the total number of independently
localized signals [29,35]. At this point, we wish to re-emphasize that the blinking phenomenon can be observed in
ProLong Diamond as the imaging medium. This simplifies the need to prepare special buffers
consisting of the classical redox cocktail required for dSTORM [14] and other related super-
resolution techniques [16].
