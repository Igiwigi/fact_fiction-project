(Model 2, 9.81/14.63) less time interacting F2F. Instead, they
emailed each other between 22% (Model 3, 1.24/5.75) and
50% (Model 4, 1.54/3.07) more.

As one might suspect, dyads on the same team or with the
same role communicated more, both F2F and by email, relative
to dyads on different teams or in different roles. Gender, in con-
trast, had no significant effect on the volume of either form of
interaction. Physical distance did show a small inverse effect
on F2F interaction (Model 2): the nearer the two workstations,
the more F2F interaction. This effect was notable both for its
small size relative to the size of the effect of the open office
and for the fact that it was limited to F2F interaction (not
email). We investigate this in further detail next.

(ii) The effect of physical distance on F2F versus email findings from electronic interaction data. Our finding that
Model 2 of table 2 shows that the effect of physical distance on changes in workplace design affect electronic and F2F
F2F interaction is small—and the effect on email insignificant— interaction networks differently (and, on some measures, in
relative to that of openness. The relatively small effect of opposite directions) should make future researchers wary of
distance on F2F interaction was surprising given that repeated using one network as a proxy for the other.

studies have shown that people talk more to those who are
physically closer to them [62,63]. When others are physically
proximate, it is easier to be aware of them [64], start conversa- ° :
tions with them [64,65], unexpectedly encounter or overhear 4. Discussion
