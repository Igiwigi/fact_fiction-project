On the one hand the roller must slide sideways, that is, in a perpendicvlar direction
to its plane of rotation, or the relative velocity cannot be changed. On the other
hand no sliding or slipping must take place in the direction of its rotation, which must

Abe only a motion of pure rolling contact. "The roller has to work upon continuously-
Schanging circles, and nothing in the nature of a toothed or serrated edge is admissible.
2Such a serrated edge has, indeed, been introduced by some inventors, and the sur-
Sface of the cone or disk on which it works made, as of course it must be, of softer
metal. This was 80 in the instrument of MoseLey for integrating the work of a
Steam engine ; but it is a significant fact that the committee speak of the *slight
Zfurrows” caused in consequence upon the driving cone.* Now it is easy to see that
Sthese slight furrows must introduce an error, as the position of the roller continually
Zehanges, and quite vitiate the differential principle of action. The force of friction
2which must therefore be employed to ensure rolling contact leads to the three
