Que quoniam citra communem nature
ordinem quasi monstrosa extitit, parem cum ceteris perseverantiam obtinere nequibat ;
yeluti neque nove ex elementis constantes generationes et monstra diu durant. “Et quamvis in tota czelestis mundi vastitate materia pro conformatione alicuius
stelle ascititize, meo judicio abundé suppetat ; tamen nusquam copiosius et pleniits,
quam juxta Viam Lucteam, quam substantiam quandam celestem 4 materia reliquarum
stellarum non discrepantem, sed diffusam certisque locis expansam, non in unum
corpus discretim, prout in stellis fit, conglobatam esse statuo: hincque factum judico
quod nova hee in ipso Galaxiz margine constiterit.” It will be seen from the above extract from TycHo Braur’s work that the fact that
the Nova appeared on the edge of the galaxy was used to give weight to the hypo-
thesis of stellar formation advanced by him. Indeed, some observers imagined they
could see the hiatus or opening out of which the Nova came. The disappearance of
the star was supposed to be due either to some action in itself or to its dissipation by
the light of the Sun and stars.
