relatively large value, in our case 10 by the third cycle, small variations between profiles could
make it more difficult for the inversion algorithm to reproduce the synthetic spectra accurately.
Likewise, this is further complicated by asymmetries and zero point shifts in the profiles over
time [49]. A combination of these factors will mean that the Stokes-V is probably less accurately
reproduced than Stokes-I across all inverted profiles in the data, thus, resulting in a smaller
R? value.

It should be noted, that it is not advisable to make direct comparisons here between the R?
values between the 1000G and 1600G simulations, to determine which case is more accurately
reproduced by the inversion algorithm. The reason why this is not possible, is due to the fact
that the two have different numbers of frames and, therefore, a different total number of spectra
from which these parameters are obtained. Therefore, the 1600G R? value may be artificially
higher in comparison to the 1000 G value purely for the fact that there are less measurements and
potentially fewer outliers than the 1000G data. This would imply that the algorithm performs
better in returning the synthetic spectra for the 1600G simulations, but that is not necessarily

R=1 (3.1)


the case. A meaningful comparison cannot be made in this case. We can only specify that in
both cases, the Stokes-I appears to be more accurately reproduced by the inversion algorithm;
however, we cannot say that the inversion algorithm reproduces the Stokes-I more accurately for
the 1600G simulations in comparison to the 1000G simulations. With the same number of data
points in the Stokes-I and -V spectra for a given simulation, we can make meaningful comparisons
in comparing the outputs of the inversion algorithm in this scenario.
