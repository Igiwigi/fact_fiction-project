combined movement the pedicellarizz are the most active, the spines 8omewhat slower,
and the pedicels very much slower. If the shape of the stimulating body admits of it,
the forceps of the pedicellarize seize the body and hold ib till the spines and pedicels
come up to assist,

And here we have proof of the function of the pedicellariz. In climbing perpen-
dicular or inclined surfaces of rock covered with waving sea-weeds, it must be no 8mall
advantage to an PFchinus to be provided on all sides with a multitude of forceps
adapted, as described, to the instantaneous grasping and arresting of a passing frond.
For in this way not only is an immediate hold obtained, but a moving piece of 8eaweed
is held steady, till the pedicels have time to establish a further and more permanent
hold upon 3t with their sucking dises. That this is the chief function of the pedi-
cellariz is indicated by the facts that, 1st, if a piece of sea-weed is drawn over the
surface of an Fchinus, this function may clearly be seen to be performed; 2nd, that
the wonderfully tenacious grasp of the forceps is timed as to its duration with an
apparent reference to the requirements of the pedicels, for after lasting about two
minutes (which is about the time required for the suckers to bend over and fix
themselves to the object held by the pedicellariz if sach should be a snitable one)
this wonderfully tenacious grasp is spontaneously released ; and 3rd, that the most
excitable part of the trident pedicellarie is the inner surface of the mandibles, about
a third of the way down their serrated edgesâ€”1.e., the part which a moving body
cannot touch without being well within the grasp of the forceps. When the forceps
are closed, they may generally be made immediately to expand by gently stroking the
external surface of their bases.
