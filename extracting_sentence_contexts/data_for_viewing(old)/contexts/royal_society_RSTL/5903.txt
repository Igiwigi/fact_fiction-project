that there were large amorphous rocks at the foot of the Serra Giannicola in which no
stratification is discernible, and which consist in great part of innumerable dikes, some
of very large dimensions, penetrating tuffs and agglomerates, the latter so altered by the
intrusive matter, that the only divisional planes to be seen are such as are parallel to
the walls of the dikes. But on this occasion (October 1857), I found masses of con-
siderable thickness, not far above the base of the Serra Giannicola, distinctly stratified.
The rocks alluded to consist of alternations of trachyte and trachytic agglomerate in beds
of variable thickness, dipping at angles of from 20? to 28® to the north-west, or towards
the central axis of Etna, that axis being about three miles distant in a horizontal
direction.

My companion, Signor G. G. GEMMELLARO, had become well acquainted during pre-
vious visits with this fact of a northerly dip in the Giannicola beds, which was, I believe,
first, discovered by Baron S. vox WALTERSHAUSEN ; for I learnt on my return to England
that it had long been known to him, although not as yet published in his *Atlas,” the
fifth and sixth Numbers of which had not appeared in 1857. I was the more struck with
the discovery, from having on the same day observed that the beds in the lower half of
Zoccolaro (sce Map, fig. 14), which are directly opposite, or about two miles to the S.E.,
and very similar in colour and mineral compoxsition, dip in a contrary direction, or to
the S.E., while those at the foot of the Montagnuola, as well as those between it and the
Giannicola, are inclined to the S.W.

I knew, from what I had seen of Etna in 1828, that in the outlying and isolated rocks
