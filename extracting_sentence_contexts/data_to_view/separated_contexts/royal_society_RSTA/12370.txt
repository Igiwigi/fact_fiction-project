One of the attracted spheres, B, was for this
purpose placed between two vertical levers, in a tank through which could be run a
continuous stream of cold or warm water. These levers depended from horizontal
rods which could rock or slightly rotate on fine point suspensions. This was, in fact,
akind of double Lavoisier and Laplace apparatus. The motion of each lever was
shown by another lever of about the same length, rising vertically up from each
horizontal axis, and serving as the moving support for a double suspension mirror
in which was viewed the reflection of a millimetre scale. Two telescopes and one scale
were used for the two mirrors, though it would not have been difficult to arrange
one telescope and two scales.
