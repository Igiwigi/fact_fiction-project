The experiments were now repeated, making intentional eye movements with the
object of testing whether it was possible to detect momentarily indications that colour
vision was normal, where it would have been better for it to have been reduced, and vice
versa. But no such instances could be detected; the changes from normal to reduced, and
back again, appear to take place as quickly as the movements of the eyes themselves. This
matter of the rapidity of the change from one type of vision to the other will be referred
to again in the next Part.

(66) The phenomenon of irradiation

The fact has long been known that, as a rule, white objects on black backgrounds look
larger to an observer than do black objects of the same size on white backgrounds. This
increase in the apparent size of a white object is called ‘irradiation’. Several explanations
of it have been advanced: (a) that it is due to diffraction and aberration, which cause white

to encroach on black; (4) that it is due to light from directly illuminated retinal receptors
spreading sideways on to those in the neighbourhood, which are not directly illuminated ;
(c) that it is due to the effects of nerve conduction which, either during chemical trans-
mission, or during the performance of some physical process, spreads to other nerve fibres
which are close to or are touching nerve fibres, or synapses, which are directly connected
to stimulated photoreceptors; (d) that it takes place, because of similar processes, in the
brain.
