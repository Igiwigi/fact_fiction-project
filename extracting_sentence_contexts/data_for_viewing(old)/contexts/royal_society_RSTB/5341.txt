It seems probable that the formation described by Frorimp as the unpaired rudiment
of the vertebral body represents the ventral portion of the opisthospondylous zone fused
with the anterior portion of the interventrals.

The cartilaginous ring developed, according to Frorrep, from the unpaired rudiment
of the vertebral centrum probably represents the whole opisthospondylous zone fused
with the vertebral ring disposed in front of it. This portion of the vertebral body arises
in Larus and Struthio as a differentiation of that region of the perichordal tube which
comes to lie between the incipient vertebral ring and the primary intervertebral body.
It is composed of voluminous cells arranged tangentially with regard to the notochord
and forms the hinder end of the primary vertebral body, as the prospondylous ring
furnishes the cranial end. The fact that Froriep insists on the development of the
vertebral body from an unpaired ventral cluster of cells may be explained by the observa-
tion made by the present writer in Larus and Struthio, that the ventral wall of the opis-
thospondylous zone at its first origin is somewhat thicker than the corresponding wall
of the prospondylous zone.

The pro- and opistho-spondylous zones have no phylogenetic significance. They
represent adaptive structures formed in order to meet the mechanical requirements
existing between successive vertebrae. This explains the weaker development of the
ventral portion of the prospondylous zone in comparison with the much-better-expressed
ventral portion of the opisthospondylous zone. The function of the ventral portion of
the prospondylous zone is performed by the basiventrals. With the gradual reduction
of the basiventrals, the ventral and ventro-lateral portions of the prospondylous zone
