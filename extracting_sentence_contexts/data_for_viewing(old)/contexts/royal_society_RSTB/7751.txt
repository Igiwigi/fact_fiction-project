Second Welsh Glacier jostled with it for position and left equally extensive evidence of its
existence in the West Midlands and Severn Valley. There is, however, an earlier Berrocian
(Be) glaciation, represented by the lower boulder clay of Northants, the Bubbenhall clay,
Wills’s First Welsh deposits, and the ‘Northern Drift’ of the south Midlands, which was
just as extensive as its successor, but relics of it are fragmentary compared with those of Ca,
partly because of the immensity of the interglacial period which separated the two glacial
periods and partly for the very reason that the second glaciation was in a position to
obliterate the effects of the first. The products of the Ca glaciation are so extensively pre-
served because no subsequent ice maximum reached nearly so far south—the Irish Sea
(Co) and Welsh Re-advance (Cy) fell short by a hundred miles or so.

These facts are entitled to more than a local significance, for immediately they suggest
that the Ca glaciation was the same as the Drenthian of Holland (the only one which
leaves in that country major evidence of land ice), the Saale of Germany, and the second
of the two larger Alpine glaciations, the Riss. All subsequent cold phases in the Midlands,
represented south of Wolverhampton only by periglacial solifluxions and terrace gravels
with cold fauna, then become stadia of the Weichsel or Wiirm. The first Midland glaciation
(Be) becomes equivalent to the Elster and Mindel, and up to the present we can find no
clear evidence that the less important Gunz cold period left any mark on central England.

This broad correlation would probably now find widespread acceptance—certainly it
agrees with views expressed by Zeuner (1945), Wolstedt (1950) and Arkell (1951). Any
attempt to place the Ca glaciation one stage further back and to equate it with the
Elster poses the problem that nothing of importance remains in the Midlands to represent
