The tuning-fork oscillator and amplifiers providing the supply current are housed
in a metal cabinet some 50 ft. from the bridge, and are connected to it by twinned
cable enclosed in an earth-connected sheath of copper braid. The amplifier is
actually housed in an outbuilding of the Laboratory some 150 metres from the room
in which the bridge stands, and is connected to the bridge through a toroidal
transformer, the windings of which are electrostatically screened from one another,
The purpose of this transformer is to avoid imposing on the detector points of the
bridge the very large earth-capacitances of the long leads to the amplifier, for,
although the use of the Wagner earthing-arm renders the effect of these capacitances
nugatory, the ease with which the necessary conditions of balance, both on the main
bridge and on the Wagner arm, can be approached is largely influenced by the
magnitude of the earth-capacitances of the detector arm. In fact, if these
capacitances are so large that their impedances become comparable with those in
the bridge network, the adjustments on the bridge and on the Wagner arm cease
to be independent and the approach to the final balances can be made only by a
great number of very small adjustments. By having an isolating transformer near
the bridge, all this trouble is avoided, as the earth capacitances which are effective
are only those associated with the leads between bridge and transformer, which can
be kept very short. The return leads from the amplifier to the galvanometer are
in any case isolated from the bridge and their length and associated capacitances
are of no very great significance.
