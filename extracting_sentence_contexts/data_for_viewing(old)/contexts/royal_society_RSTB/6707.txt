the inferior) seems to exist. On the La Quina left hemisphere it connects in Kerrn’s
Gibraltar cast and in recent men.”

In his interpretation of Dusseldorf Neanderthal man and La Chapelle R. (see
his fig. 1), the connexion of the sulcus frontalis medius with the sulcus praecentralis
inferior is clearly portrayed, as is also the fact that the sulcus frontalis inferior is
rudimentary. Whether this interpretation of the sulci in ‘Neanderthal man is
correct or not, it is very impressive that it so closely accords with the conditions
seen in Q.1905.R., S.6.L., $.4.L., S.5.R., Q.2788.R., and other hemispheres.

Kappers goes on to say :—‘‘ Concerning anthropoids I must confess that this
fissure is very often described (recently again by Mrncazzint (1928)) as S. frontalis
inferior. This is caused by the fact that the frontalis inferior in anthropoids may fail,
or—on account of its steep course in those animals—is not recognized as such, and
the sulc. medius, often connected with the precentral reminds one of the frontalis
inferior of men.”

My agreement with Kappers on this point is best emphasized by referring to figs. 68,
82, and 90 of Mincazzint. In his fig. 68 the sulcus rectus, lying axially in the frontal
keel, is labelled as the sulcus frontalis inferior.

The whole question of the homology of the frontal sulci will be continued at the
end of this section on the frontal lobe.
