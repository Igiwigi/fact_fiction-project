The coefficients with true minima are Cp1,
the downscale spectral transfer coefficient of b, C,; and C,z, both of which govern upscale
and downscale spectral redistribution of turbulence kinetic energy, and Cip2, which provides a
mechanism for the break-up of fluid parcels in scale due to turbulence. Using the coefficients
obtained by optimization at At = 0.05, we proceeded to compute the case of Af = 0.75 and found
that the quantitative agreement with DNS is fairly good, similar to the low Af case. Thus the
optimization at low At also holds at high At, which is consistent with the fact that density contract
(Atwood number) dependence is not explicit in the LWN model.
