Lo
Traces of it are contained in meteoritic material, specifically in the measured overabundance : <
of !°Be when compared to that of the Galaxy (at the time of the Solar System formation) [1,2]. a
Indeed, !°Be is a short-lived radionuclide whose half-life is only 1.5 Myr so that the measured : S|
overabundance implies that it was incorporated in the meteoritic rocks exactly when they formed, i
namely at the very beginning of the Solar System formation process, 4.5 billion years ago. In other :Z
words, !Be provides us with a snapshot of the very early Solar System. That in itself might not :8

be such important information if it were not for the fact that !Be is only formed by spallation
reactions, namely the breaking of O and Si atoms when they are hit by protons and nuclei with
more than 10 MeV of energy [3-5]. Therefore, the overabundance of 10Be in meteoritic material
tells us that at the very beginning of the Solar System there were energetic (with greater than or
equal to 10 MeV) particles and that their overall dose was about 1019-1070 particles cm~? [6]. However, meteorites cannot tell us why and where the energetic particles were present.
