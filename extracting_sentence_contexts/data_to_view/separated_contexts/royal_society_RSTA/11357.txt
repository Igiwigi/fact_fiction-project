It has been found
advantageous to have a feeble light which can be flashed momentarily on the aperture
to guide the eye just previous to the disappearance of the light. This is more
particularly the case when it is desired to extinguish with the centre of the retina,
as is the case in these observations. The intrinsic light in the eye is also sometimes
difficult to deal with, but by judiciously recognizing the fact that it exists, and by
giving proper intervals between each observation, one is enabled to surmount this
difficulty. Again, a healthy state of mind and body is most essential when making
observations, as the sensitiveness of the eye largely depends on it.
