thus far, solely accounts for the centreline of the thread. Reverting this dimensional reduction, so
as to restore a finite thickness in the thread, requires an additional step. This step may be achieved
by direct measurement of the thread radius at impact, ac, or else using mass conservation, yielding
Ac = /Q/m Uc, where Q is the flow rate of the system.

Our geometrical model, coupled to the aforementioned method, may therefore be used to tune
the parameters of the experiment, Vy or H, in order to ‘program’ the thread and drive its buckling
instability in a controlled and constructive way. We note the contrast between the simplicity of
the nozzle’s motion, simply translated at constant speed in the x-direction, and the complexity of
the print, which presents features in both the x- and y-directions. This richness is the sole result
of the fluidic instability that, in fact, shapes matter through geometrical nonlinearities, thereby
offering an avenue for patterning complex media, such as glass, in a controlled and tunable way. Here, the
coiling instability is used as an instability-assisted design tool, which can be taken advantage of
towards the assembly of larger structures.

4. Patterns as building blocks

In this section, we show how coils and other related patterns may be used as building blocks
towards the fabrication of larger structures.

Using the settings provided in §3b, we print a piece by moving the nozzle along a circular
trajectory with a relatively large radius R = 50 mm > R¢. Upon completion of a circle, the printing
plate is lowered to account for the filament thickness, and another circle is made. In figure 5a,
