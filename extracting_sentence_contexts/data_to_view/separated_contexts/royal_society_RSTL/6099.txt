Buy, in showing that
dibromide of ethylene can be conyerted into a corresponding sulphocyanate, and in the
conclusions which he drew from this observation, until, in the brilliant experimental
researches of WURTz on the diatomic alcohols, the doctrine of polyatomic compounds
has received its clearest and most elegant expression. Considering the untiring activity with which chemists have devoted themselves to the
Study of the polybasic acids and, within the last few years, of the polyatomic alcohols,
it cannot but appear remarkable that so little attention should hitherto have been
bestowed on the polyacid bases. It is true that we are already in possession of many
valuable observations relating to these bodies ; but they are isolated, and the facts which
they have established can scarcely be looked upon as more than accidental acquisitions. Regarded in the scientific sense as a class, and in their relations to other groups of
bodies, the polyatomic bases have hitherto been left without examination. Respecting the constitution of these compounds, and the conditions under which they
would be produced, no doubt could be entertained.
