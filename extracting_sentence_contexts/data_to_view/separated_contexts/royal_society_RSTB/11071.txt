However, when we measured the apparent
numerosities of higher densities, the effect was reduced,
being only 15% with of 100 dots (3.3 dots degâ€™). We also asked subjects to judge the density of the patterns. At low densities, the connected patterns seemed about 25%

less dense, despite the fact that they were in fact more dense,
as they have more patterning within the same area. However,
at higher densities, the results inverted, with the connected
patterns appearing to be denser, corresponding to the physical
reality. Thus, at modest densities, it would seem that perceived
density was driven by perceived numerosity, rather than the
other way round, in agreement with other work [37].
