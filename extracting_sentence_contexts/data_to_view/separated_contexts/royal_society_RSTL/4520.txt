If we consider the resistance
in the circuit, which includes the experimental helix and the galvanometer coil, as
nothing, then a magnetic pole of constant strength passed a certain distance into
the helix, would produce the same amount of current electricity in it, whether the
pole were moved into its place by a quick or a slow motion. Or if the iron core be
used (2668.) the same result is produced, provided, in any alternating action, the
core is left long enough at the extremities of its journey to acquire, either in its
quick or slow alternation, the same state. This I found to be the fact when no com-
mutator nor dominant magnet was used; a single insertion of a weak magnetic pole
gave the same deflection, whether introduced quickly or slowly ; and when the resi-
dual dominant magnet, an iron wire core, and the commutator in its position «, b
(2677.) were used, four journeys to and from produced the same effect at the galva-
nometer when the velocities were as 1:5 or even as 1:10.

2682. When a copper, silver, or gold core is employed in place of the iron, the effect
is very different.
