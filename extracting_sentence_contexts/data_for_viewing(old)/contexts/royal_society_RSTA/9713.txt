Total Solar and Sky Radiation Calculated at me Tid from Mean Attenuation Coeficents at rasliaiia:


416 _ MR. LOUIS VESSOT KING ON THE SCATTERING AND

TABLE X.—Quality of Sky Radiation at Mount Wilson, October 17, 1906.

Observations on the quality of sky-radiation have been made at Mount Wilson.* The values given in
the present table are calculated in terms of the mean coefficients of attenuation at that station, ‘The units
of intensity in the calculated and observed values are both arbitrary. The calculated intensities are
reduced to the same units as the observed intensities by multiplying the former by the mean value of the
ratios of the intensities corresponding to the different wave-lengths. The results are compared graphically
in Diagram XIII. The agreement is seen to be fairly satisfactory, in spite of the fact that the mean values
of the coeflicients of attenuation are used in calculating intensities on a particular day.
