obtained by its exposure to detonation. A considerable compactness or density, and a
consequently great resistance to motion of the particles, is essential for the detonation
of gun-cotton, as pointed out at page 497.

There are, however, several well-known facts, and some results of experiments insti-
tuted with special reference to this s8ubject, which do not appear to be in harmony with
the asxumption that the detonation of nitroglycerine and gun-cotton in the manner

described is simply due to the suddenness of the development and application of physical
force. The following are some of the more important facts of this kind ;â€”

1. The circumstance that the explosion of mercuric fulminate accomplished the deto-
nation of gun-cotton, whereas explosive agents less sudden in their action failed to
furnish this result, appeared to render it probable that silver-fulminate, which explodes
more suddenly and with much more powerful local force when applied under the ame
conditions, would accomplish the detonation of gun-cotton more readily than the mer-
cury-compound, 7. 6. it was anticipated that a larger amount of the latter would be
needed, than of silver-fulminate, to produce the desired effect. This proved, however,
not to be the case; though apparently not inferior, the slver compound is in no way
superior to that of the mercuric fulminate. The minimum quantity of the latter which
can be relied upon to detonate compressed gun-cotton is 0324 grm. (5 grains), and it is
necessary to enclose that quantity in a case of stout, sheet metal, and to place it in close
