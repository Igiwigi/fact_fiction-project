when the insect can no longer make headway against the wind, that is, when it is in a situa-
tion where ordinary compensatory responses cannot be ‘successful’, this causes a switch-over
from the first, compensatory type of optomotor reaction to the second, opposite type of
optomotor reaction.

For higher fliers, the stability of down-wind courses was expected from the hypothetical
analysis, because a locust can achieve its preferred retinal velocity and air speed while
oriented down-wind in a strong wind while it be fairly high, but not ifit be low. But to some
extent the greater duration of down-wind courses among high-fliers could be attributed to
the mere fact that they took longer to complete the other type of response to strong wind,
descent (p. 192). The tendency to turn down-wind in excessive wind has less chance to
show itself among low-fliers, for among them it is cut short by settling or by entry into
a slower-moving air layer near the ground.

The optomotor theory in the literature. ‘The optomotor theory of wind orientation has been
discussed by Fraenkel (1932), de Lépiney (1928, 1933), Williams (1930, 1942, 1949), Gunn et al.
(1948) and Waloff & Rainey (1951). None of these authors has, however, quoted observations
with theaccompanying information on both wind speed and height of flight which would help to
decide for or against the optomotor theory. Fraenkel recognized that the necessary evidence was
not yet available. He called, in particular, for information on wind orientation over a uniform
substrate such as the sea (Fraenkel 1932, p. 205). Just this kind of evidence in favour of the
optomotor theory of wind orientation is now available for locusts (pp. 192-193), but at that
