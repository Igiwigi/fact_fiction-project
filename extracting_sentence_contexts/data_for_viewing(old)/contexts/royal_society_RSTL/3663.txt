contents of © cells” in general, an attentive examination of these pale cells of the
erystalline has also strengthened a view mentioned in my last memoir-,—that,
however minute the © cell,” and wherever it exists, it is by the coalescence of discs
that its membrane is formed. Thus in fig. 156. «, 3, the outer discs are scen entering
into the formation of the membrane of the cell; the remainder being now the nucleus
of the cell. At 3B, fig. 154, the cell-membrane is formed. We thus seem to have
even here a mode of origin of the membrane of the cell, essentially the same as that
which, in a former paper, I showed to form the chorion{,—as will be hereafter
pointed out in the membrane of the ovisac,—and as seems to be the mode of produc-
tion of other, and perhaps all, membranes, as well as fibrous tissues.

174. Other facts observable in an examination of the pale cells of the lens, are
equally confirmatory of my views regarding © cells” in general. The nucleus is very
distinctly seen to be composed of discs (figs. 154, 155, 156.), into which it divides ;
and at a certain part, there is s0metimes seen a highly refracting object, correspond-
ing apparently to the nucleolus of authors, but, as I believe, being really an orifice
communicating with the exterior of the cell.

175. I have already mentioned my inability to confirm the idea of Professor
Scnawann, who supposed it to be by elongation, that these pale cells form the fibres
of the lens. It is true he makes the addition, © I have several times observed the
arrangement, one upon another, of the nuclei of cells; hut do not know what it
indicates. It is also very possible that the coalescence of cells may take place to form
a fibre ; but hitherto I have no decisive observationsh.” It affords me satisfaction to
