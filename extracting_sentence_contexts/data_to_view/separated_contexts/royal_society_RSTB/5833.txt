Other larvee from the same culture would metamor-
phose on a sandy bottom. Contact of the Polygordius larvee with the sides and bottom of the containing vessel
might very well bring about metamorphosis, for we have seen that in Mitraria contact
with solid matter—in its case grit—is necessary. The fact that so many metamorphosed
in the tow-net, as recorded by WoLrEREcK, is strong evidence that contact stimulus
is a natural condition for the metamorphosis to take place. Possibly in the sea Poly-
gordius larvee do not change into worms until they touch the bottom. Therefore the
fact that S6pERsTR6w’s larve in his stirring jar did not metamorphose is not surprising
and is no argument against the naturalness of cataclysmic metamorphosis.
