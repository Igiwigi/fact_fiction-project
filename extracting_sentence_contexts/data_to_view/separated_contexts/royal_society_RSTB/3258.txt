The most posterior of these veins opens close to the junction of the olfactory
vein with the longitudinal sinus, perhaps directly into the latter.

2. Vene choroidee anteriores (fig. 1, v.ch.a.).—A pair of veins arise from the
system of choroid plexuses of the third and lateral ventricles, and leave the brain
immediately in front of the commissura aberrans, side by side with the anterior
choroidal arteries. They run vertically upwards, close alongside the wall of the
paraphysis, right and left, and open into the sinus longitudinalis at their dorsal
extremities, They are in contact with the wall of the paraphysis for some distance, and
probably receive blood from it, The left anterior choroidal vein, in its upper portion, is
much larger than the right one, owing to the fact that it receives the vena terminalis.

2a. Vena terminalis (fig. 1, v.t.).—I propose this name for a large unpaired vessel
which comes up from between the cerebral hemispheres immediately in front
of the lamina terminalis, receiving a conspicuous branch* from the anterior
commissure and several from a plexus of veins which lies between the two
hemispheres in this region. It opens into the left anterior choroidal vein.
