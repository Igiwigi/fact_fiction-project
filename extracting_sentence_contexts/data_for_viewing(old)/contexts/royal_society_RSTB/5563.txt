type of spore that can be related with certainty to the sporangia originally described by
Dawson. It has been found within practically all the sporangia studied, both from the
Manchester University Museum and from the British Museum specimen. In some
sporangia these spores were present in such large numbers as to suggest that few or
none had escaped. The spores have mostly been met with in a flattened condition,
though occasional examples were rounded or oval. In size they ranged from 100 p
to 60 » ; the wall was smooth and there was a relatively small pyramidal apical region.

Concluding Remarks.

The main purpose of this paper is to make some additions to our knowledge of the
remains from Gaspé which Dawson included under the name Psilophyton princeps.
The facts ascertained from the specimens available for study suggest the need of more
detailed examination of other small-leaved Early Devonian plants. Any full discussion
of the questions on which the new data bear would be premature until the corresponding
features of these other remains have been ascertained. All that can be done at present
is to comment briefly on the directions in which some of the observations recorded here
seem to point.

The details as to the appendages borne on the markedly spiny stems from Gaspé
are of interest for themselves and also provide characters that may be of use in com-
parative morphology. The observations made on the well-preserved spines have not
only confirmed previous statements as to their being flattened in the vertical plane, but
have added some structural details. No evidence is forthcoming that the appendages
had a vascular supply, though the nature of the preservation does not justify a definite
