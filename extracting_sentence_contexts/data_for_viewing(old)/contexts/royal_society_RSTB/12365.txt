these aspects of terrestrial life. These changes include respiration (i.e. gaseous
exchange, but also mode of ventilation), support (and locomotion), nitrogenous
excretion and reproduction.

Popular accounts of this transition often consider it from the perspective of our
own experience of going from land into the water. Our mode of nitrogenous
excretion works as well underwater as it does on land, and we are not immersed
for long enough to be concerned about reproduction. Support is also of little con-
cern, as we find ourselves buoyant in the water, although swimming is
energetically expensive compared to walking or running on land. Rather, our
main concern is respiration, which we perceive as getting enough oxygen.
Note, however, that our modes of obtaining oxygen underwater, whether via a
snorkel (of limited length) or an oxygen tank, also reflect the fact that our mode
of lung ventilation by expanding our rib cage also does not work well under
the pressure of a column of water.
