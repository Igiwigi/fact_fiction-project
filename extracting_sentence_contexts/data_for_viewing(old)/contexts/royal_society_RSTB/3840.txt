non-existing tissue; but, taking the observations at their full value, they imply
a production of two transverse prophyll members, which might be normally expected
to continue the phyllotaxis system. The progressive loss of such members and their
vestigial retention in the lowermost flowers of an inflorescence system is a familiar
feature of floral organisation in higher plants. The mere occurrence of such
rudiments does not, however, in the least postulate that any further members of
a decussate system are to be hypothecated, unless they can be actually proved to be
present (Lianrer and Tyson, 1912, Whorl II). f

The rest of the flower consists of a terminal ovule. There can be no doubt about
the fact-that it is an ovule, being composed of a massive nucellus, with central
megaspore and endosperm, and this is invested by two envelopes.

The outer envelope springs from the extreme base of the ovule, and is enormously
extended tangentially to give rise to a wing-expansion, ultimately utilised in seed-
dispersal. To all intents it is a simple outer integument (Sykes, 1910); but,
following the use since the time of Hooxerr (1864), it may be convenient to still
designate it “perianth.” In the functional flower it is a delicate wing, about
10 mm by 12 mm,., following the general contour of the subtending bract, to which
it is closely adpressed (fig. 3). It completely encloses the nucellus and base of the
stylar tube as an efficient investment, only a small aperture as a slit between
tooth-like edges at the apex allowing the stylar tube to passthrough. Histologically
it is remarkable for differentiation into—(1) an inner region of thin-walled aqueous
