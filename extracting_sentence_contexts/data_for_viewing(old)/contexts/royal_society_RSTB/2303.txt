from Nissl and Weigert-Pal preparations of serial sections. It shows both the
nerve cells and the nerve fibres, and clearly demonstrates the position of the line
of GeNnNARI between the two granule layers, and also its abrupt termination at the
change in lamination. Only layers 1, 2, and 3 a, b, ¢ are illustrated in this prepara-
tion. By the microphotograph in fig. 7, Plate 10, is illustrated the general appearance
of a section of visuo-sensory cortex. This illustration is purposely chosen to represent
the intermediate appearances which exist between the apical or flat and the side
sections of the cortex. It is prepared from the lower or right-hand half of section 17

in figs. 15, 17, and 19. By comparing this microphotograph with the previous ones
it will be at once seen how much less clearly defined are the various layers, and how
difficult and unsatisfactory micrometer measurement would be in this case. This
fact would be much more obvious were a wider strip of cortex depicted in the
illustration.

186 DR. J. S. BOLTON ON THE EXACT HISTOLOGICAL LOCALISATION

Exactly the same layers can be described and measured in sections of the cortex of
infants, where the line of GENNARI exists as in adults, although, owing to non-
development of the neurones concerned in its structure, it is difficult or impossible
to prepare even moderately satisfactory Weigert-Pal preparations. The line of
GENNARI also exists in anophthalmos, as may be seen by examination of the micro-
photographs in Plate 11, figs. 9, 8, and 10, which are respectively taken from the apex
