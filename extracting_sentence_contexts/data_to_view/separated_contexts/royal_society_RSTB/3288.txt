In such cases we know that
the water in which the mineral was deposited could not have been free from plant
débris, none the less the mineral appears now to be free from it. We need not
follow the argument further: enough has been said to show that there is strong *
evidence on the side of the view that the Wirral dolomite was deposited amidst
plant débris at the same time that the coal was being formed. When compared
with the “coal ball” formation in the lower seams, it becomes clear that the case is
not unique as Mr, SrraAHAN supposed, and that in fact it is quite a parallel develop-
ment to that which formed the coal balls. This case is a useful example to illustrate
the great size which may be reached by mineral masses in coal, and affords a further
illustration of what we saw in the lower beds, viz., that they may be very much too
large to have been transported after their formation, No one could suggest that



ORIGIN OF THE CALCAREOUS CONCRETIONS KNOWN AS “COAL BALLS.”
