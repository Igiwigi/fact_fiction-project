A JueRING (Lit., No. 20, p. 229), bent upon the search for proofs of inter- and

Excalation of vertebrae, came (p. 221) to the conclusion that “in the primary condition

&vo segments fall to one segment of the body ; in all higher Vertebrata the complete

Bay segment is composed of one skleromere, one myomere, and one neuromere. Sich segments, which contain only one vertebra, I call monospondylous segments, and

Loppose to them as dispondylous segments, those which contain two vertebra, 7.e.,

rose in which two vertebre fall to each myomere or neuromere.”

£ On p. 235 he gives some examples :—

'8 Acipenser : all the segments are monospondylous.

3 Amia: exquisitely dispondylous in the tail.

& Elasmobranchs : mostly dispondylous in the tail.

% (Scymnus is monospondylous.)

4 Higher vertebrates.—Monospondylous [because they are arco-centrous].

§ While Kérzicer, in speaking of Heptanchus, obviously meant by “ Wirbel” only
eir centra or bodies (because he said, “die Zahl der Wirbel ist um das doppelte

Brisser als in der Mitte”) Juertne meant by Wirbel the centra + arches, Not

‘ouch fault can be found with such a conception of a “ vertebra.”

& However, the very notion of a vertebra, Wirbel, or spondylus, has been founded
pon the higher Vertebrata, not upon Fishes, many of which have no vertebral

centra; the term vertebra should therefore be restricted to a complete skleromere,

ten skleromeres or vertebra belonging to as many myomeres or neuromeres. In fact

« vertebra is a skleral segment. Hasse (“ Monograph,” p. 21) applied Juerina’s terms only to the centra,
supplanting a somewhat different meaning for these well-meant terms, and thus

causing confusion, especially since he introduced the unfortunate notion of “ Poly-
spondylie,” He mixed up two totally different processes, namely, the increased
number of arcualia in a given segment with the increased number of chorda centra,
