412 DR. G. J. HINDE ON BEDS OF SPONGE-REMAINS IN THE

principally to the tetractinellide and lithistides. I did not find in any of the beds a
8ingle example or even the casb of an entire sponge.

The sponge-beds appear not to continue with any regularity in a horizontal diree-
tion, and they vary also in their characters in short distances. Thus the beds in the
cliff section to the west of the harbour, though only imperfectly shown, are thicker, |
and decidedly contain more chert than those of the section deseribed. This fact has.
already been noticed by Dr. Frerox* in the detailed sections which he has given of
the various exposures round Folkestone, The same author describes very faithfully
the peculiar characters of the sponge-beds, but, strange to 8ay, he does not seem to
have noticed the sponge-spicules in them. Mention is indeed made of siliceous
spongy or spongiform concretions, bub it is clear from the context that reference is
only made to the peculiar porous nature of the deposits. They are also compared to
the concretionary whetstones in the upper greensand of the Blackdown Hills in
Devonshire, which latter, as will be shown in the sequel, are likewise s8ponge-beds.

the Isle of Wight, sponge-remains do not appear to be present in them.
