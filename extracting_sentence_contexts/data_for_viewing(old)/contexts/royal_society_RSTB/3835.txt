The free injection of the enamel tubes with alcoholic fuchsin from the pulp cavity,
the stain passing not only into the tubes, but also into portions of the matrix substance
which have escaped calcification.

The great variations in size of the tubes in the enamel.

The evidence given by ground transverse sections of enamel stained by the fuchsin
method, where cross sections of the tubes are seen within the stained interprismatic
substance,

The demonstration in developing teeth of spiral tubes stained more deeply than the
surrounding enamel, winding round the prisms, the turns of the spirals being much
too wide to enable them to be interpreted as running within the prisms ; and the fact
that the spiral character of the tubes completely distinguishes them from the columns
of prisms, which in their alterations of course are not so abrupt and do not follow the
same directions,

308 MR. J. H. MUMMERY ON THE NATURE OF THE TUBES IN MARSUPIAL

The appearance of the Tomesâ€™ processes at the margin of the forming enamel in
calcified sections, where they are seen to interlace with one another and to be stiffened
in many places with calcific deposit which appears to take place regularly along their
