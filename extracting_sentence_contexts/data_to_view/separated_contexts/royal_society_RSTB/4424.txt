HOBSON ON THE

though this change is most marked when the subject had had food shortly before
the commencement of the experiment, it also occurs to a less degree when he
was in the post-absorptive state. The diminution of respiratory quotient during
long periods of exercise is also shown in these experiments. Apparently, therefore,
our experiments are not vitiated by the fact that the subjects had had breakfast
about two hours before the commencement, though no doubt the degree of alteration
that we observed was exaggerated by the fact that the subjects were not in the post-
absorptive state. If the view is right that carbohydrate may be used in greater proportion during
work than during rest, a diminution of respiratory quotient during the work would
seem by no means improbable, since the degree of rise will no doubt be to some extent
dependent on the availability of carbohydrate, and this will quite likely be lessened
as the stores of carbohydrate in the muscles or in the body at large are depleted in
consequence of the heightened metabolism. It is clear from all these experiments
that there is a good deal of difference between different individuals, and between the
same individual at different times, as regards the character of their metabolism.
