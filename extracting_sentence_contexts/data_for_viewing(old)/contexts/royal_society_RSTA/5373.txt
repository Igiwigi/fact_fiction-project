For ease of analysis in practical implementation of e
expansion is frequently used:

, the following well-known power series

ok
x
= » ar (3.28)
=0

The power series is fast converging, thus the number of terms does not have to be too big.
In fact, it can be reduced to just a few first terms. This reduction affects the accuracy of the
implementation but makes the implementation and analysis easier and faster. We consider two
examples of the approximation of the exponential transfer function. First, taking into account only
three terms of the power series expansion, we achieved

21 1
Ts!

~ , 3.29
° eB ~~ (T2/2)s2% + Ts’ +1 (3.29)

and, second, taking into consideration four terms we achieved
