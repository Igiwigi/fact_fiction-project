I., I., II., the maximum action, which,
we shall hereafter show, is proportional to the time of exposure. -2 We have explained the fact, that the mixture of chlorine and hydrogen does not
Smbine in the dark to form hydrochloric acid, by the supposition of the existence
E5 a certain resistance to combination which is overcome when the gaseous mixture is
Sposed to light. This resistance to combination can be considerably increased by a
Sriety of circumstances. The presence of a very small quantity of foreign gas in the
rmal mixture of chlorine and hydrogen is sufficient to cause this resistance to be
Mcreased to a very great extent.
