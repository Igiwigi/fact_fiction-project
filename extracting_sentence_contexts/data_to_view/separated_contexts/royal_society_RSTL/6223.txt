The vertical partitions are much thicker, and are not thus minutely and regularly per-
forated ; but they exhibit a small and variable number of large
apertures (fig. 4, «, a), that lead into the adjacent cells which lie
in or near the same horizontal plane. TI say # or near, because it
is seldom if ever the case that the horizontal partitions or floors
of two adjacent vertical piles of cells are on the same level ; and,
in fact, the typical arrangement (though frequently departed from)
seems to be, that there is an alternation in the levels of the floors
of adjacent piles (as shown in the accompanying diagram, based on some parts of fig. 3),
and that every chamber in any pile B normally communicates with two chambers in each
of its adjacent piles A and ©, by one passage aboye and the other below the floor that
divides them. 217.
