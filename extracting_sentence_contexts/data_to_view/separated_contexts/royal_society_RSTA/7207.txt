It is, however, desirable to check that,
in the general case, the solution is continuous across @-+ 0) = 17, particularly in view of the
fact that the subsequent analysis centres on an examination of the field at points on this line. The discontinuity in the geometrical optics term (99), found by subtracting its value at

It is not difficult to show that (137) is balanced by the discontinuity in the diffraction term. This latter arises solely from the first expression on the right-hand side of (133) ; in fact, using
(118) and noting that B = 0 on 0+0, = 17,

We remark that the necessity here for replacing (139) by (140) only arises because, owing
to the greater complexity of the analysis, our method of approximation in the mixed-path
problem has been slightly less refined than that adopted in the case of a homogeneous earth.
