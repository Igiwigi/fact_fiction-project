legitimate and illegitimate births—in other words, these figures confirm the view
arrived at above, that the white women who submit to illegitimate union are more
apt to produce F. ova than.the married women; and this occurs in spite of the fact
that a larger proportion of the former are probably primipare. For coloured people the same general statements are applicable, but there is an
obvious difference in degree, the excess of M. is nothing like so high as in whites. The total average for stillborn children is 121°6 M. per 100 F., that is 21°53
higher than for births.
