Instead, it can be shown that du/ox
and ov/dy attain large values at points immediately adjacent to the stagnation
points. 58 R. V. SOUTHWELL AND H. B. SQUIRE ON A MODIFICATION Again, in the (approximate) solution obtained by Berry and Swary* for the case of
slow viscous flow past an elliptic cylinder lying with its major axis along the stream,

examination shows that the integral | pdy does in fact tend to a finite limit as the

length of the minor axis tends to zero. Here we are concerned to test the accuracy of our methods of approximate calculation,
and accordingly we shall adopt the formula (76), in order that our results may be com-
parable with those of Bairstow, Cave and Lane. They obtained the resultf
