A detailed analysis of the PES at B3LYP/cc-pWCVTZ level of theory allowed one to establish
the mechanisms behind the aforementioned fragmentation process [15,16]. [Ca(formamide)]?+
complexes undergo a charge separation reaction yielding [Ca(NH2)]* + HCO*. However, the
formation of [Ca(OH)]* + [HCNH]*, which are the most stable products, originates in the
complexes involving formimidic acid (its structure can be seen in the int2 of figure 5), produced
by a previous isomerization of formamide. These [Ca(formimidic acid)?+ complexes are also
the origin of a multistep mechanism which leads to a very stable local minimum, in which the
metal dication is simultaneously bound to HCN and to H2O. The dissociation of this complex
finally leads to the loss of HyO or HCN, both experimentally observed, although the former is
slightly more stable. Finally, it is important to emphasize that the CID spectrum obtained at 11 eV
(laboratory frame) shows that the dominant process corresponds to the appearance of Ca**, that
is, to the loss of the intact formamide molecule, which is apparently in clear contrast, as mentioned
in the Introduction, with the fact that the whole PES of [Ca(formamide)]**+ system is lower in
energy than the formamide + Ca?* reaction channel. The knowledge of the critical point of the
PES was, then, the first point to investigate whether unimolecular dissociation kinetics can give
some explanation on the reactivity more than the mere analysis of energetics, in particular, related
to the observation that the Ca?+ product shows a high intensity. In the next subsection, we then
report the kinetic results.

(b) Statistical unimolecular dissociation

A simplified picture of the re-computed PES at the G96LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory (used in the
dynamics simulations) is shown in figure 5.

Then, we can obtain, per each elementary event, the RRKM rate constants (see ยง2a). For this,
