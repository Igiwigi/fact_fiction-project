Robinson & Sadowksi showed in [35] that it is an easy corollary of the results in [17] that the
box-counting dimension of the singular set is no larger than! 5/3, and as a consequence were
able to prove that for any particular suitable weak solution there is a unique particle trajectory for
almost every initial condition: even when the solution is only ‘weak’, the Lagrangian formulation
of the dynamics still makes sense. (The proof combines an argument due to Foias et al. [37] that
produces a volume-preserving particle flow for any weak solution, with a dynamical result that
for almost any initial condition such a flow must avoid the singular set. The almost-everywhere
uniqueness follows relatively easily.)

8. Conclusion

We end with a quick summary of the above discussion. The key fact to take away is that
proving the uniqueness of solutions depends upon being able to show that they are sufficiently
smooth. There is, therefore, a natural hierarchy of solutions, whose properties improve with their
regularity.

— Very weak solutions are not unique.

— Weak (finite-energy) solutions may not be unique, but exist for all time. They enjoy various
‘partial regularity’ properties, which are, for example, sufficient to show that ‘particle
paths’ exist for almost all initial conditions, so that a Lagrangian approach is valid even
for weak solutions. This is an avenue that deserves to be explored further.

— Strong (finite-enstrophy) solutions are unique but can be guaranteed to exist for only a
