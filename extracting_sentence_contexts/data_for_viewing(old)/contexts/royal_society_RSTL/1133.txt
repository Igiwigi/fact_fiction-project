(See 6th fact.)

We are now unavoidably led into a discussion of a question
which has at all times occupied the attention of naturalists.


v8 Dr. Ridfikiips08”s Letter on the basatti: Surface
Whence\arise «the Tnequatlilies with which the Surface of the
Earthis' $0:exceedingly diversified?. «;

I shall not attempt to encounter this question""generally,
nor to extend my enquiries' beyond the limits I have pre-
scribed to myself; but I shall try whether' the curious facts
so profusely exhibited over our basaltic area, throw any light
upon the formation of our own inequalities, or lead us a step
towards the discovery of the operations by which such stu-
pendous effects have been produced.

Some to escape the difficulties in which this question is
involved, ascribe our inequalities to original formation ; as if
the world had come from the hand of the Creator withithe
variegated surface which now contributes 0 much” to its
beauty ; but the frequent interruptions; and resumptions of the
Strata in our area, with the perfect resemblance of the corres-
ponding parts, however great the mterval by which they are
