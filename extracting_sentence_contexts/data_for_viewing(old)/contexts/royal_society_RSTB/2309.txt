In Tables I. and IL, figs. 49 and 50, are given, in millims., the measurements of the
visuo-sensory and visuo-psychie regions respectively in the six brains which have
been examined, and in Tables III. and IV.,, figs. 51 and 52, these measurements have
been reduced to percentages of Case 1.

In addition to the chief conclusions to which attention has been drawn many
points of interest may be seen on careful examination of these tables. In Table IIT.,
fig. 51, the almost exact correspondence, allowing for the necessary errors of measure-
ment, of the depth of the conjoined 4th and 5th layers is well shown, as is also the
extreme atrophy of the line of GeNNaRi in the blind cases, and the considerable
decrease of thickness of layer 3a. In Case 6, owing to the almost complete
invisibility of the latter layer, layers 3a and 3b were measured together. On
examination of layers 1 and 2 another important fact appears, viz, that there
is an almost exact correspondence between the thickness of the conjoined Ist and
2nd layers of the cortex, and the degree of amentia or dementia existing in the
patient. Case 1 is normal, Case 4 which showed a relatively slight degree of
dementia approaches most nearly to the normal. Cases 5 and 6 of infants aged
respectively three months and one month come next in order, and Cases 3 and 4
of pronounced chronic insanity with dementia, occupy the last place on the list.
This is a point of considerable importance in view of the facts that the 4th and 5th
layers show no constant variation, and that layer 3 as a whole is of the same thick-
ness respectively in the three patients with normal vision, and in the three cases of
blindness. In Table IV. (fig. 52), a similar relation is seen in the respective depth of
the conjoined 1st and 2nd layers of the cortex in the different cases. Here, however,
in the infants, and especially in the younger of the two, this layer is much thinner
