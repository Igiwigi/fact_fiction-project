ment*, and added a snggestion that such of the readers of * Nature” as should have the
opportunity of repeating this experiment on the other species of Medusz during the
summer and autumn months of 1875, should do 80 on as many species as possible. I
have to regret that no one appears to have acted on this suggestion ; but at the same
time, I have to express my best thanks to Dr. Lirzxex for the yery valuable reference
which he has snpplied. Dr. F1xer's paper clearly shows that he made the fundamental
observation in the case of Aurelia aurita and Cyanea capillata quite independently of
my suggestion in © Nature;* and Dr. Lifzxex's reference to this paper has been of special
value to me from the fact that up to the time when T received it (viz. February 1876)
no one in England appears to have been aware that Dr. Enter had done any work in
connexion with the neryous system of Meduse. This ignorance is to be accounted
for by the fact that the journal in which Dr. Encer published his paper has but a very
limited circulation in this country, while of the paper itself no abstract appears in the
© Centralblatt.”

The following is a full abstract of the results and opinions set forth by the paper in
question.

In Aurelia aurita the author observed that excision of the lithocysts was usually
followed by complete and permanent paralysis of the swimming-organ, while any tissue
left adhering to a lithocyst continued rhythmically to contract © like the excised heart
of a frog.” He appears, however, to be decidedly of the opinion that the seats of
spontaneity are not the lithocysts alone, but the entire crescent-shaped interruptions of
the margin in which the lithocysts are lodged (see Plate 32). He arrives at this conclusion
