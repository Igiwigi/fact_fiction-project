Figure 4. Shear-induced unfolding of the domain A2 of the VWF protein. In (a), the progress of the unfolding is represented. The 3
peripheral regions of the proteins that first disassemble under the action of the longitudinal flow are indicated by the black and :B
red circles. The central hydrophobic core that breaks after a few nanoseconds is indicated by the green circle. Arrows represent (2
pictorially the tumbling of the protein under the rotational component of the flow. In (b), the distances between representative DA
HB donor and acceptor linking the B-strands of the hydrophobic 828;B, core are plotted as a function of time along with the Dw
end-to-end distance of the protein. :

precise sequence of the unfolding events. In fact, at lower shear rate, the tumbling of the protein [8
owing to the rotational component of the flow, could expose to deformation different fragments .

of the protein matrix and induce a different downhill cracking of the fold. As a next step, the

LBMD technology based on the quasi-atomistic force field for proteins OPEP will be deployed to

study the shear rate dependence of the A2 unfolding rate, and, following the pioneering work of

Katz and co-workers [54], of domains separation.
