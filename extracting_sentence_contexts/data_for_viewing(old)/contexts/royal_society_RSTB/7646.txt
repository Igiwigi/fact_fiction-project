between Ammonites normanianus d’Orb. of the Middle Lias and ‘ Leioceras’ of the Upper Lias,
and since he placed Harpoceras serpentinum (Reinecke) in Leioceras, his statement would now
read ‘intermediate between Protogrammoceras of the Domerian and Harpoceras sensu stricto
of the Toarcian’; which is an assessment that can still hardly be improved upon.

The closest match in the literature is still Ammonites crassifalcatus Dumortier (1874, p. 257,
pl. lii, figs. 1, 2) from the Upper Toarcian of Verpilliére in the Rhone basin. Thevenin
identified his largest Madagascar fragment with Dumortier’s species, but intermediate
material from Arabia shows that the Madagascar fragment is merely the outer half-whorl
of a full-grown madagascariense. Specific identity with the European form cannot be
claimed in ignorance of the inner whorls of crassifalcatus (Dumortier says nothing of
a bisulcate tricarinate venter) and in view of the considerably less simplified septal suture
shown on Dumortier’s figure. Thevenin himself, in fact, rightly pointed out that his
specimen is more evolute than Dumortier’s and might prove to be only a variety of
P. madagascariense. It also reaches the unicarinate stage earlier than A. crassifalcatus.

The only other possible close comparisons for Harpoceras madagascariense are with the
genus Protogrammoceras Spath (1913, p. 547). Even a similarly simple suture-line with
rounded lobes is illustrated for P. pantanellii Fucini (1900, p. 27, fig. 27) and P. semilaevis
Fucini (1900, p. 31, fig. 31). From this one might be inclined to infer a Domerian age for
madagascariense, especially if like Thevenin one assumes the simplicity of the sutures to
be primitive.

On the other hand, all the characters are just as closely matched among later
Toarcian forms. The curve and general style of the ribbing are identical with those of the
