stresses, by showing that the limiting range of stress coincided with the difference of
the two elastic limits.

Objects of the Research.

The present research, which was carried out in the Whitworth Engineering
Laboratory of the Owens College, was undertaken at the suggestion of Professor
2 OSBORNE REYNOLDS, who proposed an investigation of “ repeated stress” on the
following lines:—(1) The stress should be direct tension and compression; and
(2) of approximately equal amounts, such tension and compression being obtained by
means of the inertia force of an oscillatory weight ; (3) the rapidity of repetitions
should be much higher than in the experiments of W6HLER, SPANGENBERG,
Bauscuincer, and Baker, in fact, ranging as high as 2000 reversals per minute.
The importance of these points will be seen from the following considerations :—

(1) By far the greater number of experiments on “ repeated stress” have been
carried out on bars subjected to bending, the ordinary formula for stress in a bent
bar being used to calculate the stress at breaking, that is, in such experiments it has
been assumed that the distribution of stress at the breaking-down point is the same
as for an elastic bar. Calculations on this assumption are not expected to give the
tensile strength of a material for an ordinary cross-breaking experiment. This difficulty
is completely overcome, and no such assumptions are necessary, when the stresses are
direct as in the present work. The (direct) stress in a bar of metal could easily be
obtained by having one extremity rigidly connected to a part of a machine having a
known periodic motion, the other extremity being attached to a known weight.
