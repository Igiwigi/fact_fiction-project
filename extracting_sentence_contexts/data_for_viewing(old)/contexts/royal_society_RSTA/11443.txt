* Tt has been used by Orvis, Sir Grorae Humpnry, and others, and, as we have seen, gives quite
incorrect results for races from 155 to 175 centims. in stature.

the same time it must be remembered that the stature falls within the range within
which our chart shows that a very slight change in the long bones makes a great
difference in stature. In case the reader should be inclined to put too great faith in FI, I
would draw attention to the fact that it underestimates by slightly over 5 centims. the

and M fairly closely.

The only other Bushmen I have been able to find are a male and two females in
the Royal College of Surgeon’s Catalogue. Selecting the right members as those for
which our formule and curves are deduced, we have :

Male, F=35'6 centims., H = 25°5 centims., T= 29°9 centims., R= 20°8 centims.
Female 1, F=388:0 ,, B= 270) T= 3825 4; 1 iL)
