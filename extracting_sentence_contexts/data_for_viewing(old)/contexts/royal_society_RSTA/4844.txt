5. Invertibility of the spectral operator and an asymmetric reformulation
of the Riemann hypothesis

We have discussed in §3b (based on [3,4]) and in §4d (based on [8-10]) two different, but related
(at least in spirit) symmetric reformulations of the RH; see theorem 3.4 (from §3b) and theorem 4.8
(from §4d), respectively. Our goal in this section is to provide a new asymmetric reformulation of
the RH (due to the author), as well as to explain why it cannot be modified so as to become
symmetric (with respect to the midfractal dimension c= 4) without drastically changing the
nature of the problem. As we shall see, this new reformulation is directly expressed in terms
of the invertibility of a.

In §4d, we have studied the quasi-invertibility of the spectral operator a=a¢ (that is,
the invertibility of each of its truncations al) = a), where T > 0 is arbitrary). In fact, both
theorems 4.7 and 4.8 (from §4d) are stated in terms of the quasi-invertibility of a, either for a fixed
cé (0,1), withe¢ ; (in theorem 4.7), or (in theorem 4.8) for all c € (0,1), with c# 3 (equivalently,
for all ce (0, 3) or, else, for all ce G, 1)). (Recall from the discussion following theorem 4.7 that
1/2 is not quasi-invertible and, hence, not invertible.) However, although very convenient in
the context of §4d, the new notion of ‘quasi-invertibility’, because it involves a truncation of the
infinitesimal shift 0 (and, hence, also of a as well as of its spectrum o(a); see the beginning of §4d),
is perhaps not so easy to grasp or to verify explicitly. Indeed, we lack concrete formulae for a‘),
whereas we have several explicit expressions for a at our disposal, even when c € (0, 1).

It is therefore natural to wonder whether the (usual) notion of invertibility of the spectral
operator a = a, cannot be used to reformulate the RH in this context. (See the discussion following
theorem 4.1 for the usual notion of invertibility of a possibly unbounded operator.) The answer
