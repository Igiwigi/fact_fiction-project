OF THE BARK OF ERYTHROPHLEUM GUINENSE. 649

From this experiment it is scen that after the primary slowing due to stimulation of
the vagus-roots and the quickening due to paralysis of the yagus ends in the heart, a
8econd slowing occurs.

'This second slowing might be due either to stimulation of the inhibitory apparatus
in the heart or to weakening of the cardiac motor ganglia.

The latter seems improbable, from the fact that each systole during this slow period
instead of being weak is exceedingly strong, the pulsation in an artery being felt very
powerfully when the finger is laid upon it, and the rise of pressure during it being very
great, as shown by the oscillation of the mercurial column of the manometer.

A In order to ascertain more exactly whether the inhibitory cardiac ganglia were

FN stimulated or not the following experiment was tried.

Z Experiment XXXIX.
