is found to be 0.88 s (figure 5). However, for the free-floating problem in waves there is no sign [sz
of a resonant piston-mode motion around 0.88 s. This is consistent with theoretical considerations [Ss
by Mclver [20], who found that within linear potential flow theory the main contributions from .
the diffraction and the radiation potentials are 180° out of phase around the piston-mode natural

period for a freely floating body. The latter fact was numerically confirmed for this case as well

as for a case with twice the moonpool width. Figures 4 and 5 show for the freely floating body

in incident waves that there is a pronounced large-amplitude moonpool behaviour only at the

natural heave period of T=0.75s.

Many authors have shown before that the potential-flow added mass and damping coefficients
in heave for the moonpool problem are highly frequency dependent in the vicinity of the piston-
mode resonance frequency. For instance, negative added mass values occur. Furthermore, a clear
minimum in the heave damping occurs. The latter implies a clear minimum in the frequency-
domain linear vertical wave excitation amplitude according to potential flow [21]. (See [22] for
