To return now to the polypnoea obtained by exciting these fibres in
the internal capsule, Orr describes how by using needle electrodes he was enabled in
the Rabbit and in the Cat to evoke exactly the same polypnoeic condition that we
produced in the above-mentioned circumstances. He was exciting the fibres,
according to our view, of the capsule leading from the cortex. The very important
results which he obtained, and the bearing which these facts have upon heat
regulation and the pathology of fever wil! be found in his communicatien. The next point is of course the relation which the laryngeal movements thus
described bear to the other respiratory movements.
