required to know the value of A, ..., ete. in the expansion (6),—that is, actually to
perform the expansion. Tt is a great advantage of the method that this procedure is
not necessary ; but on the assumption that the expansion exists, the conjugate relation
does in fact provide us with a method for determining the coefficients. Initially (when ¢ = 0), we have from (6) and (7)

b= b =A +... PAW, +o. 2.5.54... (16)
Multiplying both sides of this equation by V2,, and making use of the conjugate
relations (13), we obtain on integration
