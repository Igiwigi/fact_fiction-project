At p. 600 of the same memoir he again speaks of © medullary
rays or bundles of barred vessels,” from which IT infer that bundles of vessels are als
referred to in the previous sentence. So far as I can ascertaim, none of those observers
who preceded me have distinctly recognized the true secondary medullary rays described
both in this memoir and in the preceding one,

BRoOXGNIART, CorDa, and KiNnG agree in considering the Diploxylons to be Gymno-
spermous Exogens, associating them in that great group with the true Sigillarie. I think the facts now published finally settle this primary question. It being admitted
by all authors that the Lepidodendra are Oryptogams, the Diploxylons can no longer
be regarded by any one as Gymnospermons Exogens; and as the close identity of BRONG-
NIART'S Sigillaria elegans with Diplozylon is equally obvious, we must accept the entire
group as Lycopodiaceous. Dr. DawsoN, in his recent memoir on SigillariatF, arrives at
a different conclusion ; but whatever may be the case with Transatlantic specimens, there
is not the slightest room for doubt about our European ones: they are all modifications
of the Lepidodendroid type.
