In the second place it has been shown that increase of venous p
not accompanied by a corresponding increase in the rapidity of the lymph-flo
propositions, therefore, have been answered in the negative. It was next shown that section of a nerve has no influence upon the speeifie g
of muscles supplied by it: this is contrary to what should occur upon Rany
of the exudation as being the result of increased tension. The explanation of passive cedema as a purely mechanical phenomenon, dut
increased rapidity of filtration through the walls of the blood-vessels, is theref
borne out by experiment. }

Reference has already shortly been made to the fact that a ligature pla
dog’s limb often causes oedema to appear not only on the distal but al
proximal side of the ligature. In itself, this is a powerful argument ag
influence of venous congestion as a direct cause, since the parts on the twos
the ligature are obviously in very different conditions, so far as concerns ye!
congestion. Secrion VIIJ.—Tue Errect or Hamosrasis my A Lime.
