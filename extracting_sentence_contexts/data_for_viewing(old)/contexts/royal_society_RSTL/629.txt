I cannot refrain from just observing, that it appears to me to
be extremely difficult to reconcile the results of any of the fore-
going experiments, with the hypothesis of modern chemists re-
specting the matertality of beat.

and invisible operations; and being moreover fully aware of the
danger of forming an attachment to a false theory, and of the
folly of wasting time in idle speculations; I have ever, in my phi-
losophical researches, been much more anxious to discover new
facts, and to show how the discoveries of others may be made
useful to mankind, than to invent plausible theories; which much

and science.

There are however situations, in which an experimental en-

him to abstain from forming, or adopting, some general theory,
for the purpose of explaining the phenomena which fall under
his observation, and directing him in his future researches.

Finding myself in that situation at this time, I beg the atten-
