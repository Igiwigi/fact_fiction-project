no right to. say that chlorine is capable of being
acidified by oxygene, and that an acid compound exists in the
hyper-oxymuriates. We: know that chlorine is capable of
being converted into an acid by hydrogene, and, as I men-

ought not to be overlooked; and all the new facts confirm an
opinion which I have more than once before submitted to the
consideration of the Society, namely, that acidity does not
depend upon any pecutiar elementary substance, but upon

peculiar combinations of various substances. Rome, Feb, 15, 1815. Nors.
