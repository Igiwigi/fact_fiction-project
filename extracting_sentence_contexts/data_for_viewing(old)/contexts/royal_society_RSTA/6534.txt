Not unreasonably, politicians and policy-makers want to be sure that the
‘science is right’, before confronting these and increasingly difficult decisions,
oth now and in the future. It puts us (that is, the scientific community
represented in this important volume) bang in political spotlight. And as the
yapers assembled here show, there are still many issues about which individual
scientists do not yet agree, ranging from exactly how to measure sea-level
accurately, to the drivers and causes of the current rates of increase. But we need

o ensure that these inevitable scientific challenges are not misinterpreted by the

nay-sayers of this world. Nobody who took part in the meeting is saying that sea-
evels are not rising, driven in significant part by human action (just as virtually
no serious scientist disagrees with the fact that smoking is a significant cause of
ung cancer). The disagreements are about more subtle problems. In our search
or scientific excellence, we must not lose sight of this simple and important
message.

I was fortunate to be able to take part in the first day of this conference,
1ugely impressed by the range and depth of the scientific presentations, and cross
hat I could not stay for the whole meeting. I am therefore delighted to see the

completed volume, and congratulate the editor and authors on bringing this
important enterprise to a satisfactory conclusion.
