£ Considering the weakness of the solution, the loss of irritability brought about by

Stronger solutions are used, and their action compared with that of similar solutions
Be the lower fatty aldoximes, cenanthaldoxime is seen to destroy muscle irritability
sgnuch more quickly than these lower homologues. Its power to provoke contracture
also greater as witnessed by the same tracing. Equally weak solutions of the
ower aldoximes show no signs of contracture.
© Muscle Curve.—The curves are simply affected in the descent by contracture,
a phenomenon exactly similar to that observed in the action of ethylaldoxime. In
fact, whatever difference there is to be seen in the curves of muscles poisoned with
any of these aldoximes simply depends again upon the amount of contracture, and the
rapidity with which irritability is lost. One tracing will suffice for all.

Fig. 33 represents the curves described by a muscle in a 1 per cent. solution of
propylaldoxime. An interval of three minutes was allowed to elapse between the
registrations. No. 1 is the normal curve, immediately after which the propyl-
aldoxime solution was applied.

The muscle was the gastrocnemius of a Frog. Temperature, 16°1.C. Load,
12 grms. Coil at 10 centims.
