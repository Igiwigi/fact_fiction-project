basin, while in the second one (figure 9c,d) the parameters correspond to the yellow basin. It can
be seen that in figure 9b the oscillation frequency matches the forcing frequency, while in figure 9d,
when the delay-induced resonance is triggered, the oscillations frequency is different. Actually,
the frequency of the sustained interwell oscillations is w = 1.35, which is in agreement with the
frequency of the delay-induced oscillations of Region IV (F = 4 = 0), as we can check in figure 2h
and its legend.

We depict, in figure 10, Region IV oscillation frequencies, @max calculated with the FFT, for
different orbits changing the values of the parameters yw and F. In particular, in figure 10a we
show the frequencies of the delay-induced oscillations setting F = 1 = 0. Then, in figure 10b-d, we
show the oscillation frequencies for yp = 0.04 and F = 0.01, F=0.1 and F =0.14, respectively. We
can appreciate that as the forcing amplitude grows, the oscillation frequencies are restored to the
no-damping case. In fact, in figure 10b, the frequencies are nothing similar to the non-damping
case. On the other hand, in figure 10c, the frequencies curve is almost restored, except for some
boundary t values that are related to the zones of the region on the parameter space in which
there still remains some fractalization. Finally, figure 10d shows that the oscillation frequencies
return close to the values of no-damping case. To corroborate it, we have plotted the curve fits in
