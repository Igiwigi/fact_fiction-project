to the simplest motion (B) there appears to be general agreement with the conclusion
of Ketvin,{ that the laminar flow is in all cases stable for infinitely small disturbances,

* It will be appreciated that approximate solutions, or solutions limited to very slow motions, are usel
for an examination of stability.

Osnorne Reynotps (‘ Phil. Trans.,’ vol. 174 (1883), pp. 955-6).

“ The fact that the steady motion breaks down suddenly shows that the fluid is in a state of instability
ior disturbances of the magnitude which cause it to break down. But the fact that in some conditions

but that for disturbances exceeding a certain limit of size the motion becomes unstable:
these limits of stability being narrower the smaller the viscosity. On the other hand,
this conclusion has not been held to be satisfactorily established, even in regard to two-
dimensional disturbances ; RAyLEIcH has described the problem as * of no ordinary
difficulty,”* and Lamp remarks (1924) that “ Most writers who have attacked the
