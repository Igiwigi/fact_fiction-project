7. Partial regularity

Finally, we discuss ‘partial regularity results’, which limit the size of the set of possible
singularities of weak solutions (or a subclass of weak solutions).

(a) The set of singular times

Scheffer [15] showed, using a result of Leray (!), that the set T of singular times has Hausdorff 78
dimension no larger than 1/2, dimj;(T) < 1/2. We give the proof from [32] of a similar result for :3
the box-counting dimension here, since it is very simple but nevertheless provides a model of :&
the proof of a much more powerful result about space-time singularities that we discuss shortly.
It combines the fact that near any ‘singular time’ T the solution must blow up at the particular
rate in (5.4) with the bound So |Vu(s)||? < 00, valid for any weak solution. The finiteness of the
integral means that there cannot be too many times T near which the lower bound holds.

There are number of equivalent definitions of the (upper) box-counting dimension (see [33]),
but the most convenient to use here is

dim (A) = lim sup log N(A,#)

where N(A, ) denotes the maximal number of ¢-separated points in A [so N(A,£) ~ ¢~ dimp(A)],
