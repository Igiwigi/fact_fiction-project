Moreover, the
lowering progressively increases while the more acute symptoms of oxygen-want are
passing off. It also takes many days for this lowering to pass off on a return to
higher atmospheric pressure, whereas a rapidly produced lowering, as by going for two
or three hours to greatly diminished atmospheric pressure, passes off within an hour
or two. In view of these facts it does not seem probable that the diminished alkalinity of
the blood at high altitudes is due merely to an excessive production of lactic acid. * Lonastarr, ‘ Mountain Sickness,’ London, 1906. +
