can be paired ‘on paper’, but not uniquely, with no particular way being privileged.

I will use the example of system (2.4) in the remainder, sometimes mentioning and sometimes
only implying a generalization to any system of random variables. However, the generalization
is trivial only if we confine our discussion to systems of random variables with finite numbers
of contents and contexts, and to random variables that are categorical, i.e. have finite numbers of
values. The latter is not a restriction for the CbD approach, in which all random variables should
be replaced with sets of jointly distributed dichotomous random variables before contextuality
analysis can be applied [1] (we need not, however, discuss this construction in this paper).

3. Joint-distributional understanding: identically connected couplings

The first meaning of contextuality is based on the obvious fact that one can consider a multitude of
ways the six random variables in (2.4) could be jointly distributed ‘on paper’ (knowing that they
are not jointly distributed de facto). This formulation (with the words ‘could be’) is hinting at
counterfactuality, but we need not go that way: mathematically, we simply consider all sextuples
of jointly distributed random variables
