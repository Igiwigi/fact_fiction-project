Along the dorsal and lateral regions, but espe-
cially the dorsal, in the neck, trunk, and tail, the outer surface of certain of 8nch
scutes is produced into a ridge. In the Alligators ventral as well as dorsal scutes
have an osseous 8upport. This character is 80 remarkable in the extinct Crocodilia of
the Oolitic period that the Teleosaur of the Caen deposits was characterised by CUVIER
as *Vespdce la mieux cuirass6e de tout le genre.”*

552 PROFESSOR OWEN ON SOME REMAINS OF THE

In the Wealden Goniopholis the quadrangular dorsal seutes are united, tile-wise,
by peg-and-sockeb joints ; the equally thick ventral scutes join each other by thick
i sntural borders, and an annular arrangement of the armour needs but little to be

complete, *

; This, in fact, is effected in a more closely mailed Saurian described under the name
j of AMtosaurus ferratus.t Nearly a score of these extinct Reptiles, in all their panoply,
were discovered and exposed on one slab of * Middle Keuper sandstone,” at Haslach,
in Wirtemberg. The arrangement of the scutes is annular. The long axis of the
dorsal ones is transverse and a single pair spans the back and corresponding surface
of the tail : the ventral scutes are quadrangular, in four transverse pairs : there is

Q a single large lateral seute on each side.
