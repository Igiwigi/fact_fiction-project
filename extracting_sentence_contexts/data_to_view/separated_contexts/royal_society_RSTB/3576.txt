of fatty nature (see, for instance, Rostn, 1896, and
RoBertson, 1899, pp. 232, 233). The evidence afforded by [Halla, while not conclusive, because the nature of the
substance of which the yellow granules are composed remains undetermined, is, at
any rate, suggestive. The substance and pigment of the yellow granules in the
nerve cells of Halla have been shown to be closely similar to, if not identical with,
those of the chlorogogen granules, which are admittedly excretory products, a fact
which indicates that the granules in the nerve cells are probably insoluble products
of metabolism. It may be here remarked that, judged by their staining reactions, the granules in
the chlorogogen cells of Halla do not appear to have a uniform composition,
and there is also some variation in regard to the reactions of the yellow granules
in the giant cells of various specimens. The association of fat with the yellow
granules in the nerve cells of Halla appears to be usual, but the amount of fat so
present is very variable in different specimens.
