The deficiency of hydrogen

Q in the products of explosion, although absolutely small, is relatively very large. The
ON question then arises as to whether the missing hydrogen may not be present in the
E form of aqueous vapour. None was detected in the analysis of the gases; but it is not

= difficult to explain this fact, as the extremely hygroscopic property of the residue would
= most effectually dry the gasesâ€”the absorption of the yapour by the residue being
SZ actually demonstrated by the greasiness obseryed on the surface of the deposit and on
S the sides of cylinder immediately on its being opened after explosion. The entire
= proportion of water formed or preexisting must therefore have existed in the solid
Tz residues, but its determination therein was obviously impracticable.

2 The amount of water present can, however, be calculated from the deficiency of
= hydrogen shown in our Tables. F I, CONDITION OF PRODUCTS AT THE INSTANT OF OR SHORTLY AFTER EXPLOSION.

=E A careful examination of the contents of the cylinders after they were opened showed
0 that, at all events shortly after explosion, the solid products were in a fluid state.
