Special attention must be drawn to the fact that higher numbers than those given
were sometimes obtained; however, these large deflections accompanied general
movements of the animal, due, in part, to the fact that it is extremely difficult to
maintain a proper degree of anzsthesia. If this is too slight, the stimulus causes a
general awakening of the whole cerebral system. :

The question of bilaterality will be referred to in the next chapter. It remains to
institute a general comparison between the galvanometric effects observed in both
cord and nerve when the cortex and corona radiata are respectively excited. Such a
comparison will lead to a better understanding of the part played by the bulbo-spinal
centres, though any complete inquiry into this difficult question must be postponed to
Chapter XI., which treats directly of the matter. ,
