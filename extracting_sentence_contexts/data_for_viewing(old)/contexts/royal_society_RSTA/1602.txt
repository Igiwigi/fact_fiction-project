substituted by the delay term. Moreover, not only the oscillations amplitude is restored, also the
oscillations frequencies of the case without forcing and damping are restored, thanks to the effect
of the conjugate phenomenon.

Then, we have found a critical value of the forcing amplitude, FIY = 2 that switches the system
sensitivity to the forcing frequency towards 2 =2. So that, for F > Fl! the higher oscillations
amplitude are reached for 2 = 2, while for smaller values are reached for 2 =1.

Finally, we proved that the same resonance phenomenon may be used to produce interwell
oscillations for t values inside Regions II and V, for which the oscillations are bounded to one well,
even without dissipation. The forcing amplitude, in these cases, needs to be of a bigger magnitude
to induce the intrawell oscillations. Moreover, the forcing amplitude plays, again, a key role in
the system sensitivity to the forcing frequency for Region IL In fact, we have found a threshold
value of the forcing amplitude, namely F!! ~ 5. For smaller values of the forcing amplitude, the
system resonates for 2 = 1. While for values of F higher than F!!, the resonance frequency is 2 = 2.
Finally, we expect that this work can be useful for a better understanding of the delay-induced
resonance phenomenon in the presence of both dissipation and forcing. On the other hand, Region
V reaches the interwell oscillations for a smaller value of F when the forcing frequency is 2 = 1.
