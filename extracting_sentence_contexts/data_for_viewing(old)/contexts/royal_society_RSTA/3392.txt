(b) The genetic code and the three domains of life

Let us now discuss in more detail the phase diagram of life, as inferred from the numerical
experiments on genetic code evolution. In the days before systematic genomic sequencing was a
possibility, Woese and Fox applied an early technique that allowed them to compare the sequence
of selected short segments of DNA from different organisms [13]. As they were after a way
to classify all forms of life, their analysis was restricted to those genes shared by every cell,
thus underlying the most essential features of biological systems. Eventually, they compared
sequences of a ribosome subunit gene, the 16S rRNA found in prokaryotes, which revealed the
astounding fact that life is separated into three main domains: Bacteria, Archaea and Eukaryota.
This discovery had several paramount consequences across all areas of biology, two of which are
particularly relevant for the remainder of the paper: (i) the fact that species can be operatively
defined on the basis of similarities of the 16S rRNA and (ii) a minimalistic history of life, as
represented in figure 1. The top of the figure shows that, at present day, life is divided into
three domains. Going backward in time, the lineages of the Archaea and the Eukaryota coalesce.
Further backwards, the two main lineages coalesce into the Last Universal Common Ancestor
(LUCA) of all extant life. More about the major evolutionary transitions can be found in [28] and
references therein.

The fact that extant life descended from a single ancestor is suggested by the properties shared
by all organisms on the Earth, and the relatedness identified in the ribosomal tree. In fact, all
life is based on the same nucleic acids, which provide a medium to store genetic information.
The genetic code is almost the same across the three domains. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is
the universal currency for chemical energy and is produced by an enzyme which is universally
