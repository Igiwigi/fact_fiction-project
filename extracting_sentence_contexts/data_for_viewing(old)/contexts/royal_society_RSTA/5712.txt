One of the most appealing features portrayed by TN is the possibility to encode and control 12
global symmetries for the local degrees of freedom that characterize several condensed matter :8
models [24,25]. In fact, a general, robust and numerically efficient formulation of any such : =
symmetries in the TN framework is known; it is commonly used in simulation to achieve 7G

an enhancement of the algorithm performance, as well as precise targeting of irreducible
representation sectors [26-28].

Lattice gauge symmetries differ from global ones, since they have quasi-local supports and are
typically homogeneous, yielding a combined Lie algebra of generators which grows extensively
with the system size [29,30]. Nevertheless, several physical contexts have been found where TN
are an exact description of the ground states of gauge-invariant Hamiltonians (e.g. 2D toric code
that is an Ising gauge theory) [31]. More recently, this framework has been successfully applied
to LGT-related problems. In fact, TN represent microscopically the local Hilbert spaces and at
the same time are tailored on a real-space wave function representation, so they can be used to
