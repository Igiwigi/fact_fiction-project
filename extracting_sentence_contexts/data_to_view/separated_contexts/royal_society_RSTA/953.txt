The formation of the first aggregates, which are much thicker than the rest of the
film, takes place at about 280° C or lower for silver, and at below 400° for gold. This shows that the atoms of the film must be freely mobile at temperatures very
far removed from the melting point, which is 1062° G for gold and 960° C for silver. The fact that during the earlier stages there is little sign of any decrease of intensity
of colour in the film, as seen by transmitted light, in the immediate neighbourhood
of the aggregates, indicates that only the surface layers are concerned, and that
atoms move in from distances which are many times the linear dimensions of the
aggregates. Many other observations point to a lesser mobility of the lower layers of the film. When, at a higher temperature, the windows form, they do not leave the glass bare,
but a film a few atoms thick remains, from which crystalline particles can be formed
at a definitely higher temperature, ¢.g., about 420° C for silver.
