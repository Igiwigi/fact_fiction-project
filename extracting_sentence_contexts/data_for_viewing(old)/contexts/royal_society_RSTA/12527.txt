position inside the Leyden jar.

The method ordinarily adopted for clamping the needle consists in passing a screw
through a loop in the aluminium wire connecting the mirror with the needle, and
screwing this screw into the insulated framework supporting the apparatus.

There is not much difficulty in putting in this screw by means of the square headed
screwdriver provided with the instrument, but there is the greatest difficulty in

removing the screw without breaking the fibres. In fact, the danger of breaking the
fibres when making one of the adjustments above referred to without previously
clamping the needle is hardly greater than the danger of breaking them when
removing the clamping screw.

We, therefore, had fitted to the electrometer the device which is seen in fig. 1* for
easily raising and lowering the needle. JZ is a circular piece of metal turning eccen-
trically about a pin fixed to a small plate pp, which can slide up and down at the back
of the insulated support SS. This plate pp carries two little hooks hh, which, on being
raised by turning the eccentric H (by means of the square screwdriver provided with
the electrometer), lift up the T-piece Â¢ at the top of the suspension, and take the
weight of the mirror, the needle, and its attachment, off the silk fibres. When then
it is desired to remove the interior of the electrometer out of the Leyden jar, all that
