the influence of molecular constitution on the phenomena, of radiation and absorp-
tion. Encountered continually by the thought that in liquids and solids the pure
molecular action was, or might be, hampered by cohesion, the desire to bring, if possible,
free molecules under the dominion of experiment beset me more and more.
At the beginning of 1859 T definitely attacked this problem, meeting at the outset
difficulties and negations the reverse of encouraging. But after some weeks of labour,
T found myself in secure possession. of the result that gases and vapours exhibited, in
Telation to radiant heat, phenomena far more surprising than those observed by
Merzoxt in liquids and solids. On the 26th of May 1859 the subject was brought
Dpfore the Royal Society,* and on the 10th of June I was able, by illuminating the
Yal of a galvanometer and casting its image upon a screen, to demonstrate in the
Boyul Institution not only the fact of absorption, but the astonishing differences of
zhsorption which gases and vapours equally transparent to light manifested in regard

DThe following gases and vapours were then examined:—Air, oxygen, hydrogen,
Ftrogen, carbonic oxide, carbonic acid, nitrous oxide, coal gas, ammonia, olefiant gas,
Ezulphide of carbon, chloroform, benzol, iodide of ethyl, cyanide of ethyl, formate of
#hyl, acetate of ethyl, propionate of ethyl, iodide of amyl, chloride of amyl, amyline,
olute alcohol, amylic alcohol, methylic alcohol, ethylic ether, ethylamylic ether,
phuric ether, and some others. In the Philosophical Magazine for 1862 I have
Sven samples of the results obtained with a few of these substances ; and I will here
wnfine myself to the remark that were the measurements there recorded multiplied a
Bindred-fold, they would fall far short of the number actually executed in 1859.
