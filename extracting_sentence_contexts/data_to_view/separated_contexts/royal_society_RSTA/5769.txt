But what are the (compact, connected, orientable) 3-manifolds available for consideration? This question has been profoundly clarified in recent years by the dramatic progress on lower-
dimensional topology made possible through the advancements in Ricci flow [4,5]. One now
knows for example that, since the Poincaré conjecture has finally been proven, any such
3-manifold M that is in fact simply connected must be diffeomorphic to the ordinary 3-sphere
S°. Setting aside this so-called ‘trivial’ manifold the remaining possibilities consist of an infinite
list of non-trivial manifolds, each of which is diffeomorphic (designated herein by ~) to a finite
connected sum of the following form:

3 st
M~ pit ene x S$!) #.4(S? x S!)#K(z, 1)1#.4#K(20, Dn (1.1)
1 k


Here k,] and m are integers > 0, k + 1+ m>1 and if either k, | or m is 0 then terms of that type do
not occur. The connected sum M#N of two closed connected, oriented n-manifolds is constructed
by removing the interiors of an embedded closed n-ball in each of M and N and then identifying
the resulting S"-! boundary components by an orientation-reversing diffeomorphism.
