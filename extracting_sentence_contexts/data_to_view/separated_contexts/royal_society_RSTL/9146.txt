WITH THE TIDES OF A VISCOUS SPHEROID. 553

we should, therefore, have to equibrate the system by bodily forces arising from the
effects of the inertia due to the uniform precession and the fortnightly nutationâ€”just
as was done above with the tidal friction. This would be an exceedingly laborious
process ; and although ib seems certain that the tides thus raised would be very small,
yet we are fortunately able to satisfy ourselves of the fact more rigorously. Certain
parts of the tangential stresses do form an equibrating system of forces, and these are
precisely those parts of the stresses which are the most important, because they do not
involve the xine of the obliquity. T shall therefore evaluate the tangential stresses when the obliquity is zero.
