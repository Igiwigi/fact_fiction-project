precision. The results of all measurements made in air must be reduced to some
standard condition, and the differences between the results of such measurements, when
reduced respectively to “ standard” air or to vacuum, will be constant and correct to

the accuracy to which the refractive index of “ standard ” air is known at the time when
they are made. i

An important advantage of the definition in vacuum arises from the fact that it 1s
possible to make, if desired, primary determinations of lengths and wave-numbers
by direct measurement in vacuum, thereby avoiding all complications associated with
the refraction and dispersion of air.

It is considered, therefore, that the weight of ultimate advantage is greatly in favour
of adopting a wave-length in vacuum as the basis of definition for the units of length.

It will be understood from the foregoing that the establishment of a wave-length
definition for the unit of length, whether in air or in vacuum, requires for its satisfactory
completion new and more precise determinations of the refraction and dispersion of air,
including also a complete examination of the influence of the variable atmospheric
factors, viz., temperature, pressure, humidity, and carbon dioxide content, on these
