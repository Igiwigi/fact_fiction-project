thrown by cortical excitation into violent spasm.

(5.) In addition to the above, the whole mass of results to be detailed in this and
the succeeding chapters is convincing evidence of the truth of our interpretation,
since, as will be seen by separating the fibres in the two sides of the cord (longitudinal
section), by interrupting the fibres on one side only (hemisection), &c., we obtained a
differentiation in our results which admits of no other explanation than the one
upon which we base our deductions, namely, that the electrical effects observed are
due to changes localised in the exposed cord, and, moreover, in the experiments
under discussion localised particularly in the nerve fibres which form the pyramidal
tracts.

The fact above alluded to of the absence of electrical effects in the dorsal cord when
the area for the upper limb was excited in the Monkey, involves matters of such
importance that we now pass on to consider it in some detail.

(c.) Lhe Localisation of Efferent Representation in the Cortex as ascertained by the
Electrical Method.

It was clear from the commencement of this research, that our method afforded
means of differentiating the centres in the cortex and their correlated fibres in the
spinal cord. We accordingly made observations of the following character :â€”

Having exposed the cortex freely,.and connected, as before, the cut dorsal cord with
the electrometer, we proceeded to obtain the usual result by exciting the lower
