In general, these expressions do not have any advantage over the more general representation
(3.20). Nevertheless, they have an interesting implication: in fact, they suggest that one could
approximate the inverse Langevin function 2% —l(x) within a range of interest in terms of a
weighted sum of powers which are odd multiples of 1/£, i.e. YH wjx2-D/b, so as to obtain an
Ogden-type model with only integer powers. Such a model would bring advantages in terms
of the numerical treatment, since its strain-energy function could be represented in terms of
principal traces of C; see also [15].

Further close relatives are obtained by consideration of some of the various rational function
approximations proposed for 2 —1 For example, using Cohen’s rounded Padé approximant [81]
