glance too difficult to solve. The ISO must decide every day the dispatch for the next day, and
calculations need to be done reliably in a relatively short time. This is usually addressed following
two different approaches.

One possibility is to use Lagrangian relaxation as in (3.1) and solve the dual of the UC
described in §a. This is advocated in [9,10], for example. The main idea is that the dual
problem has a nice structure, being amenable to be solved using non-smooth convex optimization
methods. Another major advantage of this approach is that the computational effort scales
moderately with the problem size [11]. This property may become increasingly important as
the time step length in the UC problem decreases, to better deal with renewable uncertainty.
Additionally, as mentioned, the computed dual solution gives a price signal with minimal uplifts.

In fact, Electricité de France has a long tradition of using Lagrangian relaxation, that goes
back to the seminal work [12]. The approach continues to be used nowadays, adapted to the
market setting, to compute half-hour dispatch and prices [13]. Due to the constraints on the
operational process in France, the problem needs to be solved in less than 10 min, with very
strong requirements both on optimality and feasibility (all schedules must be feasible and a 1%
gap adds up into several millions of euros per year). In this setting, the separable structure of
the dual function in (3.1) can be exploited by an iterative procedure based on decomposition,
that maximizes the dual function. Because the dual function is concave but non-smooth, special
techniques must be put in place, that guarantee accuracy and robustness. Bundle algorithms for
non-smooth minimization are the methods of choice in this case, ([14], Part II). We do not enter
into further details here. For other success stories of decomposition methods applied to energy
optimization, we refer to [15] and the many references therein.
