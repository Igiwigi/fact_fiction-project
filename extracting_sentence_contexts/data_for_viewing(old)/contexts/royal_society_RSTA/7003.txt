@existing Asdic installation, the same transmitter, receiver and recorder being used for both;
a change-over switch made it possible to use either the Asdic oscillator or the echo-sounding
‘oscillator. The effective beam width was about 25° and the power during transmission some
5 50 W, giving an axial pressure of 5 x 10 dyne-cm.~? yards. Measurements of echo strength
5 received from a depth of 2600 fathoms gave a mean pressure of 0-28 dyne/cm.? Assuming
2 that the bottom was a perfect reflector, and that no other losses were present, the echo
Zz strength should have been 4-8 dynes/cm.? The difference can be accounted for by an
8 attenuation loss of about 2 db./kiloyard.

2 The figures quoted above represent good conditions in the Atlantic. On the edge of the
8 continental shelf, where gradients of up to 1 in 5 are experienced and the bottom is ex-
2 tremely irregular, it was sometimes difficult to record echoes at all. This was attributed to
ey the fact that the echoes were very much drawn out. Although it is estimated that under
> these conditions the maximum pressure did not exceed 0-02 dynes/cm.?, it was always
= possible to get a sounding, and at the majority of stations excellent records were obtained.

3 It is clearly desirable to know the positions of stations as accurately as possible, but for
® gravity measurement the latitude and the east-west velocity during each dive are the im-
§ portant quantities. At latitude 50° gravity increases by 1-5 mgals/mile north. The latitude
& of each station is therefore required to within about 1 min. of arc. Under good conditions,
this can be obtained by star sights or from observations of the sun near local noon. The
conning tower of a submarine only gives a height of eye of some 20 ft., so that it is seldom
that the sea is calm enough to give a good horizon. Weather conditions are frequently poor,
