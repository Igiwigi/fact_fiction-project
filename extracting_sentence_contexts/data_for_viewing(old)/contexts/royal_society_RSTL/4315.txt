they are by the moon, or even more. At these places we should obtain no intelligible
result by referring them to the moon alone. Again, in other places the lunitidal
interval is affected by a large inequality which makes it alternately greater and less :
for instance, in successive tides it is, (in minutes,)

30, 150, 60, 180, 30, 210,

and 80 on. Now what $hall we say is the © establighment” in such a case? If we
take the © corrected establishment,” as I have defined it (the mean interval), it is 110” ;
but this is not an approximate value for any single tide. If we take the three smaller
intervals, which may happen to be the day tides, we have, for the mean, 40”; if we
take the three others, we have 180, or three hours. And if we use the common
* establishment,” the confusion is still greater. The fact is, that in snch cases the
term © establishment” loses all definite meaning, as I have already observed*, It
cannot be of use, either in expressing the laws of the tides at any one place, or the
mode of transmission of the tide from one place to another. The former subject, the
law of the diurnal inequality of the tides at a particular place, I have been able to
assign for several places, and in some degree, in general. The latter, the mode in
which the diurnal and the semidiurnal wave are transmitted and continued, is a
more difficult question. I shall however add a few words on each of these points.

22. Before I quit the subject of cotidal lines, I may remark, that Capt. FrrzRoy
has pointed out the difficulties which attend the representation of the tides of the
Atlantic and Pacific by means of cotidal lines, and has suggested a © libration or
oscillation” of the ocean as hetter explaining the phenomena4, I had already, in
