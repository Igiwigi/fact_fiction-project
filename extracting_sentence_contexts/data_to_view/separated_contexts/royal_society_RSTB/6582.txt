I have not previously seen, either in the brain of the Chinese or the Australian,
an arrangement of the sulci on the medial surface comparable with S.11.R. The
great interest lies in its comparison with the Gorilla’s brain mentioned above. When the facts concerning the medial occipital region are summarized and
compared with the types seen in the Southern Chinese, the features distinguishing
the aboriginal Australian stand out. The open condition of the fossa parieto-occi-
pitalis characterizing the first two groups is present in 45°, of the Australian hemi-
spheres, and in 10% of the Chinese. There are 27°, showing the vertical type of
folding in the Australian, and 6% in the Chinese ; and finally the formation of a
fissura parieto-occipitalis characterizing group 6 is present in 17%, of the Australian

brains, and in 69°, of the Chinese.
