(a) Issues with cross-sectional samples

Cross-sectional samples, while highly informative, preclude
any kind of causal interpretation regarding the relationship
between fertility and wealth. Most importantly, one cannot
exclude the possibility of reverse causality: income in later
life may reflect the influence of parenthood, rather than
vice versa. Indeed, empirical evidence suggests that women
suffer a significant loss of earnings after the birth of a child
([48]; an ‘opportunity cost’ that features heavily in Becker's
US-based economic theory of fertility). Some of these effects
probably reflect the fact that many societies conform to a
‘male breadwinner’ model, where female income makes
only a small contribution to household income (something
exacerbated by early-twentieth century employment policies:
in the Netherlands and the UK civil service, for example,
women were required to resign from their jobs when they
married). Additionally, women who intend to have (many)
children, or those that have recently entered motherhood,
may choose less-demanding, lower-paying jobs [49]. Such
effects make it difficult to use income measured at a single
point (usually at the end of the reproductive lifespan) to caus-
ally predict the number of children born. Cross-sectional
relationships between female income and completed fertility
