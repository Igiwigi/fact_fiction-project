been made by a simple procedure first developed by Emerson & Diehl [14]. Frogs are weighed and
then placed ‘head-up’ on a smooth surface on a rotation platform that is rotated slowly from 0°
(horizontal), through 90° (vertical) to 180° (upside-down). The angles at which the frog falls from
the surface (fall angle) are recorded. These fall angles are used to calculate maximum adhesive
forces by simple trigonometry [32]. If the total toe pad area is also measured, these values can be
converted to the force per unit area that toe pads can generate. Figure 10a shows the masses of
14 different frog species (12 of which were hylids). Measured total toe pad areas of these same
frogs appear in figure 10b, while angles of fall from the rotation platform for these 14 frog species
(means of 10 measurements for each frog) are plotted in figure 11c. Since frogs have an area-
based adhesive system (the toe pads), it is unsurprising that larger (and hence heavier) species
fall from the platform at lower angles. From this information, the force per unit area of these
toe pads can be calculated (figure 11d). The positive slope of the line of best fit, though small, is
statistically significant (r = 0.68; d.f. = 11; p < 0.05), and reflects the fact that larger tree frogs have
more efficient toe pads. A similar study, but looking at the effects of growth on adhesion of these
same species [43], shows similar effects, toe pads becoming more structurally complex as the frogs
grow. Close examination of the behaviour of tree frogs during such tilting experiments [42,44]
demonstrates that tree frogs have evolved special strategies to maintain adhesion on overhanging
surfaces. As the angle of tilt increases, tree frogs spread their limbs out sideways, and to a more
limited extent, forwards or backwards as well. As figure 11 shows, this reduces the angle of
