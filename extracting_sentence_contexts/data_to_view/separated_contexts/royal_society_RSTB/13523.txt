Hence, this approach does not rely on the

it is important to keep in mind that biomechanical constraints assumption about the coupling of a secondary process with


the internally represented metric pulses. Rather, it is based on
the assumption that the internal representation of a pulse is
encoded in the dynamic fluctuations of neural activity that
can be measured using neuroscientific methods [34,66-69]. The fact that neural activity can be captured at multiple spatial
scales, and in a number of ways (e.g. as single-unit firing
rates, population trajectories, amplitude modulations of
band-limited local field potentials or large-scale electroenceph-
alogram (EEG) activity), may provide complementary insights
into the way metric pulses are represented in the nervous
system, and into the nature of the transformation processes
that support the mapping between internal representations of
metric pulses and the sensory input [29,46,67,70-72]. Using this approach is valid even for neural signals of
complex physiological origin (such as EEG) that probably
reflect a mixture of lower- and higher-level processes related
to the internal representation of the sensory input [29,73,74]. While such signals cannot be expected to directly isolate
neural representation of metric pulses, they can be assumed
to be systematically influenced by this representation.
