where p is the density function of the measure ju. Therefore, minimizers of the energy (4.3)
on the set of probability measures should be among the most stable configurations. Finally, let
us comment that both the non-local diffusion equation (3.2) and its rescaled version (3.4) are
particular instances of the aggregation equation (4.4) for suitably chosen potentials W. We will see
in the rest of this section a summary of the results concerning the minimizers of the interaction
energy (4.3), especially in its relation to free boundary problems, particularly to the obstacle
problem.

(i) Connection to optimal transport

We start by noting that the discrete system (4.2) has the structure of a gradient flow with respect
to the Euclidean distance. In fact, this structure is shared by the continuum equation (4.4) in
a suitable sense. We need to be precise about the definition of distance between probability
measures. We recall that P(RY) is the set of Borel probability measures on RN and we denote
by B(RY) the family of Borel subsets of RY. The support of a measure 1 € P(R) is the closed set
defined by

supp() := {x € RN : (B(x, €)) > 0 for all e > 0}.

A family of distances between probability measures has been classically introduced by means of
optimal transport theory. We will review briefly some of these concepts; we refer to [57] for further
details. A probability measure z on the product space RN x RY is said to be a transference plan
between pz € P(RN) and v € P(RY) if
