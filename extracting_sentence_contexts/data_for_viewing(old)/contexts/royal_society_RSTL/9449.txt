the cause is the same, viz. : that the external actions are not of the 8uitable strength,
or the internal conditions are not snch as to permit the effect upon the discharge to
exist in all its completeness.

We &ee, then, that observation of the relief-effects enables us to determine the
terminal from which the discharge proceeds, and the distance it goes without pro-

 voking a response from the other terminal. And this method shows us that in the
ordinary case of the air-spark discharge it passes right through the tube before this
Â© response comes, if in fact ib can be said to come at all. One of the most important
consequences that necessarily follows from this is that the discharges at the two
terminals of the tube are entirely independent, and are primarily determined each by
the conditions at its own terminal and only in a secondary degree, if at all, by the
conditions that exist at the opposite terminal. We shall hereafter recur to this point,
and shall show still more conclusively the complete independence of the discharge at
either terminal of a tube, but ib will be well to call attention here to the very
Qmportant consequences that flow from this principle. Since the discharges are
Snot identically the same at both terminals, the tube must contain different free charges
Sit different times.* Tt is therefore in no respect like a conductor, but is an indepen-
ent; electrical system, holding much the same position as the air-vessel in a forcing-
Epump. All the electricity that comes into it goes out again, but the truth of this can
Epnly be asserted when we consider the whole discharge from the beginning to the end,
