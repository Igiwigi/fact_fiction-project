and Professor Swinnerton has assumed that the erosion through the two corresponding
coastal peats at Chapel Point was caused by the fact that the subsidence, in its early
stages, brought within reach of the tidal oscillation ground previously out of reach of
it. We find it difficult, however, to accept this hypothesis for the very wide area of the
fens in which these erosion phenomena are found.


402 H. GODWIN AND M. H. CLIFFORD, STUDIES OF THE

Wetness and dryness

We have already noted that interpretation of Fenland history is complicated by the
fact that dryness and wetness of the surface is affected by the operation of at least
three major factors—climate, relative movement of land and sea, and the natural
successional tendencies of vegetation. The last factor can usually be estimated, but the
relative importance to be attached to each of the two former is both important and
difficult to decide. We have therefore given one column of the table to a statement of
the wetness or dryness of the fen surface at any period, and in the following columns
have added information as to the extent to which climate, on the one hand, or land and
sea movement, on the other, are likely to have been involved.

On the extreme right are given the classical climatic periods of Blytt and Sernander
and the conditions they were held to show in Scandinavia, also the later conclusions
of Granlund—especially with regard to the main “recurrence surfaces” in raised
bogs. These are well-marked phases of arrested growth and can be taken to correspond
