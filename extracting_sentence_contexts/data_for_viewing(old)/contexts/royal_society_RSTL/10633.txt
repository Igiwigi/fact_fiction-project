It would thus seem that the angular gyrus is in relation to both eyes, and that
though usually the eross effect is the only pronounced one, yet the direct one may be

t previously. (See Experiment 5*.) The absolutely negative character of the

bsequent extension of the lesions into the anterior parts of the occipital lobes was
also a remarkable fact in this case.

Experiment 5* (Plate 20, fig. 7).

In this animal the left angular gyrus was exposed in the usual manner, and caute-

rised with the galvanic cautery.

The left eye was secured, and the animal allowed to recover from stupor.
