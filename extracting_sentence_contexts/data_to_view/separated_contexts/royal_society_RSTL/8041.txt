The equation of the cyclide referred to the contre of F as origin is given by the following symmetrical
equation :
(#+/f +2 —227(4+1+1)—21y\(—I*+1)—22(@+1—If)

Tho sections by the planes y=0, :=0 are evidently the tyo pairs of circles

(v+1Y +Y=(a+1Y, (a= +y=(a—17;

six equations of condition are implied by the fact of the four circles being mutually
orthogonal, and the identical relation «*+83*+/*+2*=0 (for constants are incorporated)
is equivalent to one condition. Hence the given form contains eight independent
constants ; and this is the number which determines a sphero-quartic.
