ReGcxavir's investigations have shown that, NEUMANN's law is not rigidly valid. Even
for those compounds which contain the same- element. as electronegative constituent,
and have similar atomic constitution, he found the atomic heats as much as 45 to 4 dif-
ferent from each other*. The reason of this he seeks in the same cireumstances, which
in his view prevent a closer agreement in the atomic weights of the elements (com-
pare & 92).

Differences of this kind, and even still more considerable, occur in the atomic heats
of compounds for which greater agreement in these numbers might be expected—of
8uch compounds,”that is, as contain elements of the same, or almost the same atomic heat
combined with the same other element in the same atomic proportion. To this belongs
the fact that the atomic heat has been fonnd s0 different ($ 85) for the isxomorphous com-
pounds, magnetic iron ore (37-7), chrome iron ore (31:2), and spinelle (27-7), and for
alumina (21-3) and for sesquioxide of iron (26:8). In the atomic heats of 8uch analogous
compounds there are differences for which, or rather for the magnitude of which, as
furnished by our present. observations, I know at present no adequate explanation.

But there is another kind of difference in the atomic heats of analogous compounds,
which exhibits a regularity, and for which an explanation can be given. Certain
elements impress on all their compounds the common characteristic, that their atomic
heat is much 8smaller than that of most analogous compounds. The atomic heat of
boracic acid, B, O,, is only 16-6, while that of most other compounds, R, 0, and R, O,, is
2 between 25 and 28 (4 85). The atomic heat of the borates, RB O,, is ($ 8T) only 16-8,
while that of R, O,, as the mean of the determinations in { 85, is 22'2. The atomic
