shown that he was deceived in- this inference, the heart being immediately subject
to the influence of the spinal marrow ; and the latter author further inferred from
his experiments that the spinal marrow is not only capable of directly influencing
the heart through its nerves, but that, through the same channel, it bestows on
both the heart and blood-vessels all their powers; an inference refuted both by ex-
periments already referred to, and others, an account of which appeared in the Phi-
losophical Transactions for 1815 and has since been republished in my Inquiry into
the Laws of the Vital Functions; and some of which were at the request of the Royal
Society repeated with the same results by Mr. CLiyr, Mr. Cuer's confirmation of
them being published in the same volume of the Transactions.

The circumstance of the brain and spinal marrow only, as we shall find, influencing
the heart under peculiar circumstances is probably the cause of the fact ascertained
by Haurzs, that it cannot be excited through its nerves in the same way as a muscle
of voluntary motion, an observation which applies to all muscles of involuntary mo-
tion, a want of attention to which has misled some physiologistsF.

From the whole of the experiments which have been referred to, it appears, on the
one hand, that neither the brain nor spinal marrow bestows any power on the heart
or vessels ; but, on the other, that each of the former organs is equally capable of di-
rectly influencing both, (the vessels even to their utmost extremities) and that, not only
by exciting their powers, but also by impairing and even wholly destroying them, ac-
cording to the nature and power of the agent operating on the brain or spinal marrow z
