the vascular canals and spaces ; and in Bipalivm, as will be een in the 8equel, what,
was believed to be the neryous system was found to occupy such a position. It is an interesting fact, and I believe new to science, that there exist Planarians
which contain in their body-fluids hemoglobin, I detected this substance by means of
the spectroscope in a small Planarian, apparently a species of Derostomum (Scuanpa,
Neue wirb. Thiere, Band i. Hiilfte i. Taf. i. fig. 8), which I found infesting in considerable
abundance the surface of the integument of an echinoderm, one of the Clypeastride, Ag.,
which abounds at Suez.
