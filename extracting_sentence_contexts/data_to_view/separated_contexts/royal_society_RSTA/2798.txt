These studies therefore call into
question plateaux formation due to lower crustal flow (i.e. downwelling) and inlier formation via
plateau collapse, regardless of the crustal thickening mechanism. A ‘pulsating continents’ model called on a weak crust to form crustal plateaux and tessera
inliers [78]. However, this model fails to address how continents initially form, steep-sided
plateau topography, the fact that weak lower crust cannot support high topography, the similar
character of ribbon structures in crustal plateaux and lowland inliers, and the lack of evidence of
plateau collapse within inliers. The character of ribbon-tesserae [62,69,71,79,80], is also difficult to address within the context
of the above models, as briefly reviewed here (figure 4c-e) [69]. Tesserae, marked by orthogonal
folds and extensional structures, resembles pahoehoe flow surfaces except for scale.
