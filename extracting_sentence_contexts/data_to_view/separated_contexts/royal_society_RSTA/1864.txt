the base of the projectile is known, and also its velocity and final position. For other
points % and 3 have to be found to make both «, and ¢ correct : the adjustment is facili-
tated by the fact that uniform division of #, corresponds approximately to uniform
division of ¢. At the junction (x, = 4c) ¢ = 0, and at the base of the projectile (x, = 0)
@ = —0-019578. Taking four values of ¢ equally spaced between these, and finding
3 to give the correct t, we have four points which correspond nearly to 10, 20, 30 and
40 per cent. division of the initial gas, and are easily adjusted to exact value by inter-
polation.
