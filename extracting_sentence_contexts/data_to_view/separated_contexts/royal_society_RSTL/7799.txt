WiLDE; p is a smooth surface or cast from which the actual root has
been separated, but the latter remains in it at p'. At its extremity it appears to
have divided into several slightly diverging branches, or, what is possible, its branched
portion may have been broken off and the part left split by pressure. Two points are
clearly indicated by this instructive example :—1st, the cast of the root is perfectly 8mooth,
exhibiting none of the ridges and furrows which are s0 strongly marked on the inter-
nodes (&) of the parent stem ; 2nd, these ridges and furrows pursue their course right
across the base of the root, almost entirely undisturbed by its close contact with them,
'These two facts seem to indicate that the root is an adventitious structure, and that
if it received any vessels from the woody zone they were few in number, and did not
exist as a cylindrical prolongation of the exogenous woody axis of the stem into the
root, as would be the case in a recent phanerogamous Exogen. 'That these roots branch
at their extremities into the plants known as Pinnulariz appears to be established on
the testimony of 80 many observers that no grounds exist for doubting the correctness
of the conclusion, though IT have had no opportunity of verifying it. A much more difficult question to be determined is the nature and position of the
atrial branches. When we obtain specimens in which subterranean rhizomes are directly
prolonged into atrial stems, we find that the large phragmata or cicatriculee, seen in
Plate XX VII. figs. 31, 32 & 33, give place to others similarly located, but becoming very
much smaller in size as s00n as the stem emerged from the ground.
