As the cooling of hot bodies is 80 much accelerated by covering
their surfaces with such substances as emit calorific rays in great
abundance, or with such as are much affected by the Å¿rigorific
rays of the colder bodies by which they are surrounded, it seems
tobe highly probable, that a comparatively small part of the
heat, which a body s0 cooled actually loses, is acquired by the
air; a much greater proportion of it passing off through that
transparent fluid, under the form of calorific rays, without af-
fecting its temperature.

If this supposition should turn out to be well founded, the
knowledge of the fact would enable us to explain several inte-
resting phenomena, and particularly that most curious process
by means of which living animals preserve an equal temperature,
notwithstanding the vast quantities of heat that are continually
generated in the lungs, and notwithstanding the great variations
which take place in the temperature of-the air in which they
live.

It is evident, that the greater the power .is which an animal
possesses of throwing off heat from-the surface of his body, inde-
pendently of that which the surrounding air takes off, the less
will his temperature be affected bythe occasional changes of
