Participants gener-
ated features of emotional concepts (e.g. FRUSTRATION) by
thinking of and listing associated properties, while facial
EMG was recorded. Crucially though, depending on con-
dition, participants were informed that the features were
being produced either for an audience that was interested
in emotional ‘hot’ features of the concepts (like a good
friend with whom they have a close relationship and can
share anything), or for an audience interested in more factual
‘cold’ features of the emotion concepts (like a supervisor with
whom they have a formal relationship). Participants were
able to produce normatively appropriate emotion features
in both the ‘hot’ and ‘cold’ conditions—reflecting deep pro-
cessing. However, the EMG showed that there was greater
activation of the facial muscles when participants were
asked for features of emotion words in the ‘hot’ compared
with the ‘cold’ audience condition.
