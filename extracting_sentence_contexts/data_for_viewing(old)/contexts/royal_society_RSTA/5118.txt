to further its author reputation and was in any case well out of date by then. It has been said that
if this table had come to light earlier, it might have made a difference in the priority dispute that
Lothar Meyer had with Mendeleev. Lothar Meyer’s table appears to be more consistent and more
accurate than Mendeleev’s including the correct placement of mercury with cadmium, tin with
lead and thallium with boron, none of which Mendeleev carried out.

Finally, another symptom of multiple discovery is the frequent occurrence of bitter priority
disputes, precisely as witnessed in the case of Lothar Meyer and Mendeleev over many
years [18,19] (figure 6).

9. Mendeleev

Dimitri Mendeleev was in fact the last of the six co-discoverers of the periodic system and
could benefit from the work of the earlier five pioneers (figure 7). The case is often made that
5There is no denying the fact that the three earliest pioneers, De Chancourtois, Newlands and Hinrichs, were all outsiders

or even amateurs and that the more professional chemists only entered the arena in the final stages of the 7-year period of
discovery.
