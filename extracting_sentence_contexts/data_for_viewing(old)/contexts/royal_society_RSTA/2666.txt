(c) Magma convection

Persistent degassing is commonly observed at basaltic volcanoes including Etna, Stromboli,

Villarrica and Erebus, where conduit magma convection is often considered to be the degassing : =
mechanism [20-24]. Significant and persistent degassing also occurs in silicic volcanoes during :e
quiescent periods between eruptions [25-27]. However, intuition would lead most to believe 7S
that viscous silicic magma volcanoes are less likely to have complicated convection flow patterns —
that would promote degassing because the magma pathways within are often quite narrow. So, —
researchers began to question how this degassing may then take place. Fluid-dynamic evaluations : a
have demonstrated that viscous magma can in fact flow through a conduit measuring 100m : -
in diameter rapidly enough to cause persistent degassing [27,28], but the existence of such a : =
wide magma column at a shallow depth in a silicic volcano was unproven. Therefore, when [4
Shionahara & Tanaka [29] confirmed the presence of a low-density vesiculated magma at a : =
depth of only 100m from the summit crater floor of Satsuma-Iwojima volcano based on the :3
data obtained by Tanaka et al. [5], it helped to explain the dynamics of the degassing process : =

of this particular volcano. It was concluded that Satsuma-Iwojima volcano had conduit magma
convection dynamics occurring within rhyolitic magma inside the cone.

Muographic research is intrinsically highly multidisciplinary. Owing to the wide range of
measurement techniques and attributes, it is not surprising that muography investigators come
from many disciplines including physics, geology and civil engineering to name a few. With such
