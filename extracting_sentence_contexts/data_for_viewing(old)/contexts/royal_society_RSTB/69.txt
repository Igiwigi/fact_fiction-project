are points of divergence. Analysis of the spontaneous beat both by mechanical and
by electrical methods brings these into evidence. The diphasic variation of the spon-
taneously beating Frog’s heart is uniformly indicative of negativity of base, followed
by negativity of apex; to this we add the statement that muscular contraction of
base precedes, and is followed by, muscular contraction of apex. All our experiments
and measurements are thus confirmatory of the doctrine that the contraction takes
place from base to apex, and that the wave of excitation and of contraction takes place
by muscular channels. It is otherwise with regard to the Mammal heart. The variation
is not always diphasic; immediately after excision it is more frequently monophasic
and thereafter becomes diphasic. The movement of galvanometer and electrometer
indicates for the monophasic variation negativity predominant either at apex or at
base ; for the diphasic variation (when it is present) negativity of apex, followed by
negativity of base, or the reverse. There is no constant rule, in fact, and we saw no
use in further multiplying observations, seeing that we had to do with the irregulari-

ties due to an excessive susceptibility to local injury ; of such susceptibility we had
abundant evidence ; the delirium, which is so apt to supervene, is its extreme instance.

We see no escape from the conclusion that the Mammalian ventricle is an organ
not only controlled by nerves, but also co-ordinated as to the action of its several parts
