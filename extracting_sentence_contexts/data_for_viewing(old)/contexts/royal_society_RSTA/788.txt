hand side. In terms of the state, we can use the ‘partial inner product’ operation described, for
example, in [35, p. 129] to apply the eigenvectors corresponding to the chosen values for the
other 1 — 3 parties to |G), resulting in a three-qubit pure state that is LC-equivalent to the GHZ
state.

From this theorem, we immediately obtain the following corollaries:

Corollary 4.6. A graph state |G) is strongly contextual if and only if G has a vertex of degree at least 2.
Corollary 4.7. Every strongly contextual three-qubit stabilizer state is LC-equivalent to the GHZ state.

The graph theoretic arguments used in the proof of the AvN triple theorem present some
similarities to the techniques developed in [37] to derive Bell inequalities that are maximally
violated by some graph states. In fact, corollary 4.6 also follows from theorem 1 in [37]. However, it
is important to note that the AvN triple theorem goes beyond the graph-state formalism to expose
the underlying algebraic structure of AVN arguments, which ultimately rests on AvN triples.

“The notation in (4.3) indicates that ¢“ =X, g“ =" =Z, and g" is either Z or I for every other vertex z € V \ {u, v,w}, and
analogously for the other lines.

5This is actually the application of a linear map to a vector under map-state duality [36].
