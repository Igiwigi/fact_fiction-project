3. Convergence to equilibrium

In this section, we discuss a few sufficient criteria for a positive and irreducible semigroup
to converge as time tends to infinity. We have to distinguish between uniform convergence—i.e.


convergence in operator norm—and strong convergence. As before, E denotes a Banach lattice.
Several examples will be discussed in §4 and §6.

(a) The limit operator

We first recall a few general facts about the limit operator of a convergent semigroup. By the fixed
space of a semigroup S on E we mean the set of all vectors f € E such that S(t)f =f for all times tf.
The dual semigroup of a semigroup S on E is the mapping S’: (0,00) 3 th S(t)’ € L(E’).

Proposition 3.1. Let S be a semigroup on E and assume that, for each f € E, S(t)f converges to a vector
Pf as t > oo. Then:

(a) The semigroup S is bounded; the limit operator P is a continuous linear operator on E and a
projection (i.e. P? = P) that commutes with every operator S(t).

(b) The range of P is the fixed space of S and the range of the dual operator P’ is the fixed space of the
dual semigroup S! on E’.
