vehicles [1]. Coordination polymers and MOFs are
prepared from the combination of metal cations,
commonly d- or f-block metals, and ligands capable of
bridging metal centres to create polymeric structures
which extend in one, two or three dimensions. The
key features of coordination networks and MOFs that

the careful chemist can use relatively robust and
predictable coordination bonds to position different
components of a polymeric framework structure with
respect to one another. This important feature of MOFs
allows researchers to manipulate structures at the
molecular level within polymeric framework structures
and hence to modify the properties of the resulting
materials. It is this basic premise which underscores the
contribution and promise of MOFs in so many fields.
