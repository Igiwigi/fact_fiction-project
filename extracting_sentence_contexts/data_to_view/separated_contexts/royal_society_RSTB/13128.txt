Figure 2. Biological mechanisms facilitating versus suppressing within-

condensation in developing sperm would largely silence gene
expression (e.g. [31]), and that cytoplasmic bridges between
spermatids would essentially homogenize any potential
remaining differences [32]. The very fact that sperm are so
small may be related to avoiding selfish genetic (cytoplasmic)
elements acting in sperm [33], and the evolution of other
aspects of spermatogenesis may have been fuelled
by intragenomic conflict with selfish genetic elements [34]. Nevertheless, there is now ample evidence for post-meiotic
transcription [7,32,35,36] and many transcripts are not equally
shared via cytoplasmic bridges [37-40]. Ways for males to con-
