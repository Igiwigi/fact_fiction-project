It follows that

Next consider the contribution to F of the irrotational solutions.
‘1
If ¢=0(5),

then (uy, 21, &%) = o(f),

and it is clear that

lim {| (lu, + m'v, + n'w,) d= = 0.

It follows that the only solution which contributes to F is that corresponding to the
value

a
$ = a =—. In this case we have
{{. (U'u, + m'v, + n'w,) d= = — {[. 2 as ie 8 ss ed)

It is now necessary to consider at some length the contribution of the special solutions
to F. This part of the work is complicated by the fact that the functions R,” (cos 6)
become infinite when 6 = 0. Consider first the contribution of these solutions to i{, lu, d=. Corresponding to

the value
