Thus the most accurate information on the subject is probably that
derivable from the data in the last line of Table TV. The ratios between the successive
maximum ordinates deduced from the data in question are as follows :—

Primary. | First associated. | Second associated. | Third associated,

1 s 0-284 : 0-191 : 0-096

The maximum ordinates of the first, second, and third associated pulses stand to
one another almost exactly in the ratio 3:2:1. It is easily seen in fact in fig. 2
that the summits of corresponding first, second, and third associated pulses lie nearly
on straight lines, which, if produced, would cut the zero line at points answering
roughly to days +110, This linearity in the summits cannot well represent the true
phenomenon exactly, because it would imply that no finite associated pulse existed
except those shown in fig. 2, whereas there can be but little doubt that if data existed
for a really long series of years, pulses could be recognised considerably beyond the

range of the figure. At first sight, one might have expected to find the maximum
ordinates in successive pulses decreasing after an exponential law. But two things
have to be remembered.
