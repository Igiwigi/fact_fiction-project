Thus we have
a double auricle in Chiton and Haliotis, and a close approach to it in Tethys, Janus,
and the Folide. In the Cephalopoda the contraction of the branchio-cardiac veins has been
observed by Mitxe-Epwarps and KGrukKeR, 80 that they may be considered to be
auricles. This is another curious illustration of the fact, that what is commonly
considered the most concentrated and highest organization does not occur in the
reputed highest forms of Mollusca. The heart lies above the intestine, and gives off the aorta anteriorly. This
runs forwards through the cephalo-pedal ring with the cesophagus, and terminates
eventually in the buccal mass.
