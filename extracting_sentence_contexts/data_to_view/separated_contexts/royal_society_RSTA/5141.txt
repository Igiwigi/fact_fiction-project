Echoing Hale’s concerns about counter-factual falsifiability, Preston [20] has : <
argued that the empirical nature of the moral hazard argument prevents a meaningful assessment : s

being made, because the impact of geoengineering on existing climate policies would only be
knowable when (or if) the situation actually unfolded. However, while it may not be possible
to know with certainty how the prospect of geoengineering will impact on public attitudes and
behaviour, it is possible to explore this question with members of the public now.

(b) The moral hazard argument and public perceptions

There is only very limited empirical evidence with which to begin to evaluate the perceived

risk of a geoengineering moral hazard among the general public. One quantitative study, using : 2
a representative sample of US, UK and Canadian opinion and focusing specifically on SRM : S
technologies, found that people were more likely to disagree than agree with the statement ‘Solar a
radiation management should be used so we can continue to use oil, coal and natural gas’ [25]. [4
In initial focus groups with a small sample of the UK public conducted for the 2009 Royal Society : x
report [1], no support was found for the idea that geoengineering would generate a moral hazard. : =
In fact, the data pointed to a possible ‘galvanizing’ effect of geoengineering: although participants : s

were generally cautious or hostile towards geoengineering proposals, several stated that they
would actually be more motivated to undertake mitigation actions themselves (such as reducing
energy consumption) if they saw government and industry investing in geoengineering research
or deployment. This unexpected response seemed to be most pronounced among participants
with more sceptical views on climate change. The question of whether geoengineering might ‘galvanize’ sceptical public opinion is an
intriguing one.
