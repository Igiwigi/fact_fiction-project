Measuring costs precisely might be more difficult if they
are often manifested at the physiological level. There is a
rich literature on the effects of early environmental effects
on physiological measures of condition, including telomere
lengths, the efficiency of insulin pathways, organ capacity
and metabolism [94-98], but so far none of these have been
analysed with respect to cooperative investment [23]. Never-
