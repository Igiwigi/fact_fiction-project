Elsewhere during the months of September, October, and
November, 4 adults and 135 immature animals were trapped and 1 adult was picked
up dead. Thus a great preponderance of immature animals were trapped during
these months both in Hertfordshire and elsewhere. The fact that of approximately
35 animals caught in barley and clover stubbles 25 were adults clearly indicates that
for some obscure reason this method of obtaining material favoured the taking of
adults as compared with trapping. The numbers of each sex obtained each month are given in Table II. The upper
part of the table contains animals taken in the year in which they were born, the
lower part animals in their second year.
