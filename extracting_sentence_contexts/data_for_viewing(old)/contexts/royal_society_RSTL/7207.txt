the Baltic, that I was able to determine the quantity of salt near the surface and in the
depth, but it is very probable that similar differences also may occur in other large
inlets of the ocean. I want, however, direct observations in sufficient number, and
Shall here only mention an obseryation from the Caribbean Sea, where surface-water
contained 19:936 chlorine, and water from a depth of 1170 feet contained 19:823 per
1000 chlorine. This difference in which the deeper water is less saline may be another
instance of the effect of hot winds, like the water from the Mediterranean between
Africa and the Island of Candia.

Going on now to the main section of the ocean, we will begin with the Atlantic,
about which we have the best information, and which seems to show the most interesting
facts. I will state the results of my investigations in moving from Baffin's Bay towards
the south, In Baffin's Bay itself the water of the surface contains the same quantity of
salt as that of the depth, but as s0on as we pass the southernmost point of Greenland, the
water of the surface contains more alt than that from the depth. 'This difference
increases in going towards the Equator, and is indeed very considerable near that line.
About the Equator, and a little to the south of it, many irregularities appear, as, for
instance, in one case where the strongest water was found between two weaker portions
above and below. In other cases the quantity of salt decreased with the depth, and in
some instances it increased with it. I shall now state the observations themselves,
Dr. Rixx sent me water from the surface in Baffin's Bay to the west of Disco Island, which
contained 33-594 per 1000 salt, and at the same place from a depth of 420 feet, which
contained 53:607. The difference is 80 small that it signifies nothing. At the southern-
most point of Greenland a small difference is observed, viz. in 599 45' N. lat. and 399 4
