experimental techniques cannot provide data at all, or at an insufficient spatio-
temporal resolution. In turn, experiments remain as the key to corroborate or
disprove conclusions drawn from computer simulations. Thus, iteration between
experimental work and computer simulations is required to arrive at a
sufficiently complete picture. The advantages of modelling lie in the fact that
virtual experimentation allows the observation of all quantities of interest at
almost any desired spatio-temporal resolution, simultaneously or consecutively,
over the entire domain of interest. For instance, with mapping techniques,
a trade-off has to be made regarding the choice of spatio-temporal resolution
and observation domain, where signals are recorded either from a small domain
such as a small patch at a cardiac surface at a fairly high spatio-temporal
resolution, or from a larger domain at a lower spatio-temporal resolution
(Sharifov et al. 2004). Furthermore, although optical mapping sensors pick up
signals from the tissue depth as well, they are mainly constrained to the
observation of electrical activity occurring close to the cardiac surfaces. Efforts
are underway to overcome these limitations by using optrodes (Byars et al.
2003; Caldwell et al. 2005; Kong et al. 2007) or inverse recovery techniques
