Each rootlet is invariably placed exactly opposite one of the protoxylem-groups
of the main root which bears it (see photograph 12, fig. 20, and the figures above
cited). This fact is shown with special beauty in the longitudinal section repre-
sented in photograph 15. Here one of the rootlets is cut exactly in the median
plane, and its connection with the smallest peripheral xylem-elements of the main
root is clear. The tracheides of the rootlet bend at a right angle on joining those of
the main root.
