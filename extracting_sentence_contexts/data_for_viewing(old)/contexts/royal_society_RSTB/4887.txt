In sections 2 to 5, Table XV, a series of comparisons is given on the first method.
In each section of the table two cases are taken, in the first of which the destruction
of species is cataclysmic, in the second continuous and of such severity as to give the
same total of species killed-out; the severity of the destruction is raised from each
section of the table to the next. I need hardly say that no importance is to be attached
to the precise number of cataclysms taken and the (very large) proportion of the then-
existing species killed-out by each: the scheme is simply so arranged as to illustrate
the effect of very different time-incidences of destruction.

Of the four columns on the right of Table XV, the first gives the number of species
killed-out. The second shows a chance that I have termed for brevity in the heading
the chance of a species surviving for 10 million years : it is, in fact, the tenth-root of the
chance of a species surviving for the whole period of 100 million years, which we have
assumed is the time elapsed since the genesis of the flowering plants. If p is the chance
of surviving 10 million years, p’ is the chance of surviving 20 million years under the same
conditions, 7° the chance of surviving 30 million years, and so on: since p'° in several
of the examples is vanishingly small, it is more convenient to give p. The third column
gives the doubling-period, and the fourth the present rate of production of specific
mutations. By increasing the destruction of species (section 5) to such an extent that
over 700,000 must have been killed-out, which would require if there had been 100
equally destructive cataclysms that each should have killed-out no less than one-third
of the then-existing species, the estimated length of the doubling-period has been lowered
to a little over one million years, and the estimated rate of production of specific mutations
raised to 1 in some 10 or 12 years: it makes no practical difference whether the killing-
