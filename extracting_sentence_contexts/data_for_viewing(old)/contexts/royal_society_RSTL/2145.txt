in the intensity of a magnetised needle from changes of tem-
perature, as deducible from the times of its vibration. I have
before stated in my paper on. the effects of temperature on the
intensity of magnetic forces, that, in deducing the terrestrial
magnetic intensity by means of the vibrations of a needle, a
correction ought to be introduced where the observations
have been made at different temperatures. [I had not at the
time made any experiments by which I could ascertain how
far changes in the temperature of a needle would be sensible
in the time of its vibration ; and the first observations which
I made with this view being with a light needle, did not give
very decided results: they however led me first to notice the
very singular fact, that a magnetic needle comes to rest
more quickly when vibrated exposed to the rays of the sun,
than when vibrated in the shade.

In order to ascertain the effect which changes of tempera-
ture have on the times of vibration of a needle, it is neces-
sary to know the temperature of the needle itself during the
observations, and I saw no better means of ascertaining this,
even approximately, than to vibrate it in the shade and then
exposed to the rays of the sun, and to consider the tempera-
