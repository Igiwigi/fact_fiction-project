Sthe assignment, as far as could safely be done, of the approximate values of each of the
Sthree elements at the intersections of every fifth degree of latitude between — 40® and
<—90?, and of every 10th degree of longitude from 0* to 360?, thus supplying the nume-
erical coefficients which may be required, in whole or in part, in a revision of Gavss's

S We learn from the original publication of that important work, in the © Resultate aus

notions, 1840, that the numerical data employed in the calculations were for
Q« twelve meridional points on each of seven parallels of latitude ”—the greater part of
the parallels being taken north of the equator, and none s8outh of —20*. To those who
duly considered the possible influence of this incompleteness of the numerical coefficients,
it will not have been matter of surprise that where these were wanting the result of the
calculations should have been found to differ widely from the facts made known by

* No record appears to have been made of the amount of the ship's © heeling ” at the times of observation ;
in reference to this Mr. Axcnrbatp Sarre remarks in a note to myself, that in the * Erebus,” on North and
South courses, when the effect produced is a maximum, it would only be 30" tan 6 for every degree of heel ;
