proper character, and as iron or nickel would do in the place of the lead, then the
force there would be ---- 21, whereas it is less, or according to the as8umed
numbers only £- 10. Now as there is no reason why the lead should have any
superiority assigned to it over the solution, since the latter can give a balanced con-
dition amongst good conductors in its proper Situation as well as the former ; how
can this be, unless lead possess that strange character of sometimes giving equipoised
contacts, and at other times not (1865.).

1892. If that be true of lead, it must be true of all the metals which, with this sul-
phuretted electrolyte, give circles producing currents; and this would include bismuth,
copper, antimony, silyer, cadmium, zinc, tin, &c. &. With other electrolytic fluids
iron and nickel would be included, and even gold, platinum, palladium ; in fact all the
bodies that can be made to yield in any way active voltaic circuits. Then is it pos

-8ible that this can be true, and yet not a single combination of this extensive class of
bodies be producible that can give the current without chemical action (1867.), con-
sidered not as a result, but as a known and pre-existing force ?

1893. I will endeayour to avoid further statement of the arguments, but think my-
self bound to produce (1799.) a small proportion of the enormous body of facts which
appear to me to bear evidence all in one direction.

1894. Bismuth—This metal when associated with platinum, gold, or palladium in
Solution of the sulphuret of potassium, gives active circles, the hismuth being positive.
