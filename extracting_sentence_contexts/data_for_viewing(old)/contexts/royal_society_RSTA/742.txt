where, according to the theory, a=1/3 for an optimum rotor. In [13], they employ as a typical
value a= 1/4. Furthermore, they employ two different versions of (2.7): one in which the body
force is taken as a constant over the rotor disc and one in which the body force varies according
to the local axial velocity. The latter is evidently more correct, as local turbulence properties and
wind shear will change the value of the body force both in time and space. In [50], the body
force is obtained directly from a blade-element approach whereby the problem of determining the
reference velocity is avoided. This however demands detailed knowledge of the rotor geometry
and its control system. The latter was obtained directly from SCADA data by [50]. However, in


the planning phase of a wind farm, there is usually little technical information about the wind
turbines to be used. In this case, the best approach may be to exploit the fact that most modern
wind turbines are tip-speed regulated to rated wind speed after which they are power regulated.
For wind speeds less than rated, (2.8) may be employed with a taken as optimal. At wind speeds
above rated, the average power coefficient is given by
