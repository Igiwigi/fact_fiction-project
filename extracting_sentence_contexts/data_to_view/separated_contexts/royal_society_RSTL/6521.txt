The limiting
case is that of perfect fluidity, in which both the forces of original displacement and
those of restitution are indefinitely small. In these latter cases the tangential cohesion
is necessarily 8mall, and such also (as bodies are usually constituted) will be the normal
cohesion. At the same time the power of resisting compression of yolume may be very
great, as in fact it is in nearly all masses not technically designated as elastic masses. In other words, the normal elasticity, with reference to pressure, may be of any magni-
tude, while the tangential elasticity equals zero. It will be observed that T have here spoken of a body as held in a state of constraint
by external forces, but without any kind of dislocation which should destroy its conti-
nuity or injure its 8tructure.
