Tt is not 8oluble in pure alcohol or ether. In alkaline liquids it
immediately dissolves, forming solutions which show a bluer tint than the original pig-
ment. In fact turacin is a very delicate test for the alkalies. For example, perfectly
pure barium hydrate in slution does not dissolve turacin ; but let a minute trace of s0da
exist, as it often does, in the baryta-s0lution, and then the liquid will become readily
tinted if shaken up with a fragment of turacin. Very strong solutions of the caustic
alkalies dissolve the pigment, but at the same time it suffers a partial decomposition,
evidenced by an odour resembling that of certain bases of the pyridine series, which it
then evolyes.
