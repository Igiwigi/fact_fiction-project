For example, with a current of feeble power the carbons of the electric lamp may be
warmed and caused to emit invisible rays. But, the intensity of these same rays may
be augmented a thousandfold by raising the carbons to the temperature necessary for
the electric light. Here, in fact, the luminous and non-luminous emission augment
together, the maximum of brightness of the visible rays occuring simultaneously with
the maximum calorific Power of the invisible ones+. At frequent intervals during the
riment on the invisible rays of the
Ject of special investigation,

past ten or twelve years I have had occasion to expe-

The present, paper contains a brief account of the inquiry. I endeayour, in the first place, to compare the luminous with the non-luminous radia-
tion of the electric light, and to determine their relative energy ; I point out a method
of detaching the luminous from the non-luminous rays; and afterwards describe various

experiments illustrative of the calorific power of the invisible rays, and of the transmu-
tations of which they are capable.
