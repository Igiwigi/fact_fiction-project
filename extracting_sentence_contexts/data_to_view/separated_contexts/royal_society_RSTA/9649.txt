This is called
the Sharp series—or (by Kayser and Runeer) the 2nd associated series. The third
series is called the Diffuse—or the 1st associated series. It has in fact a negative
kind of criterion. The preceding definitions apply to the three series in all elements,
including such elements as Li, He, and others which show singlet series. When
doublets and triplets appear, we have a simple physical criterion for the Principal
+ Series in that it is that series in which the doublets or triplets converge with increasing
S order.
