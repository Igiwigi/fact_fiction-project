The opalescence
too was doubtless owing to a minute trace of solid matter. This, however, is per-
fectly clear, that the two salts, though they have mutually decomposed each other,
have not done $0 in the atomic proportions ; not according to the schemes

Pt CI, +2KI=Pt I, +2KCl
and Pt CL, +3KI=PtI,, KI+2KCI. It has required, in fact, about four equivalents of iodide of potassium to produce the
maximum amount of the platinic iodide; and the latter terms of the series exhibit a
stil] increasing amount of the intensely red double iodide of platinum and potassium. It may be expected that the double chloride is one of the salts produced in such a
mixture*, Successive additions of a strong solution of chloride of potassium to a
mixture of one equivalent of bichloride of platinum with two of iodide of potassinm,
were found to reduce the colour greatly, making it browner.
