J. C. MALET ON A CLASS OF INVARIANTS. 763
and therefore we have for the complete solution

a

yY=—ar {A$(z)+By(z)+Cx(z)+D}

It
$(x)=e®, p(@)=e", x(@)=e"*,

Q;, Qz, Q, are constants determined from the equations previously given ; in fact we
easily find
40,=—=(z+8+y), 6Q=a8+ay+8y, 4Q,=—aþy

H, G, and I are constants, and the solution is

In addition to the class of invariants of Linear Differential Equations which I have
diseussed in the first part of this paper, there is also another class worth noticing,
namely, functions of the coefficients of the equation which remain unaltered when the
independent variable is changed. TI propose now to consider these functions. The quadratic.
