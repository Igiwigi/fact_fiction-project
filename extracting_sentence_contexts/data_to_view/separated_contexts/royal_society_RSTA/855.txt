The non-deviating region is one in which
propagation can be considered rectilinear but in which absorption may not be negligible. In this region there is no appreciable variation with height in the angle between the
direction of propagation of the wave and the direction of the earth’s magnetic field, and
consequently the main difficulty which the technique of the present paper was developed
to overcome is non-existent. The attenuation suffered by a magneto-ionic component
in the non-deviating region of the ionosphere may be calculated by integrating
the imaginary part of Appleton’s complex refractive index along the oblique rectilinear
path of the component in the non-deviating region, and this is true in spite of the fact
that the planes of constant amplitude do not coincide with the planes of constant
phase. In the deviating region of the ionosphere the following method is available for
calculating the integrand of (25). Reflexion from the ionosphere is only appreciable
provided the effect of damping in the deviating region is sufficiently small (see p. 429).
