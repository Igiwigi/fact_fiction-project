From my observations
on this body, I think I shall be able to demonstrate satisfac-
torily, that the phenomena of the apophyllite depend on a
principle distinct from that which produces the chief part
of the deviation of tints in most crystals with two axes. The course I propose to pursue is, first, to describe the
phenomena themselves. I shall then show how these phe-
nomena, complicated as they are in appearance, are all redu-
cible to one very simple and general fact; viz, that the axes

50 Mr. J. F. W. HERSCHEL on the action of

of double refraction differ in their position in the same crystal
for the differently coloured rays of the spectrum, being dis-
persed in one plane over an angle more or less considerable,
according to the nature of the substance. In many bodies,
the magnitude of this dispersion of the axes is compara-
tively trifling, while in some, not otherwise remarkable for
a high ordinary or extraordinary dispersive power, it is
enormous, and must render all computation of the tints in
which it is not taken into consideration, completely erroneous;
and indeed obliterating almost every trace of the Newtonian
scale of colour. We have here, then, a new element, which
for the future must enter into all formulz of double refraction
pretending to rigour, and at the same time are presented with
another very striking instance of the inherent distinction be-
tween the differently coloured molecules of light, which, since
the time of NEwrTon, every new step in optical science has
tended to place in a stronger point of view.
