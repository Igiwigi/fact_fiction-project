the direction of the entering light, and position of the observer's eyes, can be traced
along the vessels.

2. Fundus oculi (left eye) of a Nubian youth, wt. 17. The fundus is of a chocolate
colour, and the reflexes are very pronounced, extending over the whole central area.
The translucent nerve fibres can also be traced for a much greater distance beyond
the disc. The macula is cireular and well defined, and surrounded by a brilliant
reflex ring. The choroidal vessels are quite invisible.

PLATE 2.

1. Fundus oculi (left eye) of a Chimpanzee. The resemblance between this
drawing and that of the Nubian youth is most striking. Beyond the facts that there
is less differentiation of colour between the retinal arteries and veins, and that the
vessels branch out somewhat straighter, no differences can be detected.

2. Fundus oculi (left eye) of the White-handed Gibbon. The nerve-fibre layer
and reflexes are prominent. The macula area is very small. The brown choroidal
stroma covered with black dots can be seen outside the central area, where it is
obscured by the reflexes. On all sides bifurcating choroidal vessels radiate from
the vicinity of the disc, and can be traced to the periphery of the field.

1. Fundus oculi (left eye) of a Macaque. The background is without dots, and the
