This gives a great advantage in point of compactness, and the ease with
which mistakes may be discovered and rectified. Where it is advisable, from the

magnitude of the volume correction, to go to a third approximation, this may be
taken as

6,

& is at once given by the slide-rule and added to 5, so that this involves very little
extra trouble. But .the greatest advantage of this method of reduction. is that it avoids the

accumulation of superfluous and meaningless figures, and thereby escapes that fictitious —
accuracy which is so seductive and treacherous in all physical investigations. MEASUREMENT OF TEMPERATURE. 179

Corrections to be applied to the Air Thermometer. Air does not follow exactly the equation of elasticity of a perfect gas pv/@ = mk.
| Since, however, it follows this law very approximately, its true equation of elasticity
may be written

= mk(1—4),

where ¢ is an unknown function of the variables which must be very small.
