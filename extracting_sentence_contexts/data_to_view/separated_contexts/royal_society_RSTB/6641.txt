On the other hand, his correlation with the Adigrat Sandstone (Blanford
1870) of Abyssinia, said to be of Triassic age (Aubry 1886), cannot stand, for the ex-
posure of the Turkana Grits in the Lokitaung Gorge has, since his visit, yielded massive
fossil trees that have proved to be dicotyledonous types.* It would therefore appear
that the grits are not earlier than Cretaceous. A further argument against the sug-
gestion that these grits are of Triassic, or even Cretaceous, age is found in the fact that
they are composed entirely of material derived from the Basement Complex. If the
grits were formed before the fracture that gave rise to the Uganda escarpment, where
are the deposits which must have accumulated as the result of erosion of that escarp-
ment? There is in fact only one sedimentary series, the Turkana Grits, and I am
therefore forced to the conclusion that they are the product of erosion acting on the
Uganda escarpment.
