ML algorithms are like empirics to a certain extent,
but complemented with means of understanding (interpreting) their decision process may lead
to scientific knowledge. In our opinion, we do not believe that the current state-of-the-art ML algorithms might
significantly outperform the human capability of detecting cardiac abnormalities. In fact, the
number of possible confounding factors, co-morbidities, number of rare conditions and evolution
in time of the diseases may all increase the amount of data necessary for ML models to be
trained. In order to mitigate such issues, the creation of innovative ML algorithms, capable of
incorporating the domain knowledge, would facilitate the development of these models (e.g.
less data-hungry algorithms, faster training, larger interpretability) and the introduction of such
methodologies in the clinical practice, thus fostering trust in their use.

a) Limitations of the study

The frameworks presented some limitations. First, rhythm-based cardiac abnormalities were
not properly handled by our methodology.
