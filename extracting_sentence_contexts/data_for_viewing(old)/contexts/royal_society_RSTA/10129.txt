existent in moist climates, or where foliage is luxuriant. The conditions at Kew—
a station situated in an extensive grass-covered park—are hardly such as Exner
associates with a large 12-hour wave. It is possible, of course, that the large
extension of London since 1864 may have profoundly altered the electrical conditions
even as far west as Kew; but if so, one would expect an enormous difference to
manifest itself when the direction of the wind changes from east to west. I am not
prepared to say that such a change of direction is wholly without effect—as it is
difficult to distinguish between the direct effect of change of wind direction and the
indirect effect of the change of weather conditions accompanying it—but if it exists it
is by no means conspicuous. Also the difference between the earlier and later Kew
data is not an increase in the 12-hour wave, but a diminution in the 24-hour wave.
Faulty conditions or local peculiarities seem @ priort more likely to introduce or
enhance fictitious waves than to wipe out real periodic terms, The observed 24-hour
wave, it must be remembered, shows a phase angle which varies largely with the
season of the year, but the differences between the phase angles observed in 1862-4
and 1898-1904 are in most months comparatively small. If, then, the reduction in the
amplitude apparent in the later series is due to some disturbing cause, that cause
must have itself a phase which nearly keeps step with that of the real 24-hour
potential wave throughout the year.

Before attaching much importance to views which after all are mainly theoretical,
it should be remembered that the older Kew data refer to all days, the later only to
fair weather conditions. Future investigations may show the 24-hour term to be
more dependent on the meteorological conditions than the 12-hour term, /Also in
considering the relative importance of the two terms we should make allowance for
