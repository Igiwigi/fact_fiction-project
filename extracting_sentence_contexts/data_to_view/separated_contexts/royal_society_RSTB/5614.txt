This species was first adequately described by WEHMER in “ Beitriige zur Kenntnis
einheimischer Pilze,” Heft 2: ‘‘ Untersuchungen iiber die Fiiulnis der Friichte,” Jena,
1895. Later, THom (1910), in “ Cultural Studies of Species of Penicillium,” p. 31,
renamed this species on the grounds of priority, P. digitatum Saccarpo. Physiologically it is distinguished from almost all other species of Penicillium by
the fact that while it grows readily on organic media, it either refuses to grow or grows
with difficulty on synthetic media containing nitrogen as sodium nitrate (Tom, p. 32). In the course of work described in Part IV of this series on the carbon balance sheets
of species of Penicillium, it was found that three strains of P. digitatum give unusually
large amounts of carbon as “ Carbon in H,SQ,.” The strains used were the following :—
