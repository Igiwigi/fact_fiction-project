In this case, both the applied forces and the maximum crest elevation must include the effects of
the scattered waves. At the boundary between these regimes (drag-inertia and linear diffraction),
defined by low KC numbers, the inertia loading and (weak) wave scattering correspond to the
long wavelength limit of linear diffraction. Unfortunately, this simplistic view does not take into account the fact that the incident waves
may be nonlinear, perhaps highly nonlinear, and that diffraction will be more complicated than
that implied by a simple linear solution. Indeed, the purpose of this study was to examine whether
there exists some intermediate flow regime in which little linear diffraction occurs but, with steep
incident waves, alternative mechanisms lead to the unexpected scattering of nonlinear or high-
frequency waves. Within such a regime, it is possible that the formal perturbation expansions,
on which diffraction solutions typically rely, are unable to resolve the underlying physics.
