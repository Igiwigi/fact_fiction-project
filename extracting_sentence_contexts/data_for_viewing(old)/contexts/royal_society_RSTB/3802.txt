after the ordinary adult pitting has been established. The sections were not, however,
sufficiently radial for me to follow the sequence of changes.

b. The Torus.

In the Gymnosperms the mode of development of the bordered pit and the presence
or absence of a limiting membrane in it were questions to which much attention was
given by anatomists in the last half of the past century. Sanzo (1873),f to whom we
owe the discovery of the “torus” in Pinus, and the final demonstration of the closed
pit in this form, a condition which he thought characterised the whole of the
Gymnosperms, has briefly summarised the work of previous investigators (pp. 92-96).
His masterly demonstration and statement of the case have, no doubt, been
responsible for the fact that until recently all the Gymnosperms have been con-
sidered as conforming to this type. In 1907, however, GwyNNE-VAUGHAN, at the
Leicester meeting of the British Association, opened the controversy again by his
conclusion that there is no limiting membrane in the pitting of certain ferns. In
his published account (1908) he states his inability to discover a pit-closing membrane
either in the Cycad or the Araucarian material he had at his disposal. Before
reading the article by Prof. GwynnE-VauGHAN, but instigated by his work, which
I thought applied only to the ferns, I examined material of the Cycads in connection
with my work on the Araucarians, and came to the same conclusion as he (fig. 39,
Plate 4), my independent work thus confirming his opinion in the case of the Cycads.t

Mr. BalLey’s article was written.
