This effect was also seen to
reduce the concentrations of Cu [43] and Pb [44] in the plume samples compared with those
immediately above or below in the water column. A small lowering of the Si isotope signal
was also seen but no Si concentration anomaly was visible [45]. The fact that enriched chemical
signals were also observed to the west of the MAR is consistent with the general features of
material transport described by Thurnherr et al. [46], namely inflow from the eastern flank of the
Ridge coupled with enhanced diapycnal mixing above the hydrothermal plumes, whose impact
is carried westward by beta-plume dynamics [47]. Strikingly, the 7He : Fe ratio at TAG [39] differs
substantially from that observed from the faster spreading East Pacific Rise (EPR) [24], and is more
similar to that observed in the South Atlantic [19]. While the Al: Fe ratio in the TAG plume (0.73-
1.15) is similar to the EPR plume (approx. 1) the Mn: Fe ratio is much lower at TAG (0.5-0.54)
than in the dispersing EPR plume (1.45).
