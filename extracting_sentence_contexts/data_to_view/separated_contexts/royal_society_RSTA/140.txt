Reinert, have shown that when a fraction p of the nodes of a scale-free graph
is sampled, the observed degree distribution is not that of a scale-free graph. This
was achieved by computing the exact probability generating function (PGF), and
then expanding it in the powers of the parameter p, thus obtaining an approxi-
mate formula. In fact, an exact formula involving finite sums of polylogarithms
is possible. The setting is this: we fix a parameter y> 1, and suppose that we have an
infinite graph in which the fraction of nodes with degree k is k~Y/(y). We now
fix a parameter p, 0<p<1, choose uniformly from the graph a fraction p of the
nodes and keep the edges between these; that is, we form the induced subgraph.
