They found that, for fixed EIS, positive SST anomalies are associated with negative cloud cover
anomalies, consistent with the thermodynamic mechanism. They also found that, in GCMs, the
regression of simulated interannual variability of low cloud on EIS and SST in the stratocumulus : =
regions was consistent with their simulated low cloud response to twenty-first-century climate 3
change, in which there are small increases in EIS and large increases in SST. That is, their 12
observational analysis suggests that low cloud will decrease as SST warms, consistent with the ane
thermodynamic mechanism, and in fact the implied positive cloud feedback is at the upper end :

Dufresne [30] compared interannual cloud variability over the low-latitude oceans in GCMs with [sz
more versus less positive global cloud feedbacks. They used vertical velocity binning [7] to isolate [8
the thermodynamic cloud response of GCMs to tropics-wide temperature.
