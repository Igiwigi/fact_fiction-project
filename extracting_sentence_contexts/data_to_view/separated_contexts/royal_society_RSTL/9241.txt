The line H in 8wch
© ars as Vega must, be ascribed, chiefly at least, to hydrogen, To what extent in cooler stars this line
© ay be due als to calcium we do not know, —March 10, 1880.]
© [Mezsrs. Dewar and Liyzixc state that the calcium line K is more easily reversed than the calcium line
© H (Proceedings Royal Society, February 20, 1879). This fact should be considered in connexion
'* ith the presence of a line of bydrogen at H in any explanation that may be attempted of the phenomena
-— *e8ented in the stars.—March 30, 1880.]
* Professors Dewar and Livzno have permitted me to witness some of their experiments in which

8 ns changes of relative intensity of K to H occur in the emis8ion spectrum of calcium. They are
opinion that these variations and similar changes in the absorption spectrum, such as those shown in
Stars, naturally follow from the known laws of emission and absorption. They state that the line of

m K is more easily reversed than the line at the position of H.
