no laryngoscopic examination had been made, and again in others either no autopsy
had taken place, or the descriptions of the latter, when made, are defective with
regard to the condition of the medulla oblongata, the peripheral parts of the laryngeal
nerves, the microscopic examination of the medulla, the nerve fibres, and the muscles
themselves, &c.

Tn 1884 Bryson Detavan* called attention to the possibility which existed in his
opinion, viz., of localising from clinical observation the cortical motor centre for the
larynx. Of the two cases, however, upon which he based his views, in one (SEGurN’s)
no laryngoscopic examination had been made, whilst he himself frankly stated some
years afterwards,t that in the second one, his own, in which he had attributed the
laryngeal paralysis to a cortical lesion, the post-mortem examination had established
the fact that in reality it was of bulbar nature.

In 1886 Garett recorded an observation, to which he added, in conjunction with
M. Dor, another in 1890, which proved,§ in the opinion of these authors, that
unilateral laryngeal paralysis could be caused by a unilateral lesion of the opposite
hemisphere or internal capsule. We have elsewhere|| taken exception to the interpre-
tation given by these authors to the paralysis observed in their cases, because («) the
medulla oblongata was not microscopically examined at the post-mortem examination,
and (b) the total paralysis (respiratory as wellas phonatory) of the vocal cord observed
in their cases is according to our ablation-experiinents absolutely incompatible with
the idea of its being due to a cerebral lesion.

Recently Rosssacu{ has published a very interesting paper on the subject, in which
