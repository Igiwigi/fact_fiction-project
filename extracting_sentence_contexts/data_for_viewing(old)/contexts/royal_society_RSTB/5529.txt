therefore for regarding the Teilia flora equivalent to the flora of a zone very high up in
the Calciferous Sandstone Series. There are at least nine species of fern-like plants from
Teilia which are also found in beds of the Sumpfenwald Horizon in the Mohra Valley
in Upper Silesia. The marine fauna found associated with the plant remains in the
Teilia beds help to strengthen the comparison. It will be noticed in Table IT that
Posidonomya becheri, which is an abundant fossil in the Teilia beds, is not recorded from
higher beds in Flintshire and North Wales or from above the Blackbyre Limestone in
Scotland (Macergcor, 1929).

It persists in Silesia up as far as the Glockersdorf Horizon. In each of these areas
Posidonomya corrugata appears in beds almost immediately higher in the series.

These facts afford substantial evidence for regarding the Teilia Beds as equivalent to
the upper part of the Oil Shale Group on the one hand, and on the other hand to the
upper part of the Posidonomya becheri Beds in the Mohra Valley. Unfortunately no
identifiable plants have been found in the Holywell Shales in Flintshire, but one would
expect to find a Lower Carboniferous Flora extending upwards into them at least as far
as the horizon characterised by the Goniatite genus Eumorphoceras.

No flora corresponding to the Archaeosigillaria-flora of the Lower Brown Limestone in
the Prestatyn and Denbigh area has been identified in Scotland. Archaeosigillaria
vanuxemt GOrr, has, however, been found in several places near the base of the
