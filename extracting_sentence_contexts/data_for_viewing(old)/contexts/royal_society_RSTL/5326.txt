AND ON THE DIRECT AGENCY OF THE SPERMATOZOON. 235

mixed with a small quantity of water, #wenty;four hours before it was employed. In
the first case, the fluid was obtained when the temperature of the atmosphere was
51* Fanr., and afterwards sunk to 49* Faur., but had again risen to 51* Fans. at the
time of the experiment. When examined with the microscope, immediately before it
was used, the fluid still contained a quantity of very active vibratile spermatozoa, and
also an abundance of spermatozoal cells, still in course of development. This fact
seemed to afford an explanation of the cause of the efficiency of the fluid for 80 great
a length of time, spermatozoa being liberated from the cells during the whole period.
Thus the fact of the prolonged fecundity of this fluid seems to confirm, instead of
oppose the conclusion arrived at,â€”that, the more mature the fluid is before its
removal from the body, the more efficacious it is, but only for a given extent of time,
Since it is then composed almost entirely of very active spermatozoa, with but very
few cells of development. SPaLLaNzax1i, as formerly mentioned, found that the fluid
of the feetid terrestrial Toad (Bufo calamita?) at a high temperature of the season,
70* Fans. to 73* Fanr., at which this species spawns in Italy, had lost its fecundatory
influence at the end of six hours; but that in the temperature of an ice-house,
40* Faux. it retained its efficacy for twenty-five hoursF. Further, that when the fluid
2 was preserved in the testes of the dead animal, at the temperature of the season
mentioned, it became effete in nine or ten hours; but that it continued to be effica-
cious, when retained in those organs in the temperature of an ice-house for thirty-
four hours. Again, he found that the fluid of the green aquatic Frog (Zana esculenta),
