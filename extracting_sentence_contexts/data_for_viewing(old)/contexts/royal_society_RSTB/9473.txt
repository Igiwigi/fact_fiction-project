tation of forensic evidence has to be effective and accurate.
However, beyond that there are many other factors at play.
For example, the confidence with which the forensic expert
delivers their presentation clearly can affect what weight is
given to the testimony [15,16], which means that it is not
only what they say, but how they say it that must be con-
sidered. Whether they use statistics, decision scales or
categorical determinations, the presentation delivery plays an
important role in what is conveyed by the forensic examiners,


or more accurately, what is actually heard and understood by
the trier of fact. Cognitive neuroscience has a large literature
on these affects, which needs to be used when considering face

standards for presentation of forensic evidence in the court. evidence

The adversarial legal system in my opinion presents great
challenges for the proper communication of forensic science
results. Although an expert scientist is in theory impartial
and committed to the truth (indeed, Rule 33.2(1)(a) of The organizational reference
Criminal Procedures clearly and explicitly states that the eum) eallsecel materials
expert’s duty is to the court and to being ‘objective and ——
unbiased’), in practice, the exact opposite is nurtured by the
very nature of the adversarial system.
