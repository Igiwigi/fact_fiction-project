On
reducing to the notation of the present memoir the formula 95 for the representation of
the quintic in terms of the coyariants «, [3, which should give for (a, b, c, d, e, f) the
values obtained ante, No. 312, I find a somewhat different system of values ; viz. these
are

362m ag SE 36d= 36e= 35f=

AB + 1|*AT — 1| AB + 1|*AT — 1| A'B + 1 | *AT —=1
| AC + 1| ABI—3| AC + 1| ABI = 3 | AC +41] ABI -3
| AB* + 6|*ACI +24 | A'B* + 6|*CI +12] AB? +6

ABC — 39 ABC — 27 ABC —15
BLESS AIBZ «+9 AB -e9
AC? — 54 AC? — 42 AC? —30
ABC — 126 *AB*C — 90 *B*C —54
ABC? + 288 BC? +144

CG +1152

where I have distinguished with an asterisk the terms which have different coefficients
in the two formulee. TI cannot at present, explain this discrepancy,
