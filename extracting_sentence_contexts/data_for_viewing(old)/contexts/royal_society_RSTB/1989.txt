OF SPORANGIA UPON FERN PROTHALLI. 227

of the flattened form, the further growth and change in form and structure of
unfertilised prothalli, the production of sporangia, the acquisition of roots by the
fleshy cylindrical process, and lastly the direct continuation of such a process into
a normal stem bearing leaves, were all found in Scolopendrium vulgare. The associa-
tion of the two forms, i.¢., the growth of a prothallus, capable of assuming the
cylindrical form and producing sporangia, from the zygote, has never been seen, and
it would be, perhaps, too much to expect that further experiments may produce it.
It cannot be too strongly insisted upon that the above is put forward merely as a
rovisional hypothesis which serves to connect together a group of facts, the further
Evetady of which must modify, and will possibly disprove it. It may, however, be used
Gas the basis of a comparison with the antithetic theory to ascertain which facts are
2 best explained by the one and which follow most naturally from the other theoretical
E view. This will be done under the following heads :—

” (1.) Alternation in Bryophyta and some Algze.

2 (2.) Normal life-history of Pteridophyta.

< (8.) Abnormal modes of reproduction in Bryophyta and Pteridophyta.

8 (4.) Cytological distinctions between the sexual and asexual generations.

3 (1.) Alternation in Bryophyta and some Alga.
