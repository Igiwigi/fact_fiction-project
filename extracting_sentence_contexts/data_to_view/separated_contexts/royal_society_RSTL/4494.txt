678 MR. FAIRBAIRN'S EXPERIMENTAL INQUIRY And lastly. On the strength and value of wrought-iron frames and ribs as applied
to ships and other vessels*.

PART I.

At the commencement of iron ship-building, in which I took an active part, the
absence of acknowledged facts relative to the strength and varied conditions under
which the material was applied, was the principal reason which induced me to enter
upon this inquiry. I have extended the investigation into the best methods of rivet-
ing, and the proportional strength of rivets, joints, &c., as compared with the plates
and the uses for which they are intended. The latter is a practical and highly im-
portant inquiry, as great difference of opinion exists amongst engineers and others, as
to the form, strength and proportions of rivets, and the joints of which they form an
essential part.
