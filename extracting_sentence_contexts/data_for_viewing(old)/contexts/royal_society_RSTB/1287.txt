The fan-like tracery of the cells, as seen in radial section of the synangium,
that the study of transverse sections will present difficulties ; these are least
youngest stages, such as that shown in fig. 139, which corresponds in age ne
that of fig. 135. The cells shaded are believed to be the archesporia, but I sho
slow to make precise statements on this point, and especially so in face of
culty, above noted, of assigning definite limits to the sporogenous tissue ii
synangia. Further stages of development are shown in figs. 140-142; and
allowance is made for the transverse sections cutting the cell-rows rather ob
(as must be the case in parts with a fan-like tracery), it will be seen that
verse sections fit with all reasonable closeness of comparison with the resi
the longitudinal.

The main facts derived from the study of Psilotwm thus coincide with those

esipteris, as regards the origin of the sporangiophore, and the appearance of
ium on its upper surface, below the extreme apex. The following points
sted as more specially applicable to Psilotum, in addition to those already
ized for Tmesipteris :â€”

s organic apex of the sporangiophore coincides with the groove between the
xm and the pair of abaxial growths (leaf-lobes), as seen in the mature state.
three-sided pyramidal cell is usually present at the apex of the synangium.
