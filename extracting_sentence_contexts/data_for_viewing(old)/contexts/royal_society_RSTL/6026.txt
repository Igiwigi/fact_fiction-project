years of mean lifetime.

1t will be observed that in this Table, instead of 100,000 lines, these lines are thrown
into 106 groups, each comprising the variable number of lines terminating in each of
106 intervals numbered on the line AC, and representing years of age. And in these
short intervals it is assumed that the mean length of the lines terminating in the
eleventh interval (10 to 11) is represented by 104, and s0 on.

The relative numbers of persons living simultaneously at each interval of age will
also be represented in the same Plate, fig. 1, by 106 successive vertical lines, raised
from nearly the centre of each interval between the ordinates on the line AC, and
meagsured in units of which the line AB contains 100,000. The same lines bound the
figure representing the two orders of facts; and the numerical units expressing the
aggregate length of the vertical lines equal in amount the units expressing the aggre-
gate length of the horizontal lines expressed in the horizontal units.

(14.) I will now explain briefly the nature of the column Y,, which I have added to
the Life-Table*. The Life-Table (column P,) exhibits a representative population,
such as would be constituted by separating every year 100,000 births as they occurred,
