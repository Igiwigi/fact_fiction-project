with the same expressions for the comparative. brightness as before. See No. 16,
23. 'The first of the above equations, compared with the Cartesian law of refraction,
regarded as an experimental truth, shows that s is independent of 9; in fact,

and since by the Cartesian law S4p is independent of 9, it follows that s is also inde-

pendent of 8. This quantity must therefore be regarded as a certain coefficient of
absorption, depending mainly on the constitution of the crystal and the period of the
incident ray, possibly also in some degree on the orientation of the ray, or the posi-
tion of the plane in which its vibrations are performed, with regard to certain fixed
planes in the crystal, or refracting medium, whether solid or fluid. Tae theoretical
determination of this coefficient can only result from a more perfect theory of reso-
nance than has hitherto been given, and it is hoped that some of the great modern
analysts will turn their attention in this a ——_
