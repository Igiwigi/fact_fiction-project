will be annually removed from a
hectare of meadow (= 45 to 54 Ibs, per acre), and that as only 10 kilog., or less, of
this will be restored as combined nitrogen in rain, &c., there will be an annual loss of
from 40 to 50 kilog. per hectare (= 36 to 45 lbs, per acre); so that, if there were not
compensation from the free nitrogen of the air, the soil would become gradually
exhausted. Further, he considers that the fact of the fixation of free nitrogen, not
only explains how fertility is maintained, but how argillaceous soils which are sterile
when first brought into contact with the air, gradually yield better crops, and at
length become vegetable moulds. FRANK again, assumes that the average loss of
nitrogen by the removal of crops is 51 kilog. per hectare (= 45 Ibs.
