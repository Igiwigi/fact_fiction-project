will readily be appreciated when it is remembered that the record shown in figure 3 is
taken at a depth of 200 ft., and that at shallower depths effects of the shorter period waves
will predominate. This is confirmed by the fact that the damped pendulum record which is
used to estimate the correction for tilting of the swinging plane of the main pendulums
shows marked oscillations, indicating that the natural period of the gimbal system (approxi-
mately 2-3 sec.) is being excited. When computing the second-order corrections, a factor is
introduced to allow for the effect of resonance of both the gimbal system and long-period
pendulums. This factor is almost independent of frequency for a considerable band in the
region of 8 to 9 sec., but if wave periods widely different from this value are present the
magnification factor estimated from the ‘mean wave period’ will certainly be too small.
An estimate of the magnitude indicates, however, that this error can hardly exceed 10%
even under the most severe conditions encountered. The damping of the long-period
pendulums and the fact that their knife edges are above the axis of the gimbals will also tend
to cause a slight overestimate of the acceleration, but their combined effects cannot exceed
a few per cent. These errors account for part of the observed discrepancy but not all of it.

(2) Vertical accelerations. The fluctuations of the chronometer marks provide a method by
which the vertical accelerations may be estimated. The results obtained are not entirely
satisfactory because the fluctuations could only be measured during the beginning and end-
parts of the record and at those places during the middle part near where a coincidence
with the sidereal chronometer occurred. Thus only three or four samples, each of a few
