On p. 2411 the statement ‘An important conclusion to be drawn from theory (Miller
et al. 1989), which was largely verified, was that the intense lines in the clumps arose
from transitions with small kinetic energy releases’ contains an incorrect reference.
In fact, the prediction that the intense lines in the clumps arose from transitions
with small kinetic energy releases was predicted using semi-classical mechanics by
E. Pollack and co-workers (Gomez Llorente & Pollack 1988; Berblinger et al. 1989).
