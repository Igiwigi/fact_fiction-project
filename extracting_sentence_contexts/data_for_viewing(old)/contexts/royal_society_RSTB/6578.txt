to its function. On morphological grounds it is scarcely possible to justify the term,


AMPHIOXUS (BRANCHIOSTO MA) LANCEOLATUS 307

for the description and figures of FRANz (1927a) suggest that the network of blood
vessels on the diverticulum is essentially similar to that surrounding most of the
intestine, and may merely emphasize the fundamental resemblance between the two
regions.

It seems clear that HAmMaRâ€™s interpretation of the diverticulum derives in part from
the belief that it may be regarded as the liver of the Craniates in a simple form;
Franz (1927a) in fact describes it as resembling that of a very young Petromyzon
embryo. Now as a purely morphological concept this may be reasonable, but on
other grounds, as the present work has shown, it is far from acceptable, for it is difficult
to believe that the specialized secretory epithelium of the diverticulum could have
become transformed into the totally different hepatic tissue of the Craniates. All
experience suggests that the latter organ would be more likely to develop from the
beginning sui generis.

It may be concluded so far, then, that there is as yet no sound support for the
interpretation of the diverticulum as homologous with the Craniate liver, while the
evidence now available tends to cast doubt upon that interpretation. It remains to
enquire whether there is any other Craniate organ to which the diverticulum might
be compared.
