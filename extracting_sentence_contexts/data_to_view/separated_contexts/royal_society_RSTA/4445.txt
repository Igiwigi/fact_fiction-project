Additional advantages of the method reside in (i) its simplicity (we need few parameters:
the pattern length/embedding dimension D and the embedding delay r) and (ii) the extremely
fast nature of the pertinent calculation process [40]. The Bandt and Pompe methodology can be
applied not only to TS representative of low dimensional dynamical systems, but also to any
type of TS (regular, chaotic, noisy or reality based). In fact, the existence of an attractor in the
D-dimensional phase space is not assumed. The only condition for the applicability of the Bandt
and Pompe method is a very weak stationary assumption: for k < D, the probability for x¢ < x;4
should not depend on t. For a review of Bandt and Pompe’s methodology and its applications
to physics, biomedical and econophysics signals, see Zanin et al. [41].
