When about 0-27 gram of any of the alloys containing platinum was added to 100 CC,
of this warm dilute sulphuric acid, the metal was instantly attacked, leaving after
only a few seconds merely a small residue. This behaviour was peculiar to the platinum

alloys ; those containing rhodium or gold, none of which contained platinum, did not
behave in this remarkable manner.

The examination of the alloys containing rhodium presented some interesting features.
Thus, while the metal itself is insoluble in aqua-regia, those of the present alloys which
contained rhodium, in fact all the alloys, as stated above, were easily soluble.

The removal of rhodium from a solution containing free sulphuric acid by means
of hydrogen sulphide needed special treatment. The complete precipitation of the
thodium was only achieved by the addition of ammonia to the sulphuric acid solution
saturated with H,8, until a considerable quantity of ferrous sulphide was preeipitated,
this being just dissolved by the addition of dilute sulphuric acid. On again saturating
with H.S, the whole of the rhodium was precipitated.

The appearance of the noble metals derived from the ignited HS precipitate, after
removal of co-precipitated iron, copper, etc., was characteristic. The platinum was
grey, rhodium greyish-black, and gold earthy brown. On re-ignition the gold assumed
its familiar lustre.
