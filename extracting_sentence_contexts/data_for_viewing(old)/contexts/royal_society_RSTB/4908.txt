assume the law of free increase as simply logarithmic from the beginning, and write A
in (39) as unity. As we have just seen, the only effect of such an assumption in the
above case is to reduce the estimated doubling-period from 6-4 to 5-8 million years.

I will first suppose the killing-out to be practically continuous, though as stated in the
Introduction I do not think this at all closely represents the facts. Let the numbers at
successive small intervals of time be

where p is the proportion of survivors and r gives the free rate of increase. If
p=1—80
r=1+a0
in the limit when the time-interval 6 is made very small we may write
