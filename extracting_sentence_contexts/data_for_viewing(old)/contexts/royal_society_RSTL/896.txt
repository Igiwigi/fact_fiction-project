Thelatitude of Cowhythe, by the Trigonometrical Survey,
is 570.41/.11‚Äù, from which deducting 4,02 for the distance
on the meridian, 1,99 the error of the former latitude of
Greenwich, and 2,92 the arc due to 294, feet, we obtain
579.41'.2',07 for the latitude of my station, deduced from that
of Cowhythe, and differing 4/,68 in excess from the latitude
given by the Repeating Circle.

These observations for connecting my station with Cow-
hythe were made under various unfavourable circumstances,
and indeed I am not quite sure that the object I took on
Knock Hill was in fact the station; for a pole originally
placed in the centre of a cone of masonry, as at Cowhythe,
has been taken away, and it was some time before I could
decide which to choose among two or three eminences re-
sembling each other, which happen to be upon the hill. The
preceding result therefore can be considered only as a proof
that no error of consequence is to be feared in my determi-
nation of the latitude of Portsoy.
