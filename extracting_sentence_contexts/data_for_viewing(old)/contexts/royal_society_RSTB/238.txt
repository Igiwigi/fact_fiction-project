Extension was most marked at 6, then 75, 52, 61, 64, 61’.

Although so seldom moving primarily, it is interesting to note that when this did
occur, the hip was nearly as often extended as flexed; while on the other hand, as
noted above, in the movements of the joint of secondary, tertiary, and quaternary
sequence, extension was extremely rare as compared to flexion,

Marcu or SEQUENCE OF MOVEMENTS IN THE SEGMENTS OF THE Lower Limp.
(See fig. 14, p. 213.)

The sequence of movements successively invading the various segments of the limb,
when any given point in the cortex is excited, varies in mode according to the segment
in which the movement commences. For this reason the facts are best grouped
together according to the seat of the primary movement. Thus we have different
types named after the various segments of the limb. We commence with the most
frequent,

Class L—Hallu« Type, observed at centres 61, 62, 65, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72.

The march of the muscular spasm when commencing with movement of the hallux
is very constant, the order of joints affected being almost invariably :-—

Hallux, Small Toes, Ankle, Hip, and Knee.

In a relatively considerable number of instances the hip and knee moved simul-
