Resin-rich eyelet features and tow
deviation are apparent on the fracture surface.

compared with experimental data across a range of Z-pin array tests at different mode mixities;
double cantilever beam (DCB), end loaded split (ELS) and mixed mode bending (MMB). Success
of such models means that for the first time a capability exists for the design of any composite
structural element with microfastener through-thickness reinforcement, allowing assessment of
the interaction between the microscale bridging behaviour of individual microfasteners and
the global load-carrying capacity of the laminate coming from external boundary conditions. That is not to say the problem is solved without future challenges; in particular, the fact
that microfastener behaviour is strongly dependent on the local conditions of their insertion,
such as laminate thickness, orientation and foundation material, means that significant further
development is still required to achieve a full structural-scale design capability.

5. Modifications of in-plane properties

The reductions in the in-plane strength of the composite, which inevitably accompany the sought
after out-of-plane performance enhancement, will need to be considered carefully in future
designs [24]. Not doing so risks the appearance of unexpected new failure modes in through-
thickness reinforced structures.
