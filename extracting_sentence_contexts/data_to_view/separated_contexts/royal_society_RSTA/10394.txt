We require to evaluate # to the fourth order; now d is at least of the second
order and d? of the fourth order; hence d?. 8? is at least of the fifth order and
negligible. Hence, finally, to the required degree of approximation

E=1JJ—JR+ CR —}3CC + $DD + $(A; — 4,) 80° — 5 Md’o*. . (3). Tt will appear below that d is not even of the second order, so that the last term

will, in fact, entirely disappear, although we cannot see at the present stage that this
will be so.

There will, I think, be no confusion if I also use B in a second sense, defining it by
the equations
