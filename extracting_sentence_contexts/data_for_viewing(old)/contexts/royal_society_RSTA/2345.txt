only by volume fractions and two-point correlations and corresponding estimates of response
cannot possibly be more than approximations. In the case of statics, discussed first, equilibrium
can be defined via minimum principles (of potential energy or complementary energy) and
basically this fact enables at least some precise statements to be made, in the form of upper
and lower bounds on effective properties, subject to the given amount of statistical information.
It is often the case that judgement is still required as to which (if either) bound is the better
approximation, and in practice an approximation lying between the bounds is likely to be
preferred. If only two-point information is available, the procedure almost universally adopted
is to relax the classical energy principles to a form first developed by Hashin & Shtrikman [1], in
which an essential first step is to formulate the problem relative to a homogeneous ‘comparison
medium’. Depending on the choice of this comparison medium, the Hashin-Shtrikman procedure
delivers either an upper or a lower bound, or an approximation in between.

A natural generalization of this approach emerged for dynamics which facilitated, first,
treatment of low-frequency dynamic response, essentially as a perturbation from the static
response, and later, response at any frequency. An alternative way of considering the dynamics
