Curve IV, represents the total radiation from sun and sky on a horizontal plane; i¢., the curve
represents the variation of

\, {cos (E() +H (0)} dd with ¢

The calculations are only given as far as ¢ = 80°. Curves I. and II. fall to zero at ¢ = 90°. Curve IIT.
is arbitrarily carried on beyond this point (in dotted lines) to ¢ = 100°, and represents to some extent the
intensity of scattered radiation due to the “ twilight” following the sunset or preceding the sunrise. The
effect of the earth’s curvature makes it practically impossible to calculate the scattered radiation when the
sun is below the horizon. The heat reaching the earth before sunrise shows itself in continuous air-
temperature records in the fact that the minimum in the diurnal inequality of temperature occurs about
one-half hour before the sun actually rises.

The curve just described are intended for use in meteorological problems.
