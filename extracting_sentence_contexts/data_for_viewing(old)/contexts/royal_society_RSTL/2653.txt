segment. In a former paper I haye particularly described those nerves which, from
their distribution, were considered to be more especially concerned in respiration.
My endeayour now is to trace these and the moto-sensitive nerves to their termina-
tions in the different layers of ventral and lateral muscles.

The inverted position of the nervous cords in insects and other Invertebrata has
not a little confounded the right understanding of the analogy which exists between
the neryous cords of yertebrated and inyertebrated animals, and has given an appear-
ance of probability to the opinion entertained by some anatomists that the cords in
Invertebrata are not analogous to the spinal cord of Vertebrata, but to the sympathetic
system. Eyen some of those who now believe that these cords are really analogous
to the cerebro-spinal system of the higher animals, can hardly reconcile this opinion
with the fact of their being situated along the ventral instead of the dorsal surface of
the body. The reason for this change of poxition of the cords in Invertebrata ap-
pears to be partly to protect the cords themselves, and partly that the nerves may
be supplied to the limbs without having to travel round the sides of the body, and
thereby be exposed to the hazard of injury, which they would be were they situated
along the dorsal surface as in Vertebrata, But notwithstanding this change of
position of the cords in Invyertebrata,—since we now find that they are composed
each of two tracts, as in vertebrated animals,—it is interesting to observe that these
two cords, and the tracts of which they are composed, bear the same relative po-
sition to the viscera and to the exterior of the body as in Man and other Vertebrata.
Thus the cord which runs along the ventral surface in Articulata has its motor
tract nearest to the viscera (a), or most internal, the same as in the human subject ;
while the sensitive tract, which possesses the ganglia, lies along the under surface of
