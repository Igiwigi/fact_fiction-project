=pf* the following memoir. When T entered upon the investigation of which it records the results, T found, in
he writings of various British and ſoreign authors, a copious Calamitean literature ; but the widest discrepancies
evailed amongst them both as to Facts and to inductions. T therefore determined to pursue the 8tudy of this
Sroup of fossils as if de novo, to record the facts which T observed, and to draw from those facts alone 8nch
Anferences as 8emed legitimate, both facts and inferences being in a certain 8ense, and 80 ſur as was possible
r the cireumstances, new and original, But it necessarily follows that 80me of these facts and inferences
gre not absolutely new, though many of them, T think, will be found to be additions to our knowledge of the
—ubject ; whilst others, though not new, have presented themselves to me in a light different to that in which
have been regarded by my able predecessors in the study. Such being the object of the memoir, T have not
effeemed it deirable to include in it a record of all the observations made by preceding writers.
