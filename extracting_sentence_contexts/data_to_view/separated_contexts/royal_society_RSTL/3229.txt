These isthmuses and channels when left by the receding waves, might be called land-
straits, for they would present smooth, flat, narrow surfaces, connecting more open
spaces. During the rise of the land they would at first separate the heads of two ad-
Joining creeks, and afterwards, the upward movements proceeding, they would form
the watersheds between adjoining-and opposite glens. By this means, I explain both
the ordinary structure of the land in these mountains, where the waters divide, as al-
ready described ; and more especially the remarkable fact of the exact coincidence of
several such points with the lines of shelves,â€”the shelves only indicating the long in-
terval of rest in the upward subterranean moyements. It may be remembered that
I deseribed at the head of the Roy and of the glen near Kilfinnin, patches of alluvium
or remnants of terraces on the sides of the land-straits, a little above the flat where
the waters divide. This strueture is in perfect accordance with the theory that drift
matter began to accumulate in s8uch parts at that period, when the tides in them
were first checked, or otherwise affected by the rising of the land ; and that the chan-
nels were finally closed at their present levels, solely from the long interval during
which the sea acted at such levels.
