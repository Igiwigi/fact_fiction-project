as the last of a series of chemical changes, proceeding from the simplest case of
double decomposition to the curious experiments I have just cited, each successive
link of which is bound to the preceding by the closest analogies, reasonably admit, of
a very different interpretation to that which we should put upon them when regarded
out of this connection. It is hard to draw a distinction between the decomposition
of the chloride of nitrogen and of the nitrite of ammonia. From quite independent
considerations, the conclusion is forced upon us, that the mutual attraction of the
particles of chlorine and of nitrogen plays a most important part in other cases of
chemical change. Why may we not admit that in this case the decompoxsition is de-
termined solely by these relations? The heat which attends upon. this and other
similar decompositions is, on the electro-chemical theory, as confessed by its greatest
supporters, an inexplicable enigma. Heat is the constant sign of combination, but
here it asserts is only decomposition, 80 that theory and fact are plainly at issue. On
the other hand, admitting that in this experiment the formation of the elements is a
true chemical synthesis, the evolution of heat is accounted for ; and as the elements,
chlorine and nitrogen, are far more permanent forms of matter, and less readily altered
by chemical action than the chloride of nitrogen, s0 it is reasonable to believe that the
particles of which they are composed are in a far more intimate state of combination.
The transition from these experiments to the most ordinary cases of the formation of
