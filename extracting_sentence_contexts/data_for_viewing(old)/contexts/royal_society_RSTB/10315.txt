works reflect those partitions. The cognitive holism that the
IBH envisions erases real distinctions and, if carried through
all the way, would make understanding cognition intractable
because it is everywhere.

4. In defence of the interactive brain hypothesis
(E.D.P. and H.D.J.)

Let us consider the IBH at its most radical: the claim that the
dynamics of social interaction play constitutive roles in social
cognition. The developmental version seems less controver-
sial, although its implications are not trivial (see e.g. [15]).
In fact, for any environmental factor to developmentally
shape the function of brain processes, it cannot be systemati-
cally just an informational input. To play an informational
role strictly requires the stationary functional context of the
system for which a signal serves as an input. Hence, the
developmental IBH also necessitates the possibility of inter-
action dynamics playing more than just informational roles.

Turning to the constitutional version of the IBH, we first
must stress what the claim is. We defend that the dynamical
processes involved in social interactions, which implicate not
just extra-neural processes but also relational processes
