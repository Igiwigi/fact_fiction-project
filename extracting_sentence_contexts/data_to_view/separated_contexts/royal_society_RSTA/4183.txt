the values for the coefficient of ionisation deduced by the two methods. It appears,
in fact, that the formule in which Arruentus’s hypothesis has usually found
expression, can only be regarded as accurate when applied to solutions containing
more than 100 litres of water for each gram-molecule of dissolved salt. As a qualitative expression, however, the theory is applicable to electrolytes of all
kinds, and the development of exact numerical relationships is only hindered by the
difficulty of procuring the necessary experimental data, a difficulty that in many
cases can only be overcome by the discovery of new methods of investigation, The
essential postulate of ArrHeNius’ theory is that a salt may exist both in an active
and in an inactive form as regards conductive power, so that when brought into an
electrical circuit, only part of the total weight of electrolyte is as a rule directly
operative in carrying the current. This conception finds expression in the co-efficient
of ionisation, «, which represents the proportion of the salt which is thus active in
electrolytic conduction.
