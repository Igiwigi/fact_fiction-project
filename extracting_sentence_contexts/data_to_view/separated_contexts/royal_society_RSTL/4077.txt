M. DE LA RIVE'S RESEARCHES ON THE VOLTAIC ARC. 33

discbarge being always attended by the transference of highly diffused matter, which
closes the circuit during the instant of time necessary for the formation of the arc.

3, The enormous elevation of temperature which accompanies the production of
the luminous arc, is also manifested in the electrodes, especially in the positive ones,
which become much more strongly heated than the negative.

4. Matter is thus transported from the positive electrode to the negative, a fact
which may be verified with electrodes of all kinds, but particularly with those of
charcoal.

5. The various phenomena presented by the voltaic arc, are modified to a greater
or less extent by the nature of the electrodes and by that of the surrounding medium. Thus Mr.
