Later it acquires a cavity (fig. 33, Plate 11), and
persists throughout life as a perfectly closed thin-walled sac situated beneath the
madreporic plate. Bury (5) calls it the dorsal sac, and compares it to the peri-
cardium of the Tornaria larva and of Balanoglossus. In its origin, however, and its
adult relations, it exactly corresponds to the sac in Asterina gibbosa, which I termed
the right hydroccele (15),*

This sac was shown to be the homologue of the left hydroccele by the fact that in

* Tt is difficult to account for the pulsation which Bury (4) asserts that he has seen in this organ. In
his later paper (5), however, he admits that it is only the floor of the sac which pulsates. I have never
seen any pulsation in any part of the sac, nor is there any trace of muscle-fibres to be seen in its wall.
