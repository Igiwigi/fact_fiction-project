If the state of the world is moderate, then the total endowment over the period t â‚¬ [f; + 1,300]
is Ez/tz=h with certainty. However, if climate change is severe then, with 5% probability,
E2/t2 =0.71. This reflects the fact that some members of the population are likely to be much more
severely affected by extreme climate change than others and we are currently unable to determine
whether or not we are in the high-risk group. Alternatively, we might posit that individuals are
saving or self-insuring for the next generation, and care about all its members equally. For the 95%
of the population who are not affected, E2/tz = 1.0158/.
