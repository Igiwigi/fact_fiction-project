At present his Tide Tables are calcu-

OF THE TIDES IN THE PORT OF LONDON, 17

established, it would then, no doubt, become highly probable that the simplifications
hypothetically introduced into the natural state of things were not snch as materially
to alter the general course of the phenomena. But this has not been done by any of the theoretical writers above referred to. Un-
doubtedly most of them have undertaken to show that some of the known laws of
the facts are accounted for by the theory, and thar the measures of some of the phe-
nomena agree with those which theoretical calculations give. But this has been
executed only with respect to a few of the cireumstances of the case. It has not been
shown, by any writer, that the general course of the effects produced npon the tides,
by the changes of position and distance of the heavenly bodies, is such as, according
to the mathematical reasoning, it ought to be.
