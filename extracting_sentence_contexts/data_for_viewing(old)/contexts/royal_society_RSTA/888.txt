reveals that despite more accurate data and an increasing range of theoretical approaches that
city planners can call upon to assist with using that data, there are some fundamental challenges
that appear to hamper the translation of risk assessment into action. Identifying and embracing
those up-front could strengthen the urban adaptation process—this may, in fact, turn out to be
the biggest advantage of climate risk assessment: it offers an opportunity to create a shared
understanding of the problem and enables an informed evaluation and discussion of remedial
action. If used wisely this ‘pulling power’ of data can bring together those who make decisions,
as proposed in Surminski [20].

2. Using climate risk assessment for urban decision-making

The decision-making process for adaptation at the urban governance level requires substantial
normative decision-making both prior to and in response to a climate risk assessment. A standard
depiction from the decision theory literature (e.g. [18]) frames the pathway to taking action as a
‘decision cycle’ (sometimes called the ‘policy cycle’) (figure 1).
