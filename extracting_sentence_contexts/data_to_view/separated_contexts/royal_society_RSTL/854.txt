Pirziorocicar inquiries have ever been considered as deserving
the attention of this learned Society ; and, whenever medical
practitioners, in the treatment of diseases, have met with any
circumstance which threw light upon the natural structure or
actions of any of the organs of the human body, or those of
other animals, their communications have met with a favourable
reception. The following observations derive their real importance from
offering a safe and effectual means of removing a portion of the
tongue, when that organ has taken on a diseased action, the
cure of which is not within the reach of medicine; and, as
the tongue, like many other glandular structures, is liable to be
affected by cancer, it becomes of no small importance that the
fact should be generally known. In a physiological view, they
tend to show, that the internal structure of the tongue is not. of
that delicate and sensible nature which, from its being the organ
of taste, we should be led to imagine.
