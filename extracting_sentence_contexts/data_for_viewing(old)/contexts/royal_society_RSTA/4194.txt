the algebraically maximal possible value for CHSH. The system is, however, non-contextual by
definition 7.1 and theorem 7.2: ICC in it equals the value of (Az) — (Az2) = 2, whence

CHSH — ICC = 2.

In fact, any deterministic system (one in which all probabilities are 0 or 1) is non-contextual. A
simple way of demonstrating this is as follows: a deterministic system has a single coupling,
and its subcouplings corresponding to connections (each of which is deterministic) are their only
couplings, hence maximal ones.

However, if in table 6 one decides to ignore marginal probabilities, the system is maximally
contextual (and in fact more contextual than allowed by quantum mechanics).
