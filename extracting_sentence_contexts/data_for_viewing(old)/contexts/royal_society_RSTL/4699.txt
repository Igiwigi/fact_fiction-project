(No. 13)(No. 20), (No. 13)(No. 14)?, (No. 15)(No. 16) (the numbers refer to the Cova-
riant Tables given in the 'memoir), each multiplied by a merely numerical coefficient.
'These numerical coefficients may be determined by the consideration that there being two
pairs of equal roots, we may by a linear transformation make these roots 0, 0, oo, oo,
or what is the same thing, we may write a=b=e=j=0, the covariant mnst then
vanish identically. The coefficients are thus found to be 1, —4, 50, and we have for a
covariant vanishing in the case of two pairs of equal roots,
1 (No. 13)(No. 20)

— 4 (No. 13)(No. 14}

+50 (No. 15)(No. 16).
In fact, writing a=b=e=f=0, and rejecting, where it occurs, a factor 2%, the several
covariants become functions of ca, dy; and putting, for shortness, &, y instead of ca, dy.
the equation to be verified is

1.10(z+y)(6a%+ 84% +282%*+ 8xy* + 637)
— 4.10(z+y)(8a*+2xy +39)
+50(6a*+8ay+ 64?) (a*+a% +297 +5) =0.

and this gives the function
