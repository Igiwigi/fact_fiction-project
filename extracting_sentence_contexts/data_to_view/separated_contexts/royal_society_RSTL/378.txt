S. Read June 1, 1815. Havixs often obgerved the sour disagreeable taste of the
berries of the Sorbus (or Pyrus) Aucuparia, it occurred to me
that the juice might contain an acid of a peculiar nature, and I
resolved to submit it to a strict examination, I was not at
that time acquainted with the fact, that these berries had al-
ready occupied the attention of SCHEELE, and that this philo-
sopher had pronounced their acid to be the Malic. Some preliminary experiments showed me that the juice
occasioned aprecipitation in acetate of lead and nitrate of silver;
but it produced no change in lime water, barytes water, sul-
phate of copper, nor, although it might be expected from its
very astringent taste, did it affect sulphate of iron. A quantity of the juice was poured into a solution of sugar
of lead; a curdy and somewhat heavy precipitate appeared,
which was separated by filtration; this, from its solubility in
acetic and dilute nitric acid, I judged to be malate of lead.
