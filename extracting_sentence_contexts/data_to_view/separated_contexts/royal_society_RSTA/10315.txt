“pdopting to some extent Ner’s view of the action of an halogen in forming an additive
Scompound. Such a compound might exist, but it would probably be extremely
Eunstable, and would, if left to itself, break down into water and chlorine again, or
Bnto the molecules HCl and HClO. The fact that damp chlorine, under the influence
nt light, does yield these two compounds, supports to some extent this view.
“sHowever, in the absence of direct evidence for the constitution of this compound, we
exhall simply assume that an additive molecule (H,O),, (Cl,),, is formed.
3 Illumination of the hydrogen alone, before mixing with chlorine, does not affect the
“rate of combination, so that there appears to be no direct additive compound of water
and hydrogen formed. But on the present theory we suppose that the next stage in
‘Zthe action is the formation of a still more complex molecule, by the addition of one
sor more hydrogen molecules to the complex water-chlorine molecule. A molecule
5(H, O),,, (Cla)n, (H)n, is thus formed.
