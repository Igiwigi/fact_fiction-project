(XIX.) Discussion. We may at once state that we have at present no theory to offer for the results
obtained, but it would appear that the changes in relative intensity which we have
found are facts which must be seriously considered in theories of th√© origin of spectra
in relation to the structure of the atom. It cannot be said that spectroscopy has
already passed from the descriptive to the rational state. We do not propose to discuss
in detail the bearing of our results on the application of the quantum theory to the origin
of spectra, but attention may be drawn to certain considerations.
