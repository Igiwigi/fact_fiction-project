were formed ; viz. between clots of blood and pieces of liver; between the mucous
membrane of the intestines and the gall-bladder ; between the blood in the chest and
various parts of the abdomen ; one electrode was coated with bile, and then both of
the electrodes were dipped into the blood in the chest. It was generally found that
the electrode in contact with the blood was positive, but not always ; sometimes vibra-
tions of the needle only occurred, at other times the needle went as far as 80? or 90?
and then stopped. The motions of the needle presented quite a different character
to those observed when the bile in the gall-bladder and the blood flowing from the
vena cava inferior were formed into a circuit; the latter presented a steady character,
they could be depended upon ; whereas with the former a greater effect might be pro-
duced at first, and it would then cease, or perhaps go in the opposite direction.

The following fact may not perhaps be denied, viz. that when the electrodes of a
galvanometer are brought into contact with the bile flowing from the liver and with

* If zinc and platinum be formed into an elementary voltaic circle with dilute sulphuric acid, the current,

according to the uzual mode of expression, goes from the zinc through the acid to the platinum ; the platinum
is therefore the positive electrode, and in contact with the cation hydrogen.
