should be bounded by the two expressions. In terms of form, the only difference between the two

Hamiltonians is in the prefactor of ,f1. We will denote this prefactor (without the minus) by €.
One therefore has

Moreover, the true Hamiltonian corresponding to the ICs of localization would be

with & € (Erm, &; gint] (the order is determined by the fact that —&@ inf produces the infimum, so it is
smaller and its negative is larger).

The main premise of this derivation is that if the values of gq and are close enough, then
the true Hamiltonian at localization ICs and an expression obtained under the assumptions of
resonance are close enough such that any of the expressions could be used for the construction
of the LPT. If indeed this is the case, then considerations of convenience should determine the
choice. Clearly, then it would be advantageous to use the RM Hamiltonian, because the point
of maximum energy exchange (the saddle point of the slow flow, as will be shown next) lies on
the RM and thus it would be possible to construct the entire trajectory on the RM. Even more
importantly, as the quantity that remains conserved on the slow flow RM is N, and the quantity
that one would want to control is the energy E, clearly using the RM Hamiltonian would be
advantageous because then the initial action fy could be expressed through N and related to the
