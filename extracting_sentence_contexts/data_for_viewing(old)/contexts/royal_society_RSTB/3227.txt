It will be seen that the glabella-inion line, which except in the Gibraltar skull
corresponds with the maximum length, is longer than the ophryo-inion line, but
much more so in all the members of the Neandertal group than in the Australian
skull No. 998 ; this is due to the fact that the glabellar fossa is strongly marked in the
former, and barely existent in the latter. It is, indeed, largely owing to the presence
of its associated fossa that the torus in the Neandertal skulls, as in the anthropoid
‘apes, stands out in such high relief. In Australian skulls the fossa is generally better
expressed over the brow ridges than above the glabella.

It will be observed in the next place that the nasi-inion line is shorter in the
Australian skull than the ophryo-inion line, while in the Neandertal group the
reverse is the case. This may be correlated with a second distinction of at least
equal importance, which may be most readily recognised by a reference to the profiles
of the Gibraltar skull and of the Australian, No. 998 (figs. 18, 20). In the latter the
nasal bones, which become rapidly narrower upwards, are pinched in as it were, and
pressed under the glabella, so that the nasion is situated at a point of abrupt
