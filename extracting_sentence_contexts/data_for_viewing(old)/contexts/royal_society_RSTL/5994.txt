2 Treated with iodine, the latter dissolves with a deep red colour, which gradually dis-
pears; and if the addition of iodine be continued until decoloration be no longer
ected, the resulting liquid, on being submitted to distillation, is found to consist

of iodide of ethyl, which distils over, and an iodine salt, possessing the insupport-

ably pungent odour of one of the products of the action of tin upon iodide of ethyl
at 160? C., and described by MM. Canours and Ricns as iodide of distannous ethyl.

to consist of stannic wodotriethide, (Sn,( C, H,),T) w

* Whilst engaged with these experiments, Mr. BuoxToN announced the formation of stannic ethide
(Proceedings of the Royal Society, vol. ix. p. 315), and at the same time mentioned his intention to study
the salts formed by the action of iodine, bromine, &c. upon that body ; I have therefore not proscented the
inquiry further in this direction.
