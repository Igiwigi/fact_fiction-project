steady temperatures. They evidently occur when, after the crystallisation of some
gold, the residual liquid has reached a composition of 19 or 20 atoms of aluminium.

From B onwards a new branch of the curve starts which ends in a eutectic
point at C, when the alloy contains about 21°5 atoms of aluminium. An alloy of
this composition has the low melting point of 525°. This is lower than that of any
other mixture of gold and aluminium. We have here the true eutectic of these two
metals. The second freezing point at 21 atoms probably belongs to the horizontal
line of eutectics through C, which is better marked by other points. There was
surfusion at this second freezing point, and therefore it is certain that a new solid
now began to form in the crucible. It was noticed that the alloy with 22°3 atoms of
aluminium solidified at an extremely constant temperature. This is in harmony with
the fact that we are now close to the eutectic angle.

If we pass from C towards D by adding aluminium, the upper freezing point is at
first very transient, while the lower one, belonging to the same alloy, is a very
steady temperature. But as we approach D, near 28 atoms, the reverse is true.
For example, above 26 atoms of aluminium the lower freezing point is lost, and the
upper one becomes an extremely steady temperature. Surfusion was noticed at most
of the freezing points, both upper and lower, between C and D.

At D there is a singularity in the curve; the freezing points have become very
steady temperatures, and, as usual with very steady freezing points, the curve is
flat. Ata point close to 28 atoms of aluminium a new and rapidly rising branch
of the curve begins, the earlier freezing points on it being fugitive. Moreover,
