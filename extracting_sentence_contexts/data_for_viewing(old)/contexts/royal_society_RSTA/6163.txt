correct, string-theory predicts a time-dependent dark energy density, and hence some alternative
late-time universe.

All FLRW universes that undergo accelerated expansion can be late-time attractor solutions
of the Einstein field equations. The constant energy density that drives the de Sitter expansion
is an ideal fluid with pressure to energy-density ratio w = —1, which is equivalent to T = €. For
w > -—1, equivalently T < €, we get other ‘scaling’ solutions with a power-law expansion that
is accelerating if w < -}. There is no known string-theory cosmological compactification to any
FLRW universe with late-time accelerated expansion, but one may still ask whether the premises
of the de Sitter no-go theorems exclude it. They do not exclude it, but they do impose the bound
w > —4, which is not compatible with observations.

One remaining possibility exploits the fact that transient de Sitter-like acceleration is generic for
any compactification that leads to an effective four-dimensional theory with a positive potential
V. This is easily achieved; the no-go theorems require only that V has no stationary point for
V > 0, and the de Sitter swampland conjecture imposes bounds on the magnitude of the gradient
of V. Cosmological evolution involves rolling up the potential to a maximum value, and then a
rolling down; this implies a moment at which the total energy density € is stationary and this
drives a transient phase of de Sitter-like expansion. Although this may be too short, generically,
its duration can be extended in multi-scalar models that exhibit recurrent acceleration because the
mechanism underlying this phenomenon is one that slows the fall of € from its maximum value.
It remains to be seen whether this slowing is sufficient.

Whatever the resolution of tension between string theory and the observed accelerated
expansion of our Universe, one lesson to be learned is surely that it would be naive to suppose of
