Non-vanishing of the resultants

(a) Non-vanishing of the polynomials defining B,,

Proposition 4.1. Given a non-zero polynomial a€F,[x] with dega <n, the function ar
Res(6¢(#), 5¢4a(t)) is not the zero polynomial, that is, the polynomial function

R(a) = Resi(8y(0), 5p 4a(t)) € Pala (4.1)
is not identically zero. We note that the proof of the analogous proposition in odd characteristic [1, proposition 3.1]
did not in fact rely on the characteristic being odd. We may follow the same arguments to see again
that R(a) cannot be identically zero. More accurately, the proof in [1] referred to the polynomial
Res;(Dr(t), D¢+a(#)), which, in characteristic 2, is equivalent to Res,(57(#), 5 “pa (f)) = R(a)*.
