n=1 equations (3.4a-c).
(3.3) Equation (3.4b) corresponds to an arched beat waveform and

is asymmetric in space. Equation (3.4c) corresponds to a flagellar
beat that is accelerated (decelerated) when both harmonic com-
ponents have the same (opposite) sign, and despite the fact that
the individual dynamic modes are symmetric, their superposi-
tion is not (figure 2). This occurs because the two modes have

prise a non-zero average curvature (n = 0) or higher curvature different periods (T;=T and T,=T/2). So while individual
modes that are even (1 = 2, 4, ... ,2j). In the following, we will

address three prototypical cases: (a) a flagellar beat pattern
whose curvature profile is a sinusoidal travelling wave with
amplitude C;, (b) a superposition of a sinusoidal wave and
an average curvature component Co, and (c) a superposition
of a sinusoidal wave and a second harmonic component with
amplitude C):
