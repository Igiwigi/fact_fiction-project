Figure 7. Time-frequency analyses. (a) Response-locked time frequency analysis without baseline correction. As seen, most of the theta activity seen right after
stimulus onset disappears. In the dashed box, the main increment in theta power is observed. Visually compared to the stimulus-locked, the increment is at lower
frequencies and located at posterior regions. (b) Stimulus-locked time frequency analysis with baseline correction (—0.75 to —0.25) for the difference between long
congruent trials and short congruent trials. Visually, the theta power does not seem to increase in long compared to short trials (in fact, if anything, it would be the
other way around).

Figure 8. Theta source localization. From left to right: coronal, sagittal and horizontal views for the source localization of the theta power activity (5-7 Hz) in the
first window (from 0 to 0.5 s) for the difference between incongruent and congruent trials is shown. Only the shown cluster was significant after the Monte Carlo
correction.
