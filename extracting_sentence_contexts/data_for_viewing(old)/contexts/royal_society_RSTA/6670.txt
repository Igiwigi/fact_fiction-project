that his theory is an improvement on that of Lapace, except in regard to the adop-
tion of meteorites, for he has lost the conception of the figure of equilibrium of a
rotating mass of fluid.

The object of this paper is to point out that by a certain interpretation of the
meteoric theory we may obtain a reconciliation of these two orders of ideas, and may
hold that the origin of stellar and planetary systems is meteoric, whilst retaining the
conception of fluid pressure.

According to the kinetic theory of gases, fluid pressure is the average result of the
impacts of molecules. If we imagine the molecules magnified until of the size of
meteorites, their impacts will still, on a coarser scale, give a quasi-fluid pressure. I
suggest then that the fluid pressure essential to the nebular hypothesis is, in fact, the
resultant of countless impacts of meteorites.

The problems of hydrodynamics could hardly be attacked with success, if we were
forced to start from the beginning and to consider the cannonade of molecules. But
when once satisfied that the kinetic theory will give us a gas, which, in a space
containing some millions of molecules, obeys all the laws of an ideal non-molecular
gas filling all space, we may put the molecules out of sight and treat the gas as a
plenum.

In the same way, the difficulty of tracing the impacts of meteorites in detail is
insuperable ; but, if we can find that such impacts give rise to a quasi-fluid pressure on
a large scale, we may be able to trace out many results by treating an ideal plenum.
