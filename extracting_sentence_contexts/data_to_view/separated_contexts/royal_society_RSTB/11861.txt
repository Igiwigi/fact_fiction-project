The blue line denotes the no. of NCARs present in each 500 kb window. NCARs occur in clusters across each chromosome, consistent with patterns
observed in vertebrates and in plants. (c) NCARs exhibit substantial variation in evolutionary rates of change. The 100 slowest-evolving regions are associated <=
primarily with regulation of gene expression, and the 100 fastest-evolving regions are associated with metabolism. 8
