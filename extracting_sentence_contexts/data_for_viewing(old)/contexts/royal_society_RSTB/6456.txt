the uterus masculinus and the hydatids of Morgagni may perhaps also be related to
the occasional presence in mice which have been treated for prolonged periods with
oestrone (BURROWS 1935) of keratinized cysts that lie both dorsal to the prostatic urethra
and in relation to the epididymis. In this instance, however, the correspondence is
not entirely clear, for the anatomical and embryological significance of the cysts
observed by Burrows is unknown; there is only presumptive evidence that they too
are derivatives of the primordial female reproductive tract.

The fact that none of the Miillerian vestiges found in the male reacts to progesterone
alone is of interest in view of previous observations which show that this hormone has

* The epithelial stratification observed by Wiesner in the proximal part of the urogenital sinus of
the new-born rat would itself appear to be the result of oestrogenic action, and a fact at variance with
his hypothesis. In the development of his hypothesis Wiesner does not consider the fact that oestrin
may cause extensive changes in the male reproductive organs.

no effect on tissues that have not been previously sensitized by oestrone. The in-
effectivity of progesterone is also of interest in so far as it indicates that this hormone
cannot be concerned in the embryonic differentiation of the female reproductive
tract. Whether or not the hormone that is concerned is an oestrogenic substance is
yet to be determined. It is difficult to believe that it can be in view of the fact that
these substances are not sex specific in their action.
