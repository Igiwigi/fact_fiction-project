For the GPR families that are not related to bilaterian

(e) Stem cell-specific RNA-seq using transgenic Hy_AEP sequences, a nomenclature based on Panther affiliation and
strains sequence clustering was established. All derived GPRs affiliated to
Panther families PTHR24060, PTHR24242 and PTHR24249 are
named GPRA, GPRB and GPRC, respectively. The first number in
the gene name indicates the Hydra sub-family identified in phylo-

For cell-type-specific transcriptomics, we used RNA-seq based
on mRNAs from FACS-sorted cells from body columns of ani-
mals from the three Hv_AEP transgenic strains described above ; “—
(Ecto-GFP, Endo-GFP and Cnnos1-GFP). Four biological replicates genetic trees (ie. GPRA1.x), the second number indicates the
