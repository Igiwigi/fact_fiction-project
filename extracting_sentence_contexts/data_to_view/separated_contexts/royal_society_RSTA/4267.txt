a theorem of reciprocity analogous to and including the well-known theorem con-
nected with the partitions of a number on a line. There is also a lattice theory
connected with unipartite partitions on a line, for the unit-graph of such a partition
is nothing more than a number of units and zeros placed at the points of a two-
1+m—2
t—1
Art. 96, The fact is that the theory of the two-dimensional lattice, the part-
magnitude being restricted to unity, is co-extensive with the whole theory of
partitions upon a line. Hence for such partitions we may represent the generating
Sfunetion, diagrammatically, in two ways upon a lattice as well as in two ways upon
Aa line. 8
