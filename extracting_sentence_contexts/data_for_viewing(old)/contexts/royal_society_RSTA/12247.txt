If p, and p, be both greater than zero, the contact #,«, must occur in one or more

of the enumerated permutations. :

Tf p, be zero, dy, is absent, while if p, be zero, «, has no existence, and also 3, does

lot appear.

Hence, d;, only appears when both p, and p, are greater than zero. It follows

hat the products which involve ),, only enumerate by their coefficients those per-

mutations which possess a, contacts. In fact, the absence of either «, or a, by

using Ay, to vanish, diminishes the total number of permutations which have a

definite number of major contacts ; this would not be the case if the terms comprising

Ay, as a factor did not enumerate «x, contacts; if #,«, contacts were not enumerated,

he vanishing of «, or #, would not alter the enumeration of the permutations

possessing a given number of contacts, for this given number would be complete
ithout #%, contacts at all,
