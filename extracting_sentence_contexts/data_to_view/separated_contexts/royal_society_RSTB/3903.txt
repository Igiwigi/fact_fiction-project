Small differences in general shape are, however, very inconstant, and no great
importance can be attached to them.

(iii) The Development of E. miliaris (Plate 19, figs. 19-25). E. miliaris is a form less closely related to HZ. esculentus and FE. acutus than the
latter are to one another, and its larva shows important differences. i

During the seasons of 1909-11 we always found that 1. miliaris was by far the
easiest form to rear, and that its development was the most rapid. This, we thought,
was probably connected with the fact that LH. miliaris has its habitat on the shore,
and in consequence laboratory conditions should suit it better than the other forms,
which live in deeper water. In 1912, however, the case was exactly the reverse. Although fertilizations were as easy to make as previously, yet it was only with
great difficulty that healthy larvee could be obtained in a late stage.
