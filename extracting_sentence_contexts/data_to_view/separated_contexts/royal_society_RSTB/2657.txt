It will be shown
subsequently that this particular distribution may be connected with some peculiari-
ties in the Himalayan fauna. Yet one more case of peculiar distribution deserves brief recognition. It is, of
course, a well-known fact that there are in the Indian Peninsula numerous
representatives of African animals. The majority of these, however, are forms like
Hyena, Mellivora, Gazella, amongst mammals ; Pterocles, Eupodotis, Phanicopterus,
amongst birds; Chameleon and Eryx, amongst reptiles—to quote a few well-known
examples only—and in these cases the Indian and African forms are connected by
species which inhabit South-western Asia and the Mediterranean area. Instances,
such as Golunda amongst mammals, Salpornis and Rhinoptilus amongst birds, of
genera only known in tropical Africa and India are much less common.
