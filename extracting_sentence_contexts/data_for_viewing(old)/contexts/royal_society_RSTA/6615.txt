Then, if these are gases, by what we have proved before (p. 486), the value of
L equals

ome (e+ Balog mt) + men (at Rl log 2)

where w is the mean potential energy of the four gases, and the remaining notation is
> the same as that on p, 486.
The quantities & », ¢, ¢, are not independent of each other ; in fact, there are three
relations between them. ‘Thus suppose, for example, that {A} consists of the two
components a, 8; {B} of y,8; {C} of a and y; {D} of B and 8, then the chemical

reaction is expressed by the equation

(«B) + (78) = (ay) + (68);

so that we have evidently
