The Coal Measures are essentially
an interlocked series of lenticles, thick or thin, long or short. There are, of course, many noteworthy exceptions which spring to the memory,
and these, perhaps, in the past have done more to mislead us in our general conception
of the Coal Measures than we are inclined to admit. But if these exceptions be
examined it will be found that they derive their value solely from the fact that they
are in reality local phenomena, and not actually widely spread. An exception may
hold good over a large coalfield. The Pennant Grit of the South Wales Coalfield is
an example.
