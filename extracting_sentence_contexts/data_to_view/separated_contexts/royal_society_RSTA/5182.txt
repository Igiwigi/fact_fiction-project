Tt has been explained that on this theory the mode of formal representation
H ‘dispersion without sensible absorption, is by the inclusion of differential coeffi-

 Gients of the displacement, higher than the first, in the energy function. This makes

absorption spectrum of the medium, absorption plays an important part, rendering
al phenomena anomalous, and we must then have recourse to some theory of the

the electric vibrations of the molecules and the vibrations of the medium, when
periods are very nearly alike. The sum of the orders of the differential coefficients in any term of the energ:
must usually be even; a term in which it is odd would introduce unilateral qualit

the variation of the energy-function must be retained, and they should be adjusted g
as to maintain the continuity of the manifestations of energy in crossing the interface, But the dispersional terms will introduce into the variational equation surface
integrals involving not only 8€, 8y, SZ, but also 6 (d&/da), 8 (d*é/da*),....; and y
cannot even attempt to make all these independent terms continuous across th
interface.
