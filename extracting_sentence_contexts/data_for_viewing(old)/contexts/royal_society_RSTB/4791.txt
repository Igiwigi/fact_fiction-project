Fig. 11, Specimen 8.—A transverse section through a portion of the maternal tissue
and the labyrinth to show the different kinds of maternal blood vessels.
The vessel on the left (presumably an artery) is bounded by a syncytial
lining and is passing through the labyrinth, where it will eventually open into
a large lacune. At its upper end the Basal trophoblast has followed its
course right up to the Decidua. The vessel on the right (presumably a
maternal vein) has just passed through the Basal trophoblast and has opened
into a lacune in the plasmoditrophoblast. » 85.

the fact that the scheme of placentation is essentially the same as in
Specimen 8. 100.

inmembrane. The head may be seen to be dipping down into the proamnion
and the allantois is grown out.
