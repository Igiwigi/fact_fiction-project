Dashed black line indicates the ratio calculated assuming a
—3.5%o mean ocean 5"C excursion after McCarren et al. [75] and a —4.6%o atmospheric 5°C excursion after Kozdon et al.
[76] and Diefendorf et a/. [77]. (Modified from Kirtland Turner & Ridgwell [30] fig. 4a).

the relative size of the CIE recorded between reservoirs [30], and (iii) on the synchronicity of
evidence for warming and the CIE [34]. Respectively, these methods concluded that the PETM
onset duration was less than 5 kyr, less than 3 kyr or greater than 4 kyr. In the following section, I
describe each of these three methods in greater detail and suggest that these apparently disparate
estimates for onset duration are, in fact, reconcilable.

4. Age-model independent methods for constraining Paleocene—Eocene
Thermal Maximum onset duration

(a) Method 1: lack of intermediate values in the carbon isotope excursion onset

Arguably the strongest evidence for a geologically instantaneous PETM onset comes from single
foraminifera records lacking intermediate or transitional d'3C values [28]. Kirtland Turner et al.
[25] suggested a constraint of less than 5 kyr for the PETM onset duration through application of
a sediment mixing model [74] to simulate an individual foraminifera record of the PETM CIE like
that generated from ODP Site 690 (figure 2a).
