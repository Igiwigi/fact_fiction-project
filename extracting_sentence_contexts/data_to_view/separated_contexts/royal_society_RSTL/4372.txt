GINBOTTOM appear to negative those obtained by Dr. Epwarns, and to show that metamorphosis is ouly re-
tarded by privation of light, when accompanied by reduction of temperature. But the remarkable fact above

that there was some difference in the conditions of the two sets of experiments, which should prevent us from
setting aside those statements, made (as they are) by a most trustworthy observer, until they shall have been
more fully disproved.
