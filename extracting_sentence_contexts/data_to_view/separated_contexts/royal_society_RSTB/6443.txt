Here again it is difficult
to judge how far this really represents the condition in the living animal, for the hind-
gut does not always take up this shape in the preparations, nor is even the dorso-lateral
bulge of the wall always visible; it is not seen, for example, in fig. 14, becoming visible
in this particular specimen only at the extreme hind-end. However, the condition
shown in fig. 32 can hardly be entirely an artefact, and it may be concluded that the
dorsal ciliated tract, in addition to transmitting particles down the hind-gut and
assisting in the transit of the “faecal”? masses, provides also a dorsal channel which
prevents complete blockage of the hind-gut during the transit of those masses. Such
a device seems, in fact, functionally necessary in an animal in which a ciliary current
is constantly directed backwards down the alimentary canal, and is physiologically
comparable to the ventral siphon of Balanoglossus. To return to the general analysis of the course of the food particles, there seems to
be no necessity for a constant intake of fresh food material, a single mass of food
and secretion rotating in the ilio-colon ring being sufficient to provide the animal for
many hours with a supply of finely divided material for digestion and absorption. There is some reason for believing that such a condition may be the normal one;
that it is a practicable one is certain, for an animal placed in a carmine suspension
and subsequently restored to clean sea water may exhibit a mass of carmine in the ring
for at least 24 hr. afterwards.
