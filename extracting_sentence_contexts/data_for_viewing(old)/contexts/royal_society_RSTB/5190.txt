secreting surface than can possibly be obtained from the simple cone-shaped pecten of
the Reptilian eye.

vestigial relic. This may be accounted for by the fact that the blood vessels of the
optic nerve, which divided up into capillaries and supplied the pecten, are now more
profitably employed in supplying the retina instead.

I have briefly referred to a small cecal bloodless vessel springing from the otherwise
naked disc in the Emyda granosa (Burgoma river-turtle). This projects forward towards
