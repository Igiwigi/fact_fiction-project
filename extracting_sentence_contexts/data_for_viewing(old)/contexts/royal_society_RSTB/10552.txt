person populations might be attenuated by interaction: if a
learner receives input from multiple speakers who have
recently interacted then their linguistic behaviour might be
quite similar, which would reduce the inter-speaker variation
the learner is exposed to. While this is plausible, it is worth
noting that unless all speakers a learner receives input from
are perfectly aligned and effectively functioning as a single
input source, multiple-speaker effects will simply be reduced,
not eliminated. Secondly, interaction may itself impact on
how learners use their linguistic system, a point we turn to now.

Language is a system of communicative conventions: part
of its communicative utility comes from the fact that interlocu-
tors tacitly agree on what words and constructions mean, and
deviations from the ‘usual’ way of conveying a particular
idea or concept are therefore taken to signal a difference in
meaning (e.g. [31,32]). This suggests that producing unpre-
dictable linguistic variation during communication might be
counter-functional—the interlocutors of a speaker who pro-
duces unpredictable variation might erroneously infer that
the alternation between several forms is intended to signal
something (i.e. is somehow conditioned on meaning). Language
users might implicitly or explicitly know this, and reduce the
variability of their output during communicative interaction
(but might not do so in the learn-and-recall type of task we
