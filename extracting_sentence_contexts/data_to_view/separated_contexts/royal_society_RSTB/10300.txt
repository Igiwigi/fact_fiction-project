In real rotifer
populations, however, such mutations might contribute to
the evolutionary dynamics, given the large population sizes
rotifers can reach in their natural habitats [39]. So, it is plaus-
ible that invasions by asexuals are repeatedly initiated on
relatively short timescales, which makes the competitive
interactions that occur on such timescales very relevant for
understanding the overall patterns of facultative sexual
versus obligate asexual reproduction. Third, density dependence alone can decrease the cost of
sex, which was shown by our simulations in the periodic
environments (electronic supplementary material, figure S6)
and is consistent with the fact that early reproduction loses
its advantage when the population is not growing [59]. As
our stochastic simulations contained both mechanisms, den-
sity dependence and stochasticity, it is likely that density
dependence partly influenced competition between faculta-
tive sexuals and obligate asexuals. But it should have
done so equally for the whole range of environmental auto-
correlation, and thus not have changed the general pattern,
because most of the time populations were close to their car-
rying capacity (see example, simulation runs; electronic
supplementary material, figure S3).
