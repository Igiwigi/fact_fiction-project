The digestive tube
close to the mouth, in one specimen of B. Ceres, contained a mass of apparently animal
matter ; but it was 80 far decomposed or digested that I could not determine its exact
nature. The diverticula of both Pipalium and Rhynchodenus contain numerous grega-
riniform parasites, which are also to be found imbedded in the neighbouring tissue:
hardly any diverticulum is free from them, and they are usually massed together at the
blind ends of the diyerticula,

Water-vasenlar System.—In vertical sections of the body of Bipalium and Rhyncho-
demus, such as those figured on Plate X., there are to be seen a pair of rounded spaces
lying one on each side of a region immediately aboye the ambulacral line, and thrown
out into relief by the fact that they are always very little tinged with the carmine-
staining fluid, In Bipalium these spaces are separate, but in Rhynchodemus they are
connected by a broad transyerse tract; and when sections of this animal are viewed under
the microscope, the resulting figure, resembling somewhat a pair of spectacles in shape,
is the most striking feature of the preparation: The spaces are irregularly oval in form,
with the long axis of their figure directed transversely ; and throughout the entire length
of the body they present nearly the same figure on section, except in the region of the
Pharynx and generative organs, where they are necessarily somewhat contracted. 'The
Spaces bear a constant relation in position to the oyiduct and testis in the anterior
portion of the body. The oviducts lie, in Bipalium Diana, B. Proserpina, and Khyn-
chodemus Thwaitesii, just above the space on each side, somewhat exteriorly to its middle
line; whilst in Bipalium Ceres they lie just within the space itself, but in the same region
as in Þ.
