On one occasion a worker-like female laid seven ova in
captivity, but, unfortunately, they failed to develop, and I am unable to state
whether they were fertilised or not. On account of the condition of the gonads, I
was at first inclined to regard the forms as being neoteinie individuals of a some-
what unusual type. The fact that the soldiers also exhibit a total absence of any
indications of inhibition or degeneration of the gonads, has contributed largely to
my abandoning this belief. Furthermore, the slightly enlarged head, the general
chitinisation of the body, the condition of the eyes, and the very variable occurrence
of curiously shrivelled wing vestiges, all argue in favour of their being worker-like
forms. I consider that they exhibit the first step in the evolution of the worker
caste, a conclusion which, if correct, is in full accordance with the presence of other
primitive features associated with Archotermopsis.
