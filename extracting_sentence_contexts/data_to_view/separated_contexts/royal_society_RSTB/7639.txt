However, undoubted detrital
cacilutite grains are numerous at certain conglomeratic horizons and are never recrystal-
lized to a coarse mosaic. But the recrystallized grains show transitions to unaltered pele-
cypod and echinoderm fragments and often have an irregular shape incompatible with an
inorganic origin (figure 24, plate 2). These facts, taken with the macroscopic evidence of
abundant shelly matter, provide conclusive evidence for Flettâ€™s interpretation. The intense
recrystallization to which the shelly matter has been subjected is probably related to the
freedom of movement of fluids in the original porous sand. The calcite mud rim invites
comparison with the concentric laminae of ooliths and it would not be misleading to
describe the grains of the Sutton Stone as incipient or superficial ooliths.
