In Plate XXVII. is represented a section of the beach formed along the outside of
Folkestone Harbour. This section was taken with great accuracy, after the ground
swell before referred to had removed most of the loose pebbles from it ; 80 that the
Section may be considered as representing the plane upon which the progressive mo-
tion of the pebbles is carried on. Its slope is in the proportion of 1 to 9, nearly, and
(with the exception of that part near the summit where there remained a bank of
pebbles beyond the reach of the previous tides,) the surface of the plane corresponds
very nearly with a straight line, which, considering that it is a natural formation, is a
fact worthy of notice. I think this plane may be considered as representing the average dimensions and
inclinations of the surfaces over which the beach travels along this coast, and I have
therefore generally assumed such an one for the present purposes. Upon such an
inclination, the loose pebbles are in contact with each other; and although their
depth upon the plane is constantly varying, yet, for the sake of conveying a general
idea, we may assume the average to be about six inches, extending between high- and
low-water marks.
