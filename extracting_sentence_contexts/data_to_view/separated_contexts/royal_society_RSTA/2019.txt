After substitution

In terms of the functionip, initial and boundary conditions (2.22)—(2.24) can be rewritten in the
following form:
t=0, Uy =0; (2.27)
y=0, Up= ce*t (2.28)
and yo, U>0. (2.29)


Comparing the magnitude of the second term on the left-hand side with the term on the right-
hand side of equation (2.26), it gives the characteristic scale for the time of solute transport in the

Introducing the non-dimensional variables as t= 1t/ty, Y=y/g, equation (2.26) will take the

The coefficient in the first term on the left-hand side of equation (2.32) is equal to t/t, and can
be estimated using formulae (2.30) and (2.31). Asa result, t¢/ta = O(e2¥/1-)), Accounting for this
estimate and for the fact that ry < €o, the first term on the left-hand side of equation (2.32) can be
ignored. Dropping this term in (2.32) and returning to the variables t, y, equation (2.26) can be
rewritten in the following form:
