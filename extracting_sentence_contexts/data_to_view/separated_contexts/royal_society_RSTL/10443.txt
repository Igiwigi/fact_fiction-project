and GEGENBAUR'S © Selachians,” plates 11-20) we 8ee that the extra-branchials are
feeble, the intra-branchials typical, and the branchial rays distinet; in the Skates or
Rays these fringing cartilages are much dilated externally, and these dilatations are
articulated together and guppress the extra-branchials. The two upper labials (Plate 3, figs. 1-3, 1.1.) are but little united at the middle,
and each has a fenestra in it ; on the right side there is a lesser hole. The labials of the sueking disk (7.1.) are larger than in the last instance, and this
corresponds with the fact that this species is very generalised and archaic. The spiracular cartilage (Plate 3, figs. 1, 2, $p.c.) is confluent with both the * tegmen
tympani ” and the © otic process ” of the suspensorium. When these parts are studied, not only after dissection but als with all their
enclothing structures, we find that the ordinary Batrachian larva is indeed a kind
of © Cyclostomous ” fish, and the Lamprey and this larva mutually explain each other.
