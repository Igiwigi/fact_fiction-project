community, the field calculus aims for a suitable trade-off between expressiveness and simplicity.
Though a wide set of aggregate computations can be expressed, it also plays the role of a
mathematical tool one can fruitfully exploit to: (i) define general properties of interest and prove
their validity [40] (typically, by induction on the syntactic structure of an expression), (ii) isolate
fragments with specific behavioural properties [41], (iii) design new mechanisms by extension
[42], and (iv) pave the way towards sound implementation of tool support [35]. We here recap
some of the basic properties that have been investigated so far:

— Global-local coherence. Coherence of the aggregate field computations in a distributed
execution is maintained for field calculus by tracking which nbr operations align with
one another, meaning that they are part of the same aggregate operation and should
share information via the field output by nbr. Determining alignment has a number
of subtleties stemming from the fact that execution may proceed differently on different
devices, and that any given function may be called multiple times. As a consequence, two
neighbouring devices may each evaluate a single nbr statement in the code many times,
with some of these evaluations aligning and sharing information, while others do not
align and remain isolated. Alignment is thus the local implementation of the aggregate
notion of a field’s domain, and the key to ensuring a provable relationship between

“In fact, it is sufficient to track only the values supplied to nbr operations and the context of those operations.


aggregate specification and local implementation. The minimal syntax of field calculus
has allowed its semantics, including alignment, to be proven correct and consistent [19].
— Self-stabilization. What kind of behavioural properties can we analyse given an arbitrary
