tion of each one separately. Reference to the Appendix will show that such
treatment would be much too lengthy. The converse method has therefore been
adopted, by classifying the data and making a factorial analysis of them; thus we
have dealt with the various causes which may influence the rise of the flowering-
curve by bringing together all our data on this matter, and then showing how the
date and rate of the rise have been controlled by soil-temperature, soil-fertility,
sowing-date, water supply, and so forth.

As a preliminary to this classification of the data for discussion we have made an
initial presentment of it in historical sequence and graphic form (figs. 3-7) with full
descriptive legends on the page opposite to each figure. This arrangement is the
most compact and easy of reference possible with such a mass of data, and we would
call the readerâ€™s attention to the fact that these legends, though printed in small
type, are an essential part of this communication, and are not merely repetitions of
statements made elsewhere in the text.

Data AVAILABLE FOR ANALYSIS.
It is not necessary to deal separately with the methods employed in procuring
the data, as they were simply variations on those described in the two preceding
Parts. It is fortunate that the flowering records were obtained daily in 1909, though

their significance was not then fully understood, so that in the two following years
