We have so far found no trace of stomata on the upper surface of
the leaf. The lamina of the leaf occasionally has outgrowths on its lower surface, similar to
those on the petiole and stem (see photograph 7 and fig. 16). It is a curious fact,
that in the best sections of the leaf, almost every cell contains a round mass of
carbonaceous matter, very suggestive of a nucleus. We do not desire to lay any
Stress on this appearance, but its constancy in the best preserved preparations is
certainly remarkable, (See photograph 7 and fig. 16.)

The following conclusions result from our observations :â€”

1. The lamina of the leaf in Zyginodendron had a distinctly bi-facial structure with
well differentiated palisade and spongy parenchyma.
