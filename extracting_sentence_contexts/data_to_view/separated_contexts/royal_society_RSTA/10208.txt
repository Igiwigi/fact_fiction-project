In applying « to correct the observed densities of gases at atmospheric pressure,
we are met with the consideration that « is itself a function of temperature, and that
the value of « really required for our purpose is that corresponding to 0° C., at which
temperature the weighing vessels are charged with gas.* In the case of the principal
gases « is so small that its correction for temperature was not likely to be important
for the purpose in hand, but when we come to CO, and N,O the situation might well
be altered. If we know the pressure-equation of the gas, there is no difficulty in
calculating a correction to « in terms of the critical constants. I had, in fact,
caleulated such a correction for carbonic acid after VAN DER WAALS, when I became
acquainted with the memoir of D, BerruEtor,t in which this and related questions
are admirably discussed. The “reduced” form of VAN DER WAALS’ equation is

(7+5) (0-8) = 80;

pressure, volume and temperature being expressed in terms of the critical values. From this we find
