temperature. The density of the medium at 5° C. above the critical temperature was
determined from the float, and as the total weight of the ethylene was known the vol-
ume that it occupied could be computed. This was repeated at a lower pressure when
the mercury was at a lower level in the bomb (fig. 1). The mercury levels were meas-
ured by means of a scale beside the bomb. From this data, the volume of the bomb
per unit length, and the total volume of the ethylene when the mercury was at any
height could be calculated. The cross-section in the bomb had been previously
measured with the original tubing and it was found to agree with the value deter-
mined from this calibration. Results of average density determinations at 50-10
and 50-87 atmospheres are given in Table III and represented in fig. 3. Evidence
that the density of the system was uniform is given by the fact that the results of the
average density calculations agree with the values obtained by float observations.

Rate of Establishment of Equilibrium

By rate of establishment of equilibrium is meant the rate at which the density
varies in approaching a constant value, subsequent to definite temperature or
pressure changes in the medium. As this final value is reached asymptotically, the
time required is rather indefinite. Since the initial and final density values are
definite enough, the time for the medium to reach a value half-way between the two
