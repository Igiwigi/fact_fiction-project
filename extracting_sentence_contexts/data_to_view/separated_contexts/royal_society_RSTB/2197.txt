interossei. The fact that after degeneration of the lowest four cervical and of the Ist thoracic
nerves, excitation of the IInd thoracic or of the cords of brachial plexus still
evokes a flexion of the wrist and of the digits, in which the terminal phalanges
of the latter are flexed on the middle phalanges as well as these last on the proximal,
might be taken to prove that the flexor profundus digitorum was in action, and
therefore innervated by the IInd thoracic. The flexor profundus is, it is true, usually
innervated in part by the IInd thoracic, but the above fact is not the proof of it. In Man the flexor profundus (perforans) is the flexor of the terminal phalanges on the
middle phalanges, and the sublimis does not flex the former. In the Macaque both
profundus and sublimis flex similarly the terminal and middle and proximal phalanges ;
if the middle phalanges are prevented from flexion (as presumably under action of
the interossei and lumbricales), the sublimis cannot flex the terminal phalanx,
although the profundus can.
