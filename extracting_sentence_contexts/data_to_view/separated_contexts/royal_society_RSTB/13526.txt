Interestingly, neurons encoding elapsed or
larity of isochronous acoustic sequences, as evidenced by remaining time are tuned to the tapping rate, generat-
neural responses to sound omissions in an auditory metro- ing period-dependent subpopulations for pulse processing
nome captured by scalp EEG on macaques [115]. Moreover, within MPC [122,123]. These neural signals are far from
the fact that macaques show human-like frequency-following static. MPC cells are recruited in rapid succession producing
EEG responses elicited by fast acoustic periodicities suggests a progressive neural pattern of activation (called moving
that their auditory system can precisely encode fine sound bumps) that flexibly fills the time interval corresponding to
timing, thus providing a critical basis for coordination of one pulse period (figure 2b). This neural pattern may thus pro-
movement with incoming acoustic inputs [116].
