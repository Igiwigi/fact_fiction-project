THaT wonderful production of the human mind, the undulatory theory of light, with the
phenomena for which it strives to account, seems to me, who am only an experimentalist,
to stand midway between what we may conceive to be the coarser mechanical actions of
matter, with their explanatory philosophy, and that other branch which includes, or
should include, the physical idea of forces acting at a distance ; and admitting for the
time, the existence of the ether, I have often struggled to perceive how far that medium
might account for or mingle in with such actions, generally ; and to what extent experi-
mental trials might be devised which, with their results and consequences, might contra-
dict, confirm, enlarge, or modify the idea we form of it, always with the hope that the
corrected or instructed idea would approach more and more to the truth of nature, and
in the fulness of time coincide with it. The phenomena of light itself are, however, the best and closest tests at present of
the undulatory theory ; and if that theory is hereafter to extend to and include other
actions, the most effectual means of enabling it to do 80 will be to render its application
to its own special phenomena clear and sufficient. At present the most instructed persons
are, I suppose, very far from perceiving the full and close coincidence between all the
facts of light and the physical account of them which the theory supplies. If perfect, the
theory would be able to give a reason for every physical affection of light ; whilst it does
not do 80, the affections are in turn fitted to develope the theory, to extend and enlarge
it if true, or if in error to correct it or replace it by a better. Hence my plea for the
possIble utility of experiments and considerations such as those I am about to advance.
