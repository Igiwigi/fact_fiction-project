geometry also relaxes the pulse duration requirement for IAP generation [98].

However, the generation of isolated attosecond pulses remained quite difficult for quite some
time, due to the need for both carrier envelope stabilization of high-energy pulses from the
ultrafast Ti:sapphire amplifier (which requires interferometric stabilization in a high-power
laser environment), and the need for pulse compression of the high-energy output of the
amplifier system, which limits the pulse energy available and thus the HHG efficiency [121,123].
Overall, between the very significantly lower flux, and the additional technical complexity, many
successful attosecond dynamics experiments have more simply made use of the attosecond pulse
trains (APTs) that are inherent in the HHG process. As a generalization, the ability to generate a
single attosecond pulse, as opposed to a train, is most useful in characterizing few-femtosecond
phenomena. In the case of truly attosecond dynamics, the APT increases the data acquisition rate
without introducing ambiguities, and in fact allows in some cases for a combination of spectral
and temporal resolution that is not possible with IAPs [124].

More recently, as interest has shifted to HHG in the soft X-ray spectral region driven by mid-
infrared lasers, the generation of isolated attosecond pulses may well be more the default for
HHG rather than an extra effort. In driving HHG with longer wavelengths, the interval between
optical cycles becomes progressively longer, while the effect of the plasma generation on the
phase-matching conditions increases. Furthermore, the absorption depth of the generated light
increases, making phase-matching more selective. The result is that the time window of phase-
matched HHG shortens, resulting in stronger confinement of the emission to a single burst.
