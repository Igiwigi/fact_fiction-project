538 MR. FRANCIS DARWIN ON STOMATA.

the leaf, owing apparently to variations in the number of stomata. It is necessary
to be aware of this fact, otherwise the observer might interpret his hygroscope
readings as showing a variation in stomatal aperture in the different regions of the
leaf, It is obviously necessary in all these cases to make all observations in one
given region. The use of the hygroscope as an index of the condition of the stomata depends on
the assumption that in adult leaves the stomatal transpiration is so much greater
than the cuticular transpiration that the latter may be practically neglected,

Prerrer* discusses this question and states that if a small glass vessel is cemented
on to the astomatal surface of Ficus elastica or Ilex Aquifolium the glass soon
becomes dewed with moisture. He also quotes GARREAU’S results to show that con-
siderable amounts of water vapour pass through the astomatal surface,

On the other hand Srautt shows that cobalt-paper placed beneath small vessels
cemented to the astomatal surface of Ficus elastica, Begonia manicata, Hedera Helix,
do not change colour for a long time.
