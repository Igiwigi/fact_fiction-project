that © the globe of the earth may be regarded as one great magnet having four magne-
tical poles, or points of attraction, two of them near each pole of the equator; and that
©in those parts of the globe which lie near any of those magnetical poles, the needle is
chiefly governed thereby, the nearest pole being always predominant over the more
Sremote.” It is in this, its original signification, bearing date 80 early as 1683, that I
Shave employed the term © magnetic pole.” The magnetic surveys which have been 80
\Dearefully and systematically made in the course of the present century over almost
*Sall the accessible parts of the globe, may now be considered to have fully confirmed
= the truth of Harry's remarkable anticipation, and may be claimed in full justification
Sby those who. following in the steps of our sagacious and illustrious countryman, employ
the terms which he was amongst the first to use (and the first to assign to them their
-S true significancy), in the same sense in which he himself employed them. The Halleian
'| S hypothesis, and the incontroyertible facts on which it rested, were for a time obscured
'S by the prevalence of a uniaxial hypothesis, in which the points of maximum force were
2 asumed to be identical with the points where the inclination is 90?; around which, as
'Z their centre, the isodynamic and isoclinal lines were supposed to be arranged symmetri-
\S cally in parallel lines; hence the term magnetic pole came, in the uniaxal hypothesis,
b= to be attached to the points where the inclination is 90*, that element being the easter

© ance of the uniaxial hypothesis has gradually yielded to the progressive advance of
|S observational knowledge; and one of its ablest expositors (BoT), as far back as the com-
E mencement of the present century, was constrained to admit that, even in the case of
a apparently the most simple of the three elements (viz. the Inclination), a single magnetic
* axis would afford no snfficient explanation of the phenomena, unless it were supple-
mented by the supposition of subordinate centres ; whilst as regarded the known facts
