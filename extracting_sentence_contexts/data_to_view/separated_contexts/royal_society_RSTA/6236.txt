For the transition cases, we selected a TX SC image (acquired on 24 June 2012 in the Chukchi
Sea) and a TX SM image (acquired on 31 July 2018 in the Fram Strait). Based on the appearance of
ice floes and dates/locations, the two TX images represent the floe conditions during transition
rather than during fracturing (see electronic supplementary material, figure S6a,b). This is also
partly supported by the fact that the shape factors from the two TX images have the floe size
distributions close to the transition cases (figure 62). It should be noted that TX images taken
right after the spring breakup are often difficult to delineate the floe boundary and derive
the floe size, as TX images contain speckle noises and have lower resolutions than MEDEA
images. The comparison of the floe size distribution (in 4) shows that the power-law regimes of the two
TX cases have steeper slopes than the fracturing cases (figure 6a).
