The binding energy of this ground level is found to be 4:4eV. As the con-
figuration of this level, ifa */7, term, is exactly the same as that of the ground level of O5 we
are considering, except that the orbitals are three-quantum ones, it seems unlikely that our
estimate of 3-8 eV as the binding energy of O; Â°//, is in error in excess. Some further evidence
to this end is afforded by the fact that the binding energy of F,, which is admittedly not very
well known, indicates that, for molecules containing nearly complete two-quantum shells,
the binding energy per bond is greater, not less, than 2-5eV. We therefore take 1 eV as a
reasonable estimate of the electron affinity of O;. The internuclear distance in the ground state is probably somewhat greater than in that
(1-20A) of the neutral molecule.
