figs. 12 & 13, mm, are but modified medullary rays, and
that they are 80 modified, not for the purpose of transmitting the vascular foliar bundles,
but as an effect of their presence, which is a very different thing. In my last memoir I called attention to the fact that the foliar bundles originated
from the line of junction between the vascular medullary cylinder and the ligneous zoneÂ®. * T haye to correct an error into which I fell on this point in the text of my previous memoir. TI had clearly
ascertained that the foliar bundles sprang from small vessels occupying the plane where the outer surface of the
vrascular medullary cylinder and the inner one of the ligneous zone were in contact, and I came to the con-
clusion that they belonged to the latter rather than to the former ; but T now see that this was a mistake.
