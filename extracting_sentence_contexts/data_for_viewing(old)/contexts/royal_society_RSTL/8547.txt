leaves no room for doubting that these deflected laminw have been connected with a lateral branch, and not

OF THE FOSSIL PLANTS OF THE COAL-MEASURES, 53

Burntisland stems are examples either of the genus Asferophyllites or of Sphenophyllum.
The absence of leaves in these Scotch specimens renders it impossible at present to deter-
mine with which of these two genera they ought to be associated, Before attempting
to ascertain the bearing of these facts upon the question of the systematic position of the
plants, we must examine some other organs which, I am now satisfied, belonged to
similar plants.

The first inquiry which snggests itself is, What are the relations snbsisting be-
tween the stems described in these pages and the numerous fruits that have been
described and figured by various observers on previous occasions? In 1853 Dr. Hooker
published, in the * Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society of London,” yol. x. p. 199,
adescription and figure of a terminal strobilus from Carluke, to which he gave the name
of Volkmannia Morrissi. E1cHwALD, in his © Lethea Rossica,” tab. xv. fig. 1, figures,
under the name of Annularia densifolia, a stem with eight verticils of circular nodal
scars, and with cones given off from each verticil, similar cones having obviously been
detached from the scars referred to. GENT figures, in his © Die Steinkohlen-Formation
