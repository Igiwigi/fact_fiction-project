Rather, as approaches to the discrete simulation of fluid are now entering their
vigorous maturity, we believe that a new synthesis best describes their place
in computational fluid dynamics. Despite their many merits, discrete simulation
methods are obviously not a panacea. In fact, many notions and concepts from
PDE discretization have proven extremely valuable in boosting their quality

One contribution of 26 to a Theme Issue ‘Discrete simulation of fluid dynamics: methods’.

and overall performance, a statement that is particularly true for the widely
popular Lattice Boltzmann (LB) method, de facto a powerful blend of particle
and grid methods. This Theme Issue provides the reader with a record of the state of the art
in the field and contains a wide range of contributions, covering many aspects
relevant to the physics of complex flows, across many scales of motion and type
of applications. This Theme Issue collects specific contributions to methodological advances.
