= gpectively of minimum and maximum. The observations of one of the elements (the
£ Declination), extending uninterruptedly at both stations over eleven entire years, or
& from 1841 to 1851 inclusive, distinctly pointed out 1848 as the year of maximum as
S well as 1843 as the year of minimum.

This discovery of the existence of a periodical inequality, common to the magnetic
& disturbances of larger amount, and to those more regular diurnal magnetic variations

of which the sun has been long recognized as the primary cause (inasmuch as they
conform systematically to laws depending on solar time), was regarded as affording
presumptive evidence of the subsistence of a causal connexion common to those two
classes of phenomena, which presumption was corroborated by facts adduced in the
£ame communication, proving that the disturbances are themselves subject, on the
average, to a well-marked diurnal period, which is also regulated by solar time.

The periodical inequality thus manifested, having its opposite phases of maximum
and minimum separated by an interval of five years, and of which the cycle might
therefore be conceived to include about ten of our solar years, did not appear to
connect itself with any of those divisions of time with which we are conversant as
