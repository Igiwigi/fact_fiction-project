and IV give detail of all the fine structure of the 44 5165, 4737, 5635 and 6191 groups
observed on these plates, together with the additional structure in the case of the
AA 5165 and 4737 bands obtained from are photographs. ‘The heads only have been
measured in the 4380 “ group of three,” and in the red group. There is no doubt that the
former group constitutes a part of the Swan spectrum, representing, in fact, the vibrational
transitions (2, 0), (3, 1), and (4, 2); but the complexity of its fine structure, which

appears different from that of the other bands, will necessitate a third or fourth order
photograph before it can be analysed. The quality of the definition obtained makes
it probable that the relative values of the wave-lengths recorded in Tables I, Il and
III may be relied on to about 0-002 A.U., and those of Table IV to about 0-005 AU. The absolute values were obtained from measurements of a number of plates, and are
probably correct to 0-01 A.U., excepting for the heads of the red group, for which the
error may average 0-02 A.U. Tables V and VI give the wave-lengths of the heads of the
violet and the red groups.
