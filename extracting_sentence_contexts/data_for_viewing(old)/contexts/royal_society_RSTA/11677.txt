32 PROFESSOR T. A. HEARSON ON THE KINEMATICS OF MACHINES.

Also all the combinations of the I with OU motions previously detailed have their
counterpart in spherical mechanisms.

RevLeavx has compared one of the best known spherical mechanisms, known as
Hooker's joint, with its plane counterpart, OLDHAM’s Coupling, p. 27. In the latter
there are three links which are supposed to be equal and infinite. In the former
there are three links, the lengths of which are each equal to a quadrant, the fourth
being shorter. In Hooxe’s joint it is well known that the angular velocity ratio of
the connected shafts is not constant, whereas in OLDHAM’s Coupling it is.

It is interesting to notice that these two facts immediately follow from Law I., the
sum of the four angles of the spherical quadrilateral not being constant.

In spherical mechanisms the relative lengths of the links may be represented by
the magnitude of the angles at the centre of the sphere which they subtend. This
suggests that a spherical movement may be represented and distinguished from -a
plane movement by inserting the value of the angles between the letters O and U,
which represent the motions.* Thus for examples :——

The spherical counterpart of OoOo is BOaoBOaof, expressing the fact that
opposite links are equal to one another.

Of 0070U, the spherical counterpart is BO«O?a0BUB where B > a.
