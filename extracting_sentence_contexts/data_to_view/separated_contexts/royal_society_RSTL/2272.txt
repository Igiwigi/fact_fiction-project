tricity, | has engaged: the attention/' of those- whose-talents

enter therefore, upon -a further --investigation/of 'this»interest-
ing subject with much diffidence ; but having, by an easy
method, obtained a series of results, apparently calculated to
advance our knowledge of it, I am led to hope that a short
account of my inquiries may be honoured by the notice of the
Royal Society. It has been long since observed by one of the most active
contributors * to the success of modern science, that the heat
evolved by a metallic body, whilst transmitting an electrical
charge, is in some inverse ratio to its conducting power—a
principle generally admitted, not only as a reasonable deduc-
tion, but also as being established by a'great variety of facts;
I have therefore sought to measure the relative degree of
heat, so evolved, by various metallic substances in a gazeous
medium such as air, and thus to discover their precise rela-
tions as conductors of electricity. I employed for this purpose a very simple instrument,
(represented by fig. 1. in the annexed plate,) which may be
