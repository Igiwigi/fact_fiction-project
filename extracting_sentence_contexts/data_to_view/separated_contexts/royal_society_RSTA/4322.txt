The algebraic functions can be regarded as uniform functions on a
Riemann surface which covers the z-plane twice, the branch-points being at the
points ¢;, @,..+ 42. Now join the point e,,,. to each of the points e, ¢., @3,... C41
Then each of the sheets, regarded as an infinite plane bounded by these lines, is
represented conformally on one of the (n + 1)-gons in the ¢-plane; by taking two
adjacent (m+ 1)-gons, we obtain a 2n-gon, which corresponds to the fact that by
taking the two z-planes, and connecting them along the line ¢,,.¢,,:, we obtain the
Riemann surface as dissected by n cross-cuts. a The analytical connexion between the variables in a hyperelleptic form and the
“ uniformising variable ¢ is therefore given by the equations of §5. It can be shown
8 that the differential equation found there is, as might be expected, one of Kiem’s*
2 “ unverazweigt ” differential equations for hyperelliptic forms.
