confirms the usefulness of the simple Zz Yukawa model for the purpose of studying the lower
bound. The reason for this agreement simply lies in the fact that the bottom Yukawa coupling is
much smaller than that of the top quark, with the latter dominating the dynamics near the lower
bound. The situation is different at large Higgs self-coupling: here, the different number of scalar
degrees of freedom plays a substantial role which leads to a narrowing of the IR window, now
having its centre near 200 GeV.

This model is also of interest, because it is used for non-perturbative studies of the Higgs
mass bounds in lattice simulations [34-37]. The chiral gauge structure of the standard model is so


far not accessible on the lattice, but this chiral model suffices to address quantitative questions,
while extrapolating to the full standard model with the aid of perturbation theory. In fact, the
same mechanism for relaxing the conventional lower bound by means of higher-order operators
that we discovered for the Z) model is also active in this chiral model [13,14]; the corresponding
plot upon an inclusion of a ~d3,a(b* 6) operator looks identical to figure 1b; see fig. 4 in [14].
The existence of this mechanism is also confirmed by lattice studies [38-41], corroborating the
functional RG studies.

The chiral model nevertheless has a technical disadvantage, as the chirally broken (Fermi)
phase necessarily goes along with the appearance of massless Goldstone modes. In the full
standard model, they disappear through the Higgs mechanism, while they have to be removed
by hand in the model studies both on the lattice as well as in the functional RG studies. This
introduces a quantitatively small degree of model dependence which cannot be removed as a
matter of principle. To avoid the full complexity of the standard model, but nevertheless acquire
