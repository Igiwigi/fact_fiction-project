Sand hence writing 1 for Y, and —1, —@, —«? for Z, we have
Bpo=2f=—1PA(p—2), b+anMef=—p (fot), b+oo—2af=— Af —a/S);
Zand hence the product of the three factors is —y%%(4*—2?(y*—o*2)(y*—w*z?)*, which is
equal to =z/2(x*—2#)(y*+2)?, which yanishes in virtue of the assumed equation x=0. HThis shows that the function 6+ — 8f* + 6bef contains the factor x. IT have not veri-
Sfied @ posterioni, but T assume it to be true, that it contains in fact the factor a*, and con-
quently that the expressions for ,, y,, 2, are rational and integral functions of (@, y, 2)
Sof the degree 25, and containing respectively the factors #, y, 2. AQ 46. In the theory of the cubic, a point which depends linearly upon a given point
may be termed a derivative of s8uch point.
