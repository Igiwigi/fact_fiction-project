Similarly, the standard
deviation reduces by 22%. This suggests that even if the ConvOff experiments were re-tuned
to bring their control simulations into closer agreement with the standard model versions, the
overall range in their cloud feedbacks would not be greatly reduced, supporting our initial
conclusions above. We should of course bear in mind the fact that this estimate of the impact of retuning is very
simplistic and could be inaccurate. However, there are reasons to be optimistic. First, most of the
ConvOff feedback estimates are closer to the standard ones after they are rescaled.
