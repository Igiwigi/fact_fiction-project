The assumption of a velocity potential would lead
to the value v = 2,1 while v = 3 is suggested by the previous assumption. In order
to simplify subsequent proceedings we shall choose the smaller value and deduce the
value of « from LANGLEY’s experiments. We have now to consider the effect of the air on the slightly distorted thin surface
which represents the boomerang, and in order to surmount the difficulties introduced
by the fact that the velocities at different points vary, as well as the directions of
the normals to the surface, we are driven to make some hypothesis. Now the effect of the air-pressure upon a plane surface in uniform motion may be
obtained by integrating over it, provided that we regard the effect due to any small
portion as proportional to the area of that portion. }
