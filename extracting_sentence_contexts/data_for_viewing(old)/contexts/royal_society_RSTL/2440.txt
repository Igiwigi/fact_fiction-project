28 THE REV. W. WHEWELL ON THE EMPIRICAL LAWS

It appears that this correction changes from positive to negative four times in the
course of the year, and hence may be approximately represented by m 8in 2 (9 — )
when 0 is the sun's right ascension. But the maximum and minimum values in dif-
ferent parts of the year are of unequal magnitude and at unequal intervals. This may
be reconciled with an expression of the form m 8in 2 (0—p) +n 8in (0 — »); and we
might determine m, n, /, , 80 as to make the expression agree nearly with the result
of observation. In fact, however, this would not be worth while, except we had the
empirical law confirmed by the results of observations at other places; for the greatest
values of this correction are — 4” and + 3», We here exclude the effects of the
equation of time.

It is not difficult to see why the solar correction assumes such a form as this. It
includes the corrections due both to the sun's declination and his parallax. The
former effect is twice a minimum and twice a maximum in the course of a year ; the
latter once only. The two effects are not immediately separated in the tables, because
the sun's perigee being nearly stationary, the cycle of changes due to solar parallax
and the double cycle of changes due to solar declination coincide.

When the form and amount of the solar correction are more exactly determined, it
