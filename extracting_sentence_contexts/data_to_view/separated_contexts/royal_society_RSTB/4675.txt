W. G. RIDEWOOD ON THE CALCIFICATION OF THE

calcification of the centra as seen in transverse section are very striking and may
prove to be of some taxonomic value, Hassx did not succeed in expressing and
co-ordinating the facts in a scheme that adequately meets the requirements of the
ease. (See Views of Later Authors, p. 344.)

Fic. 3—Hassr’s diagrams of cyclospondylous (1), tectospondylous (2), and asterospondylous (3)
vertebre, representing transverse sections of anterior caudal vertebrie of the three types, cut midway
between the anterior and posterior ends of the centrum,

A, radiating lamelle characteristic of asterospondylous vertebr ; C, remains of the notochord ;
D, primary double-cone calcification of the middle-zone cartilage; E, membrana elastica externa,
the outer limit of the notochordal sheath ; H, hemal arch ; N, neural arch ; T, one of the concentric
lamelle characteristic of tectospondylous vertebra, The cartilage next internal to the ring D is
inner-zone cartilage, that between the rings D and E is outer-zone cartilage. Copied from Hassr
(15, A, pp. 41, 44, 48). The groups of fishes as delimited by Hass are, with certain exceptions, natural
groups, which is to be accounted for by the fact that his ultimate classification was
not based upon the characters of the vertebre solely; he wisely took also into
consideration the characters of the placoid scales and teeth, the basal cartilages of
the pectoral fin, and the presence or absence of an anal fin, and in difficult cases,
where the features of the centra did not provide the confirmatory evidence that he
needed, he was inclined to disregard, or at all events to belittle, the value of such
evidence, with the result that his definitions regarding the patterns of the vertebral
centra fail to be strictly applicable throughout the groups in question.
