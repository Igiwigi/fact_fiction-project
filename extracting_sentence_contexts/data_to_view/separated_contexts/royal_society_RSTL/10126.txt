So far as we can 8ee there is no reason why the Crustacea might not have originated
in this way, by the gradual integration and differentiation of a community of inde-
pendent metameres, but the evidence which is attainable seems to directly oppose the
belief that this has actually happened. We are able to trace the higher Decapods
back, very satisfactorily, to a Phyllopod-like ancestor with a long series of undif-
ferentiated somites and appendages, but even here the somites are simply parts of
the body, and they furnish no more evidence than those of a Crab to show that they
ever were the independent organisms of a community. When we attempt to go still further back we find that the facts of embryology, if
they show any thing whatever about the phyllogeny of the Crustacea, lead us back to a
Nauplius with three inter-dependent somites and three pairs of specialised appendages,
rather than to a form with a great number of unspecialiszed 8omites and similar
appendages. Turning now to a somewhat different aspect of the 8uhject, we notice that, if we
confine ourselves to structure, and leave out of sight the question of origin, there is
the closest similavity between serial homology and the homology between the corre-


-

sponding organs of allied animals which OwEx has proposed to distinguish by the
term ©special homology.” The structural relation between one appendage of Lucifer, say the first pereiopod,
and another, such as the swimmeret, is identical with the relation between the pereio-
pod of Zneifer and that of Squilla, or a Crab or Lobster.
