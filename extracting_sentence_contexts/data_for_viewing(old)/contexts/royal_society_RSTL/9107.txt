complicated generative glands, ducts, and pouches present the greatest diversity of
arrangement, 80 as to enable us to establish a series of strongly marked genera,
which, while differing in the arrangement of these parts, yet present but slight
differences in external form, or in the arrangement of their setz. Professor
Edmond Perrier, availing himseclf of the very fine collection of exotic Lumbricide
in the Jardin des Plantes, has heen the pioneer in this branch of investigation, and
in his memoir © Recherches pour servir a Phistoire des Lombriciens terrestres,”
published in the © Nouvelles Archives du Mus6um CA'Histoire Naturelle, 1872,” he
has established a series of genera on the only possible characters in modern-zoology—
namely those derived from thorough anatomical examination. M. Perrier has
studied earthworms from North and South Africa, from the East Indies, from the
West Indies, from North and South America, and a number of scattered islands, and
has rendered it evident that he has tapped a rich storehouse of zoological facts of
first-rate importance. Presenting, as they do, a considerable number of genera, and
occurring as they do almost universally on the earth's surface where there is
vegetable 80il—being moreoyer absolutely destitute either of means of transport or
of power to resist deleterious agents whilst being passively transported (earthworms
and probably their eggs are rapidly killed by sea-water), the Zumbricide promise to
yield, when fully investigated, a mass of information bearing upon the problems of
the causes of geographical distribution and the connections of continents and islands
in past epochs—more decisive and indisputable in its character than that presented
by any similar small group of the animal kingdom. The essential feature of their
organisation which gives to the Zambricide 80 interesting and important a position,
is the possession of a most sensitiye generative apparatus—sensitive, that is to ay, in
the sense of responding by innumerable modifications of its highly-developed male
