Height-gain considerations
It is natural to suppose that the use of a height-gain function is valid under certain con-
ditions in the mixed-path problem. A numerical example now to be given shows that this is
indeed the case, the procedure being to link the ground-to-ground field with that of ray
theory. An overall check on the analysis is thus obtained which is particularly reassuring in
view of the fact that no simple mathematical relation between (147) and (160), (161)
appears on the surface. RADIO PROPAGATION ACROSS A BOUNDARY Bit

To make the calculation feasible we must maintain the condition 7 }-4) — 7; this is no
real restriction, for it simply means that height variations must apply to both the transmitter
and the receiver, which is in any case necessary in order to introduce the height-gain
function in a form explicitly related to the two media in question. Our object is most
conveniently achieved by taking x — xy, ¥ = Yo — A

Let us first apply the idea to a homogeneous earth.
