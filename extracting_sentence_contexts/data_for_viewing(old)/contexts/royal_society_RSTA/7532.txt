product with the surface element. In an infinite medium free from applied stresses the force
which one group of singularities exerts on a second group is equal and opposite to the force
which the second exerts on the first. More generally action and reaction are equal and
opposite in the following sense: the total force on the singularities in I (figure 2c) plus the
total force on the singularities in IT is equal to the total force on all the singularities within Yo,
the integrals over the partition & cancelling.

The force which one infinite straight dislocation exerts on another parallel to it can be
found from (24) with 4; equal to the Burgers vector of one dislocation and ff equal to the
stress produced by the other. For a pair of edge dislocations the results agree with those of
Leibfried (1949) and Bilby (1950) but not with the original calculations of Koehler (1941).
If Koehlerâ€™s calculation is repeated in bipolar co-ordinates the result agrees with Leibfried,
Bilby and the present paper. The error appears to arise from the fact that Koehler had to split
the total energy into self-energy and interaction terms which are difficult to evaluate over
the same area. It is easy, for example, to evaluate the former over a circle and the latter over
a rectangle. When we let these two areas of integration tend to infinity the result obtained
depends on their relative size and shape. Instead of neglecting the energy within small
cylinders surrounding the dislocation lines we may cut out these cylinders leaving stress-free
holes at the centres of the dislocations, in the manner of Volterra. This problem can be solved
rigorously by an extension of the analysis of Dean & Wilson (1947). The result differs from
that obtained from (24) by terms which vanish with vanishing radius of the stress-free
cylinders. The additional terms represent the image force on one dislocation due to the hole
at the other.
