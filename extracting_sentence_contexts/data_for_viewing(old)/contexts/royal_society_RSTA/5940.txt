which minimizes the inequality, so an interesting non-trivial relation exists between 4 and p in
this case. In figure 2b, we represent the Gini index as a function of 4. We start with p = 1, which
represents the case of a universal assignment, where everybody receives the same share of the
collected amount of taxes. The bottom line corresponds to an optimal value of p, that we call
p =p" (A) (optimal targeted case, that is a function of 4). In this case, there is a minimum of the Gini
index for 4 ~ 0.28 when the regulatory mechanism of helping just a fraction of the population is
more efficient to reduce inequality. Remarkably, from lambda around 0.1 (10% of tax rate) and
below, the Gini index increases abruptly, independently of the targeted population. The results
shown in figure 2 are similar to those obtained in [26] (with random values of the risk factors),
although numerically different.

Keeping the constraint of wealth conservation, economic mobility is only possible through
exchanges. Owing to this fact, a good indicator of social mobility is the averaged wealth
