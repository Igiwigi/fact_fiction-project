to the next is about ‘0036 millim., or, roughly calculated, about twenty-seven
of them are present in one-tenth of a millimetre. K6rnriker described, in 1864,
the striped appearance of the fibres in the transverse section of an Astrea, which he
figured (vide antea, Introd., p. 87), and since that time most authors have referred
to a “lamellar” appearance of the so-called “ Ausfiillungsmasse” or stereoplasm,
without making a closer investigation of the subject.

The “cross-lines” seen in transverse section represent actual lamella. This is
proved by the fact that the fibres are crossed by similar wavy lines in sections cut
longitudinally. Tangential longitudinal sections show them best, in radial longitudinal
