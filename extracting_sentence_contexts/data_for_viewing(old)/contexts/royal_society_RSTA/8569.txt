Now the throw of the Richardson effect, which is in the opposite direction to the
spin of the electrons after magnetisation, represents a portion of the reaction to this
spin ; and there was nothing inherently impossible in the idea that another portion might
pass through a stage of spinning motion in some part or parts of the magnetic molecules
before being transmitted to the rigid structure of the iron in the form of the couple
which produces throw.

Thus, if for some reason half the reaction appeared at once as such a couple on
reversing the magnetism, and the remainder only after the dying down of an intermediate
spin stage, we should expect to find the Ratio tending towards 0-5 when Â¢ was increased
without limit, much as it does in Table III.

Further, the fact that Curves 1 are straight lines passing through the origin implies
that the difference between the momentum ordinates for any two of these lines, measured
at, the same value of the magnetic moment M, is proportional to M ; and this proportion
might also be expected on the above hypothesis.

It looked, in fact, as though we might have found in this way the explanation of the
low value of the Ratio, until the application of the two following tests. The first depends
on the fact that an increase of the moment of inertia of the suspended system decreases
the relative importance of the initial impulse in producing throw, and should therefore
increase the Ratio on the above view. After C in Table III., and before the fibre broke,
we attached a small wire leop to the bottom of the specimen (D, Table IV.). This
increased its moment of inertia from 1-4 10-' to 7-9 10-', but instead of increasing
the Ratio it reduced it from 0-535 to 0-515.
