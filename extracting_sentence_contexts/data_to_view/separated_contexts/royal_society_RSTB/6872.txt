Although
isolated terminal regions with as many as fourteen new leaves have been obtained, no
lateral buds have been observed in them. On the other hand, bud development in the
lateral segments has been extensive (§ 5 (a)).

(b) Supply of nutrients to the apical meristem

It is perhaps not sufficiently realized that, as the apical meristem is the region of the
shoot most remote from the sources of nutrients, special problems of translocation are
involved in its maintenance. How, in fact, is the developing meristem maintained in an
actively growing condition? There is support for the view that the extent of development
of the leaf primordia is largely dependent on the nutritional status of the growing region
(Wardlaw 1945c), and this will ultimately depend on supplies proceeding from below. Goebel (1900, 1908) considers that the primary leaves of the fern sporophyte are strictly
comparable in structure with the adult leaves but that their development has been arrested
in relation to limiting supplies of nutrients.
