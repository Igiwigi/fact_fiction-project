Bub it will
be observed that the equations, UQ'—UP=0, are lineo-linear in the U coordinates

and in the TU” coordinates; and as we are concerned with the ratios only of the
coefficients and not with their absolute values, we are in fact concerned only with the
ratios of the U coordinates inter 8, and of the U” coordinates inter 8e, and not with
their absolute values. Hence the number of independent coordinates will be reduced
to 48—34—2=12, as it should be,
