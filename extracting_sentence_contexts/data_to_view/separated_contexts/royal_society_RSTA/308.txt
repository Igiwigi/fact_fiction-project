Broadly
speaking, the results explain the wide variability of y noted in previous studies of geophysical
problems involving turbulent mixing. Engineering and geophysical problems involving turbulent mixing—ranging from the spread
of pollutants and hazardous plumes to combustion to the effect of anthropogenic tracers in
climate change—are typically very complex and it has been difficult to derive rigorous results for
these complex problems. On the other hand, rigorous results can, in fact, be attained for simple
models of the complex phenomena. If these models are good enough to capture qualitatively
the basic ingredients of laboratory experiments and real phenomena, it is conceivable that
one may better understand the underlying physical content of the observed complexity. This
content could include such features as transitions between Gaussian and stretched-tail probability
density functions for the passive scalar, the nature of the steady-state turbulent spectrum for
scalar variance and the eddy diffusivity approximations for tracers.
