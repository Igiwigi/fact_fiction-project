corpuscles are morphologically distinct from the white corpuscles. The former are of intravascular
origin, the latter are extravascular at first, but migrate into the blood system.

by one of us in earlier papers,* but we are able to add a further archaic character
the cell to those given there. In the earlier papers, the specific granulation
justly described as rose-reacting, further investigation has revealed the fact that
rose-reacting substance of Daphnia is also amphophile. In other words, even in
specific granulation the wandering cell of Daphnia is archaic, it is a rose-reacti
amphophile granulation. "We may even pursue the search for the cell element of
undifferentiated sporadic mesoblast a stage further back to the wandering cell of
larval Daphnia, while still within the broad pouch of the mother. Then we find an
amceboid cell with no granules, but the whole cell substance reacts with aniline d
