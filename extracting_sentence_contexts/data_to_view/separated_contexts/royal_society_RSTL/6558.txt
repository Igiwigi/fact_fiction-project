However this may be, the foregoing experiment enables us to draw some
important inferences. Storms at great heights must be greatly facilitated by the mobility of the particles of
the air. In fact storms are cases of convection on a large scale, and in our front cham-
ber we had one in miniature, With the same difference of temperature on the summit
of Mont Blanc, the motion of convection would be very nearly twice as great as at the
sea-level. In the swmmer of 1859 I was fortunate enough to induce my friend Professor
FRANKLAND to accompany me to the 8ummit of Mont Blanc, and to determine the com-

parative rates of combustion there and in the yalley of Chamouni. Six candles were
