However, in spite of numerous studies conducted on this subject
during the last decades, the mechanism responsible for IGSCC of alloy 600 in PWR environment
is still discussed [20]. Until very recently, a possible role of hydrogen in IGSCC occurring in
primary water at 300-350°C was discarded as this temperature range was considered to be too
high to provide hydrogen embrittlement effects. Indeed, according to current values proposed
for H-defects binding energies (about 0.2-0.8 eV), and besides the fact that detrapping energies
