Here, L is the wavelength in the canonical domain. We have used the Cauchy—Riemann relations
and the fact that

Xp =1-C[Y¢]. (3.11)


The integral (Hilbert-like) operator C[-]:= Ffi coth(kjD)]F;[-] acts on the function’s respective
harmonic conjugate [2]. The boundary value of the velocity potential’s harmonic conjugate w is

Through the relation ge = We it follows that along the (canonical) free surface ikF,[®] =
