had produced embryos.

No. 2. p.M. 5.—Sixty-three ova from the same female were well bathed with im-
pregnating fluid, and water was then added to them. The fluid in this case had been
obtained three quarters of an hour. Segmentation took place in the majority of these
at the end of five hours and a half.

No. 3. March 23, v.M. 12% 45®,—One hundred and twenty;four ova from the same
female, twenty-four hours after section of the spinal cord, were passed into water,
and impregnating fluid s0on after it. was obtained supplied to them. The ova were
placed in a temperature of about 60?, and nearly the whole produced embryos.

These facts proved that the ova employed were till fitted to become impregnated
when the fluid was supplied to them in $ufficient abundance, and for a sufficient length
of time, and within the period during which the envelope continues to expand and im-
bibe most rapidly. This condition is always promoted by an early removal from a
low to a comparatively high temperature during the period of expansion, as in Set G,
in which segmentation took place in from, five hours and @ half to 8ix hours, and when

not occur, in the only experiment in which it happened in Set F, No. 1, until the end
