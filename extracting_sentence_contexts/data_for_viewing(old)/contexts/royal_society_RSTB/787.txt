walls of the hyphe, or of their forming a dense pseudo-parenchyma. The phenomenon
appears to us to be an end or involution phase, rather than a transition phase. We
are aware that, amongst the fungi, more than one sclerotioid process is described ; but
whether anything analogous to the above occurs we are unable, from want of expe-
rience, to state. It appears, however, to be a fact that parasitic sclerotia do occur,
in which remains of the tissue of the plant host may be seen. Dr BAry* mentions
that Corvat points this out in the case of Peziza sclerotiorum, but we have not
been able to find where he makes the statement in his atlas. Dr Bary himself
figures Sclerotinia Fuckeliana, containing the cell débris of its vine-leaf host. In
many respects the black masses behave like the sclerotia. Thus, if the sclerotium of
of Cluviceps purpurea is boiled for a short time in caustic potash, and then placed in
water, there is the same streaming out of dark brown colouring matter. Both are
readily cleared by Eau de Javelle. Nitric, hydrochloric, and sulphuric acids cause
reddening of the black particles; the same effect is produced, not only upon the
sclerotium of Claviceps, but also upon those of Nectria, Peziza sclerotiorum, and
Rhizomorpha. As none of these are, however, delicate reactions, we lay no stress
upon them. The black particles are very resistant to strong reagents ; thus, as has
