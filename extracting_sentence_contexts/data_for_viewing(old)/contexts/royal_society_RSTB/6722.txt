(1) The leuco-anthocyanins are morphologically much more widespread than the
normal anthocyanins; for example, they occur in wood, bark and nutshells as well
as in flowers, leaves and fruits.

(2) In certain cases where both normal and leuco-anthocyanins are present in
the same part of a plant, the normal anthocyanin is not derived from the same
anthocyanidin as the leuco-anthocyanin.

(3) Certain leuco-anthocyanin types, for example, peltogynol (Robinson and
Robinson 1935), have no counterpart in the anthocyanins,

In this latter respect they resemble the flavones and flavonols, and it is perhaps
worth while to draw attention once again to the fact that quercetin (3 : 4â€™-dihydroxy-
benzene nucleus) is the most frequently encountered anthoxanthin.* The antho-
cyanidins obtained from leuco-anthocyanins in the species examined (Robinson and
Robinson 1933, 1934) were as follows:

Pelargonidin in 2 spp.

Cyanidin in 42 spp.

Petunidin in 1 sp.

Delphinidin in 5 spp.
Thus the cyanidin orientation occurs with a frequency of 84%. In addition, pelto-
