of Rana and Bufo as the general structure of the trunk vertebra, for we cannot otherwise
explain why they described the formation of the trunk vertebra almost in the same way
as that of the anterior portion of the urostyle. There is no separate ventral cartilage,
such as they assumed to represent the united pair of heemal arch elements.

In the case of Bombinator igneus, the perichordal tube chondrifies first beneath the
bases of the dorsal arcualia, and then mid-dorsally, but the ventral portion, instead of
chondrifying, degenerates along with the notochord. According to EMELIANOFrF (1925),
Pelobates fuscus follows the same sort of development of the vertebral centrum of the
trunk vertebra. Gorrre (1875) is the first worker who noticed a difference between
the cellular structure of the cartilaginous semi-ring dorsally to the notochord, and
the cells of the overlying cartilaginous dorsal arcualia. But he failed to detect the
two layers of the sheath of the notochord, and tried to reconcile this fact by saying
that this perichordal tube was the outer layer. As almost all the workers in this
line found these two layers quite distinct, and as the outer layer is not cartilaginous,
nobody took any notice of the statement of Gorrre, and especially as no one has worked
on this particular species since his time.

Xenopus levis is a unique and most interesting case. The chondrification of the
perichordal tube starts just as in the other cases first beneath the basidorsals and then
mid-dorsally. As already stated, Xenopus has a rectangular cartilaginous structure
ventral to the notochord which RrpEwoop (1897) thought might be homologous with
the hypochordal cartilage of Bombinator described by Gorrre in the urostyle region.
RipEwoop emphasised this since nobody previously had described a hypochordal
