fast and steep phenomena, compatible with the second law formulated on the grounds of the
extended entropy and the extended entropy flux. The motivations of the theory are especially
clear if one begins with the third point we have mentioned: the practical need for formulating
generalized transport equations for small systems and for fast processes is especially compelling
at a time of interest in miniaturization of devices and of fast operation. Computers could be
a good example of this: they are based on miniaturized, fast devices, dissipating much heat;
thus, heat, speed and miniaturization appear in an intimate combination, asking for conceptual
thermodynamic grounds to explore their attainable limits.

From the three basic ideas mentioned in the first paragraph, the several developments
of extended thermodynamics may differ in: (a) the concrete fluxes taken into account;
(b) the techniques being used in the exploitation of the second law; (c) the connections with the
microscopic level of description; (d) the range of systems being analysed. In fact, the bibliography
related to extended thermodynamics is considerably wide: it includes at least 18 monographs
[1-18] and 17 review papers [18-35] but the diversity of approaches makes it difficult to give
them a wide well-recognizable form beyond their mutual differences. The aim of this paper is to
foster the contact between them.

Let us note that the central role given to the fluxes in extended thermodynamics, in contrast
to local-equilibrium versions of non-equilibrium thermodynamics (in which the fluxes are
determined by the gradients of the thermodynamic conjugates of the classical equilibrium
variables) fits especially well to the spirit of our globalization epoch. Indeed, the fluxes are
nowadays central concepts of our society: fluxes of capital, of matter (fuel, goods), of information
and of people (migrations, tourism). In fact, they have become some of the critical parameters
for the stability of our model of civilization. Thus, the application of ideas from physics to social
