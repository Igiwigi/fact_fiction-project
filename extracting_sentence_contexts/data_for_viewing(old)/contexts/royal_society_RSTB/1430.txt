nains to consider the secondary tissues external to the wood. In the more
specimens (see Plate 84, fig. 48) the thick cortical zonet is composed of
anged cells. Their radial series correspond with, but are usually more
1s than, those of the wood. The walls of the cortical cells become thicker

In favourable cases, however, where the delicate phloém happens to be
jarly well preserved, or where, perhaps, it was developed in unusual amount,
s structure is clear. This is the case, for example, in the largest specimen,

Adjoining the wood we see evident remains of the tabular cambial cells.
these we find a group of thin-walled tissue, in which the arrangement of the
