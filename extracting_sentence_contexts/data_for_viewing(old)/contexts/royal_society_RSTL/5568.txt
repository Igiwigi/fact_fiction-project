involve a, and throwing out the constant factor &*, we obtain

(X2+Y?)(X2—1—FY— 4/Y*=0,
or

X(X?—1—PY+Y(X+1+hX—1—b)(X+1—b(X—1-F#)=0,

which agrees with the former result

XL.

It was remarked that the ordinary construction for the secondary caustic could not
be applied to the case of parallel rays (the entire curve would in fact pass off to an
infinite distance), and that the simplest conurse was to measure the distance GQ from a
line through the centre of the refracting circle perpendicular to the direction of the
rays. To find the equation of the resulting curve, take the centre of the circle as the
origin and the direction of the incident rays for the axis of z; let the radius of the circle
be taken equal to unity, and let p denote, as before, the index of refraction. Then if «, B
are the coordinates of the point of incidence of a ray, we have «*+8*=1, and consider-
ing «, 3 as variable parameters connected by this equation, the required curve is the
envelope of the circle,

wile—eY+(y—BY} —&*=0.
Write now 4= cos 0, 3= in 0, then multiplying the equation by —2, and writing
1+ cos 20 instead of 2 cos? 0, the equation becomes
