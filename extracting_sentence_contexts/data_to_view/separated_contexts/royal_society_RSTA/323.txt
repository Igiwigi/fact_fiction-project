To illustrate this, [Ss
consider a toy example involving two binary variables a and b, and a function given simply by :
the product ab. If we sum this function over all values of a and b, we obtain

YoYo ab =ayby + ayby + ayby + arb. (5.4)
a ob

We see that evaluation of the right-hand side requires seven operations (four multiplications and
three additions). However, we can exploit the fact that the function ab factorizes into the product
of a function of a and a function of b to enable us to rewrite (5.4) in the analytically equivalent form

Yo Vo ab = (ay +a2)(b1 + bp), (5.5)
a ob

which now only requires three computational steps (two additions and one multiplication). We
have exploited the factorization structure to exchange summation and multiplication and thereby
achieve a form that is analytically equivalent but computationally more efficient. Now consider a more complex example consisting of a chain of nodes, as shown in figure 8.
