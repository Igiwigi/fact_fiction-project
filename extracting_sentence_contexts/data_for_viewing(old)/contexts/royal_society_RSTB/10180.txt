low food quality at the individual level might have been
balanced by a decrease in population growth, resulting in
no observable effects of food quality on grazing at the popu-
lation level in the experiment at 24°C. In the model, we
observed an even stronger decrease of consumer growth with
increasing C : N ratios for Euplotes at 24°C, resulting in decreas-
ing population grazing rates, ie. the decrease in population
growth was stronger than compensatory feeding at the
individual level [21].

Neither nutrient conditions nor temperature significantly
affected grazing rates of Brachionus in the experiment. This
might be due to the fact that the smaller consumer Euplotes
reproduced much faster, exhibiting much higher popula-
tion grazing rates compared with Brachionus, for which
compensatory feeding activity was low in the time frame of
this experiment.

(ii) Consumer biovolume

Consumer growth rates and final consumer biovolume
increased with temperature for all consumer combinations,
corroborating hypothesis H2 and also predicted by the
metabolic model. Based on MTE [16], consumer growth
rates are expected to increase with temperature, which
