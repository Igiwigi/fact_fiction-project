It
can also be proved by statistical analysis of all 209 selected intervals (figure 14), which presents
the distributions of g (figure 14a) and gr (figure 14b). The mean values of these parameters for the
distributions shown in figure 14 are (g) = 2.4 and ( (Sf) = 2.8. This fact is in a good agreement with
the ‘flux tubes’ approach to the SW structure [69,70]. Apparently, filamentary structures are the
most stable and, therefore, could dominate in the dynamics of SW turbulence.
