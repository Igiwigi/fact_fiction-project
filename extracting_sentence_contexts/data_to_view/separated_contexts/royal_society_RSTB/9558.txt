As the group expands, the leader
are fixed. For convenience, we define the net cost (C) to an becomes merely one among many, so her direct contribution
actor as: C=c—b/n, where c is the cost of cooperative to R is negligible compared to the associations she produces
action (as explained above) while b/n is the private benefit among her followers. Here, R reduces to just p2—the relation-
the actor gets back from his or her own action regardless of ship between any two followers created by the fact that they
what others do. Under these assumptions, the cooperative both copied the leader. If followers copy their leader 50% of
behaviour (x = 1) will spread to fixation (q > 1) and remain the time, R = 0.25—analogous to a group of half-brothers.
