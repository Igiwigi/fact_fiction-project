ture [95], the dental development in Australopithecus has been
likened to that in chimpanzees, suggesting a faster life history
than in humans. However, based on a comparison of the
Dikika child, a 3-year old Australopithecus afarensis, to adult fos-
sils, it has been suggested that despite their ape-like endocranial
volumes, members of this species took a longer time to attain
the adult brain volume than African apes. This would make
the pattern of brain growth in A. afarensis more ‘human-like’
[96]. This protracted pattern of brain development might indi-
cate a longer period of early brain plasticity and an increased
period of time during which the offspring remains dependent
on parental care. However, to date this remains contentious,
in particular due to the fact that the range of interspecific
variability within apes is still poorly documented.

4. Homo erectus

The emergence of forms assigned to the genus Homo, in particu-
lar of early representatives of H. erectus approximately 1.9 Ma,
has long been considered a decisive step in the emergence of
several human features fully expressed in recent H. sapiens.
These include large body size, human-like body proportions
with long legs and reduced abdomen, large brain, high-quality
diet including increased carnivory, increased tool-kit complex-
ity and advanced social organization emphasizing food
