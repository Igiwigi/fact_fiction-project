The small inactivation of
carboxypeptidase brought about by exposure to «-rays could be ascribed to the secondary electrons
(é-rays) which travel clear of the a-ray track and it is not certain that any inactivation of enzyme
is brought about by the primary @-ray ionization. INTRODUCTION

When carboxypeptidase in dilute aqueous solution is exposed to X-radiation, the specific
hydrolyzing power of the enzyme towards substrates such as a peptic digest of edestin or
chloracetyltyrosine is reduced. At a given enzyme concentration the residual activity is
an exponential function of the dose and the fact that over a wide range of enzyme concen-
trations the exponent is inversely proportional to concentration has been interpreted as
indicating that the enzyme molecules are not directly affected by the ionizing radiation but
indirectly through collision with a labile product, resulting from the ionization of the water. This interpretation receives support from various other circumstances of the inactivation
(Dale 1940, 1942, 1943; Dale, Meredith & Tweedie 1943). The precise nature of the
change in the enzyme molecule responsible for the loss of activity is unknown, and, although
it has been plausibly suggested (Weiss 1944) that the ionization of water leads directly to
the production of atomic hydrogen and hydroxyl radicals, it has not so far been demon-
strated experimentally that these radicals play a part in this particular reaction.
