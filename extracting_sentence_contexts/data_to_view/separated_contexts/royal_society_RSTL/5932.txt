It is needless to remark that Jacos1's transformation does not enable us to reduce

2 the integral of the circular form. 'The difficulty which we here encounter, is exactly
S analogous to that which presents itself in the reduction of the cubic equation of ordinary
S algebra. In fact, if we were to apply Jacos1's transformation to one only of & or ©, the
© auxiliary arcs just mentioned would give values of » of the form q+1'\/ —1), and the
= difficulty would depend upon the interpretation of F(y+a'x/ —1). 5 * See Fonctions Elliptiques, vol. i. p. 71. ect.
