This purpose was to a great extent
achieved, and it must be concluded that the behaviour of elephants in such a locality is
little or no guide to their natural behaviour when undisturbed. The writer is inclined to attribute much of the confusion which exists with regard to the
breeding and migratory habits of the African elephant to three causes. In the first place,
they are very difficult animals to observe over a period of time in their natural habitat, for
even when the nature of the vegetation allows of their being seen from some distance, they
cover such distances in their diurnal, and particularly nocturnal, wanderings, that it is
impossible to maintain contact with them for long, and a group will split up and rejoin and
mingle with other groups, so that it is impossible to define a ‘herd’. ‘This term, in fact, is
very loosely used, and at present it cannot be said that we know anything of the social
structure of an elephant ‘herd’. The term is perhaps best confined to a geographical
connotation, as it is used by Pitman (1925). In the second place, it is difficult to determine
the sex of an elephant by casual observation, except when the tusks are really large.
