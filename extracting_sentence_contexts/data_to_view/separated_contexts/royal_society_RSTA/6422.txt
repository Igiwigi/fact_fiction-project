Each quantum measurement is unique, and non-commutativity of QM reflects
this uniqueness, including in the case of two reversed complementary measurements, which
give us different outcomes, in contrast to classical physics. There these outcomes are the same,
because, neglecting, as one can, the interference of observational instruments, both variables
can be determined jointly at any moment in time. Even if one measures only one, the other is



definable, thus reflecting the fact that one decides to know one or the other aspect of the same
reality, which is not complementarity in Bohr’s sense. The future course of reality is classically
causally predetermined as well. There is no uncertainty relation or complementarity in Bohr’s
sense.
