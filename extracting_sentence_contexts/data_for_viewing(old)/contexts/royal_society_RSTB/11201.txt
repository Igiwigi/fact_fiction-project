endogenous HSP and NF-«B, the promotion of the HSP
response by stress-inducing agents results in reducing the
NF-«B transcription activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines
such as TNF-a. HSP70 was one of the first molecules found
to inhibit NF-«B [5]. In addition, transcription factors involved
with HSP regulation such as heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) can also
exert a direct negative effect on the TNF-a gene promoter [6],
which leads to the inhibition of TNF-a production.

2. Regulatory T cells and maintenance of
self-tolerance

Despite the fact that many self-antigens simply remain ignored
by the immune system, tolerance for self is mainly an actively
acquired physiological state, based on various mechanisms.
Such mechanisms include the deletion of T cells from the
thymus, deletion of B cells from the bone marrow and the lym-
phoid germinal centres, and functional silencing of T and B
cells, known as anergy. More recently, additional critical mech-
anisms have surfaced, such as immuno-regulatory processes
mediated through specialized regulatory cells. Despite the
existence of these multiple mechanisms, self-reactive B and T
cells are produced and are sometimes activated, giving rise to
autoimmune diseases. However, as it seems now, self-reactive
T cells may also constitute a major segment of the healthy
