Sc. and Math.,’ vol. 26, p. 722 (1926). This note contains the sentence, “‘ By the
use of this powder [ was able to obtain discs that extended completely across the tube,” which from the
context can only mean that he made the ordinary ridges extend right across the tube, which is easily done
with tubes somewhat narrower than those used by me. There is no mention of an antinodal position—in fact,
the above sentence is the sole mention of the dises—and it is doubtful if true antinodal discs can be obtained
with the unsteady conditions elicited with a stroked rod, which Mr. Coox used to excite the tube. In a letter
dated April 15, 1931 (i.e., over three weeks after my letter was published in ‘ Nature ’), published in the
* Physical Review,’ vol. 37, p. 1189 (1931), Mr. Cook gives a diagram closely resembling a photograph
published in my letter, and suggests that the ridges are due, as stated in my letter, to air vortices, without
making any reference to my publication.
