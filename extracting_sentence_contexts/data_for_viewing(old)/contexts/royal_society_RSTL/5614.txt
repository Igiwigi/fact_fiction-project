is required in the investigation, the periodical laws of the disturbances have hitherto
been made out at no other observatories than those of the British Colonies. I gladly
avail myself therefore of the opportunity of showing, that when the disturbances, occurring
at Hobarton during eight years, are broken into four distinct and equal portions, each of
two years” duration, each s8uch portion manifests, under a suitable mode of investigation,
the same periodical law of diurnal variation, almost identical in the principal features of
direction and turning hours, and differing only in the magnitude of the variation in
different years, in which difference it conforms strictly to the decennial period as indi-
cated elsewhere, having a minimum in 1843—1844, and a maximum five years later.

As the existence of a lay of diurnal variation regulating the occurrence of the disturb-
ances of large amount rests hitherto, I believe, only on investigations made by myself, T
may be excused for here calling attention to the fact, that each of the four portions, into
which the disturbances at Hobarton have been divided, bears its testimony to the existence
of this law ;—which may be accounted a general one, since it has been found to prevail
at stations 80 widely distant from each other as Toronto, St. Helena, and Hobarton.

The following Table exhibits, for each of the two-yearly periods, the excess at the
several hours of mean solar time at the station, of the aggregate easterly differences from
the monthly normal at the same hour over the aggregate westerly differences (or westerly
over easterly as the case may be), divided by the number of days of observation in each
two-yearly period: it is therefore strictly a table of the mean diurnal variation due to the
disturbances that have been separated for the purpose of investigating the periodical laws
of this class of the phenomena.
