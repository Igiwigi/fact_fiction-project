The fine spinels, nearly an inch in diameter, are found with their surfaces showing
the incipient alteration to which I have referred. In these cases, it would seem that
the growth of the spinel crystals and their partial alteration by solvent action going
on irregularly over their surfaces, must both have been accomplished before the
deposition of the calcite in which they are now found to be completely embedded. In
the case of the Mogok limestones, however, the fact that the unaltered rubies are seen
ving in the midst of a mass of their alteration products, the whole being enclosed in
the limestone, seems to prove conclusively that the changes took place after the
ormation of the latter rock.—-October 7, 1895].

n VIlIl.—Summary ov Resvrrs.

6 The chief scientitic results to which we have been conducted by these studies, are
Bs follows :—

20 1, The famous rubies and spinels of Burma have now been found in situ in a highly
‘Grystalline limestone, containing various silicates and oxides, with pyrrhotite (magnetic
“Spyrites) and graphite.

5S 2. The equally famous rubellite (red tourmaline), so highly prized by the Chinese,
‘ghough found in the same district, does not occur in actual association with the
Sorundum and spinel in the limestones, but is found in certain acid rocks (aplites)
gissociated with the gneisses and schists.

> 8. The limestone containing rubies and spinels is very intimately associated with
Hertain highly basic foliated rocks :—pyroxene - gneisses and granulites, with
spyroxenites and amphibolites.
