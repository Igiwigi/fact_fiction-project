The fifth experiment, performed with this apparatus, at once gave a refractivity of
227, which is nearly identical with the best experiment of the 13th January.

+ A molecule of HF probably retards light less than a molecule of fluorine, but since the molecule of
this vapour, under normal conditions, is at least as complex as H,F,, its presence in an atmosphere of
fluorine would probably raise the refractivity of the mixture.


ON THE REFRACTIVE INDEX OF GASEOUS FLUORINE. 321

In all these trials a singular fact was observed. The index slowly decreased to a
minimum, and, after remaining steady for a few minutes, retrograded by several
points, indicating the presence of an increased proportion of some gas of higher
refractivity. This effect was observed in nearly every subsequent experiment
performed with the prism, and its significance will be referred to hereafter.

But, in spite of the concordance between the lowest values obtained on the first
and second days, these experiments could not, for several reasons, be regarded as
satisfactory. All previous estimates of the refractivity of fluorine, based on the
refraction equivalent, point to a much lower value than 227; and, though this
expression cannot be relied upon to give a very close approximation, its agreement
with the refractivity is usually fair, and there is no other instance of so wide a
discrepancy between the two as these figures would show.
