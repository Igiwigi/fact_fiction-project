stant-of aberration.

The parallax resulting for « Lyra does not materially differ
from my first determination: That of « Aquile is less than


330 Dr. BRINKLEY's observations for investigating

before. Had 204” been used for the” constant of aberration,
the result would have been only less by half a second- than
before.

In fact, the quantity of discordance does not- differ from
what I had before observed, but part of 'it now appears to
arise from the constant of aberration» being greater z'/a con=
clusion that will be deemed very important, should it be con-
firmed by future observations or other instruments. © The
parallax of Arcturus is 80mewhat less than before; and thatof
» Cygni considerably less. yy Draconis; as before, exhibits no
parallax; the small negative result. of -$ of a second may
safely be referred to the unavoidable errors of observation:
The new results agree with the former, in 'showing-that-the
Pole Star has no sensible parallax:

With respect to the constant'of aberration, it is almost un-
