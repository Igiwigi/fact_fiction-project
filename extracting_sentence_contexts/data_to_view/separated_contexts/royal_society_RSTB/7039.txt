But even in those specimens where the apical cell was punctured with minimal
disturbance, a considerable area of the meristem became necrosed (figures 62, 63, plate 27). It may accordingly be inferred that the system of stresses at the extreme apex is such that
a release of pressure in the apical cell has a marked effect on the neighbouring cells. The
superficial cells adjacent to the apical cell are, in fact, very susceptible to injury. In
numerous operations the writer has not found it possible to destroy the apical cell alone. On being perforated, some apical cells freely exuded a liquid which dried to a brown scab.
