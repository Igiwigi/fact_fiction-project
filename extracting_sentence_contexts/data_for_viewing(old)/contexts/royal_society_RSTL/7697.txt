tidean folds of mucous membrane, and was COT to the mucous membrane
hel apparently giving off no muscular branches.
t Ty an the ala of the thyroid cartilage an Accessory
glottideus muscle was exposed ; it was s0mewhat triangular in shape, and arose from
anterior and external angle of the arytenoid cartilage ; from this the fibres Passed 1
wards, diverging, and were inserted into the side of the fibrocartilaginous pedicle of
epiglottis, posterior to which its fibres coalesced with those of its fellow of the opposi
= thyroarytenoid muscle was united to the posterior border of that last described,
in fact both appeared to be but parts of one large muscular expansion; it arose from
the yertical median ridge on'the superior surface of the thyroid cartilage, where its fibres
were distinctly separate from the foregoing muscle ; it passed forwards and inwards, and
was inserted into the anterior and external margins of the arytenoid cartilage, and into
the contiguous margin of the cricoid. |

There were no vestiges of chord yocales or of a yentricle, or a lateral laryngeal 8ac-
culus; but situated in front of the cavity of the larynx, and opening by a wide orifice
immediately at the root of the epiglottis, there was a remarkable large musculo-membra-
nous mesial sac or laryngeal pouch, which extended downwards and backwards in front
of the trachea; its walls, which were thick, were almost entirely composed of circular
muscular fibres, which anteriorly or nearer the glottis took their origin from the upper
surface of the thyroid cartilage, and posteriorly formed a series of circles with no defi-
