On the other hand the intermediate vortices began to expand, to fill the
spaces from which the first set had contracted and to contract in the parts where the
first set had expanded. ‘The effect is represented in sketch, fig. 21. As seen in side elevation the effect was curious ; it looked as though each vortex was
pulsating so that its cross-section varied periodically, though with an oscillation of
increasing amplitude. After a time it became impossible to follow the motion, owing
partly, no doubt, to the fact that the system adopted for marking the liquid was not
really suitable for observing any but symmetrical motions. When experiments were tried with slightly greater values of — it was found that
the breakdown occurred in a very similar manner, but that in this case each vortex
seemed to expand in several points, equally spaced, round the cylinder. The appearance
of the colouring matter was then similar to that shown in the sketch, fig. 22.
