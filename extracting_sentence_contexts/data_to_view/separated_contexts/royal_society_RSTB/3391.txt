Frequently the fusion-nucleus undergoes an immediate mitosis (figs. 33%, 350, 36). Whether it occurs at once or is delayed for a time, the number of chromosomes
is very large and not the same in different nucleiâ€”a fact which is no doubt due to
the unequal numbers of constituents taking part in the fusion. In this division the
new cell-wall is laid down in a cell plate in the usual manner (fig. 36). As a result
of these cell divisions, the lower part of the sac enlarges, passing through the stages
outlined in figs. 89, F-H. This primary growth, which occurs before fertilisation,
ceases at about the stage of 89H. A more considerable secondary growth commences
after fertilisation.
