means constant bodies ; they are arranged in two rows, which together constitute the
sorus, and this is perhaps their most constant feature. In point of segmentation of
the cells which give rise to them, there is very great diversity of detail, though it
appears that, as in other Pteridophyta, the essential part of the sporangia is referable
in origin to superficial cells. But beyond this, in form and size of the sporangium, in
the number of sporogenous cells, in the details of septation, and even in the details of
dehiscence, there is an absence of constancy. Though many of the characters provide
material for speculation, which will be taken up later, one conclusion may at least be

drawn from the facts (it is, indeed, a mere summary of them), viz., that the sorus and
sporangium of Dana are distinctly non-specialised, perhaps more obviously non-
specialised than those of any other living Pteridophyte.

Summary of Data from Study of Danza.

(t.) The sori consist of numerous sporangia, arranged in two parallel rows, united
into an oblong cake-like mass, partially overarched by indusia, which spring up
between the sori, from the surface of the leaf.

(2.) The sori are not always strictly circumscribed, but are liable to abstriction,
resulting in shorter, sometimes circular, sori.
