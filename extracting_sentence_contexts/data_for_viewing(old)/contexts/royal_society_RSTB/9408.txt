Figure 1. The effect of survivorship curves (plots of age x versus In(/,)) on the likelihood that a death during age x is caused by cancer rather than some other
mortality source, c,. Figure 1@ shows the three survivorship curves for the beaver model, where the Type Il survivorship curve (relatively constant death rate with
age) is our baseline model. The Type | (increasing death rate with age) and Type Ill curves (declining death rate with age) are modifications to the baseline where
the values of /, have been adjusted to keep life expectancy and net reproductive rates relatively constant. The Type Ill curve results in the highest optimal level of
cancer suppression, u* = 0.111, and the lowest lifetime likelihood of dying of cancer, C= 0.0184; while the Type | is opposite (u* = 0.100, C = 0.0239). As
shown in figure 16, this is despite the fact that the age-specific cause of death from cancer rises most steeply for the Type Ill curve and least for the Type I. This is
because with a Type Ill curve, the death rate from other causes declines with age, whereas the likelihood of dying from cancer always increases with age in our
model regardless of survivorship curve. The gyrations in figure 1b for Type II survivorship are because we have used actual published data for beaver survivorship that
has presumably stochastic variation in age-specific mortality from other causes with ageâ€”hence for age classes with unusually low death rates, a high proportion of
those deaths shall be from cancer.
