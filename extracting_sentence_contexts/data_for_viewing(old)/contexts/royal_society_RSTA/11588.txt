above and below the mode is given by the ratio of e,: e, or 0°191:0°225. At
Markree Castle, on the other hand, it requires more than half-an-inch to cover half
the frequency, z.e., from 296825 to 201845, and the ratio of 0°219 : 0°283 gives
the relative ranges of half the frequencies above and below the mode.

The comparatively small amount of labour necessary to determine Sk and o,—

in fact, Sk may, by the rule of the modal third be determined from the median and the
mean—and, thence, e,; and e, by the above formule, make this a very convenient,
as well as scientifically accurate, method of appreciating the range and the skewness
of the variability at any station.

Our discussion has now led us to the following general conclusions :—

(1.) The mode, the standard deviation, and the skewness fully define barometric
frequency. These three constants depend, in the first place, on geographical position,
and appear to be constant along certain lines—the generalised isobars.

(2.) A knowledge of these three constants enables us, by means of very simple
formule, to describe the chief physical features of the barometric frequency at any
