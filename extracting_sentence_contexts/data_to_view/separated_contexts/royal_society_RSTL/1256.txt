Vol. LXXX.), that be-
tween the several stations from High Nook to Botley Hill, the
mean refractions are very great. From the reciprocal observations at Leith Hill, Banstead,
and Shooter's Hill, the height of the last station is 446 feet,
which is the same, in fact, as that obtained in the following
manner. General Roy found by levelling, that the floor of
the upper story of the Bull Inn at Shooter's Hill was 444 feet
above the Gun Wharf at Woolwich ; and he allowed 22 feet
for the fall to low water at the sea ; the sum is 466 feet. In
1794, we levelled from the Inn to the Station, and found the
latter 21 feet lower than the floor, which taken from 466,
there remains 44, feet for the station's height.
