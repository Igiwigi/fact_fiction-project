Below
the transition temperature the only mechanism of growth would be a two-dimensional
nucleation, which we know (part III) is always a very slow process at low supersaturations. Above the transition temperature the growth will be proportional to the supersaturation. Actually the fact that real crystals are imperfect guarantees the presence of the steps required
to explain the observed growth at low supersaturations and below the transition temperature;
Frank (1949) has shown that, during growth, a dislocation or group of dislocations termi-
nating in the surface sends out closed loops of step in such a way that at any instant the
surface is covered by a very high density of steps, practically independently of the number of
dislocations present (provided there is at least one). Therefore, even if we observe the growth
of a surface for which the critical temperature is below the melting-point, there would hardly
be any difference between the rate of growth below and above the critical temperature.

20. Many-level model: Betheâ€™s approximation

The two-level model of a crystal surface is clearly an over-simplification.
