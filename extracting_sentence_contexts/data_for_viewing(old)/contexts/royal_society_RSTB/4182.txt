The stems of Williamsonia were occasionally branched but much stouter, and covered
with foliage-leaves in a manner very different from my specimens. I do not think that
at present any valuable comparison can be drawn as to the place of origin of the
peduncles. Passing over the leaves, whose cuticles have been already compared,t
and the scale-covered peduncles, we come to the flower. Here the presence of
numerous ensheathing bracts presents a point of difference, though the bracts in
W. scutica were morphologically similar to those here described.{ There seems to
be no trustworthy evidence that the flowers of Williamsonia were bisexual, and in
this we have an important point of difference. ;

The male flowers of Williamsonia were very much larger and had a much greater
pollen output than the present flower, a fact which may, perhaps, be correlated with
the unisexual nature of that plant. We may, following Prof. NarHorst,§ arrange
the male sporophylls in a series with the pinnate sporophylls of W. spectabilis at one
end, followed by the large synangiate form of Cycadocephalus, the smaller synangiate
types of Weltrichia and Williamsonia whitbiensis; the sporophylls of the present

d * We may notice that the outer epidermis of the “ Palisadenring ” was somewhat strongly cuticularised,
which points to its being composed of fused sporophylls rather than of fused sporangia, but apparently
stomata were absent, as would be expected in a structure so reduced.
