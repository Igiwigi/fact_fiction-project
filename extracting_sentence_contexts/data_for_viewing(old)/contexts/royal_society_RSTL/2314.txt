both the motor and sensitive influence ; the legs themselves are but little concerned
in the function of respiration, and consequently are but tightly supplied with neryes
from the superadded series. But the nerves to the wings, being already formed of
two roots, could hardly require an additional one, were it not for some especial
purpose, and did not each root confer a distinct endowment.

In addition to all that has yet been stated respecting the superadded nerves, there
is a curious fact relating to the terminal pair, which seems further to prove that they
are not simply nerves of motion. These nerves in the Sphinx, and all other insects,
and in Crustacea, [Plate XVII. fig. 40. (7)] are given, as before stated, to the rectum, in
addition to the terminal pair from the last great ganglion of the cords, and end in
the sphineter musecles. Now if these were simple motor nerves, we should expect that
they would be approximated to the terminal pair, which come directly from the last
great ganglion of the cords, instead of merely passing along parallel with them, and
ending separately, although in the same structures, viz. the sphincter and levator
muscles of the anus. But it may be said that this does not prove them to be other
than simple motor nerves, or that the nerves from the ganglion communicate both
sensation and motion. This objection is clearly answered, and the terminal nerves
from the last great ganglion of the cords are shown to communicate motion as well
as sensation, from their distribution in the male of the Wild Bee before noticed, An-
