THE FLOW OF AIR AROUND AN AEROFOIL OF INFINITE SPAN. 211

components round a contour near the aérofoil represents a rather greater fraction of
the total lift than the corresponding integral in a perfect fluid, since a reduction of
circulation indicates smaller velocities and smaller rate of transfer of momentum across
the contour. '

9. With regard to circulation in the rear of the aérofoil, it was found that the vorticity
was mainly confined to a comparatively narrow wake, but tended to diffuse fairly rapidly.
This was shown by the fact that there was quite distinct evidence of a certain amount of
circulation around a contour entirely above or entirely below the core of the wake
within certain limits, although a contour extending well above and below the wake, and
drawn so as to cut the wake at an angle not too far from 90°, would give zero circulation.
In this connection it is interesting to note that the experimental results bear out Prof.
Taytor’s argument* that a contour enclosing the aérofoil, but including unequal
amounts of the positive and negative vorticity in the wake, would not give the circu-
lation corresponding to the lift. The discrepancy is not usually appreciable unless the
contour cuts the wake at an angle very considerably less than 45°. or is deliberately
made to run along the core of the eddying wake for some little distance. A contour
of the latter type which included about 14 chords length of the core gave a circulation
10 per cent. less than that corresponding to the lift.
