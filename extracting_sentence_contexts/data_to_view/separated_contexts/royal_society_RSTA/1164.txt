Although it is often assumed that they are water-rich, their composition is poorly
constrained as discussed in Helled et al. [13,63]. Also, since they are not H-He dominated, the
chosen materials and their distribution significantly affects the inferred composition. Planets in
this mass regime are in fact most sensitive to the assumed planetary internal structure and the
equation of state (EOS) used by the modeller (e.g. Baraffe et al. [64], Vazan et al. [65]). Planet formation models suggest that deep interiors of gaseous planets are expected to consist
of composition gradients, although this is just started to be included in current structure models.
