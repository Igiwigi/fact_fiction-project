Single-ended electroretinograms were recorded with subcorneal
metal microelectrodes (12-15 mQ, FHC, Inc.), and amplified
with an FHC model XCell-3 microelectrode amplifier, used
with a high impedance probe to eliminate electrode polarization
artefacts [29]. The seawater bath was grounded with an AgCl-
coated wire. Light from an Ocean Optics regulated white light

living juveniles within a species might have greater temporal
resolution, as they can afford to sacrifice sensitivity in these
more brightly lit waters in order to maintain good temporal
resolution. In addition, the fact that juveniles live at warmer
temperatures than the deep-living adults could have a signifi-
cant effect on their temporal-resolving power, as increases in

temperature have been shown to significantly increase the supply, filtered with a 490 nm filter, was transmitted to the eye
