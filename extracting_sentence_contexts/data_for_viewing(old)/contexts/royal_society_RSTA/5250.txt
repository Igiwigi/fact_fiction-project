However, since the structurally similar carotenoid compounds often produce similar Raman
spectra, which generally differ only in small Raman shifts of key bands, the identification and
confirmation of the specific carotenoid is quite difficult. The situation is further complicated by the
fact that natural samples typically contain a more-or-less complex mixture of carotenoids. Other
analytical methods, such as chromatography, allow for the separation of individual pigments in
the mixture and are favourable to use in conjunction with Raman spectroscopy to produce more
robust results.

Table 1 presents the positions of the characteristic carotenoid bands (electronic supplementary
material, Sla means sample 1 analysis 1, etc.) for each area that was analysed within one layer
or between different samples. The difference in the positions of these bands can be attributed to
the fact that there is usually a mixture of pigments in each layer, and that the layer boundaries
are continuous. Additionally, the position of the (C—CHs3) band at 1001-1013 cm"! is very close
to the position of the vj(SO4) band from the gypsum host rock at 1008 cm~!; therefore, at least in
some cases, the Raman signal of the band near 1000 cm™" is in part due to the presence of gypsum.
An indicator may be the intensity of the 6(C—CHs) band, which should be significantly lower
