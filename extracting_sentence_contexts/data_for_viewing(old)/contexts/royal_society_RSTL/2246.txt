months after suhmersion might, in relation to temperature, be what I have imagined.

Dr. DavBexy in his remarks omits to notice the cause I have considered in special
operation for the remoyal of a portion of the oxygen of the air, namely, the peroxi-
dation of the iron. He combats chiefly the opinion I have expressed, that, gene-
rally, air in descending from the surface to the depths of the ocean, will be deprived
of oxygen by the action of living and dead matters swimming or suspended in the
water. He is of opinion that this is not the case ; that it is contrary to the analogy
of nature ; that it is disproved by the existence at great depths of algz of an intensely
green colour. Were this a well authenticated fact, I shonld consider it a decisive
proof; but I am doubtful of the fact. I have never heard of sea weed having been
brought up by the lead from great depths in sounding ; in no charts which I have
ever consulted is such bottom noticed. And there are certain facts which are hardly
in accordance with it; such as the state of iron cannon which haye been sunk in
deep water during a long period, and have been converted, as it were, into plumbago;
such as the preservation of wood under sea water for many years, and indeed for
many centuries, in the bed of the sea, but occasionally brought to light and thrown
up by storms, sweeping away the incumbent layer of sand. The depths of the ocean,
as well as its breakers, may be intended in the economy of nature for other purposes
than those of animal or vegetable life. As on those shores on which the waves dash
