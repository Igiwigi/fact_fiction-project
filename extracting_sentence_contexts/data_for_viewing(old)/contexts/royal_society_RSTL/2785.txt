water does not influence 80 much the calculation of the heights, because the parallax
and declination corrections for the height change very little with the moon's age.

In forming future discussions similar to that contained in this paper, it is desirable
that they should be instituted with reference to the same transit of the moon, namely,
with reference to the transit which precedes the time of high water at London by
about 51 hours +; otherwise even the variations in the heights will not be immediately
comparable with those here given, and the yariations in the interyals will be very
different. This may be seen by comparing the tables in this paper with those which
I obtained formerly with Mr. Dzss10U's assistance, and in which the discussion of
the same obseryations was instituted with reference to the transit immediately pre-
ceding the time of high water. The variations in the interval between two successive
transits of the moon are, in fact, of the same order in amount as those in the interval
between the moon's transit and the time of high water due to the yariations in mag-
nitude of the attractive forces ; and when the interval between the time of high water
and the moon's transit immediately preceding is considered, (at least on our coasts,)
the variations from both these causes are mixed up together.

As the tide-wavye trayels northward to the coasts of Great Britain from the Cape
of Good Hope, passing the French coast, the variations in the interval and in the
height at Brest must be similar to those at London and Liverpool. My results ought,
therefore, to agree with those which may hereafter be deduced from the observations
made at Brest by order of the French Government, and not yet published. The Brest
observations may, however, be rather more accurate than those to which I have had
access; and as the tide is single, the diurnal inequality is perhaps there more
