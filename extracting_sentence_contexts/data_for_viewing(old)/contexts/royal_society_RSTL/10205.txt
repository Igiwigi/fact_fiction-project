The experiments were made consecutively, that is, on 8nccessive days, and, with
the exception of Experiment TV., under precisely similar conditions. In Experi-
ment IV, the temperature was inadvertently allowed to rise to 36?,* a fact which
sufficiently accounts for the 80mewhat earlier beginning of the variation.

The experimental results which have been given justify the statement (1) that
the first phase of the variation is entirely negative ; (2) that it begins (at the tempe-
rature of 32% C.) about one-twentieth of a second after the excitation ; (3) that its
electromotive force rises rapidly at first and subsequently very gradually ; (4) that
ib culminates about the end of the first half-second after excitation and subsides
gradually towards the end of the third half-second.

In the paper which I communicated to the Royal Society with Mr. Pact in 1876,
I stated that the variation of the leaf did not begin until two-tenths of a second after
excitation, and gave the grounds on which the statement was based. The experiments
