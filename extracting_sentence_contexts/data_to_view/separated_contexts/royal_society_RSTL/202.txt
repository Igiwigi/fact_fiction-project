When some lasting cause of formation of steam happens
to be within the air-pump, and that the pump is long worked,


on Evaporation 417

the air is at last almost completely exhausted, and the re-
maining pressure acting on the manometer is that of steam. Mr. NAairneE has shewn me an instance of that effect, in
which the quantity of air indicated by the pear-gage, was
not above 73555 part of the whole. That remarkable fact
will prove, that in the following experiments, air itself was

I exhausted to the utmost degree, and thus reduced to nought
A in respect of any influence on the main phenomena. E I must also premise, whence proceed some anomalies which
ly will be observed in those experiments. It is in general from
5 the nature of steam, from which, in our experiments, it
E is 5ubmitted to certain modifications, depending on its laws,
= but which cannot be always referred to them by immediate
Z explanation, because of undetermined effects of the sides of
E .
