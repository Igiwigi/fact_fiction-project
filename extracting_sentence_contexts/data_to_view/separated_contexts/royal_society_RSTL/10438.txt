The consistency of Mr. TowL1x80N's different determinations of the coefficient of
viscosity of air, notwithstanding the great variation in the cireumstances of the experi-
ments, and the consistency with one another of the numbers got by a different
process by MAxweLL, led me to endeayour to make ont the real cause of the differ-
ence, and I think the main part, ab any rate, of ib can be explained by a yery natural
supposition. The fact that Mr. TowLixsoN worked with air in its ordinary state, whereas
MaxweiL's air was dry, even if ib tends in the right direction, would evidently not
go nearly far enough. But it occurred to me that the effect of any error of level in
the movable disks employed by MAXWELL must have been much greater than might
at first 8ight appear.
