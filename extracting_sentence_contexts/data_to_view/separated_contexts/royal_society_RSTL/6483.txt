Indeed, as acetylene may, accord-
ing to BerTHELOT, be formed from its elements under the influence of the electric dis-
charge, it is inconceivable that a hydrocarbon gas could be perfectly decomposed in
such a tube as I have described. The spectrum under investigation having then been obtained in one case when only
carbon and hydrogen were present, and in another when all elements but carbon and
nitrogen were absent, furnishes, to my mind, sufficient evidence that the spectrum is
that of carbon. But an interesting confirmation of the conclusion just stated is found in the fact, that
the same spectrum is obtained when no other elements but carbon and oxygen are
present, and also when carbon and sulphur are the only elements under examination. And first with regard to carbon and oxygen. Carbonic oxide burned in air gives a
flame possessing a continuous spectrum. '
