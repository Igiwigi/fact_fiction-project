wrist near the radial border and out through the flexors near their ulnar border. The
muscles on the extensor aspect of the wrist tend to be supplied by roots segmentally
© anterior to those which supply the muscles of the flexor aspect ; and those near the
radial border by roots segmentally anterior to those supplying muscles near the ulnar
‘3 border. Hence the flexor profundus digitorum is segmentally posterior to the
extensor communis digitorum, not because the former is deeper than the latter, but
because the flexor aspect of the hand is posterior to the extensor aspect. I find the
palmaris longus, superficial muscle as it is, and lying in the proximal region of the
forearm as it does, is one of the most posterior muscles of the whole limb in
segmental position ; the flexor sublimis digitorum has in several observations seemed
to me to contract more vigorously than the flexor profundus on excitation of
the Ist thoracic, less vigorously than the flexor profundus on excitation of
the VIIth cervical root. The fact that so deep-lying a muscle as the pronator
quadratus gets the very posterior segmental nerve-supply recorded in my table, is
probably explicable by its lying so distally in the forearm. A difficulty is, however,
the superficial part of the intrinsic thumb muscles, which receives a, segmentally-
considered, less posterior motor innervation than the deeper intrinsic thumb muscles.
The anterior position of the thumb as compared with other digits may explain this,
although the difficulty does appear to me considerable. In the leg, as I showed, the
deep flexor of the toes is supplied by nerve-roots segmentally anterior to those
supplying the soleus and gastrocnemius. The arrangement is not a different one in
the two limbs; I believe it to be essentially the same; but it is more clearly
expressed in the lower than in the upper; it was with the upper only that the work
of Henrincuam dealt, and it is in that I admit that the arrangement which I
consider to hold good, to the exclusion of the one formulated by HerrincHay, is the
