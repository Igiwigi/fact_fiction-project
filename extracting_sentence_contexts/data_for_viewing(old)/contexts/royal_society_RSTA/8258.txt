If in Scuuster’s formula (10) we consider s, as a sensitive function of v in the neigh-
bourhood of a characteristic frequency v, zero save in this immediate neighbourhood,
then F,/G, is unity save near v = vy, and as v approaches v» and o, increases, I°,/G,
decreases. We have thus a fair representation of a “ line-contour * if we regard G,
as the intensity of the continuous spectrum between the lines. Observation of the
ratio r, = F,/G, then determines o,. If x, is the atomic scattering coefficient, N the
number of atoms per cm. down to the photospheric radiating surface, then

Hence if «, is known from physical theory, N can be determined from the observed
line-contour. This is the method of Unséip. But it does not follow from this that N
will be independent of v, for the observed shape may not agree exactly with the theoretical
,. In fact until we know how deep to place the photospheric surface there is con-
siderable uncertainty as to what we mean by N. It may be different for different parts
of the line-contour. We require a fusion of the Scuusrer and ScawarzscuiLp models.
