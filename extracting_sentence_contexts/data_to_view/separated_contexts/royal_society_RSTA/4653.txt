(b) Existence of bounded weak solutions

With all the uniform estimates acquired, we can extract (weakly) convergent subsequences. In
fact, we find (we have not relabelled subsequences)

where only the first strong convergence listed requires an explanation. Indeed, the point is to
apply [24, theorem 5] with H!(Qo) Si (29) CL'(2o), which gives us a subsequence ite, —>/p
