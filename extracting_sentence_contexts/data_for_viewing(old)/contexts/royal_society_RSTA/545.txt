With the help of the DMP, we prove pointwise error estimates between u and U z. This result is
essentially due to Baiocchi [13] and Nitsche [9]. It extends to more general variational inequalities
and lower than W2,(.) regularity. We begin with a simple but fundamental growth estimate.

Lemma 2.8 (growth estimate). Assume that u, € W2,(2) and let Te 7. If there is x9 € T such that
(u — W)(xo) = 0, then there is a constant C proportional to |u — Yr|y2.(q) such that

O<(u—W)(x) <Ch, Yee.

Proof. The fact that u—y>0 implies V(u—w)(xo)=0. As u—we W2,(2), we deduce
IV(u — W)llt~cr) < Ch. Applying the mean value theorem yields the asserted estimate. a


Theorem 2.9 (pointwise error estimates). If 7 is weakly acute and u, yy € W2,(@), then there exists
a constant C* > 0 depending on [ulw2,(a) and IW lw2,(2) such that, with n(h z) as in (2.13), we have

lu — Uz Ilt~(a) < C’n(z). (2.14)

Proof. The proof relies on the construction of discrete super- and subsolutions to (2.7).
