Now, we often find that

his gap has a double bundle on its kathodic and a single one on its anodic side (see
A Plate 18, photograph 1, 1.t.°; the kathodic medullary bundle is shown in Plate 21,

fig. 3, the anodic in fig. 2; see also fig. 1, /.t.°).
© If, however, we examine a bundle, which is already passing out through the wood,
2 we find that the medullary strands on either side of it are both single bundles. All
Athis points to the conclusion that a leaf-trace, when followed downwards into the
S pith, turns aside and joins the next medullary strand on its kathodie side. If this were all, it would involve the fact that each medullary strand is a
sympodial bundle, built up of the lower parts of all the leaf-traces of one orthostichy.
colt is, however, more probable that connections also take place in the opposite
‘Adirection, for it is not likely that the bundle system of each orthustichy was quite

isolated from the rest. The frequent occurrence of double medullary bundles in
Bother positions than that already determined (see Plate 21, fig. 1) perhaps points
-2 to the existence of these additional fusions. Tn any case, we may safely draw the following general conclusion as to the course
-pof the vascular bundles : the bundle-system in the stem of Lyginodendron is entirely
Sa leaf-trace system.
