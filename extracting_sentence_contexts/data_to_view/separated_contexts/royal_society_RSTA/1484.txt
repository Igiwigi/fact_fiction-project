We note that the
NROY space is fairly clustered along a specific curve in this space. At high compressive normal
stresses, this seismic moment is produced for shear/normal stress ratios of around 0.16, while
at lower normal stresses the shear/normal stress must be slightly higher near 0.2 to produce the
known value. At very low shear to normal stresses, there is a region that cannot be ruled out,
though the fact that this occurs near the boundary of the space suggests this may be an artefact
of our original sampling. Designs with 50 sample points do not exhibit this feature. We note that
the projection shown in figure 4 was found to capture most of the structure in the space, and
suggests that the additional normal stress component is less important for predicting the final
seismic moment in our simulations.
