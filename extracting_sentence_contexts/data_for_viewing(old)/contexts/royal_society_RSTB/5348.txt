Similarly, a portion of the subganglionic division of the cranial sclerotomite (= inter-
dorsal) partakes in the formation both of the neural arch as well as of the dorso-lateral
portion of the secondary vertebral body.

SCHAUINSLAND’S supposition that the neural arches in birds are not products of a
single metamere but belong like the vertebral bodies to two different sclerotomes, which,


THE VERTEBRAL COLUMN IN BIRDS, 333

he endeavoured to prove by fragmentary embryological evidence, can thus be confirmed
by a continuous series of embryological facts. The principle of resegmentation thus
holds true not only in the case of vertebral bodies but also in the vertebral arches.

Observations made on Larus and Struthio prove that the nature of the ‘ subchordale
Spange ” of Frortep is not so elementary as was described by him for the cervical region
of the vertebral column in chick. The material from which is formed the “ subchordale
Spange ” of FRorrep is furnished by the ventral portion of the hoop-like “ primitiver
Wirbelbégen,” or in other terms by the subchordal portion of the sclerotomes. The
latter in Larus and Struthio consists of an anterior portion derived from the cranial
sclerotomite (= interventral) and a posterior portion produced by the caudal sclerotomite
= basiventral). Despite the obliteration of the intrasclerotomic fissure separating
in earlier stages both components of the subchordal sclerotome, they, nevertheless,
can be distinguished by their different structure and stain. At the same time each
