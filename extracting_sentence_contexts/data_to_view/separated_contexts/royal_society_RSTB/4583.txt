The account is only to a small degree
original, and to a less extent exhaustive. It is necessary, however, to prefix a résumé
of this kind to the morphological and morphogenetic considerations of the succeeding
sections. Although but few of the observations recorded are new, it is believed that
the facts already known are here first collected into a coherent scheme, and that
they are interpreted in a fresh manner. For the ambulacral characters of the Palszeozoic Echinoids, I have relied almost
entirely on JacKson’s “ Phylogeny of the Echini” (1912). The account of these
structures in the other Regular orders has been gathered from a very large number
of sources.
