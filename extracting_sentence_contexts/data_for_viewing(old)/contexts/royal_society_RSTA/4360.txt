in the three frames of genes of both prokaryotes and eukaryotes showed that the trinucleotides are
not uniformly distributed in these three frames [12]. By excluding the four periodic trinucleotides
and by assigning each trinucleotide to a preferential frame (frame of highest occurrence
frequency), three subsets X = Xg, X; and X» of 20 trinucleotides were found in the frames 0
(reading frame), 1 (frame 0 shifted by one nucleotide) and 2 (frame 0 shifted by two nucleotides)
in genes of both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. This set X contains the following 20 trinucleotides:

X = {AAC, AAT, ACC, ATC, ATT, CAG, CTC, CTG, GAA, GAC,
GAG, GAT, GCC, GGC, GGT, GTA, GTC, GTT, TAC, TTC}.

The two sets X; and X3, of 20 trinucleotides each, in the shifted frames 1 and 2, respectively,
of genes can be deduced from X by a circular permutation. These three trinucleotide sets
present several strong mathematical properties, particularly the fact that X is a maximal C° self-
complementary trinucleotide circular code [12]. The subset {CAG, CTC, CTG, GAG} of the circular
code X is a trinucleotide comma-free code and, furthermore, C? and self-complementary [13].
Comma-free codes are important codes as they represent a limit class of circular codes with three
particular properties: (i) no word of a comma-free code is found in a shifted frame; (ii) the length
of reading frame retrieval is the shortest; and (iii) the probability of reading frame coding is
maximal and equal to 1 [14]. In 2015, by quantifying the approach used in 1996 for identifying
a preferential frame and by applying a massive statistical analysis of gene taxonomic groups,
the circular code X was strengthened in genes of prokaryotes (7851762 genes, 2481566 882
trinucleotides) and eukaryotes (1662579 genes, 824825761 trinucleotides), and has now also
been identified in genes of plasmids (237 486 genes, 68 244 356 trinucleotides) and viruses (184 344
genes, 45 688 798 trinucleotides) [15]. Several non-maximal cs self-complementary circular codes
have been identified in genes of viruses (table 1 in [15]) which are all subsets of X (table 7d in [15]):
