SECTION III. APPLICATION OF THE FACTS TO THE ANALYSIS OF MIXTURES OF
THE COMBUSTIBLE GASES IN UNKNOWN PROPORTIONS. At an early period of the investigation described in the
first 'section; I proceeded to apply the facts of which I was
then possessed, to the analysis of a mixture of gases in un-
known proportions. For this purpose, I caused a quantity of
gas to be collected from coal, by continuing the application of
heat to the retorts two hours beyond the usual period, and
receiving the gas iinto-a separate vessel. Gas of this quality
was purposely'' chosen, because, from former. experience, I
expected it to. contain free hydrogen, carbonic oxide, and
carburetted hydrogen, but no olefiant gas, the production of
which is. confined to the early stages of the progress.
