The marked end of the magnet, when looked
at at 8 A.M., is 8cen at Port Kennedy to have moved from its mean position of S. 35* W.
towards the geographical West, and at Point Barrow to haye moved from its mean position
of N. 41*E. towards the geographical Fast; and correspondingly at 2 p.x. the marked end
is at Port Kennedy to the geographical Z#ast of its mean position, and at Point Barrow
to the geographical West. The bearing of this distinction between the magnetical and
geographical aspects of the facts upon physical explanations will be evident if we advert
to the hypothesis of currents of thermic origin, either in the earth or in the atmosphere,
generated by the rotation of the earth in presence of the sun. It may be well therefore
to take a more general view of the phenomena of which the two stations which have
been here compared present a particular case, which fortunately is a very notable and
instructive one. Let us imagine (as in the woodcut in the next page) two stations, @
and 6, both situated in the vicinity of the dip of 90; and (to avoid questions of abso-
lute and local time) let us assume them to be in the same geographical meridian, « being
situated to the geographical north, and þ to the geographical south of the locality where
the dip is 90%.
