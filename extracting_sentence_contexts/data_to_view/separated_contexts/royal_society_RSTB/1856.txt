that he had observed tbe perforation of the pit in the pollen tube in Pinus pumilio; he gives, however,
no figure.

+ Srnassurcer (8) clearly recognised that the egg nucleus of the Abietinew had a peculiar structure,
in fact, he states that the nucleus, while moving back to the centre of the egg, fills itself with meta-
plasmic substance. He believed, however, that the metaplasm masked the real chromatin, and also
that it was not generally distributed, but confined to the upper portion only of the nucleus: the meta-
plasm he considered to be of the same nature as the substance in the proteid vacuoles.
