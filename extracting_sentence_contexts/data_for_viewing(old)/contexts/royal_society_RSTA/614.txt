side indicates that the spectral out-of-band measurements are as important as the spectral in-band
measurements when performing primary radiometric thermometry in this spectral region. The
need for low uncertainty measurements of spectral responsivities can be especially challenging
with near-infrared detectors which are not as well characterized as their visible counterparts, and
low uncertainty measurements in the out-of-band region could be difficult using detectors with
radiometric scales which can have substantially larger uncertainties than in the visible.

3. Design of a near-infrared primary radiometric thermometer

(a) Optical and chassis design

The physical design of a near-infrared radiation thermometer is not different from that of a
radiation thermometer which operates in the visible wavelength region. This is due to the fact that


Table 1. The optical performances quantified by the Strehl ratio as a function of wavelength for a commercial 200 mm focal-
length achromatic objective lens. Higher Strehl ratios indicate better imaging performance, and the same lens exhibits better
imaging performance at 1550 nm than at 500 nm. Moving the object distance at 1550 nm to achieve the same image distance
as at 500 nm further improves the imaging performance.
