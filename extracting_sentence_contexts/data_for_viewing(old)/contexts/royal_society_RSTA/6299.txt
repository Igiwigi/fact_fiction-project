V(p); it then follows by induction that M, wl At if and only if (K,<,V),wlt.A. So assume that
M,wlt t(p). Equivalently, M,wlt y, for some v € V(p). We have seen that this is equivalent to
w >= v for some v € V(p), which, by persistence, holds if and only if w € V(p). a


Note that IPC is characterized by the class of finite trees [23, theorem 6.12]. To show that IPC | 10 |
is characterized by the class of finite splitting tress, note that duplicating branches of a tree does
not change the formulas satisfied at the root. a

Corollary 4.5. Let T be a subclassical recursively enumerable set theory. If T is extensible, then the 1a
propositional logic of T is intuitionistic propositional logic IPC, i.e. L(T) = IPC. :&

Let us first observe the following helpful fact. Recall that a theory T has the disjunction gs
property whenever TF g Vv y implies TF g or TF yp.

Lemma 4.6. If T is an extensible set theory, then T has the disjunction property. :2

Proof. By contraposition. Assume that Tf g and TI‘ w, then there are models Mo and M of T 1S
such that Mo |/ g and M; |¥ w. Let M be the disjoint union of these models, then M* It T as T is :s
extensible. Moreover, persistence implies that M* If g v y; hence, Tig V w. a [>

Lemma 4.7. If T is an extensible set theory, then Visser's rules are admissible in T. ts

Proof. By lemma 4.6, it is sufficient to show that the following rules V;, are admissible: Do
