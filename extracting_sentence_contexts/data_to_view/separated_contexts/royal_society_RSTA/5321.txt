Under ordinary circumstances, their dead bodies, like those of other wild
animals, are devoured by Carnivora, or rapidly disappear from the surface under
atmospheric and other agencies. Even supposing the accumulation of the bones to
have been effected in some way by successive additions, the usual weathering would
have caused great inequality in their state of preservation, whereas, as a rule, all the
bones in the breccia seem to have been in the same almost fresh state, with the
exception of the specimens near the surface, which have lost more of their animal
matter. Besides, as the bones are those of animals of all ages—including the unborn
—this fact is, I think, conclusive against this explanation. The circumstances, therefore, which led to these remarkable accumulations of the
remains of the Hippopotami must have been extraordinary, and I see no hypothesis
which meets the case, so well as the one that I have suggested to account for the
bones of Mammalia in the Rubble-drift and in the ossiferous fissures, though the local
conditions in this case are peculiar. On the submergence of the Sicilian area, the wild animals of the plains would, as
in the case of Santenay, Cette, and Gibraltar, be driven to seek refuge on the nearest
adjacent high ground and hills.
