* The aggregate may be supposed to be comparable in size with a wave-length of light ; the intensity
of the light reflected from it would thus be proportional to the square of its diameter, while the intensity
of the light diffracted by the small spheres is proportional only to the sixth power of their diameters.

{| A similar explanation possibly applies to the fact that when light, transmitted through a stretched
membrane containing gold in suspension, is polarised in the direction of stretching, the emergent light is
red, but when the incident light is polarised in a perpendicular direction the colour is blue, the gold
clumps being comparable with a wave-length in the direction of stretching, but not in a perpendicular
direction. (Cf. AMBRONN, ‘ Ber. d. math.-phys. Kl. d. k. Siichs, Gesellsch. d. Wissensch.,’ December 7, 1896,

Tn conclusion, we remark that most “ colloidal solutions” of gold, even those which
are of a ruby colour, contain crystallites in addition to the small spheres to which the
colour is primarily due. Thus Farapay could detect the green “cone of light,”
