exaggerated. To the eye the image of the arc is scarcely visible compared with
those of the carbons. The photographs illustrate the well-known fact that almost
all the visible light comes from the carbons, but most of the ultra-violet from the
cyanogen bands in the arc itself. It will be seen that the arc length was about 2-7 mm in fig. 1, and 3-2 mm in
fig. 2. The former length is slightly above the minimum (2-5 mm) necessary to
ensure absence of shading, and is almost an ideal length for working ; the latter
is slightly too long, as a long are increases the curvature of the positive carbon end,
and increases also the importance of the ultra-violet radiation from the arc, which
is probably more affected by slight variations in the purity of the carbons than is
the light from the carbon tip.
