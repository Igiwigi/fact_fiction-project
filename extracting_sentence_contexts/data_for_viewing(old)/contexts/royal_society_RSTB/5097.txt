of this groove are two others at right angles to each other ; one of these, for the posterior
vertical semicircular canal, passes upward and backward until it is truncated by the
surface to which the supraoccipital was attached; the other runs forward until it is
suddenly deepened and then terminates at the anterior end of the bone.

The posterior part of the angle where the inner surface cuts the dorsal surface, is
chamfered off by a face for attachment of the supraoccipital.

The interpretation of the grooves on the inner surface of the otic bones is very difficult ;
they are obviously associated with the semicircular canals, and the certain absence of
any foramina tunnelling the bones shows that they must represent impressions of the
outer surface of the labyrinth, that organ lying entirely within the bony cranial cavity,
not separated from the brain by any bone. The conditions must, in fact, have been
as in certain bony fish, and as in the rachitomous amphibian Trimerorachis. The
basisphenoid and parasphenoid are indistinguishably fused. Posteriorly, the joint bone
forms a thin film covering the ventral and lateral surfaces of the basioccipital ; but
leaving the dorsal part of the lateral surface of that bone exposed. In the pro-otic region
the bone is more solid in structure, the lower end of the pro-otic articulating with a facet
carried on the end of a projection from the upper edge of the bone. Ventral to this
facet, the basisphenoid forms part of the border of the large opening through which
the Vâ„¢ nerve leaves the cranial cavity. Below this opening the basisphenoid is con-
tinued forward by a process which meets the back of the ethmoid and was in life sepa-
rated from its fellow by a space through which the infundibulum and the optic and
eye-muscle nerves passed downwards. This process forms the upper border of another
opening whose lower border is formed by the parasphenoid, and which is closed in front
