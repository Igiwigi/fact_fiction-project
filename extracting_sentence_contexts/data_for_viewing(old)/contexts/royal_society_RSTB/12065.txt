cases, sequester cardenolides from Apocynaceae plants,
which include milkweed [15]. Cardenolides represent a class
of steroidal glycosides (‘cardiac glycosides’) that bind to and
inhibit the alpha-subunit of Na*,K*-ATPase (ATP). This
protein is a ubiquitously distributed membrane-bound ion
active-transporter present in animals with well-known roles
in a variety of physiological processes including neural signal
transduction, muscle contraction and osmoregulation [17].
Conservation of the cardenolide-binding domain of ATPa
among distantly-related animals, including vertebrates and
invertebrates, suggests important physiological roles for the
regulation of Na‘,K‘'-ATPase by endogenously produced
cardenolides [17,18]. In fact, cardenolides have been used
medicinally for hundreds of years as common treatments for
conditions such as congestive heart failure and cardiac arrhyth-
mias [18]. A growing number of studies have implicated
the regulation of Na*,K*-ATPase by putatively endogenous
cardenolides in signalling pathways linked to a variety of
pathologies including hypertension and cancer [19,20].

Owing to its medical importance, the interaction between
Nat,K*-ATPase and cardenolides has been well-studied. The
binding of cardenolides arrests Na‘,K*-ATPase in the phos-
phorylated state, where K* cannot be bound, Na* cannot be
released to the extracellular side and ATP is not hydrolysed
