In the majority of cases the young
tubercles are quite evident some time during the fourth week following, and a little
experience enables one to detect them at least a week sooner than that. Now, seedlings carefully germinated in the same garden soil, previously sterilised
by being burnt, and subsequently treated similarly, do not yield tubercles at all. *
This fact is in itself strong evidence of the infection coming from the soil. It may be well to state the composition of the nutritive solutions T have employed,
and the mode of treating the plants grown in them. In all the cases referred to the solution employed was that given by Sacus in his
‘Vorlesungen iiber Pflanzenphysiologie,’t care being taken that all vessels and utensils
were clean, and the water and reagents pure.
