In correspondence during the consideration of Frank Fraser Darling, the Editor of Science
Talks invites him to lunch to discuss potential programming given the fact that ‘We have noticed
that 1970 is European Conservation year, etc., etc., and of course, there was the OECD inter-

and man in it’ (Correspondence: Archie Clow to Frank Fraser Darling, 20 February 1969). In the
