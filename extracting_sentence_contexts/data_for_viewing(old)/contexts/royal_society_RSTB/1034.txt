At 6.10 the lower of the isolated fields of reflex reply finally delimited (i.c., the field of the
Ind thoracic root).

“The boundary of the lower of the isolated fields of reply extends from a point one-third down the
¢ m at the junction of the ulnar and flexor aspects, thence upwards, sloping across the subcutaneous
ce of the root of the olecranon, and up the space between the olecranon and the inner condyle.
‘hence it passes up the upper arm along the middle of its posterior aspect on the subcutaneous surface
f the triceps just behind the biceps and just behind the deltoid muscle, to meet the spine of the scapula
i its junction with the root of the acromion; and then returns, and soon recurves upward again, and
tires again. It thus leaves a Y-shaped piece with a double tongue, each tongue about 2 centims. wide,
the popper passing across the axillary border of the scapula, to as far as the scapular spine, the lower not
e reaching that retiring scapular edge, but getting to within less than a centimetre of it. The
er tongue runs, in fact, down the fold of muscle covering the scapular edge, and turns up upon it
again, so that it follows the posterior fold of the axillary space for a certain extent, and comes down the
ipper arm in the groove, or a little behind the groove between the triceps and biceps muscles. It so
es to lie in front of, i.e., on the flexor face of, the muscular origins from the inner condyle, and then
es the point it was traced from about one-third down the forearm.”
