so as to put the pressure on verticallyâ€”above and below. On examination of this spot
it was found that the tracheary elements on the upper side of the branch were crushed,
distorted and mixed with parenchyma and resin canals. The growth on the upper
side was also very limited, while on the lower hyponastic side, where the tracheids are
normally thicker-walled, there appeared to be little or no disturbance of the wood
elements. The response in the production of resin canals corresponds with the evidence
of injury. It is greater above, where there is a slightly tangential arrangement, while
below the canals are few and scattered. Of the false ring, however, the reverse is true,
it being more developed below than above. Unfortunately, the branches were from
the upper part of a tree old enough, being a garden plant of about ten years of age, to
have some other resin canals in it, and so less valuable for demonstration. However,
the traumatic series and false annual ring arose from the wound area, and extended
for a considerable distance above it. In fact, the photograph was taken from a section
about a centimetre above the peg. :

The root has not made so much growth as the branch after the application of the peg,
and so the result is more difficult to represent in a photograph (Photo. 34), since only
a few of the canals have opened up, and there is much parenchyma associated with them.
The root, like the branch, was in its second year, but we have only included a small
portion of the tissues because of the necessity of a high power photograph to indicate
the details. The cambium is to the right and some of the normal wood elements to
the left. Below there is one big open resin canal, and above it a line of parenchyma
extending directly to the irregular lumen of a second canal. In the centre of the
photograph and one row of tracheids to the right of the line of parenchyma is a mass
of such cells, whose splitting apart has just begun, forming a tangentially broadened
