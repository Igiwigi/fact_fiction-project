might be to use the mechanism employed by botulinum
toxin by binding to recycling synaptic vesicles [70]. Only
further experiments could settle this issue.

Our present hypothesis relating to exosomes involves a
simple logical step from a previous hypothesis and offers
an explanation for a large and growing body of heretofore
unassimilated data. The deafferentation and reafferentation
observations demonstrate that afferent nerves carry codes
that produce extensive structural and functional changes in
the postsynaptic neuron. Some of these codes may be electri-
cal, but others may be molecular. Results from cell biology
studies reveal that exosomes do in fact transport and deliver
across synapses precisely the type of molecule necessary to
carry such a molecular code. This would seem to be an unli-
