The intensity of the shearing makes up in good

VY 8uch as to ſorbid us to treat the mean free path as infinitesimal long before we are
-- prohibited from 80 regarding it in comparison with the dimensions of the vessel, or
| 5 the lateral dimensions of the lamina. That among the four unmixed gases examined
QA oxygen 8hould be the one to show this effect, seems to be connected with the fact that

at comparatively low exhaustions (such as 076 millim.) i shows repulsion effects much
the mos strongly ; and both phenomena seem to indicate that for oxygen the length
of path (I do not say free path) is comparatively large, * path ” here meaning the
space throughout which a molecule preserves approximately its origiual direction of
motion. When we come to those high exhanstions at which the decrement of arc gives way,
the law of proportional logarithmic decrements at corresponding (and those pro-
portional) pressures, which we hitherto found to be 80 accurately obeyed, breaks down
altogether. A single example will suffice to show this.
