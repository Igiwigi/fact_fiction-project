surface may facilitate those rapid minute motions of neighbouring fasciculi one
against another, which will afterwards be shown to occur, in all likelihood, in con-
tracting muscle; and 3rdly, That, from its apparent similarity in structure to the
membrane of the nervous tubules, which run among the fasciculi, and between
which and the proper contractile tissue it seems certainly to intervene, as well as
from its extensive contact and union with the surface of the latter, it may be the
conducting medium of that influence, whose mode of propagation the late discoveries
of the loop-like termination of the nerves of muscle, have hitherto only seemed to
render more inexplicable than ever.

Of the Corpuscles of the Primitive Fasciculi.

There is a fact in the anatomical history of voluntary muscle which, from its appa-
rent universality, is entitled to some attention, and yet which seems hitherto to have
escaped the notice of anatomists ; this is, The existence in the primitive fasciculi of
minute bodies of a definite form and structure, generally invisible, unless rendered
evident by special modes of preparation. The most ready method of demonstrating
them, is to touch the specimen with a small quantity of one of the milder acids, as
the citric. These agents cause an instantaneous tumescence and transparency of the
fasciculi, as has already been stated, and the corpuscles become at once clearly de-
fined. But by the swelling of the fibrille among which they are situated, they may
be seen to undergo s0me distortion from their real shape, and it is generally in certain
parts alone, as where fibrille baye escaped from the sarcolemma, or the corpuscles
become detached, that they present their natural characters. They then appear to be
