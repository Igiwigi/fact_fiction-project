In that case, bands of carotenoid
(1527, 1154cm7!) and also chlorophyll (1326, 915, 747 cm~1) were registered. Raman features
of pigments were detected only after positioning and focusing on parts with high density of
algal colonization. In fact, this was the only case in this study when organic Raman bands were
registered also using the 785nm laser. No bands owing to organics were detected within the
powdered JH sample. On the other hand, the 785nm laser showed better S/N ratio for the
detection of sulfate/carbonate mineral matrix in the cases when the fluorescence background
was at reasonable level (figure 2).
