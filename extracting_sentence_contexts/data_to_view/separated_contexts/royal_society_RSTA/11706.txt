To test whether Oum’s law was obeyed, we applied a voltage of 155 volts, and took
the resistance both ways, up to three minutes, reversing several times first. The
mean value was R = 4°69 X 10", instead of 2°6 x 10”, when we used the higher
voltage. This result was probably affected both by the fact that the large voltage
was applied first, and by the influence of the time action, though the latter was
eliminated so far as possible. We do not think that the deviation from Oum’s law
observed can be explained away by any of these effects. A substance, whose
conductivity may be a function of the quantity of electricity which has passed
through it, can hardly be expected to obey Ouw’s law.
