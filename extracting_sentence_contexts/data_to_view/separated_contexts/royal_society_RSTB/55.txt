ยง 1. Introduction. Our attention was directed to the action of the excised Mammalian heart in the
course of experiments relating to the electromotive action of various tissues, by our
observation of the fact that the electromotive variations indicative of action outlast
visible contractions ; secondly, that the contractions of the excised organ are of an
extraordinarily prolonged character. We consequently pursued our observations (1) by the galvanometer, (2) by the aid
of the graphic method, (3) by the capillary electrometer (Lippmann). By the
galvanometer and by the electrometer we observed the electrical changes consequent
upon spontaneous or provoked contraction, and in the absence of visible contraction.
