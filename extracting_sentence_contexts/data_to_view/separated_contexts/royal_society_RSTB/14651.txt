Robust and sensitive trait-to-community maps. Community-member species can access a limited region of the trait space by mutations and recombination
(large grey ovals around the wild-type). Arrows show the fact that species traits determine community-level properties. A robust trait-to-community map (left) is
one where communities formed by accessible variants have similar properties (coloured regions). A sensitive map (right) is one where communities formed by
different accessible variants have distinct properties. (Online version in colour.)

that at the level of the underlying traits of community mem- intermediate trait-to-community maps are realized in differ-
bers.
