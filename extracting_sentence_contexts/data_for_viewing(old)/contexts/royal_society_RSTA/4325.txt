there is no way to examine the AM any more in that case. For EMD, however, any multiplicative
process-induced energy intensity fluctuation could only be examined indirectly from the AM,
which leads to the new high-dimensional, full informational spectral analysis to be given in the
next section.

3. A full informational, complete frequency-domain representation:
Holo-Hilbert spectral analysis

For any data, after the necessary first additive decomposition, we have the expansion given in
equation (1.3). The carrier FM part has been covered in the HSA [7], in which the variation of the
amplitude is implicitly expressed as the temporal modulations of the spectral intensity without
further expansion or conversion into the frequency domain. Thus, this time-frequency analysis is
in fact an incomplete spectral analysis.

Here, we are going to concentrate on the variation of the amplitude function, a;(t). In the above
example of multiplicative interaction between the sinusoidal wave and the white noise, the IMFs
of the data (in figure 2b) are given in figure 4a and the corresponding Hilbert spectrum is given
in figure 4b. Although one can clearly see modulation of the IMFs especially in the first few
IMF components, the Hilbert spectrum fails to reveal any trace of the modulation effects by the
sinusoidal wave, which should appear along the dotted line given in this figure. The modulation
can be seen only in the energy density fluctuation at the carrier frequency range. Neither Fourier
nor the HSA could represent the effects of multiplicative processes, being as they are based on
additive expansions (see ยง1).

Now let us examine the IMFs given in figure 4a again. Let us compute the envelopes for the
