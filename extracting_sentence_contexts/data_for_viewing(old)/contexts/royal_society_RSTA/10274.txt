ON COLOURS IN METAL GLASSES, ETC. 285

All these properties are shared by Farapay’s “ phosphorous” gold,* so that our
expectation is, so far, fulfilled. We are, in fact, perfectly familiar with “mere
aggregations of discontinuous material ” which are optically continuous—for example,
gold ruby glass.

Many of the observations which Carry Lea has recorded on the colours of his
silver films are in accordance with the expectation that these films, like Brmpy’s
gold films and Farapay’s “ phosphorous” gold, should behave according to the laws
(a), (b), and (c) stated above. But two difficulties arise in the way of this
accordance, for, in the first place Carry Lxa’s recorded observations do not
sufficiently distinguish between transmitted and reflected light. For example le
recordst that his freely precipitated silver dissolves to a blood-red colour, and
