While pollen grains with an extra chromosome are known
to be at a disadvantage in competition, so that they seldom function in fertilization,
the same apparently does not apply to megaspores, and as the mechanism of meiosis
is the same in both, non-disjunction must also occur in the production of megaspores. It follows inevitably that any wild Oenothera showing catentation may be expected
to produce trisomic seeds. That they never lead in this genus to the production of
species with 16 chromosomes is indicated by the fact that all the wild species hitherto
studied agree in having 14.*

It is worth noting here that six trisomic types with 17 chromosomes have been
found (Srussr, 1934) among a large number of other aberrants in the offspring of
X-rayed plants of Antirrhinum majus. They are more or less highly male sterile and
differ from the type in such characters as leaf size, shape and colour, size and shape
of flower, colour of lip and density of the raceme.

* One tetraploid species, O. glauca, has, however, been found (ScHweMMLE, 1924) ; and the
same author (1928) found in the F, from O. Berteriana x odorata a diploid plant with certain tetraploid
(46) branches.
