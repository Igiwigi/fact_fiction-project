The work of Heilbron eÂ¢ a/. is the most thorough that has been done. They worked
with large quantities of material and investigated several species of anemone. From
Anemonia sulcata they obtained a new xanthophyll, sulcatoxanthin, in addition to
pigments derived from the symbiotic algae. They also worked on Metridium senile
(Actinoloba dianthus), in which they found a red ester and a small amount of another
carotenoid. Dr Jackson kindly informs us that the red variety was used.

It is evident that each species of anemone may contain a variety of carotenoids,
many of which are chemically unique. Moreover, the work of Fabre and Lederer on
the green and the red Actinia shows that different colour varieties may differ in their
carotenoids. In Metridium senile the variation of hue even in the red variety is great
enough to suggest that more than one pigment may be concerned in different cases,
and our observations will show that this is indeed the case. This fact raised for us a
great practical difficulty. If individual varieties vary in their carotenoids, one can
no longer be content with results obtained from large masses of material. Single
individuals or collections restricted to the same asexual stock must be used, and the
quantity of pigment available for accurate investigation is correspondingly diminished.
