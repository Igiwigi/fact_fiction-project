The keel consisted of early procartilage which was
not yet sharply defined from the surrounding tissue, and the general orientation of cells
in the keel region was similar to that already described in early cultures of the complete
sternum. The isolated plates formed a longer keel rudiment than the explants of the
complete sternum. This was probably due to the fact that in the half-sterna the keel
was better nourished than in the complete sterna owing partly to its peripheral position
in the culture, and partly to the fact that a large part of it lay parallel with the culture
medium instead of projecting vertically away from it as in the complete sterna. The
posterior lateral processes were visible, though still mesenchymatous. Many necrotic
cells occurred in the connective tissue in the morphologically median part of the
explant.
