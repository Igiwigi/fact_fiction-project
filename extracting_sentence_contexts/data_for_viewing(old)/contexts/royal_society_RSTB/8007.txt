included at two points in table 2, where the younger females are listed in approximate
order of age, as indicated by the molar teeth. It is probable that tooth wear will differ in
such an animal from that in the wild state, and as the series in table 2 is arranged in order
of the stage of dentition it will be seen that in fact this captive animal, Dicksie, was longer
and taller than the wild animals at similar stages of dentition. The circumference of the
forefoot did not exceed that of the wild animals of similar dentition, but this is probably
due to the fact that Dicksie was relatively poorly developed in muscle and fat, and would
be judged to be much lighter than a typical wild animal of similar skeletal dimensions. ‘The
implication is that the captive animal wears its teeth more slowly than the wild one, so that
using its age as an indication of that of wild animals at a similar stage of dentition will give
a maximal estimate of the age of the wild ones. When captured on 31 October 1940, this
elephant was believed to be 6 to 9 months old, but the height at the withers is given as

series. Furthermore, although Dicksie was not weighed at the time, her first owner reports
that he could lift her clear of the ground, which indicated that she could not have been
