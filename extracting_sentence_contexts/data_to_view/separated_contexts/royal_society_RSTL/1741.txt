Thus we find, that during the first four days of the pupa state, there is but little
alteration of structure, beyond what exists at the actual period of changing from
the larva; the energy of the insect having been partially exhausted during the
effort of transformation. But when it has remained for some time at rest, its
energy is restored, and the change again advances. That such is in reality the
case seems to be supported by the fact, that when a larya has become 80 ex-

hausted as to be unable to rid itself of the exuviz, and complete its transforma-
tion, owing to its having been prevented from remaining at rest during the
proper period, the change in its nervous system is neyer 80 much advanced
as in those which have transformed without interruption ; nor does it make
any further progress even in seven days, while the insect itself generally
perishes in less than a fortnight. After the insect has remained for about five weeks in the pupa state, scarcely
any further change occurs in its nervous system until the following spring. This period of repose, during which the insect remains nearly torpid in its cell
in the earth, continues for at least twenty-three or twenty-four weeks, and ex-
tends in general from the middle of October to the beginning of the following
March, when, if the season be temperate, the change again advances.
