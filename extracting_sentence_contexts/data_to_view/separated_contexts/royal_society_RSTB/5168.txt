An examination of the type-fossil in the
Copenhagen Museum convinced me of its specific identity with the larger impression
shown in fig. 112. The lamina is torn and there is no reason to suppose that it was
originally trilobed, as Heer described it. KrassErÂ§ considered M. dentatus to be a
stipule of a Liriodendron leaf, but this is very improbable, even apart from the fact that
we have no real evidence of the occurrence of Liriodendron in the Cretaceous vegetation of
Greenland. In the radially disposed veins the Igdlukunguak fossil agrees with Nelumbium and
several Menispermaceous species. Hexr described an incomplete leaf from the same
locality as Nelumbium arcticum,|| which differs from Menispermites dentatus in the greater
breadth of the veins and in the presence of a median rib.
