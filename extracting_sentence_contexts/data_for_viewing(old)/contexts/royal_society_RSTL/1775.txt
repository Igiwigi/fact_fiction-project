Thar peculiar condition of certain mammalia during the winter season, which
has been designated hybernation, has been aptly compared by yarious authors
to ordinary sleep. In both the respiration is diminished. This fact was first
determined, in regard to sleep, by Messrs. ALLEN and Pgeys*. It obtains in
a much higher degree in the state of hybernation. It is highly probable
that in sleep, as in hybernation, the irritability of the muscular fibre becomes
augmented. These two conditions of the animal system may therefore mutu-
ally illustrate each other.

Ordinary sleep is similar to the sleep of the hybernating animal ; and the
sleep of the hybernating animal is similar to that deeper sleep, or lethargy,
which is designated hybernation. We are thus led to trace a connexion be-
tween the recurrent sleep of all animals, and the deep and protracted sleep of
a few.
