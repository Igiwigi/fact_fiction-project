734 MR. G. J. ROMANES ON THE LOCOMOTOR SYSTEM OF MEDUSZE.

specimens this effect is sometimes only observable, or best obseryable, at the commence-
ment of a swimming-bout; for in such specimens, after a greater or less number of unco-
ordinated contractions, the four quadrants begin to agree, as it were, upon their rhythm.
"This, of course, is what might be expected on the above hypothesis regarding con-
tractile waves eliciting ganglionic discharges, and all the ganglia requiring about the
$ame time for their nutrition ; and the reason why the loss of coordination under this
form of section is more marked in the discophorous species of naked-eyed Meduse than
in Sarsia, is doubtless merely because the passage of contractile wayes is 80 much more
slow and s0 much less energetic, Therefore in vigorous specimens, where these waves
pass more readily, we obtain results under this form of section most conformable to those
which we obtain in Sars/a, viz. a sort of fictitious coordination which begins to come on
after a variable number of contractions have been given, and which, as just stated, is
doubtless due to the fact of all the marginal ganglia requiring the same time for their
recovery from the exhaustion consequent on the occurrence of each discharge.

(4) It is a remarkable thing that this form of section, although in actual amount
80 very 8light, is attended with a much more pernicious influence on the vitality of the
organism than is any amount of section of the general contractile tissues. Thus if a
specimen of Tiaropsis, for example, be chosen which is swimming about with the
utmost vigour, and if four equidistant radial cuts only just long enough to sever the
marginal canal be made, the animal will s0on begin to show symptoms of enfeeblement,
and within an hour or two after the operation will probably have ceased its swimming
motions altogether. The animal, however, is not actually dead; for if, while lying
