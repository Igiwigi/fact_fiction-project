But it is possible to arrive at a probable estimate by
the following considerations. The limit D (©) will probably be in step with those of
Cu and Ag, viz., 31515, 30644, z.e., will be in the neighbourhood of 30000. Now A
. must give y = 3815°54 and must itself’ be a multiple of the oun, in fact if it is similar
to Cu and Ag of 3,. Now W =197°20 with an uncertainty of a few units in the
second decimal place. The ratio g = 861°80*+y, where y is probably not greater
than 1 in the first decimal place and it will be regarded as a correction on the ‘8.
