The experiments from EmeRsoN, on solids of different forms
might be made; but the time and trouble these experiments
have already cost, have compelled me to relinquish far-
ther pursuits for the present. If, however, in the absence of
. better, they are worthy of the indulgence of the Royal Society,
it will not only be a consolation to me that my labours merit
their attention, but a farther inducement to prosecute the
investigation of useful facts, which, even in the present ad-
vanced state of knowledge, will yet admit of addition. I am, with much respect,

GEORGE RENNIE,

Since my return to England, I find that a set of experi-
ments have been undertaken by Mr. PETER BarLow, of tlie


136 Mr. RENNIE's account of experiments, &c.

Royal Military Academy. They are very interesting, but
contain no experiments on the repulsive power of bodies, and
consequently, my communication is not altogether super-
seded, although a space of seven months has elapsed since
this was written.
