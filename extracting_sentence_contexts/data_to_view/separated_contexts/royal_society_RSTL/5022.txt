And first, when a cone of white light coming from
the sun is admitted horizontally into the fluid, as close as possible to its upper
surface,.and the beautiful red beam of dispersed light is analysed by a prism, the
Spectrum is found to consist of a bright red band of a certain breadth, followed by
a dark interval, and then a much broader green band not near 80 brilliant. There
is usually but little false dispersion, and what there is may be almost entirely got
rid of by analysing the beam by a Nicor's prism, 80 as to view it by light polarized
in a plane perpendicular to the plane of dispersion. Now on raising the vessel with-
out, removing the prism from the eye, it was found that a dark band, which was 1n
fact the absorption band No. 1, appeared almost exactly in the middle of the bright
red band. On continuing to raise the vessel, 80 as to make the dispersed rays pass
through a still greater thickness of the medium before reaching the eye, the dark

band increased in width, and when the red beam was almost absorbed, the part that
was left consisted of two cones of red, one at each ide of the dark band, which by
this time had become broad. The whole appearance seemed to indicate that the
bright red beam of dispersed light had a very intimate connexion with the intense
absorption band No. 1.
