OF SPORE-PRODUCING MEMBERS. 35

Gl. dichotoma, Thus, in actual size, in thickness of stalk, in position of the annulus,
in convexity of the surface, in fact, in all the dimensions, there is considerable differ-
ence between these two “types. GJ. dichotoma stands aloof from most species of
Gleichenia ; Gl. flabellata, which has been the subject of observations to be detailed
below, holds a middle position as regards size and shape of the sporangium, though as
regards numbers of spores produced, it will be found to be an extreme type.

With these facts before us we pass to the study of development. The sorus begins
to make its appearance in the still tightly circinate pinnule ; it arises as a smooth
outgrowth opposite a nerve (fig. 10), a considerable number of cells being involved in
its origin. Having grown to a height almost equal to the thickness of the pinnule,
it becomes flattened at the apex; in those cases where the sorus is to be a simple
rosette (figs. 11, 12), the convex margin begins to grow out as rounded processes,
which develope into the sporangia. There is some variety of detail, according to the
size of the future sporangium; in the larger type of GJ. cireinata or Gi. flabellata
each process undergoes segmentation, resulting in a conical sporangial cell (:c) ; in this
successive obliquely inclined divisions follow, the earlier of which contribute to form
the relatively massive stalk (figs. 11, 12, 13). These divisions do not appear to be
uniform, as will be seen on comparison of the four corners of fig. 12, and of vertical
sections (fig. 14); the latter also show in the case of these more massive sporangia
