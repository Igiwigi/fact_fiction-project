acquire a farther insight into those invisible mechanical opera-
tions which take place when bodies are heated and cooled.

Finding 80 great a difference in the quantities of calorific rays
which are thrown off by the polished surface of a metal, when
exposed naked to the cold air, and when blackened, I now pro-
ceeded to make experiments, to ascertain whether or not all
those substances with which the sides of my cylindrical vessels
had been covered, and which had been found to expedite the
cooling of those instruments, would also facilitate the emission
of calorific rays from the surfaces of the instruments I presented
to the balls of my thermoscope; and I found this to- be the case
in fact.

As the results of all these experiments proved, in the most
decisive manner, that all the substances which, when applied to
the metallic surfaces of my large cylindrical vessels, had expe-
dited their cooling, facilitated and expedited the emission/ of

calorific rays, I could no longer entertain any doubts respecting
the agency of radiation, in the heating and cooling of bodies.
Many important points however still remained to be investigated,
