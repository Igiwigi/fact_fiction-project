in the same direction throughout, viz., from copper to zine outside the cell, and from
zine to copper inside, except between the zine and acid, where there is a divergence
of tubes in which the induction runs in the opposite way. But a divergence of
negative tubes causes magnetic intensity in the same direction as, and may therefore
be considered as equivalent to, a convergence of positive tubes. The current may
therefore be said to go round the circuit in the same way throughout,

The tendeney to a steady state in which the current or the number of induction
tubes broken up per second is the same at all parts of the circuit, admits of simple
explanation. We know, as the result of experiment given by Onw's law, that O=E
where R is the resistance per unit length and E the electric intensity. Until we
can explain the molecular working of the current, .e., the mode in which the
induction tubes are broken up, we must accept Onn's law as a simple fact. Let us
suppose that we have not yet arrived at the steady state, 80 that in some part of the
circuit the electric intensity is less than in the steady state, while in another part it
is equal to it or greater. Let the steady value of the intensity be E, the actual value
in the former part E', and in the latter E”, By Onn's law the number of tubes
absorbed by the wire per second is given by C'=E'/R, and C"=E"/R, in the two
parts respectively, 80 that C'<C” since E'<F” or less tubes are being destroyed in
the first than in the second part. But all the tubes are sent out from the source of
the energy, and are only destroyed in the circuit, being otherwise continuous and
with their two ends in the circuit. Hence, if more tubes are destroyed at one par
than another, the parts of the tubes not yet destroyed will gather in the medium
surrounding the part where fewer are destroyed, increasing the induction there, and
80 raising the intensity in the wire and therefore the number of tubes destroyed.
