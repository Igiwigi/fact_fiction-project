A when examined by the highest powers made, The subdivisions of all nerve-fibres pass
into fibres which have hitherto been included with the fibres of connective tissne.

The same arrangement with regard to the distribution of the nerve-fibres is observed
here as elsewhere, The fibres of the network are composed of numerous very fine fibres.
Not one individual fibre can be followed for any distance; but certain delicate fibres can be
traced from one compound fibre to another, in precisely the same manner as the coarser
fibres can be followed ina plexus. In fact, from all that T have observed in examining the
finest, branches of the nerve-fibres in various tissues, I cannot but conclude that the general
disposition of these finest fibres is the same_ as that of the coarser trunks and fibres.
In paszing from the trunks towards the ultimate distribution, it might be said that we
