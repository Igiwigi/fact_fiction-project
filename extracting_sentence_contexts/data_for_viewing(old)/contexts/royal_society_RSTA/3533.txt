single photon within the field of view. One contribution from our groups [12,14,15] has been to 1B
use an intensified camera to do exactly this. By reducing the gate time of the intensifier such that =
the gain is large only for the instant of the photon arrival, it is possible to reduce the number Da
of dark events to far fewer than one dark event per frame. The detection of the idler photon by : oy
the single-element detector is used to gate the detection of the position-correlated signal photon, al
and summing over many photon events reveals the image. The time sequencing between idler 1

means that in our configuration the signal photons need to be delayed using an image-preserving
optical delay line. This camera-based approach has recently been configured in a microscope,
