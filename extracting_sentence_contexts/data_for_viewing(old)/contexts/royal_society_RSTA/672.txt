where Ly = )icw, Si is the total spin on a single frustrated unit (e.g. a tetrahedron in the case of a
pyrochlore lattice, or a triangle for a kagome lattice, figure 1), and the variables are n-component
vectors. The local constraints characterizing the ground state configurations are then explicitly

Ly=0, Va. (2.2)

This set of equations can be turned into a conservation law of charges living on the dual lattice
(e.g. in the case of pyrochlore, on the diamond lattice). For that, the original spin variables are
mapped onto fields Bi residing on the links of the dual lattice [8], in such a way that each
component i of Ly is described by the Gauss law: V - Bi\sg, = n(Bq)Li. The factor 7(&q) is a
sublattice-dependent staggering factor: it equals +1 (—1) if the frustrated unit &, occupies the
A (B) sublattice. It is therefore implicitly assumed that the frustrated units occupy a bipartite
lattice. In fact, only in this case is it known how to define the map to the B fields [3] giving the
Gauss law required above.

The constraints, equation (2.2), can then be resolved by an emergent gauge field B' = V x A’.
Furthermore, the spin correlations are recovered by the B’ fields if one imposes a magnetostatic
action for each of them as the simplest ansatz for a coarse-grained theory:

S= * [aexey. (2.3)

This is the prominent Coulomb phase [3,8] action. It has the form of an emergent Maxwell
magnetostatics advertised above, stabilized by fluctuations between classical ground states. Here,
the gauge theory nature of Maxwell's equations comes about for purely energetic reasons—
it follows from imposing the ground state constraint. Adding quantum fluctuations to such
