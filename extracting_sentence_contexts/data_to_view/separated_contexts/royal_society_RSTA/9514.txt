SOUTHWELL ON THE GENERAL THEORY OF ELASTIC STABILITY.

material will never fail. The ‘‘ curves of distortion,” if we could determine their true
shape, would probably be approximately of the form shown in fig. 9. The theoretical
methods of this paper enable us to fix the position of A, the “ point of bifurcation,”
but give no information as to the form of AB, beyond the fact that it cuts OA at
right angles.* The other curves of the diagram will approach more and more closely
the limiting form OAB as the initial value of the amplitude is decreased. In the second case, we have the additional complication of elastic break-down
under finite stress, which reduces the resistance of the material and causes the new
“curves of distortion,” shown by thick lines in fig. 10, to begin at certain points to
fall away from the corresponding curves of fig. 9 (reproduced in fine lines for com-
parison) ; these points will lie on some line such as CD, cutting OA at a point
above A, and it is clear that to the right of CD the curves of distortion refer to
displacements which do not wholly vanish when the load is removed. Total collapse
of the system will obviously oceur at the points of maximum load on the curves of
distortion, and the locus of these points, which is shown on the diagram by the
dot-and-dash line EF, may be termed the “line of final collapse.”
