Deficiency in the quantity of oxygen carried by the blood was thus certainly not
the stimulus. We know also from previous work of Miss FirzGrraup* that the
percentage of hemoglobin may be enormously diminished in the blood without there
being any sign in the alveolar CO, pressure of oxygen want affecting the body during
rest.

The next supposition that naturally occurs is that, though the quantity of oxygen
carried by the blood is not deficient, the partial pressure of this oxygen is abnormally
low. The rate at which oxygen is given off by the red corpuscles passing through
the capillaries of the body depends, not on the quantity but on the partial pressure of
the oxygen in each corpuscle; and if this pressure is diminished shortage in the
oxygen supply must occur. Let us see how far this consideration will help to explain
the facts. We may assume, as was done above, that the haemoglobin of average venous
blood during rest is 64 per cent. saturated with oxygen; also that, as indicated
by the experiments described in Section VIIL., the circulation rate was unaltered on
Pike’s Peak, so that the quantity of oxygen extracted from the blood in each round
of the circulation was the same. The difference between the percentage saturations
of arterial and venous blood would thus also remain the same if the percentage of
haemoglobin were the same. But the hemoglobin percentage was increased by about
19 per cent. in our cases on Pike’s Peak; hence the difference in percentage satura-
tion between arterial and venous blood would only be 82 x 4?§ = 27 per cent., instead
of 32 per cent. as at sea-level. The arterial blood after acclimatisation was 95 per
cent. saturated, as against 96 per cent. at sea-level. Hence the venous blood would
be 95-27 = 68 per cent. saturated on Pike’s Peak, as compared with 62 per cent. at
sea-level. The oxygen pressure corresponding to 62 per cent. saturation on the
