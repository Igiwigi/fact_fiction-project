Tus investigation, of which the results are recorded in the following pages, was carried
out in the Physiological Laboratory of the Owens College, at the suggestion and under
the direction of Professor ARTHUR GAMGEE. '

The elaborate investigations of Roscor had placed vanadium amongst the metals


496 MR. J. PRIESTLEY ON THE PHYSIOLOGICAL ACTION OF VANADIUM,

whose chemical characters and relations have been rigidly investigated ; they had
shown that vanadium is to be ranked as a member of one of the most interesting
families of elements, and yet not a single fact had been ascertained in reference to its
physiological action. The hope that an elaborate examination of the physiological
reactions of vanadium might cas: 80me light upon the relations which may exist
between the chemical and the physiological affinities of elements, and the fact that
Professor Roscor offered to furnish any vanadium compound which might be required,
acted as inducements to undertake this research.

Vanadium belongs to the group of pentad elements, which includes nitrogen, phos-
phorus, arsenic, antimony, and bisgmuth, It would obviously be out of place here to
examine in detail the grounds upon which this relationship of vanadium has been bagedâ€”
as, for example, the analogies between the oxides of nitrogen and vanadium ; the resem-
blance of phosphates, arseniates, and vanadates; the isomorphism of vanadinite and
pyromorphite, &c.
