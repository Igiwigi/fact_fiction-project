£An account of the spectrum of manganese obtained by the oxyhydrogen flame was
epared for insertion in Part I. of this research, but it was omitted for the reason
Ee when investigating the spectrum of the Bessemer flame, I found it necessary to
&mpare the spectrum of elementary manganese under different conditions with that
its oxide. Comparative experiments were made with various alloys containing
Tanganese, and with compounds of that substance ignited in the oxyhydrogen flame.
2 The results showed that the alloys invariably gave a more distinct and extensive
Brice of bands than the compounds containing the same proportion of manganese as
e alloys. Moreover, the bands were always accompanied by lines, and the lines
were stronger in the spectra of the alloys than in the compounds. The principal
lines were always distinctly visible when the conditions were such that the bands
could barely be seen. For instance, when the spectrum of spiegel-eisen was photo-
graphed with a very short exposure, in fact by a mere flash of light, or when steel
containing a very small amount of manganese was burnt in the oxyhydrogen flame
and its spectrum photographed. ‘The various materials used have been ferro-
manganese, containing 80 per cent. of manganese, spiegel-eisen, contaiming 18 to 20
per cent., silico-spiegel, containing 10 per cent. of silicon and 18 to 20 per cent. of

manganese, pig-iron, composition undetermined, and Turtoy’s tool steel.
