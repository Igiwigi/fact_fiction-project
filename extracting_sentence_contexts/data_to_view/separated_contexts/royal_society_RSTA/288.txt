The concentration of a given promoter state is the total DNA concentration multiplied by
the probability of occurrence of that state. If we agree to measure all free energies as differences
from that of the bare configuration, a comparison of (2.2) and (2.4) shows

K ace SPAT (2.5)

That is, the values of the reaction rate constants are constrained by free-energy differences: their
ratio must be consistent with the equilibrium prediction. There is in fact a much more basic
constraint on the kinetic constants. Imagine that the DNA is involved in several complexes. In that case the condition P, =P_, while sufficient to ensure time-invariance of probabilities,
is certainly not necessary.
