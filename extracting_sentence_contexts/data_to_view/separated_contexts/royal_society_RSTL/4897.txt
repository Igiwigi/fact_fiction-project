In air species this Space is
occupied by a fluid; in ALL sPEclts, including the Ophiocomide and Ophiuride,
this fluid penetrates through hollow axes, into the arms and lobes, and air the
membranous processes of the tegumentary system. In aL Echinoderms the 1xTEROR
of the stomach and its dependent cw&ca are lined with vibratile epithelium. This fact
establishes a connection between the Echinoderm and the Medusz, the gastro-
vascular canals of which were proved to be similarly ciliated, whilst it disjoins them
in a striking manner from the Entozoa and Annelida, digestive organs of which, as
will be afterwards proved, are never furnished with vibratile epithelium. The
boundaries of the peritoneal cavity are universally ciliated. A the integumentary
membranous processes are lined within and without with ciliary epithelium, and con-
sist of hollow prolongations of the peritoneal cavity.
