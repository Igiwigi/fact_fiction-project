2 (ﬆXz, y)'(z, wY=0. An fact starting with this equation, if we consider the section by a plane through the
Aine (zx=0, y=0), say the plane y=xaz, then the equation gives

Z z(#L1, aY(z, w/=0; =Zthat is, the section is made up of the line (7=0, y=0) reckoned « times, and of other
Aines in the plane y=az; and the like for the section by any plane through the line
Z2=0, w=0), say the plane z=». Hence the asumed equation represents a scroll of
She order m, having the two lines for an «-tuple line and a P-tuple line respectively,
Sd conyersely such scroll has an equation of the assumed form.
