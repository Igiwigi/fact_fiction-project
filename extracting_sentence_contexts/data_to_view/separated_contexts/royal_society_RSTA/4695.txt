(dW,/dn, + dv,/dn,),
where dn, dn, are both measured towards the surface, the outside medium being
air for which K is unity. The value of the constant A is determined by the cireum-
stance that the aggregate of this volume and surface charge shall be null when the
conductor is insulated and unelectrified, or equal to the given total charge when it is
insulated and charged: when it is uninsulated, the constant is determined by the
position of the point on it that is connected to Earth, and therefore at zero potential. The procedure of Part II., ยง 25 is thus justified, because there is in fact no dielectric
polarization in the conductor, but only ethereal displacement. It remains to consider whether the parts of this volume density p and surface
density o of electrification are carried round with the conductor in its motion, or slip
back through its volume and over its surface so as to maintain fixed positions in
space. It is clear (as in Part II., ยง 27) that the same cause, namely, viscous diffusion
of momentum among moving ions and molecules, which produces OHMIC resistance
to a steady current, will lead to the electrons constituting electric densities being
wholly carried on by the matter whenever a steady state is attained.
