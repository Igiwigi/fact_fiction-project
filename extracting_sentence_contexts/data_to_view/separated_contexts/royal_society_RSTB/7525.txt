This com-
plexity is associated with the presence of a well-developed carotid rete (situated intra-
cranially), which is connected on the one hand to the external carotid system by means of
the ramus anastomoticus and the arteria anastomotica, and on the other to the circle of
Willis by a short trunk which is the only persisting portion of the internal carotid artery. In these species the vertebral vessels are very small at their point of communication with
the basilar artery, and it would appear that the direction of flow in the basilar artery is
away from the circle of Willis. A caudal direction of the flow has in fact been observed in
the sheep in angiograms of the living animal, but in both species this direction of flow is
suggested by the fact that the calibre of the basilar artery diminishes caudally, by the angle
at which the branches of the artery are given off, and by observations made during
decerebration. For this reason, although an occipito-vertebral anastomosis is present, the
occipital artery probably carries no blood to the circle of Willis in these species. The calf had essentially the same arrangements as the sheep and goat as regards the
basilar and vertebral arteries and the vessels which connect the circle of Willis with the
external carotid system.
