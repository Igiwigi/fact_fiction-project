For example, in the forced Duffing system [10], a phase Ss
transition due to a small change in the dissipation parameter may cause a bifurcation [11], which 18

is associated with the collapse of three homology groups to a single homology group in the data
manifold of the phase space, as explained later in the current paper. The fundamental groups of topological spaces, introduced by Poincar√© [12], are the first
and simplest homotopy groups [13], and are algebraic invariants that are critically important
for characterization and classification of topological spaces [14]. Interestingly, fundamental
groups also provide information about the respective covering spaces; in fact, subgroups of the
fundamental groups can be used to classify the covering spaces [15]. Furthermore, fundamental
groups of a base space can be used to construct covering spaces by using the Lifting theorem
[15]. One may think of a base space as the space generated by measurements from m sensors,
and a covering space as the space generated by the measurements from these m sensors in
combination with additional n sensors.
