In many of the free Nematoids peculiar circular markings are met with close behind
'he head, on either side of the body; in others, compressed spiral instead of circular
1arkings exist; whilst in ome, circular depressions or convex projections are 8ubsti-
ated for these markings, in the same region*, TI have examined these structures most
arefully with one of PowELL and LEALAND'S o&;” object-glasses, but could never detect
ny aperture or internal vessel in communication with them ; they seemed to be simple
anrkings, elevations, or depressions of the integument unconnected with any other struc-
are. In the members of the genus Plectus, however, somewhat similar markings exist,
hich are undoubtedly connected either by a minute pore or by a thinning of the inte-
-yment in this situation, with the anterior extremity of a lateral vessel (Plate XXVIIL.
& 14). 'Yt 8eems now to be an undoubted fact that, during the period of growth of the Nema-
prds, both free and paraaitic, a periodical shedding and renewal of the chitinous portion
their integument takes place. This was I believe first recorded by EnrExBERG as
&uwring ,amongst the free Nematoids. Amongst these T also have seen animals
Gonging to several genera with the old integument separated from, though till
ne or less investing the animal, as well as at an earlier stage, when the demarcation
J@ween the old and the new chitine is indicated by a sharply defined undulating line.
