On the other hand, we cannot concur in M. BErTHELOT's view that the existence of
hyposulphite among our analytical results is also ascribable in part to accidental
oxidation of potassium sulphide during the analytical manipulations. These were
carried out with great uniformity 80 far as certain preliminary operations were con-
cerned, which consisted, firstly, in dissolving the residue in water which had been
carefully boiled to expel air, and, secondly, in filtering the s0Jution in closed vesselsâ€”
both of these being rapidly completed operations. The receiving vessel contained
pure ignited cupric oxide, with which, as s0on as the filtering operation was completed,
the solution was agitated until it became colourless,

The fact that in some of the analyses, all of which, we repeat, were uniformly
conducted in regard to the above points, from 3 to 10 per cent. only of hyposulphite
were found, while the proportion of monosulphide in these analyses ranged from 7 to
19 per cent. (being above 9 per cent.
