daily by the tree. The amount required decreases with increasing rapidity as the
tree decreases in height, until a height is reached (10-60 feet) according to the rate
of flow and character of conducting elements, at which the suction of the transpiring
leaves is able to extend to the ground,

The consumption of energy in pumping water upwards must ultimately set a limit
to the possible height of a tree, although this limit would be many times beyond the
height of the tallest tree known. Even in a tree 100 metres high the pumping
action represents a comparatively feeble vital activity, bearing in mind the fact that
a seedling may expend so much energy as to produce 1 per cent. and a fungus
6 per cent. of its weight of carbon dioxide per day. A single human heart doing
30,000 kilogramme-metres of work per day would be able to pump up all the water
required by six trees 100 metres high, the relative weights of the man and the trees
being approximately 1:5000. It is, in fact, the feeble intensity and diffuse
character of the pumping action in the stem of a tall tree, coupled with the
immediate disturbance of the conditions in the vessels when they are opened, which
renders its direct demonstration so exceedingly difficult.

Summary.

The physical conditions in the vessels interpose no obstacle to the exertion of
