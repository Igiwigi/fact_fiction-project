are zig-zag conjugate compositions.

Art. 61. The theorem has an interest of its own, but it is also of vital importance
in this investigation. This importance consists partly in the circumstance that the
functions par

are those which naturally arise in the present theory of permutations. The present
theorem enables the immediate expression of them in terms of the elementary
symmetric functions ae ea ee
and thus they may be more easily dealt with by symmetric functions differential
operators. In fact, the homogeneous product sums

can be made to disappear from the investigation ; but, as will be seen, it is sometimes
advantageous to retain them wholly or in part,

Art. 62. To gain familiarity with the new functions I give without proof some of
their elementary properties.
