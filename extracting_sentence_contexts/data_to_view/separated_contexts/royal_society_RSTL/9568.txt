So much is this the case
Sat while in the tubes of low exhaust we found it necessary to rely chiefly on the
Tects of positive discharges, as they alone rendered themselves plainly visible, we are,
'Z i the case of tubes of high exhanst, compelled to rely chiefly on the effects of negative
A ischarges to guide us in our investigations. + It follows naturally from these considerations that negative-relief is a comparatively
— ninteresting 8nbject of investigation, for all the impulsive diseharges produced
