Material.—A specimen of this species (E.196) from Saul (Meurthe et Moselle) invited
excavation on account of the softness of its infilling; and, although the peristomial
region was somewhat broken, a sufficient expanse of the girdle was found to be intact.
The approximate dimensions of the test are—diameter 45 mm, height 29 mm.

Deseription.—The processes rise directly from the peristomial margin, and are, in
fact, based on promontories of the ambulacra which project into the peristomial circle
beyond its average circumference. The shafts are stout at their roots, and almost
carinate along the sides of the arch. They are very slightly splayed outwards, but
almost vertical. Distally they become very thin, but remain broad, and at the free
edge they expand radially to meet inan arch. The top rim of the arch is feebly thickened,
but I have not been able to decide whether this is a “‘ cap’ or merely an eave. The
top of an arch is 5-5 mm high, a little more than one-fifth of the height of the test.

The ridges rise to almost exactly half the height of the processes, and their character
is modified by the deep and approximated indentations of the branchial incisions. They
maintain a fairly constant height, but show a very slight maximum behind each branchial
