Kiel. When the ice in spring begins to thaw, it disappears quite snddenly, and all the
fishermen along the shore assure you unanimonsly that it sinks. IT have examined a

certain that the ice in spring sinks. TI could, however, not find a single one of them who
had # $pring fished the ice up in his nets, while they very often in auturm and the
beginning of the winter find it at the bottom, and see it rise to the surface*. It was
evident that the sudden disappearance of the ice in spring was the fact which they had
observed, and that the sinking of the ice was the popular explanation of the fact.

The natural philosopher will not allow ice to sink in sea-water, and it seems neces-
sary to find another explanation. In order to give that T must first mention another pecu-
larity with the under-current of Elsinore. I observed on the 2nd of March, 1850, the
temperature of the under-current with a maximum thermometer to be +2:6 C. (36*8 F.)
at the depth of 108 feet, while the temperature at the surface was +1:6 C. (349 F.).

ly in the next spring a friend of mine repeated the observation, and found likewise
Ihe higher temperature in the under-current, the difference being about 2* C. A third
bservation made in summer gave no difference. 'To explain this, T must observe that the
Sater of the Kattegat, at least in its depth, is a branch of that great part of the Gulf-
Stream that passes along the western shores of Norway, and that the under-current at
