first FA and SS support structure modes, as well as the frequencies of the blades modes (table 1),
are almost identical for the two structures; stress resultant demands at the tower base and pile
head are found approximately within the same range, but moment demands at the blade root
are generally higher in the Jacket, with a maximum demand nearly equal to 40 MNm (figure 8)
versus 20 MNm in the Tripod (figure 7). It is evident that these differences shall be attributed
to dissimilar stiffness and mass distributions along the two support structures (table 2) and,
also, to the activation of the second FA and SS support structure modes, whose frequencies are
substantially different in the Tripod and Jacket (table 1).

A final important comment is that, as shown in figures 7 and 8, stress resultant and tower top
acceleration demands generally increase with the PGA, thus meaning that the PGA can be taken
as an acceptable indicator of demand for the structures under study. Because the PGA is typically
related to the short-period energy content of the earthquake, this result reflects the fact that the
rotor modes and second support structure modes (table 1) play an important role in the seismic
response, as shown in figure 4a (periods of the rotor modes and second support structure modes
fall in the region of maxima spectral accelerations) and figures 5 and 6 (activation of the second
support structure modes), in agreement with similar findings for land-based HAWTs [8-10].

(a) Stress resultant and tower top acceleration demands for flexible foundation model

In figures 7 and 8, stress resultant and tower top acceleration demands for flexible FM are denoted
by symbol ‘A’, while grey vertical lines indicate the corresponding demands due to wind and
wave loads only, for the environmental states in load cases LC1-LC2-LC3 (see §3).

At the tower base and pile head, in both Tripod and Jacket, stress resultant demands do not
