the solvent interparticle separation) that is close to unity, a value that produces a kinetic, rather
than the hydrodynamic behaviour at the mesh spacing length scale, leading hydrodynamic
behaviour at larger scales. In the physical macromolecular solutions, departures from equilibrium
are typically mild and the physical Kn varies in the range 0.001-0.5. It should be borne in mind
that the simulated Reynolds number is chosen to match exactly the physical value and in the
subnanometric/picosecond scale the Reynolds number is typically Re < 10-3. The physical Mach
number is typically Ma < 10-5. Given the choice of the simulated Ma number (in the 10-3 to 10-7
range), it is verified a posteriori that the scheme guarantees high levels of numerical stability and
accuracy.

(c) Computational efficiency

Efficiency is a crucial feature of our computational approach due to the fact that water is reduced
to handling a handful of degrees of freedom per mesh node. Given a mesh voxel of ~ 1 A3, when


compared with a water molecule occupying a volume of 27 A3, the cost of handling the single 6 |
mesh node is still much more convenient than handling water explicitly via molecular dynamics

owing to the local nature of the lattice Boltzmann collisions. In fact, aggregating floating-point â€œa
operations with data movements to and from memory, one has to perform about 100 floating point : o
operations per timestep; in contrast, computing forces in molecular dynamics requires about 10 is
times more operations, even for a CG version of the solvent. : Zs
