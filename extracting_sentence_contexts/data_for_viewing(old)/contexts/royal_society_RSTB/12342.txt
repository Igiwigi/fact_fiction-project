Figure 5. Cytograms of water from an eastern North Pacific coastal site (Station M1; 36.754°N; 122.021°W) on 5 May (a,b) and 20 March (c,d) 2014 reveal the complex-
ity of interpreting signals from acidic vacuole stains. FACS targeting putatively phagotrophic protists used green LysoTracker staining (b,d) compared to an unstained
control (a,c). Circles indicate the position of individual sorted cells and colours show taxonomic affiliations for each cell based on the 185 ribosomal RNA gene. Detailed
taxonomy and flow cytometry data for each sorted cell can be found in the electronic supplementary material, files $3 and $4.
