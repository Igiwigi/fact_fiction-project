virtual archenteric lumen. In this respect the condition here manifested is identical
with that seen in text-fig. 11, from Ornithorhynchus. In front of the plane at which
the archenteric “floor” disappears, the “roof” of the archenteron is’ continued
forwards as an elongated axial cellular plate to the anterior extremity of the
embryo. The anterior terminal segment of the plate is shown in the photomicrograph
reproduced in fig. 69. [The sectional figures here referred to should be compared with
the photomicrograph in fig. 72, which represents the surface-view, by transmitted
light, of a Perameles blastoderm identical with the one represented in section in the
figs. 68-71, to which, therefore, fig. 72 will to some extent serve as a key. ]

(h) The “ Protochordal-plate” Segment of the Archenteron.

Examination of the sagittal sections of the Perameles embryo reveals the fact that
for a long distance forwards (viz., about 2°4 millims. measured from the plane of
disappearance of the archenteric floor) the archenteric plate preserves a practically
constant thickness. Ata short distance (0°37 millim.) from its anterior extremity,
however, the plate shows a very definite thickening; the sagittal section of this, its
anterior terminal, segment showing a marked club-shaped form. The clubbed extremity
is terminated cranially by a very distinct convex contour. This contour sharply limits
it from the tissue of the entodermal sheet which replaces it in front. The thickened
anterior segment of the archenteron, thus described, is readily distinguishable in
