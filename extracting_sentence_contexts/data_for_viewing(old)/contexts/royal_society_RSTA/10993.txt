Tuar rocks under the conditions to which they are subjected in many parts of the
earth’s crust become bent and twisted in the most complicated manner is a fact which
was recognised by the earliest geologists, and it needs but a glance at any of the
accurate sections of contorted regions of the earth’s crust which have been prepared
in more recent years to show not only that in many cases even the hardest rocks have
been folded, but that there has often been a marked transfer or “flow” of material
from one place to another in the folds. While, however, these facts are undisputed,
the manner in which this contortion, with its concomitant flowing, has taken place is a

matter concerning which there has been much discussion and a wide divergence ot
opinion. Some authorities—among whom. HEr,* whose work, in Alpine geology
must command the admiration of all, may be mentioned—have held that while, in the
upper portions of ‘the earth’s crust, rocks, when submitted to pressure, will break,
giving rise to faults and overthrusts, the same rocks in the deeper portions of the
earth’s crust are unable to break up in this way, owing to the great weight of the
