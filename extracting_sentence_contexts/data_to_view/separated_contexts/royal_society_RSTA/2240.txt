A comparison of two counterfactual assignments, one might insist, is of no interest. I can see no
convincing justification for imposing this restriction. Using our example (2.4), if one meaningfully
contemplates a counterfactual value of RS when the measurements are factually made in context
c =2, one should also be able to consider counterfactual value of R}: after all, R} and R} are jointly
distributed, it may even be the case that one of them is uniquely determined by the other, e.g. R} = â€”R}. But then, if one can speak of the value that R} would have had if one measured q = 1 in
context c = 1 instead of measuring q = 2 in context c = 2, then one can also speak of what the value
of RE would have been if the same q = 1 were measured in context c = 3.
