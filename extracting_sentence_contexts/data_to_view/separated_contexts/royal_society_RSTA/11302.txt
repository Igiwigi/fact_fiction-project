A smaller thermometer was attached to the stem, with the bulb opposite to the 90°
mark, That the indications of this thermometer actuaily express the temperature of
the tripod and whatever it supports, is proved by the fact that the bands follow it
exactly, their motion being arrested simultaneously with that of the mercury column. The importance of actual contact of the bulb of the thermometer with the interference
tripod has been very exhaustively proved. Mere hanging of a straight thermometer
alongside the chamber, as in the apparatus employed by PuxrricH, affords no
guarantee, especially with a closed interference chamber, that the tripod and its
contents actually attain the temperature indicated thereby.
