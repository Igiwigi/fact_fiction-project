This modified problem achieves its minimum by the direct method
of the calculus of variations. We claim that its minimizer (v,,7;,) also minimizes the original
functional F;,. This follows from the fact that for (vj, @;,) the expression v;, + (r/R - w),)? must
be non-negative almost everywhere (as otherwise one can easily modify (v,,i@,) to obtain a
competitor with strictly smaller energy). Heuristically this is clear, because the relation ij, +
3(r/R â€” @,)? > 0 says simply that the sheet is in tension in the radial direction. This argument
also shows that the minimizer (v;,, @,) is unique, because the modified functional is everywhere
convex, and strictly convex whenever 0! + 3(r/R -wyP>0.
