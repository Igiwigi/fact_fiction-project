that what appeared to them to be semen in the uterus and
tubes, was nothing more than the mucus of the parts. They
further invalidate the force of this argument by contrasting these
solitary observations, with a numerous train of counterfacts;
for in all the experiments made by Harvey, DE Graar, HaL-
LER, and others, it does not appear that semen was found be-
yond the vagina, except in one of Baron HALLEr's experiments
in a sheep, in which he saw semen in the uterus forty-five
minutes after coition. But this fact stands almost alone ; and
when placed in opposition to the many experiments attended
with a contrary result, will weigh but little in the balance of
impartial decision. Yet, however, he rested much upon this
one fact, and adduced it in support of his opinion, that when-
ever impregnation happened, the semen passed into the uterus,

and was retained; but when-it returned from the vagina, then
the animal remained unimpregnated. In this latter case, he
supposes the semen; had never passed- beyond the vagina; for
if it had, he says it would have been retained. This argument
he thinks is unanswerable.
