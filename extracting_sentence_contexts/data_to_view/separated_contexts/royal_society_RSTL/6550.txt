Some differences, however, exist between my
friend and myself, a few remarks on which will not be without their use to those who
may afterwards enter upon this extensive field of inquiry. Experimenting in the ordinary way with his thermo-electric pile—using one of its
faces only—Professor Magxus finds that air and oxygen cut off each more than 11 per
cent. of the heat emanating from his source, while hydrogen cuts off more than 14 per
cent. * 1, on the contrary, with the most delicate means I could apply, failed to esta-
blish the absorption of these gases by experiments made in the ordinary mannerF. In
fact it was their neutrality that drove me to devise the principle of compensation, briefly
referred to at the commencement of this memoir. I was 80 particular in the experiments
which led me to the above negative reult, that if the absorption amounted to one-tenth
of that found by Professor Macxvus T do not think it could have escaped me. Nor do
T think that if such an action existed MnLLoNi could have concluded that the absorption
