and it is readily seen to violate the equality (Vj W2) = (V2W)) (p < 10-7, x? test with d.f.=1). At
the same time, the diagram yields AC = —0.422, no evidence of contextuality. This example serves
as a good demonstration for the fact that while the QQ equality is a sufficient condition for lack
of contextuality, it is by no means necessary.

Considering the question pairs one by one, all but six AC values out of 73 are negative. In
five of these six cases, the QQ equality |(V,;W2) — (V2W;)| =0 cannot be rejected with p-values
ranging from 0.06 to 0.47. Therefore, (3.2) cannot be rejected either. In the remaining case, p-value
for the QQ equality is 0.008, and AC = 0.063. While this case is suspicious, we do not think it
warrants a special investigation: using conventional significance values, say, 0.01, for 73 similar
cases, we get the probability of at least one rejection inflated to 0.52.

Note that in the literature cited, including [26,28], the term ‘contextual effect’ is used to
designate the question order effect (3.4). This meaning of contextuality corresponds to what we
