the ſnow, and its mixing with the nitrous acid. For
as the production of cold depends ſolely upon the
ſolution and mixture, it cannot happen, that this
maſs, which conſtitutes a fluid of a hard kind, ſhould
run into a ſolid conſiſtence, fo long as the ſolution
and mixture continue.

And now, Gentlemen, it requires no ſmall ſhare

this account ſo far: but I have to plead in my ex-
cuſe, that the ſubject of this work is intirely new, and
replete with a vaſt variety of curious facts; all which
exactly fall in with our excellent inſtitution. For who,
before Mr, Braun's diſcovery, would have ventured
to affirm mercury to be a malleable metal? who,
that ſo intenſe a degree of cold could be produced
by any means? who, that the effe&s of pouring
nitrous acid. upon ſnow, ſhould fo far exceed thoſe,
which reſult from mixing it with ice; when ſnow
and ice are produced from the ſame ſubſtance, and
