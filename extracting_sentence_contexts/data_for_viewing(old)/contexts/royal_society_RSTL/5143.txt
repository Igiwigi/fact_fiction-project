polarized ray are symmetrical with respect to the plane of polarization. Hence we
have two directions to choose between for the direction of the vibrations in the
Sreflected ray, namely, that of the incident ray, and a direction perpendicular to both
Sthe incident and the reflected rays. The former would be necessarily perpendicular to
=the directions of vibration in the incident ray, and therefore we are obliged to choose
=the latter, and consequently to suppose that the vibrations of plane-polarized light
Sare perpendicular to the plane of polarization, since experiment shows that, the plane
Sof polarization of the reflected ray is the plane of reflexion. According to this
-Stheory, if we resolve the vibrations in the incident ray horizontally and vertically,
the resolved parts will correspond to the two rays, polarized respectively in and per-
Apendicularly to the plane of reflexion, into which the incident ray may be conceived
Sto be divided, and of these the former alone is capable of furnishing a reflected ray,
Sthat is of course a ray reflected vertically upwards. And in fact observation shows,
Eihat, in order to quench the dispersed beam, it is sufficient, instead of analysing the
Sreflected light, to polarize the incident light in a plane perpendicular to the plane of
Sreflexion.
= Now in the case of several of the beams actually observed, it is probable that many
Zof the particles were really small compared with the length of a wave of light. At
Sany rate they can hardly fail to have been small enough to produce a tendency in the
Spolarization towards what it would become in the limit. But no tendency what-
Es0ever was observed towards polarization in a plane perpendicular to the plane of
Areflexion. On the contrary, there did appear to be a tendency towards a more com-
plete polarization in the plane of reflexion.

M. Banner has been led by the same reasoning to an opposite conclusion
