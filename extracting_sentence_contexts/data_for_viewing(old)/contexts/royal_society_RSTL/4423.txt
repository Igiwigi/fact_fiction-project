fect identity in all its properties.

One of the most remarkable properties of ozone is its destruction by heat, or rather
its conversion by heat into ordinary oxygen. To ascertain the temperature at which
this change occurs, the vessel D, fig. 4, was placed in a bath of mercury, and the gas
examined as it escaped, without previously passing it through the rest of the apparatus.
On heating the mercurial bath, the amount of ozone, as determined by its action on
iodide of potassium paper*, did not notably diminish till the temperature attained
230? C. It till continued, however, very intense till the thermometer rose to 235Â®,
Between that point and 240* the ozone reactions entirely disappeared, when the ozone
was in a very dilute state ; but when more concentrated, slight traces of ozone could
still be discovered, which no doubt would have also disappeared if the current of
gas had been passed very slowly. Time is in fact an element in this action. Even
at the temperature of 100? C. ozone is slowly destroyed. Two similar tubes were
filled, at the same time, and by the same process, with ozone diluted as usual with
oxygen, and afterwards hermetically sealed. One of these tubes was maintained
for three hours in a vapour bath at 100*C., the other was not exposed to heat. On
examining both tubes at the end of the time, it was found that the ozone in the tube
which had been exposed to heat was perceptibly less than in the other, I have no
doubt that, even at the common temperature of the air, ozone preserved in an herme-
tically sealed glass tube would gradually change into common oxygen. I made an
experiment of this kind two or three years ago, which resulted in the disappearance
of the ozone, but I do not remember the source from which the ozone was derived,
nor what precautions were taken to dry the gas.
