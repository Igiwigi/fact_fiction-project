this is U*H ; one of the order 6, this is H*; and one of the order 0, 7. e. an invariant,
this I represent by py. The line (5) shows that there are six asyzygetic covariants of
the degree 5, viz. one of the order 15, this is U-; one of the order 11, this is U*H ;
one of the order 9, this is U*Þ; one of the order 7, this is UH*; one of the order 5,
this is HÞ; and one of the order 3, this is VU. The line (6) shows that there are 8
asyzygetic covariants of the degree 6, viz. one of the order 18, this is U*; one of the
order 14, this is U*H ; one of the order 12, this is U*Þ; one of the order 10, this is

PH; one of the order 8, this is UH®; two of the order 6 (7. e. the three covariants
H?, Þ? and VU? are not asyzygetic, but are connected by a single linear equation or
syzygy), and one of the order 2, this is VH. We are thus led to the irreducible
covariants U, H, ©, Y connected by a linear equation or syzygy between I, Þ* and
V1, and this is in fact the complete system of irreducible covariants; V is therefore
the only invariant.

36. The asyzygetic covariants are of the form U”H'V", or else of the form
U”H'V'®; and since U, H, V are of the degrees 1, 2, 4 respectively, and ® is of the
degree 3, the number of asyzygetic covariants of the degree m of the first form is
equal to the coefficient of a” in 1+(1—2)(1—a)(1—2"), and the number of the
asyzygetic covariants of the degree m of the second form is equal to the coefficient
of a” in a*+(1—a)(1—4)(1—z"). Hence the total number of asyzygetic covariants
is equal to the coefficient of a” in (1+) +(1—2)(1—2*)(1—2"), or what is the
same thing, in
