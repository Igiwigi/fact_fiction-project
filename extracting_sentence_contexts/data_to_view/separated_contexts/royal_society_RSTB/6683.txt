It is not that the plant is less protected, but only that
the contrast between it and the control is less striking. When the X” strain was isolated in 1935 this was substituted for X°. Notwithstand-
ing the fact that it is symptomless on the host plants used, its powers of protection
against subsequent infection with X strains are not only equal to but perhaps more
consistently perfect than those of X¢. The degree of protection depends in the main on two factors:

(1) The age of the plants employed. This applies especially to tobacco; with Datura,
successful protection may be readily secured in older plants.
