One of the first well documented example of inheritance of acquired response to environmental stressors concerns the trans-
generational action of environmental toxins such as endocrine-disruptors (methoxychlor and vinclozolin) commonly used in
the wine industry through modifications of the male germline [61]. In that study in rats, nearly all F1 to F4 male descendants
of FO pregnant females treated with such chemicals showed strongly decreased fertility concomitant with unusual methyl-
ation patterns in the testes. These were transmitted over at least four generations by male but not female gametes despite the
fact that only the FO female received the hormone disruptor [61,62]. Similar multigenerational effects were found with other
contaminants [63]. Furthermore, the expression of over 400 genes in F3 appeared affected by the treatment three generations
before [64], and preference tests showed that F3 females (but not males) of treated FO pregnant mothers (as well as females
with no history of exposure) preferred males whose ancestors were not exposed to endocrine disruptors over males whose
ancestors were exposed three generations before, suggesting that such effects can deeply affect fitness of descendants and
thus the course of evolution [65].
