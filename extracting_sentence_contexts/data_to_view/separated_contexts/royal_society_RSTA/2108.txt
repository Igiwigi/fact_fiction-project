The result of substituting (3.37) and
(3.38) into (3.36) may be summarized as

=o" '(-P(W) + Ba, W) (3.39)
and
Blbar VW) = Gla bu — W) + O(€) terms. (3.40)

The quantity B consists primarily of the coupling term in the lowest-order approximation but
also contains some other terms depending on the unknown quantities. The situation is similar to
the first step, that is, if o and I(w) are determined simultaneously from (3.39) with B supposed
known, then they must be found to any desired precision by iteration. This is in fact possible. Note that o is a 27-periodic function of ¢2, which means that it vanishes by integration over one
period. This condition determines I" as
