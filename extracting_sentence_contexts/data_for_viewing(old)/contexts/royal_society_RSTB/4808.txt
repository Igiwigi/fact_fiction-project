The larvee were obtained at first solely from the mud that had been sent from Baghdad,
but later a certain number of larve were reared from eggs that had been laid in the
laboratory.

The adult females, after pairing, laid batches of about 100 eggs in their brood pouches.
These were shed at the next ecdysis with the cast cuticle. They did not develop
directly, but some did so after the mud into which they had been shed had been gradually
dried, kept dry for several weeks, and then again placed in water.

When the mud first arrived, the number of larvee that could be hatched from it was
considerable, and a large proportion of these grew to maturity. After a few months,
however, the yield of larvee was much smaller and a far smaller proportion survived to
maturity. There was certainly a diminution in the number that hatched, but the fact
that so few survived must be attributed, partly at least, to the fact that the crop of
micro-organisms hatching out with the nauplii became progressively smaller, and hence
the food supply became insufficient. It was attempted to make up this deficiency with
protozoal cultures reared in the laboratory, but without success. The micro-organisms
at first consisted of various flagellates and ciliates as well as bacteria, but subsequently
the bacteria only were evident and these in far fewer numbers.

The youngest stages were very easy to obtain, despite the fact that they were exceed-
ingly minute, as they always collected at the surface of the water at the side of the vessel
nearest the light. This may have indicated a positive phototropism in the larve, as has
been recorded in the case of other Phyllopoda. However, it must be borne in mind that
the larvae may have gathered in the region where the food was most plentiful, the photo-
