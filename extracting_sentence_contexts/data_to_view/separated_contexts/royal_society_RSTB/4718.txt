Ultimately the tubular ccelomiduct outgrowth would
have become unnecessary, and may have disappeared as such. It might very probably
be represented in the muscular guard cells that occur transitorily around the exit from
the end sacâ€”that is, on the above hypothesis, at the junction of. the mesodermal and
ectodermal parts of the gland. In fact, although the sphincter guard cells have not
yet been observed in the maxillary gland of Hstheria, where the efferent duct is still
clearly a ccelomiduct, it is very probable that the ancestral form did possess some sort
of sphincter control to its ccelomiducts, and it is the remains of these that are seen in
the antennal gland. The secretory activity of the ectodermal part of the antennal gland would be
represented in Hstheria by the accumulation of fluid that occurs in between the
distal duct cells, and by the occurrence of the deeply staining rods in the cytoplasm of
these cells. On such a scheme as this, which is figured in text-fig. 6, it is easy to understand why
such diverse reports occur as to the germ-layer origin of the ducts of Crustacean excretory
glands.
