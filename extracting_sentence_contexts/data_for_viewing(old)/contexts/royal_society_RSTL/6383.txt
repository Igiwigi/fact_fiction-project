Up to the 10th measure we find that density and absorption augment in precisely the
same ratio. While the former varies from 1 to 10, the latter varies from 4:5 to 45.
At the 20th measure, however, a deviation from proportionality is apparent, and the
divergence gradually augments from 20 to 30. In fact 20 measures tell upon the rays
capable of being absorbed ; the quantity destroyed becoming 80 considerable, that every
additional measure encounters a smaller number of s|wch rays, and hence produces a
diminished effect. |

With ether vapour alone the results recorded in the following Table were obtained.
Wishing to determine the absorption exercised by yapour of very low tension, the

apacity of the unit-measure was reduced to T%9oth of a cubic inch.
