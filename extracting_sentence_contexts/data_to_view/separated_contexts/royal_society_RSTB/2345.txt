292 DR. D. H. SCOTT ON THE STRUCTURE AND AFFINITIES

anomalum.* In the present memoir it is proposed to give a further statement of the
evidence on which this conclusion is based, to describe and illustrate the structure of
the remarkable fructification in question, and finally to discuss its morphology, and its
possible bearing on the line of evolution of the seed-bearing plants. The fact that an
organ which has hitherto been accepted without question as a true seed, was borne
on a typical Lycopodiaceous strobilus, is a somewhat surprising one, and demands
very careful consideration, if we would avoid being led into too hasty conclusions. The discovery of the strobilus of Lepidocarpon is due to Messrs. G. WiLp and
J. Lomax, who, at my request, published a short joint note on their observations in
the ‘Annals of Botany’ for March, 1900, under the title “ On a New Cardiocurpon-
bearing Strobilus.” The relation of the new cone to Lepidostrobus was recognised by
these authors, who deserve great credit for the discovery, and for their essentially
correct interpretation of it.
