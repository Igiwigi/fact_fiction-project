Free ends can be detected even as far back as
preleptotene, but the mass is then too closely tangled for any one thread to be followed
very far. At early pachytene (fig. 34) this can just be done, and at late pachytene
(fig. 35) it is comparatively easy owing to the fact that the chromosome threads are
not only better spaced but shorter. Now a very interesting fact emerges from a
measurement of the chromosome of fig. 35. Allowing for the two ends being slightly
out of focus the length is 36 mm.
