Defects may arise from faults
signal and induce a specific cell behaviour such as protrusion in any of these systems; to begin the process of identifying
or assembly of a polarized structure such as a cilium. Third, the contributions of mechanical processes to birth defects,
the response might drive a transcriptional response. In fact, we define a range of ‘mechanical’ defects and turn to discuss
all three responses may be simultaneously triggered. We their contribution to structural and functional birth defects.
leave the reader to consider the many diverse potential We propose several general classes of developmental
responses; however, we would note that mechanical, gene defects can result from defects in mechanical processes. In
