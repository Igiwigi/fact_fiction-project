This is certainly true if (3-66) or (3-67) holds.

We have seen then that both #(¢) and G() are solutions satisfying the same initial con-
ditions and having all the properties which they can reasonably be expected to possess.
One therefore wonders whether the solutions are in fact identical, as they would certainly
be if the system were finite. We have shown elsewhere (D, theorems 6 to 8) that the problem
has in fact a unique solution in a wide range of cases. For analytical processes, non-unique-
ness can occur only when

We shall prove in the next section that the solutions F(t) and G(/) do in fact differ for

a certain range of the parameters.
