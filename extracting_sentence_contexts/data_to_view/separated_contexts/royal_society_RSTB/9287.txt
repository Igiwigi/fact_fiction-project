Most of the diversity comes from insertions. Note that the
entropy of rearranged sequences is smaller than the entropy of

0.02 recombination events. This is due to convergent recombin-
ationâ€”the fact that a given sequence can be produced by

0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 different recombination scenarios. Individual B has larger gen-
length of CDR3 (amino acids) eration entropy than individual A, primarily because it has

more insertions. The entropy of productive sequences is
further reduced (by two bits) by keeping only the in-frame
sequences.
