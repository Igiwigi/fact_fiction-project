nses the supernatant liquid to become almost solid, with needles penetrating it in all
Airections. The experiment has been repeated many times with less strong solutions
Wo in open test-tubes, charged and preserved with the simple precautions
dicated by M. GerNez.

It is evident that *supersaturation ” is a term without definite meaning until
further explained. GerNez has shown that a soJution may be supersaturated with
respect to one or both of two different hydrates, 7.e , will crystallise similarly on
contacy with the 8mallest fragment, and not supersaturated at all with respect to the
anhydrous salt, the addition of which causes no effect, De Coregrt has proved
that the 80-called supersaturated solution may be disposed to take up a further por-

— tion of anhydrous salb ; as may, indeed, be inferred from previously known facts, since
