If, however
the hydrogen atoms present in the same molecule be substituted in succession by
chlorine, it is evident from the comparisons given that the effect diminishes as the
number of chlorine atoms in the molecule increases. Compounbs differing by a Carbon Atom.

Tetrachlorethylene . :| 1082 Aldehyde . The different values given by the two comparisons may partly be due to the fact
that the effect of the linkage of carbon atoms among themselves is different from
that of a carbon atom to an oxygen atom, and partly to the effect of the molecular
complexity of methyl alcohol.

2 With the exception of the butyric acids, which of those given aboye are probably
the only liquids containing molecular aggregates, the normal compound has distinstly
he higher woleenlar viscosity: In the case of the Tudlugens aor potiords, the differences
Biminish with the fallin molecular weight; in the paraffins, however, there is no
Begulatity in the variation of the differences.
