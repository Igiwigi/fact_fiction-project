For two spheres colliding with relative velocity qg we find that the virial is
eMq cos 6/2dt at each instant during collision. We have to multiply this by the
chance that, given two spheres A and B with relative velocity q, they shall be in
collision at any given instant. It is assumed that we are dealing with a space throughout which T, is constant,
and therefore the fact that the relative velocity is q, affords no presumption with
regard to the relative position of the two spheres. About the centre of sphere A
suppose a spherical surface described with radius c. An element of that surface is
2rc* cos Asin 6d.
