In the battle of Liegnitz, where Frederick the Great overthrew Landon,
the sound of. the battle was unheard by Field-Marshal Daun, who was posted on a height 44 miles from the
battle-field. Dovys himself recounts the fact of his having failed to catch a single shot + the battle Gs Katzback
at 4} miles distance, while he plainly heard the cannonade of Bautzen 80 miles awuy. 5

The stoppage of the sonnd in the foregoing cases Dovs referred, and doubtless correctly, to the non-homo-
geneous character of the air. He also notes the exceedingly interesting obseryation that in certain clear winter
days, when the sun has already attained 8ome power, the semaphore is difficult to decipher, the reason being
that by the s8vlar warmth upward currents of warm and downward currents of cold air (similar to those of
HrawoLvr on the plain of Antures) are established, and that snch days are also unfayourable to the transmission
of 8ound.
