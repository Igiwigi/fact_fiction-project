But I can find
no ganglia from which they originate, and the external ones undoubtedly pass into the
anterior wall of the body as described: at this point, certainly, there are no ganglia nor
anything like a nervous collar. The trunks themselves are composed of an inner and
an outer tube; the latter is a continuation of the lining membrane of the perivisceral
chamber; the inner is formed of a very delicate membrane, which, by the contraction of
the outer tube, is thrown into longitudinal folds or wrinkles, having somewhat the
appearance of nerve-tubes. 'These trunks, in fact, exactly resemble, in these respects,
the free or isolated portion of the branchio-systemic vein?, which has an outer enyelope
and a delicate internal tunic longitudinally wrinkled. $0 like are the two, that either
might be tigured or described for the other. Having said 80 much with regard to the central organs, it will now be necessary t0
examine the peripheral portion of the blood-system.
