If the Chiroptera are omitted from the calculation (14 Himalayan genera, of
which 2 are not Burmese, and 18 Burmese genera, of which 6 are not Himalayan),
the percentage of Himalayan mammals wanting in Burma becomes 7, and that of
Burmese genera not found in the Himalayas 25°5. Another part of the comparison
in which alteration is necessary is due to the fact that whilst 2 Crocodilians and
12 tortoises are included in the Burmese list, none are Himalayan, there being no
suitable habitat for these reptiles in the mountains. The removal of these would
reduce the number of Burmese Reptilian genera to 68, of which 35, or 51°5 per cent.,
are not Himalayan. The comparison of the residual faunas, omitting birds, would
then take this form :— .
