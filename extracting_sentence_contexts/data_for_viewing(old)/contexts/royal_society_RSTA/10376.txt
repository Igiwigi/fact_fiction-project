Again, the mean vapour-pressure for the whole period did not differ from that for the
sun-spot minimum period by more than 0°001 inch either at Falmouth or Kew. Thus
in these two elements there is less evidence for a connection with sun-spot frequency
than might appear at first sight. As regards the mean daily range of temperature,
whilst all the differences are of one sign, they vary much in size, and the mean from
the 11 years 1890 to 1900 at Kew was smaller than that from either sun-spot
period in (5).

§ 18. In the case of the mean annual temperature, the long-period mean was
intermediate in all three instances between those for the periods of sun-spot maximum
and minimum, and the differences between these two latter means are fairly similar.
The existence of a difference between the average mean temperature of years of
sun-spot maximum and minimum is accepted as an established fact in Hawnn’s
‘Climatology.’* According to Hann’s figures the mean excess of temperature in a
period of four sun-spot minimum years over a period of four sun-spot maximum years,
situated relatively to maximum and minimum as in the case of the Falmouth groups
of years, is for a tropical station no less than 0°55 C., the difference between the two
