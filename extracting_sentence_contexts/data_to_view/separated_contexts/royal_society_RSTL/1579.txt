to contain g27 grains of distilled water, and 654 of another
fluid, the difference will be as 1 to 2; or 634, divided by
327, will give 2 for the quotient. The specific gravity then,
f of the fluid thus found, compared with that of distilled water,
q is properly expressed by the ratio 2,000 : 1,000 ; which latter
| expression is taken for the standard. As it is a known fact that fluids exhibit different specific
gravities at different temperatures, it would have been ne-

S cessary for me to form a table, exhibiting the specific gra-
E vities of fluids at different temperatures, had I not, in order
- to avoid this inconvenience, hit upon a method of bringing the
S fluids, whose specific gravities are to be investigated, to a cer-
= tain standard, viz. to 60 degrees, by setting the bottle with
= the fluid in a glass vessel with cold water, and adding as
Z much warm water as may be necessary to bring that fluid to
'S this standard of 60 degrees. = As the fluor acid will in some measure dissolve the glass,
2 it becomes necessary, when that acid is to be weighed, to coat
5 the inside of the bottle, by melting a little bees-wax in the
S bottle, and turning it, with the thermometer, in such a man-
Z ner that the inside, together with the lower part of the ther-
5 * mometer, may become totally covered when cooled ; which
E coating may easily be removed by means of a little oil of
E turpentine, or any other essential oil, all of which dissolve
E wax very readily.
