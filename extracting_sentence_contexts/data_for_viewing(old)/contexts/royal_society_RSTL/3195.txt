This salt is readily soluble in water. What is chiefly interesting in regard to its con-
stitution and properties is, that the alkaline reaction of the oxycyanide should be fully

* This second reaction is due to the decomposition of the formiate of ammonia by the ageney of the binoxide
of mercury thus: (H C, O, + N Hz) + Hg O, = (NH, + CO,) + CO, + Bg.

destroyed by s0 small a quantity of nitric acid. This fact would seem to show, that
the bicyanide of mercury, and consequently other compounds of the same class, do
really possess something of the characters of the true acids, having the power, if not of
completely neutralizing a metallic oxide, at least of s0 far modifying its basic cha-
racter as materially to weaken its neutralizing action on the oxygen acid.

6. This is further illnstrated by the action of acetic acid on the oxycyanide. A
weak s0lution of this acid dissolves it in large quantity, and if carefully saturated,
the solution gives, on evaporation, a white salt having the odour of acetic acid, which
loses nothing at 220* Fann., but when heated in a close tube, blackens and gives off
eyanogen, metallic mercury, and a strong odour of acetic acid. In preparing this
salt, it is difficult so perfectly to neutralize the acetic acid, that, during the evapora-
tion#, any excess that may be present should not, as it becomes concentrated, decom-
