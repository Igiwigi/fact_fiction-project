Highly complex items are composed of simpler items
along the same trajectory. An increase in cultural complexity
is represented as a climb up the tree, and cultural loss as a
walk down it. This captures the fact that the accumulation
of cultural traits leads to new branching possibilities, that is
new opportunities for cultural diversity.
