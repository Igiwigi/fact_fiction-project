The significance of these oldest drifts will be discussed later. Since
future work might make such a term as ‘oldest’ misplaced, these deposits will be called the
Bubbenhall clay. Two other facts proved by the augered sections are worthy of mention. The hill slopes
are usually covered by a layer of orange loamy gravel varying in its proportions of clay,
sand and pebbles, typically 2 to 3 ft. thick, and clearly post-dating the present valley
topography. It is interpreted as the result of solifluxion, probably during the cold period
represented by No. 2 river terrace or the end stage of No. 4 terrace.
