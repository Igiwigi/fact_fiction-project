a force, n= 7 (Mu) must be applied to it.

This effect on B, due to an increase of the velocity of A, corresponds to the electro-
motive force on one circuit arising from an increase in the strength of a neighbouring
circuit,

"This dynamical illustration is to be considered merely as assisting the reader to under-
stand what is meant in mechanics by Reduced Momentum. The facts of the induction
of currents as depending on the variations of the quantity called Electromagnetic Mo-
mentum, or Electrotonic State, rest on the experiments of FarapayÂ®, FElicrf, &c.

Coefficients of Induction for Two Circuits.

(26) In the electromagnetic field the values of L, M, N depend on the distribution
of the magnetic effects due to the two circuits, and this distribution depends only on
the form and relative position of the circuits. Fence L, M, N are quantities depending
on the form and relative position of the circuits, and are subject to variation with the
motion of the conductors. It will be presently seen that 1, M, N are geometrical
quantities of the nature of lines, that is, of one dimension in space ; L depends on the
form of the first conductor; which we shall call A, N on that of the second, which we
