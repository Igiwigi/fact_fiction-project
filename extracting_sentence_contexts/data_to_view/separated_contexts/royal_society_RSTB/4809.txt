The adult adductor muscle
appears first with the maxillule in the second larval stage. The small anterior mandi-
bular adductor muscle persists throughout life separated from the larger maxillulary
adductor muscle by the dorso-ventral muscles of the maxillule. The fact that in the so-called nauplius the adductor muscle belongs to the mandibular
segment does not necessarily indicate that the shell-fold must also be derived from that
seyment. It is equally probable that the precocious appearance of the shell is a larval
adaptation, and that, in growing forward over the naupliar limbs, the shell-fold has
utilised portions of the muscles, already differentiated in those segments, to serve as
adductor muscles. It will be recalled that in Daphnids and Estheria the shell-folds grow
backwards first of all, while in the Ostracod nauplius the greater part of the shell is in
front of the mandibular segment, the adductor muscle being at its posterior end.
