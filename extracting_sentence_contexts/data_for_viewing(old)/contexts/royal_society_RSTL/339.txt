remained for such a considerable length of time in the heat and
cold to which they were exposed, I flattered myself that the
quantities of moisture remaining attached to their surfaces,
could not be $0 different as sensibly to effect the results of the
experiments.—But, in regard to this last circumstance, I after-
wards found reason to conclude that my opinion was erroneous.

Admitting the fact stated by Dr. Foxpyce,—(and which my
experiments had hitherto rather tended to corroborate than to
contradict,)—l1 could not conceive any other cause for the aug-
mentation of the apparent weight of water, upon its being frozen,
than the loss of $0 great a proportion of its latent heat as that
fluid is known to evolve when it congeals; and I concluded, that
if the loss of latent heat added to the weight of one body, it must
of necessity produce the same effect on another, and consequent-
ly, that the augmentation of the quantity of latent heat must,—
in all bodies, —and in all cases, —diminish their apparent weights.

To determine whether this is actually the case or not, I made
the following experiment.
