There is some speed, therefore, for which
the resistance arising from this cause will be a maximum. If, therefore, the material
* be good conductor and the motion slow, the transference of heat will prevent any
variation of temperature during either compression or expansion. When such was the
case the resistance would increase with the speed, a fact which was very evident when
the rolling took place on india-rubber; for it was possible to give the plane such an
inclination that the motion of the roller was scarcely perceptible, and any increase in
the inclination was followed by a corresponding increase in the speed of the roller. As already stated, there is another cause of resistance ; and this may partly explain the
result : this is viscosity. If we stretch a piece of india-rubber, or any material, when released it does not
immediately come back to its original length, but at. once comes back a certain distance
and then recoyers the rest more or less slowly.
