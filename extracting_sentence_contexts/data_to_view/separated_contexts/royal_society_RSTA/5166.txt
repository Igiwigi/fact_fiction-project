The energies of magnetic vortex atoms would have to be introduced with changed
ign into the modified equation of Least Action, and this will involve the presence in
he modified function of terms containing the electric generalized velocities in the
st degree. Unless the cross sections of the rings are very small compared with
their diameters, there will also occur terms involving products of the strengths of
the vortices and the velocities of the movements of the rings. For two stationary
in rigid cores of very narrow section, the mutual forcive due to fluid pressure will
thus be equal but opposite to the forcive between the corresponding electric currents ;
he general features of this result are in fact easily verified by consideration of the
distribution of velocity, and therefore of pressure, in the steady fluid motion of the

107. The serious difficulty presents itself that the mutual attractions of natural
agnets are actually in the same direction as those of the equivalent electric currents,
and not, as would appear from this theorem, in the opposite direction. In the first
place however, the theorem is proved only for rigid cores, held in the circulating
uid medium, and the forcive in question is simply the resultant of fluid pressures
over the surfaces of the cores.
