In all theories of plastic flow in
isotropic solids such as that of Levy and von Mises’ it has been assumed without
experimental test and sometimes without any explicit statement that the directions of
the principal stresses are identical with those of principal strains. It is difficult to
imagine any other relationship between these directions, but it is worth while noticing
that any departure from isotropy in the material might be expected to falsify this
relationship unless, as in the case of a drawn metal rod or tube under direct load, the
directions of principal stress are identical with the principal directions of the non-
isotropic properties. In the work which will be described later, experiments are carried
out in which the directions of the principal stresses are variable at will and it is proved
experimentally that the directions of the axes of the stress quadric do in fact coincide
with those of the strain quadric. Other Relationships between Stress and Strain.—When the directions of the principal
axes of stress are known the complete specification of stress contains two variables,
which may be regarded as (1) the absolute magnitude of any one of the principal shear
stresses or of any homogeneous function of them, and (2) any one ratio between the
principal shear stresses or between linear combinations of them. The same remarks
