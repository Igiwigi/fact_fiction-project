The bryozoan M. membranacea and the brachiopod N. anomala
display, for instance, this type of development [47,62]. Remarkably, our four-dimensional microscopy approach to
study the earliest embryogenesis of M. mebranacea demon-

strates that there is in fact chiral dimorphism in these microscopy analysis of bryozoan development. All authors analysed
biradially cleaving embryos, with the right-handed form the data. J.M.M.-D. drafted the manuscript, and B.C.V. and A.H.
