to this fact by Dritner,* in opposition to HEtDENHAIN ; but our own studies have
convinced us that both kinds of radiations exist, sometimes the achromatic fibres
appearing to end on the wall, whilst in other instances none could be traced so far,
but all ended in the internal cell-protoplasm. The persistence of the radiations
throughout the equatorial plate stage is worth noting, for in many of the higher
plants this is not the case; and in Pellia, a liverwort in which they are very
prominent during the early and late phases of mitosis, they completely disappear in
this intervening stage. Not improbably the fact is to be correlated with the rapidity
with which the karyokinetic process is passed through in Fucus as compared with
many other organisms. We have already hinted at evidence pointing to this con-
clusion in our remarks on the importance of securing the plants during a certain
state of the tide. The appearances of the mitotic phenomena are such as to bear
out the conclusion, arrived at on other grounds, that in Mucus karyokinesis is asso-
ciated with external conditions, and that these periodically-recurring conditions only
persist for a short time. No walls are produced in connection with either this or
the next nuclear division in the oogonium.

The second karyokinesis follows quickly upon the first, and after it is over the four
nuclei are seen to lie close together in the middle of the oogonial cytoplasm (fig. 7).
They are invested in a peculiarly differentiated mass of protoplasm which in the
