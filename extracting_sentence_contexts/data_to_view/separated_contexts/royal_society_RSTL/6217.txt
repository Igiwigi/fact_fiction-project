As the identical calculi are preſented to the
Fellows of the Royal Society for their inſpeftion,
ſo that the exact fizes, ſhapes, and external forma-
tions, of theſe ſtones may be ſeen; I think it quite
unneceflary to give a written account of theſe par-
ticulars, However, as it may probably give ſome
fatisfaQion to the curious to'be informed of the ſpe-
cific gravities of theſe ſtones, I haye ſubjoined
theſe particulars to this memoir, and have like-
wiſe, for the ſame reaſon, cauſed an engraving of
theſe ſtones to be made, and-added to this paper,

Weight


{ 307 ]

Weight in air, in water, | Spec, gravity,
Large ſtone 308 5| 92 85 | 1.431
Small ſtone 42 35 lo 4 1.326
Both ſtones 350 8 | 102 9 1.415

Qyere, Is it not probable, that the generation of
theſe ſtones might originally have begun in the ure-
thra, as the patient did not ever remember to have
had the leaſt complaint in his loins, or in any part of
his bladder? Or is it more reaſonable to ſuppoſe,
that. the ſtones were firſt of all formed in the kidney,
or urinary bladder, from thence conveyed with the
ſtream of urine, when very ſmall, and lodged in the
urethra, till they had arrived to theſe ſizes ? Either of theſe ſuppoſitions to me appears reaſon-
able, -

However, as hypotheſes of this kind are with dif-
ficulty aſcertained, and as a diſcovery. of the fact,
could it be determinately made, would prove of very
little conſequence to the improvement of the art of
ſurgery, I think it quite unneceſſary to dwell upon a
part of this ſubje&, in which the benefit of mankind
appears to be ſo little concerned,

Plate VIII. Fig. 1. repreſents the-upper parts of
the two ſtones, as they were found lying looſely to-
gether.in the urethra. The longeſt end, that is, the
ſmalleſt of theſe two ſtones, was ſituated neareſt to
the neck of the bladder, or orign of the urethra.
