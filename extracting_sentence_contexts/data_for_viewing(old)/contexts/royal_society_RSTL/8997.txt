Dd description of powder fired from the different guns is almost perfect.

S 8. EFFECT OF INCREMENTS IN THE WEIGHT OF THE SHOT ON THE COMBUSTION AND
SZ TENSION OF POWDER IN THE BORE OF A GUN.

'S In our preliminary sketch of the labours of previous investigators, we alluded to the
S views held by Ropixs and RumyorD upon the rapidity of combustion within the bore.
> The latter, relying chiefly upon the fact that powder, especially when in very large
= grains, was frequently blown unburned from the muzzle, concluded that the combustion
2 was very 8low. Rop1xs, on the other hand, considered that, with the powder he employed,
S combustion was practically completed before the shot was materially displaced ; and
= it is not easy to see why the unanswerable (if correct) and easily verified fact of which
= he makes use has received 0 little attention from artillerists.

A Ronixs, it will be remembered, argues that if, as some assert, a considerable time is
V consumed in the combustion of the charge, a much greater effect would be realized from
V the powder where heavier projectiles were used, but that such is not the case.

S The Committee on Explosives have completely verified the correctness of RoBINs's
5 views.
