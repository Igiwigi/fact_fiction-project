In
the avian heart also, variation in this system has been noted. For instance, Adams
(1937) found that the right A-V ring of Purkinje fibres, which Davies (1930a@) described
in the hearts of a number of birds as establishing connexions between the atrial and
ventricular myocardial components of the muscular right atrio-ventricular valve, was
not present in the heart of a yellow-crested penguin (Megadyptes antipodum) examined
by him; instead, direct myocardial connexions passed across the invaginated epicardial
connective tissue between these two muscular components of the valve. Finally, as between mammal and bird, it may be observed that, size for size, the
heart-rate of the bird is faster than that of the mammal, and we may correlate with
this the fact that the Purkinje ramifications are more extensive in the avian heart,
permeating the thickness of the wall of the atria as well as those of the ventricles, in
order that the impulse for cardiac contraction may be propagated rapidly to all parts
of the more quickly beating bird’s heart. In the mammal, Purkinje fibres have been
described penetrating into the walls of the ventricles only (Cardwell and Abrahamson
1931; Abrahamson and Margolin 1936). It is in the avian heart, therefore, that the
Purkinje system, although having the same fundamental ground plan as in the
mammal, reaches its maximum extent of distribution, and this development is governed
by functional requirements as indicated above.
