from time to time, to look in upon my work, and to give me their views regarding
the evidential force of the experiments. To Professor HuxLEy, moreover, I am indebted
for undertaking the examination of a number of the hermetically sealed tubes. Thirty
of them were placed in his hands, none of them being regarded as defective. A close
examination, however, disclosed in one of them a mycelium. No faultiness could for
a time be discovered in the tube; the sealing appeared to be quite as perfect as that
of its sterile fellows. Once, howeyer, on shaking it a minute drop of liquid struck my
friend's face ; and he 800n discovered that an orifice of microscopic minuteness had been
left open in the nozzle of the tube. Through this the common air had been sucked in
vs the liquid cooled, and hence the contamination. It was the only defective tube of
the group of thirty, and it alone showed signs of life.

The statement of this fact before the Royal Society, by Prof. HuxLey, brought to my
mind a somewhat similar experience of my own. One morning in November I lifted
one of the hermetically sealed tubes from the wire on which it was suspended, and,
holding it up against the light, discovered, to my astonishment, a beautiful mycelium
flourishing at the bottom. Before restoring the tube to its place I touched its fused end
and found it sharp. Close inspection showed that the nozzle had been broken off; the
common air had entered, and the seed of the mycelium had been sown. Two other
instances, one like that observed by Prof. HuxLey, have since come to light. In one of
them a minute orifice remained after the supposed sealing of the tube. The other case
was noticed when the tubes were returned from the 'Turkish Bath. One of them con-
tained a luxuriant mycelium. It was noticed that the liquid in this tube had singularly
diminished in quantity, and on turning the tube up it was found cracked at the bottom.
