THE ELECTRIC AND LUMINIFEROUS MEDIUM. 2385

time was the one developed in voy Hetmuoutz’s early memoirs on electrodynamics,
and it would appear that discrepancies come in through treating the «ther as
polarized like a material dielectric; at any rate his final result (/oc. cit. p. 654)
seems to give the refractive index a value greater than unity for free wether, and one
only infinitesimally different for a ponderable medium. A mathematical investigation
has been given by Lord Raytetcu,* in which the range of density over which these
statical computations are valid is tested by finding for certain cases the complete
expressions in a statical theory, of which they form the first rough approximations.
The result is rather unfavourable to Lorentz’s formula, so much so as perhaps to
excite surprise ai its close agreement with the facts when the range of density is so
great as that between the liquid and gaseous states of the same substance. There
is thus room for the statistical method under which the subject has here been
approached,t in that it explains the wide range through which the formula proves
to be valid as a first approximation ; while it at the same time recognizes that when
the change of density is itself small, but is accompanied by other kinds of physical
change, the influence of the latter on the polar molecule may be sufficiently important
to prevent its exact verification.{ On the specific influence of temperature, cf § 72

21. In thus basing a theory of refraction equivalents on the value of the inductive
capacity, it has been tacitly assumed that the dispersion of the medium is small ;
hence the results apply certainly only in the cases in which there is approximate
