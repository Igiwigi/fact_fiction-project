where p is the number of atoms per c.c. of the substance, and n the number of valence
electrons per atom. Comparison should be made with the reduced band width and
it will be seen that there is, in many cases, a rough agreement. Of course, it may be
objected that the electron-gas theory is at best a very poor approximation to the
facts, and could scarcely be expected to be applicable. The fact that it gives results
which are approximately correct means that the N(£) curves must conform to a certain
extent to the parabolic curve of the simple theory. We have seen in § 3 that with
increasing FE, they actually first rise above it to give ‘peaks’ and then fall beneath

it. Thus we might anticipate that the band widths would be less than the theoretical
values for metals with one valence electron. This, in fact, seems to be the case. The
good agreement obtained for metals of higher valency means that the effect of those
parts of the N(£) curve above and below the parabola just cancel one another.
