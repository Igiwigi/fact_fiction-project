On all occasions when the soil was penetrated, the progress of excavation was stopped,
except in the second shaft at the colossal statue, by filtration water, after which
the further examination could only be made by borings. "This impediment I did
not anticipate; and I fear that it must ever be found a great obstacle to any satisfactory
ascertaining of the nature and depth of the entire amount of Nile sediment in any sec-
tion of the valley. It is a well-authenticated fact, that no wells can be sunk with any
certainty as to the depth at which water will be found, in any part of the valley, even
within a comparatively limited space. 'This irregularity in the levels must be caused to
= great extent by differences in the degrees of permeability and power of retention in
D the soils; but it will be seen, on examining the sections in the instances quoted above,
Z that the oils of the different pits are very much of the same Kind, and it is not very
S likely that there would be great changes in the intervening spaces.

THE RATE OF SECULAR INCREASE OF THE ALLUVIAL LAND.

I shall now proceed to consider the geological conclusions which appear to me to be
= fairly deducible from the facts which these researches have disclosed, with reference to
the object for which they were undertaken, viz. to endeayour, by digging deep into the
