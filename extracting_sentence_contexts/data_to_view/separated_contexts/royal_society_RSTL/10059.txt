The ventricle in the posterior part of the cerebrum is not divided behind inf

Ganoids as a group ; but, curiously enough, the only characters amongst the whole
series which have been given, which can be regarded as peculiar to the Ganoids, are
(1) the characters of the brain, and (2) the fact of the oviducts and kidney ducts
uniting together and opening by a common pore to the exterior. This absence of characters peculiar to the Ganoids is an indication‚Äù of how widely
8eparated in organisation are the different members of this great group. At the same time, the only group with which existing Ganoids have close affinities
is the Teleostei.
