In regard to the identification of these fibres, it may be well further to state, that
their separate existence is indicated chiefly at the postero-lateral margin of the gan-
glia, (fig. 7. f) where they are scen to form part of the nerves and cord without passing
upwards to the brain. In other parts of their course they are not distinguishable by
colour, and very rarely by any longitudinal line of separation from the fibres which
form the inferior longitudinal series, or portion of the cord, to which they are ap-

proximated ; but from which they are believed to be distinct from the fact, that they
do not ascend with them to the brain. Their function must be regarded only as
