The minimum value occurs at about 8 per cent. NaOH, and in a 50-per cent. solution the intrinsic conductivity is nearly half as
great again as in the most dilute solutions. This increase of conductivity we
attribute to the fact that sodium hydroxide is an autolyte, that is to say, an
electrolyte when fused, and may therefore be able in concentrated solutions to
conduct the current quite independently of the ionising properties of the
solvent. Although it was obvious that the conductivity of concentrated aqueous salt
solutions might be in part autolytie, we had hitherto been able to obtain no direct
experimental evidence in support of this view. The case of sodium hydroxide is,
however, especially favourable for the observations of this property, since its high
solubility and low melting-point combine to produce in the concentrated solution a
condition approximating unusually closely to that of the fused salt.
