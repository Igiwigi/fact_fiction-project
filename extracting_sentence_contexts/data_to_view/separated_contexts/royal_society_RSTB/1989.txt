In the next two experiments the larvee
Swere of a distinctly Strongylocentrotus type, but still showed some traces of their

ixed parentage. Also they were rather irregular in size and form, a few of the larvee

aving a short second skeleton in the anal arm, and others of them being of a dwarfed
form, _ In Exps. 126 and 141 the larve were of the Strongylocentrotus type, but had
prickles projecting from the body skeleton. They were, in fact, of the same type as
the reciprocally crossed hybrids in Exp. 129. In Exp. 142 the larve were again
irregular in size and form, double anal arm skeletons being fairly common. In the
next two experiments the larve were chiefly of the Strongylocentrotus type, but some
of them approached the intermediate form.
