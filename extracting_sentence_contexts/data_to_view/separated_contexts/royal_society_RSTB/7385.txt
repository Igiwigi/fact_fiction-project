Had he been alive he might have modified
his views in accordance with later information. In a letter to me (1928) Van Nouhuys writes that, when he was with the Lorentz
expeditions of 1907 and 1909-10, he was struck by the fact that the natives of the
Lorentz river and its tributaries were absolutely ignorant of the use of tobacco and
betel, which was in strong contrast to the Péségém, on the southern slopes of the
Central Range, who smoke their home-grown tobacco, mbali, though they do not chew
betel nut, which, however, is done by the Timorini and Baliem on the opposite
northern slopes, where locally grown tobacco is called tavo. He considers the word
mbali as belonging to the purer Papuan language, whereas the northern tribes accepted
the term favo; which is nearer to the name of the imported tobacco; for tobacco has
always been in strong demand along the northern coast of New Guinea. He is con-
vinced that at the time of the early voyagers, tobacco came from the interior of New
Guinea to the north coast.
