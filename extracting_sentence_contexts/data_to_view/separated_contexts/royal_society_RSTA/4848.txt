= This agrees as well as can be expected with the observations of other observers on
Fhonectne sulphur, The fact that the melting-point of monoclinic sulphur, even when
‘at has lost its crystallographic properties, is about 120°, may be taken as established
By these observations. The want of sharpness in melting-point, which is to be
Roticed even in the case of monoclinic sulphur, is marked in all the samples we have
Sxamined, and is on the whole more pronounced when we deal with mixtures, but not
goarkedly so. We think it is established that sulphur, like selenium, has not a
erfectly sharp melting-point—another point of resemblance between these sub-
tances which we have not seen noticed.
