J ilus is not so limited, and, as above explained, there is good reason to believe
chief vegetative region of these plants is the result of sterilization of the

Swe conclude that the case is similar to that of the Selago type of Lycopodium.
Tsoetes may be regarded as a simple strobilus of which certain sterile leaves

gbilus is the counterpart of a sporogonial head : in function and position the
dence is usually plain enough : the structure, external form, and details of

dence is apparently less close in proportion as the appendicular organs are of
ly larger size.
