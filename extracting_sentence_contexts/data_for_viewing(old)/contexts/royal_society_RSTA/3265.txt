where Ly is the latent heat of phase transition, ga(t) is the solid fraction at z=a(t), km(ga) =
ka + k\(1 — Ga), ks and ky are the thermal conductivities of the solid and liquid phases, Dm(¢,) =
D\(1 — gq), and Dy is the solute diffusivity. Here, we assume that the thermal conductivity of the
mushy layer, km(y) =ksg + k\(1 — ¢), is the volume-fraction-weighted average of the properties
of the liquid and solid phases [10,33-35].

In the case of heavy oceanic currents, the boundary conditions at the mushy layer—liquid phase
interface must be written down accounting for the fact that the heat and salt fluxes in the liquid
phase (ocean) are strongly dependent on turbulence (convective mixing in liquid) [25,36,37].
Taking this into consideration, we get

where a, and as are the turbulent transfer coefficients for heat and salt, p; and c are the density
