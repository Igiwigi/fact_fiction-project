THE ADULT STRUCTURE OF THE STARFISH ASTERIAS RUBENS, L. 277

to an anterior region of the stomach wall (p. 262). The position of the adult anus
in inter-radius I/V separates the ray I structures from the ray V_ structures,
associating the former with those of ray II, a ray which certainly belongs to the
anterior portion of the series.

These facts strengthen the evidence provided by the nine-rayed sun-star Solaster
endeca (29, pp. 28, 29). Here the four extra rays are developed one by one in order
from ray V onwards, so that we cannot but enumerate the series as beginning with
pouch I. This view is still further confirmed by evidence from the double-hydroccele
larvee of Asterias (p. 275), one of which underwent metamorphosis, producing a bilateral
“starfish” with a right and left set of hydroccele pouches, the two pouches I being
on opposite sides at the anterior end of the animal.

It follows from the above that inter-radius I/V is morphologically both the most
anterior and the most posterior of the inter-radii. The first and last of the rays,
viz., rays I and V, have become approximated like the outside radii of an almost
fully opened circular fan, ray V undergoing the principal part of the movement.
This inter-radius contains the adult anus, and although the adult mouth is central,
