8equently to realise the conjecture that the enormous dilatation which occurred instan-
taneously could have been caused by increase of temperature. On the other hand the
ascertained facts appear rather to point to the phenomenon being caused by the pro-
jection of the gas-molecules by electrification againsb the walls of the glass vessel,
producing thereby effects of pressure, which, however, are distinct from the molecular
motion induced by heat. Recently (July 5th, 1879), Professor DEWAR called our attention to a similar phe-
nomenon, which confirms this view. He was working in the chemical laboratory of
the Royal Institution on the Electric Arc, the source of electricity being a SIEMENS?
dynamo-machine driven by a gas engine.
