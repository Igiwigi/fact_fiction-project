Thus respiration is the combined act of the sensorial nervous
and mnscular powers. It is as effectually destroyed by a failure of the sensa-
tion which makes us will to inspire, as by that of the nervous or muscular
power by which the will effects its object. With this view of the subject be-
fore us, and I can see no other which the facts admit of, it will be proper to
examine the nature of respiration more in detail. T have already had occasion to observe, that the effort made in ordinary
breathing is very slight. It is chiefly performed by the diaphragm, by the con-
traction of which the cavity of the chest being slightly enlarged perpendicularly,
the pressure of the atmosphere readily causes the air cells to be distended with
air; but if any obstacle occurs tending to prevent the passage of the air to the
cells, a greater effort is required, and other muscles are called into action.
