do not take place, unless at a very high temperature. But, in the presence of water
vapour, action goes on readily and the final products are the substances represented
on the right-hand side of the above equations. Now these actions can all be
explained on similar lines to those already put forward to explain the formation of
the C,H,;Br molecule. The distinctive character of the explanation is in the
assumption that an additive complex molecule is formed at first before the final
products are obtained. In most gaseous actions of this type water vapour is a
necessary condition of the progress of the reaction. Now there is no molecule which
shows a greater tendency to form additive compounds than water. This property is
seen in the molecular species which contain water of crystallization. Brit has
investigated many other “unsaturated” properties of water and attributes them
to the quadri-valency of oxygen, but for our purpose all we need to recognise is
the fact that the water molecule tends to form molecular compounds. The part
played by the water in a gaseous action we can suppose as follows: The gaseous
substance which takes part in the action can unite with the water molecule directly
forming a molecular compound. This new complex molecule can then exist for some
time, during which its component atoms can re-arrange themselves, so that an internal
settling down to equilibrium takes place. In this process a group of atoms may form
a part of the whole molecule, which has little attraction for the rest of the molecule,
so that it may split off and give rise to a molecule of the final product. We have in
effect in this scheme an intermediate compound, but we recognise the possibility of
this compound being not capable of isolation, and in many cases so unstable that its
own existence may be practically for an infinitesimally short time.

Such a theory as the one now put forward requires direct evidence as to the
