For negative values of s, the numerical values of A(s), D(s), and
E(s) are the same as for the equal positive values of 8: the signs of
A(s) and D(s) are the same for the positiye and negative values of s,
but the signs of E (s) are different. AN APPARENT NEW POLARITY IN LIGHT, 233

The first remark which presents itself, in looking at this table, is, that the numbers
D (s) and E (s) increase and diminish, and then change signs and increase and
diminish, with increasing values of s; that the maximum of one always coincides
nearly with the vanishing point of the other ; and that the maximum values are nearly
equal in both series (regard being had to the general diminution of the numbers as
5 increases) ; in fact, that these numbers may be represented as the cosine and sine
of the same arc, the radius being slowly variable. To prove this, let ns make D (s) = G(s).cos © (s), E(s) = G(s) sin © (s), and investigate the values of G (s) and
© (s) for every value of s in the Table.
