This excitation of the augmentor centre is frequently
followed by vagus action, with slowing or irregularity of the ventricles. If, again, we
stimulate the centripetal fibres contained in such a nerve as the sciatic or splanchnic,
we get also augmentor effects on the heart, as well as the constriction of certain
vessels, resulting from the action of certain vaso-motor nerves. The meaning of these
facts appears to us simple enough, namely, that when the supply of blood to a part
