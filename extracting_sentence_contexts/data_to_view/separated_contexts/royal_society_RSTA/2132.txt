Another interesting
feature is the great excess in the number of D.Q. occurrences on day 81 over that on
day 108. The number of occasions when Q days follow 81 days after D days of the
highest class is quite outstanding. Another interesting fact is the considerable difference between the results from day
— 27 and day + 27. A tendency in the most disturbed D days to be the second rather
than the first member of a sequence is consistent with the relatively large size of the first
subsequent secondary pulse mentioned in § 5. §14.
