pigmented leaves, fruits and flowers, are shown in Tables IV, V and VI respectively.

FLOWERS

The majority of the plants whose flowers have been examined are those commonly
grown in gardens. They have therefore been subjected to selection towards the extremes
of colour, thus favouring an excess of pelargonidin and delphinidin types at the
expense of cyanidin. In spite of this the figures clearly illustrate the predominance
of cyanidin. The frequency of occurrence of the three types, expressed in terms of
percentages of the total numbers of orders, families, genera and species examined,
is shown in Table VII and fig. 1. The effect of artificial selection is demonstrated by
the fact that while over 50Â°%, of the species examined contain delphinidin derivatives,
yet as the scope of the subdivisions is increased to genera, families and orders cyanidin
proves to be the more widespread.
