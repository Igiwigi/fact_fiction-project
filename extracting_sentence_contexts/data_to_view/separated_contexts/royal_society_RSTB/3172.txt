206 MR. R. ASSHETON ON THE MORPHOLOGY OF THE UNGULATE PLACENTA, AND

respects the character found in the sheep, more especially in the mode of destruction
of the uterine epithelium and in the close application of the trophoblast to the
maternal tissues (VERNHOUT (109) ).

D.—Eptrome. The following facts are the chief additions made in this paper to our knowledge of
the morphology of the mammalian placenta :— . 1. An account of the development of the placenta of a ruminant (the sheep) which
is shown to occupy a position approximate to the deciduate type of placentation—

(a) The trophoblast shows a distinct tendency to form two layers which are
compared to the plasmoditrophoblast and cytotrophoblast of the deciduate
type.
