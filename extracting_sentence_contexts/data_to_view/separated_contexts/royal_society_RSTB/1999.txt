Also on dividing up the values into two groups, it is found that ova with an average
diameter of 11°33, produce larvee averaging 17°10 in body-length, and ova of 11°72
larvee of 17°67. We see, therefore, that in every case the average values for the size
of ova and of larve more or less correspond ; but as the individual values show con-

iderable variations, there are obviously other factors at work as well. With reference to the two values for Echinocardiuny ova, it will be noticed that
that of E. mediterraneum is considerably less (10°7 per cent. in fact) than that of
E. cordatum, the five days’ plutei being also 11:2 per cent. less in body-length. Now
