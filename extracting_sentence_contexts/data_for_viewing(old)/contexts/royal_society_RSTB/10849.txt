SMARCAS has been implicated in the RNF168 signall- RPA and RAD51 at DSBs, suggesting that it affects HR by regu-
ing cascade at DSBs. It interacts physically with RNF168 lating end-resection [74,75] (figure 2). However, how SMARCA5

Figure 2. Model for the role of chromatin remodellers in HR-mediated DSB repair. INO80 is recruited to the DSB and ejects histones H2B/H3/H2A.Z in close proximity
to the lesion. Subsequently, CHD1 is recruited and opens chromatin around the DSB to promote CtIP loading and initiate DNA end-resection. Next, SMARCAD1
recruitment aids in passing the 53BP1-induced chromatin barrier and stimulating EXO1 and DNA2-dependent end-resection for efficient assembly of HR factors
(BRCA1, PALB2, BRCA2 and RADS51), the latter of which is facilitated by SMARCA2, SMARCA4, SMARCAS and CHD4 chromatin remodelling.
