It follows that the equator will still be one of the free stream-
lines, but the motion elsewhere may be totally different from what it would be if the
density were the same throughout. It seems probable then that’ the result we have
obtained with reference to the tendency of the currents to set along the equator will
still hold good even when the density is variable, and this conclusion is borne out by

observation, it being noticeable at a glance at the Admiralty current charts that
there is no tendency to cross the equator except in the immediate neighbourhood of
the coasts.
