We found that with the best vacuum we could obtain, even with the addition
of phosphoric anhydride drying tubes, our specimens always tarnished if kept at a
red heat for any length of time. We are inclined to ascribe this to the action of
gases occluded in the metal and given out on heating. The tarnishing, however,
was not very rapid, and a specimen could safely be heated up to bright red once before
it became noticeable. This enabled us to make observations which very clearly showed
that, even with the greatest experimental refinement, we could not hope to observe
the process of re-crystallisation microscopically. We have found that if a strained,
polished and etched specimen, showing distinctly elongated crystals, be gradually
heated in vacuo no change whatever is visible in the outlines of the crystals; on
removing the specimen from the apparatus it is sometimes found coated with a thin
blue tarnish, and on examination with the microscope it is seen that this tarnish has
not obliterated the original crystals, but in fact differentiates them by various
colours on different crystals, If this tarnish be now polished off, as may easily be
done by the use of rouge alone, and the specimen be re-etched, an entirely new set
of crystals is revealed, This was readily established by drawing the outlines of the
original crystals at a marked spot on the specimen before and after the light
re-polishing. Simple re-polishing and etching a similar specimen, without annealing,
produces only very small changes in the pattern. We may therefore conclude that
in the above experiment the iron did re-crystallise when at a red heat, but that this
re-crystallisation did not immediately affect the pattern on the surface. The
explanation is obvious when we realise that the pattern seen in the microscope is
due to the differences of level and texture in the surface of the specimen which have
been produced by the action of the acid used in etching. This pattern, although
in its origin dependent upon the actual crystalline structure of the metal at the
