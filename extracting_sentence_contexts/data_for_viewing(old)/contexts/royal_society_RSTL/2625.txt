circurſlances. It is obvious, that: both theſe methods tend
not ouly to prove the fact, but likewiſe to diſcover the quantity
of hear { abſorbed ; and that the latter alſo, if the operation
be reverſed, will ſhew the quantity of heat evolved, when a |
fluid congeals or becomes ſolid. In this way Dr. BLACK efti- |
mates the heat in queſtion to be equal to 1 40 degrees upon FAH- |
zExuglT's feale; Profeſſor wit.cxe, by a great variety of ex-
periments with different proportions of ſnow and water, brought
it out pretty uniformly about 1303 and Mr. CAVENDISH, as he |
hath lately informed us, finds it amount to 150, and chooſes to
call the proceſs a generation of heat or produCtion of cold *,

freezing point of quicklilver depends entirely upon this gene- 7
ration, re-appearance or evolution-of heat, by means of which |
