spots, circles and crosses in the figure suggest diagrammatically the behaviour of the
functions p; (x, x), i = 0, 1, 2, in the sense that the number of spots included in any
region w is proportional to the integral of py (2, v2) taken over this region, etc.
Looking at the diagram we see that, if the process of sampling was repeated many
times, then, were the hypothesis Hy true, most sample points would lie somewhere
near the point O. On the contrary, if H, or H, were true, the sample points would
be close to O in comparatively rare cases only.


THE MOST EFFICIENT TESTS OF STATISTICAL HYPOTHESES. 297

In trying to choose a proper critical region, we notice at once that it is very easy to
control errors of the first kind referred to above. In fact, the chance of rejecting the
hypothesis Hy when it is true may be reduced to as low a level as we please. For if w
is any region in the sample space, which we intend to use as a critical region, the
chance, Py (w), of rejecting the hypothesis Hy when it is true, is merely the chance
determined by H, of having a sample point inside of w, and is equal either to the
sum (when the sample points do not form a continuous region) or to the integral
(when they do) of pp» (2,, v2) taken over the region w. It may be easily made = ¢,
by chosing w sufficiently small.

Four possible regions are suggested on the figure ; (1) #,; (2) we, 7.e., the region to
the right of the line BC; (3) ws, the region within the circle centred at Ag; (4) 4,
the region between the straight lines OD, OE.
