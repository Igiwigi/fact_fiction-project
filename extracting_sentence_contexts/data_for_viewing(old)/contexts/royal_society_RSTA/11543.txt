Hence, both experiments were made with increasing reversals of magnetisation. Also,
since during the reversals of magnetisation the magnetic stress is alternately applied
and removed, the weight used in measuring 81/8P was added and removed several
times before readings were taken, An initial weight of 1 kilogram was always kept
in the scalepan and the effect observed at several fields of adding a few kilograms,
the magnetisation being measured before and after the additional load was applied.

An increase of tension always caused a diminution of magnetisation, which was not
in general proportional to the weight added.* [Added May 15.—This depends on
the field-strength. At low fields, within the range of tensions used in the present
experiments, the effect of tension in reducing magnetisation diminishes slightly as
the tension is increased, at stronger fields the opposite is th ecase ; in other words, at
low fields 6°I/AP* is positive, at high fields negative. This may partly explain the fact
observed by Brpwett that at low fields increase of tension diminishes the magnetic
contraction in nickel, at high fields increases it. For if part of the contraction is
represented by

—e=1}H Pa?
then

which is negative at low, positive at high fields.] It could, however, be assumed that
the change of magnetisation, divided by the increase of tension per unit area of section
