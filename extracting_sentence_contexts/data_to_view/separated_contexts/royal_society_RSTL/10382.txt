The produce
vas always ready to be cut much earlier than that on any other plot ; the stems being
Zgenerally ripe, and eyen dead at the bottom, before the herbage on most of the other
Splots was ready for cutting. Owing to this, and to the most prominent plants flowering
And seeding early, and frequently shedding seed before cutting, their permanence was
Sfavoured. This was especially the case with Bromus mollts, which frequently produced
- Szeed in the first growth, and gave an abundance of seedling plants in the second, On
-Sthe other hand, the fact of this plant being usually annual, or biennial only, may serve
to account for the great fluctuation in its degree of prominence in the different seasons,
Edependent presumably on the climatal cireumstances having been favourable or other-
Size for its reproduction and persistence. Again, the fact of the occurrence of tubers
Zon the roots, which has been observed in this plant on this plot, may perhaps be taken
Eto indicate a tendency to assume a perennial duration. EZ
