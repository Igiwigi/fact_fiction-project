be lifted up like a tongue, and replaced in its normal position within the background at
pleasure; on 8moothing the part so cut out, and causing it to occupy its original place,


the bright line was apparent, but it disappeared when the crescent was lifted up, and a
sheet of white paper was interposed between it and the dark ground of the photograph.
These phenomena occurred when the photograph was examined with the naked eye,
with the aid of spectacles, or, from a short distance, with a sharply defining telescope by
Ross. Viewed in either of these ways, the brightening was found to begin immediately
beyond the edge of the white paper as it was introduced more or less under the crescent.
For the purpose of illustrating this paper on the occasion of its being read before the
Society, TI prepared a representation of one of the photographs of partial phase, 3 feet in
diameter, in which, bearing in mind the well-known fact that there is on the solar disk
a gradual diminution of the intensity of the light from the centre to the periphery, T
Searefully reduced the brightness of the solar crescent in due gradation towards the con-
Sex boundary. In the first instance the background was not painted in, and I expected
Shat when it was completed a brightening would immediately occur. Such, however,
Swas not the case.
= On calling Professor STokss's attention to this failure in producing the phenomenon
>f brightening by artistic means, he suggested that I should renew the attempt by using
Ãž real photograph of the sun and a dark disk for the moon*. On this plan I sneceeded
Zn making eclipse-pictures artificially, which showed the brightening very distinctly.
From these experiments I am inclined to believe that Mr. Arry's explanation is the true
ne, although it is a curious subjective fact that the parts possessing superior illumina-
he exhibit to our perception an extremely bright line, bordering immediately on the
