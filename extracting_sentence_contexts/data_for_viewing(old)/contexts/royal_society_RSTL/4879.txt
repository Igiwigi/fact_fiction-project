the explanation and illustration of natural phenomena, it may be ;
8aid in respect of declination, that the helix being above the needle "
in a plane having dip, and therefore above its magnetic equator, if *
on the east of a needle having north dip, it will send the south or
upper end west, or if on the east of a needle having south dip (being : :
of course then itself inverted (2972.)), it will cause the north or : i [
upperend to pass westward ; seeming to repel the end of the free needle or part of the
line of force nearest to it. In reference to the inclination, it may be said, that the helix
being above the needle, tends to 8end the upper end of the needle or line of force from
it. If the helix is north of the magnetic axis, it will tend to send the upper end of the
needle south ; if it is south, the upper end will go north. As in the case of the decli-
nation, it is as if the end of the free needle or line of force nearest to it was repelled.
In fact every case is included in this result, that if the helix be diamagnetically
adjusted (2975.) for a free needle, whether it is above or below the needle, or on this
side or that, the nearest end of the needle will be as if repelled, provided the helix is
not in a neutral position.

2994. I repeated all these experiments with the helix reversed, $0 as to give the
effect of a paramagnetic globe of air (2865. 2973.). I need only say, that the effects
were precisely the same in nature and order, only in the reverse direction. They will
be required in the explication of the night and early morning actions, due to the
cooling of the atmosphere (3003. 3010.).

2995. In these experiments, that the laws of deflection might appear in their
simplicity, the needle was suspended in the air, and the representation of the sun's
