et al. 2006). In these locations, unsustainable harvests
have led to declines in wild food species.

The illegal use and trade of bushmeat is well docu-
mented. In the long term, over-harvesting will have a
negative impact on wild food availability and thus on
nutritional security for those communities that rely
on bushmeat for protein. In some parts of Africa,
unsustainable harvesting is putting added pressure on
stocks. An important driver is the widespread avail-
ability of firearms (Jaarsveld et al. 2005).
Nevertheless, despite the fact that unsustainable
trade in bushmeat is regarded as a threat to wildlife,
Cowlishaw et al. (2005) found some evidence of sus-
