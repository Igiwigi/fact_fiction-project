In making this enumeration we have concentrated rather on the effect upon
the axial skeleton, ignoring the occurrence of all minor differences in position
of the individual limbs. One reason why it is incumbent to single out these attitudes
as entities (even though the two asymmetrical forms often combine one with another)
is that it is characteristic of horizontal canal stimulation to induce lateral curve and
of asymmetrical vertical canal stimulation to induce spinal torque. Of special
interest is the fact that any sideward lean of the head (relative to the plane of the
substratum) invariably involves spinal torque. Destruction of Both Labyrinths

Observers have vied with each other in attempting to describe the disabilities of
movement associated with this operation in the frog. From our present point of
view, the outstanding fact is that its ability to hold any stationary posture is
untouched.*
