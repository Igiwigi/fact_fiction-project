In this set-up, the length of the dopant section is not constrained as in the example
shown in ยง2b. Therefore, it is expected to have continuous injection at the back of the cavity until
the accelerating fields are fully saturated. In fact, this effect is observed in the simulation for the
electrons ionized from the second level of helium. However, due to the cavity elongation during
the focusing, these electrons are being trapped behind the previously injected beam, and, thus,
they do not overlap time nor influence the quality of the primarily injected beam. Figure 5b shows
the combined longitudinal phase space of the driver and the injected electrons, after 1.8mm of
propagation.
