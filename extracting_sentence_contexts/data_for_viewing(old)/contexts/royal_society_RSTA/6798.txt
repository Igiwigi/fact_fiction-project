to the right-hand side of (1). Having regard to (4) and (5), we deduce that (1) must

be replaced by

which—in conjunction with the boundary conditions imposed on w—would serve to
determine w if y were known.

4. In fact neither y nor w is known initially, so both must be deduced from (6)
and (10) combined with the imposed boundary conditions. These are von Karman’s
equations (§ 2).

When the boundary values of u and v are specified, introduction of y is less convenient.
Instead, by substitution for X,, Y,, X, in (4) from (3), we can derive two equations to
replace (6), as under:
