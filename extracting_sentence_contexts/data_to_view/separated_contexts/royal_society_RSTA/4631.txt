where ju; is any solution at time t of (4.6) and y= W * ju; its associated potential. Therefore, the :3
points on the support of a local minimizer jx of the energy E should correspond to critical points a
of its associated potential yy. This fact is made rigorous in the following proposition. [3

Proposition 4.1 ([64], theorem 4). Assume that W is a non-negative lower semi-continuous function : a)
