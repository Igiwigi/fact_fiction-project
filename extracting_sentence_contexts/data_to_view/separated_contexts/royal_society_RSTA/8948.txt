If [dW/dt] represent the average rate of propagation of energy across unit area of
the wave-front it is shown that

Hence expressing the rate of propagation of energy in terms of the pressure amplitude
we have

It is convenient to specify the state of affairs in the medium at any instant by the

The displacement amplitude in the medium | é¢] is given by the formule

and the velocity displacement by
|€|=2rA/a = |dp|[(ap.) =als|. . . . . . . . (10)

One of the most important results arising from the fact that waves of small
amplitude are propagated with a constant velocity independent of their intensity is
the application of the principle of superposition of vibrations. By the use of FourrER’s
Theorem it is proved that a periodic disturbance of any wave form may be analysed
into a number of simple harmonic waves whose sum gives rise to the complex
disturbance considered. It is thus sufficient in the case of sound-waves of ordinary
intensity to consider the propagation of a simple wave, as discussed in equations (3)
to (10).
