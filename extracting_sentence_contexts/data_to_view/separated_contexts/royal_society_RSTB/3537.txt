They do not cause any moditication of the ground
tissue in their region, having neither bundle sheaths, transfusion tissue, nor
secretory canals associated with them so far as can be judged from the specimens we
have. The Vascular System.—There is evidence of a double vascular system in this seed,
viz., a series of bundles in the outer flesh, and some tracheids in the inner flesh. Notwithstanding the fact that the nucellus stood free from the integument down to
the base, there is no clear evidence of tracheal tissue in its layers, It is very
