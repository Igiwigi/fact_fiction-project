After two hours, when the oxygen of the surrounding atmosphere
had been exhausted by the phosphorus, the effect became more feeble, but continued
throughout the evening. The next morning, however, the inclosed battery produced
not the slightest effect upon the iodide, the liquid had risen in the hydrogen tubes about
02 cubic inch, hut no other effect was perceptible. On the other band, in the battery
which had been placed by its side, charged in the same way, and similar in every respect
but in the fact of being exposed to the atmospheric air, a very decided effect was pro-
duced ; hydrogen had been evolved from one of the platinums to the extent of 0:3 cubic
inch in the cell containing liquid, and a decided effect was produced on the iodide. The two batteries were left in this state for three more days; the decomposition and
the evolution of hydrogen continued in the exposed battery, but none was perceptible
in the inclosed one, although the liquid had risen a little more, viz. 0'1 cubic inch in
the hydrogen tubes of the latter. After the four days above mentioned, the jar of ni-
trogen which covered the battery was taken away, and the action of the battery was
tested by iodide of potassium.
