MR. HOPKINS ON THE THEORY OF THE MOTION OF GLACIERS. 711

The maximum tension in the marginal portions of the glacier will be increased by F ;
and it is in those portions, near the lower as well as near the upper surface of the mass,
that crevasses will be most likely to be formed. The forces tending to form them may
probably be much the same in both cases; but the tendency of the incipient fissures to
open into wide creyasses must almost necessarily be much counteracted near the lower
surface by the action of the bottom of the yalley on that surface. The sides of a fissure
will not there be able to separate from each other with the same facility as at the free
surface of the mass, In fact any incipient fissure formed within the glacier and not
extending to its external s8urface, will have much less of this facility of subsequently
opening, than those which are formed nearer to the outer surface and directly commu-
nicate with it. I therefore conceive it to be yery improbable that crevasses exist in the
deeper portions of a glacier, equal in number and magnitude to those which are seen in
its more superficial portions.

35. Effects of the Orushing of the Mass.â€”It may frequently happen that the maximum
pressure ( p,) at any proposed point of a glacial mass shall be much greater than the
maximum tension p,, or the maximum tangential force T, (art. 18) at that point ; and
the dislocation may be produced by the crushing power of p,, The element may thus
be broken into a greater or smaller number of fragments, and the constraint of the mass
removed. Its onward motion will then be continued, and its continuity restored by
