Why should not similarly skilful operations be considered respectable in
arithmetic ? H. Iterative computations are not quite limiting operations in the strictest sense; for,
although the computer can always attain greater accuracy by doing more arithmetic, yet
in fact he is usually content with less than twenty significant digits; so that theorems about
infinite accuracy are not required. Here is another resemblance to lens-polishing; for if a
lens is correct to within a tenth of the wave-length of light, that is near enough.
