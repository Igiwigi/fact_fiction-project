Despite this consideration, NN-based MLPs demonstrate promising results, showing
good agreement with experimental data and estimated errors comparable with those obtained
through DFT-based AIMD simulations. For example, in the computation of Li vacancy diffusion
in amorphous Li3PO4, NN-based MLPs exhibit excellent performance, achieving results
comparable with DFT-based AIMD simulations with significantly reduced computational times:
approximately four times faster [86]. In fact, NN potentials have found excellent applicability
in studying ionic conductivity in solid-state electrolytes, as evidenced in investigations on
LigGeP 2819 [87], LipLagZr2O1 and Na3Zr7SizPO}p [88]. Moving now to MTPs, this relatively novel class of MLPs relies on an efficient polynomial
basis of interatomic distances and angles. In MLPs, the total energy of the system (E"™) is
defined as the sum of individual atomic contributions (V):


N
E™ = )V(s). (4.4)

Here, N denotes the total number of atoms, and s; represents the set of atomic numbers and
vectors rj pointing from the central atom to its neighbouring atoms within a defined distance
range.
