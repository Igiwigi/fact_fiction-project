that the use of classical concepts was indispensable for
understanding physical reality, because these concepts

action was an empirical fact. These points were some
of the building blocks in his rejection of scientific

and calculative function; he rejected a pictorial interpretation of the formalism, whereas he
supported a contextual application of the classical concepts in relation to a given experiment.

After I have presented Bohr’s philosophy, I will attempt to compare it with Chris Fuchs’
