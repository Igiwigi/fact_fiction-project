Another way is to consider it as two interpenetrating cristobalite arrangements
of OCuy tetrahedra. This latter view gives the idea that there may be RUMs involving these


tetrahedra, and if so they may be associated with the mechanism for NTE. However, our ab initio
lattice dynamics calculations [49] suggest that the RUM description of the phonon dynamics
is actually not appropriate, which is explained by the fact that the shortest Cu---Cu inter-
tetrahedral distances are the same as the Cu---Cu intra-tetrahedral distances. The structure is
simply too-closely packed to permit RUM flexibility. Actually it also turned out that there is
greater rigidity associated with the linear O-Cu-O linkage [49].
