Human perceptions and representations of
alien life will not only derive from science, but, given that humanity is more than
just a collection of logic and facts, they will be highly influenced by cultural and
yÂ»sychological factors. Therefore, reactions will not necessarily be homogeneous,
and reality may defy common myths [49]. It is believed by some that establishing

1e presence of extra-terrestrial life as a fact will cause a crisis for certain
religious faiths. A survey, however, shows that followers of all the main religious
denominations as well as atheists declare that it will not be a problem for their
own beliefs [50]. While scientists are obliged to assess benefits and risks that relate to their
research, the political responsibility for decisions arising following the detection
of extra-terrestrial life cannot and should not rest with them.
