enlarged, appearing as wide, somewhat flattened tubes, sometimes partially filled by a
deeply staining material and bounded by a flattened nucleated layer of no great thick-
ness, in which cell outlines are not apparent. So far, I have failed to observe any of
these glands opening on the surface. That is no doubt to be accounted for by the
fact that the zone is clothed all over by a very peculiar thick cellular layer, composed
of large vacuolated cells, of quite variable form and superimposed on each other, several
deep. ‘This irregular layer appears to be of epithelial origin, since it passes into con-
tinuity marginally with the low uterine epithelium which clothes the remainder of the
endometrium. ‘here are indications that during life the trophoblast of the adjacent
chorion was in intimate contact with its surface. Further study of this periplacental
zone is necessary in order to determine its precise significance. Meantime we can only
surmise that it plays a part in the provision of nutritive materials for the use of the
developing embryo. Lastly, it remains to be mentioned that the remainder of the
endometrium (corresponding to the decidua parietalis) is reduced (in Tarsius 72) to an
extremely attenuated layer composed of the single-layered uterine epithelium and an
underlying very thin layer of connective tissue, containing here and there a uterine
gland. The extreme thinness of this region of the endometrium is no doubt the result
