We see that the
epidermal structure of their petioles matches closely that of the fruit stalks, both in
its dorsiventrality and in cell form and thickening. The structure of the fruit wall in
Gristhorpia is like that of the upper epidermis in the Sagenopteris lamina, though no
lamina has been found with a structure that can be closely compared with the epidermis
of Caytonia fruits. These points of resemblance may be coincidences, but when taken
with the facts of association they justify us in saying that not only is the connection
of Sagenopteris with the Caytoniales possible but probable. Various arguments may be urged against this view and these may now be considered. (a) On the grounds of the leaf shape and venation Sagenopteris is generally regarded as
allied to Marsilia and the Hydropteridee.
