This was formerly
supposed to occur in Discoglossus, and to be a primitive feature. It is now known
not to occur in adult Discoglossus. In the Pelobatide a dorsal gap appears to be
constant and to be here a true indication of relationship, in spite of the fact that it has
also been recorded in the unrelated Rhacophorus dennysi (Frazier, 1924). A ventral
gap, however, is present in several unrelated species, namely, Oreophrynella quelchit,
Crinia signifera, Leptodactylus caliginosus (but not ocellatus), Pseudohemisus longimanus
and Cacosternum capense. A paired lateral break is present in Dendrobates tinctorius
(Biume, 1930) and perhaps in Edalorhina perezi.
