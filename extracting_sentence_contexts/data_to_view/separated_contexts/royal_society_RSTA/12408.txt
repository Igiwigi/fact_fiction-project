In addition to this pulse there is a second pulse, as in Table V., with its
crest about 11 days before the day of largest sunspot area. The chief departure from
the phenomena seen in Table V. is that this earlier pulse has become decidedly more
prominent. This fact, and the further fact that the earlier, or secondary, pulse is in
both tables especially conspicuous in the case of the highly disturbed years 1891, 1895,
and 1896, suggests that the phenomenon is largely a pure disturbance effect. At the
same time, the years of sunspot minimum 1890, 1899, and 1900, show a more
prominent crest at day nâ€”12 than do the years of sunspot maximum, which were

much more disturbed. An explanation of the secondary pulse which may suggest itself is that a reduction
of sunspot area below the mean for the year is itself a cause of disturbance.
