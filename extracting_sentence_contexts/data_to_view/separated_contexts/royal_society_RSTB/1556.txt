IL is not possible, however, to identify any special tinets of fibres con-
yerping towards the creseentie process from the anterior and lateral walls of the
wecum, but that portion of the dorsal wall which extends fiom the inner edge of the
process to au insertion into the free spicular extremity of the longitudinal ridge, may
perhups be considered tu represent the radial fibres of other Silarica,

The relations of the ventral outgrowths to the air-bladder suggest tliat they should

awbnaormal forms as Lorieamia Callichthys and Lypaphthalmus constitute the ventral
walls of tha bony capsules for the air-bladde, There is no trace of airy superticial
fibwous investment to the bladder, or of a transyerse membrane, in fact, the place of
these structures is really taken by the ventral outgrowths which here, as in other
instances, may, with some probability, be regarded as die to the ossification of
the former,

‘The Leipus is very similar ta that of Glyplosternwm, the creseentic process haying so
slight an inward curvature as to be alinost straight. The interculaviom is a very small
nodule of bone imbedded in the interossicular ligament, Except that it has no
