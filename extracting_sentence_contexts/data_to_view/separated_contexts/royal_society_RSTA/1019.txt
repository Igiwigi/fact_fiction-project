While this limits the
scope of application of Rivlin-Ericksen fluids, general power-law fluids that are a special subclass of Rivlin-Ericksen fluids
are useful in describing a reasonably large class of non-Newtonian fluids. Also, other than in the case of the Navier-Stokes
model and power-law fluid models, that are Rivlin-Ericksen fluids of order one, one will encounter serious problems with
regard to the specification of boundary conditions for the boundary-value problems for higher-order Rivlin-Ericksen fluids,
as the equations governing the flow lead to partial differential equations of order n +1 for fluids of order 1. This, in fact,
led investigators to study very special boundary-value problems where terms of order greater than two in the equation
were absent or by using formal perturbation methods to solve boundary-value problems without recognizing that they were
treating singular perturbations as though they were regular perturbations. Also, while the early attempt by Greensmith &
Rivlin to determine pressure hole errors was an important investigation, they incorrectly concluded that such errors do not
exist. Also, Rivlinâ€™s work on multiple integral representations with Green and others does not have much utility as it is well-
nigh impossible to design an experimental programme to determine uniquely the material properties of the fluids defined
using the integral representations.
