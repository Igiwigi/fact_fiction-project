There is a remarkable difference between the hills
and valleys even within the cases examined here (three out of the five presented in figure 8). For
low spacing between hills (S/5 = 0.29), the variation in thrust and power appears to be negligible. As the spacing is increased to $/5 = 0.89, the variation in thrust and power potential becomes
significant and follows (in fact, accentuates) the secondary flow arrangement found in the mean
flow. For even higher spacing (S/5 = 1.74), the variation between hill and valley is reduced, owing
to the presence of tertiary flows. For example, at a height of 0.25 above the surface (assuming a
turbine with hub height at this location), the differences in thrust and power between peak and
valley are negligible for S/5 =0.3.
