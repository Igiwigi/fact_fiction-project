Tf, as it seems plausible to do, we attribute the difference of resistance to
difference of diameter, this actual difference must amount to 5255 inch. The mean
diameter of the windings is about three inches ; and if the two wires were wound upon
a 8mooth cylinder of this diameter, the difference in the diameter of the windings
would be z7257 of the whole. As this estimate would be inereased were we to take
into account the fact that each winding really sits upon two windings of the layer
underneath, and that these cannot be practically in actual contact, we may perhaps

350 LORD RAYLEIGH ON THE CONSTANT OF MAGNETIC

consider the small anomalous differential effect upon the external magnet to he
sufficiently explained by the observed difference of resistances,

Correction for finite length. 15. If the tube were infinitely long the difference of potentials at its ends due to
the unit current in one winding would be 4T7.
