Mr. Donson finds that
the gradient direction is not attained till a height is reached which is more than twice
the height at which the gradient velocity is first attained. He remarks, in fact, that
the gradient velocity is usually attained at a height of 300 metres, though the gradient
direction is not found till a height of 800 metres has been attained. This is a most
remarkable result, but it might have been expected from the equations (12) and (13). The height at which the gradient direction is attained is given by putting v = 0 in
(12).
