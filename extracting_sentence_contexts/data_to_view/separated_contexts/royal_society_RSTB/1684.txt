The leaflets appear to have been decurrent
Om the finer branches of the rachis. We cannot venture to refer the leaf to any known
Expecies of Sphenopteris, but a certain resemblance to various forms can be traced,
Bee, for example, the figures of S. Haninghausi, S. tridactylites, S. linearis, &c., in
RONGNIART'S “ Histoire des végétaux fossiles.”)
The mere fact, that the foliage of Lyginodendron resembled that of certain Ferns is
Sn itself no proof of affinity with Filices. The classical case of Stangeria is a sufficient
arning against any such hasty inference. It must, however, be remembered that in
the foliage of Lyginodendron we have not only fern-like form and venation, but
fern-like structure, whereas in the case of Stangeria a single transverse section of
gthe petiole would be sufficient to prove that the plant is no Fern but a Cycad.
= Where a number of sections have been cut from the same specimen, it is possible to
Grace the repeated branching of the rachis and to observe the insertion of the leaflets
pon its branches.
