In the last two experiments the endiometer was heated by hot glycerin in the jacket. These additional experiments confirm the previous series ; a change of initial tem-
perature greatly influences the division of the oxygen. But they also bring to light a
very important fact. The coefficient of affinity does not materially alter when the
temperature is raiged from 60? to 120%. The coefficient found at these two tem-
peratures in the second series is als0 the same as that found at 60? in the firs series.
