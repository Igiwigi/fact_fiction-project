S= 8, What =k S21 pz; for the corresponding
sum of squared frequencies of all alleles. We express equation
(2.1) in terms of 01, S; and S:

each dataset can give rise to a numerically distinct value ST R-S+5,—-7 2%, at oR PhiPui

not due to features of the underlying human biology, but (A1)
rather, due to different constraints on the Fsr measure itself.

Fsr bounds contribute to explaining quantitative variation By construction of equation (2.1), the denominator of
in variance-partitioning computations—in which, although equation (A 1) lies in (0, K?), as 0<Hr<1 from the fact that
numerical values differ, the within-population component o2>0. The numerator lies in [0, K?), as 0<H;<Hr<1, so
of genetic variation consistently predominates. The math- that 0<H;—Hg<1. Fer lies in [0, 1], as OSH; and 0<Hr

In equation (A 1), the numerator is less than or equal to the Dries PkiPe1- Because ot — $1 is subtracted from both
