It could, how-
Z ever, be easily decided by experiment whether more heat is evolved in the C.P. or R.
-2 discharge. B Secondly, My induction machine, as I have already stated, can be used collaterally ;
5 in this case the quantity is double, and should have a fourfold heating power. In fact,
S its discharge (or rather the air which that discharge heats) fuses a piece of platinum
S wire, which the consecutive arrangement only reddens. Now, if the lines were produced
Z by mere heat, the spectrum of the former discharge should be far the brightest : it is
& not 50 in the red and green; in the violet there is a difference, but I think an unprac-
& tised observer would scarcely notice it. I however saw the lines beyond H more easily
S and further.
