Although the above measurements are calculated to the third place of decimals, we
cannot attach much importance to estimations beyond 01 p, for not only does the
variation in length and width of the chromosomes exceed this amount, but in practice
a much greater degree of accuracy than 01 p is not attainable. Nevertheless, the
figures as given represent the results of averaging, and it seemed better to leave
them as they were arrived at; in any event, they may be taken as the best approxi-
mate values we could obtain.

The one fact which does stand out clearly is that the chromosome volumes of the
two nuclear types of these Primulas are practically identical, a result which would
certainly not have been anticipated from a comparison of the respective sizes of the
nuclei,

Tt is, we think, legitimate to conclude that the doubled number of chromosomes
in the later hybrids may be attributed to a transverse fission of the “normal”
chromosomes, and not to addition of the chromosomes of a second nucleus, such as
seemed at first a not improbable explanation of the double number. The increase
of size which accompanies the increase in the number of chromosomes is not at first
sight easy to account for, but if it be conceded that the size of the nucleus, and corre-
spondingly the size of the cell, may be correlated with the superficial area of the
