compare the slow combustion of phosphorus with the putrefaction of azotic organic
matters, both of them taking place in the atmosphere. And if it be a fact that during
the slow combustion of phosphorus and ether, ozone is produced, it does not seem to
be an over-bold conjecture to suppose that ozone is also formed during the putrefac-
tion of azotic substances, and the nitrogen of those matters oxidized into nitric acid.
As phosphorus which contains no trace of nitrogen, nevertheless forms nitric acid-on
its being slowly burned in atmospheric air, it seems to be not, impossible that organic
substances containing no nitrogen produce also ozone, and along with it nitric acid
during the slow oxidation they undergo in atmospheric air. It seems to me to be im-
portant to ascertain, by accurate experiments, whether, under the circumstances last
mentioned, nitric acid or nitrates are formed. Some observations made by Bra-
coNnNoT and SAUSSURE 8eem to speak in favour of such a formation, they are however
too vague to decide the question. To arrive at certainty regarding that fact is im-
portant, not only with respect to the theory of spontaneous nitrification, but also
with reference to a matter which has of late been the subject of much discussion:


PROFESSOR SCHOENBEIN ON SPONTANEOUS NITRIFICATION. 141

From what source does the vegetable world draw the nitrogen which we meet in 80
many of her products? Tf, according to a prevailing notion, it be only nitrogen in a
compound state that can be assimilated by plants, is it not possible that nitrogen
contained in nitrates might be as well taken up by them as the azote of ammonia ?
It is easy to see that in the affirmative case some nitrogen would be offered to grow-
ing plants by the means of organic substances containing no azote, and putrefying in
