They
pioneered the use of Giaever tunnelling with ferromagnetic electrodes such as
Ni by showing that the Zeeman splitting of the BCS density of states could be
used to extract values of the polarization. As the controversy ensued over the
low values of polarization found for Ni (only a few per cent), centring on the
extent of s compared with d electron contributions to the tunnelling current, a
short paper was published by Julliere [16]. This paper is remarkable because i
elegantly, and now famously, links the tunnelling conductance to the polarization
of the electrodes and the fact that it has three times as many citations as there
are words in the paper. Interest in tunnelling magnetoresistance (TMR) soarec
after the discovery by Moodera et al. [17] and Miyazaki & Tezuka [18] of room
temperature values of the TMR of several per cent. These results indicated tha
new devices based on tunnel junctions might be possible and are directly linkec
to the TMR read head in hard discs and MRAM that are in use today.
