As the quantity of 8olution dealt with was never less than 4 grms., and was
generally about 8 grms., it is obvious that the greatest error to be expected on
account of occasional slight distillation from inequality of temperature, or on account
of the water vapour always present, is inappreciable. When the metal tube is used
the error is still less, because its greater mass and superior conducting power are
favourable to the maintenance of a constant temperature.

Attempts were made to employ a metal tube provided with valves of various kinds,

* The bath was in fact carefully tested, and the constancy of its temperature ascertained,

arranged 80 that after draining the solution from the residual crystals ib was shut off
in a portion of the tube of known capacity, further entrance or escape of yapour being
prevented, the risk of an impoverished solution continuing to drain into it during
cooling being also done away with. But though we were successful in getting 8uch a
tube constructed, the difficulty of working it and of keeping ib in working order, led
us to abandon it in favour of a simpler form.
