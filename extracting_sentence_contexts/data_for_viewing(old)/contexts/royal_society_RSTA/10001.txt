obtained on heating a wire in a vacuum, This diminution was explained as being
due to the removal of traces of hydrogen or oth√©r substances from the wire, and I
suggested that possibly a complete removal of such traces would entirely destroy the
negative leak. Since then RicHarpson (loc. cit.) has described an experiment in
which the leak from a platinum tube in air at atmospheric pressure was measured
while hydrogen was allowed to diffuse through the platinum from the inside of the
tube out into the air. He found that the small negative leak was unchanged by the
hydrogen. I have repeated this experiment and confirmed his result. As RicHarDsoN
points out, this experiment shows clearly that the very small negative leak given by
platinum in air is not due to traces of hydrogen in the platinum. In addition,
measurements of the negative leak from clean platinum wires in air and other gases,
except hydrogen, give fairly concordant results, so that I think there is now no doubt
that there is a small negative leak due to the platinum itself. In fact, since traces of
hydrogen in the surface of the platinum must be burnt up at once when it is heated
in air, it is almost impossible that such traces could be the cause of the small leak
given in air, This conclusion, of course, does not apply to the much larger leaks
which are obtained when an ordinary platinum wire is heated in a vacuum without
any special precautions. I think there is no doubt that they are due, as I suggested,
to traces of hydrogen. In the present paper, when the negative leak in hydrogen is
referred to, it is not intended to imply that there is not a small negative leak due to
the platinum itself.

To return to the comparison of the positive and negative leaks, the variation with
the pressure at constant temperature will be taken first. RrcHarpson shows that the
positive leak increases with the pressure of the oxygen at low pressures rapidly, but
