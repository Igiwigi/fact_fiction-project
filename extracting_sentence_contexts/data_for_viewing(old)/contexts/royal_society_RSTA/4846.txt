in C"+1, where cs) denotes the kth complex derivative of ¢ ats ¢ C and tau) :=¢. This
generalization of the Bohr—Courant theorem (from [114]) is due to Voronin in [116] and
was probably a key motivation for Voronin’s discovery in [117] of the universality of ¢
(in the right critical strip). The universality theorem was extended to (suitable) compact
subsets of the right critical strip by Bagchi in [118] and Reich in [119]. We refer, for
example, to the books [38,115,120] along with [8,11] for many other relevant references
and extensions of the universality theorem to other L-functions.

(b) The universality of ¢ in the right critical strip roughly means that given any compact
subset K of G < Re(s) <1} with connected complement in C, and given any nowhere
vanishing (complex-valued) continuous function g on K that is holomorphic on the
interior of K (which may be empty), then g can be uniformly approximated by some (and,
in fact, by infinitely many) vertical translates of ¢ on K.

(c) A quantized (i.e. operator-valued) version of universality is provided in [8,11].
Interestingly, in that context, the natural replacement for the complex variable s is the
family of truncated spectral operators {IM} reg.


The spectral operator a = ac is bounded (and hence invertible, with a compact spectrum o(a)
not containing the origin), for every c > 1; it is unbounded (and therefore its spectrum o(a) is a
closed unbounded subset of C) for every c < 1. It is not invertible for 3 <c<1since 0 €o0(a)=C;
by contrast, according to theorem 5.1, it is invertible (i.e. 0 ¢ o(a)) for every c € (0, 3) if and only if
the RH is true. For a discussion of the mathematical phase transition occurring (conditionally) in
the midfractal case when c = 3, we refer to [14,15] and [8,9]. In this context of §5, we also refer to
