Cl = 65°44, Br = 67°63. I = 60°40.

These figures give for the transport number of the three salts the following
numbers :—

Potassium chloride = 0°502, Potassium bromide = 0°511, and
Potassium iodide = 0°501,

which is practically the same ratio as that found by us. The difference between the
actual values is due to Kontrauscu’s figures being for infinite dilution, whereas ours
are for 2/50 solutions.

Further confirmation of the correctness of our results is afforded by the fact, which
will be referred to again later, that the potassium ion has the same velocity in
equimolecular solutions of the above three salts if our values for the transport
numbers are correct, but its velocity is different if the ordinary values are correct.

Measurement of the Ionic Velocities.

The term “ionic velocity” appears to have been used by different writers in
different senses, and as a consequence there is some confusion as to its exact
significance. In what follows we shall speak of :—

(1) The actual measured velocity of the ion or ionic margin, which is its velocity
under the potential gradient of the experiment.
