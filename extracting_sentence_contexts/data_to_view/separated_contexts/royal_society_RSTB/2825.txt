Again, the number of the sporangiophores is usually half that of the sterile leaves,
but the number is not strictly maintained, while their disposition in vertical, non-
alternating series is on a plan quite apart from that of the alternating whorls of
sterile leaves. ‘Their position on the internode also, sometimes at the base, sometimes
at the upper limit, often in the middle, again shows their independence of the sterile
leaves. These facts together point to their being independent structures. * © Annals of Botany,’ vol. 3, Plate 23, fig. 71.
