The nucleolus is a waste bye-product of chromatin
activity (HAckER, 1893 and 1895); it supplies nutriment to the chromatin (FLEMING, 1882, BAMBEKE,
1885, Korscuert, 1895, Lusoscn, 1902); it is the organ by which the unorganised chromatin of the
cytoplasm is converted into the organised chromatin of the nucleus (R. Hertwie, 1902): it discharges
into the cytoplasm material by means of which yolk formation takes place (MACALLUM, 1891, JoRDAN,
1893). The yolk nucleus is the formative centre for the yolk (MERTENS, 1895, BAMBEKE, 1898); it is a
mere condensation of, nutritive material in the cytoplasm (LuBoscu, 1892); it is derived from, or is
analogous to, the centrosome (BALBIANI, 1893, MEvEs, 1894, Foor, 1896, Munson, 1898).

+ The need for a revision of existing descriptions of the egg’s growth before attempting to bring this
process, for all eggs, under one general scheme of metabolism is forcibly indicated by the fact that some of
the features in which many other eggs appear to differ from Antedon as now described have been described
by previous workers for this very type. Among these may be mentioned the fragmentation of the yolk
nucleus and assumed active participation of the latter structure in yolk formation, so also the amesboid
movements of the germinal vesicle and the radiations from the latter into the cytoplasm,

a range of variation as possible in the appearance of the fixed material. The reagents
thus selected for the purpose of the present investigation are five in number, viz. :—
Saturated sublimate solution ; saturated sublimate with 5 per cent. acetic acid ;
potassium bichromate 3-per-cent.-solution with 5 per cent. acetic acid; HmrrMAnn’s
fluid ; and a solution containing potassium bichromate, sodium sulphite, nitric and
osmic acids, and which for convenience of description will be referred to in the paper
as “BNO.” This solution, which was recommended to me by Dr.
