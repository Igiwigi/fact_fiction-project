The leptotene elongation, on the other hand, is far more difficult to prove conclusively. The chief evidence for it has two serious disadvantages. The fact that only one chromo-
some has been measurable at leptotene has been felt so acutely that publication of this
manuscript has been deferred for six months in the unfulfilled hope of a repetition. A further difficulty is in the technique used. Acetic acid has the peculiar property of
practically doubling chromosome sizes at all stages.
