of the naked-eyed Meduxe, the action of light as a stimulus is most marked and
unfailing. In the case of Sarsia, for instance, a flash of light let fall upon a living
specimen almost invariably causes it to respond with one or more contractions. If
the animal is vigorous and swimming freely in water, the effect of a momentary flash
thrown upon it during one of the natural pauses is immediately to originate a bout
of swimming. But if the animal is non-vigorous, or if it is removed from the water and

every flagh. There can thus be no doubt that a sndden transition from darkness to
light acts upon Sar as a stimulus, and this even though the transition be but of
momentary duration. The question therefore arises as to whether the stimulus consists
in the presence of light, or in the occurrence of the sndden transition from darkness -
to light and from light to darkness. 'To answer this question I tried the converse expe-
riment of placing a vigorous specimen in sunlight, waiting till the middle of one of the
quiescent stages in the swimming-motions had come on, and then suddenly darkening.
