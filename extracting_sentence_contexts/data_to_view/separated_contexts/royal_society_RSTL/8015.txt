The correspondences of size, the similar
central area in each, and the vascular ring surrounding that area present coincidences
too striking to be overlooked. It will have been observed that IT have said nothing about that remarkable form of
Lepidodendroid plant, the Halonia. The fact is, T have not been able to obtain speci-
mens throwing any light upon this subject beyond what has already been done by
Mr. Dawes. His figure and description, given in the Proceedings of the Geological
Society of London for March 22, 1848, are 80 clear that there can be no difficulty in
locating the plant in its proper place.
