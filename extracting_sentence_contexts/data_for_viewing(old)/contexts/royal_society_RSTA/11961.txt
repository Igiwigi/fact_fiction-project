temperature range of our Baudin thermometer of one part in 25,000, and in the
Tonnelot standard it would be equal to only the sixth part of that value. For the
sake of uniformity we have continued to use GumLauME’s number, and therefore
take for the Baudin 12,772,

a = 0°002084
B = 0:002238,

where « and 8 measure in degrees the changes in the apparent temperature due to
a change of pressure of 1 centim. of mercury applied to the outside or inside
respectively.

A small correction was necessary to allow for the fact that the mercury in that
part of the stem which is not immersed in the calorimeter is not necessarily at the same
temperature as the water. To ascertain this correction two small thermometers were
used, one placed in the space between the calorimeter and the dise (D, fig. 5) which
covered the water jacket, while the other was placed above this dise about half-way
between it and the upper end of the thread. We found that in the last period when
the calorimeter had risen about 2°, that part of thread below the dise D could be
assumed to be at a temperature 1° above that of the air, while that part of the
thread which was above the disc had not appreciably changed its temperature. The
correction was always small, as the whole rise was only 2° and only a few degrees of
the stem were exposed to the air,

The thermometer was always read by means of a -cathetometer telescope, the
