activity of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) by Zhuang et al. [58]. It is a measure of the
degree of coordination on surface atoms. The work function (@) indicates the minimum energy
necessary to move an electron from the highest occupied band into the vacuum. Losiewicz et al.
investigated the catalytic activity of different metals in the hydrogen electro-evolution exchange

current using the work function as an activity descriptor, proving that the catalytic activity :2
is a periodic function of their atomic numbers [59]. Likewise, Shen et al. [60] used Â® as an : =
additional descriptor along with the d-band centre to improve the predicting accuracy and to : Ss
understand the catalytic properties in oxygen reduction reactions. They considered the fact that a)
band hybridization and electron transfer can occur at the same time when a molecule adsorbs : <
on TMs. The d-band centre (eg) parameter was introduced by Hammer & Noerskov [61,62] and : >
it measures the interaction strength between a TM and an adsorbate, which is directly related to Lo
the filling of the bonding orbitals. However, this descriptor needs to explicitly take into account :8
how the bond-strength depends on the reduction of the adsorbate antibonding state, which is : =
defined through the upper-edge position of the d-band [63]. Thus, the emptier the antibonding is, DR

the stronger the interaction becomes. In other words, a higher d-band centre results in stronger
bonds [49,64].

Vojvodic et al. [65] proposed a modification of the d-band model introducing the d-band
width (W,) in the oxygen bonding at metal surfaces, eW = &q + Wq/2. The new energy descriptor
