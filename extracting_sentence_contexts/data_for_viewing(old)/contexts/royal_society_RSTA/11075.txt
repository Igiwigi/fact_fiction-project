A power of 1500 and careful focussing showed this sparkle to be due to numerous
spots, which sometimes appeared white; this is presumably the detail of the eutectic.
In the photograph (fig. 1) the darker parts are the spaces full of eutectic, but the scale
is too small to show the smaller detail.

The next alloy contained 16°9 atoms of aluminium. It was very white when
polished by the wet method, and the microscope showed, before etching, golden crosses
dimly visible on a white ground. When lightly etched, a power of 50 diameters
brought out a beautifully regular pattern of rectangular crosses and bars on a dark
ground that was finely. mottled with gold. The ground was brown and the pattern
generally golden, but under some conditions of etching the pattern seemed to be
white, and many of the minute specks in the brown mother-substance seemed to be
white also. A power of 1000 brought out very clearly the fact that the ground was a
eutectic mixture. A slowly-cooled alloy, containing 18°1 atoms, of which we give a
photograph (fig. 2), presented a very similar pattern, but on so large a scale that it was
visible to the naked eye ; the pattern in the slowly-cooled alloy was, however, always
golden. Although we have mentioned the occasional whiteness of the pattern in the
16:9 atom alloy, we do not feel able to attach any importance to it, as it was probably
due to some electrolytic action occurring during the process of etching.

Light etching with bromine water shows very clearly that the ground of the
18'1 atom slowly-cooled alloy is a eutectic mixture, as the gold is left standing up in
bent rods and crinkles while the other substance of the eutectic is eaten away. We
