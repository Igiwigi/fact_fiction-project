The palstave might thus have been
incorporated in the root system of the tree secondarily. But reference to the map shows
that the site of the discovery is extremely marginal and, from what has previously been
stated in connexion with the oaks at site V and at Castlehill Farm, it will be realized
that even if the axe was genuinely in situ all the bog oaks of this district are not
necessarily contemporaneous with those of the lower peat. Nevertheless, the signi-
ficant fact remains that oak trees were growing at or after Middle Bronze Age times,
on sites which afterwards became wet enough to preserve the trees in growing peat. (3) A Bronze Age socketed adze was found lying on a “bog oak” at Castlehill Farm
(Garrood 1929). Further enquiry suggested that this was ploughed up in a peat field
from a depth of about 15 in.
