There is however no course open but to take all matter to
= be magnetic in the same way, the only difference being in some very special circum-
‘6 stance in the aggregation of the molecules of iron compared with other molecules. 5 The small magnetic moment of molecules of most substances may in fact be explained
7g more fully on the same lines as their small electric moment (§ 64). The vortices will

be quite permanent as regards both atomic charge and electric intensity, so that the
8g explanation of diamagnetic polarity given by WEBER, on the basis of currents induced
- in the atomic conducting circuits, cannét now stand. *
