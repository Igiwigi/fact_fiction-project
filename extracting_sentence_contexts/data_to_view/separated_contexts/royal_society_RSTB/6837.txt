Of the cone axis it merely needs to be said that it agrees with typical stems in bearing
its lateral organs on all sides: the possibility that the Beania cone might be a compound
sporophyll and its central part a rachis is thus excluded on ordinary morphological
definitions. It is thus comparable in general with any other cone axis, such as those
of Conifers or Cycads. It is a fact that no living Cycad has a lax cone like that of
Beania, while a few living and fossil conifers have comparable cones, but in view of the
fact that plants with even more divergent types of floral structure are included in the
main Gymnosperm orders (e.g. Cycas, which has no female cone in the ordinary sense),
it is clear that this difference is not of sufficient importance to separate Beania from
the Cycads, though it may well be used to distinguish as a subfamily the Nilssoniae. The form and structure of the sporophyll is remarkably like that of the genera of
the Zamioideae in all respects, and it is unlike the sporophylls of any other group than
the Cycads. A comparison was once made between the Beania sporophyll and the
seed-bearing organ of Ginkgo (Seward 1900, p. 275), but its author later gave up this
view (Seward 1917, p. 502).
