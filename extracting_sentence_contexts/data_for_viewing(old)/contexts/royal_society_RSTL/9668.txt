particular points is a question which is ab present, ab all events, an open one, but that
the linear absorptions, common to the hydrocarbons and to those bodies in which
hydrogen is in combination with other elements 8uch as oxygen and nitrogen, is
due to hydrogen there can be no manner of doubt.

We may go a step further than this, however. We find both edges of gome
bands to accord with the position of known hydrogen lines, whilst in others we find
that only one edge can be 80 marked. Though direct evidence is wanting to enable
us to say that the other edge marks the position of a hydrogen line, yet the cireum-
stantial evidence that such is the case is excessively strong. In point of fact, of the
hydrogen lines and edges of bands to be found in hydrocarbons lying between 900
and 972 of our empiric scale, more than half are to be found coincident with lines in
the non-carbon bodies. The following table shows the coincidences :â€”
