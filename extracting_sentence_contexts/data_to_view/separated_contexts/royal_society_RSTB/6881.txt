On the next abduction of the mandibles this food will be little disturbed by
the rounded backs of the teeth passing through and over it. As the mandibles come to-
gether for the second time, however, the median tooth, being the first to encounter the
detached food, will tend to sweep it inwards and backwards into the pre-oral cavity. Such
a mechanism of food collection would account for the fact that the most effective cutting
tooth is the last to come into contact with the grain. Food collection is probably further facilitated by the asymmetry of the mandibles. Among Crustacea it has been shown (Cannon & Manton 1927) that this plays a large part
in food transference, and in Calandra also it is probable that food is passed in a zigzag
manner between the teeth of right and left mandibles until it reaches the molar teeth,
