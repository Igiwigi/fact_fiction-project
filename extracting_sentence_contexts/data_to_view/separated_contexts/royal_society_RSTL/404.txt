facts, converge, as it were, to one point: that is, in the proof,
that the waters of the Atlantic flow into the Bay of Biscay,
along the north coast of Spain. It would seem that the north-westerly current, by Scilly,
did not, at least in many cases, balance the easterly current
round Cape Ortegal, and the land of Finisterre.* The loss of
His Majesty's frigate, Apollo, with most of her convoy, may
surely be attributed to the operation of this current. Captain
(afterwards Commissioner) WaALL1s, assured me, that after
having made, as he supposed, ample allowance for clearing
Finisterre, yet, in the night, he had a very narrow escape from
shipwreck.
