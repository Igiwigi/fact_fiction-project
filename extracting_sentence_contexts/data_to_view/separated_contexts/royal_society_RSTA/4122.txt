amusingly, the structural stability of chaotic systems takes care of this by making the needed : 3S
orbitâ€™s classical information stable and predictable even though the orbit itself is not. The number 1g

of orbits in the summation, their actions, Maslov indices, stabilities are all stable. With respect to the reversibility properties of quantum and classical dynamics of simple
chaotic systems, the inherent, strong, classical structural stability enables the reversibility

properties to be far different in many regimes despite the fact that classical information predicts : 8
the quantum dynamics all throughout these regimes. Conversely, one could deduce that, given Dos
that semiclassical theories work and the reversibility properties are extremely different, chaotic :=
systems must be structurally stable. All other quantities being fixed, in the limit f â€” 0, there : Sy
always comes a point beyond which the quantum and classical reversibility properties match. a
This can also be thought of as the large perturbation regime.
