no agglutination of the platelets. The question must, therefore, be left open,
as to whether the anaphylatoxins produce their action on the platelets in vivo wholly
by direct action, or whether the effect on these structures is to any extent secondary
to an action on the endothelium. In any case it would appear that the action
of the anaphylatoxins, when they are injected into the circulation, corresponds to
that which would be produced by the exposure of the whole blood to a large extent
of foreign surface. Numerous observers have drawn attention to the fact that
in the process of clotting, and particularly in the early stages of the process
preceding the actual formation of a clot, blood acquires a toxic action of the type
with which we are here concerned. Mrints, Raap and Jackson (33), for example,
in a recent paper, demonstrate a constriction of the bronchioles, contraction of the
uterus, and fall of arterial blood-pressure, occurring in the dog when any substance
is injected which causes intravascular coagulation, and fully developed before actual
coagulation begins. When the substance injected is ready-formed thrombokinase
(cytozyme) in adequate dose, the picture is soon obscured by clotting in the vessels,
as in the action of sera rendered toxie by digestion with chloroform. In the effect
of the anaphylatoxins, the process, in our view, would have a more gradual
development, the kinase being slowly liberated as the platelets are disintegrated ;
and in that case the clotting is prevented by the formation of antagonistic sub-
