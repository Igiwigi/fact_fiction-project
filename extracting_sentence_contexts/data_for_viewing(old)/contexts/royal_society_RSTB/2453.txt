Tt thus appears that, notwithstanding the great variations in spores per sporangium,
the resulting output per sorus is approximately uniform for the cases quoted. Doubt-
less exceptions may occur ; all I desire to do is to show that the increased length of
receptacle, and higher number of sporangia, tends to counterbalance the smaller
output per sporangium, which is seen in its extreme form in some species of
Trichomanes.

The facts before us, of external form, of anatomy, and of the gametophyte, may
bear either of two interpretations from the comparative point of view : the Hymeno-
phyllacese may be regarded as a relatively primitive series leading on to more complex
derivative forms, or they may be a series of reduction, derived from a more complex
ancestry. The new facts relating to the sorus are important in this connection ; such
large sporangia as those of H. dilatatwm compare with those of Gleichenia ; their

annulus and orientation are similar, though the dehiscence is lateral, and though they
arise in basipetal sequence instead of simultaneously. The output of spores per
sporangium in 7. Tunbridgense compares favourably with that in Ferns which have
a simultaneous sorus, and even the single sporangium of H. dilatatwin produces as
many as those of most of the Schizswacese. These facts are of the more importance
