Chem.,’ vol. 22, p. 945 (1930). ON THE PHENOMENON OF KNOCK IN PETROL ENGINES 451

If now, as was done for the slopes of the oxygen curves, the ratio :—

Average flame rate for Petrol Alone
Average flame rate for Shell + ethyl fluid

be calculated, the following values are obtained :—
Value of ratio

Throttle 6° CR per EM Na hey, corel (oP os = 505.149 0-99
33.0 LOL? ee a ear 1-11

The value of this latter ratio does not increase at a rate comparable with that of
the former as the throttle opening is increased, whence it may be inferred that
detonation is associated with a considerably accelerated flame velocity but only in
the last portion of the gases to burn. This fact has several times been conclusively
demonstrated by direct experiment. *

(e)—Stroboscopic Observation of Flame

It is important to know at what stage in the chemical processes revealed by the
analysis of the cylinder gases flame appears. In order to obtain evidence on this
point, a stroboscope was made through which to observe the passage of the flame
across a quartz window fixed in the cylinder head. The stroboscope took the form of a light hollow cylinder which was rotated by
the engine through a suitable chain of gears.
