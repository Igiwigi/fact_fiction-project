Neuville concludes that the ‘hymen’ of Paterson & Dun’s account was wrongly so called,
and that in any case it is not a normal or usual structure. Of the three female African
elephants, the reproductive tracts of which have previously been described, one, that of
Perrault (1734), appears to differ from the normal form. This is an early account, and it
may be doubted whether the specimen was in fact other than normal. In the text,
Perrault describes the uterus as being divided longitudinally into right and left halves,
with separate openings into the vagina (which he called the ‘corps de la matrice’). But
he figured this region as having a curious transverse septum, convex towards the vagina,
and pierced not by two but by four orifices, of irregular outline.
