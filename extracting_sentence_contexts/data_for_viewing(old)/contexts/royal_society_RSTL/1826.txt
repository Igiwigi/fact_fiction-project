ZANI, however, admitted that the contents of the stomach are
very generally acid ; and this accords not only with my own
observation, but with that, I believe, of almost every indivi-
dual who has made any experiments on the subject.

With respect to the nature of this acid, very various
opinions have been entertained. Some of the older chemists
seem to have considered it as an acid, $7 generis ; by others
it was supposed to be the phosphoric, the acetic, the lactic
acid,* &c. No less various have been the opinions respecting

to find how nearly ScoroLt had come to-the same conclusion. He did not indeed
come to the conclusion, as far as I can ascertain, that free muriatic acid exists in
the stomach, but he adyanced the opinion, that the muriatic acid, in union with
ammonia, Å¿ound'in such abundance in the stomach of ruminating animals, is se-

creted by that organ itself. The only account of ScoroL1's experiments I have
scen is in JonNsoxN's Animal Chemistry, i, 183.
