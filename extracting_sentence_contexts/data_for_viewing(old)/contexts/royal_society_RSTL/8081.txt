requires, m fact, a modification, by reason that, certain linear relations, which I had
asxumed to be independent, are really not independent, but, on the contrary, linearly
connected together: the interconnexion in question does not occur in regard to the
quadric, cubic, or quartic; and for these cases respectively the theory is true as it stands ;
for the quintic the interconnexion first preents itself in regard to the degree 8 in the
coefficients and order 14 in the yariables, viz. the theory gives correctly the number of
coyariants of any degree not exceeding 7, and also those of the degree 8 and order less
than 14; but for the order 14 the theory as it stands gives a non-existent irreducible
covariant (@, . .Y(@, y)'%, viz. we have, according to the theory, 5=(10—6)+1, that is,
of the form in question there are 10 composite covariants connected by 6 syzygies, and
therefore equivalent to 10 —6, =4 asyzygetic covariants; but the number of asyzygetic
coyariants being =5, there is left, according to the theory, 1 irreducible covariant of the
form in question. The fact is that the 6 s8yzygies being interconnected and equivalent
to 5 independent syzygies only, the composite covariants are equivalent to 10—5, =5,
the full number of the asyzygetic coyariants. And similarly the theory as it stands
gives a non-existent irreducible coyariant (a. .Y(a, y)”. The theory being thus in error,
by reason that it omits to take account of the interconnexion of the syzygies, there is no
difficulty in conceiving that the effect is the introduction of an infinite series of non-
existent irreducible coyariants, which, when the error is corrected, will disappear, and
there will be left only a finite series of irreducible covariants.

Although I am not able to make this correction in a general manner 80 as to show
from the theory that the number of the irreducible covariants is finite, and so to present
the theory in a complete form, it nevertheless appears that the theory can be made to
accord with the facts; and I reproduce the theory, as well to show that this is s0 as to
