ng! this reason, and because I wished to apply higher powers than
could be used with the micrometer, I adopted the following
method, which I found far more convenient, and is, I believe,
quite as accurate.

I drew on a $heet of paper several figures of two equal
circles cutting each other, placing the centres of the circles
in the first figure 7; of their radius from each other; in the
second figure 2; in the third A; and s0 on. The upper
crescent of these figures I painted blue, the lower crescent
red, and the part common to: both circles of a reddish yellow,
softening the colours into each other as they appeared in the
planet. For I considered that, in fact, it was not a single
image of Mars that was seen, but a number of differently
coloured images, lying in the same direction, though lifted
one above another, as represented in the annexed figures.
