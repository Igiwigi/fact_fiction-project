We note that these arguments rely on cloud fraction at a given level being a useful proxy
for condensation rate and precipitation efficiency; although these quantities are not necessarily
exactly equivalent, a relationship between them is clearly plausible in that a model with a
larger cloud fraction for a given in-cloud condensation rate will have a larger grid-box mean
condensation rate, and hence a stronger condensate source term to support precipitation. We
also note that inter-model differences in mid-level cloud fraction and precipitation efficiency may
ultimately be due to a range of model formulation differences, including model representations
of turbulent mixing and entrainment, which can have effects in the free troposphere as well : =

as the boundary layer, as demonstrated by Tsushima et al. [91]. The depth of the shallow Sy
circulation discussed by Sherwood et al. [21] could also influence the amount of mid-level cloud 2
and the bulk precipitation efficiency; for example, a model with a shallow circulation with a aed
maximum divergence below 700 hPa might form less mid-level cloud than a model with a shallow 22
circulation and a peak divergence at 500 hPa. [4

If the overall strength of lower-tropospheric mixing is, in fact, regulated by bulk precipitation : ie
efficiency arguments such as those outlined above, then this raises the intriguing possibility that : =
the lower-tropospheric mixing and the cloud feedback in a given model might be quite similar :3

in magnitude in the standard and ConvOff configurations, even if much of the mixing is done
by the convective parametrization in the standard configuration. A large-scale constraint on
lower-tropospheric mixing could mean that resolved and parametrized turbulent mixing adjust
to compensate for an absence of parametrized convective mixing in the ConvOff experiments. This question could be investigated in future work by directly quantifying the lower-tropospheric
mixing associated with parametrized convection, turbulent and resolved mixing, for example by
using temperature and humidity budget terms as in Zhang et al. [10] and Webb & Lock [7].
