Such behaviours do not increase
the tendency to act altruistically toward others, but rather influ-
ence the sense of belonging to a group and feelings of closeness
to social partners in order to maintain social group cohesion. It
seems most likely that this capacity evolved early in the homi-
nin lineage at a time associated with the appearance of the
genus Homo, when an increase in group size was required to
enable a dramatic expansion of the species’ biogeographic
range into more predator-risky habitats. An early (pre-
language) date for laughter would be concordant with the
facts that Duchenne laughter does not require language (even
though it can be stimulated linguistically using jokes), that
laughter is highly contagious and that it uses a very different
muscular control to that used in speech. This suggests that it
may have evolved from ape laughter (an individual signal)
as a form of intimate group chorusing (to which everyone
contributes). Reverse engineering models of the kind deployed here
have played a seminal role in evolutionary studies, where
they have allowed pinch points and constraints to be identified.
