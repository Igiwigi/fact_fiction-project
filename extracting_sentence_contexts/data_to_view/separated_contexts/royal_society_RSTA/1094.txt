The broad fluctuations are, as already explained, due to the loss of charge, either
positive or negative, by rainfall and the regeneration of charge in the cloud owing to
increased activity. It is interesting to note that, in spite of the rapid removal of charge
by heavy rainfall, the field frequently became positive when the central part of the
cloud was passing overhead and positively charged rain was falling, as it ought to be,
according to the “* breaking-drop ” theory. Hye observations indicate that a near lightning discharge gives a sudden kick to the
needle of the electrometer, and so confirms the fact that very quick and violent super-
posed oscillations are due to lightning discharges. The quick-run records, which will
be discussed later on, definitely show that these violent movements are due to near
lightning discharges. Some small but sudden movements can also be seen in other
parts of the record, and particularly in the portion LM.
