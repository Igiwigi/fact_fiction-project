In this note, we shall depart from Lipschitz free boundaries and derive
heuristically the C! regularity of the free boundary. nee)

We start by defining the notion of viscosity (or comparison) solutions!” for the free boundary
problem that we have in mind. As cavitation problems leads to jump in the gradient across the [4
free boundary, one has to start with a reasonable definition of the gradient on the boundary. This DNS
is done in the viscosity sense. [GB

Let us first remark two interesting facts about positive harmonic functions: :8

Let u>0 in D, and harmonic there, along with vanishing boundary values, locally near a boundary .
point 0D N B,(z).

(1) If D satisfies the interior ball conditions at z, i.e. By,(y) € D, and z € OBy,(y) 1 aD, then u has
asymptotically positive (possibly infinity) slope at z.

(2) If D satisfies the exterior ball conditions at z, i.e. By,(y) € D°, and z € 0B,,(y) N AD*, then u has
bounded Lipschitz norm (possibly zero) at z.
