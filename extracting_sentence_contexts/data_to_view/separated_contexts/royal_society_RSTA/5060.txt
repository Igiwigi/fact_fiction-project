The
flame spectrum of manganese is almost entirely a banded spectrum, the peculiarities
of which had not been investigated at that time. Stttm1an had urged against this view of Wepprne :—Ist. If the disappearance of
the manganese lines in the Bessemer spectrum be owing to the diminution of the
quantity of manganese, we should infer that these lines would gradually grow more
indistinct, and then fade away ; but the fact is the contrary—the manganese spectrum
increases in brillianey from its first appearance, and is more intense just before being
swept away than at any other time. The analysis of the fume which appears when
the flame ceases, proves that a considerable quantity of manganese is still volatilized ;
and it is notable that in manganiferous iron this quantity increases towards the close
of the “blow.” 2nd.
