LOW TEMPERATURES ON TENSILE PROPERTIES OF METALS. 327

Class 7. Iron, Manganese, and Silicon.—The alloy tested in this class behaves in
much the same way as 1252B steel (iron, nickel, copper). This steel is, in fact, the
most adversely affected by liquid hydrogen of any tested in the research. Class 8. Iron, Manganese, and Copper.—The feature of the behaviour in liquid air
of steel No. 1240/1 containing 2-01° manganese and 1-45% copper, was the main-
tenance of its full normal ductility of 17%.
