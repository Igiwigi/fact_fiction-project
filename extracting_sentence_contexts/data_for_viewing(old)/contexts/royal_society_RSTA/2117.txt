entropy based on the Hatsopoulos—Keenan statement is essentially equivalent to the definition
of entropy more recently proposed by Lieb & Yngvason [18] and is closely related to the various
extensions and improvements proposed thereafter [19,20].

Another important implication of the second law is the ‘state principle’, which asserts
([3, ch. 8]) that the equilibrium states of a system form an (r +s + 1)-parameter family, where
r denotes the number of conserved properties in addition to energy and s the number of
control parameters of the Hamiltonian. This assertion, in turn, implies the existence for every
system of a concave ‘fundamental equilibrium relation’, for example S = Seq(E, V,n1,...,Ny), for
a system with volume V as the only parameter and r different types of independently conserved
constituents (amounts denoted by nj). The ‘greatness’ of this second-law consequence stems from
the fact that existence and concavity must hold for any system, but the functional dependence
of the relation varies from system to system and is in fact what characterizes its equilibrium
properties.

By analogy, and to allow full flexibility of formulation, what we propose to call the ‘fourth law
of thermodynamics’ is any assertion that—regardless of the specific and technical details that are
peculiar to one or the other non-equilibrium theory, or of the prose preferences of the different
authors—entails a principle of existence of a metric field, defined over the entire state space of
the modelled system, with respect to which the irreversible (dissipative) component of the time
evolution of the system (or of each of its subsystems) is (locally) steepest entropy ascent (SEA).
The functional dependence of the SEA metric on the state variables varies from system to system
and is in fact what characterizes its non-equilibrium behaviour.

In §§2 and 3, we prepare the stage for the detailed formulation of the fourth law in §4 and one
