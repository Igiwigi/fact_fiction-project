It appears from these sections that the duct (Plate 23, fig. 29, 59.) is developed as a
hollow ridge-like outgrowth of the somatic layer of Bt: Fs directed towards the
epiblast, in which it causes a slight bulging. The cavity of the ridge freely communi>
cates with the body-cavity. The anterior part of this ridge appears to be formed first,
Very s00n, in fact, in an older embryo belonging to this stage, the greater part of the
groove becomes segmented off as a duct lying between the epiblast and somatic meso-
Ãžblast (Plate 23, fig. 28, 89.), while the front end still remains, as we believe, in com-
munication with the body cavity by an anterior pore. '
