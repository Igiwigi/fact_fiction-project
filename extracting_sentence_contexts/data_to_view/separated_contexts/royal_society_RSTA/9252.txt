Actually cannot be reduced to zero, at any rate by merely wringing the faces
together until they seize. Metallic contact, it is true, takes place, but only at those
few points where the surfaces appear torn when the solids are again separated. Else-
where the lubricant persists, and the fact that seized faces are forced apart by lubricants
with a sensible vapour pressure shows that Â¢ (z) falls off very rapidly with distance. The alternative explanation is not so easily stated. Consider first the case of a liquid
and let a now be the distance at which the attraction of the solid ceases sensibly to orient
the molecules of the liquid so that at any distance greater than a from a plane solid face
the arrangement of the molecules is random.
