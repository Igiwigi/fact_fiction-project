seismic fragility curves, based on numerical models updated with the dynamic test data, are thus
estimated. The concept of robust reliability [13,14] is here introduced considering a set of possible
structural models to represent the structure rather than a single model, thus including different
sources of uncertainties.

The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 summarizes the main concepts of the methodology
proposed to evaluate the robust fragility curve, highlighting the research novelties. Section
3 focuses on the non-isolated masonry tower typology and discusses the relevant sources
of uncertainty, which constitute the subject of the Bayesian updating. Section 4 reports the
whole procedure employed to obtain robust seismic fragility curves. Eventually, the proposed
methodology is compared with an optimization-based deterministic approach to show its
effectiveness. Its major benefit is the rigorous treatment of the uncertainties involved in the
problem. In fact, while the classical deterministic approach does not allow us to obtain a measure
of the uncertainty contained in the model updating procedure, by introducing the Bayesian
paradigm, it is possible to obtain a probability distribution of the results and then the possible
evaluation of confidence intervals on what has been obtained from the analysis.

2. Methodology

The proposed Bayesian-updated robust fragility curve is derived by calculating the probability of
failure of the structure for each considered seismic demand, with the latter expressed in terms of
Peak Ground Acceleration (PGA). Other demand measures have been proposed apart from the
PGA in literature to characterize the intensity of the seismic hazard, and the interested reader is
referred to the study by Casolo [15], where a rational discussion of these measures is presented
analysing their correlation with damage indicators; nevertheless, PGA has been chosen in the
