Given the solid potential of organic-based materials for sustainable thermoelectric applications,
it would be desirable to understand what is currently limiting their performance and devise
strategies to move forwards.

2. Limiting factors in the performance of organic thermoelectrics

In a very enlightening piece of work, Chabynic, Segalman ef al. discovered that the Seebeck
coefficient for a large number of organic thermoelectric materials was proportional to o~1/4, and
thus the power factor (S2o) increased with o!/? [12 (figure 3a). The fact that this empirical rule
was satisfied by many systems with very different chemical structures prompted strong research
activities in two directions. On the one hand, the most standard theories did not predict this
behaviour, so more advanced fundamental theories of electronic transport were advanced [13-
15]. On the other hand, it suggested that further improvement in power factor could come as a
result of further increases in the electrical conductivity: no maximum has been yet detected in the
Sâ€™o versus conductivity for organic-based compounds.
