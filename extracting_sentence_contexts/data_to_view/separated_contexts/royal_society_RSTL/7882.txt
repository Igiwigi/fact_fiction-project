The cases of
the © Minotaur,” © Bellerophon,” and © Audacious” prove the possibility of the latter con-
dition, and no more need be said respecting it. That sagging alone cannot take place


WEIGHT AND SUPPORT IN SHIPS. 435

follows from the fact, that in a ship which sags there must be an excess of weight amid-
ships as well as at the extremities, and there must consequently be some intermediate
portions at which there is an excess of buoyancy, and at which hogging-strains will
result from the moment of the unsupported weights at the bow and stern, The curve
of moments (M M in fig. 7) for the © Victoria and Albert” illustrates these remarks; in
the fore-and-after bodies we find considerable hogging-moments, while amidships, as I
© have shown, there are sagging-strains.
