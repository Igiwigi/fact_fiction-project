uterine mucosa takes place in the human female, some stating that this is
considerable, while according to others even the surface epithelium is retained intact.
According to Lipgs (1904) the denudation is variable, depending upon the rapidity
and degree of the hemorrhage. In Monkeys (Semnopithecus entellus and Macacus
rhesus) the whole of the surface epithelium and the superficial stroma are destroyed.
Surron (1880), however, states that no denudation takes place in Macacus rhesus.
Rerrerer (1892), who has written a short account of the processes occurring during
heat in the Bitch, says that the epithelium is nowhere removed except at the places
where the blood escapes into the cavity of the uterus. In the Sheep denudation
of the epithelium is probably very rare, while its normal occurrence in the Ferret
must be regarded as doubtful (Marsuatr, 1903, 1904). In the Bitch our observa-
tions tend to show that it occurs to a greater or less extent in every case. Evidence
of this may be found in the fact that epithelial cells are observed lying free in the

cavity of the uterus, while in some sections parts may be seen where the cells of
the stroma are uncovered by a lining of epithelium. A single layer of flattened

cells, similar to those which compose the bulk of the stroma, may, as a rule, be seen
in close attachment to the epithelium during the process of denudation. A similar
layer of flattened cells resembling the endothelium of the capillaries may be seen
immediately subjacent to the epithelium lining the cavity of the quiescent uterus.
