tures but solutions of one metal in the other, may be deduced from the fact of their
fusing-points being generally lower than the mean of that of the volumes taken. Secondly. To what is the rapid decrement of the conducting power due ?

The only answer which I can at present give to this question, is that most of the
other physical properties of the metal are altered in a like manner; for on looking at
the alloys made with the metals of Class A. with one another, we see that most of their
other physical properties are not at all altered ; for amongst them, for instance, we find
no brittle ones; they appear, in fact, to take an equal share of the properties of the
metals composing them.
