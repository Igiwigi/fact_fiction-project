Korré lays stress on the influence of external factors on the development of the
secondary characters, but does not appear to have attempted to control these in his
experiments. The presence of the nuptial hue in both sexes renders the question of

the cause of development of this in Phoxinus a less concise problem than that of the
secondary sexual characters of the male Gasterosteus. Lastly, although as Koprc
points out, it affected the controls as much as the experimental fish, the fact that the
fish only survived the operation by three weeks cannot be considered altogether
satisfactory. While, therefore, Kornd’s investigations show that the nuptial hue in fish is
dependent on the presence of the gonads, neither has that part of the gonad which
brings this about, nor the mechanism of this relation, been determined by him. Korré’s own observations recorded in his summary given above (2), support the
experiments recorded (p. 247) on the dependence of the development of the secondary
sexual characters in Teleost fish on the environment.
