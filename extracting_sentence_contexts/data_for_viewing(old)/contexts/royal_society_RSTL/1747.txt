For, a rod, about 59 inches long, and whose diameter is about 4 tenths of an
inch, drags with it nearly 5 grains of air: whilst another rod of nearly the
same length, and little more than one sixth of the diameter drags with it
scarcely half a grain. But, although the thicker rod drags more air than the
smaller one, yet the effect on the latter is much more considerable than on the
former. For the 4904 grains of air added to the weight of the copper rod,
would reduce the specific gravity of the vibrating mass from 8:629 to 2:939
only : whilst the 0479 grain of air added to the weight of the steel rod, would
reduce the specific gravity of the vibrating mass from 7687 to 1:024. And
these are the respective specific gravities which if used in the computations for
the reduction to a vacuum, would cause n to yanish *,

Having thus ascertained the fact that the influence of the air is greater
upon small rods than upon large ones (increasing considerably as the diameter
of the rod diminishes), I next tried what effect would be produced by affixing
various bodies to the ends of these rods. For this purpose I made use of the
two brass spheres No. 3 and No. 6, already described in the preceding part

same kind of wire, and having precisely the same specific gravity, but about half an inch longer. The
rezults differ from each other more than T could have imagined; although each set is consistent in

itself : for we have June 14. Aug. 2.
