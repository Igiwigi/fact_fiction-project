curves, and it seems probable that the pollen of Alnus and Tilia at least has been blown
from a long distance into a country sparsely populated with trees. This suggestion is
strongly supported by the fact that the curve for the ratio of non-tree pollen to tree

pollen has high values in zone IV, and falls sharply at the transition to zone V. Within
zone IV there is also a continuous Salix pollen curve, a feature consistent with open
conditions.
