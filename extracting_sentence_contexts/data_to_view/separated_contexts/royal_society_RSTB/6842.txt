Anteriorly the pregenae are prolonged into horns, and henceforward in this
account the term pregena will refer to these horns. They lie parallel with the labium but
do not extend quite so far anteriorly as its tip. The hypostoma has therefore a marked
tripartite appearance, emphasized by the fact that the anterolateral margins of the hypo-
stomal area, external to the pregenae, commence at the bases of the pregenae and sweep
anteriorly and dorsally to form the lateral margins of the rostral tip, which in turn are
continuous with the emarginated anterior edge of the epistoma. A deep posteriorly directed
cleft, occupied by the lateral plate of the mandible (figure 1, md./.), therefore occurs lateral
to each pregena. As seen in lateral view the ventral surface of the labium and of the pregenae are inclined
to some extent antero-dorsally, so that the tip of the rostrum presents a slightly obliquely
truncated appearance (figure 7).
