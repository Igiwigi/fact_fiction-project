G. NEAL ON LATERAL INSTABILITY OF

The results of the calculations are presented in figure 41, in which the relations between

L/2d and M,,/M, are plotted for values of 1 from 1-0 to 1-4. A comparison of the curves in figure 41 with those of figure 38 shows that the effect of
yield is much less marked than in the case of pure bending, owing to the fact that with
a central concentrated load yield is confined to a comparatively short central section. In
contrast to the case of pure bending, the curves terminate at a finite minimum value of
