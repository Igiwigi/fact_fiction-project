connexion is formed by the contact of the basal process of the pterygo-quadrate
with the basitrabecular process of the neurocranium, in such a manner as to be
antero-dorsal to the palatine nerve, antero-ventral to the orbital artery, and ventral
to the vena capitis lateralis and orbital sinus. In Callorhynchus, therefore, the fusion
of the pterygo-quadrate with the brain-case immediately in front of the foramen
through which the palatine nerve passes answers exactly to the definition of a basal
connexion, fig. 9, and the fact that the orbital artery runs up through the same
foramen as that which allows the palatine nerve to run down is exactly paralleled
in Lepidosteus and Salmo (pr BrER, 1926, a). As to the relative participation of basal
process (of the pterygo-quadrate) and basitrabecular process (of the neurocranium)
little can be said, Judging from the condition in Selachii, where the basitrabecular

process is only feebly developed and represented by a part of the subocular shelf, it is
probable that the major part of the basal connexion in Callorhynchus is formed by the
basal process.
