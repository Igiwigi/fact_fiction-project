spotted rats (‘Taylor 1949) and guinea-pigs, however, the melanocytes of the basal layer
are not identifiable with certainty even as clear cells; the occurrence of non-pigmentary
melanocytes in these regions can therefore only be inferred from the occurrence of their
presumed ghosts in more superficial layers of the epidermis.

Melanocytes in hair bulbs

The melanocytes of the hair bulbs and of the superficial epidermis are two normally
independent but experimentally interchangeable systems (above, p. 154). If the melano-
cyte of the superficial epidermis is a squamous cell, that of the hair bulb should also be
squamous. An experiment has already been mentioned in which a superficial epidermis
has been caused to regenerate wholly by upward migration of the epidermal epithelium
from the hair bulbs. (In clinical practice, the donor areas of Thiersch grafts do in fact
heal in this way.) The melanocytes of the newly formed superficial epidermis can only
have come from those originally resident in the hair bulbs, and treatment of the epidermis
by the brilliant cresyl blue and by Cohnheim’s method revealed a normal complement of
branched cells at superficial levels (see also Pepper 1953). If our interpretation of the
origin of these high-level branched cells is correct, this can only imply that the melano-
cytes of hair bulbs, like those of the superficial epidermis, are squamous cells. Presumably
the effete melanocytes are incorporated into the substance of the hair shaft, for it would
appear to be anatomically impossible for them to go elsewhere. The melanocytes of feather
follicles, it may be added, are agreed to be ‘expendable’ cells (Rawles 1948; Willier
1948). .
