NEUMAYER ON THE LUNAR-DIURNAL VARIATION

we must remember that during both periods the same instruments were used ; but, 8
we perceive that towards the end of the latter period the abnormities above Pointed |
make themselves clearly manifest. even in the yearly curve with the moon's declinati
north and south (see Plate XIX.). This seems to speak strongly in favour of a p
gressive change rather than of an accidental irregularity. It would be premature
enter upon an_ explanation of these facts at present, as it is evident that for 8uch
purpose we are in need of similar discussions from other localities ; suffice it to cal
attention to 80 important a class of phenomena. The subjoined Table shows the res
of this last-mentioned inquiry, and on Plate XIX. are found the lunar-diurnal variatio
curves for the periods above delineated. TaBLE II. —Lunar-diurnal Variation of the Magnetic Declination for the periods M
1858 to April 1859, and May 1860 to April 1861.
