Among them are water waves on a cylinder [10], orbital angular
momentum beam incident on a disc [11-14], or binary BHs [15]. Following a long history of theoretical studies, the rotational superradiance effect was recently
observed in the Nottingham experiment [1]. This experiment, motivated by the stunning fact
that, under specific conditions, waves propagating on a flowing fluid experience the presence of an
effective curved space-time [16,17], was based on multiple theoretical studies of superradiance in
analogue systems [18-24]. However, even with this whole array of studies, a complete theoretical
description of the superradiance experiment is still missing. This is due to the various effects
present in this experiment, the main ones being dispersion and vorticity, which even make the
determination of effective governing equations a difficult task.
