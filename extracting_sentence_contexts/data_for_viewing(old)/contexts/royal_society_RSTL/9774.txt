PHYSIOLOGY OF PEPSIN-FORMING GLANDS. 697

When the sccretion produced by a gland contains nndissolved particles, these particles may be stored up
by the gland, thus fat globules are apparently stored up by the cells of the Harderian and Mammary glands.

I do not overlook the fact that a glycerine extract of the fresh Mammalian gastrie mucons membrane
contains a good deal of pepsin, but I believe this to be due simply to the zymogen being more easily split
up in these glands than in others. Tt will be remembered that the granules of the © chief ” cells which
probably consist in part or wholly of zymogen are not preseryed by osmic acid; 7.e., these zymogen
granules split up with osmic acid, whilst the other zymogen granules we know of do not. Further, as
| mentioned above, EpsTEix and GRiTzNeR have shown that the gastric glands of Mammals do contain

8ome zZymogen.

The general course of reasoning given above, led me to make some direct experi-
| ments on the subject. The result completely confirmed the justice of the deductions
& drawn from microscopical examination. Since I propose to discuss in a later paper
a the whole question of the formation of pre-products by gland-cells, I will here only
