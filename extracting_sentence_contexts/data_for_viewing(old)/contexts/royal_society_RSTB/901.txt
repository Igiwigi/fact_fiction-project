3 Cuttie’s Hillock Quarry, but on this point there is a little uncertainty. A cast taken
E from the Elgin Museum example shows six consecutive vertebra, four of which are
E Sacral, and two presacral, while the Survey specimen, which may he part of the
~ same skeleton, contains the impressions of two late dorsal, or lumbar, vertebree. The
last-named vertebra show the left side, as well as the anterior and posterior faces ;
_ but the neural spines are only represented by the impression of an anterior and of a
| posterior extremity (figs. 1-3).

These vertebree are a little distorted : each centrum is about 28 millims. long and
t ‘18 millims. wide at its expanded extremities, but in the middle it is pinched in, being
only about 8 millims. wide at this part.. That these centra were formed by a mere
' film of bone surrounding the persistent notochord was amply testified by the fact that
' one of them, when it came to me, had the notochordal space completely filled with the
_ sandy matrix, and the space left by the dissolving away of the bone was not thicker
