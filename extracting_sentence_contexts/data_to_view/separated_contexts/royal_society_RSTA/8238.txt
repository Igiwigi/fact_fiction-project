In this transformation, quadrics of ® touch the surface of intersection 1 of any two of
them along a line | of this surface and pass through three other fixed points P, Q, R. The associated net of curves of A’ consists of conics through three base points P’,
Q’, R’ of w, each of these curves being augmented by the conic through Aj, ..., A;,
repeated. ‘I'he ®-curves are rational sextics passing through P, Q, R and touching
I at four points of l. There are four systems of E-curves in § namely :—

(a1), (da), (ds) Cubics which pass through two of the points P, Q, R and which touch I
twice at points of |; these curves fill up the primes [PQ, 1], [QR, 1], [RP, U] and
give rise to these triple base planes of VY’, 01, oe, a3.

(b) Lines which touch I at points of 1; these lie in the «1 tangent planes to I at
points of /, and all such tangent planes form a quadric line-cone K, whose vertex
is | (as appears from the fact that any prime through / contains two of them)
and they are represented in & by the generators of a rational ruled quintic base
surface F,® of ¥. Neighbourhood of the line l.—If we prescribe the tangent prime for a quadric of ® at
a given point P (0) of J, then the tangent prime is thereby determined at every point
ofl. For the given tangent prime must contain, besides the tangent plane to I at P (0),
say w@ (0), another plane of K,, say w (0), and this will be tangent to I at some point
P (89) of L; also, since this other plane is tangent to the quadric at two points of 1, it
must be tangent to it at every point of /, and the tangent prime at any point of | is
determined, then, by this plane and the tangent plane to | at the point.
