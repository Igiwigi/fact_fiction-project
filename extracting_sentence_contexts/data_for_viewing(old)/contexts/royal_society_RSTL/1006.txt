potash and sulphuric acid made to combine in an insulated
platina crucible produce no electrical appearances... A solid
amalgam of bismuth and a solid amalgam of lead become
fluid when mixed together: the experiment, I find, is con-
nected with a diminution of temperature, but with no exhi-
bition of electrical effects. A thin plate of zinc, after being
placed upon a surface of mercury, and separated by an insu-
lating body, is found positive, the mercury is negative : the
effects are exalted by heating the metals; but let them be kept
in contact sufficiently long to amalgamate, and the compound
gives no signs of electricity. I could mention a great number
of other instances of pure chemical action-in which I have used
all the means in my power to ascertain the fact, and the result
has been constantly the same. In cases of effervescence, in-
deed, particularly when accompanied by much heat, the metallic
vessels employed become negative, but this is a phanomenon
connected with evaporation, the change of state of a body inde-
pendent of chemical change, and is to be referred to. a different
law,*

* The change of the capacities of bodies in consequence of the alteration in their
volumes, or states of existence by heat, is a continually operating source of electrical
effects: and' as I have hinted, page 36, it often interferes with the results of ex-
periments on the clectrical energies of bodies as exhibited by contact, It is like-
wise probably one of the sources of the capricious results of experiments of friction,
