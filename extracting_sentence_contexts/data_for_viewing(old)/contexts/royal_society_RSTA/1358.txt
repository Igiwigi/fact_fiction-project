where n is the director and nt -n=0, |nt|=1. That is, the LCE sheet has a contraction 4 <1
along the director and an elongation 4~” along n+ with the optothermal Poisson ratio v. Despite
having the intrinsic metric change locally, it is still difficult to determine the macroscopic shape
change of the entire pattern, but symmetry helps. Figure 4a describes the canonical example of
shape-programming with LCEs [29-31]. Top, in the figure, is a circular director pattern in which
the director is parallel to the concentric circles. The actuated state is a cone that respects the
symmetry and the metric change. Specifically, the circumference 27r contracts by a factor 4 and
the in-material radius r extends by 1”, since they are parallel or perpendicular to the director. Then
the cone angle is given by y =arcsin 4+”, as depicted in figure 4a. This induces the following
cone deformation that encodes all the facts mentioned above and maps the reference domain to
a cone:

y,(x) =Ar(ey — cot ves), (3.19)

where x = re; = r(cos 0e; + sine) is the position on the circular pattern in which (r,6) are the
corresponding polar coordinates, and {e1, 2, e3} is the standard orthonormal basis for R°.

As shown in [32], this basic design can be used as a building block for a large class of
non-isometric origami: Two circular patterns with bisecting straight-line interface can form two
equal-height cones with parallel axes after actuation, as depicted in figure 4b. Furthermore,
symmetrically patterned circular patterns with bisecting interfaces can form objective non-isometric
origami in figure 4c—e. We construct three examples by applying the two-dimensional translation
