of floating Bodies, and the Stability of Ships. 53

To. put this matter. in a clear point of view, let a case be
assumed. Suppose two vessels to be of the same weight and
dimensions in every respect, except that the sides of one of
these vessels shall project more than those of the other, the
projections commencing from the line coincident with the
water's surface. According to the theorems of BouGutk and
other writers, the stability will be the same in both ships, which
is in fact true, on the supposition that their inclinations from
the perpendicular are extremely small angles : but when the
ships heel to 15* or 20, the stabilities of the two vessels must
evidently be very ditterent. Even supposing the stability of a
Ship A to be greater than that of a ship B, when the angles of
heeling are very small, it may happen in cases easily supposable
that when both ships are heeled-to a considerable angle of in-
clination, the stability of the ship B shall exceed that of the
ship A. Admitting, therefore, that the theory of statics can be
applied with any effect to the practice of naval architecture, it
seems to be necessary that the rules investigated for determin-
ing the stability of vessels should be extended to those cases
in which the angles of inclination are of any magnitude likely
