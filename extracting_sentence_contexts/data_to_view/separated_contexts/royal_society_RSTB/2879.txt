Speaking in a general way, the
intrafilamentar septum is common among the Filibranchia, and occurs in two Pseudo-
lamellibranch families—Spondylide and Pectinide, So far as present observations
go, it is met with in none of the Eulamellibranchia except Lyonsia nitida and Astarte
borealis. In those cases where the filaments are in organic connection, either of an inter-
lamellar or interfilamentar kind, the chitin also is continuous. These connections are
mainly of loose lacunar tissue, covered by epithelium; and extremely thin films of
chitin cover the lacunar cells, and, in fact, form a sponge-work in which the cells are
embedded. The continuity of this chitin with the thicker chitin of the filaments can
be easily made out in well preserved and well stained material. Tn those Lamellibranchia with organic interfilamentar junctions (¢.e., the Eulamelli-
branchia plus the Pinnide, Ostreide, and Limidze—an assemblage which it is
proposed to term the Synaptorhabda, see p. 186), the chitin in these junctions is
remarkably thick and fibrous in character.
