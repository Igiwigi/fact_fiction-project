For example, if sheep had broken into a plantation and eaten enough grass the voles
would have starved, migrated or become exposed to other risks. Or there might have been
human interference or catastrophes such as flooding. Such accidents would no doubt
have produced different effects from those resulting from the causes of periodic mortality;
but if only the fact of decrease were known and its specific features had not been studied
then accidents could not be eliminated as possible causes. Since the decrease has been
defined as typically periodic these events would obviously destroy the ‘standing causal
conditions’ implicit in the statement of every hypothesis relating cause and effect. There-
fore, whatever the practical complications, no logical obstacles are raised when accidents
occur.
