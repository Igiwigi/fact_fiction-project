the unmeasured components. An example of this would be when only the fast components of the
system are measured, which can go around their projected attractor many times for one orbit of
the whole system.

In general, the presence of an attractor is not a problem for ruling our bad choices of x9, which
are well away from Xo. This is because although all trajectories approach the attractor, the ones
well away from Xo will be out-of-phase with the true trajectory, and so ‘miss’ the measurements.
There is an exception, however. Quasi-periodic forcing can cause the trajectories to synchronize
in oscillating systems, i.e. to move towards each other in the state space, as shown in figure 2.
This means that the likelihood function can have pronounced peaks even well away from Xo.
In our glacial cycle application, the orbital forcing, which varies solar insolation in the Northern
Hemisphere, has exactly this effect, and hence our likelihood function for Xo is both extremely
peaky, and also not concentrated around Xp. In fact, the situation can be more complicated still,
as there may be several local pullback attractors at any given time.

The presence of many local maxima implies that the basin of attraction of the global
maximum of the likelihood function, which will contain Xo with high probability, is only a small
fraction of the volume of 4. Hence, we are unlikely to find the global maximum of the likelihood
using steepest ascent from an arbitrary starting point. If we attempt to address this by using
multiple starting points, then we will not succeed unless we can afford sufficient starting points
that their nearest-neighbour distances are less than the diameters of the basins of attraction of the
maxima; and unless V has small dimension this is impractical.
