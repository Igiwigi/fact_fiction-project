Combining this with (3.2), we obtain

for n large enough, proving the desired estimate with Cy,) = (—2ac)!/"/2. a

This property for the minimizers of this very repulsive case is similar to H-stability in statistical
mechanics [44], where the minimal distance between two particles is expected to be constant
when 1 is large, and crystallization occurs. This also suggests that the lower bound O(n! *2/@) is
not sharp, which is verified in figure 2.

In fact, numerical experiments in [12,38] suggest that confinement happens for —1 <a <1.
It is an open problem to obtain a uniform bound in the support of the discrete minimizers as
in §2 in this range. In the range a < —1, our numerical simulations suggest that spreading of
the support happens for all y, with a decreasing spreading rate as y increases. For hard-core
potentials considered in [33-36], the crystallization can be rescaled to a macroscopic cluster with
uniform density; however, the scaling relation seems to have a more delicate dependence on the
parameters when a < 2.


(b) Uniqueness of global minimizers

We turn now to the issue of uniqueness (up to isometry) of global discrete and continuum
minimizers. In general, a large number of discrete minimizers (partially due to symmetries) are
