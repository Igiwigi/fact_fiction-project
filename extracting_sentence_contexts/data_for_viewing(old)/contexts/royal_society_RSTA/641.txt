reality may have to be causal, because, as Wittgenstein contended, we cannot conceive of
processes that are not causal [24, p. 175]. However, even if one adopts a weaker view, which
only precludes a representation of this reality, causality is difficult and ultimately impossible to
maintain because in order to do so one requires a sufficient representation, analogous to that
which obtains in classical physics [25]. Schrodinger expressed this difficulty, albeit by way of a
very different assessment of the type of argumentation just outlined, which he saw as ‘a doctrine
born of distress’, in his cat-paradox paper. He said: ‘if a classical state [defined by the ideally
definite position and the definite momentum of an object at any moment of time] of an object
does not exist at any moment, it can hardly change causally’ [26, p. 154]. I need, however, to
define causality.

Causality as understood in this article (and by Schrédinger here) is an ontological category—
part of reality. It relates to the behaviour of physical systems whose evolution is defined by the fact
that the state of a given system is, at least as idealized by a given theory and model, determined at



all moments of time by their state at a particular moment of time, indeed at any given moment of 1s |
time. This concept is in accord with Kant’s principle of causality, which states (this statement of the
principle has been commonly used since) that if an event takes place, it has a [determinable] cause
of which it is an effect [22, pp. 305, 308]. Quantum phenomena violate this principle, because no
determinable event or process could ever be established as the necessary cause of a given event,
and only statistical correlations between certain events could be ascertained. Accordingly, the
concept of causality just defined may be more properly designated ‘classical causality’. However,
given that most of my discussion of causality concerns classical causality, and I shall refer by
