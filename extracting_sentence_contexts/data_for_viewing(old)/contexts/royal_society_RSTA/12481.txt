inch, the following proportion obtains between the weight of steam thrown down by
the vessel and the weight of steam precipitated by the contained air :—

B and its catchwater weigh nearly 100 grms. Its specific heat may be taken
as 0°094. Over the range of 85° the condensation of B is therefore just 1°5 grms.
The air in B weighs 4-2854 grms. Its condensation is 0°116 grm. Thus one-thirteenth
of the precipitation is due to the air. But as we must be content to use the sphere B
at pressures lower than this but still too high for sphere A, it is necessary to regard
the ratio as descending as low as one to eighteen.

Forestalling speculations on the possibility of dealing with this one-thirteenth, say,
to one per cent. of its value—or to yylypth of the whole condensation, I give the
results of an entire series of six experiments in which this ratio holds, in fact the
series from which—taken at random—I have borrowed the foregoing figures. The
mass of air, 4:2854 grms., affords over the mean range of 84°52 a precipitation of
0°11629 grm. There is a want of balance between the thermal capacities of the
vessels, making the observed precipitation 0°15217 grm. These are the mean results
of the six experiments. To compare the experiments among themselves I divide the
weights of precipitation observed in each case by the range of temperature for that
experiment. The six numbers thus obtained represent the weight of steam thrown
