ORIGIN OF THE CALCAREOUS CONCRETIONS KNOWN AS “COAL BALLS.” 177

At the time his paper was written Srrawan had not recognised the connection
existing between this phenomenon and the “ coal balls” of the Upper Foot Mine; in
fact, he states that the case is “unique in the fact that the place of the coal is taken
by dolomite, and that the change takes place within the distance of a few yards.”*
Unfortunately the seam is now quite worked through, and is lost for ever in the
back workings of the mine, but owing to the kindness of Mr. Puarr, the Manager,
’ who had supplied Mr. Strawan with information, and who volunteered all the
additional help he could give, specimens were obtained. With these specimens, the
facts Mr. Piarr could affirm, and the use of the original slides and hand specimens
kindly lent to us by the Geological Survey, it became clear that in the Wirral mine
a process had taken place which is almost identical in essence with that which formed
the “coal balls,” but that owing to local conditions it appears superficially very
different.

According to the manager of the mine, the first unusual character observed in the
coal was the appearance of a number of “ pea-” or “shot-” like balls of stone.
These we figure in fig. 8, Plate 18, and it will be seen that they are concretions,
smaller than, but otherwise very similar to, those found in the mines containing
“coal balls.” They contained plant tissue more or less perfectly petrified, as is to
be seen in fig. 5, Plate 12, of Mr. Srrawan’s paper, though the tissue is not so
well preserved as is general in the larger bullions, and they may be directly
