function. In the present species, however, as above mentioned, the elliptic vesicles do
not appear to find their way into the spermathecw. x

M. Fapne, to whose excellent paper I have already 80 often alluded, made, with
reference to some Chilopods, the very curious observation that the male spins a sort of
nest. or rather web of silk, and deposits in the middle a drop of semen, He has not

able instinct to visit these nests, and in some manner absorb the contents into their
vagina.
