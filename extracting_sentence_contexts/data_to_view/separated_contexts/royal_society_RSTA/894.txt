However, we can see the motivation for this approach if we look at
the experimental results in the modal basis (figure 3a). In this basis, most of the motion occurs
in the second extended mode and in the localized mode. In fact, these modes hold around 90%
of the systemâ€™s energy (figure 3b). Therefore, we can restrict our description to these two modes
without incurring a significant error. To construct this reduced description, we consider equation
(5.5) for the indices m = E and m=L, where E and L are the mode numbers corresponding to the
localized and second extended modes, respectively.
