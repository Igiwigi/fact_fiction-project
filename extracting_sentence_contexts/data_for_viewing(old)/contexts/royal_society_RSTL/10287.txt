and allowed to roll over in fluid under the microscope, the form and arrangement are
found to be somewhat as sketched in fig. 12 (Plate 43), where « represents the view
from below, b that from the side, and c an end elevation of the structure. The cell A,
in fact, is becoming gradually enfolded by the layer of cells derived from B, a process
which results, at a Jater period (Plate 43, fig. 17) in the almost complete tucking in
of the © core” as the centre of a snbglobular mass of cells.

As this process of © invagination by epiboly ” (as ib would be termed in the case of

an embryo) goes on, the * core ” has been more slowly cub up into cells—-at first by
walls perpendicular to its long axis, and then by septa in other planes at right angles
—and the sub-globular body thus produced lies with the open part towards the
epidermis.
After this period, two events occur : 1st, the cells of the * core,” possessing very
thin walls, acquire a different aspect from those of the outer shell; their finely
granular protoplasm makes them appear denser and more opaque, shining through the
