(66, p. 62) also discriminated between the calcified rods and the chitin thickenings,
but since he failed to note PosyEr’s confusion, he alluded to the former as the ‘ well-
known Stiibehen of the German authors.” The best account of them is that given by
JANSSENS (89, p. 56), who called them “ baguettes calcifiées,” and showed that they
are composed of calcium phosphate, with a little calcium carbonate, and a chitin
or conchylin base which remains after the removal of the calcium salts by dilute
acids.

They are not continuous rods of uniform width extending the full height of the
2 demibranch, but consist of a succession of short rods which taper off to nothing in the
middle of each interfilamentar junction. The length of each rod is thus slightly less
than the mean distance between one interfilamentar junction and the next above it.
This fact is easily demonstrated by soaking in 10 per cent. potassic hydrate for
24 hours a piece of the lamella of the Anodonta or Unio gill, and examining in
glycerine under the low power of the microscope; but it is also apparent in a
continuous series of sections taken transversely to the filaments. As an interfilamentar
; junction is approached the sections of the rods become smaller and smaller, and in the
middle of the interfilamentar junction are wanting entirely. The rods are extremely
brittle, and in sections taken as above the pieces are frequently seen dislocated and
thrown on their sides, especially if the section is thicker than the width of the rod
and if the razor employed was at all dull. According to Simpson (94, p. 182, and
Plate 7, fig. 1), Janssens (39, p. 58, and figs. 44 and 55), and Peok (66, p. 62), the
rods persist, in an attenuated form, through the interfilamentar junctions. This may
possibly be true in old specimens, but it was not the case in the numerous examples
examined for the purposes of this research. Huss.ina, it may be noted, spoke of the
