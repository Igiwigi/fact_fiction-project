Figure 1. Generation and phenotype of mice with a general (ARKO) or Sertoli cell-selective (SCARKO) knockout of the
androgen receptor. (a) Female mice, heterozygous for an AR allele with a floxed exon 2 (AR®™*’*; loxP sites are indicated
as red arrowheads) were crossed either with PGK-Cre mice, expressing the Cre recombinase ubiquitously, or with AMH-
Cre mice, expressing Cre selectively in SC, to generate ARKO or SCARKO mice, respectively. (6) SCARKO mice have nor-
mally descended testes (t) that are markedly reduced in size (28% of control). Ductus deferens (dd), seminal vesicles (sv)
and prostate (p) are normally developed. ARKO mice have very small testes that are located intraabdominally and male acces-
sory sex tissues are absent.
