Clearly, we always have 0 < M,q < M5 <a. The Minkowski dimension of L (or, equivalently, of its boundary 32), denoted by Dy = Dm(L),
is then given by Dy := inf{d > 0: M3 < 00} = sup{d > 0: M% = +00}. In fact, Dm is the unique real
number, such that M%=-+00 for d< Dm and M7 =0 for d> Dm (e.g. [7,23-26]). Physically, it
can be assumed as a critical exponent as it gives information about the behaviour of V(¢) as
a power of e. In the sequel, for brevity and in light of the aforementioned identity D=Dy,
we will use D instead of Dy to denote the Minkowski dimension of £.
