shows what happened when a square glass had a piece of metal with holes cut in it
pressed against it. In front of each opening in the screen there is a clear space on
the plate. Another curious, but very complicated effect is produced by cutting a

re-entering angle out of a square of copper. It is difficult to follow how the deposit
can form in the way shown in fig. 22a.
Bearing on this same point is the fact that if a warmed plate be placed on the

the whole length of the plate a small one be set up, a piece of glass 5 millims. wide,
for instance, the same kind of action occurs, the plate immediately behind the screen

is protected, and there a deposit of dust forms, of a curious rounded shape (fig. 23).
