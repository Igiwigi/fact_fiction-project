Development of Bone.â€”Temporary cartilage, when it first appears in the embryo,
consists of an aggregation of closely packed nucleated cells, which in the process
of growth become separated by the development of a tissne external to them,
usually designated the hyaline tissue of cartilage. At this stage of growth we
have a granular cell occupying a cavity in the hyaline tissue; at a previous period
the granular cell was inclosed by an outer cell-wall, to which it formed the nucleus,
but now the cell-wall has merged into the hyaline tissue, from which it can no
longer be distinguished, while the granular cell contains itself one or more nuclei.
In making sections of cartilage many of these granular cells escape from their
cavities in the hyaline tissue, and may be seen detached and floating about in the
field of the microscope. Some little confusion of terms has arisen in connexion
with this part of the subject. The granular cells are not unfrequently described
under the name of cartilage-nuclei containing nucleoli, while in fact they are cells
capable of separation from the matrix, and are at one period the only recognisable
cartilage cells. They occur singly or in groups, more frequently however two or
three are extended in a line. It is proposed in the present communication to call

these bodies granular cartilage cells, as distinguished from a form which the cells
assume previous to ossification. Cartilage previous to its conversion into bone under-
goes a rapid growth, which takes place principally in the direction of the long axis
of the future bone. Fach granular cell becomes divided into two by segmentation
transverse to the line of ossific advance. 'These are again divided, and the process
