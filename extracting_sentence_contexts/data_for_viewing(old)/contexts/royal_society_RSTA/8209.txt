1.7. In view of the very large part of the globe which is covered by water, it is
desirable to examine further the extent to which the oceans shield the core from the
varying outer field. This can be done by considering one or more limited oceans of
simple form, bounded, say, by meridians across which current cannot flow.7

1.8. It is desirable also to make a detailed examination of the induced part of the
field of magnetic storms, to determine whether it is really consistent with the properties
of the conducting core as deduced from the daily magnetic variations. It is hardly to
be expected that this will be the case, because the supposed uniformly conducting core
can only be regarded as a convenient mathematical model consistent with certain
observed facts ; it may suffice, with certain values of « and the radius, for one type
of magnetic variation, while for another type different values may be necessary. If so,
the difference between the two sets of values may indicate how the actual core differs
from the simple model.

1.9. This question forms the main subject of the present paper, which is a further
development of that by Cuapman and Wurrenean, already referred to. Mathematically
all such discussions are based upon Lamp’s work on electromagnetic induction in
spheres*; the theory for a uniform conducting sphere is complete as regards induction
