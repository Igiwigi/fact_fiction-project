spring to the population and its fitness costs and benefits
contribute less to invasion fitness. In the case of sterile subor-
dinates (analogous to sterile female workers in eusocial
insects), s = 0 and these individuals can contribute to any fit-
ness benefit bg received by the dominant at any direct cost c,
to themselves. This is analogous to the case of somatic cells
in a multicellular organism that contribute no ‘offspring’ and
may benefit the germ cells at any cost to themselves.

The essential role of reproductive value in averaging
inclusive fitness effects across different classes of individuals,
such as subordinates and dominants, in equation (3.1) high-
lights the fact that invasion fitness cannot ‘belong’ to any
one individual since individuals belong to only one class at
a time. Rather, fitness can only be measured at the gene line-
age level where gene lineages pass through each class over
time as they are transmitted repeatedly from parents to off-
spring. Thus, statements regarding the inclusive fitness of
any single class of individual, such as a worker or queen,
are necessarily incomplete as they cannot determine whether
a gene is under positive selection resulting in the corres-
ponding trait becoming better adapted. This suggests that
arguments that the ‘individual organism is the privileged
unit of adaptation’ (e.g. [33,34]) are problematic since one
cannot, for example, view solely the queen or the worker in
