ceelic body cavity in the adult is foreshadowed by the reduction of embryonic ccelom.
The retention of conspicuous coelomic cavities in embryos of Orthoptera must be regarded
as a vestigial feature. In comparing the differentiation of mesoderm in Carausius and
Pieris Wiesmannâ€™s Blutzellenlamelle corresponds exactly to what I have called median
mesoderm, both giving rise to transverse muscles and to blood cells. The subsomitic
mesoderm in Pieris corresponds with the ventral medial ccelom and the inner and
outer medial diverticula of Carausius, which gives rise to intrinsic and extrinsic muscles
of the leg and longitudinal muscles of the body wall.

In the dorso-lateral portion of the ccelom of Carausius we have obviously the nearly
exact counterpart of the somitic portion of mesoderm in Pieris. Slight differences,
difficult to explain, lie in the different positions from which the fat body arises and the
fact that in Pieris there is no connection between visceral mesoderm and that which
gives rise to the ventral longitudinal muscles. Allowing, however, for the greater
development of coelomic space in Carausius than in Pieris there is substantial agree-
ment between the accounts given of the fate of the mesoderm in these two insects.

In the fourth and fifth abdominal segments, at the stage shown in fig. 4, certain large
spherical cells are seen in the lower part of the inner somite wall (fig. 22). These are the
germ cells which, retaining contact with both splanchnic mesoderm and fat cells at this
stage, prevent that wide cleavage suffered by the somite in other segments. Surround-
ing elements soon form an envelope of flattened cells, and these are continued forward
as a fine cord on each side of the body as far as the second abdominal segment, where
they terminate in contact with the lower side of the cells forming the heart rudiment.
I have been unable to determine whether the germ cells differentiate in situ or whether
