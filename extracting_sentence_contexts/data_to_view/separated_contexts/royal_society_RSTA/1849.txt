ยง16. Conclusion. We have now established a formula of fractional type for the longitudinal aberration
of a symmetrical system which, while algebraically correct as far as the second order,
does in fact, give results beyond this order in those numerical cases which have been
tried, and largely overcomes the difficulties of slow convergency in critical regions. SPHERICAL ABERRATION FOR A SYMMETRICAL OPTICAL SYSTEM. 71

We have further obtained a method for calculating the coefficients of this formula
for any symmetrical optical system in terms of the coefficients for the components,
in such a way that the effect of any single component upon the whole combination is
immediately obtained.
