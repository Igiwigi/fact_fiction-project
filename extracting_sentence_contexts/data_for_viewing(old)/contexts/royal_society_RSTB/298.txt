CoMPARISON OF THE PreRopAcTyL BRAIN witH THOSE oF Brrps AND Lizarps.

In an upper or in a side view of the brain of a Reptile one sees behind the cerebral
hemispheres a pair of more or less rounded optic lobes, and behind these again the
single rounded cerebellum. This separation of the cerebrum from the cerebellum by
the optic lobes occurs in all Reptiles, although the form and proportions of the parts
way vary; thus in Chelonians the cerebrum is elongated, while in Alligators it is
Munded and globose.
2The most striking characteristic of a Bird’s brain as compared with that of any

tbptile is its much larger size in proportion to the bulk of the skull, The brain of a
kird seen from above seems, at first sight, to have no optic lobes, for directly behind
Be inflated cerebrum there is the cerebellum ; the latter has, in fact, increased in
se, and grown forwards between the optic lobes, which have thus been pressed
oftwards and downwards. At the same time the cerebrum has also enlarged, and,
pressing backwards, has overlapped the optic lobes and shut them out from forming
aay part of the upper surface of the brain. In a side view, however, the optic lobe is
seen as a rounded body quite at the lower part of the brain, and almost hidden by
t&e cerebrum, Another peculiarity of the Bird’s brain is the process from each side of
the medulla, which occupies the fossa on the inner side of the periotic capsule, and is

ed the flocculus. I am not aware of this having been observed in Reptiles.

eThe brain of Scaphognathus Purdoni, it will be seen, agrees with that of the
Fpptile in its small size in proportion to the skull, in the relatively large size of the
