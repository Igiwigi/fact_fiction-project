By continuity, there exists
aT’, possibly smaller than the choice above, such that for all t € [0, T’] we know ||Q’(4Il3,(@,q) is
sufficiently small and the determinant is bounded away from zero. Next, we set ||H||pom(D)nDom(B) = |!DH1I3,(Q;2) + BH |l3,@Q@;2) for any H € Dom(D) N Dom(B),
while || - |lop denotes the operator norm for bounded operators on Q. We observe that for any
néN we have

IP(E(Q')" IlDom(DynDom(B) < IP (E)LDom(D) Dom) l(Q’(é))" llop
IIPOIlDom(DynDomiBy|IQ'(Hllop
IPO lDom(DynDomiBy IQ’ HII, (a,0)-

Hence we observe that

P(t) (« + Zener")
n>1 Dom(D)NDom(B)

< IP lIbom(DynDom(B) (: +0 121,00)
n>1

< IPO libom(DynDom(y (1 = 1Q(H)l3(@:0))" |

Hence using the operator series expansion for (id + Q’(t))~! we observe we have established that
IP(@Gd + Q'(H)" IDomoynDom(s) < POIlDom(oyrDomB) (1 — IQ’ Hll3a¢@-a))

Hence there exists a T’ > 0 such that for each t € [0, T’] we know G(t) = P(t)(id + Q’(#))~! exists, is
unique, and in fact G € C™([0, T’]; Dom(D) N Dom(B)). a

Remark 2.5 (Initial data). We have already remarked that we set Q’(0) =O so that Q(0) =id. Consistent with the Riccati relation we hereafter set P(0) = G(0).
