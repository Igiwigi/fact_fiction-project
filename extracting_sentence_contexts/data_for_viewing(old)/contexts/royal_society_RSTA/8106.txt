The points of maximum pressure are distinguished from the points of minimum pressure
by the fact that at a point of maximum pressure, the tooth approaches the socket as a result
of the displacement, while at a point of minimum pressure. the tooth recedes from the socket.

These results are illustrated in fig. 5, in which the arrows indicate the directions in
which the pressure increases.

Fig. 5.

If the displacement of the tooth is a pure translation, we cannot choose the origin
at the centre of rotation, which is at infinity. Jt is convenient to choose the origin
temporarily at the centre of mass of the fictitious wire, so that by (70)

Since « is zero in the present case, (71) becomes

and the pressure gradient is

Hence we may state the result :
