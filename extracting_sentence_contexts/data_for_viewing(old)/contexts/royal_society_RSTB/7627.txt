(CG and D), (ii) the infilling of peaty silts, calcareous muds and peats (M) of a deep
channel cut into the gravel across the pit, (iii) a general blanket of peat covering the
gravels and channel deposits alike, (iv) discontinuous masses of peat, organic silts, etc.
(AB4, B4), embedded at varying depths in the gravel of the channel, all parts of a formerly
continuous deposit.

The deepest and oldest of the plant-bearing deposits are the rafts of ‘Arctic Bed’ which
contain the remarkable fauna and flora described in past years from many situations in
the Lea Valley.

The botanical investigations to be described make use equally of pollen analysis and
of identification of larger plant material, called conveniently ‘macroscopic remains’,
although microscopy is in fact constantly used in their identification. The investigations
do not concern the Arctic Bed except by comparison in discussion; they deal, however,
with all the other categories of organic deposit, with much the greatest stress upon the
layers still in place.

It may be said at once that pollen analysis of the channel infilling shows a continuous
sequence of deposition extending back from the Post-Glacial climatic optimum (Atlantic)
to the relatively tree-less birch-pine period of the Late-Glacial at which time the base
of the channel became filled with silty muds which incorporate not only a striking assem-
blage of pollen, but a very extensive range of fruits, seeds, leaves and other identifiable
macroscopic material. The establishment by this means of the character of Late-Glacial
vegetation in this part of south-east England is one of the most important aspects of the
investigation, but the pollen analyses of course equally serve to date the faunal remains
