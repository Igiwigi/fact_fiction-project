Tf the surface is quite dry and still covered with the fine powder resulting from
the process of roughening, the splash is “ rough,” and a great bubble of air is
taken down. But if this coat of powder, which has neither cohesion nor shearing
strength, be removed by rubbing, the splash (under this low velocity) is “ smooth.”
Again, a marble freshly sand-papered and covered with the resulting powder, if
let fall from 12 or 15 centims., gives a rough splash. The same marble picked
out of the liquid and very quickly dropped in again from the same height, will
give again a rough splash. Here the liquid film is thick and “shearable.” But
if the same sphere be allowed to drain or be lightly wiped, the splash will be
smooth. Here we may conjecture that enough fluid is left to fill up the inter-
stices, but that the coat is not thick enough to shear easily. If, however, the
sphere be thoroughly dried the splash becomes “rough” again. This gives us the
explanation of the facts already recorded in respect of the splash of a wet sphere
(Series VII. of Paper I.). This splash was always irregular ; the liquid drifted to one
side where it would shear, while it disappeared from the other or became there too
thin to shear, though sufficient to fill up crevices.

Explanation of the Flutings.

The fact thus established experimentally, that the surface of a smooth sphere must
be rigid if the film is to envelope it closely, suggests what seems a satisfactory
explanation of the flutings. For it suggests that, even while the film is exceedingly
