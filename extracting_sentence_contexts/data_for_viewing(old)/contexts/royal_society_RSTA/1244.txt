higher dose rates. In the case of low-dose CTEM, imaging is usually carried out using an electron
flux of less than 10 e~ /(A?s). Comparatively for STEM, imaging and analysis is carried out with
a much higher localized probe flux on the order of 108 e~ /(A’s) fora 1.4A probe size and 60 pA
probe current, even when taking into account beam broadening. Note here that we are referring to
the probe flux and not the average flux per pixel, where the latter is commonly reported and can
be orders of magnitude smaller than the localized probe flux. If the rate of damage of a specimen
is indeed diffusion limited, then it may be possible to use a higher electron flux (as in STEM) to
obtain a better SNR for a given level of damage. This analysis assumes that the flux in low-dose
CTEM corresponds to the linear portion of the schematic in figure 4a and the localized STEM
probe flux relates to the region at which the dose rate versus damage rate curve plateaus and
hence the damage per unit fluence (i.e. the gradient of the curve) is lower.

Here, we also note that damage is in fact delocalized around the STEM probe (figure 4b),
typically over a radius of 3-5nm for the low energy electronic excitations responsible for
