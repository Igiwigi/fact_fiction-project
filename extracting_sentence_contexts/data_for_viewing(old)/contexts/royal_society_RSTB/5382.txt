above there are two foramina in the basilar artery, indicating its origin by fusion of a
bilaterally arranged network.

The Branches of the Vertebral and Basilar Arteries.

The anterior spinal artery arises on either side from the vertebral artery at the level
of the second last hypoglossal rootlet, immediately cranial to the site of origin of the
posterior inferior cerebellar artery, which passes between the last two rootlets of this
nerve. In Echidna the stems of origin of the anterior spinal artery are remarkable for
their large size ; being in fact as large as the vertebral artery itself. This question of
size has an important bearing on the distribution of blood to the higher centres of the
brain. In man, from the experiments of Moxon “ there is good reason to conclude that
the anterior spinal fills from above downwards *’ (1881); whereas here in Echidna one
is justified in assuming that the longitudinal channel fills from the opposite direction.
This difference in direction of blood flow indicates how a channel, originally designed
to enhance the distribution within one functional area, may be called upon to assist in
supplying the demands of a more distant area—in the case of Echidna the posterior
cerebral area—without in any way losing its identity and original function. The stems
of origin of the anterior spinal artery arise at approximately the same level in all the
specimens examined. In the specimens, other than that figured, the anterior spinal
stems were somewhat smaller than the vertebral artery, nevertheless they were of con-
siderable size. The two stems pass inwards and caudally to join with one another at
