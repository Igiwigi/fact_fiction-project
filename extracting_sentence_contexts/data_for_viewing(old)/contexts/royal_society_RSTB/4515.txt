of four minutes’ rest, at the end of which time the hyperpnoea had greatly diminished,
though it had by no means ceased, the work was begun again. Three minutes later
the respiratory exchange was determined over a period of 45 seconds, and then the
subject stopped work. The after-effect of the work was followed for 85} minutes.

It will be seen that, in spite of the fact that the work had already lasted for a
total of seven minutes, and that there had been, in addition, an interval of four
minutes between the two periods of work, the CO, output is still above the oxygen
consumption, and the respiratory quotient above unity, when the determination of
the respiratory exchange waS made just before stopping the work.

In the first minute afteét the stop of the work, there is only a comparatively small]
drop in the respiratory exchange, though there is a big diminution in the succeeding
minute and a-half, and a considerable further fall in the next three minutes. The
