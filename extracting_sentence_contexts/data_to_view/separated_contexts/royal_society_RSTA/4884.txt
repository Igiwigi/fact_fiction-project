One particularly significant example is that the qualitative picture of
the nonlinear energy transfer in the weak turbulence limit persists in the limit of strong
turbulence [20]. In fact, there is a long history of linear wave properties being explicitly
or implicitly used to analyse spacecraft measurements and numerical simulations of plasma
turbulence [5,7,21-45]. In fact, as will be explained below, the linear and nonlinear dynamics of Alfvén waves are
responsible, at a very fundamental level, for some of the key qualitative features of plasma
turbulence that distinguish it from hydrodynamic turbulence, including the anisotropic cascade
of energy and the development of current sheets at small scales. In the opinion of this author,
to attempt a purely statistical investigation of plasma turbulence, analogous to the common
approach in hydrodynamic turbulence, without exploiting the plasma physics of the turbulent
fluctuations is bound to meet with moderate success at best. The current frontier of research on plasma turbulence in the weakly collisional solar wind is
framed by three fundamental questions:

‘Weak nonlinearity means that the magnitude of the nonlinear terms in the equations of evolution are small relative to the
magnitude of the linear term that supports the propagation of Alfvén waves.
