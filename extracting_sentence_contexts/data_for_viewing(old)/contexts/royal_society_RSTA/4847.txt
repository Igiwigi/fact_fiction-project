with arrangements of 0’s and 1’s is depicted in figure 2, top row. The far left (red) arrangement is
the seed arrangement of. The local rule ¢g associates 1 with all green points that are surrounded
by two, or three 1’s in the red seed arrangement. The next arrangement o@ consists of a green
pattern of 0’s and 1’s after application of ¢¢, while o} is the red arrangement obtained from og
after applying x which in this case equals ¢g. In the second row, the arrangements op and of
are shown under a single arrangement of o' for i= 0,1.

Given a finite n x n array size, and the initial oR seed arrangement, for any rules ¢p, 6c, the
arrangement sequence o°,c1,... is eventually periodic. This follows from the fact that there are
only a finite number of configurations and the transitions between the iterations are deterministic.
For the seed o° of figure 2, and the GoL-like system the sequence becomes periodic after the
first three iterations (figure 3). However, the GoL-like system seems to exhibit quite complicated
dynamics. Our initial experimentation on a 15 x 15 grid, as well as a 25 x 25 grid shows periodic
behaviour after hundreds (respectively, thousands) of iterations for some seeds.
