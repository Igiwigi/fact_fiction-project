From the figures Mr. Sremmerz gives, and from those which our own experiments
supply, it appears that within a certain range of values of B this formula may be
taken as giving a fairly close approximation to the real value of JH dI. As an
empirical formula of the kind is of use to designers of transformers, we have been
at some pains to examine how nearly and within what range a formula of this
type may be taken to represent the facts. It will suffice to refer to one example in
some detail. Taking Ring IV. (thin sheet iron) for which we have a numerous and very
consistent series of determination of {H dI, extending from B = 43 to B= 14,720,
we have tested the constancy of the index ¢ in the formula

[H dal = »B

by plotting log B in relation to log fH dl.
