notice also a marked difference between the curve when the moon is 8outh of the eq
(TI.) and the one when her declination is north (1IL.). A glance at the diagrams
convince us of this; we need only to point out that the range of oscillation in the
instance, taking both branches into consideration, is 27:35, in the last but 21-18,
that the extremes occur in the latter case two hours earlier than in the former. Besi
these differences there are others of minor import which also contribute towards drawin
a distinction between the curves for north and south declinations of the moon ; for i .
stance, the secondary extremes differ in the south curve by 24”:85, whilst the corre- |
sponding deviation in the north curve is but 13-20. &

On examining the results of this inquiry for the seyeral years of observation 80me-
what closer, we are struck by the differences which they exhibit among themselves. Tt
was the year 1861 which first called my attention to this fact by manifesting consider-
able abnormities with respect to every one of the curves of the lunar-diurnal variation
for the various seasons and poxsitions of the moon. 'These irregularities are the more
striking, as the year 1860 does not exhibit any such extraordinary deviations from the
mean values for the several years, although also in this case the curye for the winter half-
year shows some peculiarly interesting features (Plate XIX.).

The subjoined Table gives the lunar-diurnal variation for the years 1860 and 1861,
and Plate XIX. shows the respective curvyes.
