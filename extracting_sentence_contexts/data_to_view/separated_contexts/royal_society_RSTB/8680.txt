sense of the selection frame, but in fact all four frames are Dar- level, cultural evolution proceeds by way of attraction, of

in a broad sense and so is applying it to evolution; a focus possible way in which it might be modelled in future research.

on selection in explaining evolution is ‘Darwinian’ in a stan-
dard sense; and explaining heritability and its role in
selection in terms of replicators is ‘Darwinian’ in a rationally

reconstructed sense. For each of these frames, modelling is 2.
