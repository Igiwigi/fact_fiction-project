We define conventional oil as crude oil, condensate and NGLs and non-conventional
oil as tight oil, extra-heavy oil, oil sands and kerogen oil. Since tight oil is similar in chemical
composition to crude oil (while the other non-conventional oils are not), it could equally be
classified as conventional. We classify it as non-conventional here, to emphasize the fact that
tight oil is a new and rapidly growing source of liquid fuels that was historically excluded
from conventional oil resource estimates and production forecasts. Tight oil also differs from
conventional oil in both the geological characteristics of the resource and the methods of
production. The core issue for future supply is the extent and the rate of depletion of conventional oil,
since this currently provides around 95% of global all-liquids supply.
