performance and costs need to be balanced for the given system and application/network [18].

3. The fibre capacity crunch

At the system level, the historical capacity scaling, over four orders of magnitude, was
achieved in large part by a combination of transceiver capacity increases and long-distance
wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) of signals. The bandwidth-distance product of systems
steadily increased. Mid-link transceivers (that were responsible for optical-to-electrical-to-optical
conversion for signal regeneration) were replaced by optical amplifiers as the transmission
distances increased. Since a single optical amplifier has sufficient bandwidth to simultaneously
amplify tens of signals across the entire WDM band (e.g. the C band), considerable savings in
cost and energy could be achieved. More channels were added at higher data rates without a
significant change in cost or energy. In fact both the cost per bit and energy per bit scaled down
at exponential rates [19,20].

In recent years, however, the full band for erbium-doped fibre amplifiers, which are the
predominant amplifier in commercial systems, has become fully exhausted and the spectral
density of the transceivers is approaching the Shannon channel capacity limit. Likewise,


transmission distances have reached continental scales. This situation is often referred to as the
optical fibre capacity crunch [1]. Further growth through historical means is no longer possible.

The solution to the fibre capacity crunch is straightforward in concept, but very challenging to
realize. Continued capacity growth requires moving to multiple amplifier bands and/or multiple
