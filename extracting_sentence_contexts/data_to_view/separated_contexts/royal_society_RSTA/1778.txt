The USA had established its own National Atmospheric
Deposition Program (NADP) in 1977. The combination of a large source area in the Ohio River
valley and a large area downwind with geology and ecosystems sensitive to acidification soon led
to the recognition of problems from long-range transport of pollutants similar to those identified
in Europe. The fact that substantial areas of acid-sensitive ecosystems were located in Canada
added a political dimension similar to that in Europe, with one country being responsible for
ecological problems in a neighbouring territory.

10. 1980s Forest decline

By 1980 acid rain, or more correctly acid deposition, recognizing the importance of both wet and
dry deposition to the total input to the ground [78], was established as an international issue, and
all industrial countries engaged in research and many in the development of control measures. Interest in acid deposition in Europe was greatly stimulated in the early 1980s by a decline in
the health of forests in the most polluted regions [79]. The most damaged forests were those
in the uplands in border regions of the Czech Republic, Poland and the German Democratic
Republic where die-back of the forest was extensive.
