454 MR, W. C. WILLIAMSON ON THE MICROSCOPIC STRUCTURE OP THE

facts is, that Mr. Quzekerr's objection to the arrangement of the Lepidosiren amongst
fishes, as proposed by Professor Owen, derived from the form of its lacunze, is not a
valid one. On viewing the variety and complication in the arrangement of the elementary tissues
combining to form the scale of Megalichthys, it is difficult to resist the conclusion
that it must have been constructed on a very different plan to that followed in the
genera previously described.
