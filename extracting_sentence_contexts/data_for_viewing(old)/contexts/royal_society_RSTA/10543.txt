€ started I propose (nominis egestate) to call the retonation-wave. This wave has not
4the same constant characteristics that mark the detonation, but when generated
2 under certain conditions it resembles detonation most closely. Fig. 43 (Plate 14)
& shows a wave of retonation travelling parallel with and therefore at the same velocity
3 as the collision-wave. Fig. 44 shows a retonation-wave travelling more quickly than
g the wave reflected from the end of the tube. A study of a number of photographs
£ leads to the conclusion that the retonation is faster and more luminous when no other
Bbright waves have been thrown back by the advancing flame before the point of

& detonation is reached.

& In considering the cause of the intensity of the retonation-wave we must remember
3 the facts illustrated in many of our photographs on collisions. The collision of two
3 flames, in which detonation had not yet been determined, gave rise to reflected waves
q more rapid and more luminous than the incident waves. Fig. 25 shows this for both,
& Now these reflected waves could not owe their increased velocity to the mechanical
impact, which could only result in the reflected waves being copies of the incident
waves. It is evident then that chemical action must occur to assist these retlected
waves, and therefore the combustion is obviously not complete when these waves
return, From this it would appear probable that the period before the detonation is
distinguished not only by a slower propagation of the flame, 7.e., of ignition, but also
by a slower process of combustion. In the initial period the molecules of the gas
might meet many times before chemical reaction oecurred ; in the detonation-wave
the molecules might be so intensely agitated that most collisions between chemically
opposite molecules would result in chemical change.
