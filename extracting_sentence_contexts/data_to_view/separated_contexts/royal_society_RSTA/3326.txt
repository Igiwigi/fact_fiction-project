Up to three H atoms can be added per Ru atom in the
cluster, with an overall exothermic reaction, figure 5, in agreement with other estimates (e.g. for
H on Pt [60]). This clearly shows that the role of the Rujo cluster is to split the Hz molecule in
a barrierless process and to generate isolated H atoms that can diffuse to the oxide surface once
saturation coverage on the cluster has been reached, figure 5. In fact, direct spillover of hydrogen from the Ru particle to the oxide surface is unfavourable
at low hydrogen coverage. Two H atoms on the Ru cluster are 0.3-0.4eV more stable than one
H atom on the metal and the other on the oxide. The cost to displace H from Ru to the oxide,
however, decreases gradually as more hydrogen is adsorbed on the metal cluster.
