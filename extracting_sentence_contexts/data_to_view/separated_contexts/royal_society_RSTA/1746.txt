Whilst it cannot be denied
that Poyntrne’s theory is probably the most appropriate one yet formulated, yet it
must be recognised that there are an infinite number of fundamentally different forms
each of which is itself perfectly consistent with MAxwELt’s theory as expressed in his
differential equations of electromagnetic interaction. :

Again, but now we are on a different plane, it has usually been stated that
MAXwWELU's theory is not of sufficient generality to cover the cases where there exists
the complication of non-linear induction in ferromagnetic media.{ This view appears
to have originated with the idea that the magnetic force is the fundamental ethereal
vector of the magnetic field, whereas, as a matter of fact, the only consistent view §
of the energy relations of such a field leads to the conclusion that the magnetic
tmduction is the true ethereal vector, the magnetic force being an auxiliary vector
