Egg production expresses quantitatively the physiological level of activity of the ovarioles,
while the percentage of larvae going into diapause, although modified or completely altered
by the effects of various factors on the subsequent larval development, reflects qualitatively
the physiological state of the ovaries at the time of egg formation.

(ii) Rate of development

Since all the emergents from every dayâ€™s oviposition were noted together with dates of
emergence, data had only to be collected together suitably to demonstrate whether or not
there was, throughout the life of the parent female, any change of rate of development of
those eggs and larvae which produced emergents that could be correlated with the pro-
portion of the eggs producing larvae going into diapause. If this effect did in fact occur, it
might be obvious in two ways. (1) If we consider the total progeny of individual females in
any one temperature group we may find that some produce progeny of which a high
percentage enter diapause, while others produce progeny of which a low percentage enter
diapause; and in this case there might be a difference in the average developmental times
of the progeny not entering diapause in the two categories. (2) If there appeared any
variation in the developmental time of those individuals that did emerge from eggs laid at
different times during the life of the parent female, this might be correlated with variation
in the proportions of her progeny going into diapause.

It should be pointed out here that the results given below could not be attributed to
slight variations in the controlled temperatures, since these results are the sum of individual
experiments carried out at different times.
