trace distinctly displays the division into phloem and xylem. In the interior of the
leaf this distinction cannot be observed. â€˜This trace seems to terminate below the
apex of the leaf, and immediately above a point where the margin of the leaf
is more deeply lobed than usual. Close to the apex of this leaf, k, we discover the
organ to which I have given the name of adenoid, but which my French friends
designate the ligule. We see it again at h, h, in a similar position, in the vertical
sections through two leaves, figs. 20 and 21. We shall find this organ much more
perfectly developed, though in a different position, when we examine the leaves of

Lomatophloios. The fact to be noted here is that the peripheral termination of this
organ is at the prominent apex of each leaf.

I should next proceed to examine what I am convinced represents a series of
Halonial states of LZ. Harcourtii, but before doing so it becomes necessary to submit
to a careful enquiry what we must, in future, imply by the terms Halonia and
Ulodendron, and especially whether we can any longer use these terms as generic
names, or whether we must simply employ them as adjectives to indicate either a
preparation for, or the actual attainment, of the condition of special fruit-bearing
branches of any or all of the Lepidodendroid and Sigillarian plants.

I must first insist upon the recognition of some more definite characteristics
distinguishing Halonia from Ulodendron than we yet possess. In Part II. of my
