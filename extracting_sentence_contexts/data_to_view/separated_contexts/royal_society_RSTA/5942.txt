This is a major strength of the relaxed micromorphic model, since standard
homogenization techniques do not allow us to directly transfer anisotropy from the micro to
the macro scale [50,51], and often give rise to frequency-dependent homogenization relations
[32,35,38,52-55].

(a) A periodic metamaterial for acoustic wave control

The unit cell (figure 1) used in this work has already been introduced and characterized in [5,6]
and we recall its geometric and elastic properties in the table of figure 1. This unit cell has been
conceived for elastic waves control in the acoustic regime. In fact, dispersion curves for the
associated periodic metamaterials can be obtained via standard Bloch—Floquet analysis (black
dotted line in figure 2) and show a band-gap between 1725 and 2136 Hz. Standard Bloch—Floquet analysis is very effective in describing the metamaterial’s behaviour
when it is sufficiently large to be modelled as an infinite medium. However, it is not suitable
