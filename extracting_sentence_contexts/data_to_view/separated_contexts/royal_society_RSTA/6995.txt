The calculations can be carried on to any number of levels. In the vicinity of the transition
temperature there is practically no further change. Also the parameters ¢ do not become 1,
at any rate for temperatures for which 7 <0°8, in spite of the fact that for an infinite number
of levels ¢(x) =1 is a solution of equations (100) and (102). The change in the value of the transition temperature, according to Bethe’s method,
occurs therefore at the passage from two to three levels. Although we also expect to have
a decrease in the correct transition temperature, when the number of levels is increased, we
do not know whether this decrease will be as substantial as it is in Bethe’s approximation,
owing to the anomalous behaviour of the two-level problem in this approximation.
