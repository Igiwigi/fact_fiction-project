We believe (4.1) holds uniformly when the real parts of the shifts are < 1/log T
but the imaginary parts of the shifts can be large, as large as T!~¢ and even larger. This has not
been proved to hold for (4.1), but has been proved, as mentioned above, by Bettin [7] in the case
of the second moment. Now we use the fact that

Da p(s + 2) = Da+z,p+2(8)

and, assuming the uniform version of (4.1), replace [>° W(t/T)Da,a(s + 2)D),s(1 — s + w) dt in the
above by

0
| Wh) Zir(a+z,B+z,y +w,d +w) dt.
0

Next, note that

Zi(a+zB+zy+u,d+w)=Z(a+z+u,bB+z+u,y,8)

follows just from the symmetries of Z;. We now change variables with s =z + w and have

1 xs co
I(T; X) = ~—, —"*_T HZr(a +s,B +s;y,5)dtdwds + O(T7/3**).
a) (2xi? Wrocs Dons w(s — w) I, WO Zr(a +58 +s:7-3) ¢ )

We move the path of integration in the w-variable off to the left, to —oo, and collect the residue
from the pole at w = 0.
