The probability distribution of F can be defined as the probability measure on the Borel subsets
of R given by
P(B) = P(F~1(B)) = P{w € 2 : F(w) € B). Thus, if it exists, the expectation or mean E[F] of F is given by

E[F] =: | F(@)P(dw)

we
=| aPp(da).

The probability distribution is characterized by the family of expectations it yields for bounded
measurable functions f of F :

EI@l= I. (F®)(@)P(do)= igouco = [,forr(ar. In fact, the exponential functions are sufficient for this characterization, hence the characteristic
function op of F

is well named. One can imagine that, if Kolmogorov had been familiar with another book [2] published
slightly earlier, he might have wished to have written a different book. But we must assume that
he was unaware of the existence of quantum probability.
