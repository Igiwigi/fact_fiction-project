To half a gramme of pure albuminic acid dissolyed in 50 grammes
of water, *05 gramme of hydrate of soda was added (one-tenth of the weight of the
albumen), and the liquid was placed upon parchment-paper. No albumen could be
discovered in the diffusate of several days, but it gave +069 gramme of carbonate of
80da, equivalent to +053 gramme of hydrate of soda; that is the whole soda originally
Faded to the albumen. The separation of the soda from the albumen may possibly have
Heen aided by the presence of carbonic acid in the water, but certainly the entire separa-
fon of the alkali from albumen by diffusion through a colloidal film is a remarkable fact. Fydrate of potash was found to diffuse away from albumen in the same manner. = A solution of Znwulsin is precipitated by albuminic and gummic acids, but not by
Wpurified albumen or gum-arabic.
