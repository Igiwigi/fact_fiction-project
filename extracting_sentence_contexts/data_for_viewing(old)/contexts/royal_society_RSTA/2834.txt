But since p(x) € SO(3), we also have |c| = |d| and cd = 0, thus c=d=0. Similarly e=f =0, and
so a2 +b? =1 and g=1; that is, p(x) € T. Suppose p(x) =0 for all x € {a1,...,dg,b1,..., bg}. Then
p(a1),-- +, P(g), p(b1),.--, p(bg) € T. But then p(c) = Th, [e(aj), e(b;)] = 1 At, so in fact there are no
such p in V(t). Hence the section (sy,,.. “1Sags Sbyr ees Sb.) of L®8 is nowhere zero, so C2g(L®8) =

When n> 1, the combinatorics of the vanishing loci of the relevant sections becomes more
complicated. The key idea in the proof of theorem 1.2 is similar to that in our earlier paper [14],
but the combinatorics required in this case is more intricate.

The outline of the rest of this paper is as follows.

In §2, we prove the theorem for the case G = SO(5). As in [14], the proof begins by identifying
specific products of Chern classes which must vanish because there are sections (constructed
explicitly) of the relevant line bundles with no common zeros. The proof is completed by showing
