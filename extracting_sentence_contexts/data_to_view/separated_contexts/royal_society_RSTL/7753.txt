remarkable simplicity was given by Sir J. HErscneL in a very interesting review of
QuETELEr's © Letters on Probability,” which conducts to the same lay of error by means
of one or two bold assumptions ; but striking as the coincidence is, it can hardly be
seriously viewed as a demonstration; nor is it formally s0 presented by its distinguished
author. However, the methods both of Gavss and Sir J. HERsCHEL are of great interest
to the natural philosopher, as showing that certain & priori mathematical assumptions
of a very simple Kind lead to the same lay of error which reasoning based on a study of
the facts which surround us also points out as expressing, at least approximately, what
generally does occur in rerum naturd: though we can see no necessity that the facts
