and in my belief generically identical with it, I shall have occasion to show, that there is not only no proof of
the existence of such a limitation to its growth, but that there is strong evidence to the contrary.

phenomenon of their development, instead of being the result of accident.—I do not
wish toattach any weight to the interpretations I have here offered ; bat I simply state
the facts, and the explanations of them which have snggested themselves to my own
mind; merely adding, what I hope to present in more detail at a future opportunity,
that bodies resembling the first or primordial cell, in which Foraminifera of all forms
originate, are not unfrequently met-with in the chambers of many other species.

and in the thickness of the disk, arise directly from the degree in which the animal
Substance (whereon the skeleton is modelled) has extended itself either horizontally
Or vertically, $0 as to multiply either the number of concentric rings, or the number
f the superposed s8egments of which each ring consists. This, however, is not the
Snly source of variation in size; for a most extraordinary diversity presents itself in
