the one case as in the other. So far as tissue respiration was_concerned, therefore,
the conditions obtaining at Col d’Olen would only prove advantageous in so far as they
enabled the blood to yield up more than 55 per cent. of its oxygen, for this is about
the maximum amount with which it could readily part at the Margherita Hut.
Below 10 per cent. the blood would be reduced with considerable difficulty, whilst it
would not get oxidised much above 65 per cent., the alveolar pressure of oxygen
being 48 mm. in Ropers’ case at the Margherita Hut.

However interesting the aggregation of the hemoglobin molecules may be as
leading to an adaptation for the purpose of facilitating respiration, it is evident that the
phenomenon of aggregation, if it exists at all, has a much more far reaching interest
than this. So far as we know the acid causes aggregation of the molecules of hemo-
globin to take place in virtue of the fact that these molecules are protein molecules.
There is no reason to suppose that they stand alone among the proteins of the body in
respect of the effect of reaction upon them. Presumably their aggregation is typical
of some other proteins, whilst in others under conditions of acidosis the aggregates
would break down. We have a picture before us then of a change permeating
the whole system; where there was an average of 2°5 molecules in ‘clump before

there are now 3, where there were 3 clumps there are now but 2°5; every functional
process that is communicated by the impacts of the clumps must be altered, for
if there are fewer clumps there will be fewer impacts, but this is not all, for the
