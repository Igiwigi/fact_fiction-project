change in p, as at the boundary of a magnet, has to count. This force, the third term
in (187), explains the force on inductively — matter. It is in the direction
of most rapid decrease of p.

§ 31. Thirdly, let the stress be of the same simple type, but taking H instead of
R, H being the force of the flux B= pH =y(R+h,), where hy is as before

We now have

where jy = curl hy is the distribution of fictitious electric current which produces the

same induction as the intrinsic magnetisation phy, and J is, as before, the real current.
It is now quasi-electromagnetic force that acts on an intrinsic magnet, with,

however, the force due to yu, since a magnet has usually large » compared with air.

The above three stresses are all of the simple type (equal tension and perpendicular
pressure), and are irrotational, unless » be the eolotropic operator. No change is, in
the latter case, needed in (186), (188), whilst in the force formule (187), (189), the
