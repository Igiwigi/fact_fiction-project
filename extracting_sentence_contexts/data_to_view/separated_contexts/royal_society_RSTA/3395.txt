The effect of
a term of the first degree would be to make the lithosphere protrude from the geoid
towards one side. If this term were the only one, the land of the globe would form
a circular island or continent. It is the fact that most of the land is in one
hemisphere. The great circle of the globe which contains most land has a pole
situated between Orléans and Le Mans* (latitude 48° N., longitude 30’ E.). Again,
the zonal harmonic of the third degree vanishes at three circles, one being a great
circle.
