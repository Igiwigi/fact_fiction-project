Details of the optimal simulation for all capsule
sizes and both pulse sequences are given in table 1. The increase in gain between the optimal
3-pulse and 4-pulse sequence for each capsule size ranged between 42% and 360%. The variance
in this increase is likely due to the fact that the relationship between input energy and gain varies
with adiabat. Ignition will occur at lower energies for lower adiabats, and so energies near the
ignition threshold will see a larger increase in gain between the two pulse sequences (such as that
observed at 4.2 MJ). It is clear from table 1 that high gain can be achieved in this regime over a range of energy
scales, despite the stringent restrictions discussed in ยง2.
