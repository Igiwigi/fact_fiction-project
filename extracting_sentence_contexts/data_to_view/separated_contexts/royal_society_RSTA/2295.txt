Here, the
blue solid lines represent exact dispersion curves, yellow and green dashed lines corresponding
to the shear wave speeds of the substrate c = c}_ and the coating c = cy, respectively. Predictably, it is observed from figure 6 that as the contrast becomes less noticeable (y is
getting closer to unity), the angle between the dashed lines depicting shear wavefronts of the
layer and the half-space becomes narrower, with the solution of the dispersion relation (A 6) lying
within this angle. This confirms a well-known fact that the Love waves exist provided that the
shear wave speed of the half-space exceeds that of the layer, i.e. cy <c} or Â« < p, with the same
phenomena noted in the associated plane problem, see (3.2). Similar to Rayleigh waves, in case of
a homogeneous half-space (4 = 1), dispersion relation (A 6) does not allow a localized solution. The initial points of the dispersion modes (the cut-off frequencies) are located on the line c = c},
or 2+ =K (denoted with red dots) (figure 6).
