It seemed, therefore, essential to the present purpose to

determine by an X-ray method the direction of the cellulose chains in a single wood

cell and to relate this with the extinction positions of the wall. This is rendered

somewhat simpler by the fact that some tracheids on maceration are found to show

certain cracks, parallel to the major extinction position which previous workers have
assumed parallel to the cellulose chains, forming a single spiral round the cell. If
we can show that the cellulose chains are, in fact, parallel to the cracks, any doubt
as to the existence of a single spiral in these walls would be dispelled. The X-ray
photography of such minute cells presents a difficult problem ; their scattering
power is far too small to give a diagram in the ordinary spectrometer. Under the
direction of Mr. Asrsury, and with his help and that of other workers in his
laboratory to whom the author is greatly indebted, a camera has now been con-
structed to overcome this and other difficulties.
