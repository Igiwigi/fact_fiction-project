O. Browx, in connexion with gun-cotton. The
fact that the violent explosion of this snbstance cannot be developed except when it is
confined in receptacles of some strength has been up to the present time accepted as
indisputable. It occurred, however, to Mr. Brow that as gun-cotton is analogous in its
nature and operation as an explosive agent to nitroglycerine, differing principally from
that substance in the rapidity and consequent violence of its explosion, it might also,
like nitroglycerine, be susceptible of violent explosion when unconfined, by being ignited
through the agency of detonation.
