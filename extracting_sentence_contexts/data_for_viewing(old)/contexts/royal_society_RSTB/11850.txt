stress that have governed these events are varied, mostly
grouped into two main osmotic strategies, osmoconformism
and osmoregulation [15,59,60]. They also include the diverse
peculiarities of each lineage, for instance, mechanisms to limit
the entry of ions into the body, to control loss of water to the
external medium by osmosis or active excretion of ions and
water retention via specialized organs and tissues [61-64].
Interestingly, there is strong parallelism among these
lineages, because ability to hyperregulate (i.e. the ability to
maintain the haemolymph osmotic concentration under
freshwater conditions), is apparently conserved in all the
different lineages of saline insects as a plesiomorphy. More
striking is the fact that this conserved capacity remains
underexploited because these species are almost absent in
freshwater communities. This contrasts with the ‘use it or
lose it’ hypothesis ruled by negative selection or genetic
drift on unused traits that for example seem to have driven

the loss of eyes in deep soil or cave fauna [65,66]. There are
different potential non-exclusive hypotheses for conservation
of the hyperregulation capacity in saline lineages: (i) positive
selection during the process of dispersal to new habitat
patches. Several studies have proposed a relatively low colo-
nization potential for some saline insect lineages, owing to a
combination of poor dispersal capacity and the very patchy
