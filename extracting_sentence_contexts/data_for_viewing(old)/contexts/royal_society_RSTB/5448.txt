pedicle to chondrify, the conditions as present in Sorex would be reproduced. The
only other case known to me in which the pterygoid cartilage comes into relation with
other structures forming part of the neurocranium is an obscure one described by
Fiscuer (1901), in Talpa. On p. 515 he says :—** Erst spiter, wenn schon die Ver-
knécherung beginnt, verwachsen auch die Pterygoidknorpel mit der Schiidelbasis,”
and the place of fusion is the “ Unterseite der Orbitalfliigelbasis.” On the other hand,
NoorpENsos (1905), working also on ‘lalpa, says on p. 405 :—‘‘ Nur habe ich sicher
stellen kénnen, dass der knorpelige Proc. pterygoideus beim Maulwurf nicht synchon-
drotisch mit der knorpeligen Schiidelbasis sich verbindet, wie es ausdriicklich auch
von Fiscuer betont worden ist.” It would seem, therefore, that in Talpa the
connexion is bony, and it differs from my cases, not only in the place of attachment of
the pterygoid cartilages, but also in the fact that the attachment in this case occurs
late (‘‘ when ossification sets in”), whereas in my cases, the rudiments of the pterygoid
cartilage and ala temporalis are already connected in procartilage.

The interpretation of the conditions in Sorex depends largely on the meaning attached
to the pterygoid cartilage. Fucus (1909) regards this cartilage as primitive, and as
representing a remnant of the original palato-pterygoid cartilage of lower forms. Since
the ala temporalis is certainly a visceral cartilage, and partly homologous with the
processus ascendens of the pterygo-quadrate of lower forms, I do not doubt that Fucus
would see a support for his theory in the conditions in Sorex. However, the pterygoid
cartilage is of a peculiar nature. The histological picture which it presents is quite
different from that of undoubted primitive cartilage (such as that of the ala temporalis,
for example), but is identical with that of the nodules of cartilage which are to be found
