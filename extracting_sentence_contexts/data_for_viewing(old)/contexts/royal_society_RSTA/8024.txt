pattern formed by a system of protein chains is in general much larger than what at
first sight appears. The relatively small unit of pattern of which the more obvious
features of the X-ray photograph are an expression should strictly be described as a
pseudo-pattern, a pattern within a pattern. For instance, the molecular pattern along
the fibre axis in «-keratin repeats most clearly at a distance of about 5-1 A; but there
is no doubt that the true pattern is defined by a multiple, and probably a considerable
multiple, of this, just as the prominent period (about 3-4 A) of $-keratin is really only
the average length per residue of the amino-acid residues from which the stretched
pattern is constructed.

The spacing of the strong arc on the meridian of the «photograph was originally
given as 5-15 A; but we have now been able to show that this is a maximum value
arising out of the fact that it is almost impossible to build up a bundle of straight, parallel
hairs without stretching them slightly. The true “unstretched” spacing is about
5-06 A, as determined from small pieces of porcupine quill, which were, of course,
rigid enough to be self-supporting when held at one end only, and which had been
previously soaked in water to ensure that all strains had been eliminated. On
stretching the quill in the stretching-frame already described, I, the spacing was found
to increase continuously and reversibly from 5-06 A up to a maximum of 5-15 A;
that is, over a range of some 2%, corresponding to the Hooxn’s law region of the load/
extension curve. No further spacing change is recorded until the onset of the intra-
molecular transformation, when there is a discontinuous change from 5-15 A to about
3:4 A (see below).

In view of the difficulty of recording with any degree of certainty small spacing-
