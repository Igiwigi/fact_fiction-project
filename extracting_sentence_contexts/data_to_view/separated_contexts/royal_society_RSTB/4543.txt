Immediately behind the thirteenth setigerous segment there has been
formed what is evidently the commencement of a new stolon head, with a fairly long
median tentacle and two lateral buds, the latter evidently representing the commence-
ment of lateral tentacles. Behind this there are indications of two further pairs of
lateral buds before the original tissue is reached. It is a fact of great interest that a portion of a stolon should in this way
regenerate the whole of a new souche and a new stolon head. Returning now to the records of regenerated specimens contained in Table IT, it
will be seen that they lend considerable support to the view which has been put
forward already, that when regeneration takes place from any particular section of
segments it proceeds until the section comes to occupy in the new worm the same
position which it occupied in the old one. The records need to be treated with some caution, and are not well adapted for
statistical study, since there was certainly some selection in picking out the
particular specimens which were examined, in favour, on the one hand, of those which
showed obvious signs of regeneration and in which therefore regeneration was still in
a moderately early stage, and, on the other hand, of those large specimens in which
regeneration was nearly complete, which were specially searched for.
