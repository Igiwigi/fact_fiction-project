with unit mass (mp =1, A = 0) and f = 0.05, (b) with HF amplitude g for three values of LF w (w = 0.1, w = 0.25 and
@ = 0.5) fora system with unit mass (my = 1, A = 0) and f = 0.01, and (c) with g for five values of mass amplitudes my =
(1, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.5) andf = 0.05 fora system with constant mass (A = 0). Other parameters are set as: $2 = 9.842, = 0.5,
a=02,8 =1, wo = —1. The thick lines represent analytically computed response amplitudes from equation (3.19) while
thin lines, broken lines and markers of the same colour represent the numerically computed response amplitude from the main
equation of the PDM-Duffing oscillator (equation (2.9)) using equation (4.5).

mx) =mg and 4 =0, corresponding to a Duffing oscillator with constant mass. Remarkably, for
a particle with constant unitary mass (mj =1,4 =0), the PDM-Duffing oscillator (equation (2.9)
is reduced to the bistable oscillator considered in the pioneering work on VR by Landa &
McClintock [23]. As expected for this special case, VR is observed as shown in figure 4. In fact,
the results of the preliminary analysis for a PDM-Duffing system with constant unitary mass as
presented in figure 4a are consistent with both the theoretical and numerical results presented by
Blekhmann & Landa (see fig. 2b of [106]). Further evidence of VR in this special case is presented
for the dependence of the response amplitude Q on the HF amplitude g for three values of the LF
w(= 0.1, 0.25, 0.1), as shown in figure 4b for f = 0.01.

Next, we consider the effect of the PDM parameters on the observed resonances and thus
focus on the possible impact of the mass parameters mo and 4. First, we consider the effect of
the mass amplitude mg on known resonances for the preliminary case 14 =0, as presented in
figure 4c for the variation of the response amplitude Q with HF amplitude g for the constant
unitary mass imp = 1 and three larger and smaller values (imo = 0.5, mg = 1.3, mp = 1.5) for f = 0.05
and other parameters unchanged. In figure 4c, for mp =1 and w=0.5, the resonance curve
