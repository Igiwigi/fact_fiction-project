When, lastly, the cartilaginous arches themselves
are ossified, macerated vertebree look strikingly like the biconcave vertebree of many
Teleostean fishes,


VERTEBRAL COLUMN OF AMPHIBIA AND AMNIOTA. 7

The invertebral ring of actively growing cartilage hinders the chorda in its further
growth, reducing it to a thread (occasionally called funiculus chord), or even
destroying it completely. In many Urodela, especially in the Perennibranchiata, the whole intervertebral
cartilage acts as the joint, being, in fact, a flexible mass intercalated between the
bases of the hollow calcified cones of the successive vertebrie. However imperfect
this joint may be, it does fultil the requirements of these long-bodied and long-tailed
aquatic Urodela. Even in the more terrestrial Urodeles the formation of the intervertebral joint does
not always lead to a complete severance of the cartilage, but, as GuGENBAUR has
already fully described, only a differentiation of its cells takes place, while the inter-
cellular substance remains continuous.
