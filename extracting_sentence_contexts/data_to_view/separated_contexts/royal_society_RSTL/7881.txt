12 is found at the
station c &, and amounts to 13,800 foot-tons, or about one-eighth more than it is at the
corresponding station in fig. 11, this increase being due to the transposition of weights
to the extremities. It may be well here to revert briefly to the fact that no ship having an excess of weight
over buoyancy at the extremities (as all, or nearly all, ships have) can sag throughout
her length when afloat in still water, although she may hog and not 82g. The cases of
the © Minotaur,” © Bellerophon,” and © Audacious” prove the possibility of the latter con-
dition, and no more need be said respecting it. That sagging alone cannot take place
