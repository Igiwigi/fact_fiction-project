alkaline solution of albumen ; that a low positive power sepa-
rates albumen with acid, and the salts of the blood. That with
one degree of power, albumen is separated in a, solid form,
with a less degree, it is separated in a fluid form. From these facts, the following queries are: proposed. _ 18t. That such, decomposition of the blood by electricity,
may be as near an approach to secretion, as could be expected
to be produced by the artificial means at present- in our
power,

2d. That a weaker power of electricity, than any that can
be readily kept up by art, may be capable of separating from


of animal Secretions.
