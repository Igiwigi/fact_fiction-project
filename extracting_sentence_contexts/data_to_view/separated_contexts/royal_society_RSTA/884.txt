(b) Graph states

A graph state |G) isa quantum state described by a simple unweighted undirected graph G, where
the vertices of G correspond to the qubits of |G). Formally, let G = (V, E) be a graph, the graph state

|G) is then defined as
=[[& BH», (2.6)

ecE veV

where ch ) is a controlled phase gate between qubits u and v, ie.

(V\u)

CH”) = 10) ln @ 1) + |1) Ay @ ZN. (2.7)

A graph state is also a stabilizer state [18]. The generators of the stabilizer group of |G) can be
written as

gv =Xv [] Zu. (2.8)

In fact, any stabilizer state can be made into some graph state by only performing single-qubit
Clifford operations [9]. If two states, |y) and |#) are related by some sequence of single-qubit
Clifford operations, we denote this by |) ~Lc |¢). Given a stabilizer state |S), one can find a graph
state |G) such that |S) y ~ic |G)y, by simply performing Gaussian elimination followed by certain
operations on the columns of a matrix which rows are the symplectic form of the generators
of S [18].
