Boracic acid decomposes it, in a very different way, not from
any predominant affinity for the water, but in consequence of
a stronger attraction for the fluoric acid itself. Silicated fluoric
acid of course is not produced ; but liquid fluoboracic acid and
the silex is precipitated in a gelatinous state, as when ammonia
is employed. Thezse are the principal facts I have to notice respecting this
acid. Before I conclude, I shall briefly mention a few other
circumstances. Applied to the tongue, in its concentrated state,
it produces a very painful sensation, like that which strong
muriatic acid does, and it has a very similar effect on the
cuticle.
