near sea-level at the extreme north of the Scottish coast (Marshall, 1gor).

T. alpinum has been recorded from the Barnwell Beds, Cambridge (Chandler 1921), and
from the late-Glacial deposits in the Lea Valley (Reid 1915). In Ireland it has been re-

ported from zone II of the late-Glacial at Ballybetagh (Jessen & Farrington 1938) and from
zone III at Drumurcher (Mitchell 19424). In Scotland it has been found in late-Glacial
clay at Whitrig Bog, Berwickshire (Mitchell 1948).

Attention is drawn to the fact that pollen of the genus Thalictrum was found throughout
the lower organic layers at site 36, 0 to 31 cm., and through both the lower organic layers
and the overlying gravelly-soil at site 42 A, 98 to 10 cm.

Veronica anagallis-aquatica L.

Small seeds of Veronica were abundant in the upper muds and detritus layers of site 42B
(figure 9g). Besides their characteristic shape the size range (up to 0-6 mm. in length)
limits the identification to V. anagallis-aquatica L., V. aquatica Bernh. and V. beccabunga L.
Of these, the last has a seed a little longer than the average specimens from Hawks Tor and
a little less near in shape than have the other two species. Whether one can distinguish
V. anagallis-aquatica from V. aquatica on seed characters alone is doubtful, so that either of
these two species may be represented at Hawks Tor.
