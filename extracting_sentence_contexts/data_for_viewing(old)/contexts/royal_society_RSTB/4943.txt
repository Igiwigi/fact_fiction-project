The difference of pressure on opposite sides of C was chosen as the measure of the
flow. The manometer tubes (‘I) opened respectively above and below the canvas, and
the latter (a new piece, chosen for uniformity) was well stretched on its frame. To
interpret the manometer readings the bottom half of a large cardboard pill-box was
pressed against the under-side of the canvas, and air drawn from it at a known rate by
a tube connecting it with an aspirator. The pressure difference between opposite sides
of the patch of canvas covered by the pill-box was measured by the manometer, and
the process repeated at a number of evenly spaced positions on the canvas to average
out irregularities.

The results obtained with a 160-egg Gloucester are given in Table XX. The felts
referred to are those supplied by the makers to put between the eggs and C in the earlier
stages of incubation. The fact that they produce so little effect on the flow shows
