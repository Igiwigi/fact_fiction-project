Just above the red bed similar in form to that through which, below, the spring

Sf the district than has yet been given to it. There are veins of a white waxy
ARUuminium silicate traversing the brown or yellowish brown clays, which probably
fill fissures produced by the drying of the original mass, which in some cases, as in
that of certain specimens of the red baked upper layer, seems to have as8umed a
quasi-columnar structure.
