The consolidation idea has been refined in several ways.
First, the concept of ‘transfer’ of information from hippo-
campus to cortex is no longer accepted. Instead, parallel
encoding is now considered explicitly, with hippocampal-—
neocortical interactions serving to stabilize neocortical traces
selectively. Second, according to a multiple trace theory,
event memory can be subdivided into context-specific episo-
dic memory that is stored in hippocampus (‘what, where and
when’), and semantic memory for ‘facts’ stored in neocortex
[36]. Episodic memory is analogous to Marr’s recording of
events—the memory of things that happen during the day.
Semantic memory is the corpus of factual knowledge
acquired through formal training or from our interpretation
and recoding of events. Third, new work on frameworks of
semantic knowledge in both animals and humans suggests
that activated prior knowledge can guide or at least influence
the process of systems memory consolidation, and thereby
decrease the time it takes [37,38]. These challenge the
notion that the simple memory is the only fast component
of the system. Even in the complementary learning systems
framework, the gradual creation of categories in neocortex
occurs using plasticity mechanisms that are just as fast in
the neocortex as in the hippocampus [34].
