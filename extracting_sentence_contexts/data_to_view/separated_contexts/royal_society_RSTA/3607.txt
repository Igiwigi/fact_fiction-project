correlation line (Fe/Mn~ 44), which manifests as a slight vertical smearing of the correlation
[262,263]. That is, zoning tends to vertically smear the Fe/Mn correlation. The fact that zoning causes slight modifications in the Fe/Mn ratio means that zoning does
not move chondrule olivine out of regimes corresponding to that chondrite class. Hence, the
discrimination between different carbonaceous chondrite classes in the Fe-Mn plot are due
to significant differences in precursor composition or oxygen fugacity, meaning that there are
distinguishable reservoirs and physical conditions that pertain to distinct chondrite classes [262,
263]. The addition of MnO (by condensation) during crystallization is the favoured explanation
for zoning in CR type II chondrules (§5e).

(e) CR chondrule olivine

Next, we embark on explaining the wide range of the Fe—-Mn relation that is occupied by type II
olivine grains in CR chondrites because CR and Stardust both occupy broad regions in the Fe-Mn
plot.
