There is also an apparent reduction in wind speed at Icelandic AWSs during the eclipse, as
seen with the UK data, but this is superimposed on a trend of decreasing wind speed during
the 6h period centred on the eclipse. The wind reduction is large and obvious for stations where
the decline in temperature exceeds 1.5°C and much less apparent for stations with more modest
temperature decreases (figure 11): for example, for the 15 Icelandic stations where temperature
declined by more than or equal to 2°C (less than 1°C) during the eclipse, mean wind speed fell
from 4.96 (5.70) ms~! at 0800 to 2.03 (5.35)ms~! at 0910. Therefore, this drop in wind speed is
probably related to the eclipse.

Finally, electronic supplementary material, figure S11, shows the MSLP at IMO AWS for 0930
UTC (around the time of mid-eclipse) and the MSLP changes during the first and second halves of
the eclipse (0840-0940 and 0940-1040). Electronic supplementary material, figure S11a, does not
show a cyclonic-type circulation pattern anywhere over Iceland—in fact, it shows an anticyclonic
anomaly of approximately +1 hPa in central southern Iceland—and electronic supplementary
material, figure S11b, does not show any systematic decrease in MSLP during the first half of the
eclipse that might be related to a possible eclipse cyclone—indeed MSLP changes were generally
more positive during the first half of the eclipse (mean change 0.33 hPa) compared with the second
hour (mean change 0.06 hPa): this bias is especially evident in inland southern Iceland (electronic
supplementary material, figure S11).
