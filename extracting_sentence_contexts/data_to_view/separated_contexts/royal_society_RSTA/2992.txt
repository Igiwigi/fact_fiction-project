In 1893, sunspots were at their
maximum, and the regular diurnal range was very large. A comparatively trifling
disturbance might suffice to bring the range over 20’, which Mr. Exuis treats, at
least roughly, as a minimum value for a disturbance ; thus, when main importance
was assigned to the amplitude of the range, it was only natural to reach a larger
number for the disturbed days in 1893 than when attention was directed to the
greater or less abnormality of the curve. As compared to the two adjacent years,
1893 was, in fact, remarkable for the extraordinary absence of irregular movements. §6. Table IL gives the distribution of the disturbances and disturbed days
throughout the year, with corresponding data from Mr, Maunper’s list ; it also gives
some particulars as to the amplitudes of the movements.
