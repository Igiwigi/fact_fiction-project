In addition to this anastomotic branch, the lateral cutaneous artery gives off in the
region of the shoulder several small branches to the neighbouring muscles. As it passes
backwards the branches that spring from its deeper surface increase very much in number,
and from a point about 3 cm. behind the scapula to the level of the pelvic fins, assume
a very peculiar character. Within this area the deep branches form a close-set series
of short trunks, not more than 1 mm. in length, each terminating in a brush of fine
parallel twigs that run directly inwards between the bundles of the trunk muscles
towards the vertebral column.

The components of the arterial brushes are unbranched except towards their final
distribution, and lie close side by side, interspersed with corresponding bundles of fine
parallel veins, the whole forming a simple rete, differing from those of MiLLERâ€™s unipolar
type only in the fact that the individual twigs do not anastomose to form a true plexus.

The vessels that form the arterial component of this rete are of approximately the
same size (Plate 9, fig. 5), and retain their diameter for a very considerable distance
towards the vertebral column.

In structure (Plate 10, fig. 6) they resemble other arteries of small size, but show an
unusually strong and complete elastica interna. The media is weak and consists of pure
smooth muscle of, at the most, two cells thick ; it is surrounded by a fairly deep layer
of white fibrous tissue (adventitia) which is remarkable for the complete absence of
elastic fibres.

The venous spaces are bounded by the adventitia of the arteries, lined apparently
