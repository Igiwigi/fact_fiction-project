I am sympathetic with what motivates the IBH, and of
course I agree that the classical computer metaphor is
inadequate. Indeed, modern cognitive neuroscience acknow]l-
edges that much of cognition is ‘active’: we continuously
move our eyes to redirect visual input [7], we continuously
shift attention to redirect what information is processed, we
continuously interact with the environment, especially in
the case of a social encounter [8,9]. Current enthusiasm
about Bayesian or predictive coding approaches [10,11]
reflects this acknowledgement. But I am confused about
how and why one would need to adopt the IBH, as opposed
to one of its weaker forms, to incorporate these facts. To make
my confusion more transparent, consider three properties of a
person that we might want to understand: their observable
behaviour, their cognition and their conscious experience.
Let’s consider these in the light of an experiment that IBH
advocates have mustered: the experiment by Auvray ef al.
[4], discussed above (cf. figure 1). In this study, participants
find each other’s sensors, even though they themselves
appear unaware of whether they are finding a sensor or a
shadow. One could quibble about various aspects of this
example as a good example of the IBH in action (it is not par-
ticularly ‘ecologically valid’; the fact that the subjects cannot
explicitly distinguish sensor from shadow does not show that
