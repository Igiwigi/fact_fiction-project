except en masse with the trunk, and ptosis of the right eye. None of these sxymptoms
were, however, at all discoverable on the third day, and from this time onwards the
animal exhibited no discoverable defect, either as regards the movements of its head
and eyes, or otherwise. It is to be noted in this case that a considerable portion of
the base of the superior frontal convolutions still remained uninjured, though the
prefrontal regions were almost entirely destroyed.

Apart from a degree of dulness or apathy—and this as time went on not
particularly observable—there was nothing in the animal's behaviour at all remark-

© But the important anatomical fact described in connexion with Experiment, 22 was
ere also noted, viz. : descending degeneration of the mesial bundles of the internal

Sapsule and crus cerebri, as far as the pyramidal tracts of the pons.

E These degenerated fibres were, in the internal capsule, of clearly different dates.

The older, which were sclerosed and deeply tained, might reasonably be regarded
