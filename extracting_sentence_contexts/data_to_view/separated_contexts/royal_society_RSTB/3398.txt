Marre* finds that the centripetal wood in the
ovuliferous scales of Cycads passes over into transfusion tissue which may spread in
a ring round the bundles. In a similar way the lignified elements internal to the
protoxylem and external to the phloem in the bundles of the Welwitschian
peduncles have been seen to pass over at a higher level into complete bundles and
at a lower level into transfusion tissue. It is questionable, however, if it can be
argued from this series of facts that the transfusion tissue in the leaf and bract is
homologous with centripetal xylem. Sxction V.â€”ReELationsHies oF Welwitschia. A.
