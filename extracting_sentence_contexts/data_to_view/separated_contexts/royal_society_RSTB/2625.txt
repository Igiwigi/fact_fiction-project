Tt will readily oceur to the reader that it would have been a better plan to have
selected a certain number of blastule or very young echinoplutei, and have trans-
ferred them at once to the larger culture jars. As a matter of fact this plan was
tried, but it resulted in failure, as nearly all the larvee died. The explanation of this
curious fact which suggests itself to me is, that the hardiest larvee can only be
selected by subjecting them to a fairly severe struggle for existence during the first
weeks of their existence. The survivors of this struggle are then exceptionally
vigorous individuals, and capable of undergoing their further development without
further trouble. This idea is confirmed by the observation that some of the hardiest
larve were obtained from a culture in which, owing to the overcrowding of the eggs
in the dish in which fertilisation was effected, only about one-tenth of the number
developed.
