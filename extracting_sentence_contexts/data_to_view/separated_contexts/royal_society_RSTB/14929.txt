Global changes in transcript isoform signatures
are described both in stem cell lineage progression and cancer [8,9]. In addition,
splicing is deregulated in tumor cells [10] and alternative promoter usage is pre-
dictive of cancer patient survival [11] reflecting the broad functional impact of

Figure 1. Identification and characterization of Padi2 isoform expression. (a) Schematic illustration of Padi2a and Padi2£ transcripts identified by RNA sequencing
and PCR walking, highlighting exons (boxes) and introns (lines). Padi2G transcription is initiated downstream within an intronic region, generating a significantly
truncated mRNA and protein. (b) Sequencing and epigenetic profiling of Padi2 chromatin in primary oligodendrocytes [26] uncovers an accessible intronic promoter
tegion (bound by CTCF and enriched for H3K27ac and H3K4me3) upstream of exon 7 in the Padi2 gene, corresponding to the Padi2G transcription start site (TSS).
(q Simplified diagram of the PADI2 protein structures to illustrate the lack of the PAD_N and parts of PAD_M domains in PADI2§ (right), with three-dimensional
models underneath.
