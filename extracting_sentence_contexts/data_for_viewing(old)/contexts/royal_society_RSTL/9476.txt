Whether the fact that the thicker plate of meerschaum gave nearly three times the
difference of either of the previous plates was due to the thicker plate maintaining a
greater difference of temperature, or to some difference of texture in the thin plate,
such as a flaw, has not been clearly determined, but it now appears probable that it
was largely due to the first of these causes.

With this plate lower pressures were for the first time tried, and Table III. shows
these differences falling with the pressure.

The ratio of the difference of pressure to the mean pressure, however, as is shown in
the last column, increases as the pressure falls, and apparently is approximating to a
constant value at lower pressures. This is according to Law IIT., Art. 9.
