my however, the weight of the conclusions that may be drawn from these computations
= Aopends greatly on the internal evidence supplied by their greater or Jess consistency
© among themselves, it is important to dwell somewhat more on this point.
2 The requisite test will best be supplied by the values of » which indicate the times
= of maximum phase, and are, therefore, immediately dependent on the Sun’s action,
2 and should follow his position ; and this being subject to regular periodical change in
5 the course of the year, it would follow that if the values of » show corresponding
3 regular, or nearly regular, periodical variations, they may be regarded as affording
S yalid internal evidence of being trustworthy. The values of P, the total amplitude
iS or variation of temperature, which are certainly subject to influences of a much more
&. local and irregular character, will be liable to much greater and more irregular
5 changes.
5 A convenient and succinct summary of the facts bearing on this point will be found
3 ‘in the following Table, which shows for the series of 20 years the number of times
@ (reckoned as a percentage) in which the computed values of » for single months fall
E ‘in the several quadrants, the hours corresponding to which are as follows :—
