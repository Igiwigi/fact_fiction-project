RAN tasks require a child to name as
quickly as they can a list of pictures, colours, letters or num-
bers. Children with dyslexia perform poorly on RAN [26],
and in unselected samples of children, there are reliable con-
current and longitudinal correlations between RAN and
childrenâ€™s reading skills (see [27,28], for reviews). The fact
that even RAN for pictures and colours, measured before
children can read, is predictive of later variations in reading
skills [21] indicates that this effect cannot just be a conse-
quence of differences in LK. The fact that RAN predicts
reading accuracy as well as fluency suggest that this effect
does not simply reflect general variations in speed of proces-
sing. Furthermore, whatever RAN taps, it is statistically
independent of LK and PA as a predictor of decoding skill.
