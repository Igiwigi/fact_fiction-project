through O', then the polar conic of O' passes
through O; but this conic intersects the line L
in two points, and the line joining O' to each of
them is a tangent to Aj, Hence from any point

of the line CN can in general two tangents be

drawn to A; and we shall scee immediately that ON itself is a tangent. This agrees
with the fact of the curve being of the third class. Let the polar conic of C intersect
CL in the points Q, Q', then the lines CQ, CQ! are tangents to A; ; in other words, CL is
a double tangent, and it is plain that Q, Q' are its points of contact. Again, let the
polar line of C intersect ON in H, then HW is a point of contact, 80 that ON is a tangent.
