of tin in the alloy, the bars are far too abundant for such a hypothesis. It seems
more probable that when the temperature of the transformation curve was reached
at 600°, the solid alloy began to separate into two, or, through imperfect equilibrium,
into several phases with different percentages of tin, all the more tin-rich phases
re-crystallising in a form isomorphous with 7, and therefore all to be classified as 7.
An analogy for this may, perhaps, be found in the breaking-up of a liquid into
conjugates during rapid cooling. In such a case a whole series of liquid phases must
through imperfect transformation exist together, and if a process analogous to
chilling could be effected they would be stereotyped as we see them here. In the
whitest parts, which in the FeCl, etch are the most copper-rich, the 8 crystallisation
has taken place. The bars, which are really sections of plates, have definite
crystalline shape, and present many good examples of twinning. As Mr. FraRnstpEs
has pointed out to us, it resembles the twinning seen in soda felspars, but the fact
that the bars darken at different rates when heat-oxidised, is some indication that
they are not merely twins in a homogeneous substance.

same is true of all lower chills ; for example, those at 556° and 380°, that is to say, of
all ingots chilled below the D’ temperature. But these ingots contain a new feature
in the form of lace bars. The bars do not present the same variety of shade, and
