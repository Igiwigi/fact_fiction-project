is seen a stage s0mewhat more advanced. The central vesicles had essentially the
same appearance as the foregoing, but were generally larger (the largest in the figure
was about 4"), and their envelopes of vesicles seemed more perfectly formed, and were

free from the dark granules or globules of the preceding stage. One of the central
vesicles in this figure presented an indistinct spot. The object in fig. 81. is from the
ovary of the common fowl. Its central part resembled the objects in figs. 83 and 84.

243. I have copied from Canvs+ the drawing of a structure (Plate VIII. fig. 131.)
occurring in the ovum of one of the Mollusca,—Unio tumida. With this I would com-
pare fig. 130. The latter represents a structure of the same kind as that which in
Mammalia closely invests the embryo, and seems to enter into the formation of the
amnion; the former exhibits an object which, in the molluscons animal above-men-
tioned, appeared to Carvs to be the foundation of the shel{. The Professor 8aw a
similar structure in ova of Anodonta, The © rhombick fields” in the figure from
Carvs, as that author terms them, (which appear to me to have been vesicles with
nuclei) seemed to become more numerous as development proceeded. With this ob-
servation I would compare what has been stated (par. 174 to 178. 180. 314 to 318.)
