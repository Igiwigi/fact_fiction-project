In addition, however, a spatial cascade is required which transfers momentum via ideal
nonlinear interactions through an ‘inertial sublayer’ in order to maintain the necessary supply
from the flow interior, in close analogy with the cascade of kinetic energy through the ‘inertial
subrange’ in fluid turbulence away from walls [17]. The aim of the present short paper is to
discuss this momentum cascade in wall-bounded turbulence using the same methods which
have been previously applied to analyse anomalous dissipation of kinetic energy in such wall-
bounded flows [1-4]. To be concrete, we shall consider the specific example of pressure-driven
flows through pipes and channels. In this brief summary, we shall focus mainly on the essential
ideas and on the physical motivation of the mathematical approach, with full details and rigorous
analysis provided in a longer paper [18]. The conclusion of the analysis is that certain specific
types of discontinuity of the velocity at the wall are required for a strict momentum anomaly, in
agreement with the early insight of Taylor [15] and with similar conclusions for kinetic energy
anomaly [1-4]. In fact, we shall see that even a ‘weak anomaly’ in momentum conservation
requires a less than smooth approach of the streamwise velocity to zero as the distance to the
wall is decreased through the inertial sublayer, in analogy also to energy dissipation [19,20]. We
obtain in this manner a version of Prandtl’s relation between the Blasius drag law f(Re) ~ Re~!/4
and a (1/7)th power-law approach of the streamwise velocity to zero ([21,22], and see also [23], pp.
599-600), but now rigorously valid for individual flow realizations without ensemble averaging.
At asymptotically large Reynolds numbers, we can similarly show that the von Karman—Prandtl
drag law requires a logarithmically slow approach of the streamwise velocity to zero at the
wall [18].

The theoretical analysis of Onsager [5-7] is best understood physically as an application
of the ‘principle of renormalization group invariance’ [24], as we have previously explained
for turbulence away from walls [25]. This same interpretation holds also for wall-bounded
