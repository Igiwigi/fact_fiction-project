Tf the south of England
taken as the pole of a hemisphere, i will be found that almost the whole of the land,
excepting Australia, lies in that hemisphere, whilst the antipodal hemisphere consj
almost entirely of sea. This proves that the centre of gravity of the earth's mags is
more remote from England, than the centre of figure of the solid globe. ,

A deformation of this kind is expressed by a surface harmonie of the first order, for
such an harmonic is equivalent to a small displacement of the sphere as a whole, with-
out true deformation. Now if we consider the surface forces produced by 8wch a
deformation in a homogeneous sphere, we find of course that there is an unbalanced
resultant force acting on the whole sphere in the direction diametrically opposed to
that of the equivalent displacement of the whole sphere. |

The fact that in the homogeneous sphere such an unbalanced force exists shows that
in this case the problem is meaningless ; it is in fact merely equivalent to a mischoice
in the origin for the coordinates. But in the case of the earth snch an inequality does
exist, and the force referred to must of course be counterbalanced gomehow. The
balance can only be maintained by inequalities of density, which are necessarily
unknown.
