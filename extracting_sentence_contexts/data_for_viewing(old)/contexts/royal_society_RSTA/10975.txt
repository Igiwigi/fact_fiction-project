applicable to two-dimensional problems only. In so far as this is the case, its scope
may appear restricted. But when we consider the fact that in the practical applica-
tions of magnetism, the bulk of the phenomena with which we have to deal are of
the two-dimensional order, it will be recognised that it offers a solution of problems
whose interest and importance are by no means inconsiderable. The magnetic field
in and around the armature of a dynamo or alternator, and that in and around
a cylindrical case which is used for purposes of magnetic shielding, are examples
of important practical problems in two dimensions.


ON LINES OF INDUCTION IN A MAGNETIC FIRLD. 305

One very important feature which characterises the method, is the fact that it
enables us to obtain the exact shape of the lines of induction not only in air, but
in the para-magnetic or dia-magnetic material itself. This cannot be accomplished
by any of the older methods. The method has therefore been applied to determine
the exact form of the lines of induction for a number of cases of mathematical
interest, several of which have been also plotted by calculation. Inasmuch as the
laws connecting the relative thicknesses of two liquid films with the corresponding
values of the permeability, have by the above investigation been determined, it is
possible to investigate any practical case which may be of interest, and some
examples are given of the application of the method in cases of interest to
electricians.
