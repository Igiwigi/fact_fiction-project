g The Relation of the Attack of the Eosinophile Cell to the Ingestive Act of the Hyaline

Bell.—A study of the way in which some of the carnivorous Protozoa capture and
Bigest their prey, throws a clear light on the relations of the peculiar mode in which
She cosinophile cell attacks a bacillus to the simple ingestive act of a hyaline cell,
2 Amaba. Further, if all these facts are placed together, they suggest many thoughts
@n the relation of intra-cellular to extva-cellular digestion.

By comparing the various accounts given by Lemy, M. GRrEENwoop, and other
observers, of the manner in which an animal like Ameba or Actinospherium captures
and ingests its prey, we find that the following processes may be recognized :—(1) Con-
tact is effected with the prey and its movements are arrested ; (2) then, after it has
thus been maimed or killed, the prey is ingested and digested. But the captured
infusorian may resist the benumbing influence of the captor, and may, after being
exposed for a long time to the eatra-cellular attack, as it were, acquire tolerance of it,
