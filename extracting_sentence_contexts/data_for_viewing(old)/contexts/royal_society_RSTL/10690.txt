This determinant possesses properties similar to those proved for the other deter-
minant ; the sum of the squares of the terms in any row, or any column, is unity, and
the sum of the products of corresponding terms in any two rows, or in any two columns,
1s Zero,

26. From this scheme it follows that the coordinates of the edges of the fixed
tetrahedron referred to the other will be (Â«, &,, &g, a4, ;, ag), &. There are other
relations between the constituents of the determinant, due to the fact thab opposite
edges are conjugate polars with reference to the absolute quadric. Thus

If we square the determinant we get
DS=T:

As before we take D=1:; in fact, D is the determinant formed out of the second
minors of A, Whence
D=ALE
