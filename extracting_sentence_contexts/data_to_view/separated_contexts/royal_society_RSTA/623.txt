One example is to combine EIT and ECT together to realize
the three-phase gas/oil/water flow [61]. Nevertheless, for all cases, further studies on the data
fusion method are necessary in order to realize the multidimensional approach.

5. Reconstruction algorithms :S
The function of reconstruction algorithms is to convert the tomography sensor measurements into : a
a tomogram that represents the electrical property distributions. 1S
Owing to the fact that electrical tomography techniques generally have a low spatial resolution 7
compared with hard-field tomography techniques, there has been much research on new : Sg
reconstruction algorithm developments [62-65]. The common goal of these new algorithms is :B
to improve electrical tomography’s ill-posed nature, aiming to achieve a better spatial resolution 73
and image accuracy. Ideally, a good algorithm needs to have the following features: : x

— high accuracy;
— low computational complexity; and
— robustness.
