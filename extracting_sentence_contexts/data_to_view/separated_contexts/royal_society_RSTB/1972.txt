On removing the eye
from the lens the glare of the positive after-effect is at first so strong that every-
thing seems hidden behind a luminous fog, but after a few seconds this diminishes
until it is only noticeable on feebly illuminated objects. But for some time.all direct
sensation of the colour used for fatiguing the eye is completely lost, whereas its
sensitiveness to all other colours is undiminished. The observer is, in fact, colour-
blind. From this condition he recovers, in the case of the red light, in about ten
minutes, The effect of the green light lasts longer, and that of blue light longer
still, while the recovery from violet-blindness may require a couple of hours. Although for purposes of exact observation it is necessary to use a train of prisms,
the principal phenomena may so easily be demonstrated with coloured screens that it
may be worth while to describe briefly those I have found best adapted for the purpose.
