getting rid of the negative terms by expansion, that is

(ABD) + (ACD) + (BCD) + (AB) + (AC) + AD) -++ (BC) + (BD) + (CD)
= (4) = (8) = (C) —{D) + (0). But this is again simply the first condition of V.,§7. The whole of the conditions V.

for the congruence of fourth degree may in fact be derived by writing down the

conditions III. for each aggregate ABC, ABD, ACD, BCD, inserting the universes
a D or 5 in the first case, C or y in the second, and so on. Evidently this will give the
S right number of conditions, there being four aggregates and four conditions for each,
4 while each condition must hold good in two universes, total 4 x 4 x 2 = 32.
