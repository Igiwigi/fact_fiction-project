The above result shows that, when (E) is lost but the (WP) condition still holds, a non-zero
discontinuity vector gf becomes possible. It is apparent from (5.4) that the behaviour of the jump
Py and of the folding angle w(y) depend on the sign of the term f55. In particular, for f55 > 0,
the jump becomes exponentially decaying along the discontinuity line and y(y) > z as |y| > 00
(corresponding to the absence of folding). An analogous situation was encountered in the quasi-
static case [5]. However, for f55 < 0, the jump is propagating without any decay, which implies that
a folding wave propagates along the discontinuity line x = 0.

It is worth noting that the expression (5.4), describing the variation of PW, involves the
Cosserat modulus b3 (the secondary bending stiffness). However, this bending stiffness is not
involved in the infinite-body Green’s function, equation (4.27), which depends on the parameter
bo (with bp =b; — b3). In fact, although the relations for continuity of tractions (5.2) hold for
any value of the Cosserat modulus b3, it is apparent from (4.6)4 that, in order for (PD)® and
(E) to be lost simultaneously, the parameter b3 must be set to zero, b3 = 0, so that the emerging
discontinuity line becomes admissible (see also [5]).

Additional insight into the circumstances just described is provided by figure 7, where (a)
the real part of the normalized jump gf and (b) the real part of the dimensionless out-of-plane
displacement are depicted along the folding line x=0 for a Cosserat material at the (EI/P)
boundary for loss of (E) with 6 =0, y =1/4, « =1/4 and 4 =1. It is observed that, when the
microinertia is null (dashed curve) or when 6 < 6* (red curves in figure 7a), the jump, according to
equation (5.4), is a real-valued exponentially decaying function of y. On the other hand, for 6 > 6*
(blue curves in figure 7a), fw) propagates along the discontinuity line with a constant amplitude
which depends on the parameter @. In all cases, the out-of-plane displacement decreases away
