When the receiver was filled with ammoniacal gas, it was
turned round $0 as to bring the red liquid in contact with it.
A brilliant combustion took place, the red liquid assumed the
form of a dark brown solid, and glowed for some time with
an intense red heat. The residual matter being digested in
water left a quantity of green-coloured muriate of chromium,
or chloride of chromium, which would neither dissolve in
water, nor nitric acid; but I ascertained the presence of
muriatic acid by heating it with caustic potash. By this pro-
cess much sal ammoniac is formed, and a quantity of muriate
of chromium.

It is obvious from the preceding facts, that the property of
supporting combustion, which this liquid possesses to 80 great
a degree, is not owing solely to the chlorine which it contains,
but likewise to the oxygen of the chromic acid ; which, as

we $hall see afterwards, constitutes 80 considerable a portion
of it. So that chromic acid is a supporter of combustion, as

well as nitric acid, and nearly to as great an extent. Indeed
this might have been inferred from several facts already
