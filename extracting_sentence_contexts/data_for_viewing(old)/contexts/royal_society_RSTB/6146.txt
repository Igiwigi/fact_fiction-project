This difference between the two walls is emphasized here merely as an immediate
indication of some difference either in the method of production of the walls, or
during their differentiation. The sign of the difference is quite fortuitous, depending
on the various changes in length and breadth occurring during growth and
differentiation.

The second fact of importance from the point of view of the present theory is the
rapid steepening of the spiral on radial walls during the first few years. This is
exactly what we should expect from cells which are increasing in length at approxi-
mately constant breadth and forms the first, qualitative, indication that the present
theory may represent the truth. This steepening goes on for the first fifteen years,
after which the curve seems to rise again. It is not at present quite clear to what
this rise is due. Perhaps, since only in this one experiment has such a long series
of readings been taken, the result is quite accidental ; but we are concerned mainly
with the wood of the first few years, so that no explanation of such a rise is at present
put forward. It should be understood that this part of the curve lies completely
outside the scope of the present considerations, the complete curve being given
here mainly to show experimentally that a change in the fibrillar direction on radial
walls, which has been predicted in the theory already outlined, does actually
