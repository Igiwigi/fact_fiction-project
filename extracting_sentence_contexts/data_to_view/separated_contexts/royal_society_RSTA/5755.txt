There are several aspects of this work that we would like to pursue further. First, we would
like to see if the presence of the LV and CPTV KR axion background leaves detectable imprints
in the CMB spectrum. Second, given the fact that the coefficient of the H? term in the RVM-
like energy density during inflation is negative, due to the gravitational anomalies, it would be
interesting to see if one could somehow find evidence for it in the early Universe data. This is not
an easy task, given that the exit from inflation in our model involves a phase transition. Another
phenomenologically interesting avenue for research is the incorporation of the other axions that
arise after compactification in phenomenologically realistic string models, which lead to a rich
phenomenology [97,98].
