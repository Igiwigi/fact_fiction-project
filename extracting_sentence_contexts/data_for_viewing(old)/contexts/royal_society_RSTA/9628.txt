Moreover, considered as a whole, the results showed that “ spin” cannot be due
to any rotation of the gaseous medium itself but should be regarded as essentially
a localized “ head ” of intensive combustion travelling spiral-wise, as a wave-front,
through the otherwise stationary medium. Neither does there appear to be any
primary dependence of “ spin” upon such factors as the density or chemical com-
position of the medium, nor even upon the forward speed of flame-propagation in it,
although there was some evidence of its occurring only within certain flame-speed
limits, e.g., between 1200 and 2500 metres per second.

There were two features associated with the phenomenon which, although
invariably observed, were difficult to explain, namely (a) the strongly banded
appearance in the resulting photographs of the flame after detonation had been
set up, and (6) the fact that for a small fraction of a second after the initiation of
detonation—which was always associated with an ignition-ahead in the compression
wave immediately in advance of the actual flame-front—the actual forward flame-
speed was always substantially higher than that finally established after the
detonation had become normalized.*

It is to the further elucidation of such aspects of the phenomenon that our efforts
have been chiefly directed during the past three years. They have been powerfully
aided by the employment of a new revolving mirror type of high-speed photographic
camera, specially designed for the purpose by one of us (R.P.F.), of a much greater

* Throughout the paper this term will be used to denote a detonation which has had a sufficient
run for its forward flame-speed to have acquired its normal value, which in the moist 2CO + O,
