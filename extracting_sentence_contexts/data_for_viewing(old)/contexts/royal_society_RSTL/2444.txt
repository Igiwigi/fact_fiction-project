magnitude is different from what it would otherwise be. And the effects thus pro-
duced will depend upon the depth of the ocean, the form of its shores, and other
causes, of which it is impossible to estimate the result & prior:.

closely with the theory, and which in its amount appears to depend only on the ratio
of the forces of the sun and moon, we find that in fact its amount is different at dif-
ferent places, as we have already stated. We cannot expect, therefore, that the
amount of the corrections for parallax and declination will agree very exactly with
those from theory; and till the empirical corrections are more certainly and generally
determined, I have not thought it worth while to make the comparison.

But though there is at present this uncertainty respecting the amount of the in-
equalities of the tide, I do not conceive that there can be any doubt that the forms of
these corrections are such as I have stated them. In the case of the times of high
water especially, the general course of the variations of the quantities is as regular as
can be expected, and as is requisite for the establighment of our formulze. The
heights are much more anomalous ; probably they are more affected by winds, &.,
than the times are : and when we reflect that the tide at London may be affected by
