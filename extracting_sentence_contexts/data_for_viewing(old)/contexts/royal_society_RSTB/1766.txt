OF FOSSIL PLANTS FROM THE PALASOZOIC ROCKS. 101

sporangium is attached along the whole of its lower surface to the horizontal pedicel of
the sporophyll, and that it is partly roofed in above by a kind of indusium, arising
from the upturned lamina, as in Isoétes. In these points (to which Mr. Krpston
first called my attention) Sigillariostrobus ciliatus differs entirely from Spencerites,
and apparently from Sigillariostrobus Crepini also.

In the face of these facts it is impossible to unite Spencerites with Sigillariostrobus,
any more than with Lepidostrobus; our two species are best regarded as the repre-
sentatives of a distinct Lycopodiaceous genus.

This conclusion leaves us in doubt as to the true nature of M. Zeriier’s Sigil-
lariostrobus Crepini. As that author points out, it seems to be quite distinct from
Lepidostrobus, and to bear a considerable likeness to some undoubted Sigillariostrobi,
especially 8, Goldenbergi, Ze1tLER.*

Possibly Sigillariostrobus, as at present constituted, may have to be broken up into
two or more genera, in which case it may be that S. Crepini and our Spencerites may
still be brought together. Until, however, we are acquainted with the internal
structure of the Sigillarian fructifications, no definitive re-arrangement can be
