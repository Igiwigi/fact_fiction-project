intensity comparable to those of the maximum region of the electric spectrum. If,
therefore, we wish to produce intense calorific effects by invisible rays, we must choose
those emitted by an intensely luminous source. The question then arises, how are the
invisible calorific rays to be isolated from the visible ones. The interposition of an
opaque screen suffices to cut off the visible spectrum of the electric light, and leaves us
the invisible calorific rays to operate upon at our pleasure. Sir WiLLJAx HERSCHEL
experimented thus when he sought, by concentrating them, to render the invisible rays
of the sun visible. But to form a spectrum in which the invisible rays shall be com-
pletely separated from the visible ones, a narrow slit or a small aperture is necessary ;
and this circumstance renders the amount of heat separable by prismatic analysis very
limited. If we wish to ascertain what the intensely concentrated invisible rays can
accomplish, we must devise some other mode of detaching them from their visible com-
panions. We must, in fact, discover a substance which shall filter the composite radia-
tion of a luminous source by stopping the visible rays and allowing the invisible ones
free transmission.

Could we obtain a black elementary body thoroughly homogeneous, and with all its
