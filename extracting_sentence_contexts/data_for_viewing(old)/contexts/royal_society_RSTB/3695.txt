in this case which explains the apparent anomaly, and that is that at the operation
it was found that conductivity was present in the facial nerve when it was tested
with the electrode. The same thing was noticed in the case of HackENBRUCH, in
which the paralysis had lasted for seven and three-quarter years, and began to clear
up four and a-half months after the operation, as already noticed in an earlier part of
this paper (p. 108).

In other cases operated on, after long intervals, there appears to have been little
in the way of result, and probably the fact of the facial nerve having reunited to a
certain extent, and thus keeping up the nutrition of the muscles or part of them,
accounts for the recovery in such cases as those of BARDENaEUER. It is not yet
definitely determined what length of time the muscles may be cut off from the
influence of the central nervous system and yet be reparable, but if it is found at
the operation that they are wholly unresponsive to direct galvanic stimulation the
prospects are not good, Examination of electrical reactions through the skin with
negative result is not conclusive proof that reactions are absent. It is necessary
to puncture the skin to permit a platinum electrode to reach the muscle substance
directly.
