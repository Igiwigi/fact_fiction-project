zone increases in thickness, enabling them still to maintain their connexion with the

of Mr. Bixxsy, but which is really a state of the common Lepidodendron selaginoides. When M. RExAavuLT denies that a Lepidodendroid state of this supposed Sigillarian
plant exists, he overlooks the fact that Mr. Bixxgy long ago described and figured a
partially decorticated specimen in this condition under the name of Lepidodendron
vaseulare.* In that memoir Mr. BixNey correctly points out that the plant only
differs from his Sigillara vascularis in the absence from the former of an exogenous
zone. Fig. 1 represents a transverse section of a branch of this plant, enlarged about
13 diameters, its actual diameter in the longer direction being nearly '8.
