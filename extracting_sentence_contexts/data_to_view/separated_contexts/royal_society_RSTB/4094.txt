But when we ask where lie the entrances of the streams of air indicated by the


TRANSPIRATION AND STOMATAL APERTURE. 417

outer arrows in fig, 1 which emerge inside the chamber, the answer is not clear. It
is certain, I think, that the stomatal surface of the leaf outside the porometer
provides ample inflow,* since cutting the leaf through close to the porometer chamber
does not seem to increase the rate of flow, and this ean only mean that the fall of the
column of water is ruled by the capacity for outflow and not by inflow. However
this may be, there remains the fact that the flow of the air is through intercellular
spaces. This raises the question whether or no these passages can be supposed to
vary in size under changing conditions. From what is known of the varying turgor
of leavest it does not seem impossible that this is so.
