obtained separately unless « = 0 or 27 which case the cosine or sine = 0.

How far the series is to be continued depends on the periodic fluctuations of the us,
and may be found by trial, or by BesseL's expression for the 8quares of the residual

errors. In any case it should not be carried further than the order = as after that the
coefficients coalesce. BrsSEL has shown this for a=0; and it can easily be proved to
hold good when « is a submultiple of } and þ a multiple of a.

For the horary groups I find the fourth order sufficient. These horary groups might
be combined in triple sets; but, as I have said, there is a difficulty in the interpolation
due to the fact that while «/, the mean of any three, is multiplied by cosine or sine of 0,

the first and third components of it should be multiplied by the same functions of 9—6
and 0+b. This, however, may easily be corrected. Take the case of A : the effect of
three components to determine this is :—
