66 and 67; and ZL. alpinum, fig. 77). This question can only be
ely answered. by observations of development, which can hardly be expected in
25 there are, however, facts bearing on the point which may be acquired from
Apical parts of this remarkable cone ; it will be seen that in fig. 95, as the apex is
roached, the sporangia are successively smaller; those close to the apex have been
‘in their growth, and appear to contain no spores; the cavity of the
rangium is, however, traversed by cellular processes, rising from the base, and
7 upwards (figs. 99, 100); apparently these bands of sterile tissue extended
he upper wall of the sporangium, but I have been unable to establish beyond
ubt, the fact of a tissue-connection between them and the wall; had that been
own to exist, the correspondence between these and the sterile trabecule of Tsoetes
vuld have been demonstrated, and, from the appearance of some of the sections, I
a inclined to the belief that this is their real nature ; in the absence of such proof it

may be held as a possible alternative view, that they are merely upgrowths of {
archesporial pad, like those in certain species of Lycopodiwm, but on a larg
and that those upgrowths are specially large in the abortive sporangia ; but
the former view the more probable.
