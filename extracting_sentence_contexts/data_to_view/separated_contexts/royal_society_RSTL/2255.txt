No action
took place upon the metals except when the electrodes were in communication, and
then the action upon the zine was only in proportion to the decomposition in the
experimental cell ; for when the current was retarded there, it was retarded also in
the battery, and no waste of the powers of the metal was incurred.

1002. In consequence of this circumstance, the acid in the cells remained active
for a very much longer time than usual. In fact, time did not tend to lower it in
any sensible degree; for whilst the metal was preserved to be acted upon at the
proper moment, the acid also was preserved almost at its first strength. Hence a
constancy of action far beyond what can be obtained with the use of common zinc.

1003. Another excellent consequence was the renewal, during the interval of rest,
between two experiments of the firxst and most efficient state.
