It is easily
obtained, and has a silvery whiteness in appearance, which gives distinctness to the
figures. With regard to the plate on which the figure is to form, its composition,
like that of the dust, is of no importance; the shape determines the figure, not its
constitution. Glass, for several reasons, is the best material for the plate, but copper,
zine, silver, antimony or other metal may be used, or ebonite, celluloid, black india-
rubber, cardboard, &c., in fact, the receiving surface is not necessarily a_ solid
substance ; mercury in a square vessel will have deposited on it a figure similar to
that on a piece of glass of the same size and shape, and, still more, the surface of the
glass plate may be coated with oil, gum, copal-varnish, &e., and the cross will form
as if they were not present. Obviously, with regard to the visibility of the figures
formed, the nature of the plate is of considerable importance ; on some substances the
figures are more easily seen than on others. In the following experiments glass
plates have been used, except when mention is made to the contrary.

_ Passing from the materials used to the active agent in producing the figures,
namely heat, it should be stated that there are many different ways of applying it,
and different results are produced.
