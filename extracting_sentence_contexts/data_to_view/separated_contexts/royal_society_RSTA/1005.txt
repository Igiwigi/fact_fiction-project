The enhancement of the mechanical properties
for these magnetic hydrogels can be explained by considering that the columnar structures are
percolating. Applying the theoretical prediction for the mechanical properties of mixtures [36],
we obtain

mix = PGE + (1+ ©)Gh, (2.1)

rw

where superscript °=’, ” correspond, respectively, for the storage and loss moduli, & is the volume
fraction of columnar structures, and subscripts mix, c, m refer, respectively, to mixture, columnar
structures and dispersion medium, respectively. Concerning the fact that the enhancement of
the viscoelastic moduli is stronger for nanoparticles than for microparticles, we propose two
complementary reasons. First, because the surface of the particles is coated by peptides and
for a given amount of mass, nanoparticles have much larger (approx. 10 times more) surface
than microparticles, it is expected that integration of the particle structures is more effective
for nanoparticles, which should result in a stronger enhancement. Secondly, because magnetic
interaction is stronger for microparticles, the result for these particles was more the formation of
columnar structures, mainly composed of particles, separated from the hydrogel medium, than
the actuation of the particles as cross-linking agents between peptide fibres.
