Being now in possession of a new instrument, I next
attempted to gain, by means of it, some illustration of the
changes, which the vision of short-sighted persons undergoes
from age. It has been very generally, if not universally, asserted by
systematic writers upon vision, that the short-sighted are ren-
dered by age fitter for seeing distant objects than they were
in their youth. But this opinion appears to me unfounded in
fact, and to rest altogether upon a false analogy. If those
who possess ordinary vision, when young, become, from the
flatness of the cornea, or other changes in the mere structure
of the eye, long-sighted as they approach to old age, it fol-
lows, that the short-sighted must, from similar changes, be-
come better fitted to see distant objects. Such appears to have
been their reasoning.
