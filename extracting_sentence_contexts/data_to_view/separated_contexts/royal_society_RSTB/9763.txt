These studies have led to probabilistic
models of fossil occurrence that reflect the underlying controls on the fossil
record in local sections [10], and they improve upon ones that assume uniform
preservation. These models show, for example, that the difference in age
between when a species first appears locally in the fossil record and when it
first appeared in the region can often be up to a million years or more [11]. Similarly, the stratigraphic record can cause the last occurrences of species to
be clustered at particular layers in a pattern that might lead one to interpret
it as a mass extinction, when in fact that clustering is controlled by processes
of sedimentation [12]. These modelling studies and numerous field studies
