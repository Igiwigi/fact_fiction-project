where j,k =0,...,3. Note that these matrices are symmetric because J-1=-J=J! and JZ is self-
adjoint.

We now consider the behaviour of the two additional eigenvalues in the neighbourhood of cy.
Below, we will show the following result.

Proposition 5.1. If the generalized kernel of Lo is exactly four-dimensional, the essential spectrum does
not contain zero, and H'(co) £0, then the splitting eigenvalues are} = Oe"),

We remark that this proposition holds in the framework with weighted spaces (in the setting
with unweighted spaces where zero is usually contained in the essential spectrum, the conditions
are usually not satisfied and one needs to investigate whether the effects of the essential spectrum
can be neglected). The result follows from the fact that two of the four eigenvalues of £ are always
zero. It suffices to calculate the leading-order terms of the eigenvalues for the perturbed operator
Lat c=cy + €. By restricting the operator in the invariant subspace G4, the question reduces to
the perturbation of the matrix
