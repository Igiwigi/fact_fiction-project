a saturation value as the electromotive force is increased.

The fact that the source of the rays is discontinuous must also not be forgotten,
for with strong fields all the ions produced by the action of one spark may have time
to travel across to the other plate, under the influence of the electric field, before the
next spark takes place.

The fact that the carriers in hydrogen, as RurHERFoRDt has shown, travel
several times as fast as in air, explains why the phenomenon under consideration was
only observed in the former gas. With greater differences of potential, or a smaller
distance between the plates, it would no doubt be observed in air also.

The fact that the nuclei produced by the action of ultra-violet light on a
negatively electrified zinc plate whether in air or hydrogen, require just the same
degree of supersaturation in order that they may act as centres of condensation as
those produced by Réntgen rays or Uranium rays, is strong evidence that the carriers
of the electricity in all these cases are of the same nature. RurHEerrorp{ has already
proved this in quite a different way by his measurements of the velocity with which
the carriers move in an electric field.

The very considerable degree of supersaturation necessary to make condensation
take place on these nuclei is of itself sufficient to prove that the particles which carry
off the negative charge from the zine-plate are not of the nature of dust particles, but
on the contrary must be of almost molecular dimensions (vide ‘ Phil. Trans.,’ loc. cit.,
p. 306).
