that of the rest of the rock. Evidence is thus afforded that we are dealing with
flattened cones in which the empty sporangia are represented by casts of the cavity with
remains of the wall on the surface.

It may be mentioned that observations with reflected light and also some of the
film-pulls have shown indications of the elongated cells of the sporangial wall radiating
between the stalk and the line of dehiscence. The wall is not, however, sufficiently
preserved for detailed description or figures.

Even had no further evidence been obtained it would be justifiable to regard the
sporangial nature of the appendages as established by the consistent body of facts
regarding their shape and the presence of the line of dehiscence. A fortunate prepara-
tion, however, enables us to add the conclusive fact of the presence of spores in the
sporangia. The sporangium in question is the lower one on the left in fig. 26. On
examining the carbonaceous material in the film-pulls a distinction had been drawn
between homogeneous opaque portions that were apparently remains of the sporangial
wall and more or less rounded or oval areas with a reticulate structure. The latter
were suggestive of being remains of the walls of spores but it was not possible to identify
them with certainty.

The next film-pull to that shown in fig. 26 was treated with hydrofluoric acid, to
remove the yellow mineral matter and leave only the carbonaceous remains. In the
position of the dark mass seen on the left-hand side of the incomplete sporangium this
treatment revealed an indefinite mass of such possible spores and a few more isolated
groups. â€˜The appearance of these groups was significant and characteristic, as is shown
