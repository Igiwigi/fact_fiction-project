similar parameters in J,(0), the two theories will show roughly the same decline of rate
with absolute pressure. This is a mere suggestion of comparable orders of magnitude; the
pressures for a given value of the rate will in fact differ by the factor /,,. TABLE 1, VALUES oF A, AND f,: (a) FOR A=1, (f) FOR THESE A

The comparison with Kasselâ€™s theory may be concluded at this point; the comparison
of the parameters has to a limited extent strengthened the formal similarity noted in (72).
