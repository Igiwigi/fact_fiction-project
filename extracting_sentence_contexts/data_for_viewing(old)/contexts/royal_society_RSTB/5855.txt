It will be noticed that the notochord is usually lacking if the floor of the neural groove
is lacking and is usually present if that structure is present. There are, however, one
or two exceptions. Thus, in 173, the notochord is only present in the anterior part of
the embryo, although the floor of the neural groove is present throughout. Perhaps
this is due to an insufficiency of notochord material having been regenerated. In 180
(p. 188), there was a notochord present although there was no floor of the neural groove.
It is possible that this notochord was regenerated ; but even if it was, the fact that
there could be a notochord in the absence of the floor of the neural groove probably
indicates that the presumptive notochord stretches some little distance further
longitudinally than the presumptive floor of the neural tube.

It is interesting to note that when the notochord is lacking from part of the embryo,
the somites have, in that part, become fused in the mid-line (173, and another undescribed
specimen). A similar phenomenon is known in Amphibia.

4. Discussion of the Period during which the Mesoderm is formed.

The phenomena of regeneration make it clear that no discussion of the developmental
factors at work in the blastoderm at this stage can be complete if it is confined to a
