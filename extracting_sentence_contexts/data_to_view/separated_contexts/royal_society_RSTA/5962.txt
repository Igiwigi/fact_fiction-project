It is important now to ‘dissect’
from C the effect of the prestress T and, as a consequence, to obtain tensor E. It will be shown below that the current prestress state T of the homogenized material can
directly be linked to the preload state P = {Pi,...,Pn,} of the lattice. In fact, by observing that
equation (3.11) represents the second-order incremental strain energy, equal to W2(L) = S(L) -L/2,
an equivalence analogous to that expressed by equation (3.11) can be obtained considering the
first-order increment of the strain energy, Wj (L) = T - L. Thus, the first-order term can be identified
as the average work done by the prestress state P during the lattice deformation q(q*(L), L) induced by L. Accordingly, the following equivalence can be stated:

‘Lo= fp + qq" (L), L), (3.13)

lattice
where vector fp collects the forces that emerge at the nodes of the unit cell and are in equilibrium
with the axial preload P, in the current configuration assumed as reference.
