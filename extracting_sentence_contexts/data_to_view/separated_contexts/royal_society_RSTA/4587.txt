The tyres are modelled 2
with impact functions that switch on as soon as the distance between the wheel centre and the tyre aed
becomes less than the wheel radius, where the lateral force on a tyre is dependent on the slip angle 22
and the vertical force on the tyre. External forces such as thrust and aerodynamic forces, known as : Ss
action-only forces, are then added. The value of such a software tool for a company lies in the fact : s
that the equations of motion are constructed automatically, allowing the engineer to focus on the : s
engineering aspects of the system, and not the derivation of complex equations. As MSC.ADAMS : &

cannot be coupled to the DST, a process was developed to translate the MSC.ADAMS model to
SimMechanics, which can be coupled to the DST. While there are important differences between
the two modelling packages, the development of the SimMechanics model followed that of the
ADAMS model.
