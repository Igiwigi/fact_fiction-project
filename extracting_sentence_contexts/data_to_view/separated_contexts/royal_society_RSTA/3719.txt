introduced in § 25. One such determination will
be worked out presently ; here it is important to observe that it is effectively unique. The conditions (71) require, in fact, that the discontinuities of u_,... should be
arranged so as to cancel exactly those of u,,... Now let us suppose that two
sets of functions w_, . . ., and w_+ Au_,.. . have been found, both of which obey
all the conditions imposed upon the functions u_, ... ; their differences Aw_, . . .
have no discontinuities at the aperture, and no singularities on the nearer side
(z <2’); thus the disturbance represented by Au_, . . . belongs to the disturbance
