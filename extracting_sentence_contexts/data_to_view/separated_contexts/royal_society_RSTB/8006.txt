However, these increases found to be necessarily associated with sleep as
were observed in regions close to auditory cortex that opposed to an extended period of consolidation
showed an elevated response to pseudowords in our awake. However, given the behavioural data reviewed
meta-analysis. This interaction serves to increase the previously (Dumay & Gaskell 2007) and the fact that
neural response difference between pre-existing words the same-day training also included ample time for
and pseudowords, rather than decreasing this effect as awake consolidation (4 h), sleep is likely to be the prin-
predicted by figure 3d. Thus, the reactivation of cipal driver of neocortical changes observed in the
recently acquired pseudoword representations has comparison of items learnt on the same or previous
the opposite effect on measured neural activity to the day to scanning. Comparison of untrained words and
difference between familiar words and unfamiliar pseu- pseudowords also permitted an assessment of simple
dowords.
