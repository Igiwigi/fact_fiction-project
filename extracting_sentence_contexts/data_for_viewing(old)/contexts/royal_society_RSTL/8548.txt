axil of which the adjacent strobilus has sprung. Each strobilus consists of a linear
series of yerticils of bractigerous disks, disposed at intervals of about 125. Vach disk
on leaving the axis first curves s0mewhat downwards, and then upwards and outwards,
The marginal fringe of bracts continues in the latter course, so that their tips stand out
free, asin A. Dawson, instead of coming into close contact with the next superior yerticil.
Each of these bractigerous disks sustains a stratum of sporangia upon its upper surface.
The exact arrangement of the latter cannot be ascertained with accuracy ; but I am quite
satisfied that they are disposed, as in A. Dawsoni, in more than one concentric ring.
Neither have I been able to determine with absolute certainty the exact number of
bracts in each verticil; but it is obyiously about fifteen or sixteen, which is a rather
smaller number than in A. Dawsone.

The preceding facts suffice to show that whilst yarious authors have figured different
modifications of a common type of Asterophyllitean fruits, none of them obtained any
clue to the internal organization of that type. 4. Dawsons has given us that clue,
Secondary modifications have doubtless existed amongst the various species; but that
the external forms and the inward organization of these fruits of Asferophyllites and
Sphenophyllum are now substantially correlated is a fact about which I entertain no
doubt.

An important question Â«till seeks an answer, viz. What is Calamostachys Binneyand
Mr. Bixxey and Mr. CarrvutHers both reply, it is the fruit of a Calamite. But my
