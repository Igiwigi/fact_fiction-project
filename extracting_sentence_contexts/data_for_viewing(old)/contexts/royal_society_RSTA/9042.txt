e.g., U*, U*, UV’, &c., and compared the result with that obtained by a direct integration.
By choosing as many functions as there were unknowns, a sufficient of equations were
obtained to evaluate them.

The result obtained by MAxwetut for the stress in a gas is, making the necessary
changes in the notation,

E Ou , 9 (OU Ov) , Ow, Bu PT 3 ire
P,.-—p = — 2px + in( 5 er Oy + oi.) + aT ae tT av . (12.01)

An examination of his work, however, reveals that a numerical error has been made
in the calculation of the last term, and that a term involving a time derivative has been
omitted without any express mention of the fact. The above equation should read

involving a change in the coefficient of V’L and the addition of the last term. This is
evidently in complete agreement with the result obtained in § 11, if we write||
