The values found are
shown in Table VII. This experiment gives a difference of 0-002° C. between rising
and falling readings.

(iUILLAUME* gives evidence to show that the difference between the internal pressures
with rising and falling readings is of the order of 40 mm. of mercury, equivalent to
about 0-004,° C. The smaller difference found above is probably due to the fact that
the agitation of the thermometers in the water bath is very considerable, since not only
is there vibration from the stirrer, but the thermometers themselves are continually
