formation and the condition of the nucleus, disprove Born’s theory. Both these
objections are removed by the conception of yolk formation which I have given
above.

In this connection Munson’s account of Limulus is exceptionally interesting. In
the ova of this animal, not only does yolk formation commence with the passage of
the egg into the internal cavity of the ovary, but also with its separation from the
follicle cells originally surrounding it. The egg is thus, at the commencement of
yolk formation, cut off from the source which supplied it with food material during
earlier stages, a fact which tends to confirm my suggestion, that “yolk formation”
is only the final stage of a long period of metabolic activity.

There is yet another feature in the behaviour of the Limulus egg, as described by
Monson, which tends to throw light on the question of the relation of yolk formation
to the general cell-metabolism.. It concerns the behaviour of the nucleolus. The
separation of the egg from its follicle cells in Limulus is not the only event which
synchronises with the commencement of yolk formation, for this moment is also marked
by the total disappearance of the nucleolus. In considering the behaviour of the

_latter structure in Antedon, and in attempting to harmonise the absence of any trace
of correlation between its activity and the commencement of yolk formation with the
fact that this activity ceased entirely with the completion of the latter process,
