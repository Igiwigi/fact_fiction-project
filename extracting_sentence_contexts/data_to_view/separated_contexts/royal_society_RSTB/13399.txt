Calls may or may not be part of babbling depending on the call and the species. Song in songbirds, humming-
birds and greater sac-winged bats is shaped by VPL. The figure summarizes data from a variety of species that appear to support the working hypothesis that
babbling or some form of precursor vocalization in infancy may be a requirement for VPL, which often results in complex mature vocal repertoires.

play also similarly involves repetitive production of similar infants across the first year [30,31], another fact hinting at
vocal types. Given this similarity with object play, self- the endogenous motivation for protophone production.
motivated protophone production has also been called

‘vocal play’ [22] and has been thought of as a kind of practice,

just as object play has been treated as a learning endeavour. (f) Babbling after infant tracheostomy
Extensive exercise in babbling during the first year does not

appear to be a requirement for learning to talk, however.

Protophones in the first year are frequently produced with no lize because they require tracheostomy to breathe. After
