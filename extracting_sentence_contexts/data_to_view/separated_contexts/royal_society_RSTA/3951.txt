Alternatively, reference materials can be prepared in-house. For : 3
example, matrix-matched standards ina tablet form were prepared to enable quantitative analysis
by means of direct solid sampling with laser ablation ICP-MS [46]. mea)
An important point in the evaluation of MS results for quantitative analysis is to verify the :
presence of adduct ions and the occurrence of fragmentation during and after ionization (in- a]
source decay and post-source decay). In fact, in some cases, quantitative analyses are based on DNS
such adduct or fragment ion signals (single/multiple reaction monitoring mode). In these cases, area
one needs to select the adduct/ fragment signals that represent high sensitivity (ie. correlate with a)
concentrations of the original analytes) and high repeatability. .

3. Unconventional matrices in clinical analysis, toxicology and forensics

Because most of the unconventional matrices, highlighted here, are quite different in terms
of their main chemical composition and physical properties, the early stages of analysis
procedures have to be customized to specific matrices.
