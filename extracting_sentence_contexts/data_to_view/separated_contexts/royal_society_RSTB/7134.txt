nerve or nerves connected with the unusually swollen medulla oblongata (Nielsen 1942,
p. 102). My specimen of Caturus, being more complete than C. groenlandicus, shows the
lateral cranial canal to have no external outlet at all, so that any nervous function seems
ruled outâ€”a conclusion which is supported by the fact that in Boreosomus the homologous
opening is sometimes lacking. Moreover, Nielsen notes that there has hitherto been no
function satisfactorily ascribed to the fossa bridgei, and that in Acipenser and Polyodon (the
second of which has the communicating opening) it is filled with fatty tissue.
