the rise in the temperature of the thermometer-coils due to current-heating was
always the same, and consequent errors were eliminated, a point to which I attach
considerable importance.

“The value of R; — R, in thermometer AB was 6'88815; therefore a difference of
1 ohm at 50° C. indicated a difference of 14°-5177 C., and as

the degree value of any bridge-reading at other temperatures can be deduced.

“There was no difficulty, in the arrangement above described, of reading with
certainty a difference of ygg5° C., and, as an illustration, I may mention the fact that
if the thermometers were placed in separate hypsometers side by side on the bench
and one of the hypsometers was then removed to the ground (about 3 feet below),
the difference in the bridge-wire reading thus caused slightly exceeded °4 millim.”

In the paper above referred to, further particulars are given regarding the
standardisation of these thermometers. During the experiments there described

they were used to determine the rate of rise in the temperature of the calorimeter,
whereas, in the work I am now describing,

they were used chiefly as detectors of any
