In this approach, one 1B
uses the forecasts available to solve a sequence of MDP formulations over time. At each decision : =
epoch, a conventional MDP that incorporates the forecasts available is solved, the optimal first 8
period action is taken, and this process is repeated at the next decision epoch. In particular, the : 4
MDPs that are used by MPC at each decision epoch do not explicitly model, within the MDP, De
the fact that the decision-maker will have available a new set of forecasts at each future decision : 3
epoch within the decision horizon associated with the MDP. This is also the case in adaptations : 3
of standard MPC to the setting where the forecasts contain probabilistic information [16]. By 8

contrast, the MDPs introduced by this paper model the fact that the forecasts are continually
‘refreshed’ over the MDP’s decision horizon, and do so via a formulation that preserves the
computational tractability of the MDP.
