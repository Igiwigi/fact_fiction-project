39 Primata (39 species of primates). Roughly two-thirds of pri-
mate species reported to engage in intragroup coalitions
belonged to the family Cercopithecidae (23 species of maca-
ques and baboons). We also located primate data on
intragroup coalitions formed by two species of lemurs, three
species of spider and howler monkeys, seven species of capu-
chin and squirrel monkeys, and four species of apes.

We used multinomial models to estimate the overall pre-
dicted probabilities of coalitions by females only, males only
or both sexes. Contrary to our first prediction, female-only
coalitions were not more likely than male-only coalitions
(figure 1, Model 1). In fact, the probability of female-only
coalitions in a typical mammal (median = 0.18, 90% credible
interval = 0.01-0.47) was lower than the probability of male-
only coalitions (0.33, 0.04-0.67) and the most likely state
was coalitions by both sexes (0.41, 0.14-0.68). Thus, only
34% of the posterior probability supported our prediction
of female-only coalitions being more likely than male-only
coalitions. The phylogenetic signal was moderate (median
A=0.34, 90% Cl =0.14-0.54). In sum, conditional on having
any coalitions at all, the typical extant mammal is just as
likely to have female-only, male-only or both-sex coalitions.

This general pattern did not change appreciably when com-
