Realist models are representational models—idealized mathematical
representations of physical objects and processes considered, again, as part of a given theory, as
a conglomerate of concepts, which also gives an interpretation to the model it uses. As I said, for
simplicity, I also speak of this interpretation as an interpretation of this theory itself. All realism in physics (or elsewhere) is conceptual realism, as was acutely realized by Einstein,
who saw the mediation of mathematical concepts as irreducible and essential, and who saw the
practice of theoretical physics as that of the invention of new concepts through which one can
approach reality.> He argued that a viable realist representation of physical reality could only
be achieved by means of conceptual construction, ‘the free choice of [mathematical] concepts’,
rather than by means of observable facts themselves, which Einstein sees as the empiricist
‘philosophical prejudice’, found, for example, in E. Mach’s philosophy [16, p. 47]. A theory,
however, always adds dimensions that are other than mathematical to the mathematical concepts
of its mathematical models, and concepts that are other than mathematical.
