they are said to be “united by coste,” in Mussa they are usually described as “free.”

Yet, in all three genera, the soft parts of adjacent polyps are continuous. In Mussa,
it is true, groups of adjacent polyps become independent of one another in the corallum
correlated with the branching growth,

The facts show three different forms of the extracalycinal skeletal parts. In
Galaxea, the cost are narrow, and the intermediate space between calyces is entirely
occupied by dissepiments. In Heliastrwa, the costee are so wide as to come usually
into contact, dissepiments being developed between them. In Mussa, there are no
dissepiments between the costa.

The mode of increase is essentially the same in all three genera, so far as the skeletal
structures afford evidence. Side branches are in all cases in open communication at
their origin with the oral surface of a main branch.
