Such a possibility does not arise with D/¢ = 0, for as D’ contains no adjustable
constant such as \” it has no integral save ¢ = 0, unless the boundary equations
contain a term f independent of the (y)'s. And if they do contain such a term, any
multiple of an integral fails to satisfy them. Thus, in the theory of membranes, if we
put D = d°/dx*+0*/dy’, and ¢ for the small displacement of the membrane from a
fixed plane, then in the case of the membrane at rest D'f = 0, and ¢ is commonly
given at the boundary, its values there being fio, fv, «++ fro

On the other hand, for the vibrations of the membrane (9/+)*) ¢ = 0 the boundary
condition is commonly ¢ = 0, corresponding to the vanishing of all the (/')’s.

To return to the general form of D’: let P, be the integral desired ; (P;):, (P:)s, ---
(Px)11 the initial guess and successive approximations to P, The fact that any
multiple of an integral is itself an integral allows us to put for the body-points of

which is more general than (2) of § 3°2°1 by reason of the factor y. The boundary
