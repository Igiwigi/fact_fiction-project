The electrogram given in fig. 8 is one of those. The meteorograms
have also consequently been plotted with the time increasing from right to left. This
fact should be borne in mind when comparing this record with the other records in
this paper. During the passage overhead of the northern fringe of the thundercloud the electro-
gram showed two distinct changes. When the front part of the fringe came overhead
the field became strongly negative, but the intensity of the field was only a small fraction
of that attained in those cases in which the centres of the clouds passed overhead.
