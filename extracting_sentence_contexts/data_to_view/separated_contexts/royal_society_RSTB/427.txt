Now that we have the situations of the fibres expressed in terms of the average
length of the capsules of each group, we need not keep the decimal point if we regard
the capsule as divided into a hundred parts, and then take the figure as a whole
number, so that in Table I. the limits of the representation of the protrusion of the
tongue become 7 and 24, i.¢., ¢3o and %y'5:

This mode of treating the figures has- this great advantage, that whatever the
length of the different capsules may be in any group, we can compare the function of
the fibres in similar parts. At the same time this mode of extending the differentiation of the capsule has this
disadvantage, viz., that, although taken absolutely, az is represented by the fraction
zi, we obtained the movement from the most anterior millimetre of the capsule,
yet in converting j!; into a decimal to two places, we necessarily obtain 34; = ‘07,
and then, in regarding the capsule for purposes of relative comparison as divided into

100 parts (dropping the decimal point), we thus obtain the figure 7, meaning the first
seven-hundredths, as representing the first portion at which the movement occurred. Tn fact, in attempting to analyse and to compare the results of each experiment,
i.e., the fractions, we found it impossible to employ the method of a common denomi-
nator, and therefore selected, at Mr. Gorcn’s suggestion, the two places of decimals. We were obliged to take two places of decimals, since, as a glance at Table I.*

shows, one place of decimals would not have given the differentiation we have dis-
covered to exist, though at the same time it was clear to us that two places would so
extend our subdivisions of the capsule as to make it difficult to convey the absolute
expression of the amount (i.¢., extent) of representation. These averages are set out in the last column in Table I., in which the movements
are also arranged in their order from before back.
