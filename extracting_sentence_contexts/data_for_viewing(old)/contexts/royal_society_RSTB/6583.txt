have seven bands of pigment each. The eleventh segment tapers posteriorly and
has seven bands of pigment. It ends in four conical lobes, two dorsal and two
ventral, of variable size according to their stage of turgescence. The body is free
from hairs and locomotory pads. The integument is very thin and shining. The

larva is apneustic.

VIII—Sup-FAMILy ScIARINAE WINNERTZ

Sciara

The literature on the Sciarinae is more extensive than that of any other sub-family
of the Mycetophilidae owing to the fact that all the Mycetophilidae which have any
economic importance belong to this sub-family. The larvae of many species have
been recorded as root pests on various potted plants, young wheat, orchids, peas,
lettuces, cucumbers, and tomatoes.

Boucné. (1834) described the larva and pupa of Sciara vitripennis and three other
species of Sciara. His description and figures of the mouth parts are inaccurate and
he mistook the number of spiracles. Durour (1834), LaBouLBENE (1863), and
Perris (1871) described several species of Sciara, but added little to the existing
knowledge of their morphology.

Hexcer (1851) gave a detailed description of the larva and pupa of Sciara fuscipes.
His figures of the labrum, mandible, and maxilla are drawn with great care, but
