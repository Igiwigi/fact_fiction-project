In comparison, the equivalent m-CAP scheme can transmit Nlog, M bits during each symbol
period and its transmission efficiency is tm—cap =logz M. Clearly, in order for the scheme to
exhibit larger transmission efficiency than the m-CAP scheme with the same number of subbands,


the number of bits b; encoded on the subband index needs to be larger than the number of bits
(N — Na) - logy M that could be transmitted on the inactive subbands in m-CAP. It can be shown
that this requires the number of subbands N to be larger or equal than the QAM constellation
order M, which means in practice that transmission efficiency improvements can be achieved
only for relatively low constellation orders M (e.g. M : 4, 16), as otherwise the large number of
subbands required renders the scheme impractical. Most interestingly, however, the scheme can
provide improved energy efficiency over the m-CAP scheme exhibiting with the same spectral
efficiency owing to the fact that the subband index bits are transmitted over the channel only
by the status of the subbands during each symbol period (i.e. which subset is active) without
consuming any energy. Finally, SI-CAP provides a slightly better PAPR ratio than m-CAP due to
the activation of a lower number of subbands during each symbol period which results in a lower
probability of constructive interference of the particular harmonics [123].

(iv) Non-orthogonal or super-Nyquist m-carrierless amplitude and phase

In this variant, typically referred to as super-Nyquist (SN-CAP), the spacing between the CAP
subbands is reduced in order to increase the spectral efficiency of the scheme [96,124—126].
However, this results in spectral overlap (band interference) between adjacent bands which
destroys the orthogonality of the respective pulse shaping filters and in the distortion of the
transmitted waveforms. The basic idea is that the induced signal degradation is not severe,
