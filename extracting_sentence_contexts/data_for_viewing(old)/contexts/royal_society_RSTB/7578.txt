for ciliary feeding.

Some larvae were cultured in Erdschreiber solution, and grew larger than those cultured
in sea water, but their increased growth was probably due to the Erdschreiber solution
maintaining a multiplying stock of food materials between periodic inoculations, and so
a more constant supply of food for the larvae, rather than to the fact that the larvae derived
any direct benefit from the Erdschreiber itself.

12. Discussion

Hitherto the accounts of the early cleavage stages of the Enteropneusta have been few
and somewhat contradictory. Bateson (1884) assumed that in Saccoglossus kowalevskyi
cleavage was regular, but Davis (1908) obtained a single series of cleavage stages of
S. pusillus and observed that the first two cleavages were total and equal, but that the sub-
sequent ones were irregular. The blastomeres of the animal pole were noticeably smaller
than those of the vegetative, and the third cleavage resembled the spiral type. The fourth
was a bilateral one. He noted a resemblance to cleavage in Amphioxus, as described by
Hatschek (1881). Heider (1909) and Stiasny (1913, 1914a@ and 5) are not in agreement
