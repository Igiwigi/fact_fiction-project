Moreover, the common carotid arteries occupy a position dorsal to the. cesophagus, and.
do so from a very early date ; this is not what one would expect if they had originally
occupied a ventral situation. From the observations detailed in the following pages
I have been led to assign the origin of the subclavians to the ventral extremities of the
third or carotid arches, and that of the common carotid stems to the third arches and
the dorsal vessel above each, as is represented in fig. 2, Plate 22. Under this
scheme the numerous branches of the common carotid are to be regarded in the same
light as visceral and parietal branches of the aorta.

DEVELOPMENT OF THE SUBCLAVIAN AND CAROTID ARTERIES.

From the examination of a large number of Chick and Duck embryos I have become
convinced that the theories now universally held are not in accordance with the facts of
development. In relation to the subclavian arteries, the origin of which, as has been ex-
plained, RaTHKE* assigns to the aortic roots, it ought to be possible to trace their gradual

assigns the origin of the subclavian arteries of Birds to the dorsal ends of the fourth arches, he admits

change of position, and to see the steps of the process by which they are supposed to
pass from the dorsal to the ventral end of the arch, and finally to observe their gradual
fusion with the bases of the carotid arteries to form the innominate trunks. It should
