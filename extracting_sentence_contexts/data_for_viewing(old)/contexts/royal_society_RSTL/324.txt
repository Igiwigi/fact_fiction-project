It was very natural for Jupiter to diminish in brightness,
when it approached 80 near to the moon, then almost at its
full, as to be seen at the same time in the field of the telescope,
which was, in fact, the circumstance of this observation ; but
I could not observe any progressive variation of light in the
eastern and western, equally luminous, disks, proportional to
their distances from the limb of the moon, much less a real
indistinctness ; and this neither when the limbs of the two
planets were nearly in contact, nor when Jupiter was partly,
or about one half, covered by the moon

It was a sight truly gratifying to an eye accustomed to the
light of the moon, or in general to similar observations, to be-
hold how Jupiter, at its immersion, as well as emersion, being
half, or more than half, covered by the moon, exhibited its
belts and other parts,-as distinctly, close to the limb of the
