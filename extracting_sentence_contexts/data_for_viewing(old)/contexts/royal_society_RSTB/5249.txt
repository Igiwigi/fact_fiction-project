shape the parenchyma forms a connecting bridge between the two loops (Plate 5, figs.
30, 34, 35); then for a short distance upwards the place of the parenchymatous bridge
is taken by a row or two of small tracheides (Plate 5, fig. 31). Even after the character-
istic form has been arrived at the leaf-trace continues to increase in size, thus keeping
pace with the increase in diameter of the petiole.

The Pinna-Trace—From P. Bertranp’s work* we know that in C. antiqua the
pinna-traces are nipped off as closed rings alternately from the two ends of the petiolar
bundle. In C. australis the process is the same. Several traces in various stages of
formation were figured in my earlier paper.t In the present material the best preserved
trace is the one shown in Plate 5, figs. 32, 33, where an earlier stage in the formation
of a pinna-trace is seen. A later stage is represented in Plate 5, fig. 36. It is a curious
fact that while pinna-traces have frequently been seen, no pinnz have yet been found ;
nor have any pinna-traces been observed detached from the petiolar bundle.

The Aphlebie.—Very little was previously known of these organs in C. australis
and several points concerning them are still obscure. It seems fairly certain that they
are the proximal homologues of the pinne, for their relation to the primary rachis
and probably also the mode of origin of their vascular supply are essentially the same.
