122 Mr. Ivory on a new Method of deducing

indebted for the first accurate knowledge of the laws of the
planetary motions. This step in our knowledge of the uni-
verse was reserved for Sir Isaac NEwTon. The principal and
leading discovery of that great philosopher consisted in gene-
ralizing the laws of Kern ; in proving that they are neces-
sary consequences of a more general fact, namely, that all the
planets are continually deflected from a rectilineal motion to-
wards the sun in the inverse proportion of the squares of their
distances from that body. He demonstrated that the motions of
such a system of bodies must be performed in the conic sections,
having the sun in the focus, the 8pecies of the curve depend-
ing upon the proportion of the rectilineal velocity to the quan-
tity of the deflection towards the common centre. This theory
comprehends an infinite variety of motions, all flowing from
one common principle ; and the ellipse alone, by the changes
of form which it undergoes according to the degrees of its
eccentricity, seems, at one extreme, when it is greatly elon=
gated, as well adapted to account for the phenomena of' the
comets, as it is, at the other extreme, when it differs little from
a circle, to represent the motions of the planets,

To try if this theory will account for the actual appearances,
it is necessary to determine, by means of terrestrial observa=-
tions, the magnitude and posltion of the curve in which a comet
moves round the sun.
