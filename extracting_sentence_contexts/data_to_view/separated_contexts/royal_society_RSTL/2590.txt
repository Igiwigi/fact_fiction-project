* "Theſe are the principal of Dr. 6MEL1N's thermometrical ob-
ſervations. He colle&ed many more, part-of which were de-
itroyed by fire or other accidents, and the remainder ſeem to
contain no further information. They were conſidered by him
s demonſtrating the cold of Siberia to exceed that even of the
Smoſt northern parts of Europe near 100 degrees, an opinion
which has fince been almoſt univerſally adopted ; whereas we
Shave, in fact, no proof that the difference of climate amounts
to ſo much as the variation between one winter and another,
At Yeniſeiſk, whetethe cold was ſo intenſe in 1735, it does not
Sſcem to have ever been ſufficient to freeze a thermometer in the
zwinter that M. 6MELIN ſpent there four years afterwards ; and
Z't will ſoon be ſhewn that quickſilver has congealed more than
once in Europe. All that we are authoriſed to conclude, therc-
fore, with reſped to! the Siberian climate, 1s, that the cold
there not unfrequently exceeds the degree indicated wr 392 of
a ſtandard mercurial thermometer.
