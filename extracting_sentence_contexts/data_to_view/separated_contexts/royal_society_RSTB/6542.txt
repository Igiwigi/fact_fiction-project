These anterior elements which meet in the middle line are hollow and
filled with clear crystalline calcite; in other words they are presumably perichondral
bone laid down round a coracoid cartilage. The whole arrangement is unique and
extraordinarily difficult to determine. The essential facts, however, are that the lateral-
fin spine is firmly clasped between two independent bones; the admedian spine is
inserted into a slot in one of these; and there is a third ventral element which

articulates with the other two. No supporting elements are to be seen in association
with any of the other paired fins. The specimen Powrie 1891, 92, 334 shows a series
of ceratotrichia associated with the pectoral fin.
