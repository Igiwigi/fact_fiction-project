(b) Woop-Osr method (1904).—This well-known method, involving copper reduction
like the Suarrer and Hartmann method, invariably gave results agreeing with those
obtained in the latter method, except in cases where traceable mistakes had been
made.

(c) Hivron and Macara method (1924).—The principle involved in this method is
the oxidation of the glucose by iodine in alkaline solution. It is a very simple method,
giving accurate results with pure glucose. However, in the presence of any substance
giving rise to iodoform in alkaline iodine solution, ¢.g., alcohol, acetaldehyde, acetone,
kojic acid, or any other substance absorbing iodine, values are obtained which are
sometimes far in excess of those obtained in the Suarrer and HarrmMann method.
This fact proved of considerable use in investigating the products of metabolism of
some of the fungi.

(3b) Carbon as carbon dioxide in solution.—The carbon present in the metabolism
solution as carbon dioxide, whether as the free gas or in combination as carbonates,
is estimated by the Van StyKe method, originally described for the estimation of
carbon dioxide in blood (1917). The method consists in removing the carbon dioxide
in vacuo, in a special apparatus designed by Van Styke, from the acidified liquid and
