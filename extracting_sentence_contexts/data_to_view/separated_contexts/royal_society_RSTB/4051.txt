genera* will follow the same rule as that of the species, so that, after a time, the family,
now supposed to contain three genera, may show such a distribution as the following :—

Of course, in actual fact, the dispersal will not be so simple. Even in one country,
the climate and other conditions will vary from place to place, so that the actual
distribution can very rarely be a circle or even an ellipse, unless just at the start in
such a flat country as Russia. As the forms spread, their dispersal will be altered by
geographical obstacles such as chains of mountains, arms of the sea, etc., and geological
changes will also affect it.
