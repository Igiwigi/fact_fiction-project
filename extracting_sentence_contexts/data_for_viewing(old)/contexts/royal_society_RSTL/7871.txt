It was necessary that the process to be employed should be precisely equivalent to
that used on the days of magnetic disturbance ; but there was advantage in changing
the form, For, where every individual disturbance was to be depicted, it was necessary
to measure every individual ordinate by two different scales; here, where the mean of

results for the s4me nominal hour on numerous days was to be used, it was better to
measure the ordinate (whether of the curve or of the zero formed by breaking connexions)
by one xcale (a scale of inches was in fact used); to take the means of all corresponding
to the same hour; and then to multiply the means by the two factors obtained from
the theory explained in the former paper. This being done for the two Galvanic
Curves, the results were combined in the way explained in the Å¿ormer paper to exhibit
the Inferred Northerly Force and the Inferred Westerly Force.

The general multiplier of the geometrical factors used in the former investigation was
determined tentatively, to satisfy this condition, that on the whole the magnitudes of the
8udden changes of the large ordinates of the curves representing Inferred Northerly Force
and Inferred Westerly Force should be sensibly equal to the similar magnitudes in the
curyes given by the Magnetometers, Considering it as proved that the great disturbances
are really produced by the galvanic currents, it is evident that we have thus a fairly
accurate scale for converting galyanic indications into magnetic forces (referred, as is
