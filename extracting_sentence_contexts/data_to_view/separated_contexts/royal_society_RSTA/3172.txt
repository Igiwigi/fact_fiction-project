For energies below 200keV, the charge of the projectile does play a role. As the proton
attracts the electron, while the antiproton repels it, the proton cross section becomes larger
than the antiproton cross section. In fact, while the proton cross section monotonically increases
with decreasing collision energy, the antiproton cross section levels out, and even declines
slightly, below collision energies of approximately 150 keV. Down to approximately 50 keV the
experimental results are well described by the distorted wave Born approximation. Below 30 keV there are no experimental data, so instead I compare the results from different
theoretical approaches.
