We now show that the hidden symmetries essentialize a ‘collapse’ of spatio-temporal scaling,
space-translation and Galilean symmetries of the original system, with important implications
for turbulence.

(a) Fusing of the spatio-temporal scaling

First, let us see how the hidden scaling symmetry (3.4)-(3.5) is linked to the space-time scaling
symmetries of the original system. The latter have the form (table 1)

t,x,u +> at,Ax, (2) u fora,A>0. (4.1)
One can check that, for any symmetry (4.1), the corresponding rescaled field U(X, t) transforms
according to the hidden scaling symmetry (3.4) with the same parameter 4 and independent of
a; see appendix A(d) for details. The fact that the temporal scaling with any a > 0 does not affect
the rescaled field U(X, t) implies that our dynamical rescaling projects the two-parameter family
of space-time symmetries (4.1) onto the one-parameter family of hidden scaling symmetries.

Relations (4.1) can be written in the form (1.1) for a =A In particular, the statistical self-
similarity of u(x,t) with any h (for example, = 1/3 in Kolmogorov 1941 theory) translates into
the hidden scaling symmetry for the rescaled solution U(X, t). Furthermore, since the hidden
symmetry does not depend on h, it is restored in solutions combining scale-invariant parts with
different exponents h. This property makes the hidden scaling symmetry compatible with the
multifractal framework of entangled scaling symmetries mentioned in Introduction: intermittent
solutions restore the hidden scale-invariance in the statistical sense for the rescaled fields U(X, r),
while all scaling symmetries (1.1) are broken in original variables. One can see this property as
a tradeoff: by loosing the information on exponents ht we restore the self-similarity. An explicit
