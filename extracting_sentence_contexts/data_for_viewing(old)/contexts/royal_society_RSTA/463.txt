2. Condition monitoring and structural health monitoring approaches
for wind turbines

In the Introduction, a major problem when trying to perform online SHM and CM for data-based
methods was mentioned: the influence of the varying conditions under which the wind turbines


operate. This means simply that one should account for the non-stationarity that is not related
to damage of the signals analysed, but this is definitely not a simple task. Vibration data coming
from wind turbine blades and gearboxes while in operation should be influenced by the varying
load and environmental conditions. Despite the fact that there has been significant research of
damage detection methods for such components, most of the studies are mainly performed in the
laboratory environment [3]. Basic signal processing techniques in this case might prove sufficient
to solve the damage detection problem, although, in general, this would not be true in real-world
damage detection scenarios.

Some of the most simple time-domain methods that have been used for condition monitoring are
time-invariant analysis methods, based on the estimation of statistical parameters. This is a group
of methods that uses univariate features. The principle of these methods is often to simply use
the overall vibration level to describe the general condition of the machine. Estimates used in this :
case are peak amplitude, peak-to-peak value, root mean square value of the signal, crest factor :=

and statistical moments such as variance, skewness and kurtosis [4,5]. More advanced techniques Sy
