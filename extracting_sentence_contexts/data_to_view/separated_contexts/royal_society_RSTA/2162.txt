modular forms, which we more precisely define below, transform like modular forms but with : Ed

be at play in Ramanujan’s asymptotic claim. In fact, we saw potential hints in the transformation Los

More precisely, we have the following definition of a quantum modular form, which we Dy
attribute to Zagier [19], noting that his original definition was slightly more restrictive. : 8

Definition 2.2. A quantum modular form of weight k € 32 is a function g : Q\S > C, for some
discrete subset S, such that for all y = (4 +) € I’, an appropriate subgroup of SL2(Z), the functions

satisfy a suitable property of continuity or analyticity in R.

(The multiplier systems ¢(y) which appear satisfy |e(y)| = 1, in accordance with the theory of
ordinary modular forms.)

To elaborate on this definition, in which the analytic property required to hold in R is left
intentionally a bit vague by Zagier, a typical example of a quantum modular form may be
(but is not necessarily required to be) such that the corresponding functions h, are defined on
Q\{y~!(ico)}, and extend to functions which are C®, or perhaps analytic in R\{y~!(ioe)}. Given
the nature of the modular action of SL2(Z), it does not quite make sense to define quantum
modular forms exactly analogously to ordinary modular forms with only a change in domain.
