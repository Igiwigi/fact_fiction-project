influence of granular and super-granular flows. If the coronal field lines remained anchored to the
same pair of footpoints over days or weeks, the coronal magnetic field would appear extremely
tangled and complex. The coronal field outlined in extreme ultraviolet (EUV) images shows
little sign of such tangling—in fact, it appears smooth enough to have been ‘combed’. While it
is still possible that complex tangling occurs at length scales below our present resolution [1],
footpoint motions occur over all length scales and presumably so should the tangling. There
is little evidence for it on the largest scales, which appear increasingly well fitted by potential
fields over time [2].
