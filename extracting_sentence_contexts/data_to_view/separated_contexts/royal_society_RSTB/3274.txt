The process then seems to be one of morpho-
logical conerescence or of physiological fusion of
impulses. It is possible that increase and decrease in number
of leaves at a node may take place by both kinds
of methods. But whichever theory be adopted the
facts indicate that a monocotylous embryo may
become dicotylous by the process equivalent to
chorisis, while a dicotylous one may become mono-
cotylous by the reverse process, without any anatomical evidence persisting in the
single cotyledon of any such phylogenetic change (21). The facts also demonstrate
that the number of leaves on an axis can decrease or increase on a stem without any
corresponding change in the number of original internodes, and that on the one
hand opposite phyllotaxis can give way to alternate by the “fusion method” or by
displacement, and in the latter case a new set of segments which are interealary in a
phylogenetic sense may arise. It has already been noted that when the phyllotaxis is cyclic in pees the increased
(or decreased) number of leaves at the nodes is continued, when once established, for
some distance along the stem, but that in this respect alternate and not successive
nodes are more closely correlated.
