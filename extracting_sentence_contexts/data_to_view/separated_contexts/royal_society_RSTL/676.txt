Here we perceive the variation of the temperature of the
air, following the course of the sun, pretty considerable
whilst it is above the horizon, and very insignificant during
the night; and this, I may remark, is a general fact at sea,
and one of the principal features of difference between the
temperature of the atmosphere over the land, and oyer the
ocean.

The law of the regular variation of temperature, is fre-
quently interrupted. Even in fine weather, when the air is
not in motion, it is subject to interruption. During a calm,
the variation of temperature is nearly the same as on land,
the maximum degree of heat not being at noon precisely,
but some time after, and for the same reason ; because there
is an accumulation of heat, and not only in the ship, but
actually in the water itself, as I may show by noticing the
temperature of the air and of the sea, during even a short
calm, hardly of 24, hours duration.
