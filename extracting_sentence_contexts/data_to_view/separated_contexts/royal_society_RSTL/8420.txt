There
can be no doubt that these branches here described are the rudiments of the branched
ovary possessed by lower Planarians, such as Dendrocelum lacteum. Tn Bipalium a
single one of the branches, the most anterior or terminal one, has become enlarged
and differentiated, and has taken on the whole of the ovarian duties: the remaining
branches are present in a rudimentary condition, like the yelk-glands: in Rhynchodemus
both diverticula and yelk-gland have disappeared. Our Land-Planarians are, in fact,
in their ovary just like Polycelis cornta, O. Schmidt (Dendroccelen Strudelwiirmer,
Taf. iii. fig. 1). The position of the oviduct, as seen in transverse vertical sections,
is of great importance: it is always in close relation with the main trunk of the
primitive vascular system, lying immediately above it or just within it in Ãž.
