The character
figures assigned by the co-operating stations are summed at de Bilt, as if they were
ordinary numerical quantities, and the final order assigned to the days in the scale of
disturbance is based on these sums (or their arithmetic means). If, for instance,

767” eo”
rid 2

or to each

30 stations send in results, and all assign character ‘‘ 2” to one particular day, while
half the stations assign “2,” and half assign “1” to a second day, the total character
sums obtained at de Bilt for the two days would be respectively 60 and 45, giving as
the mean estimates 2 and 1°5. The principles followed in assigning character figures at different stations vary, and
the fact that the scale of values is so narrow necessitates grouping together at any
one station days which differ widely in disturbance. It is also very difficult to
maintain even a roughly uniform standard throughout a series of years. One naturally
wishes to discriminate between the days of each year, and if one adopts a standard
which gives fairly similar numbers of days of characters “0,” “1,” and “2” in a highly
disturbed year, one has in a quiet year hardly any “2's,” and a wholly extravagant
number of “0's.” The natural consequence is a tendency to lower the standard for a
“1” ora “2” in a quiet year, and to raise it in a disturbed year.
