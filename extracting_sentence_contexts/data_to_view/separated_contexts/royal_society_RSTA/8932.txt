The Solar Diurnal Barometric Variation. As was remarked in § 6, the atmospheric motions to which the daily magnetic
variations are to be attributed, on the Srewart-Scuuster theory, are the horizontal
and not the vertical movements. Before proceeding with the study of the magnetic
variations, a brief statement will be made of the principal relevant facts regarding
the daily circulation and electrical conductivity of the atmosphere.
