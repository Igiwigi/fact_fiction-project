We should therefore
expect the work done by a corpuscle in passing through the surface layer of different
metals to be approximately equal to a constant divided by the cube root of the
atomic volume. Up to the present © has been determined only for sodium, platinum
and carbon, but fortunately these three elements furnish a considerable range of
atomic volume. As a matter of fact, carbon has the smallest atomic volume of all
elements, whilst that of sodium is only exceeded by the alkali metals of greater
atomic weight. In the accompanying table values of the atomic volume and the inverse of its cube
root are given in the first two columns. The third contains the surface discontinuity
in the potential 84, which is proportional to ®; whilst the numbers in the last
column are the ratios of those in the second and third.
