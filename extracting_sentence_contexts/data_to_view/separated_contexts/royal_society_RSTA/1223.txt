The modifications due to thermo-elastic effects are not of any
importance in problems concerning the vibrations of solids, though the integral term
may be important in the discussion of afterworking effects. As an approximation,
the stress-strain relations are taken in the simple form for isothermal changes, namely
(1-821). The equations of motion and the stress-strain relations for a visco-elastic
solid in this approximate form, differ from the corresponding equations for a perfectly
elastic solid only in the fact that the elastic constants ¢,,,,, are replaced by linear

Condition for the stability of equilibrium of the standard configuration.—It is a matter
of experience that a solid is in stable equilibrium in its standard configuration, as here
defined. As we are neglecting thermo-elastic effects, we put

Cg =0, up =0, 0 =O.
