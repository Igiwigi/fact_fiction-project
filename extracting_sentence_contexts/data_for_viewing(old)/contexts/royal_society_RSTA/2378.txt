Laboratory measurements use different methods in the different wavelength domains, so
individual publications usually cover only a restricted spectral band. A compilation of these
measurements was made by Warren [3], covering all wavelengths from the UV to the microwave
(wavelengths 40nm to 2m); it was superseded by a revised compilation by Warren & Brandt
[4] (hereafter WB08). Figure 1 shows this revised compilation, for ordinary hexagonal ice Th at
temperature 266 K (in fact this entire review will almost exclusively concern ice Ih).

(a) Absorption bands

There are several things to note in figure 1. The real index oscillates in the narrow range of
approximately 1-2, whereas the imaginary index varies by ten orders of magnitude. (In regions
of very strong absorption, where the mean free path of a photon is smaller than the wavelength,
Me can drop below 1.0, as at A < 70nm in the UV, and at A+ 3m. However, signal propagation
