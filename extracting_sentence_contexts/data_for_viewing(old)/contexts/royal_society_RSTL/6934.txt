12. But there is a case included indeed as a limiting one in the foregoing general
case, but which must be specially considered; viz. the two directrix lines 1 and 1' may
coincide, giving rise to a twofold directrix line. To show how this is, I return for the
moment to the case of the scroll $(1, 1, mz) with two distinct directrix lines 1 and 1',
and, to fix the ideas, I suppose that the directrix lines do not either of them meet the
curve 1, 80 that the order of the scroll is =2m. Through the line 1 imagine the series of
planes A,B, CC, ... meeting the line 1' in the points «, b', & ..; the generating lines through
the point «' are the lines in the plane A to the points in which this plane meets the
curve m; the generating lines through the point #' are the lines in the plane B to the
points where this plane meets the curve m.; and 80 for the generating lines through the
points &, d'... . And it is clear that the points &', 0', c\, .. correspond homographi-
cally with the planes A, B, C,.. . This gives immediately the construction for the
case where the two directrix lines come to coincide. In fact, on the twofold directrix
line 1=1' take the series of points a, 6, c.., and through the same line, corresponding
homographically to these points, the series of planes A, B, C,..; the generating
lines through the point @ are the lines through this point, in the plane A, to the
points in which this plane meets the curve m; and s0 for the entire series of points
b,c,.. of the line1=1/; the resulting scroll, which I will designate as the scroll S (1, 1, m),
remains of the order =2m. If there is given a point of the curye m, then the plane
through this point and the directrix line is the plane A; and the point &@ is then also
given by the homographic correspondence of the series of planes and points, and the
generating line through the given point on the curye mz is the line joining this point

-with the point a.
