away a little more rapidly than that of the oscillatory spark, but it is probable that
this ditference would be reduced by prolonging the time of exposure; since it is, of
course, the radiations of the shortest wave-length which are most absorbed by
different media.

What are the reasons for this similarity between the spectrum of the flame and
the spectrum of the oscillatory spark? Until we have conclusive evidence to the
contrary, we must assume that it is a question of temperature. On the one hand,
the increase in the number of lines of the flame spectrum obtained by the use of the
sprayer may be attributed to the fact that the hottest regions of the flame take part
in the production of the phenomena, and, on the other hand, the diminution in the
number of lines in the spark spectrum when the spark becomes oscillatory is due to a
diminution of its temperature. In fact, in the case of the ordinary spark, the
whole of the energy liberated in the secondary circuit of the induction coil by the

breaking of the current in the primary circuit is dissipated in a single rush ; whereas,
in the case of the oscillatory spark, the rate of dissipation is greatly reduced by the
conditions under which the discharge takes place. It is really the temperature at

the point at which the discharge current leaves the electrode and enters the air
which plays the most important part in the production of the spectrum, and not the
