In this case the operation was performed by removing a considerable portion
of the skull upon the left side; the left cerebral hemisphere was carefully retracted
so as to reveal the corpus callosum ; the posterior half of this structure was divided,
and the lateral ventricle opened, so as to expose the dorsal portion of the optic
thalamus and pulvinar. These were destroyed by the galvano-cautery. That this
was performed without any obvious implication of adjoining structures, such as the
internal capsule, optic radiations, or external geniculate body, is evident from the
examination of a section (Plate 2, fig. 6) made through the lesion.

The symptoms in the sphere of vision after this operation were as follows :â€”
blindness in the right eye and hemianopsia to the right side in the left eye. This
fact was detected by the usual tests and repeatedly confirmed. In addition to this,
there was anvsthesia and loss of the power of localising a clip all down the right side.

When again tested five days later, the right eye was no longer blind, but hemiopie,
so that there was now homonymous hemianopsia to the right side, with blunting of
sensibility and loss of the power of localising a clip down that side of the body.

It may be here mentioned that the temperature was taken in both groins, imme-
diately after the operation and on several subsequent occasions, without any increase
above normal being observed.

A month later the monkey remained in statu quo as regards vision, being absolutely
hemiopic to the right side, but the anesthesia and inability to localise a clip had
