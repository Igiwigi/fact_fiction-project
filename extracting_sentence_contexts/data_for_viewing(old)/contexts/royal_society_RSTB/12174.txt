that the signalling mechanisms between single-celled individ-

reminiscent of signalling mechanisms traditionally associated
with nerve cells, and that at least in the case of the slime ena like memory and decision making among others.

I would like to finish this section with some thoughts that

I expressed a few years ago about slime moulds and social 10. A proposal to expand the conceptual idea of
bacteria (from [3, pp. 152]):
