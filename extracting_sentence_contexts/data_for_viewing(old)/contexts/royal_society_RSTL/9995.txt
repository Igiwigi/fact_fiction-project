- Sixthly, a layer of granular material, which occupies the greater part of the
tubercle in the centre.

At the junction of this tubercle with the vagal tuberosities there are sections of a
few bundles of nerve fibres.

We have now to consider how the tuberculum impar of the Mormyrus may be
explained by a consideration of these facts,

The organ in question is, as we have seen, placed immediately behind the cerebellum,
and at firsb 8ight this seems to be the only circumstance that it has in common with
