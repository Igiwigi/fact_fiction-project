Now let us set up the example task. The system is asked: ‘What is the dollar of
Japan?’. The system’s knowledge base is assumed to include all necessary items, for example:
‘currency = superset*dollar’ and ‘Yen =Japan*currency’, i.e. it knows that the dollar is a subset
of the concept of a currency, that the currency of Japan is, in fact, the Yen and all other relevant
facts. Under these conditions a possible succession of steps used by the overall ‘cognitive’ system
to solve the query is shown in table 4. The system begins by loading the keywords of the query into its buffers INA and INB (step 1).
