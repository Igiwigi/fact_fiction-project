structure with the form of a spiral staircase were to split longitudinally along a line
passing through the middle of each step, the split halves would be in exactly the same
spatial relation to each other as are the halves of the prophase chromosome. The
situation may be optically demonstrated by a very simple experiment. If two pieces
of wire are wound on a stick so that they are parallel to each other, i.e. as if one wire
or the tape previously used had split longitudinally, it will be found that when the
stick is removed the two wires will be twisted together in such a way that it will be
impossible to pull them apart sideways for they will interlock at every turn. They can
only come apart if the coils are first unwound. This unwinding is a well-known feature
of prophase and has often been described (e.g. Koshy 1933; Sax and Sax 1935;
Darlington 1935; etc.). In Osmunda, as in other plants, it is almost though not quite
complete by metaphase; the lowest chromosome in fig. 46, Plate 17, still shows one
turn. The fact that untwisting is geometrically necessary before the half-chromosomes
can separate is clear evidence that the spiral shape of the unsplit chromosome must
be of the torsional type. The occurrence of untwisting in prophase does not, however,
in itself justify any deduction further than this, and the nature of the twist in the
definitive chromosome, i.e. whether constructional or unstable, can only be inferred
from other evidence.

Some other evidence is supplied by the behaviour of the spiral through the mitotic
cycle. The general features of the principal stages of mitosis are shown in figs. 1-9,
Plate 16, and details of the most important of them in figs. 23-28, Plate 17. At early
prophase the nucleus is still of the “‘solid’’ type (cf Manton 1935), i.e. it is an oval or
pear-shaped mass of ill-defined chromosome bodies, in which are embedded several
nucleoli (cf. fig. 2 for general view, fig. 23 for detail of chromosomes). At late prophase
