Te may not improbably be the case, however, that the well-marked ridge (dorsal ridge)

surprising that these structures should be so well developed when the diminutive nnd
yudimentary condition of the air-bladder is taken inte consideration. It mmat be
admitted, however, that our suggestion receives some support from the fact that in
the allied genus Glyptosternum, where a definitely recognisable dorsal lamina is
present, there is no trace of the dorsal ridge.

The post-Lemporal®* has its ascending process aud stem somewhat expanded, hut
the inferior limb (pt.i.) is an extrermnely slender process, which, after leaving the stem,
is firmly applied if not actually anchylosed to the distal extremity of the trmsyerse
process of the fourth vertebra, but nevertheless becomes detached therefrom as it
pssses inwards, and eventually fuses with the anterior end of the dorsal mdge on the
lateral surface of the basioccipital. The socket for the clavicle is in part formed hy a
deep groove in the post-temporal at the jnuetion of the stem with the inferior limb,
and in part by the distal extremity of the modified transverse process which converts
the groove into a tubular socket,
