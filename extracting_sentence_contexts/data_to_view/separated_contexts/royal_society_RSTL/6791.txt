There are two different forms,
according as the line is for the portion intermediate between the cuspidal points cru-
nodal and for the extramediate portions acnodal, or as it is for the intermediate portion
acnodal and for the extramediate portions crunodal. Cubic Seroll $(1, 1, 3).
33, Starting from the equation
(axx+pg)(yw—az)+(+Lz, yY=0,
then putting w—jz for w and zz for 2, this may be written
(aug) {yn— (ok py)} +(#De+y,y=0,
or, what is the same thing,
a(yw—a22)+(+Xx, y)'=0;
and then, if (#Ls, y=(s, B, y, 3, y)%, this may be written
w{y(w+Payy)—a(2—az)} +y*=0;
or changing the values of w and z, we have

a(yw—az)+,=0
for the equation of the scroll $(1, 1, 3)*,

* It is 80mewhat more convenient to change the sign of z, and take a(yw+z)+y*=0 as the canonical
form,

34, The Hessian of the form is a*, and it thus appears that the plane z=0 is a deter-
minate plane through the double line. But 4=0 is not a determinate plane; in fact,
- if for y we write y+ az, the equation is
—#2+aw(y+22)+(y+MxY=0,
that is,
—#(2=aw—3Ky—e)+ay(w+3r)+4*=0,

which, changing 2 and w, is still of the form a(yw—az)+5=0. The planes 2=0, w=0 will alter with the plane y=0, but they are not determined
even when the plane y=0 is determined; in fact we may, without altering the equa-
tion, change w, 2 into w+0y, 2+0x respectiyely,

- 35, In the equation a(yw—az)+y*=0, writing y=az, we find for the equations
of a generating line, y=az, 2=M+7. Considering the section by the plane
«r+By+y2+5w=0, we have
