appreciated with reference to quantum theory as that associated with de Broglie
waves. The canonical momentum for a quantum particle is Planck’s constant
divided by its de Broglie wavelength. More formally, the canonical momentum is
hat derived from the Lagrangian, which is constructed to satisfy the canonical
commutation relation

[x, p]=ih. (4.1)

For many applications, these momenta are one and the same, but in
electromagnetism they are quite distinct. The difference can be traced to the
fact that the electric and magnetic fields depend on the frame of reference.

The form of the canonical momentum depends, in fact, on the gauge
and the form of the matter—field coupling employed (Power 1964; Craig &
Thirunamachandran 1998). In the electric dipole form, most appropriate for our
systems, we find that for a single point dipole (Baxter et al. 1993; Leonhardt
2006; Hinds & Barnett 2009)

Pkinetic = Peanonical + 4 x B. (4.2)

This difference arises from the Réntgen interaction, which is a manifestation
of the electric field derived from a magnetic field in a moving frame of reference
(in this case, that of the dipole). More generally, for an object with electric dipole
