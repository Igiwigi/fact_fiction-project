E criterion does not exclude some series whose sums: are cor-
E rectly given, is a point which Ido not cngider yet completely
Z decided ; the difficulties to which the application of acknow-

E worthy. cf the attention of mathematicians. A more strict
z method might have been pursued in determining the sum of
S that part of the series which is neglected ; but this in general
'Z leads to such differential equations, as cannot afford us much
o assistance. I have, however, given one example of this
2 method, and I have shown that when the part which had been
z neglected, as being apparently equal to zero (but which is in
= fact a finite quantity,) is added to the sum furnished by the
E method of expanding horizontally and summing vertically, the true
V value of the series results, This confirms the explanation I
S have given of the reason of the apparent failure of that

a : It will be sufficient to point out the cause which leads to

error, and to determine the conditions on which its existence
depends for one only of the series; suitable modifications of .
the reasoning. will readily suggest themselves for the others.
I hall therefore, at present, consider the theorem (A). If
