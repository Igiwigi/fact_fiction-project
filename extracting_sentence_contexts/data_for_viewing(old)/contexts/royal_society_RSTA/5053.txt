Several investigations of the damage in glass surfaces due to quasi-static loading with hard â€œ3
spheres have been made since the late nineteenth century [1-10]. In these studies, the most : a
dominant aspect of the damage was the Hertzian cone cracking. Early studies of cone cracking ig
in inorganic glasses by impact with hard spheres were made by Raman [11], Benerji [12] and : s
Andrews [13]. Interestingly, all these authors [11-13] suggested confidently that the impact- : Ey

generated cone cracking was due to the shear stresses. However, this view is not now generally
held and it is widely accepted that cone cracking is due to the surface radial tensile stress at the
circle of contact between the sphere and the target, generated by the impact.

There are, however, relatively few in situ observations from impact loading of glass specimens
with spherical or pointed projectiles. The main reason for the paucity of such studies appears to be
due to the fact that the total contact time between a test glass surface and the impinging projectile, : =
12mm in diameter, is only about a couple of microseconds. Thus, in order to make in situ 3
observations of a small-particle impact on a glass surface and the ensuing damage in the latter, :
specialized high-speed photographic techniques and particle propulsion methods are required. nee)

Such high-speed photography techniques have been available in the Cavendish Laboratory, :
Cambridge, UK, since the 1950s when the laboratory obtained a Beckman and Whitley Model [4
189 rotating mirror high-speed framing camera (Beckman and Whitley Inc., Mountain View, CA, DN
USA) capable of recording images at up to approximately 2 million frames s~! (AD Yoffe 1985, =
personal communication). In the early 1970s, a particle propulsion system was designed and oo
constructed [14] in the laboratory, with which it became possible to make investigations of the .
impact response of a wide range of inorganic glasses [15-20] and ionic crystals [21].
