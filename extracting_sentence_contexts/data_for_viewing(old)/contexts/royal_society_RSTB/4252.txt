< The superficial differences between the pterygoids of the two types are all simply
B due to the extreme distinction of shape of their skulls, one a small-brained type with
q a very tropibasic skull, the other a very large-brained type with a platybasie skull.

7 From these resemblances I am driven to conclude that the pterygoid of mono-
; tremes, originally discovered by Gaupp, and which he has shown to be homologous
: with the mammalian pterygoid, is actually the homologue of the reptilian pterygoid.

3 If I understand his position rightly, Gaurr founds his objection to recognising in
H the mammalian pterygoid the true descendant of that of reptiles on the following
: two facts :—

¢ * 1. That the reptilian pterygoid is developed in connection with the pars palatina
3 of the palato-quadrate cartilage, whilst the mammalian pterygoid constantly lies on

the base of the neural skull.

2. That if the mammalian pterygoid is really homologous with the reptilian
pterygoid, then it is necessary to find a new homology for the Echidna pterygoid.
