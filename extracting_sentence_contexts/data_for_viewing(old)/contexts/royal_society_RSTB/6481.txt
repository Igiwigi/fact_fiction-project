It has been shown in this account of the nervous system of Marthasterias glacialis
that the motor fibrillae are not restricted to the hyponeural system (Lange’s nerve)
and the apical nerve. ‘The latter represents, in fact, a condensation of the fibrillae
of the lateral motor nerve, which condensation is associated with the innervation of
the apical longitudinal muscle. In the same way, Lange’s nerve must be regarded

as a local centre serving for the innervation of the inferior transverse muscle. The
motor nervous system of Marthasterias glacialis, as far as it can be traced, is, in fact,
developed where it is most required, 7.e., in the neighbourhood of the muscles of the
arm and disk. Comparison of the motor systems should be made with this fact in
mind, and not merely by reference to the hyponeural and apical systems which,
from the evidence provided by the study of Marthasterias glacialis, are only parts of
a generally distributed neurofibrillar plexus.

The hyponeural system is, on this account, best developed in the ophiuroid where
it undertakes the innervation of the four intervertebral muscles responsible for the
lateral and oro-aboral flexure of the arm. In the Holothuroidea it is precisely this
centre of innervation which supplies fibrillae to the circular and longitudinal
musculature of the body wall. In the crinoids the hyponeural nerve is both sensory
and motor, its motor fibrils serving for the innervation of the muscles of the wall
of the water vascular vessels, while in the asteroid, where it is purely motor, the
hyponeural radial nerve supplies branches to the inferior transverse muscle. Only
