tends to surround the whole disKk with its mouth or growing margin, and thencefor-
ward the growth is cyclical, as in Cycloclypeus and Orbitolites.

Concluding Remarks.

117. Looking now to the general organization of the five genera which I have
described, and to the peculiarities by which I have shown that each is characterized,
I think that we are in a position to inquire into the value of the system of classifica-
tion which has been erected by M. p'OrxB1Gxy on the exclusive basis of plan of
growth; on which inquiry, the facts which I have now brought together have an
obvious and direct bearing.

I. The very close physiological relationship which has been shown to exist between
Orbitolites and Orbiculina, requires that they should be associated in the same Family,
if not in the sxame Genus. In the classification of M. v'Orpicxy they are ranked under
different Orders (Cyclostegues and Helicostegues).

II. In like manner, the close pbysiological relationship which has been shown to
exist between Cycloclypeus and Heterostegina requires that they should be associated
in the same Family, if not in the same Genus. In the classification of M. p'OrBrany
they would be ranked under different Orders (Cyclostegues and Entomostegues).
