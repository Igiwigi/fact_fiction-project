e suddenly acquired a strong negative electrification.

A This result appeared to be consistent with the view that, after the stimulation of
the residual gas by the induction coil discharge, there resided upon the inner surface
of the bulb a layer of positively electrified gas particles which, through the action of
the magnetic field, had been removed. On the other hand, such an inrush of positive
ions from the inner surface of the bulb towards the denser portion of the magnetic
field, did not appear to support the idea that the luminous ring was negatively
electrified, nor could it account for the direction of rotation of the ring as determined
by the mica vane. That the actual luminosity of the ring was mainly due, however,
to the incoming radial streams of positive ions was probable from the fact that when
a positively electrified body was brought into contact with the glass of the bulb, a
faintly luminous ring in the interior was greatly brightened. A pause sometimes

occurred between the magnetisation of the electrodes, and the appearance of a
luminous ring. But in such a case positive electrification of the outer surface of the
bulb immediately caused the ring to appear within. Under these circumstances the
evidence that the luminosity was due to the radial streams of positive ions was also
