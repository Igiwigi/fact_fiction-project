This is the core of quantum theory, which is therefore determined by the non-commutativity
of the algebra. The Planck constant f is the dimensional constant on the right-hand side of


the commutator: it determines the amount of non-commutativity, hence discreteness, hence
impossibility of sharpness of all variables.

The non-commutativity between variables is Heisenberg breakthrough, understood and
formalized by Born and Jordan, who were the first to write the celebrated relation [q, p] = ih and
to recognize this non-commutativity as the key of the new theory, in 1925.

The non-commutativity of the algebra of the variables (measured by ft) is the mathematical
expression of the physical fact that variables cannot be simultaneously sharp, hence there is an
(i-size) minimal volume attainable in phase space, hence predictions are probabilistic.

The fact that values of variables can be predicted only probabilistically raises the key
interpretational question of QM: when and how is a probabilistic prediction resolved into an
actual value?

(c) The relational aspect of quantum theory 73

When and how a probabilistic prediction about the value of a variable a of a physical system S is 1
resolved into an actual value? : gS
The answer is: when S interacts with another physical system Sâ€™. Value actualization happens Saori
at interactions because variables represent the ways systems affect one another. Any interaction 1S
