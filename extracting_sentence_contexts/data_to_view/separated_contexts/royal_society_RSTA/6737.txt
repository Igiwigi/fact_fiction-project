the two solutions have different asymptotic values and are therefore distinct. Since

EQUATIONS OF SIMPLE BIRTH AND DEATH PROCESSES 363
For example, we can take a=5, b6=2, c=1;
a simple process with these parameters is given by
A, = w(nb+-2n4), fy = fe. We summarize these results in

Turorem 10, If the parameters of an analytical process in which Ay ~ 0, satisfy the conditions
(3°77) then the matrices F(t) and G(t) are distinct and in fact have the following properties:

Since all the rows of (3-74) or of (3-75) are identical, the solution G(¢) (if it exists) has the
“ergodic property’ (see p. 344) because the asymptotic distribution does not depend on the
initial distribution. On the other hand, if ¢<1, /(é) is not ergodic since the rows of (3-73)
are then distinct; in these circumstances, if the system remains finite at all, it can only tend
to the state of complete annihilation.
