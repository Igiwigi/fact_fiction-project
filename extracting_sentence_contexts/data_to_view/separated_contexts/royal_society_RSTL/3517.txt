Tartrate of Potash-and-soda. (Papers Nos. 573, 574.),â€”Of all
the salts I haye examined, this presents, perhaps, the most singular peculiarities.

* By a linear spectrum I understand such a one as would be cast by a fixed tar or other Juminary of in-

30 SIR J,. F, W. HERSCHEL ON THE CHEMICAL ACTION OF THE

The quality of its papers howeyer varies much with the doses of the ingredients, and,
in fact, I have never succeeded in hitting again that precise proportion of the argentine
and saline solutions which afforded the results I am about to state; and but that
every portion of a pretty large sheet of paper agreed in giving the same, and that I
have some of them now before me, I should hesitate to do 80. The preparation of
this particular specimen of paper, (marked 573-574 in my list of papers put on trial,)
was, 1st, nitrate of silver S. G. 1'132 ; 2nd, saturated solution of Rochelle salt ; 3rdly,
nitrate of silver 1132, which proving but little sensitive, a third wash of the nitrate
was added, by which its sensibility was materially increased, its other qualities re-
maining unaffected.
