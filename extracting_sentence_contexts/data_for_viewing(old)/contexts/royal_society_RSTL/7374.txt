PART VI.—CONSIDERATIONS ON THE NATURE OF THE CHEMICAL ELEMENTS,

112. The proof given in the preceding that DuLonG and PgTiT's law is not uniyer-
sally yalid, justifies certain conclusions, in reference to the nature of the 80-called
chemical elements, which may here be developed.

What bodies are to be regarded as chemical elements? Does the mere fact of inde-
composability determine this? or may a body be indecomposable in point, of fact and yet
from reasons of analogy be regarded not as an element but as a compound ? The history
of chemistry furnishes numerous examples of cases in which sometimes one and s80me-

& times another mode of view led to results which at present are regarded as accurate.
S The earths were in 1789 indecomposable in point of fact, when LavoisleR expressed the
©» opinion that they were compounds, oxides of unknown metals. LavoisgR's argumenta-
En was based on the fact that the earths enter as bases into salts, and that it was to be
S assumed in regard to all salts, that they contained an oxygen acid and an oxygen base.
But the view, founded on the same basis, that common salt contains oxygen, and the
Zzubsequent view that what is now called chlorine contained a further quantity of
Soxygen besides the elements of an oxygen acid, did not find an equally permanent recog-
"Znition, On the basis of the actual indecomposability of chlorine, Davy maintained
