Explanation of the New Sinqularities. Article Nos. 13 to 39.

I proceed to the explanation of the new singularities.

13. The cnicnode, or singularity C=1, is an ordinary conical point ; instead of the
tangent plane we have a proper quadricone.

14. The cnictrope, or reciprocal singularity C'=1, is als a well known one; it is in
fact the conic of plane contact, or say rather the plane of conic contact, viz. the cnictrope
is a plane touching a surface, not at a single point, but along a conic.

15. Consider a surface having the cnicnode C=1, and the reciprocal snrface having
the cnictrope C'=1. There are on the quadricone of the cnicnode ix directions of
closest, contact *, and reciprocal thereto we have six tangents of the cnictrope conic,
touching it at six points. The plane of the cnictrope meets the surface in the conic
twice, and in a residual curye which touches the conic at each of the six points. It
would appear that these six contacts are part of the notion of the cnictrope.

16. We may of course haye a surface with a conic of plane contact, but such that the
residual curye of intersection in the plane of the conic does not touch the conic six times
or at all; for instance the general equation of a surface with a conic of Plane contact is
