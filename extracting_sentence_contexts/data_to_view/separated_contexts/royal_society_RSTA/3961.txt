As said above, in the non-reactive cases, fingers extend on average the same distance above
and below the initial contact line between the two solutions of different composition and hence
different density. On the contrary, as seen in figure 5, all reactive equivalents feature asymmetric
fingers extending only towards the top. This is related to the fact that the acid-base reaction
consumes the acid A and the base B reactants to produce in the intermediate reaction zone
the salt product C of different density. This breaks the symmetry of the underlying density
profile, inducing a preferential direction growth of the fingers [33,34,40,43,44]. In this acid-base
experiment, fingers extend towards the top.
