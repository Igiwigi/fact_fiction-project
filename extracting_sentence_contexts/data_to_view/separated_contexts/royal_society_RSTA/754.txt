The sample space W is limited to the first quadrant of the plane of the xâ€™s, and its
positive part, W,, (0,), corresponding to any fixed value of 6,, is formed by a triangle
as suggested in fig. 4. In order to see at once the difficulties introduced by the fact that the probability
law (70) depends upon two parameters, while we are interested in one only, let us
try to solve the problem of confidence intervals by a guess. In Example I, the more
