The outline of the body will be understood by a reference to the figures. When
the second maxille are in the centre of the field of view, as in fig. 21, the outline is
pear-shaped, with the broad end of the pear at the posterior end of the body ; but
when the metastoma is in the centre this is reversed, and the broad end is in front. This difference is due to the fact that the dorsal region is much wider than the labrum
and series of buds, which together form a ridge along the ventral surface. In a dorsal view the simple eye (Oc) is seen as a black spot on the middle line, near
the anterior end of the body. It did not show any traces of a division into halves at
any stage of development which was observed.
