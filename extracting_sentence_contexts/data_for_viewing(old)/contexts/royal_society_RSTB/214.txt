500 PROFESSOR H. G. SEELEY ON THE STRUCTURE,

That specimen I regard us indicating a new genus, because the form of the hume
is distinctive, and, instead of being longer than the radius, as in other known Anom
donts, it is relatively shorter. It may be referred to as Hurycarpus Oweni. â€˜
number of digits is variable in other orders of Reptilia; and therefore the question
must remain open whether Dicynodonts had four or five.

If the first metacarpal is present, only its proximal end is exposed in near union
with the radiale : a circular osseous point in advance of it might then indicate its
distal end ; while a somewhat larger circle prolonging the line inward would indicate
the first phalange. These identifications, however, rest upon too shadowy a foundatio
of fact to be evidence that the digit existed.

The remaining digits are remarkable for showing a reduced number of phalanges,
There sre, apparently, three in the middle digit on the radial side, but only two in
each of the other digits, as in terrestrial Chelonians. I number the digits 2, 3, 4,5. The
metacarpal of digit JI. has a dice-box form, with large extremities. It is 8 to 9 millims,
long, 5 millims. wide proximally, and slightly wider distally. The third metacarpal is
of similar form, about 7 millims. long ; and the fourth is rather shorter, but its extremitie
are worn. The articular extremities appear to be more convex on the under side than
on the upper side, and the proximal end is usually rather larger than the distal end.

The first phalange of digit II. is much stronger than the corresponding bones in th
other digits, which decrease in size towards the ulnar side. All the bones appear ta
