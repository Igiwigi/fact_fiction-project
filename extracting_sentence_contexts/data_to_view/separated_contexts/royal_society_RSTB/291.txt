The longer this sustentacular
portion becomes, the more the upper end of the hyoid bar will appear removed from

e neighbourhood of the quadrato-mandibular and hyomandibulo-mandibular articu-
tions; the ligaments which in previous types connected the hyoid with the first
arch will gradually be given up, and a stage will be reached in which, as in Torpedo,
¢ the hyoid appears attached to the hyomandibula half-way between the masticatory
joint and the cranium. In a further stage the cranial or upper portion of the
hyomandibula will be still less developed, and the hyoid almost touches the cranium. GEGENBAUR mentions these important facts (‘Kopfskelet,’ p. 173): “The separation of
the hyoid from the hyomandibula is completed in the other Rays (except in Torpedo). 5 The hyomandibula there retains only its relation to the mandible; it becomes the

earer of the jaw-apparatus, whilst the hyoid henceforth behaves as the branchial
rehes. It is, in this case, either still attached to the cranium, as in Rhyncobatus,
Bs Trygon, and Myliobates, or it has become free, as in Raja.
