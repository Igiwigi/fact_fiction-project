In the last section we have found the velocity potential for flow against a semi-infinite
flat plate aerofoil with plan z’Ox (figure 13) at incidence. Using the same analogy as in
Part I this can be treated as the superposition of a plane wave, giving the two-dimensional
value for the pressure and other quantities over the aerofoil, together with a circular, or more
properly cone, wave C, say, spreading from the corner O. From the results of the previous
section it is easily deduced that the velocity potential of this cone wave is, in fact;

C,=- ae Ese ") JQ 30) /(o+atan 7] " (42)

1-++atant. (1+atan7)

The ‘trapezoidal problem’ of flow against the plate with plan z’00'z” will be satisfactorily
solved by superposing the plane wave, confined to its area, together with the two cone
waves C;, Cj, until these cone waves run off the aerofoil edges at A’A respectively. Behind
these points, although our solution still satisfies the differential equation, and 0¢/dy has the
correct value over the aerofoil the solution is invalid on account of the discontinuity in ¢
which appears over the triangular areas of which M4A’Z" is typical. The validity of the
solution is restored by superposing two further waves, in this case no longer of the ‘cone-field’
