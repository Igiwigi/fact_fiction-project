modifications restricted during both fasting [31] and consump-
tion of high-fat diets [17]. When an animal is consuming a
low-fat diet, especially if rich in carbohydrates, de novo
synthesis of fatty acids typically occurs. In contrast to the

litter and bacteria; [45,46]) fat content. Leaves and roots


showed the lowest diet quality based on Collembola biomass
(see the electronic supplementary material, figure S1), and
correspondingly performed the worst in quantitative diet
estimation, with root diets obfuscating the results. In summary,
the fact that the calculated CC sets did not meet their purpose
as species-specific but general-use CCs in the present study
necessitates further controlled feeding trials, taking further fac-
tors such as fat content of resources or consumer physiology
into account.

(c) Comparability to other quantitative fatty acid

signature analysis studies and future research
Knowledge of fatty acid metabolism is a prerequisite for the
use of QFASA [40]. Therefore, it is not surprising that the
major field of application is in polar vertebrates, higher
level predators in food chains characterized by the transfer
