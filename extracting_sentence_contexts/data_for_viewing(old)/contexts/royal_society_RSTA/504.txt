spacecraft [113] and structure functions from non-tetrahedral Cluster formations [110]. Those
studies used the ‘local mean field’, that is, the mean magnetic field is measured over the envelope
of the wavelet or structure function that is used to measure the fluctuations. This provides a
scale-dependent mean magnetic field that allows many different angles to the mean field to
be measured so long as a sufficiently long interval of stationary solar wind is processed. The
results of these studies show that power anisotropy decreases (i.e. the fluctuations become
less transverse, relative to the local mean field) [75,114], whereas the spectral index anisotropy
increases in the dissipation range [110]. These analyses also support the idea that dissipation
range fluctuations are dominated by KAWs.

Recent observations have motivated intensive research into electron scale turbulence both
theoretically and numerically [120-127]. However, the underlying physics remains controversial
primarily owing to the fact that the available observations are few and theoretical and numerical
work has been extended to those small scales only recently. One issue concerns the scaling of
the magnetic energy spectra down to and below pe. Sahraoui et al. [75] first reported a power-law
cascade f<2* down to fp,, where a clear spectral break is observed, followed by another power law
close to f;:* (fp, is the frequency in the spacecraft frame corresponding to the electron gyroscale
when the Taylor frozen-in flow assumption is used). This has been confirmed in a survey of
10 years of STAFF waveform data in the free-streaming solar wind [128]. On the other hand,
Alexandrova et al. [112,115], using STAFF-Spectrum Analyser (STAFF-SA) data, have reported
exponential scaling in the scale range kpe ~ [0.03, 3].

Another controversy concerns the nature of the plasma modes that carry the turbulence
cascade down to electron scales. Two main channels have been discussed: KAW [33,75,129,130
and the whistler turbulence [125]. There is growing evidence, as discussed above, that the
