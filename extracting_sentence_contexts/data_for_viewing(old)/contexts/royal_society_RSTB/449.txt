CoNCLUSIONS.

As the foregoing paper is but a collection of detailed facts: we can only offer as
conclusions a few bare statements.

1. The fibres of the excitable portion of the internal capsule are arranged from
before back, in the same order as the foci of representation in the excitable part of
the cortex, taken along lines drawn at right angles to the direction of the fissure of
RoLANpo.
