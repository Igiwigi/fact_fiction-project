418 ARIENS KAPPERS ON SOME. CORRELATIONS BETWEEN SKULL AND BRAIN.

Dealing with the nearest relative of man, the Chimpanzee, I may call to mind that there
are only two constant sagittal sulci on the frontal lobe (indicated in Plate 48).

With few exceptions these sulci are called the first or superior and second or inferior
frontal (KUKENTHAL and ZIEHEN, 1895). While the homologisation of the first frontal
sulcus in anthropoids with the human superior frontal is correct, the statement of various
authors (KUKENTHAL and ZIEHEN loc. cit.), BoLK (1901, 1909) and recently MInGAzzINI
(1928, pp. 210-11), that the second frontal sulcus of apes is the homologue of the human
inferior frontal, is wrong, as appears from the following facts.

If we compare the endocranial cast of the Pithecanthropus of Dusois with the
Chimpanzee brain (see Plate 48), there seems to be little doubt that the two frontal
fissures (11 and 7), go distinct in the Chimpanzee, also occur in the Pithecanthropus cast,
which, also in other details of its frontal fissuration, has distinctly chimpanzoid
features*, e.g. in the transverse fissures between 7 and 11, the relation of the fronto-
marginal 9 to 7 and of the fronto-orbital or sub-frontal sulcus (1). Even the small
independent dimple 8 (a very frequent feature even in man) is nearly identical in both.

Moreover, it appears that in Pithecanthropus underneath 7 another fissure (4) occurs
which runs in an archlike way. On the left hemisphere of Pithecanthropus it runs
somewhat steeper still, its course resembling more the relation of fissure 4? in my
