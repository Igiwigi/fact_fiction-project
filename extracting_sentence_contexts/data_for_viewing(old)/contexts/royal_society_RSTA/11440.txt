T am indebted to the memoir of M. Ranon* for the details of all the individuals
that are classed under this heading. I presume that in measuring the tibia he has
not included the spine, as his formule are, like mine, based on its exclusion. I have
further allowed for the fact that he used the oblique length of femur, while I require
the maximum length. Unfortunately we have only five cases to base our estimate
upon.
