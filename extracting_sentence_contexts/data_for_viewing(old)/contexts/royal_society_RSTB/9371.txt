is that the lesion persists and is present in all subsequent exper-
iments on the particular monkey. An additional disadvantage
is the time it may take for the lesion effect to develop and so, in
principle, some recovery of function could occur before the
injection effect is measured.

Injection of neuro-active chemicals to produce a lesion
addresses the problems of the interaction between lesion def-
icit and its recovery by measuring behaviour before there is
time for recovery. The injections are small, usually done
with a microliter syringe, and can be made on one day and
the behavioural effect tested on the next day. The day wait
follows from the fact that the neuro-active chemicals are kill-
ing neurons, and their effect is usually not instantaneous.
Waiting until the process is closer to being complete avoids
studying behaviour when there might be transient activity,
such as a hyperactivity preceding neuron death. In addition
to behavioural measurement soon after the lesion, a signifi-
cant advantage of the chemical lesion over the surgical or
electrolytic ones, is that the injection can be precisely directed
by first locating the target area with neuronal recording. The
precision can be increased further by verifying the location of
the injection by concurrent recording from an electrode
attached to the injection syringe [20]. Finally, the chemical
lesions leave a record of their location for future histology.
