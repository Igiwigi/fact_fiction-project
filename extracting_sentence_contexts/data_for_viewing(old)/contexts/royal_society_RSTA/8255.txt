mination was not possible. To establish the value of this work (given in Part III) an
investigation was undertaken to determine, firstly, how closely the flow mapped out in
the electrical tank resembled the flow of an inviscid fluid, especially in the region of the
stagnation point, and, secondly, whether it was possible to estimate from the flow pattern
the pressure distribution around the surface. This investigation will now be described.

AN ELLIPTIC CYLINDER AND AN AEROFOIL OF INFINITE SPAN, ETC. LL

(14) The method of the electrical tank depends on the fact that the stream-lines for
an inviscid flow and the equi-potential lines in an electrical field are identical when the
boundary conditions correspond. Apart from minor modifications introduced to improve
the accuracy of measurement, the general scheme followed in the present experiments
was the same as that described in the paper by L. W. Bryant and D. H. Wiitiams.*
Two sets of diagrams were taken, first that of the stream-lines without circulation, and
second that of the stream-lines for circulation alone. The flow pattern with circulation
was obtained by the superposition of the two diagrams.

The experiments were made on the elliptic cylinder used in Part I, a form for which
the solution of the equation y?) =0 is known. The flow pattern was measured in the
tank with the cylinder at an incidence of 10° and for an assumed circulation of 0-7.
To allow a rigid comparison with the theoretical flow pattern for an infinite stream,
