Fig. 8.—The liquidus curve of the system copper-aluminium. As one of us has shown,* there is considerable evidence that aluminium is univalent
in the crystal of the element, and we suggest that this very small depression of freezing
point is due to the fact that the aluminium in the molten alloy is also univalent. There
is, however, considerable evidence (see p. 37) that the aluminium is trivalent in solid
solution in copper. If this be so, we have a case involving an equilibrium between
different states of the same atom, and a simple relation is not to be expected.
