never taken a single one over 60 mm. in this portion of the ocean.

During the initial period of our investigations, in the eastern Atlantic and the
Mediterranean, we had no occasion to concern ourselves with the American eel
(Anguilla rostrata) and its larve. Later on, however, circumstances changed, after
it was found that our researches in connection with the European species would have
to be extended farther west. The collections here made by the trading vessels, and
by the “ Margrethe” in 1913, brought us already certain specimens which, though
outwardly indistinguishable from Leptocephalus brevirostris, proved, on being tested
for number of muscle-segments (myomeres), to belong to the American eel, These
larvee were taken in the same area as those of the European species, even, indeed, at
one or two of the “ Margrethe’s” stations, in the same haul. It was with mingled
feelings that we noted this fact, since it involved a further complication of the eel
question, which at this point seemed more intricate than ever. Technically, also, it
increased the difficulty of our investigations, since the only means whereby the larva
of the two species can be distinguished one from the other is by counting, under the
microscope, the 104120 myomeres in each individual specimen—a very lengthy and
laborious business, especially on board a small vessel at sea.

After the cruise of the “ Dana,” in 1920, I look upon the matter in quite a different
way. True, the technical difficulties have not diminished—I have in mind the
counting of myomeres in the 7000 specimens obtained on the cruise—but the
comparison of the life-history of the two species which our investigations have
enabled us to make is, to my thinking, one of the most interesting chapters in the
history of the eel. Indeed, it is hardly too much to say that the life-history of the
