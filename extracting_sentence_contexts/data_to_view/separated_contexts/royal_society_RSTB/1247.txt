I do not, wish to make more of this than the facts warrant,
drawing is a faithful representation of what was seen in this exceptional case,
a matter for remark that these sporangia of Lycopodium, though they are of
siderable size, have no vascular supply; in the whole genus this one case is th
trace I have seen of any extension of the vascular system in the direction :

sporangium. . Tangential sections show that the number of archesporial cells is large;
fig. 76, which is at a phase of development intermediate between those of figs, 62
64 of L. clavatum, shows very beautifully that the number of these is twelve, —

it becomes more irregular with age (fig. 77), the cells of this sterile tissue for
their way upwards into the sporogenous tissue, and occasionally forming multie
processes. The development of it, however, is not carried to so great an extent as
been already noted in L. clavatum. :

Beyond the facts now described, the structure of the sporangium of L, alj
ealls for no further remark; it is obviously similar, in its main aspects, to
L. clavatum, notwithstanding the rather marked difference of external appe
the two species. Abortive sporangia are commonly found in this species, both at the upper and ;
limits of the strobilus; they show, perhaps better than in any other species,
gradual steps of transition from the fully mature to the completely abortive condi

SELAGINELLA. In the species of Selaginella which have been examined similar abortive spor
are found at the base of the strobilus ; the larger the number of examples of thi
are disclosed, the more important does it become that some adequate explan
of the phenomenon should be given. (See below, p. 535.)

Turning to the development of the normal sporangia in Selaginella, the most ‘
account hitherto given is that by Gorse (‘ Bot.
