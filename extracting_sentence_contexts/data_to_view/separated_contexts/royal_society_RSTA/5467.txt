The choice of the
threshold in the in vivo experiment was made consciously and in line with current neuroscience
literature, where the threshold is often imposed arbitrarily in order to ease physiological
interpretation of the results which survive it. In general, it is important to point out that statistics
for guiding acceptance/rejection of a link can be easily added to our method either through
surrogate data generation and analysis [67,68], or possibly through analytical definition of e.g.
a p-value for the estimated causality strength [1]. Also, situations can arise where separability (i.e. the fact that information in the causative
signal is independently unique and can therefore be removed by eliminating that signal from
the model) is not guaranteed. In such cases, general assumptions underlying any GC framework
will not be met, and in the presence of weak coupling this can lead to erroneous GC estimation. In such cases, convergent cross mapping approaches [69] can provide a valid alternative.
