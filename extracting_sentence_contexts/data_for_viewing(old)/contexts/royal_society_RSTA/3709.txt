Figure 3. Plot of the critical values of (a) ye versus o,, at varying ary; (6) ker versus cz, at varying ovy; (c) Yer versus ay at
varying a,,; (d) ke versus oty at varying c,,. The arrows indicate the direction in which the parameters ary (a,b) and ox,, (c,d)
grow from 0.6 to 2 in steps of 0.2.

figure 1a becomes infinitely soft. The critical wavelength is always of the same order as the body
thickness, and is more influenced by the parameter qj, if w,, > 1, as we can note from figure 3b,d.

The case in which ap = 1 is of particular interest in the applications because it is reproducible
in experiments using hydrogels. In fact, these soft materials are mainly composed of water, thus
