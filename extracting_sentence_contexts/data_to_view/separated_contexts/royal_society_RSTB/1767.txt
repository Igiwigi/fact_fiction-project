Such are, for instance, isobars, isotherms, &c., where all the
places, at the same level of the scale, are connected by a line, and furnish an example how the repre-
sentation of a third dimension becomes possible in statistical diagrams. Such drawings ought to be
classed amongst the “cartograms,” whose basis is supplied by a geographical map. Perrozzo has
adopted this system also for the representation of demographical facts, withont any relation to
their topographical distribution, that is, without referring to a geographical substratum. We arrive
thus, as in the hypsometric maps, at lines of equal height. But such representations do not satisfy

the fundamental requirement of statistical diagrams, that is, to show the change of the facts to the eye
directly, in an immediate way, without appealing to a mental process, for instance, to the view of
figures, This is not the case with isohypsos; one line is like the other, and thus we do not know by
immediate sight, but only by inqniry of the figures, which height we have before the eye.
