of lead sulphate falls only from about 700 A for the pure crystal to 200 A for the
complex containing 10%, of dextrine by weight. In view of what has already been
said, this must mean that the intercalations of dextrine are many times thicker than
a single glycopyranose chain.

There is, however, another factor which may modify this result, but it is difficult
to say how far it is effective. It has already been pointed out that since the complex
crystals are not random aggregates the elementary crystallites may to some extent
reinforce each other’s diffractions, so that the line broadening is less than if they were
altogether at random. The values given must be taken as superior limits to the actual
particle-size. Now, although an exact discussion is not possible, it is to be expected
that this effect will become less as more colloid is introduced. When 10°, is present,
and the microscope in fact shows only irregular masses with fluctuating extinction,
the phase relation of adjacent crystallites is probably too inexact to reduce the
broadening seriously. Ifwe accept the result for the complex of azide containing 10°,
of dextrine as an approximate measure of the actual size, we find the average width
of the crystallite is more than 20 times that required for all the dextrine to be present
between the surfaces in a single layer. On the other hand, if the crystallites are

smaller than this, and are exactly reinforcing each other’s diffractions, such a degree
of co-ordination can result only from their being parts of larger, branched, parallel
aggregates.

Between the results for the azide and for the sulphate there is an interesting
difference. In the former case there is, of course, a decrease when dextrine is intro-
