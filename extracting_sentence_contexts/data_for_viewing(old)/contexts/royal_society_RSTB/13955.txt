of spacers targeting vectors of ABR had a striking effect on
reducing the predicted count of ABR genes. Particularly com-
pared with the weaker association between the count of
spacers targeting vectors without ABR and ABR genes, this

We found that looking both across and within species,
CRISPR-Cas system presence was associated with a reduction
in counts of ABR genes. In addition, where spacers targeted
MGEs that carry ABR, a concurrent reduction in ABR genes
was seen. These results have promising implications for the
delivery of novel technologies to combat ABR such as
phage therapy and CRISPR-Cas antimicrobials, which rely
on bypassing bacterial immune systems to kill cells. In fact,
they may be ideal for this purpose, if the most multidrug-
resistant strains are also the most immunocompromised.
