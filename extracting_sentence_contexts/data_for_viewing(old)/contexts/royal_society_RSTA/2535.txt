but the cubic phases of CsPbI3 and SrTiO3 have positive thermal expansion.

Now we consider the case of CuO, which is one of the simplest materials showing NTE
[47,48]. The crystal structure of this material can be described in various ways. One way is to
describe it a face-centred cubic arrangement of copper atoms with an interpenetrating body-
centred cubic arrangement of oxygen atoms displaced by 1/4 of the way along the cubic unit
cell diagonal. Another way is to consider it as two interpenetrating cristobalite arrangements
of OCuy tetrahedra. This latter view gives the idea that there may be RUMs involving these


tetrahedra, and if so they may be associated with the mechanism for NTE. However, our ab initio
lattice dynamics calculations [49] suggest that the RUM description of the phonon dynamics
is actually not appropriate, which is explained by the fact that the shortest Cu---Cu inter-
tetrahedral distances are the same as the Cu---Cu intra-tetrahedral distances. The structure is
simply too-closely packed to permit RUM flexibility. Actually it also turned out that there is
greater rigidity associated with the linear O-Cu-O linkage [49].

Finally, we consider two related materials that show NTE, ZrW2Og [50] and Y2W3Q 2 [51].
These both contain corner-linked octahedra (ZrOg and YOgÂ¢) and tetrahedra (WO,). Analysis of
the phonons by ab initio lattice dynamics calculations suggest that in both cases the low-frequency
dynamics are associated with rigid body motions of the WO, tetrahedra, and that the Zr-O bonds
are relatively stiff, but that there is allowed bending of the octahedral bond angles [52,53]. Here,
I point out the important fact that in the general case (perovskites being the exception) systems
consisting of octahedra within the network will be over-constrained and no RUMs are possible
[54]. ZrW2Og is in principle allowed to support RUMs because one of the vertices of each WO4
