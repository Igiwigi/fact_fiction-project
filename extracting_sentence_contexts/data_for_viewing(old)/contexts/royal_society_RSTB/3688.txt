it was found subsequently to the publication of my case that FAuRE had not been the
first to perform spino-facial anastomosis, but that a similar procedure had been done
previously, but left unpublished, and apparently not followed by very satisfactory
results. Of these, the first so far discovered was a case published in 1903 by
Bronisias SAWICKI (28), of Warsaw, as having been performed by T. Drospyrk in
1879, but not previously published. The entire account of it is as follows :—“ Sujet
homme. Paralysie faciale due & la suppuration du rocher. On réunit le bout péri-
phérique du nerf facial avec le bout central de la branche externe du spinal. D’abord,
résultat nul, mais aprés plusieurs mois on apprit que les traits du visage étaient
deyenus plus symétriques.” Bronistas Sawicki makes the following comment upon
the case :—‘ Le résultat n’a pas été trés satisfaisant.”

The fact that in Poland no further attempt appears to have been made to
repeat this operation till 1901, when W. Szreyner* did the operation, as described
by Faure and Fursr, shows that the result of the operation of Drosnik does not
appear, if known to his countrymen, to have been considered sufficient to warrant
its repetition in other cases.

The other case was performed by BALLANCE (29) in 1895, but was not successful

* After SAWICKI (28).
