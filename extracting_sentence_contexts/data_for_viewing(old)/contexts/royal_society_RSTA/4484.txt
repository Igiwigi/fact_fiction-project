the ‘deviation of classicality pattern’ over all the considered pairs of concepts and their negations.
Indeed, we not only find a strong and stable numerical deviation independent of the considered
concepts and exemplars, but we additionally show in §5 that the numerical size of the deviation is
‘almost’ equal to the deviation of our five classicality conditions ‘if we substituted the theoretical
values for an average quantum model by means of our Fock space model of the situation’. Hence,
as a second, equally unexpected and for ourselves surprising result, the data indicate in a very
strong way that the deviation is exactly the one that would theoretically be found if the situation
is modelled quantum mechanically by our Fock space model.

Following the above-mentioned results, we believe that our findings strongly support the
validity of our quantum-theoretic framework in two-sector Fock space, which we summarize in
§4, and also our explanatory hypothesis that human reasoning is the superposition of a dominant
emergent dynamics and a secondary logical dynamics [31]. In fact, they indicate that the human
mind generally combines the concepts A and the negation B’ of the concept B by forming a new
concept ‘A and B’’, which emerges as an independent conceptual entity. But, superposed on this
mechanism, a second dynamics acts, where the new concept ‘A and B” is recognized as a logical
combination of A and B’. Our two-sector Fock space is a mathematical framework for representing
faithfully these processes, as we conclude in §6.

Our experiments involved 40 human subjects, chosen among our colleagues and friends, and
exposed to a ‘within-subjects design’. This is the typical number of participants in a cognitive : a
experiment estimating conceptual membership—in particular, Hampton’s experiments, with 1
