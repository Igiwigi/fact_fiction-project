It is an effect more readily obtained than
the last, but like it can only be evoked in a stage of moderate ether narcosis, as
excitation of the same area in deeper narcosis results in slowing of the movements of
the cords, or arrest in adduction, according to the precise degree of narcosis. 7. Intensification and Acceleration of the Movements of the Vocal Cords.—This is
not nearly so easy to demonstrate in the dog as compared with the cat, owing to the
fact that the movements of the dog’s cords are as a rule very energetic, except in the
deeper stages of narcosis. This being the case, in order to show the effect well in
dogs, it is as a rule necessary to place the animal as deeply under the influence of
ether as is necessary to obtain slowing of the movements of the cords on excitation of
