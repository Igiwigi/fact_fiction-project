8 one or two-tenths of a millimetre left between the point and the under surface of the

% There is one occasion, however, when the beam should be lowered by about a
= centimetre, namely, when a test is being made for any movement of the knife-edges
-€ under the blocks with respect to the interference tripod screws on the top of the
© blocks. In the form of apparatus now described this movement is practically nil,
& but it is well to have a means of confirming the fact by a direct determination. In
& Kocu’s apparatus it amounts to as much as the equivalent to two interference bands,
g as the second reflecting surface is not supported by the blocks, but independently.
© For this purpose instead of a plate a block of glass, 1 centim. thick, has been
provided, which may be assumed to be unbendable, and any movement of the
interference bands on allowing the weight to act as usual must be due to movement
of the parts of the blocks, from knife-edges to tops of screws.

In order to provide for this determination the square plinth is separated from the
rectangular basal box by a similar square plate of brass 1 centim. thick, and the
fixing screws are long enough to pass through both plates into the box top. When
the determination in question is to be made, this insertion plate is removed, and the
square plinth fixed directly to the box. The beam will then be at the right height
