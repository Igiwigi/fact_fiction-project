The life-time of H} is principally dominated by the electron density, since the molecular ion is
destroyed via dissociative recombination with electrons:

H} +e" > H) +H (2.5)

and [=
Hi +e —H+H+H. (2.6) 13

Both H* and H# can also react with other heavier species, and the following reactions are
extremely efficient for any species X with proton affinity greater than molecular hydrogen: ia

Ht +X — XH* + Hp e7

and : S
Ht +X —> XHt. (2.8) :§

This very effectively destroys H+ and Hf close to the homopause where hydrocarbons (e.g.
methane, acetylene and ethane) are present. Methane is present in the stratosphere because it is
transported vertically from depth, and methane photochemistry drives the production of species
such as acetylene and ethane (e.g. [5,6]). The fact that Ht and Hy and hydrocarbons cannot coexist
has two implications. Firstly, a planet with strong vertical eddy mixing in the stratosphere move
hydrocarbons up to higher altitudes, reducing the size of the H} ionosphere. A change in the
homopause height could therefore dramatically change the vertical profile of the ionosphere.
