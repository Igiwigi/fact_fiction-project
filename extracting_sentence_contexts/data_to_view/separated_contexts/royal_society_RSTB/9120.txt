Self-medication has been studied intensively in the African
great apes [92], where two self-medication behaviours,
bitter pith chewing and leaf swallowing, have been observed
widely among chimpanzee, bonobos and lowland gorilla
populations [92]. While it might seem that social learning is
limited to highly intelligent animals, such as primates, it
may play a role in self-medication in other species, too [93]. In fact, evidence indicates the potential generality of this
behaviour among other taxa [33,94,95] including fruit
flies, where females respond behaviourally to parasites by
‘medicating’ their offspring [96]. An important question in the context of this theme issue
on the health-sociality—fitness nexus concerns whether
these behaviours are learned socially. Young wild chimpan-
zees have been documented to carefully observe self-
medication behaviours by others, typically their mothers,
and then attempt such behaviours immediately after [97].
