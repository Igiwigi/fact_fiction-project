6.—Record of L of Mimosa with a 200 d.v. recorder. Time interval between successive
dots is here 0°005 sec. T have been able, moreover, to construct a vibrating recorder whose frequency is
500 times per second, a fact which enables us to make an easy determination of time-
intervals less than 0°001 sec. These recorders, owing to their excessive lightness,
have the additional advantage of having a very small moment of inertia, It is

Fic. 7. obvious, therefore, that the employment of such
recorders would not only bear favourable com-
parison with those at present used in animal
physiology, but would also have the advantage of
reducing the error due to inertia to the minimum
possible, and of making the record itself its own
chronogram. It has been said that owing to the extreme
lightness of the vibrating recorder, the slight
error usually due to instrumental inertia is here
negligible.
