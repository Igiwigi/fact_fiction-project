However, there is a far larger problem revealed by figure 1. We have so far identified only 64
O-type stars in M31, and 130 in M33 [7]. These numbers can be contrasted with those expected
given the number of WRs in these galaxies, 154 and 206, respectively [7]. (The fact that M31 is
a much larger galaxy than M33 but has fewer WRs is a reflection of its lower star formation
rate.) According to the Geneva single-star evolutionary models [8], there should be 15x more
O-type stars than WRs, suggesting that there should be 2000-3000 O-type stars present. Where
are the others? As the problem occurs for both M31 and M33 we believe this is not telling us
something profound about massive evolution.
