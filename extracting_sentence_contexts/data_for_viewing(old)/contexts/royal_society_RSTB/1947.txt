down or thins out at the poles, although the lateral walls still sharply delimit the
nuclear space from the surrounding cytoplasm. The polar radiations from the ends
of the spindle for the most part end in the protoplasmic substance of the oogonium,
and do not reach to the outer limit of the cell. Some importance has heen attached

to this fact by Dritner,* in opposition to HEtDENHAIN ; but our own studies have
convinced us that both kinds of radiations exist, sometimes the achromatic fibres
appearing to end on the wall, whilst in other instances none could be traced so far,
but all ended in the internal cell-protoplasm. The persistence of the radiations
throughout the equatorial plate stage is worth noting, for in many of the higher
plants this is not the case; and in Pellia, a liverwort in which they are very
prominent during the early and late phases of mitosis, they completely disappear in
this intervening stage. Not improbably the fact is to be correlated with the rapidity
with which the karyokinetic process is passed through in Fucus as compared with
many other organisms. We have already hinted at evidence pointing to this con-
clusion in our remarks on the importance of securing the plants during a certain
state of the tide. The appearances of the mitotic phenomena are such as to bear
out the conclusion, arrived at on other grounds, that in Mucus karyokinesis is asso-
