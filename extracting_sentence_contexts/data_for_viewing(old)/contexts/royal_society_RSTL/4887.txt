September.—Also a changeable month. Rain twelve days.

October.—A very fine month. No rain mentioned after the 7th.

A careful examination of this interesting register will explain several of the appa-
rently irregular inflections of the curves of glacier motion. Thus (to continue our
general remarks, p. 186) we find

V. At the upper station on the Glacier des Bois the least velocity occurred in De-
cember, whilst at the lower station (and at both of those on the Bossons) a minimum
coinciding also with that of the temperature of the air took place in January. This
coincides with the important fact noted in the preceding register, that the upper part
of the Mer de Glace was covered with snow from the 16th of October, which only lay
in the valley of Chamouni from the 20th of January; the snow screening the ice
from the extremity of the cold.

VI. The comparative march of the two glaciers bears a remarkable relation to
their positions and form. In the Bossons we detect at once the sudden transitions
and seemingly capricious changes of a torrent; in the Mer de Glace we have the

+ It will be seen from the temperature curves that the thermometer Fell considerably in the latter part of
June, both at Geneva and St. Bernard.
