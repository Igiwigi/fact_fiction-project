to the magnitude of the disturbances, and the shortness of the time during which the
observations at either station were maintained ; or there may be a real difference in the
epoch and amount of the secondary maximum. The accord at the two tations of the
principal easterly maximum in abs0ute time and of the principal westerly maximum in
local time is too remarkable to be passed unnoticed, though it is certainly possible that
the accord is in both cases simply an accidental coincidence. The stations at which
the laws of the disturbances have been approximately inyestigated are as yet too few to
make an attempt at a more extensive generalization, at present, either safe or adyan-
tageous. What seems most to be desired is, that stations for further research should
be selected upon a systematic plan, and with reference especially to their geographical
relations; and that the inquiry should not be limited to the disturbances of the decli-
nation, but should include those also of the dip and total force. By the combination
of the facts which would be thus obtained, we might have a reasonable prospect of
gaining an assured knowledge of the general laws by which these phenomena are
governed in all parts of the globe. To initiate this scheme of research, which would
have been at the same time important to science and honourable to our country, was the
object of the recommendation made to Her Majesty's Government in 1858 by the two
principal scientific institutions of Great Britain. Until some such systematic proceeding
is adopted, the progress of this branch of magnetical science is likely to remain frag-
mentary.

Port Kennedy and Point Barrow haye a common magnetical relation in being both
situated to the geographical North of a critical locality in the magnetic system, viz. the
locality of greatest total magnetic force in the northern hemisphere, or the centre of
the larger loop of the isodynamic lemniscates. The geographical latitude is nearly the
