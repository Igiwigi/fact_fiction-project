This
singular energy is probably due to the presence of ozone in the electrolytic oxygen
(though-it was passed through a tube filled with silyerJeaf). I shall repeat the expe-
riment, passing it through a red-hot tube. This fact may explain the absorption of
oxygen in Geissler tubes, which was obseryed by PLicxer; for Hg yapour must be
present in them, as they are exhausted by a mercurial air pump. The deposit in CO
was black below, grey above: the first was dissolyed by nitric acid, the other not; it
was probably some form of carbon from the decompoxsition of the gas; of that, how-
ever, there was a large residue present. 'The spectrum of Hg vapour has a few very
brilliant lines, but the rest are narrow and faint on a very dark ground.
