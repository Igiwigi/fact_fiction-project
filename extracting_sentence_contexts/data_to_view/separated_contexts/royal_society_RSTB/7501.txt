It is also suggested that stationary
waves in two dimensions could account for the phenomena of phyllotaxis. The purpose of this paper is to discuss a possible mechanism by which the genes of a zygote
may determine the anatomical structure of the resulting organism. The theory does not make any
new hypotheses; it merely suggests that certain well-known physical laws are sufficient to account
for many of the facts. The full understanding of the paper requires a good knowledge of mathe-
matics, some biology, and some elementary chemistry. Since readers cannot be expected to be
experts in all of these subjects, a number of elementary facts are explained, which can be found in
text-books, but whose omission would make the paper difficult reading.
