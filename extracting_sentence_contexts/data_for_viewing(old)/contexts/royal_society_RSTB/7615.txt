are of less value, as frequently they are the name of the material, usually bamboo, of
which they are made.

It must be remembered that these names, at all events so far as Papua is concerned,
have been recorded by very different kinds of persons, few of whom have received a
scientific training and still fewer could profess any acquaintance with linguistics or
phonology. There is very little uniformity in the methods of transcribing native words
and the recorders wrote down what they heard as well as they could. There are certain
sounds in the different languages which admit of being appreciated and consequently
of being written down in slightly different manners. Even all the natives of a given
locality do not pronounce words in precisely the same way and there are some sounds
which are particularly obscure or variable. In some instances there is a further
ambiguity due to the fact that the names may have been recorded or transmitted by
an interpreter from another area who may have unconsciously slightly altered the
sounds, or even possibly in a few cases may have given a wrong name.

In order to facilitate reference I have here retained in the main the geographical
order which I have adopted in the descriptive sections of this memoir. Most of the
native terms have already appeared in their appropriate places, but others have been
added so as to make the enumeration as complete as is practicable. In order not to
burden the text with references, I have not given the sources for these additional
names. For the most part they have been taken from the Annual Reports of British New
Guinea or of Papua, as the case may be, beginning from 1888 and continuing to the
latest Report.
