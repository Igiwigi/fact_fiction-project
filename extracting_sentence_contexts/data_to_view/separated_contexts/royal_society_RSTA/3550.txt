In the case of PEVs, Tesla announced
the Tesla model-3 vehicle, which has a driving range of 215 miles, to be in series production
in 2017 for a price of US$35 000 for the cheapest option [32]. However, FCEVs are predicted to
become affordable at scale, and cost competitive with ICEVs with an annual production of 0.5-1
million FCEVs [33-36]. In fact, after 2025, a McKinsey & Co. analysis [34] predicts that the total
cost of ownership converges for all types of vehicles (FCEV, PEVs and ICEVs) as costs of these
vehicles benefit from learning and economies of scale. Another study [37] goes even further to
show that if the carbon price is high, then the FCEVs become progressively cheaper than the
conventional ICEVs. While there is clearly much uncertainty regarding how the competition between the types of
vehicles will evolve with customers, it is likely that multiple low-carbon options will exist in the
market with PEVs used as smaller vehicles for urban driving and FCEVs used as larger vehicles
for long-distance driving and fast refuelling.
