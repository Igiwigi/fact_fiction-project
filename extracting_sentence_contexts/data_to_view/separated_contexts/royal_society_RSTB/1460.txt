| In the vaselined leaves under consideration with their stomata blocked, carbon

Q dioxide might reach the intercellular spaces round the assimilating cells by two

% possible paths, by diffusion through the cuticle and epidermis cells, or through the

film of vaseline blocking the mouths of the stomata. Experiment XXXIV. shows that only one-seventh as much CO, reaches the
& assimilating cells by the conjoint action of these paths as passes by the open stomata,
S and in a future section (VI.) I hope to give some facts tending to show what share
fi each path takes. Bi Having thus fully cleared up the experiments of Bousstncavtr’s first class, which
ep deal with the localization of gaseous exchange, we may turn to those of the second
‘e class, which really deal chiefly with the localization of the action of light on the leaf. = Two expedients were adopted by Bousstncautr to effect, for the purposes of com-
3s parison, an isolation of the action of light on either surface of the leaf.
