Breaking the commutator in (2.1) into

and ive Vf + iemf +(-AG+8A)=0, Bf +fg=0. We linearize them with respect to (&1,fi, Ai), and in the normalization conditions we use
expressions for the background Green functions (3.14) together with the symmetry relations (2.3):

Here, we have to treat the gradient terms non-perturbatively, since we expect that they have the
same magnitude as the uniform terms. Combining pairs of equation in each line we eliminate &

Using the fact that the unperturbed solution is uniform, VR&o = 0, we can use the second equation

The gradient term on the right-hand side acting on the OP can be dropped since it is odd in energy
and will disappear after +e, energy summation in the self-consistency equation. Equation for the
