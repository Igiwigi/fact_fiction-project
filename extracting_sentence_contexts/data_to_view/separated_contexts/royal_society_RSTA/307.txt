In the figure, the solid horizontal line is the thermal noise calculated
for this cavity. So even coherent lasers are limited by thermal noise!

5. Other applications for standards’ technologies

There is a potential weakness of incorporating experimental facts, whose validity
we can know only approximately, into statements that we come to rely on. Take
for instance: ‘the Speed of Light is a Constant of Nature’. Well yes, let us do start
with that and then see in which decimal the deviation will be found.
