Thus, since 10-02 ¢.c. of M/100 kojic acid absorb 9-92 ¢.c. of N/10 iodine and
produce acid equivalent to 11-10 ¢.c. of N/10 sodium hydroxide, it follows that
during the reaction between iodine and kojic acid, one molecule of the latter absorbs
10 atoms of iodine (thus again confirming the previous results), and produces acid
equivalent to 11 molecules ofa monobasic acid. This is distributed as follows :—

(a) 7 molecules as hydriodie acid equivalent to the 7 molecules of alkaline iodide
estimated (see p. 148).

(b) 1 molecule as formic acid (see p. 144).

(c) 2 molecules as one molecule of oxalic acid (see p. 145).

(d) 1 molecule as glycollic acid (see p. 146). Hence it is clear that no other acid is formed during the reaction, and this is
supported by the fact that, although carbon dioxide was tested for among the reaction
products, its presence could not be demonstrated. It is now possible, from a consideration of the results obtained, to construct an equation
for the reaction. The results may be briefly summarized.
