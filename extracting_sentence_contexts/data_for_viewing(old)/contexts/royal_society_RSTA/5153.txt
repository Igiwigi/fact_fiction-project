a smaller second moment of waterplane area, or a less strict limitation on the distance between
CG and CB of the system, or the mooring system needs to provide a lower stiffness coefficient, or
a combination of these. Whatever be the case, in general, this advantage can be translated into a
less costly floating support structure and/or mooring system.
Same minimum stiffness required, but still less costly floating support structure and/or mooring system.
The lower position of the CT in figure 4 is mainly due to the novel geometry of the NOVA VAWT.
For other VAWT geometries, such as the Darrieus configuration, or the H-type, the CT position
will be higher, and the thrust force can be of the same order as the VAWT system. This may lead
to an inclining moment imposed by the VAWT similar to the one imposed by the HAWT.

Nonetheless, having the system elements that for HAWT are in the nacelle (gearbox, generator,
ancillary systems) at the base of the tower can lead to a lower CG for the VAWT system compared
to the HAWT system. Even in this case, despite the fact that the minimum restoring moment is the
same for the HAWT and VAWT, the lower CG for the VAWT will mean a higher contribution to the
total stiffness from the term B in equation (3.1), and therefore a lower contribution is needed from
the terms A and C. Again, this can be potentially translated into a less costly support structure.

(c) Dynamic response comparison

Following the presentation of static characteristics, a dynamic response comparison is presented
below. The comparison is performed for wind-only conditions, i.e. there are no incident wave
forces acting on the FOWTs and calm water is considered. The wind speeds considered shall be
the respective rated wind speeds of the HAWT (11.4m s-!) and VAWT (12.9ms~1) systems. The
dynamic response was computed using coupled dynamics code FloVAWT, see Collu et al. [18],
with VAWT aerodynamic forces derived from the Double-Multiple Streamtube blade element
