chorion by the intervening mesoderm, and of a small solid triangular mass of cells
which lies below and adjacent to the embryonal ectoderm, and which Srreerer is
inclined to believe is the endoderm of the yolk-sac ; but owing to the lack of the adjacent
sections, it is impossible to say whether or not it is solid throughout. The embryonal
primordium is clearly much earlier than that of SerenKa’s Keim §., and so, if our
interpretation of the latter is correct, the yolk-sac endoderm here might very well be
represented by a solid mass.

The structure of the fully-established embryonal primordium in Man is illustrated in
Pl. 20, fig. 118. The figure is a photomicrograph (by kind permission of Dr. FLortan)
of a transverse section through the Beneke embryo (StRAHL-BENEKE, °10), a short
distance in front of the primitive streak, and serves to demonstrate very clearly the
cardinal fact that the early human embryo, just like that of the Pithecoid, is formed
of two superimposed vesicles, the amnio-embryonal and yolk-sac vesicles, enclosed
by an investing layer of mesoderm and situated close below the chorion in an extensive
exoccelomic cavity. The primordium is suspended from the chorion by the connecting
stalk, which, as we have already seen (ante, p. 102, and text-fig. 17*), has precisely the
same relations and, in all probability, the same mode of development as that of the
Pithecoid. This fundamental similarity in the constitution and relations of the early
embryo in the Pithecoid and Anthropoid types provides, it seems to me, indisputable
evidence of their direct genetic relationship.

Certain features, distinctive of the Anthropoids, are to be regarded as the direct
outcome of the interstitial mode of implantation of the blastocyst, and consequently as
purely secondary specializations of adaptive significance. These include the following :—
