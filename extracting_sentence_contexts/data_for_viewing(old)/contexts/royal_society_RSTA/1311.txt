At the verification step, indentation depth for the spherical indenter was set to 6*=
8.770177786585117 x 10-° mm. The corresponding value of the indentation force was evaluated
in Ansys as 0.0899206N. Compared with the value of P*, this shows the relative error of
0.0977341%. Next, the contact radius was approximated directly from the Ansys output by finding
the outermost contact node indicating the closed contact status, which gave the value of 0.402 mm,
whereas the theoretically predicted value was the initially set a* =0.4mm. Hence, the relative
error was 0.5%.


Thus, despite its increased complexity, the two-model approach to reconstructing parametric
force-displacement dependency exhibits its high accuracy. The above example also demonstrates
the fact that the properties of slopes of force-displacement curves discussed in Section 3 are
applicable to FEM calculations as well.
