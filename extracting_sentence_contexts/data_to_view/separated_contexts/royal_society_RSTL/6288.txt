More-
over, it often happens that one or a few epithelial cells are attached in Arachnida to
the inner side of the follicle-wall. This happens, however (80 far as my observations
go). without any regularity, and the cells thus present fulfil perhaps no important
function in the formation of the egg. The Crustacea* appear to differ from the three
preceding groups in the fact that their eggs do not possess separate follicles. The
nuclei of the epithelial cells in the ovary of Oniscus are about x#7ths of an inch in
diameter, with a bright nucleolus; but along the inner edge of the oyary one or two may
generally be found as much as gogoths of an inch in diameter, but not otherwise differ-
ing from the small ones. Between these extremes all intermediate stages may with
patience be discovered.
