This list is complemented
by the many improvements in practical telegraphic and telephonic systems he contributed over
his lifetime. His achievements (with the correct attribution) are not well known, yet they are profound and
wide-reaching. The so-called ‘Maxwell Equations’ or ‘General Equations of the Electromagnetic
Field’ [1], as presented in every undergraduate physics textbook in the world are in fact in the
form presented first by Heaviside, in the language that he independently developed for the
purpose (alongside W. Gibbs, known for ‘Gibbs phenomena’ in Fourier theory). This ‘recasting’
alone is a major achievement, for which Heaviside was given credit by Heinrich Hertz [2].
