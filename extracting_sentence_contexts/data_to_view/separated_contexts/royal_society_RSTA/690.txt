DISPERSION OF AIR FOR THE VISIBLE SPECTRUM 23

vational work, for considerable intervals occurred between certain of the series to allow
the microphotometric measurement of previously obtained records to be completed;
and it was also found advantageous to fit in the observational work at different
temperatures with the seasonal changes of temperature so that the difference of tem-
perature between the étalon enclosure and its environs was reduced to a minimum. Moreover, the particular period mentioned happened to coincide with a phase of the
present cycle of sunspot activity when this activity was increasing at its maximum rate,
and therefore offered a very convenient opportunity for testing Tilton’s suggestion
regarding the relation between the refractivity of dry air and sunspot activity.

(b) Values of the length of étalon Ly. In view of the fact that invar, even when it has
had stabilizing treatment, is subject to secular changes of length, the optical length of
I) was determined absolutely on three occasions during the period occupied by the
measurements of refractivity, in order to obtain information concerning the magnitude
of any such changes in length. The results of these three determinations, at different
temperatures, are given in the third column of Table II. Tase II.
