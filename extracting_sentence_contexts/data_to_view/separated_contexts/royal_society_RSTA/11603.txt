It is, however,
certain that there is no relation between either the structure of the mass, the
appearance of the fractures, the melting point of the alloyed elements, and the
mechanical properties given in the table on page 418. Every iron metallurgist who sees our photographs will probably think, at first
sight, that the alloy with potassium (photo. 5) will possess the best mechanical
properties and that the structure indicated by photograph 1 is deplorable. The fact is that from a mechanical point of view the alloy of gold with potassium
is the worst of all the series, and photograph 1 might equally well represent alloys
which vary in tenacity from less than half a ton per square inch to 7'75 tons per
square inch, and either are incapable of being stretched or may be elongated 32°6 per
cent. There remains to be considered the groupings (polyhedral or prismatic), from the
triple point of view of their external form, their internal structure, and their mutual
relations in the neighbourhood of each other. II.
