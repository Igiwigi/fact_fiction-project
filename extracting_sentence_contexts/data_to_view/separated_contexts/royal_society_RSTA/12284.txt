It so happens that (assuming v
continuous) L — P is such a vector, so that the difference between the result arrived
at in this paper and Professor PoyntrNe’s is just such a case as Professor THoMsoN
warned us to expect. We cannot then say that either L or P is the time flux of energy, but only that if
we assume either the one or the other (P being supplemented with P,) to be the flux,
the real changes of intrinsic energy will be accounted for.

106. Notwithstanding Professor THomson’s warning, many subsequent writers seem
to have taken Professor Poyntine’s theories for established facts. The following
statement of Professor Poyntina especially seems to have grown to be accepted
almost universally as a commonplace truth [‘ Phil. Trans.,’ 1884, Part IL, p. 361]:—
“T think it is necessary that we should realise thoroughly, that if we accept
Maxwett’s theory of energy residing in the medium, we must no longer consider a
current as something conveying energy along the conductor.
