in large quantity. Or if the cornea and iris be removed
anteriorly, and the vitreous humor and lens withdrawn, the
retina may be pulled from the membrane, which remains
attached to the choroid coat, its inner surface not tinged
by the black pigment, but presenting a clear white, not un-
aptly compared by HALLER to now.

Besides being connected to the retina, I find that the mem-
brane is also attached to the choroid coat, apparently by fine
cellular substance and vessels ; but its connection with the
retina being stronger, it generally remains attached to that
membrane, though small portions are sometimes pulled off
with the choroid coat. From this fact I think it follows, that
the accounts hitherto given of the anatomy of these parts,
are incorrect. The best anatomists* describe the external
surface of the retina as being merely in contact with the cho-
roid coat, as the internal with the vitreous humor, but both
totally unconnected by cellular membrane, or vessels, and
even having a fluid secreted between them : some indeed
speak loosely and generally of vessels passing from the cho-
roid to the retina; but obviously not from actual observation,
as I believe no one has ever seen vessels passing from the
one membrane to the other. My observations lead me to con-
clude, that wherever the different parts of the eye are in
