The young strobilus has
smooth surface, on which undulating swellings appear, as already noted by
igpisreR and by GorseL. At an early stage, the sporangia may be recognized as
réting at certain points on these outgrowths (compare figs. 1-4, Pl. 42), certain
racial cells, by their segmentation, supplying the essential parts of the sporangia. “gr hypothesis, we should see in these cells and the products of their segmenta-

an Equisetum, superficial cells provide the essential parts of the sporangia ; but this
- no real difficulty, for, ultimately, the same is the case in many Bryophytes ;
fmphithecium is, in the young state, a series of superficial cells, and it is this

portant.
