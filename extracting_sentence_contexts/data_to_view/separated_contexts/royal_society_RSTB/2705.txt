Fig. 6
(Plate 7) represents part of a section through the mucosa of a sheep killed towards
the end of the sexual season, #.e., a sheep that had passed through several recurrent
dicestrous cycles. The animal was killed four days after cestrus. The large quantity

of pigment formed was no doubt derived from blood which had been extravasated

* The quantity of pigment formed must also, of course, depend upon the number of procestrous periods,
This may be inferred from the facts stated below in the same paragraph.
