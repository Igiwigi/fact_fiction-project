The s8ame law may obviously be extended to contacts of higher degrees. The axis may be drawn, as before stated, in any direction throngh the point P ; it
may therefore be made to coincide with a tangent to the curve of intersection of U and
V at the point. But in that case it is obyious that two-pointic contact would subsist
for two positions (in fact for all positions) of the cutting plane without involving the
conditions for the ordinary contact of the two surfaces (viz. 3,V=0, 8,V=0, 3,V=0) as
a consequence. It is perhaps desirable to show that the formulz here employed take
cognizance of this circumstance, as well as of the corresponding circumstances in the
cases of contact of higher degrees. p

Suppose, then, that two-pointic contact subsists for two positions of the cutting plane
about the axis, say for the two planes (A, B, C, D), (A, By, C,, D,); then, adopting the
last form of the group (8), we have the two equations

Ad, V+Bd, V+ Ch, V=0,]
AdV+B3,V +C3,V=0.] *
Adding to these the two identical equations,
43,U+u3,V +w3,V=0,
u,U+3,V +#3,V=0,
and eliminating 3,V, 3,V, 3,V, we obtain the resultants
