(m—1)(Ad,A+Ba,H+0Cd,G)=29,H ;

and in like manner

(m—1)(Ad.A+Bd.H+Cd,G)=ad.H,

whence the equation in question. The terms in 7? are thus shown to be equal, and it
might in a similar manner be shown that the terms in py are equal; the other terms will
then be equal, and we have therefore

(d.V)H= Jac. (U, H, ®).
d,A+d,H+d,G=0
aszuned in the course of the foregoing proof is easily proved. Woe have in fact
d,A+d,H+d,G=d,(be—f*)+d,( fy —ch)+d(fb—g)
=b(d,0—d,g)+o(d,Þ—D,h)
+/{(—2d,f+d,9+dh)+9(d,f—dH)+h(—d,e+d;f),

whence also

that is

40. The identity
