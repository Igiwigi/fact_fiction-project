Here, pressure profiles are sampled from a
distribution that can represent many practical bubbly flow problems. Yet, the method is not
guaranteed to generalize well for drastically different external forcings. The former caution stems
also from the fact the used neural network is trained on a fixed time step, which may result in
poor generalization for cases with much faster dynamics. Section 2 formulates a model problem that serves as the basis for the proposed extension
of CHyQMOM, namely the dynamics of a population of cavitating bubbles whose statistics
are significantly non-Gaussian. In ยง3, the new hybrid method is described.
