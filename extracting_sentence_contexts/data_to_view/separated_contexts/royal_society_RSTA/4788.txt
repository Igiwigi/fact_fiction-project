There is an arrow from B to A if A
contains B with respect to simulation: that is, for each tile assembly system B € B there is a tile assembly system Ay € A that
simulates B. Dashed arrows denote containment, solid arrows denote strict containment and a self-loop denotes the existence
of an intrinsically universal tile set for a class and its omission implies that the existence of such a tile set is an open problem.
aTAM: abstract Tile Assembly Model (growth from a seed assembly by single tile addition in 2D), r denotes ‘temperature. 2HAM:
Two-Handed Tile Assembly Model (assemblies of tiles stick together in 2D). A 2HAM temperature hierarchy is shown for some
ce {2,3,4,.. .} and, in fact, for each such c the set of temperatures {c'|/ € {2, 3, . . .}} gives an infinite hierarchy of classes
of strictly increasing simulation power in the 2HAM. Citations proving the results are given in square brackets. Simulation results
for a number of other models are described in the main text.

the study of intrinsic universality in self-assembly, some previous self-assembly papers [17,38]
made use of notions that can be seen as precursors to the definitions and results discussed here
which perhaps lends weight to the intuition that spatially scaled dynamics-preserving simulation
is a natural way to compare self-assembly systems.
