Faraday Soc.,’ 1914, vol. 10, p. 89), and
the differences between the observed and calculated values are :—

1°2, 1°5, 1-6, 1:7, 1-7, 1-7, 1-8, 0°6°, Mean 1°5°. This agreement is remarkably close, having regard to the facts that (i.) the linear law
is only an approximation, (ii.) the extrapolation covers nearly half of the total range of
concentration, and amounts in the case of the violet mercury line to an extension of
over 12 degrees in the range of rotatory powers. In view of the fact that the linear law is valid to this extent over the wide gap between
the anhydrous acid and its saturated solutions in water, we were prepared to find that,
although closer examination would show marked deviations in the values for dilute
solutions, no substantial errors would occur in the case of the more concentrated solu-
tions.
