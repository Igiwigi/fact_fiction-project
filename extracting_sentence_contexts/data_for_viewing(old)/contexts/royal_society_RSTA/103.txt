formalism, the Goldstone theorem does apply. There are Nambu-Goldstone bosons, and because
the field gz satisfies the wave equation they are massless. But they are not physical, they are pure
gauge modes.

There is one further subtlety. We have spontaneous symmetry breaking in a gauge theory, but : 8
it is not, in fact, the local gauge transformations that are spontaneously broken. Indeed, in 1975, Dos
Elitzur [27] showed that spontaneous breaking of a local symmetry is logically impossible. In _
the Coulomb-gauge formalism, our gauge condition has eliminated the local gauge invariance; : Sy
it is broken explicitly, not spontaneously. But there remains a global symmetry. We chose ¢ to a

corresponds to the fact that gz may not vanish but be a non-zero constant.) It is this remaining : a
global symmetry that is actually spontaneously broken. Moreover, it should be emphasized that, : Ss
unlike for example the distinct degenerate ground states of a freezing liquid, our distinct vacuum DNS

8. Electroweak unification

The papers from the three groups I have described attracted hardly any attention at the time,
except for some scepticism. By the end of 1964, we knew of Glashow’s (or Salam and Ward’s)
SU(2) x U(1) model, and we knew of the mass-generating mechanism based on spontaneous
