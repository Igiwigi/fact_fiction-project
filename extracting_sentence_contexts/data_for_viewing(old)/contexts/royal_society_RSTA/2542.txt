row, one labelled 4, we need to be alittle careful. Clearly, we add 3 d.f. to the total, but we actually add three constraints rather
than the 4 we might expect from the fact that we create two new linkages. The point is that one linkage adds two constraints,
but the other linkage is formed by the correct orientation of this new square (as anticipated in the analysis of the rods shown in
figure 2), which means adding just one new constraint. Thus the number of additional degrees of freedom and constraints are
the same, and thus we will retain F — C = 4 for whatever size we now make the structure. (Online version in colour.)

Figure 7. Demonstration of the fact that a two-dimensional network of triangles connected within hexagonal rings has lines
of RUM wave vectors. We start with the arrangement labelled 1. With six triangles and six linkages, we have 18 d.f. and 12
constraints. When we add the second ring, labelled 2, we add 12 new df. and 10 constraints. We get the same for each additional
ring in the row, meaning that for a row containing N, rings we have F — C = 4 + 2N,. Next, we start the second row with the
ting labelled 3. The three triangles have a total of 9 d.f. and four linkages which give eight constraints. Therefore, we have added
1 to the balance F — C. Adding the second ring, labelled 4, adds two triangles and hence gives us 6 d.f. and six constraints,
fetaining the same value of F — C. We need to complete the row, which is the ring labelled 5. This requires an additional three
triangles, giving 9 d.f. and eight constraints. Thus the entire row has increased the value of F — C by 2. Thus if we have N, rows
of N, rings each we have a total of F — C = 2N, + 2N) + 2. We have not analysed the wave vectors of the resultant RUMs
here, but clearly they will correspond to lying on lines in reciprocal space. (Online version in colour.)
