Even the small
independent dimple 8 (a very frequent feature even in man) is nearly identical in both. Moreover, it appears that in Pithecanthropus underneath 7 another fissure (4) occurs
which runs in an archlike way. On the left hemisphere of Pithecanthropus it runs
somewhat steeper still, its course resembling more the relation of fissure 4? in my
Chimpanzee, which may be its primitive homologue, also on account of the fact that
the junction of 4 and 5 (= inferior precentral) in both falls exactly on the temporal
perpendicular} (which covers 5 in the Java ape-man). Fissure 4 of Pithecanthropus, however, is clearly the homologue of the human inferior
frontal, a statement made by Sir ArrHuR Kerru and by myself, independently of
each other. Dr.
