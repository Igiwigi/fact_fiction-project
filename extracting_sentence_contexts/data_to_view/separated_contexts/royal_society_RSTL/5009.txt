On this supposition we may regard % as always horizontal. Als0, if we put for y' its value (7.), the equation (12.) becomes

Hence, since 7 is horizontal, De .% > is vertical, and Dy. - is horizontal, The equa-

tion (12.), therefore, is CN into two parts, horizontal pe vertical, which,

being equated to zero, we obtain

We have to suhstitute for T in (13.) its value derived from (14.), which on account

of the smallness of 7, and the fact that T is multiplied by = in (13.), gives T=g for a
first approximation. Hence (13.) becomes

Now, here, the operation (Dy.) is performed only on lines at right angles to y;
we may therefore put 4/—1 for (Dy.) (se art. 55) ; and thus (15.) becomes
