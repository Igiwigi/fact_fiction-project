At h=4 the
ground state becomes ferromagnetic and Peround increases significantly, with monotonic increases
at larger h. We rationalize the varying success probabilities in the figure as attributable to structures of
the ground states at varying h and the interplay with the structure of the QAOA state in (3.3). We show in electronic supplementary material, appendix D that QAOA can exactly prepare
the ferromagnetic ground state when h> J; for arbitrary lattice sizes, based on the fact that
exp(—iy H) © exp(—iyh ye , Z;) in this limit. This is consistent with the behaviour in the figure,
where Peround increases monotonically with h for the ferromagnetic ground state at h > 4. We
further show in electronic supplementary material, appendix E how the anti-ferromagnetic
ground state probability is maximized at h=0.5, and we devise large y; parameters that can
further improve these results. (We did not include larger y; parameters in our numerical searches
as this can lead to poor Peround at parameters that optimize (H) for the frustrated lattices, as
