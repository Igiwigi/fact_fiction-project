amygdaloid or hastate, makes it clear that the men of these two industries were
independent and separate. Whether they were separated in place only, or also by
geologic time, remains for discussion. We cannot attribute the difference of their
types of implement to a difference of material.

When, however, we come to a comparison of the Pre-Crag implements with the
industry discovered by Mr. Bensamin Harrison in the high plateau gravel above
Ightham, in Kent—which are often referred to by the now useless word “ eoliths”
indiscriminately applied to all sorts of flint fragments of most varied age and
provenance—we have to remember, in the first place, that the age of this high
plateau gravel, whether anterior or posterior to that of the Red Crag, or coincident
with it, is altogether unknown. And, in any case, we have to take account of the
fact»that the flint which the Ightham men used was almost exclusively “ tabular”

flint, such as is formed in fissures in the chalk. The tabular flint of the South of
England is rarely so much as an inch thick, though removable from the chalk in
plates of a foot or more in area, The Ightham industry was largely determined
in form and character by this tabular form of much of the flint used. Though there
is nothing like close coincidence between the East Anglian and Kent Plateau
industry, yet in the “ borers” and trinacrial (shoulder of mutton) implements of the
