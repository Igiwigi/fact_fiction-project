based on (arbitrary) oper and obtain the fit result of, = aft - TRe¢- The confined frequency range
420-3600 Hz used for evaluation corresponds to skin depths 5 = 1/,/x fo between 0.32 mm and
0.11 mm.

The fit procedure benefits from the fact that the evaluated frequencies are above the roll-off
frequency of the TMEN spectra, which is about 230 Hz. By applying this method, we obtain an
average conductivity of 5.8706 x 10? (Q x m)~! with a relative uncertainty of 0.6% within the
examined temperature range 16-670 mK. For the temperature calculation, we use the individual
fit values ogj¢(T) obtained with T12(f).

(d) Noise and temperature spectra

An example of the spectra, from which the pMFFT temperatures are determined, is shown in
figure 5 for a dataset taken at the lowest temperature measured, i.e. ~16mK. In this example,
about 420 x 10° samples were taken in 700 min and processed to a CPSD having 8192 frequency
bins within 0.61-5000 Hz after 51 100 averages. The raw spectra contain some interference peaks,
which occur mainly but not only at the mains frequency (50 Hz) and harmonics. These peaks can
