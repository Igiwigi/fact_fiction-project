“ Let us consider the case, then, on the supposition of small masses of matter.
Where are we to find them? The answer is easy: in those small meteoric masses
which an ever-increasing mass of evidence tends to show, occupy all the realms
of space.

“The Nova now exists as a nebula, so far as its spectrum goes, and the fact
not only goes far to support the view I have suggested as against that of ZOLLNER,
but it affords collateral evidence of the truth of THomson and Tatt’s hypothesis of the
true nature of nebule.

“The nebular hypothesis in its grandeur and simplicity remains untouched by
these observations, the facts, so far from being in direct opposition to it, help us, I
think, all the better to know exactly what a nebula is.

“There is another point of extreme interest to the spectroscopist, if we accept the
bright line observed in the star by Dr. CopELanp and others to be veritably the chief
nebula line.

“Tt is clear from Dr. Vocet’s diagram, that this line brightened relatively with
each decrease in the brilliancy of the hydrogen lines. On December 8th, 1876, it was
much fainter than F, while by March 2nd, 1877, F was a mere ghost by the side of
it. On any probable supposition the temperature must have been higher at the
former date.”
