appearance of the vesicle there is no such connection—the separation of the brain
from the epidermis being complete. ,

The cells forming the back and sidé walls of the vesicle elongate as the latter
increases in size, and pigment is deposited at the surface of the upper (7.e., the part
nearest the interior of the vesicle) two-thirds of each cell. This is shown in fig. 57,
which is a drawing of a single cell from the back wall of an ocellus. The pigment is
all confined to the external two-thirds of the cell, the part round the nucleus being
clear. The end pointing towards the surface forms the rod (‘Stiibchen” of GRENACHER)
which is therefore terminal, not axial, thus agreeing with Parren’s expectations (15).
Ihave been unable to make out the fringed ends of the rods described by Gren-
ACHER (6). I find, in a transverse section cutting an adult ocellus in a plane parallel to
the surface, that I get the same appearance as GRENACHER described ; in fact, his figure
would serve for an exact representation of my section, but I believe this appearance,
which I do not get in similar sections through earlier stages, is due to the action of
reagents. At no stage of the development could I see anything like an axial fibre in
the retinal cells of the ocelli.

The cells of the exterior wall become flat rather than round, and their nuclei become
very faint during the latter part of their development.

The capsule forming the covering of the ocelli is a cellular membrane formed by the
mesoblast cells of the body-cavity which have been mentioned before. They begin to
form the capsule at a very early period of the vesicle stage.
