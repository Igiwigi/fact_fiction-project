tilages; and there is synovia and a capsular ligament. In the
snake, there is a regular ball and socket joint between every
two vertebre; 0 that the means employed for the motion of
the back bone in different animals, comprehends almost every
Species of joint with which we are acquainted.

Having mentioned a sufficient number of facts to-point out
the animals, in which the different structures of the interver-
*tebral-substance-are to be found, I have abstained from being
more particular in-my account; as it would in no respect elu-
cidate the principal object of the present communication.

From the facts-and observations which have been stated, it
appears' that the intervertebral substance of the human spine
does not-consist entirely of elastic ligament, dense in its tex-
ture at the circumference, and becoming- gradually softer to-
"wards the centre; but that the middle portion is composed: of
materials which render it very-pliant, though not at all elas-
tic; fitting-it to keep the vertebre at the proper distance from
-each other, so as to admit of the action of the lateral elastic
ligaments.

When this knowledge is applied to the treatment of cur-
