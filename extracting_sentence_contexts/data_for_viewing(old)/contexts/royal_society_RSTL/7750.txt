the usnal mode of firing. In the case of the detonation of gun-cotton imbedded in
such material, the force which is applied with comparative suddenness is to a consider-
able extent, expended in the disintegration and comprexsion of the surrounding material,
before there is time for motion to be communicated through any considerable mass of
the rock.

A further indication of the difference in the rapidity of explosion of gun-cotton by
detonation and by the simple application of heat is furnished by the difference in the
luminous effect observed in the two instances. The ordinary explosion of gun-cotton is
attended by a considerable body of flame, due to the ignition of the generated carbonic
oxide; but the detonation of gun-cotton is only attended by a sndden flash, which it is
very difficult to obserye in daylight if only small quantities are exploded. The trans-
formation of the solid into gas appears, in fact, to be too 8udden for the generated com-
bustible gas to become inflamed.

In conclusion, it may not be out of place to refer briefly to a few illustrations of the
important bearings which the new mode of developing the explosive force of gun-cotton
has upon the practical uses of the material as a destructive agent. The confinement
of a charge of gunpowder or gun-cotton in a blast-hole, by firmly closing up the latter
with earth, powdered rock, or other compressible material (by the process known as
tamping or stemming) to a depth greater than the line of least resistance opposed to
the action of the charge, is essential to the snccess of a blasting operation ; but the great
rapidity of explosion, by detonation, of a charge of gun-cotton greatly reduces the value
of this operation ; the destructive effect of the material, when exploded in a hole which
is left open, is not inferior in extent to that obtained by similarly exploding a charge
