This increase occurred in five out of the eight second-
set graft series and in certain of the first sets which underwent most destruction during the
interval. In either case the actual concentration of plasma cells increased significantly
without a significant change in the lymphocytes. This is no evidence in itself for the trans-
formation in situ, but it is a condition that would be expected if such occurred.

(7) The fact that the proportion of plasma cells to lymphocytes was very low in the
second-set grafts at the start of infiltration (4 days) and thereafter increased greatly is
again a condition to be expected if the transformation occurred. It is to be concluded therefore that while some of the immature plasma cells arrive as
such at the graft site via the vascular system, it is likely that others may originate at the
site from lymphocytes. Lymphocytes can apparently become transformed into histiocytes
after a short sojourn in the field of acute inflammation (Rebuck 1950).
