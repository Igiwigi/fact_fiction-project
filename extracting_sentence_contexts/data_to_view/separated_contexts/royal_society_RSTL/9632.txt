In a paper read before the British Association
in 1859, Maxwerrt gives the following explanation of the internal friction of gases —

« Particles having the mean velocity of translation belonging to one layer of the gas,
pass out of it into another layer having a different velocity of translation, and by
striking against the particles of the second layer exert upon it a tangential force which
constitutes the internal friction of the gas. The whole frietion between two portions
of gas separated by a plane surface, depends upon the total action between all the
layers on the one side of that surface upon all the layers on the other ide.”

The research here recorded commenced with experiments instituted to discriminate
between the friction of the pivot supporting the fly of a radiometer and the viscosity
of the residual gas. In the paper jusb quoted, MAXWELL presented the remarkable
result that on theoretical grounds the coefficient of friction, or the viscosity, should be
independent of the density of the gas, although ab the same time he states that the
only experiments he had met with on the subject did not seem to confirm his views,

An elaborate series of experiments were undertaken by MAXWELL to tesb 80 remark-
able a consequence of a mathematical theory ; and in 1866, in the Bakerian lecture for
that year,} he published the results under the title of * The Viscosity or Internal
Friction of Air and other Gases.” He found the coefficient of friction in air to be
practically constant for pressures between 30 inches and 0'5 inch ; in fact, numbers
calculated on the hypothesis that the viscosity was independent of the density agreed
very well with the observed values. The apparatus used by MaxwELL was not of a character to admit of experiments
with much lower pressures than 0'5 inch,

exhaustions.
