as mostly considered, merely the distal part of the ejaculatory ducts, but originates from
a separate invagination here termed the penis invagination, a structure derived from
a single median invagination which appears a little later and quite independently from those
of the ejaculatory ducts. The intromittent organ reaches its greatest development in Anisopus,
where, as in the Tipulidae, it forms a long filamentous projection; nevertheless, not
a growth outwards, but an organ essentially excavated by an intersegmental inflexion, the
genital pouch, part of which forms the large piston apodeme and its walls much of the
pompetta.

A large part of the structures surrounding the intromittent organ in the three species
studied, and perhaps in most Nematocera (notably the Tipulidae where the parts are often
very similar to those in Anisopus), are not derived from an appendicular origin but from
intersegmental sclerotizations here termed theca, penis sheath, etc., a fact clearly established
in following the development of these parts in the immature stages. In Chironomus there is
a thecal structure, endotheca, which is tucked inside the penis-tube cavity and is eversible.
In Anisopus a thecal sclerotization forms a guide (penis sheath) for the filamentous penis.
In Mycetophila the most conspicuous of the median structures is the large sclerotized pro-
minence of intersegmental origin, the penis sheath.

(e) Development of the ovary

In all the forms studied the young gonad appears as a mass of small undifferentiated cells
covered by a thin non-cellular peritoneal membrane. When differentiation of the germ
cells starts some of the cells, those which are nearest to the periphery of the gonad, become
larger than those more centrally situated. These larger cells aggregate in oogonial groups
