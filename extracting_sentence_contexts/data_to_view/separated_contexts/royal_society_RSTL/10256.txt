They serve two purposes, first as a check upon the wave-lengths quoted, and secondly
as a means of identifying the lines. Suppose, for instance, I wish to identify the line
in the indium spectrum which is mapped as double, it will be seen that the least
refrangible line stands at nearly 16, and the next at as nearly as possible 40 on the
scale. Applying an ivory rule to the photograph (oc. cit.), the rule being divided
into hundredths of an inch, 80 that the numbers 16 and 40 correspond with the two
least refrangible lines, it will be found that a very strong line stands at 120, and
it is this which appears as double on the map, though the fact cannot be seen by
examination of the printed photographs. A. reference to the table will show that at
119-31 and 119-68 on the scale there are two lines with wave-lengths 3257'8 and
3255-5, the former of which does not appear in solutions containing 4th per cent. of
the metal, while the latter continues visible even when only x}gth per cent.
