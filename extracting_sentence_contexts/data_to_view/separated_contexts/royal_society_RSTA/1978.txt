Moreover, it is worth noting how the increase in Reynolds number does not aaa
significantly modify the average distribution of non-dimensional viscosity at the three filling : BS
percentages here analysed. The presence of obstacles or solid boundary tends to deflect the : s
unperturbed flow distribution by generating baffles on non-dimensional viscosity. In fact, the : s
higher viscosity values are located near high curvature areas or edges present in the considered : s

geometry. No particular differences arise in terms of polymer distribution while increasing the
Reynolds number, which is different to what was observed in the previous test-case where a
sort of fingering effect was pretty visible. The mass distribution at the three filling percentages
considered is pretty aligned for both the PS and ABS, a phenomenon which is mainly driven
by the geometry of the porous domain.
