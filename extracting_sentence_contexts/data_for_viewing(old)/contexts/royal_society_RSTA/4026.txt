was designed. As mentioned in §2, with the second iteration of the webforms, we focused on

fixing and sampling time intervals around the peak of the eclipse in order to streamline data

entry, so we regard that process (of initial trial and revision) as having been rather successful.

(d) Participation aspects of the experiment

Participants were also invited to provide feedback on participating in the experiment. Overall we
found positive feedback on the engagement with the CS project.

‘We enjoyed being part of this - even if the skies were full of cloud!’, reports back one of the
participants. In fact, local weather may have dictated the engagement with the project because,
when skies were clear, the astronomical phenomena became the principal interest: ‘We did end
up giving up on the experiment - but only because the pupils being 10 years old struggled with
the excitement of the eclipse and taking readings at the same time! This is through no fault of
the way the experiment had been set up by yourselves. Everything was fully explained and clear
to follow.’ Obviously, for many of the participants, this was probably the first eclipse they had
experienced, and this would take precedence over the weather experiment. Nevertheless, if the
eclipse was not visible at a site due to cloud, the eclipse occurrence could, at some sites, only have
been evident from the temperature measurements.

Interestingly, Barnard et al. [7] report that CS volunteers collected half of the data during the
peak of the eclipse and the other half prior to and after the peak, which could be interpreted as
symptomatic of a genuine interest in the science goals associated with NEWEx. Unfortunately, we
