conducted under water or in the dry condition, since they protrude out of the first
incision, adhere tightly to forceps, scissors, or scalpel, and can hardly be disengaged
without being torn, or very often without carrying away, together with themselves, the
swrrounding viscera, intestine, generative ducts, &c.

Peripatus coils itself up, often, like Tulus, in a spiral with the head in the centre of
the coil; and small specimens always assume this posture when they are severely pricked
or maltreated. When in motion the animal extends its tentacles and body to their
full length, thus becoming of nearly twice the length which it measures when at rest
and proportionately narrower. The tentacles are kept in motion in search of obstacles,
and the feet are moyed rapidly in pairs, the alternate pairs moving together with consi-
derable regularity, but at the same time with the peculiar progressive movement of a
caterpillar. The gait is, in fact, extremely like that of a caterpillar. There is never
any wriggling or 8inuous movement of the body like that in worms. The ventral
surface of the body is entirely supported free of the ground by the feet. The animals

-are readily killed by immersion for four or five hours in water; and when thus treated
"they die in an extended condition, and are obtained in the most favourable condition
for dissection or preservation in alcohol as museum specimens. They are apparently
paralyzed after immersion for only a quarter of an hour in water, and remain extended
and motionless, but they s0on recover when placed again in the air. They can also be
- killed in an extended condition by being placed in a weak solution of chromic acid ;
