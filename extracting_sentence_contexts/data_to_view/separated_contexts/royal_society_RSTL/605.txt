Having covered 'the flat ends of both my
horizontal cylindrical vessels with gold-beater's:skin, I painted
one of these coverings (of this animal substance) black, with
Indian ink; and then, filling both vessels with boiling hot water,
I presented them, at equal distances, to the two opposite-balls of
the thermoscope,

place, by the superior efficacy of the calorific rays which pro-
ceeded from the blackened animal substance. On repeating this experiment a great number of times, and
when-the water-in the vessels was at different degrees of tem-
perature, (the temperature being the same- in the two vessels,
in each experiment,) the results uniformly indicated, that calorific
rays were thrown off from the black surface, in greater abundance
than from the equal surface which was not blackened. Although the results of these experiments appeared to me to
be 80. perfectly conclusive as to establish the fact in question,
beyond all possibility of doubt, yet, in so interesting an enquiry,
I was desirous, by varying my experiments, to bring, if possible,
a variety of proofs, to support the important conclusions which
result from it. Exper. No. 28.
