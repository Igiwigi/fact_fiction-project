These are so short-
lived that they can only be found in embryos of an age at which antennal rudiments are
first forming. They are median and posterior in position to the antennw and lie
immediately behind the shallow invagination of the future mouth. The next three pairs of appendages, mandibles, maxille and labium have a typical
development, and reference need only be made to the fact that they occupy the vertically
curved part of the head, the mandibles having a dorsal and the labium a ventral position
in the egg (fig. 2). A transverse section through this region therefore passes through
all three segments (fig. 50). If one examines embryos of the stage shown in fig.
