again. The changes of the culture medium were sufficient to induce resting spore
formation at low temperature and low light intensity but not advanced enough to
prevent germination immediately after the disappearance of these two factors. After
a few days the higher degree of overcrowding resulted in the production of persistent
resting spores which germinated only when transferred into fresh culture medium.
For germination fresh culture medium, i.e. the absence of the ‘“‘ overcrowding”? factor,
is of almost exclusive importance. It takes place in fresh culture medium under
otherwise the same conditions which induce the formation of resting spores in old
cultures.

How can these observations be applied to the conditions in the sea? The growing
diatom population during the spring and autumn outburst can certainly be compared
with a growing culture, and there is enough evidence for the fact that the over-
crowding of the surface layers of the sea results in the exhaustion or, at any rate, a
considerable decrease in the amount of nitrates and phosphates. The same may be
true for other substances which have not yet been studied quantitatively. It may well
be that the exhaustion of some substances during the outbursts is partly responsible for
the formation of resting spores just as in the cultures. It has been pointed out before
(p. 19) that the degree of “‘overcrowding”’ in the sea, i.e. the density of the plankton
population, need not be as high as in the cultures to be equally effective.

It appears, however, difficult to compare the two other factors in their effect upon
the plankton and the culture populations respectively. ‘‘In the Channel. . . Ditylum
