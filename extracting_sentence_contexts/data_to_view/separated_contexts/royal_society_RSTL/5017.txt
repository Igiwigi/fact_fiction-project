for CarxorT's function, which Mr. JouLs had suggested to me in a letter dated
December 9, 1848, as the expression of Mayer's hypothesis, in terms of the nota-
tion of my © Account of Carxor's Theory. *” Mr. RaxkixeF has arrived at a formula
agreeing with it (with the exception of a constant term in the denominator, which,
as its value is unknown, but probably small, he neglects in the actual use of the
formula), as a consequence of the fundamental principles assumed in his Theory of
Molecular Vortices, when applied to any fluid whatever, experiencing a cycle of
four operations satisfying Carxor's criterion of reyersibility (being in fact precisely
analogous to those described above, and originally invented by Carxor) ; and he
thus establishes Carxor's law as a consequence of the equations of the mutual con-
version of heat and expansive power, which had been given in the first section of his
paper on the Mechanical Action of Heat. 2. Note on the Specific Heats of Air. Let N be the specific heat of unity of weight of a fluid at the temperature #, kept
