Although the direction of oscil-
lation in this latter case is opposed to that observed when the spiral is active, still

the fact excites doubts as to the truth of the conclusions which have been drawn
from these experiments*. To deduce rigorously the demonstration of diamagnetic
polarity, it would be necessary to eubstitute for the bismuth, masses formed of insulated
fragments of the metal, to vary the dimensions of the cylinder, and above all, to com-
pare the effects thus obtained with those which world probably be obtained with cylin-
ders of copper and silver in a state of purity. Â« We are obliged to make the same remarks on another series of experiments
which this physicist has made to obtain anew, by the effects of induction, the proof
of diamagnetic polarity.
