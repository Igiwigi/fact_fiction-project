The above was made with young bark whose liber contained parenchymatous as well
as woody cells. In older bark the difference would be still more marked. The fact, of
the quinine being contained mainly in the exterior cellular tissue is in harmony with its
occurrence in newly forming structures, as detailed above.

T have never yet succeeded, although many attempts have been made, in conyerting
quinine into cinchonidine, or vice vers@, Nevertheless many phenomena in the living
plant point to the conclusion that a real change of quinine into cinchonidine occurs
therein. The order of the appearance of the alkaloids in renewing bark, the compara-
tive absence of quinine in the highly organized liber, the changes produced by sunshine
and heat, all point to 8uch conversion as a legitimate hypothesis; it is one that is not
contradicted by a single fact, and is in harmony with observyations made with very diverse
species of cinchona, and with the chemical similarity in the behaviour and properties of
the two substances.
