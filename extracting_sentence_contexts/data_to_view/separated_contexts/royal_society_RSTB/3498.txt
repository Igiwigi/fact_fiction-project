These figures, and
figs. 17 (manganese dioxide) and 30 (osmic dioxide), resemble very closely the
aggregation of living Euglene in fig. 10. In fig. 44 is shown the aggregation of
Chlamydomonas killed in a solution of osmic acid. The aggregation of these various sediments appears to depend upon the fact that
a thin film of particles, together with the surface layer of water in which they are
contained, acts as a liquid heavier than water. The aggregation is brought about
therefore not by the action of gravity upon the separate particles but upon the
mixture of particles and water as a whole, just as would be the case if we were
dealing with a homogeneous liquid heavier than water. Thus if we fill a shallow
vessel with water and then drop into it a small quantity of ink the ink sinks in the
water and spreads out to form a layer over the bottom of the vessel.
