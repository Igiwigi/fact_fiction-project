Nearly all families have the same general type of distribution. In the paper referred to, I pointed out that there was no particular reason why the
whole tree of descent of a family should not exist on the earth at the present
moment, and I suggested that all the Dilleniaceze might be descended from
Tetracera, the most widely distributed genus in the family. This idea that the
most widely distributed genera are the most primitive, rather than necessarily the
best adapted, receives great support from the facts which have been brought forward
in the present paper. It is true that these facts have chiefly been used to show that local commonness, on
the whole, increases with age, but as the commonest species are those of wide distribu-
tion, the next commonest those developed somewhere in Ceylon and Peninsular India,
and the least common those confined to Ceylon, we may take it as extremely probable
that wide distribution also goes with commonness, and therefore with age. 1t hardly
needs pointing out that quite possibly some of the species that are now of wide
distribution originated in Ceylon in very early times. The Ceylon endemics have not
yet nearly reached the stage of average distribution ; only, perhaps, when they have
become so old that the difference in age between them and the other species has
become negligible, will they do so.
