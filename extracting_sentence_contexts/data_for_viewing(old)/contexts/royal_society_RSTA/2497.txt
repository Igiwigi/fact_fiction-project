different paths. To make this more clear, suppose we have two different paths and we are allowed
to drag edges of those paths as long as we do it on coloured cells. If we can drag one path to

the other one following this rule, we have that those paths are, in some sense, the same, and we
identify those paths with one another. In figure 3, we show what we mean by dragging edges
within coloured cells (we omit some information from the graphs). If we kept dragging paths, as
shown in the figure, we would conclude that those two paths were the same. Now, as there are
two blank cells, we see that we cannot identify all paths. In fact, we conclude that if before we
had nine different paths, after these identifications we only have two paths.

(c) The analogy between paths and proofs

We now start to relate paths and proofs. Let us consider figure 1. There we had nine different
paths and these paths came from different applications of the rewriting rules, and these different
applications of the rewriting rules mean that we have different proofs of the statement f is in I.
Given that in figure 1 we have nine paths from f to zero, we can say that we have nine different
proofs. So a path in the graph of figure 1 corresponds to a proof. Hence, we are rephrasing our
problem on the identification of proofs into a problem on the identification of paths.

We noted that some paths could be identified with each other and with those identifications we
