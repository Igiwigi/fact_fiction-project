The retardation computed for the difference in latitude between the two sta-
tions is 0.15 of a vibration per diem, and for their difference in elevation being
about 50 feet and employing Dr. Youxc's co-efficient of .6, is 0.12 of a vibration
per diem. The sum of the two computed retardations is 0.27 ; which added-
to the acceleration 0.48 shown by the experiments, makes altogether 0.75 of a
vibration per diem ; by which amount the result of experiment differs from
what would haye been anticipated, supposing that no previous experience
had existed of the occurrence of such anomalies. With regard to the fact, of the existence of this irregularity between Green-
wich and London, it is one which admits of easy verification by persons who
may be disposed to repeat the experiments : the stations are convenient and
close at home ; and the magnitude of the irregularity is such as to preclude
uncertainty, since with proper precautions, it is not difficult to determine the
relative rates of an invariable pendulum to nearly 3th of the present irregu-
larity. With regard to its cause,—having already expressed the opinion that I had
been led to form on the occurrence in my former pendulum experiments, of
what I believe to have been irregularities of a similar nature,—it is unnecessary
now to repeat that opinion ; and having since seen no occasion to alter it, on
the contrary much to confirm it, I gladly leave the discussion to others whose
opinions are entitled to more weight. OF A PENDULUM AT GREENWICH AND LONDON.
