Re is the curve of electromotive force deduced from the potential
difference taken between the terminals of the alternator when supplying current
through non-inductive resistances. The curves E and Re have been integrated,
the corresponding integral curves being A and B respectively. That the ordinary theory does not fully account for the facts is easily shown. We have Ra = E — (Lz). Integrate both sides from any fixed epoch 0 to any time
t and we have

{ Re dt = [E dt — I, (a, — %).
0 0

Each term of this equation consists of a constant part and of a periodic part.
