of sources and applications. It introduces the key concepts of aggregation and committed and
peak access rates and also examines the special approaches of content distribution to efficiently
handle large traffic demands. Although much of the analysis uses UK-based traffic growth data,
nevertheless the fact that (as will be seen later) the annual growth percentage is much higher here
than the global average implies that the conclusions will be universally relevant.

The paper then seeks to extrapolate current growth measures over a long time period to
explore the impact on different parts of the network and especially the central core, in order
to assess when optical fibre capacities will be insufficient to meet the demand. The paper will
address this, proposing a range of solutions and required research to ensure that the core of the
network continues to be capable of sustaining the growing consumer appetite for high bandwidth
services in the future.
