united by a bulky cicatricial mass, while in two they were lying apart without any
apparent connexion one with the other. Where the nerve ends were united this
union was evidently not such as to enable function to be carried on, Where the ends
were lying apart the central end in both cases presented a bulb of hard consistence,

in one case ending in a tapering filament; while the peripheral end presented in the
one case a small hard bulb, and in the other a conical ending. What may have had
something to do with the different character of the two peripheral ends, is the fact
that the end with the bulb was lying free in loose connective tissue, while the
end with the cone was lying firmly bound down to the underlying structures
by means of cicatricial bands. The prevailing opinion is that it is useless to do
more than raw the peripheral end before suturing, but I always cut off the terminal
portions, and the sections exposed always showed an appearance resembling the
section of a nerve.
