2 (IX.) The Spectrum of Neon.

& Except for certain series suggested by Rosst} involving only a few lines, the
.o greater part of the Neon spectrum is of unknown structure, although some constant
g differences of frequency have been detected by Wartson.§

» One of the advantages of the mode of experiment described in this communication
mis that it may assist in elucidating the structure of very complicated spectra, and it
2 may, in fact, be combined with investigations of the Zeeman effect, which has been
3 used hitherto, as by Durour|| in connection with the secondary spectrum of Hydrogen,
gin the detection of different classes of lines in such spectra. A preliminary exami-
‘9 nation of a portion of the Neon spectrum leads to some very interesting results which,
3 however, at present cannot be brought within a general scheme of interpretation,

Bowing to our lack of knowledge of series relations with which they are without doubt
& = connected. The table contains a comparison of the spectra of Neon in the ordinary
& discharge and from the bulb, the gas containing a little Hydrogen. The enlarged
= length of the wedge was 42 mm. Only the stronger lines in the red and yellow have
e been subjected to examination, and if series exist in the spectrum, their leading
“3 members in the red and yellow should decrease considerably in intensity in the bulb,
