Other members of the DfrB family display similarly larities with DfrB1. These include similar pore size resulting

high recovery of activity following heating to 95°C and cooling from homotetramerization, the importance of the conserved

enzymes can be purified from lysate using incubation at 70°C of DHF and NAPDH, and the similar inhibition of both
