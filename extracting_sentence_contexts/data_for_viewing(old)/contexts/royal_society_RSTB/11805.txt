endophytes at various taxonomic and geographical scales
(e.g. collections along forest edges versus interiors, or forest
canopies versus understories, could correspond to different
endophyte communities; similarly, collection of younger foli-
age could result in leaves with fewer endophytes than more
mature leaves). Preservation methods for individual herbar-
ium specimens also may be important: whether leaves were
dried at high temperatures, quickly or slowly, or immediately
after collection could impact DNA quality or the capacity of
epiphytic fungi to colonize leaf interiors. Such issues could
lead to spurious results regarding endophyte diversity in the
broad sense, compounded by the multidimensional biases
that herbarium collections represent and the fact that the orig-
inal collections were intended for purposes other than those
described here [87,88].

Second, our proof-of-concept work focused on only two
species in one family, only on boreal plants, and only material
that had been archived for four years. Further analyses are
needed to determine whether the methods described here


will be successful for studying endophyte communities in communities that, with known quantities of DNA for each | 8 |
