THE SPINAL CORD IN MONKEYS. 25

has not observed degeneration in the anterior median column after extensive cortical
ablations producing most marked degeneration of the crossed pyramidal tract. The
latter observer has informed me that he has never seen degenerated fibres below the
8rd cervical, and the fact that they occur as low as this he accounts for by a prolonga-
tion of the pyramidal decussation.

We may consequently assume that in the Monkey there is no direct pyramidal
tract in the dorsal region, and that degeneration which occurs. below the hemisection
in the anterior median and anterior columns, is not the result of direct pyramidal
fibres, but of vertical commissural fibres between the nerve processes of cells of the
anterior horn and the grey matter at different levels.

K6éturker* states that the motor root fibres arise by a single nerve process from
large and small nerve cells at all parts of the anterior horn, which nerve process in
certain cases (according to Goxar always) gives off lateral branches.
