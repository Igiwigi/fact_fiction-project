57 two such divisions are
complete, and in a slightly older sporangium, shown in fig. 58, there are three. is, in fact, the common number of such divisions in the young sporangium as seen
ial section, and a comparison of a large number of sections, both at these early
Sand also older, leads clearly to the conclusion that the sporogenous tissue is
raterable in its origin to one cell as seen in radial section, but usually to three. feful comparison of figs. 56, 57, 58 clearly shows that the periclinal divisions
