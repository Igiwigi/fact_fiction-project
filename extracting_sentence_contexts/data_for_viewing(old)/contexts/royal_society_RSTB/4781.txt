When Rhexoxrylon africanum was first described, the occurrence of what appeared
to be polystely was put forward as evidence of Medullosean affinities.t But now, in
spite of newly described features, which in themselves would seem to lend support to
this view (e.g., the occurrence of secretory canals, and of small vascular strands in

the tissue external to the main xylem ring), other facts have come to light which
cause one to reconsider the relationships of Rhexowylon.

(i) The Secondary Wood.

In the first place, as Dr. Bancrort states,* the secondary xylem differs very
considerably from that of any Medulloseae of which the structure of the xylem
is known. The wood is distinctly compact or pycnoxylic, as opposed to the
manoxylict wood of the Medulloseae generally. The character of the medullary
rays is different, being uniseriate except where dilatation is occurring. The pitting
of the tracheids is decidedly coniferous in character, and there are well defined zones
of growth due to the regular alternation of different types of tracheids. This type of
wood structure is found closely paralleled in specimens of wood designated as
