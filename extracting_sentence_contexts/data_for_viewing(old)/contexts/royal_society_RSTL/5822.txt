rouleaux, and it was evident that the corpuscles had been excessively adhesive at the
time when aggregation took place. Some of the red discs were now s$queezed out from
the fibrinous mass in which they lay, and as they escaped into the surrounding Serum
they at once adhered firmly in that fluid, forming again compact globular masses, such
as, if in freshly-drawn blood, would necessarily give rise to the buffy coat; 80 that their
adhesiveness seemed to have been in no way affected by the withdrawal of the fibrine
from solution. Tt may of course be urged, that the fibrine, when in solution, may have
impressed upon the corpuscles an adhesiveness which they retained after soaking for
hours in serum, but this seems a very unlikely hypothesis. 1 suspect, therefore, that the
peculiarities of the corpuscles of inflammatory blood are the result of other changes than
the excess of fibrine.

From the facts detailed in this section, it appears that the aggregation of the cor-
puscles of blood remoyed from the body depends on their possessing a certain degree of
mutual adhesiveness, which is much greater in the colourless globules than in the red
discs; and that, in the latter, this property, though apparently not depending upon
vitality, is capable of remarkable variations in consequence of very slight chemical
changes in the liquor sanguinis,
