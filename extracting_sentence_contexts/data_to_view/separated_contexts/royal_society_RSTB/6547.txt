The only possible antecedent is an epithelial body in H.P.
which lies in a comparable situation and which is attached to the deep aspect of the
mouth epithelium (fig. 80, Plate 44); it only extends over two sections and is un-
represented in H.Q.or H.X. I am, therefore, forced to the conclusion that this dentinal
body is adventitious and is peculiar to the one side of the jaw in this particular specimen. In further support of this is the fact that it is additional to the constant epithelial body
“*dy,”’, it does not replace the latter as might be expected if it were a further differentia-
tion of such a body. The nodule “dy,” is present over the postero-medial cusp. 11—Platypus H.X.

This specimen measured 295 mm. in length.
