amount of this last constituent, but it was found to be too 8mall to be capable of
direct measurement; by the dynamometer. Moreover, from the manner in which the
figures in this column are deduced, any error in the dynamometric measurement will
appear wholly in them. Since, undoubtedly, the firs two components enumerated
are the most important, and the conditions determining their amount are practically
the same throughout the series, the close agreement of the figures in the column are a
fair criterion of the accuracy of the observations. Probably 100 watts is the limit of
error in any of the measurements. Such an error would affect the determination of
the efficiency when the machines were working up to their full power to less than
+ per cent.

1t has been assumed that the sum of these losses is equally divided between the
two machines. This will not accurately represent the facts, as the intensities of the
fields and the currents passing through the armatures differ to some extent in the two
machines. The inequality, however, cannot amount to a great quantity, and if it
diminishes the efficiency of the generator it will increase the efficiency of the motor by
a like amount, and contrariwise. In No. 11 of the series the effect of the sparking at
the brushes of the generator is very marked, the power wasted amounting to at least
250 watts.

Tf it be assumed that the dissipation of energy is the same whether the magnetisa-
tion of the core is reversed by diminishing and increasing the intensity of magnetisa-
tion without, altering its direction, or whether it is reversed by turning round its
direction without reducing its amount to zero, a direct approximation may be made to
the value of this component. (J. Hopxinsox, Phil. Trans., vol. 176 (1885), p. 455.)
