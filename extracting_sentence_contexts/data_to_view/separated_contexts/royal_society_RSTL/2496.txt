Comparison of Numerical Results. In proceeding to apply the formula to actual calculation, we are met by several
difficulties arising out of the peculiar form of the function. The process is, in fact,
reduced to finding arcs which shall fulfill the #w9fold condition of being themselves
in the ratio of the values of 7, while they are to their sines in the ratio of the values
of p. For this I have not been able to make any direct method available. By indirect and tentative methods, however, and the assumption of arcs which
were seen (from a table of the lengths of arcs,) to be nearly in the required ratio to
their sines, I advanced by successive trials of greater or less arcs to more exact
values.
