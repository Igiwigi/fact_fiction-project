The pupils of all three species are vertically oval when the animal is at rest. As
soon as it is disturbed by any noise or in any other way, the pupils instantaneously
dilate to a complete circle as if the animal had its iris under control. The fact that
the Hyzenas are distinctly night animals may account for this dilatation of the pupil
when the animal is roused. This likewise accounts for the brilliant yellow central
zone which throughout the Carnivora invariably occurs in nocturnal animals, being
least marked in those which prowl at dusk only. 4.
