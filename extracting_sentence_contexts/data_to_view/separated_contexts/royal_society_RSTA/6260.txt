Using multiple ab initio minimizations of pre-optimized glutamine
molecules placed in various orientations near the surface showed that the doped surface resulted
in many cases in the break-up of the glutamine molecule, while the deposition on the undoped
surfaces never produced a break-up. Proceeding to multi-atom/multi-molecule layers, the most straightforward one—also from
the point of view of the energy functions—is the study of the rearrangement of atoms in the
surface layer(s) of a bulk material [96-99]. Due to the fact that the atoms on the surface face the
vacuum on one side and the bulk on the other, the optimal arrangement is no longer identical
with the bulk positions, but all the surface atoms are slightly shifted. As long as this shift only
occurs in the z-direction (the original unrelaxed surface is assumed to be the xy-plane), this
effect is straightforward and often not even visible in the experimental structure determination. Of more interest are the so-called surface reconstructions, where the atoms are displaced in
the xy-plane, leading to a different periodicity on the surface than in the bulk.
