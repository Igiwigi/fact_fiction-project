The shape of Rademacher’s formula for p(7) would later be understood to arise naturally from
the method of Poincaré series by the work of Petersson, Rademacher and others (for example,
see the exposition in [5]). These are natural modular forms which are built as averages over the
translates of suitable special functions under the action of the modular group. In the case of p(n),
the generating function is essentially a weight —1/2 modular form.

In the case of half-integral weight Poincaré series, formulae such as Rademacher’s, understood
via the modern theory of Poincaré series, can be used to give finite, exact formulae for coefficients
of modular forms. One of the first important examples of this phenomenon was observed by
Zagier [6] in his work on traces of singular moduli (see also [7]). This idea also applies to p(n).
Namely, Rademacher’s exact formula for p() can be reformulated as a finite sum of values
of a single (non-holomorphic) modular function. This fact was first observed by Bringmann &
Ono [8], and the phenomenon relies on the fact that (1.3) can be reformulated as a sum over
equivalence classes of discriminant —24n +1 positive definite integral binary quadratic forms.
This observation was refined by Bruinier & Ono [9] to prove a much stronger statement.

To make this precise, we let n(t):=q¥/4 []2,(1 — q") (q:=e2""" throughout) be Dedekind’s
weight 1/2 modular form. Furthermore, we let Ep(r) := 1 — 24 721 Deajn dq” be the usual weight
2 quasi-modular Eisenstein series, and we let F(t) be the weight —2 meromorphic modular form

1 E(t) — 2Ex(2r) — 3E2(3t) + 6E2(6t)

F(t):= = “1_10—29q----.
5 n(e2n(2xPn@Be)?n(6r 1 q
Using the convention that t = x + iy, with x,y € R, we define the weight 2 weak Maass form
