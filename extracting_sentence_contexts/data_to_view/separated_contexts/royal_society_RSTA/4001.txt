One of the great advantages of dealing with a metal like lead
arises from the large size of its crystals; by enabling us to use deep etching it allows
all fine polishing to be dispensed with, and it becomes possible to obtain micro-
photographs at low magnifications, and under oblique light, which exhibit clearly the

various changes in crystalline structure. 286 PROFESSOR J. A. EWING AND MR. W. ROSENHAIN The low power required is a further advantage in view of the fact that an etched
lead surface must be kept wet with an acid solution while it is being examined and
photographed, as such a surface becomes dull and useless as soon as it dries. To identify the areas which were to be kept under observation, we marked them
by scratches or furrows made with a steel point. Unsymmetrical patterns of marking
were used for this purpose to facilitate replacing the specimen in its former position
and orientation.
