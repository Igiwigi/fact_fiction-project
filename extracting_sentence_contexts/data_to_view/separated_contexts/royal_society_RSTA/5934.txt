Continuous trading limit and Fokker—Planck approximation :

As known in several kinetic models in socio-economic sciences [10,23-25], it is very difficult
to deduce analytical properties on the behaviour of distribution functions starting from the
Boltzmann equations (2.2). Even in our frame, more complicated due to transfers of individuals,
it could be convenient to study the asymptotic regime usually called ‘continuous trading limit’,
since it could lead to simpler kinetic equations of the Fokker—Planck type, as in [9]. This regime
is based on the fact that, since the trading rules (2.5) and (2.26) concern each single binary
interaction, it is highly probable that the amount of exchanged wealth is very small so that, in
other words, the differences between post- and pre-interaction wealths are almost negligible. The market is thus described as a huge amount of small binary trades, and it can be seen as a
continuum. We measure all interaction coefficients in terms of a small parameter ¢.
