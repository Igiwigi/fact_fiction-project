+Q/2 separated by the diamond lattice bond spacing a, so that the effective dipole moment of
this dumbbell coincides with the original spin magnetic moment, which fixes the charges to be
Q=2,/a, the value derived above.
The dumbbell model is useful, since monopole charges are directly given by the sum of
dumbbell charges on a tetrahedron. The original dipolar interactions between spins are translated
into effective Coulomb interactions between these monopoles. This interaction is therefore of an
energetic origin, contrary to its entropic counterpart originating from an averaging over the many
degenerate configurations compatible with defects placed at fixed positions.

(b) Intrinsic versus emergent gauge charge

The dumbbell model has led us to the important distinction between two contributions to the
monopoles’ interactions. In fact, these two contributions correspond to two kinds of charges in
our system.
