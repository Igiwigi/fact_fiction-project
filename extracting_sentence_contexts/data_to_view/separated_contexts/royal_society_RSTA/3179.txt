The following hold for all L € R:

(i) Ai =0.
(ii) If dco > [IVloo, then Ag, =0. Remark 2.12. In fact, the proof will show that there are no crossings on I), or 4. This means
the result Aj, = A4, =0 is not due to cancellation. Proof. (i) This is equivalent to showing that the unstable subspace E" (—00, 4) of

_ On D1
A-@)= (1 4V_ Oh )

has trivial intersection with D for any 4 < 0.
