strength, which could lead to conservation laws that are not equivalent to those of the Anderson-localized orbitals.


are translation-invariant sums of local or quasi-local operators, where quasi-local means with
exponentially decaying support. For example, on a lattice a conserved quantity looks like

Q=>Â°Q;, (1.3)

where the Q; are local or quasi-local combinations of operators, and the effect of changing i is
simply a translation.

Free particle systems without disorder are examples of integrable systems of this type, but a
remarkable fact with deep implications across mathematical physics is that certain interactions
can be added in one spatial dimension without destroying the infinite list of independent
conserved quantities. Many physically important Hamiltonians are in this class: for example,
spinless bosons interacting with a 6-function interaction, or a spin-half chain with nearest-
neighbour Heisenberg interactions. As in the many-body-localized case, the focus here will be on =
how the existence of an infinite number of conserved quantities modifies important dynamical 3
phenomena in the system. : al

For the same reasons as before, we would expect the long-time state of the system to be a GGE mea)
