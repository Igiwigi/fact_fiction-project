Although
a Askp surA::kan double null strain was synthetic lethal in rich
media [28], the skp gene has not shown any genetic interactions
with components of the BAM complex. Still, Skp appears to
maintain uOMPs in a folding-competent, unfolded confor-
mation because a uOMP captured by a Skp protein and
subsequently presented with membranes will fold into those
bilayers in vitro [11,29]. Despite the fact that these details
are not well understood, it is clear that folding into outer
membranes in vivo involves the BAM complex. We have hypothesized that the main function of the BAM
complex should be to reduce the activation barrier to UOMP
folding at the inner surface of the outer membrane. This idea
originates in the observation that the phospholipid head
group composition in this membrane leaflet is similar to
that found in the outer leaflet of the inner membrane: it is
enriched in PE lipids, which are known to slow spontaneous
folding.
