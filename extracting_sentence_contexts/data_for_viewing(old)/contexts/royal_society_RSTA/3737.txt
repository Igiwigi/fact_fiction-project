PES was, then, the first point to investigate whether unimolecular dissociation kinetics can give
some explanation on the reactivity more than the mere analysis of energetics, in particular, related
to the observation that the Ca?+ product shows a high intensity. In the next subsection, we then
report the kinetic results.

(b) Statistical unimolecular dissociation

A simplified picture of the re-computed PES at the G96LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory (used in the
dynamics simulations) is shown in figure 5.

Then, we can obtain, per each elementary event, the RRKM rate constants (see §2a). For this,
one essential parameter is the internal energy of the reactant ion. This value is, in principle, not
known just from the experimental conditions: in fact the collision energy does not correspond
