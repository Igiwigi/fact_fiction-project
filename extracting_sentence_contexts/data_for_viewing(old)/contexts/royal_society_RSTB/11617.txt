matter what the fate of the corpse, the deceased person con-
tinues to exist elsewhere. The exact nature of that existence
and of that elsewhere may be ultimately unknowable but
when supplied with relevant testimony by the surrounding
culture, children will be led to construct a suitable mental rep-
resentation, just as they might do for a country they have never
visited or a phenomenon they have never observed [11].
Children have the ability to represent absent persons before
they have a comprehensive understanding of the biological
inevitability and finality of death. Thus, even toddlers can
think and talk about an absent attachment figure or anticipate
a future reunion [12]. Children’s emerging understanding of
death confronts them with the fact that a separation brought
about by death, unlike everyday separations, will be permanent
rather than temporary. Yet children’s continuing representation
of the deceased is likely to be based on their memory of inter-
actions with the living person—what Boyer [13] describes as
the person-file system—and not just on their memory or rep-
resentation of the insensate corpse. When children receive
testimony about the afterlife, they are effectively offered further
support for their representation of the ‘living person’ as exist-
ing elsewhere. He or she has departed this world for the


afterlife, be it with God, in the Kingdom of Heaven, or among Metaphorical talk about death might be restricted to adults. | 4 |
