polarised rings, which we owe to Dr. BrewsTeR, have es-
tablished the connection of the tints so polarised with the
force producing the deviation of the extraordinary pencil, and
shown the legitimacy of conclusions respecting the intensity
of the latter, drawn: from observations on the former:

This indirect mode of observation, which consists in notic-
ing the gradations of colour for different positions and thick-
nesses of the crystal, possesses three capital advantages. The
first is its extreme sensibility, which enables us to detect the
existence, and measure precisely the intensity of forces, far
too feeble to produce any measurable deviation of the extra-
ordinary pencil. It, in fact, affords the rare combination of an
almost indefinite enlargement of our scale of measurement,
with a possibility of applying it precisely to the object mea-
sured, arising from the distinctness of all its parts. Another,
no less precious, is the leading us by mere ocular inspection
to the /aws of very complicated phenomena, and enabling us
to form, and mould as it were our analytical formule, not on
a laborious, and sometimes deceptive discussion of tabulated
measures, but on the actual form of the curves themselves,
which are loci of the functions under consideration. It is
true, that a reference to tabulated measures is indispensible to
give precision to such first approximations ; but the power
this mode of observation affords of copying our outline fresh
