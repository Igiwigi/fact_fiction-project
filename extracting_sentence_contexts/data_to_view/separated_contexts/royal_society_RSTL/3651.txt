Lastly ap-
pears 3 with feeble traces of further irregular and interrupted action. Measure-
ments of these spots as they appear, leave no doubt of their identity in situation with
the thermic spots «, 3, y, 3 of Art. 136, and that they are referable to the drying of
the paper is shown by the fact, that a film of the liquid dried in a porcelain saucer
changes from green to dark brown at a definite point of dryness. Moreover, on
wetting the paper, the brown spots disappear, and in their place we find a train of
Prussian blue, of varying intensity, but of uniform breadth (not swelling and con-
tracting, as is the case with the heat-spots formed by simple drying, and therefore ob-
viously due to direct radiation), and terminating in two insulated and tolerably well-

defined circular spots or solar images, holding precisely the Fagan of y and 3 (viz. at
— 357 and — 451).
