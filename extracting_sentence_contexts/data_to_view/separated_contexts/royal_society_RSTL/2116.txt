there is reaſon to believe are the more immediate cauſe
of the conſolidation of all ſtones and marbles whatſo-
ever, and which do very much abound in ſea water. It would exceed the limits of this paper, were I to at-
tempt here to mention only a ſmall part of the various
facts that have come to my knowledge; and which have
convinced me, and I truſt, when offered fairly to the con-
fideration of others, will make it appear fully to all that
are attentive to theſe kind of reſearches, that there is, to
this very day, a formation of ſtone, and even of marble
itſelf, in certain places, in a much more perfe&t manner,
than has been generally conceived; and far beyond what
has been ſuppoſed, even by thoſe who have been ready
too haſtily to account for ſuch a proceſs merely in conſe-
quence of obſervations made on ſtalaQtitical.and ſuch like
ordinary concretions,

I ſhall not therefore preſume to trouble the Society, at
preſent, with any detail of the inquiries I have made re-
lating to that ſubjeR, though in reality they have been
the foundation of the obſervations made in this paper;
but ſhall confine my remarks merely to this one cu-
rious circumſtance; that wherever there is any indu-
ration and petrefaCtion of matter, from any cauſes what- _
ever, it is greatly haſtened in its Progreſs, and the conſo-
lidation is rendered much more compleat and firm by

mixture of any ſolution of that metal. This appears, in ſome degree, from the preſent ſpe-
cimen; where, near adjoining to the ring, and in the
portion of the fragment that has the largeſt impreſſion

balls, which were thus conſolidated. The fame concluſion alſo may be drawn, with {till
more appearance of its being well founded, from a very
remarkable piece of antiquity, which was diſcovered

about three years ago on the coaſt of Kent.
