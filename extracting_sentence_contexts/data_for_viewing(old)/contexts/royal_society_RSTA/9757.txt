the pressure, temperature, and hygrometrie state of the adjacent air.

The difticulties and uncertainties associated with the variations in the weight of a
water skin were, it is believed, successfully met and overcome by the simple device
which we now describe.

(6) B, Of the Methods used for the Removal of Water Skins—Some observers
may be considerably surprised to learn that anyone should attempt to weigh accurately
glass vessels without previously drying the air within the balance case in the usual
manner. This departure from a time-honoured, orthodox, and, as we shall try to show,
sometimes worse than useless custom, was, on our part, of deliberate design.

Let us consider the actual facts. As ordinarily practised, the air within a balance
case is dried by means of such substances as solid calcium chloride, sticks of caustic
potash or soda, phosphorus pentoxide, or by concentrated sulphuric acid contained in
shallow vessels placed upon the bottom of the case. Any of the substances named
will lap up the moisture in the lowest layers of air with great avidity ; but as the
density of air increases with the removal of moisture, and as an attempt is usually
made to maintain the temperature of the balance both uniform and steady, it will be
necessary to depend almost exclusively upon the inter-diffusion of the dry and damp
air for completing the removal of the moisture. Remembering the law governing
the rate of the diffusion of one gas into another, and that usually for our present
purpose we may take the ratio of the densities of ordinary and of dried air as 1/1°005,
it will be at once apparent that such a process is both lengthy and inconvenient.
