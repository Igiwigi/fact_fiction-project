I have had two or three instances before me of disease affecting the
ophthalmic branch of the fifth nerve, and producing total insensibility of the
eye and eyelids, without loss of vision ; whilst the eyelids continued to be

closed and the eyebrow to be moyed by the influence of the portio dura of the
seventh nerve. MR. BELL ON THE NERVES OF THE FACE. 321

Such are a few of the facts which have been reaped from a patient reliance
on the correctness of my first deductions, and I would now urge them in proof
of the importance of reasoning upon the anatomy. All these nerves have been
repeatedly divided, by almost every surgeon of eminence in the three kingdoms. Although some have performed the operation of dividing the nerves frequently,
and one eminent gentleman had done it six times on the face of the same man,
all these operations have been performed without giving rise to the suspicion
that these nerves bestowed different properties.
