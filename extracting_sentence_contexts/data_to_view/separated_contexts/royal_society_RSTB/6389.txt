The

of 304—the size of the original cells of the Axp.-line which we may estimate from the
slope of the curve—must therefore reproduce for a period of 7 months under very
favourable conditions before the cells obtain an average diameter of 94. Then a period
of 3 months follows when, as in Ditylum, environmental factors may induce some cells
to form auxospores. That the main factor again changes in the medium produced
by the rich growth of a culture may be concluded from the fact that whenever a new
subculture was made a period of reproduction by division followed varying from
12-28 days in relatively broad cells to 1-2 days in narrow cells approaching a size at
which division: stopped and the cells died. SOME MARINE PLANKTON DIATOMS 33

By transferring samples at frequent intervals (4—7 days) in fresh culture fluid it was
possible to eliminate the formation of auxospores in two lines for a period of 6 and
8 weeks respectively. The smaller the diameter of the cells the more difficult it becomes
to eliminate auxospore formation.
