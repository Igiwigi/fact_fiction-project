the directive action of the fibre, though, knowing the extreme feebleness of this
directive action, I was surprised to find it able to accomplish what the experiments
exhibited. The thought suggested itself, however, of snspending the bars with the
fibre vertical, in which position the latter could have no directive influence. Here
also, to my surprise, the directive action, though slightly weakened, was the same as
before; in the centre of the field the bars took up the axial position. Bars of sul-
pbur, wax, salt of bartshorn, and other diamagnetic substances were next examined :
they all acted in the same manner as the wood, and thus showed that the cause of
the rotation lay, not in the structure of the substances, but in the distribution of the
magnetic force around them. This distribution in fact was snch, that the straight
line which connected the centre of one pole with that of the opposite one was the line
of weakest force. On represents the distribution of electricity upon the surfaces of
conductors by regarding the tensions as ordinates, and erecting them from the points
to which they correspond, the steepness of the curve formed Ã¾by uniting the ends of
the ordinates being the measure of the increase or diminution of tension. Taking
the centre of the magnetic field as the origin, and drawing lines axial and equatorial ;
if we erect the magnetic tensions along these lines, we $hall find a steeper curve in
the equatorial than in the axial direction. This may be proved by suspending a bit
of carbonate of iron in the centre of the magnetic field ; on exciting the magnet, the
suspended body will not move to the nearest portion of the flat pole, though it may
be not more than a quarter of an inch distant, but will move equatorially towards the
edges, though they may be two inches distant. The little diamagnetic vars referred
