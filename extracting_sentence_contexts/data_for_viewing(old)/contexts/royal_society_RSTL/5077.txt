proved that the phenomena manifested during the period of the catamenia in women,
are closely connected with those observed during the time of heat or rut in quadru-
peds; and that both of these phenomena are dependent on one cause, namely, the
maturation of ovules. But while this hypothesis has been very generally admitted,
there is, I believe, a tendency in the minds of many physiologists of the present day,
to doubt whether the oyules 80 matured are eyer extruded from the ovary and carried
into the Fallopian tubes, without the stimulus of impregnation, or, at any rate, with-
out the congress of the male. In support of this view, or rather of these doubts, an
appeal is often made to the fact, that an ovule has never yet been detected in either
of the Fallopian tubes of a virgin, who has died during the period of the catamenia,
notwithstanding that many subjects have been examined, that most careful search
has been instituted, and that appearances have frequently been noticed indicating
the recent rupture of a Graafian follicle. In point of fact, it is imagined by those
who entertain such doubts, that the fecundation of the germ takes place while it is
within the Graafian follicle, and consequently, that if the ovule fails to be the
subject of impregnation it never quits the ovary, but perishes within its formative
vesicle. On the other hand, the researches of Brscyory have led him to enunciate a
law, the purport of which is the very reverse of the preceding ; for he says, that * the
oyules formed in the ovaries of females of the human species and of mammiferons
animals, undergo a periodical maturation, quite independently of the male seminal
fluid. At these periods, known as those of heat or the rut in animals, and menstrua-
tion in the human female, the ovules which have become mature, disengage them-
selves from the ovary and are extruded. If the union of the sexes takes place, the
ovule is fecundated by the direct action of the semen upon it. If no union of the
