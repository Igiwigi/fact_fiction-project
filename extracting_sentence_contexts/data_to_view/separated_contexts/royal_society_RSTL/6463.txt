Moreover, from section 35, we see that D(H) is equivalent to A We || to Oz,

BE || to Oy, Câ€” - [| to Oz, together with det (Q, I) ; and since the last line det (Q, H)

is perpendicular on the instantaneous axis Q, it follows that the resolved part of D,(H)
along the instantaneous axis equals

Ts = 45; + T2 B 46, + -C 2
But this must equal zero, smnce D,(H) equals zero, and since consequently its resolyed
part along any line is zero, Hence we have

I Bo LE =D.

Therefore
Aon! +Bo!+C#? is constant, equal, say, to A. . . . . (IL)
We have already seen that H is a line of constant direction ; and since its direction-
coxines are proportional to Awm,, Bo,, C., it follows that the plane whose moment has
direction-cosines which are propor ou to the last three quantities is a fixed plane. This plane is the invariable plane. From this fact and the two equations (T.) and (I1.),
PoixsoT's celebrated illustration of the motion of a body which rotates about a fixed
point may be easily deduced in the ordinary manner ; but it is unnecessary to discuss
the problem further, as it must be already sufficiently apparent that the body's motion
entirely depends upon the fact that I is a line of fixed length and direction.
