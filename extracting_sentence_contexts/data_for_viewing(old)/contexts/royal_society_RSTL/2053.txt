appears from many experiments related in the papers and inquiry aboye re-
ferred to, that exactly in proportion as we increase or impair the power of the
brain and spinal marrow, the functions of the ganglionic nerves are increased
or impaired ; till pointing out the brain and spinal marrow as the active, and
the nerves with their ganglions and plexuses as the passive parts of the sy-
stem ; and these observations come with the more weight because those who
have maintained that the ganglions supply neryous influence, haye not even
pretended to support their opinion by any facts directly bearing on the point.

If however it also appears from direct experiment that the ganglions and
plexuses are capable of influencing the power of the ganglionie nerves, inde-
pendently of any change induced on the brain and spinal marrow, however
improbable the fact may at first sight appear, we must admit that there is in
the former organs an additional source of the power possessed by those nerves.

It has been found that the action of the heart is immediately influenced by
agents, whether stimulants or sedatives affecting any considerable part either
of the brain or spinal marrow *#. Can its action, in like manner, be affected
by agents making their impression on the ganglions and plexuses? For the
purpose of determining this point, the following experiment was made, in
which Mr. CuTLEs, and Mr. FitzLp the well-known veterinary surgeon, were
80 good as to assist me, Mr. FizLp performing the operative part.

The heart continues to obey the effect of agents acting through the neryous
system for a certain time, after what we call death, that is, the remoyal of the
