normal is always the sign or the cause of pathological processes. We find the _
Mammalia, accordingly, provided with highly complex temperature - regulating
mechanisms, in possessing which they differ very sharply from the Amphibia.
While it might therefore be expected @ prior; that the Frog's heart is 80 constructed

as to work better at those warm temperatures at which the general nervo-muscular
apparatus of the animal is most active, and the calls upon the organs of nutrition
greatest, the discovery that such is actually the case and that the warmed hearts of |
Frogs beat quicker than cold, does nob justify us in forthwith concluding that the
Mammalian heart, placed in and adapted to the needs of an animal with only one
healthy temperature, would behave in like manner. This doubt concerning the
validity when extended to warm-blooded animals of arguments based on experiments
made with the hearts of Frogs is increased when we call to mind the fact that an
elevation, within physiological limits, of the temperature of the medium to which a
cold-blooded animal is exposed increases its tisxue metamorphoses, as evidenced by

a greater excretion of carbon oxide, while exactly the reverse is the case in respect

to the Mammal. Recalling the wonderful physiological adaptation of the organs of
animals to the conditions under which they live, we might almost expect that
increased temperature (not reaching pathological limits) of the blood carried to ib
would lead to a slowing of the beat of the Mammalian heart in correlation with
the diminished oxidations then occurring in the body generally, and its consequently
diminished nutritional demands.
