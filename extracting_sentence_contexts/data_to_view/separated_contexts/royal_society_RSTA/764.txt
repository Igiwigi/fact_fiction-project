The process has further
been implemented in KTP waveguides [17], which restrict the process to a single spatial mode
and increase the process efficiency due to the strong confinement along the whole propagation
length. This allowed one to generate mean photon numbers of 20 while maintaining the single-
mode character [18]. The fact that the single-mode states can be driven to such high mean
photon numbers suggests that strong squeezing in controlled temporal modes is feasible in such
waveguides. In this publication, we review the engineering of PDC and FC with the focus on integrated
devices. Restricting ourselves to waveguides, we do not consider spatial correlations and assume
that all processes happen in one spatial mode only.
