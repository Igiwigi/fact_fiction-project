The Born—Oppenheimer approximation is a cornerstone of chemistry that greatly simplifies
the analysis of molecular systems by defining electronic adiabatic states and confining the
system in one of these states. Nevertheless, this approximation regularly fails in describing
photochemistry, particularly in regions of the potential energy surfaces where the adiabatic states
become degenerate and form the commonly encountered conical intersections (CIs) [1,2]. Indeed,
the non-adiabatic couplings that are neglected in the Born-Oppenheimer approximation can
become arbitrarily large close to a CI [2-4] and break the Born—-Oppenheimer approximation.
In this case, one may believe that including the missing couplings should be sufficient to recover
the exact description, but this is not completely true. A first difficulty comes from the fact that the
non-adiabatic couplings diverge at the CIs. Hence, all the non-adiabatic coupling terms may not
be integrable over the chosen basis and can lead to numerical instabilities. Another difficulty is
that an extra geometric phase (GP) attached to the adiabatic states appears upon encircling the
Cls [5-8]. The GP implies that adiabatic states have a double-valued boundary condition when
revolving around the CI, and so must be the boundary condition on the nuclear wavepackets in
order to recover a single-valued total molecular wave function [6,9]. Overlooking this GP was
found to severely impact the resulting dynamics [10-14]. Not accounting for GP diminishes the
transition probability in internal conversion processes [15,16]. Even in a low energy regime, when
the nuclear wavepacket encircles but does not necessarily have enough energy to reach the CI,
the extra GP-induced interference causes appearance of a nodal plane in the nuclear wavepacket
[11,17,18] that can diminish population transfer around a CI or even localize the wavepacket on
one side of the CI [12,18-20].
