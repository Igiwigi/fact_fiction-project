It is noticwitle fioe the numbers given by Rawsdy and Srxmnps that with che
exception of veetic acid the complexity of the first four avids diminishes with rise ia
moleoulir weight, If the snomaloue position of the viscosity curves is due solely to
the effect of conmplusity, it is indicated that acetic atid is really no exeeptiion to this
rile, Tf, however, tie resvills obtained by the surfuce-atorgy wethod of estimuting
complexity are valid, it must be admitted that the anomulous position of the curve
for formic avid, with relation to that of acetic acid, is due to some peculiarity in (he
constitution of formic neid, which may be associated with the fact thut it is the initial
member of the homologous series, and does not contain a CH, or w CH, group.

Anhydrides.

Acetic anhydvide and propionic wuhydride were the only members of this serivg
which were examined. The curves obtained, together with that of propionic acid,
which is inserted for the sake of comparison, are given in fig. 16,
