perhaps, mention that with the 3-feet speculum in fine order I have often detected
resolvability when there was no trace of it with the 6-feet s8peculum in its ordinary
working-condition.

The question of resolvability, therefore, I think, must remain to be taken up separately,
when the finest instrumental means are available, and when it may no longer be neces-
8ary to subject the specula to the wear and tear of constant work.

As to the nebule which have nuclei, some are described as increasing in brightness
very gradually to the centre, others very rapidly, and some as having a stellar nucleus,
or perhaps a star in the centre. These descriptions, however accurately conveying the
impressions made upon the eye at the time, cannot be taken as in all cases representing
real physical facts. A star may have been mistaken for a condensed nucleus, or the
reverse ; and it is often impossible to 8ay which of the two suppositions is the more pro-
bable. The remarks as to the question of resolvability apply with equal force to the
questions relating to the structure of nuclei. It is, however, probably worth remarking,
that, while amongst the clusters there are objects which, if removed to a sufficient
distance, or examined with an instrument of insufficient power, may be supposed to be
representations of nebulte with centres of varying brightness or condensation, there seems
to be no cluster with a central star of such surpassing magnitude that under any circum-
stances it could be taken as the representative of the class of objects described as having
a star in the centre.
