surface alone, but throughout the whole interior of the fasciculus; and this is rigor-
ously the case. Owing to the transparency of the fasciculi, it is perfectly easy,
under a high power, to bring into focus whatever portion of their interior the observer
may choose. On bringing the surface nearest to him first into view, the points
noticed early in this paper usnally present themselves, and as the focus descends into
the interior, the strizz 8eem commonly to undergo a slight lateral motion, but con-

are suddenly lost, according to the thickness of the object. The slight motion side-
ways, which is 80 very generally observed, is of course merely a deception resulting
from the striz seen in succession at any one point not being all precisely in a plane
vertical to the observer, but slanting one way or the other from him, $0 that the
focus in following the slant seems to move aside. Though I am not aware that this
remarkable fact, of the existence of the strize throughout the fasciculus, has hitherto
been noticed by anatomists, it appears to me not only to be solely explicable by con-
8idering the strizz merely an appearance occasioned by the lateral cohesion of a bundle
of marked fibrillz, but also, in its turn, to be a proof amounting to demonstration,
that such is in reality their nature, As far as my experience goes, it is uniformly to
be observed wherever the striz are distinct, and it will be decisive in proportion to
the transparency and bulk of the fasciculus. Moreover, if the fibrillae happen to have
