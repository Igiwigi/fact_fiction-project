stroma eventually disappear in a manner that might be interpreted as indicating that
they are gathered up afresh into blood-vessels, but in the absence of a quite complete
series of stages I cannot be certain of this point. But it is evident that they do not
become transformed into pigment as with the sheep. A new (or partly new) epithelial
layer, composed of flattened cells, is formed during recuperation, and in an early
stage of this period I have observed its mode of formation from adjoining epithelial
cells in spots where the stroma was still bare. Whether or not at a still earlier stage
any portion of the epithelium is renewed from the underlying tissue, as described to
be the case for monkeys by Mr. Heape (1894, 1897), I am unable to say positively,
but the relation between certain tracts of epithelium and the adjoining stroma
suggests the correctness of this view in the case of the ferret.

It is clear from the facts summarised in the preceding paragraphs that all the stages
into which Mr. Huare first divided the menstrual cycle of Semnopithecus are repre-
sented in the oestrous cycle of the bitch (RETrERER, 1892), and in that of the ferret,
with the exception of Stage VII. (the formation of the menstrual clot), the characters
of which in the case of the latter animals are only partially recognisable. It is
apparent also that the procestrous process in the carnivore, in regard to its severity,
is approximately intermediate between that of the sheep, as described above, and the
menstruation of monkeys, as worked out fully by Mr, Heare. But the cstrous
cycle of the ferret differs both from the dicestrous cycle of the sheep and from the
menstrual cycle in the Primates in its far more extended duration.
