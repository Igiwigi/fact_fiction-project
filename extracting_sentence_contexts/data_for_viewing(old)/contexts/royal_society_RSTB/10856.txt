Given that FACT is essential for both transcription and DNA
replication in higher organisms, similar processes are likely to
be at work in human cells [61-63].

To ensure R-loop removal where prevention mechanisms
fail, a number of enzymes exist that can specifically degrade
or unwind RNA:DNA hybrids. R-loop degradation lar-
gely depends on the ribonucleases RNase H1 and 2, which
specifically recognize long and short RNA:DNA hybrids,
respectively, and enzymatically degrade the RNA component
to restore dsDNA [64]. RNase H enzymes are highly evolutiona-
rily conserved and their depletion is embryonically lethal in
mammals, underlining their importance for accurate genome
