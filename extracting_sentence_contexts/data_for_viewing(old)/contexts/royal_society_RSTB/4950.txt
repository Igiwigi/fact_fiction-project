of the amount of diffusion in the nest is more a question of order of magnitude than of
numerical accuracy.

This completes the data required for solving equation (1), which may now be written :

Wy = 42 0-27h (8, — 82)
= 42 0-27.1-6.7-7 (1 — 0-56) 1-06. 10-° 60 60 24

= 1-7 grammes H,0 per 24 hours from 13 eggs.

1-7/4-83 or 0°35 is the heading of the third column in Table XIX., and is, of course,
for a nest bounded top and bottom by the continuous tin surfaces. The hen’s nest
differs from this mainly in the fact that while its lower surface is also continuous the
upper one is not, except in the central region. Wings and legs are no doubt utilised
as far as possible in covering the eggs, but it is chiefly by their feathers that they do

so; and the effect of this must be to increase enormously the facilities for both diffusion
and convection in the outer portions of the nest.

It is quite certain, therefore, that we may rule out the column headed 0-35 (and
a fortiori that headed 0-00) as the amount of diffusion on which it was calculated was
much too small. It is also probable that an appreciable amount of convection in the
