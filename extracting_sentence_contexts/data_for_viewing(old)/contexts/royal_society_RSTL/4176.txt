descent throughout. I ought to add, that with the point of coke, the luminous arc
was $0 brilliant that the blue light which I have mentioned almost entirely disap-
peared, which was not the case with any other kind of point.

Leaving the plate of platinum, I adjusted a zinc point. The effects were most
brilliant, but of short duration, the point speedily melting. In common air, a deposit
of white oxide was precipitated upon the platinum plate ; in highly rarefied air (the
vacuum of an air-pump), a black deposit was formed : in both cases it commu-
nicated with the positive pole. An iron point being substituted for that of zine,
equally produced in common air a brownish red deposit of oxide of iron, and in
rarefied air a deposit of black oxide.

I call the attention of chemists to these two facts, as well as that of the oxidation

of the platinum at a high temperature in rarefied air, They appear to prove the in-
fluence which the state of greater or less density of the surrounding oxygen may exert
on the phenomenon of oxidation and on the nature of the oxide formed. A plate *
and a point of soft iron were used as positive and negative electrodes, both in a va-
cuum and in the atmosphere,; the same results appeared with a plate and a point of
silyer, a plate and a point of copper, and a plate and point of argentane*#. The blue
