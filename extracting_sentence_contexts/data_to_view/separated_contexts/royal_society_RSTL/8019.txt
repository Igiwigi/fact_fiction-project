No one example of a large stem has been found presenting exactly the same structure
as these small branches, which, as already stated, are 80 abundant. On the other hand,

- all the Diplozylons are large branches or matured stems. These facts at once suggested

the inquiry whether the two plants referred to might not be complementary to each

other. A careful and very extended study of a large number of specimens has con-

vinced me that such is the case. I have made more than a hundred sections of the

two forms, and the result has been a remarkably clear testimony that the Lepidodendre

are the twigs and young branches of the Diplozylon-stems.
