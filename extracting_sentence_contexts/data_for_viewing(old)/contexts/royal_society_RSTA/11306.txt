apparatus unscreened, and with a sereen of black paper in front of the quartz plate.
The black paper was removed immediately after the expansion, to enable the drops to
be seen.

The pressure fall being 174 millims., the drops were very few when the black paper
was interposed, while a fog resulted when the expansion was made without the
screen.

Similar experiments, made with a glass screen interposed, the expansion being the
same as before, showed again a very marked difference between the results of
expansions made with and without the black paper screen.

The difference is, in fact, more marked than that between the showers or fogs
obtained with and without the glass screen.

It is plain, therefore, that sunlight, unlike the light from the other sources tried,
contains nucleus-producing rays which can penetrate glass.

The black paper and the window-glass screen were now removed, and expansions of
the same amount as before made with a red glass screen interposed. Only a few
drops were produced. On substituting a screen of blue glass, a fog was obtained
under the same conditions. These active rays can thus penetrate blue glass, but not
red glass.

In connection with the above results it is of interest to notice that Exsrer and
