One can use the renewal
approach as described above (also see [7]) to show that the probability density function (PDF) has
a stationary solution. In particular, the PDF with resetting (r > 0) can be written as

t
P,(x, fxg) =e" Po(x, tlxo) + r| e~™ P(x, u|xo) du, (2.5)
0

where P(x, t|x) is the PDF of the reset-free (r = 0) income dynamics [28,29]

By Laplace transform, L[f(#)]=Jo° eS{f(t) dt =f(s), of equation (2.5), and by using the limit
s— 0, we find the steady state, P}>(x|xo) = limp oo P;(x, t|xo) = lim, o sP,(x, tlxo) = rPo(x, r\xo)-



Following this, it can be shown that the stationary distribution follows a power law,

is the shape parameter. The power law property is an important stylized fact that is prevalent
in real-world income distributions [30,31]. Other stylized facts that are recovered by the model
are larger yz (larger average population growth), larger o (more randomness in the dynamics)
and/ or smaller r (less retiring or layoffs), result in a smaller shape parameter and a heavier-tailed
distribution. This leads to higher inequality and lower mobility in the economy.
