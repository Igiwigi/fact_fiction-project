system. I have, however, merely shown that they act as pumps sucking blood in and
forcing it out. They will only be effective in the circulation if there is a means of ensuring
a one-way passage of blood through their vessels. I have not found any actual valves in
the limbs of the nature of the scutal or rostral valves, but I do not think this is necessary.
On the one side of the limbs is the epineural sinus constantly fed from the gut parenchyma,
with blood which can only escape up the afferent vessels of the cirri. On the other are the
lateral blood spaces which are constantly being emptied into the dorsal blood space and so
to the blood pump. Clearly then there must be high pressure on the afferent side and low

pressure on the efferent, and this in itself is sufficient to ensure a passage in one direction
through the cirri. However, even if the pressure on both sides of the cirrus were the same,
there is, I think, in the basis of the limb, a beautiful adaptation which, though not struc-
turally a valve of the usual type, must in fact act as one when the limbs are being cast.
In transverse sections (figure 8) it will be seen that the afferent vessel occupies the whole
of a cavity of a ridge on the inner edge of the basal joint, and is separated from the muscle
and the parenchyma by a very definite wall of connective tissue. On the other hand, the
efferent vessel is embedded in a mass of parenchyma. Now on full extension of the limb,
both vessels will be full of blood. On contraction of the limb, the muscle throughout its
length will shorten and hence become broader. In the joints of the basis this broadening
of the muscle will press laterally and tend to compress the blood vessels. But the afferent
vessel is protected by its screen of connective tissue and so the whole of the pressure will
be concentrated through the hydraulic parenchyma on to the efferent vessel. Now the
contained blood has two ways out, either by the cirrus or into the body. Passing up the
