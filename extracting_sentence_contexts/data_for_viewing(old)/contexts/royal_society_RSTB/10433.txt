stolonoid parasitic phase suggesting that the Myxozoa/Poly-
podium clade might be sister to Hydrozoa, as some trees
indicate [77]. Myxozoan branches on multiprotein trees that
show them as sister instead to all other Medusozoa [1]
might have put them artefactually one node too deep, but
they could reasonably be genuine sisters of all Medusozoa,
as the polyp-like free-living adult has an apparently primitive
nerve net [77], as expected if its ancestor evolved directly
from a stem anthozoan and its traditional assignment to
Medusozoa were incorrect.

Others advocate one neural origin and invoke tree arte-
facts, giving more supporting details [78]. Saying synaptic
origin ‘might occur more than once during ~600 million
years of animal evolution’ [79, p. 607] is 100-fold misleading;
fossil ctenophores and cnidaria originated essentially simul-
taneously (Ctenophora 540 Ma [80]; Cnidaria 560 Ma [81])
as sequence trees’ close branching and poor resolution con-
firm. It was no coincidence; benthic nematocystous
anthozoa and pelagic ctenophores likely diverged within
5 Ma of synaptic origin (a complex arguably unique inno-
vation), divergently perfecting benthic tentacular feeding
(Cnidaria) or pelagic ciliary current feeding (Ctenophora)
by amplifying and recruiting partially different subsets of
the choanozoan/sponge protein repertoire. Cambrian cteno-
