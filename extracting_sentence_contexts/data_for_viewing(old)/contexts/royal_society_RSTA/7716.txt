Over 120 independent determinations have been made during the last five years.
They are plotted in fig. 11 and are grouped according to the time at which they
were made and the resistor which was employed. The figures in circles indicate
the number of observations in each group, the other figures the mean deviation
in parts per million. It is usually possible to make two determinations in a day, and
each group represents a relatively short interval of time, from one to four weeks.
The last group, of 16 observations, is an exception. In this case the observations
were spread over more than four months, and the conditions were purposely changed
in several respects. For example, in a few determinations one coil system only was
used, in order that the conditions might approximate to those obtaining in the
current balance of the National Bureau of Standards, in which the system of coils
is not duplicated. The fact that the mean deviation from their mean of the results
of this group is only two parts in a million shows that the current balance repeats
to a high order of accuracy. It will be recalled that the electromagnetic force is
only 4 gm.-wt., whereas the beam, suspended coils, and fittings weigh over 14 kg.

Repetition over an interval of a few years has not proved so satisfactory, and
deserves some discussion. All the results plotted in fig. 11 are referred to the
instrument constant calculated from the linear dimensions measured at the end of
