true a broad irregular band of tabular cells, surrounding the sporogenous groups,
becomes disorganised, but without assuming the glandular characters usual for a
tapetum, On the other hand, a large number of cells of the sporogenous groups in
these plants act like a diffused tapetum, becoming absorbed during the development
of the spores ; this fact may have its bearing on the absence of a definite tapetal
layer outside. In quisetum, however, both a diffused tapetum of this nature is
found, and a definite single-layered tapetum, which originates outside the sporogenous
group.* The large spores are thus amply provided for.. A tapetum originating
outside the sporogenous group is found in Lycopodium,+ Phylloglossum,t the Marat-
tiaceve,§ and in Helminthostachys|| and Botrychium. In the two genera first named it
is a definite layer; in the Marattiaceze it is an indefinite band of cells of tabular form,
not a single definite layer. But in Selaginella,1 at any rate for the most part, the
tapetum is cut off from the sporogenous group itself. The case of Isoetes is peculiar,
and shows how indefinite the origin of a functional tapetum may be... In the
microsporangia the tapetum “is organised out of that layer of the sterile cells,
whether of wall or of trabeculee, which is in contact with the fertile cells ;** it
remains persistent till the maturity of the spores. In the megasporangium “the
