'= The rigorous method of discussing the stability of the system having failed, certain
‘considerations are adduced in § 11 which bear on the conditions under which there is
form of equilibrium consisting of two fluid masses in close promixity. It appears
that there cannot be such a form with the two masses just in contact, unless the
Zsmaller of the two masses exceeds in mass about one-thirtieth of the larger. = If we take into consideration the fact that the criterion of the applicability of
Sharmonic analysis is too severe, it appears to be worth while to find to what results Ethe analysis leads when two masses, one 27 times as great as the other, are brought
gelose together.. The numerical work of the calculation is omitted, since the numbers
Ecan only represent the true conclusion very roughly ; but the result is illustrated
B graphically in figs.
