respectively; V is the particle volume. The random forces which model thermal noise in the
system, in accordance with the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, are defined by the following
correlation relations [26,27]:

(Via (t)yj,p(t + T)) = 2T a SoB5jj5(7). (3.3)

Hereinafter temperature is measured in energy units (kg = 1).

In the set (3.1) vector Q renders the retarded part of the reaction of the medium. It resembles
the torque exerted on the particle on the part of the dynamic network, whose nodes dwell for
time of the order of ty. As is seen from set (3.1) and is illustrated by figure 1, in the Jeffreys model
the mechanisms of retarded and usual friction work in parallel. Note that with this arrangement
one may, in fact, access even the case of a chemical network in a good solvent (a gel) setting ty >
oo. In this limit, the torque equation simplifies to Q=—K@ meaning that the high-molecular
component responds in a purely elastic way. For such a system in the case of plane rotation of
particles (i.e. discs) equations (3.1) reduce to a one-dimensional Kelvin model; this situation was
analysed in [29].

The set of stochastic equations (3.1) via a standard procedure [27,30] may be transformed to
a kinetic equation of the Fokker—Planck type (FPE) for the orientational distribution function
We, Q, t); one of its plausible forms is
