'= warmth of the wool was to that of the woollen thread only as
Z 426 to 410; and in the experiments with lint, and with linen
2 thread, when the heat was much abated, the covering of the
Â£ thread appeared to be even warmer than that of the lint,
6 though in the beginning of the experiments, when the heat
5 was much greater, the lint was warmer than the thread, in the
z proportion of 80 to 46.

From hence it should seem that a covering may, under cer-
tain circumstances, be very good for confining small degrees of
warmth, which would be but very indifferent when made use
of for confining a more intense heat, and vice versa. This, I
believe, is a new fact ; and, I think the knowledge of it may

lead to further discoveries relative to the causes of the warmth
of coverings, or the manner in which heat makes its passage
through them. But I forbear to enlarge upon this subject, till
I 5hall have given an account of several other experiments,
which I think throw more light upon it, and which will con-
sequently render the investigation easier and more satis-
factory.
