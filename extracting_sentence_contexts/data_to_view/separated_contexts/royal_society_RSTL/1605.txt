But, as all these toge-
ther never but once amounted to 2”, I think it may fairly be
presumed that that is the greatest error that will arise, in any
observation made with this circle, when only one mi-
croscope is used, and that probably only half that error will
take place. + How extremely small a quantity this is, may be seen by considering that, on a

radius of two feet, an arc

of 1o' amounts only to - - - - 0,0698 inch, Of I —— - - - - 0,0070

of 1” to (= in round numbers to about yZ;; inch,) 0,000116
Viz, to about 8 times less than the minimum visibile to the naked eye, This 1
reckon, with my own eye, at 8+ inches distance, is about 7&7; inch ; but then it must
be considered that the microscopes magnify 16 times, and will therefore render a space
visible that is 3355 inch, or about = 0, which we shall s0on find to be the fact,


of the Equatorial Instrument. 99 After this examination of the equatorial circle at every 10},
I did not think it necessary to proceed in the examination of
each degree, and till less of every 10', as I had intended.
