Thus the classical concept is not only dualistic, but has to admit a class of as many
extraneous relations as there are members of the class of particles.

Instead of the specific relations of occupation for the various particles, one general
triadic relation of occupation can be considered. Thus, O'(pAt) may be considered as
the statement the particle p occupies the point A at the instant 4. Then for any
given A and ¢ there is either one only or no particle p for which O'(pAt) is true.
Then the laws of physics are the properties of this single extraneous relation O.
But the use of this single relation apparently introduces no real simplification,
differing in this respect from the use of the essential relation which so simplifies the
statement of the axioms of geometry. The general relation O remains a mere alter-
native statement of the facts respecting the various specific relations of occupation.

Concept I[.—This concept is a monistic variant of the classical concept suggested
by Russetx.* In the classical concept the particles only occur as terms in the
triadic extraneous relations. If we abolish the particles (in the “ classical” sense),
and transform the extraneous relations into dyadic relations between points of space
and instants of time, everything will proceed exactly as in the classical concept.
The reason for the original introduction of “ matter” was, without doubt, to give the
senses something to perceive. If a relation can be perceived, this Concept I. has
every advantage over the classical concept. Otherwise the material world, as thus
conceived, would appear to labour under the defect that it can never be perceived.
But this is a philosophic question with which we have no concern.
