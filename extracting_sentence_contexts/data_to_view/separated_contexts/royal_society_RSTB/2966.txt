This is also shown by the fact that the sound main trunk of an ordinary
tree never snaps under wind pressure, and that stems completely hollowed out at
their bases, but not above, may remain erect for 100 years or more. Hence the
continued formation of new wood is not so much for mechanical requirements, as in
order to maintain good channels for the conveyance of water, that is, channels which
contain active living elements. The general rule may, in fact, be formulated, that
the more rapid the growth of an erect tree, the more slender will be its stem in
regard to its height, and that slowly-growing trees will have relatively bulky stems. This is strikingly shown in the Tropics by palms, by such trees as Albizzia, etc., and
by bamboos. The stem of the giant bamboo may attain a height of 60 metres, while
not more than 40 centims.
