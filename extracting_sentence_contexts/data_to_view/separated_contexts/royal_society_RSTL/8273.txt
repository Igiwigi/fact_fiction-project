But if they
be 80, then the greater part of them must be hermetically sealed up from water, or, by
hypothesis, we should have volcanoes dotted all over the earth ; and this last is equally
true as applicable to SCHALER'S liquid zone or a wriversad liquid nucleus. 220. Along such lines of volcanoes one vent or another may start into activity,
according as the crushing energy beneath supplies more heat and pulverized material
than another; and we find an explanation for the observed (or supposed to be obseryed)
fact without calling in the very crude notion that one volcanic vent relieves another, all
drawing from a. common fiery ocean or from lakes beneath. ,
