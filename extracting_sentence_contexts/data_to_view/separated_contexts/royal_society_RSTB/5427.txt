None of the seven features enumerated above is present in the Insectivores, except
the ala hypochiasmatica in Erinaceus and the paracondylar process in Talpa, each
of which structures is reduced in these forms. On the other hand, features 3, 4, 5 and
6 are present in the Primates. These facts suggest the following conclusions :â€”

The possession of the seven features enumerated shows that the Rodents are a
primitive type, which diverged at an early date from the main stem of mammalian
descent. The absence of these features from the present-day Insectivores shows that
they have undergone specialisation and have departed considerably from the conditions
which presumably obtained in the primitive Insectivore type. The presence of four
of these features in the Primate is evidence of the primitive nature of that group.
