Vax TreGne he at once replied, expressing his conviction that
they belonged to a Lycopodiaceons plant.*

It is now fully establisghed that Stygmaria ficoides, to which these rootlets belong, is
the root of Sigillaria, as well as of Lepidodendron. The structure of these rootlets
therefore adds an additional link to the long chain of evidence, indicating the close
affinity of the Sigillarie with the Lycopods. But there is yet another feature in these exogenous Lepidodendroid stems which
may prove to have some bearing upon the problem of evolution : this is, the presence
of numerous barred cells in the medullary rays, to which fact T have already made a
slight reference. In my memoir, Part II. (Plate 27, fig. 23, a, p. 236), I called atten-
tion to the existence of snch cells in the triangular spaces that appear to project out-
wards from the medullary sheath, and are intercalated between the inner extremities
of the vascular wedges of the exogenous zone ; and in the same memoir (p. 238) I
further pointed out that s8uch cells entered into the composition of the medullary rays. This is not only the case with the Arran plant described in my las memoir, but I now
discover them to be abundant in the various exogenous states of Lepidodendron
8elaginoides, and to be especially conspicuous in the peripheral layers of the more
matured branches.
