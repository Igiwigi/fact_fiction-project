498 MR. HARRIS ON THE INFLUENCE OF SCREENS

3. From this cireumstance, it seemed not unreasonable to infer, as was snb-
sequently proved by the fact, that a screening power might possibly be ob-
tained in a similar way, by means of substances not containing iron, proyided
snch snbstances were employed in large masses, and were in any degree 8us-
ceptible of a transient magnetic state ; notwithstanding that from the few
experiments hitherto tried, it was rather to be inferred that 8nch substances
were deficient in this peculiar property®,

4. After a few unsnecessful attempts, I succeeded in making the screening
power of seyeral substances, not supposed to contain iron, very evident ; the
mechanical arrangements resorted to for the purpose were similar to those
already described in my paper on the transient magnetic state, of which 8ub-
stances are susceptible, and which has been honoured by a place in the Royal
Society's Transactions; it will be unnecessary therefore to describe them
again ; they will however be easily understood in the detail of the following
experiments,
