or as a result of slow time variation.

3. Derivation of the equation of motion for a vortex

(a) Rayleigh—Jansen expansion of the global solution in the vortical region and time
dependence

Motivated by the discussion above, we consider a modified version of the Rayleigh—-Jansen
expansion in the form

o(t,2,2) = do(t,z) + M? log Mgx (t, z) + M?go(t,z,2) +++, (3.1)

where the arguments of the two first terms reflect the fact that they correspond to incompressible
flow in the vortical region, since from (2.2) we have V7 69 = V7¢1 =0. The governing equation
for $2,

ar Ax; AX{Ot — AX; AX; Ax{Ox;"

Vb (3.2)
does not contain y.

Define a complex potential Fo = ¢9 + io, since the flow at leading order is incompressible and
irrotational. Similarly, there is a complex potential F; = ¢; + iy. These potentials are harmonic
