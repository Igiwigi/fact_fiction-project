I therefore propose the name of Lake Harrison. In doing so, I am putting a

less well-known geologist in the distinguished company of Agassiz and Lapworth, but
a prophet need not be without honour in his own country. To give precision to Lake Harrison, we need to know as much as possible about two
series of facts—the height or heights of its surface and the shape of its floor.

(b) The height of Lake Harrison

The surface of a lake is the highest level to which its own under-water deposits can
reach. If, therefore, we leave out of consideration such formations as the Dunsmore gravel
which might have been spread out on dry ground, or till which is largely independent of
height, there remain such beds as the Wolston sand which quite probably was a deposit
of shallow water and the stoneless clays and related beds of the Wolston Series which were
certainly accumulated in the lake. Material laid down in the centre of the lake may never
have reached to the top water level, while, in addition, such central deposits are likely to
have been thicker than those on the margin and hence will have suffered more subsequent
compaction.
