This will necessitate investigation of what happens when — = 0, when discontinuities
would generally be introduced. As, however, we shall deal solely with the region far
away from the origin, ~ cannot be zero without 7 being large, and, save in exceptional
cases which will be discussed, the exponential factors will of themselves ensure that all
continuity conditions are satisfied. In fact, the right-hand sides of equation (3.531) will
only be sensible in the “ tail ” behind the obstacle, where & will be very large and y will
usually be finite. It is only in the process of adjusting discontinuities in this tail that
solutions which remain finite elsewhere may make their appearance. The transformations of the space-differential coefficients are put down here for
reference.
