Tt must be observed, however, that although the form of the pedal of a curve (C) is
inyariable, its volume must be differently estimated according to the nature of the two-
dimensional surface (S') of which the curye is supposed to form the contour. To render
this more evident, it will be convenient to regard the pedal of a curye, not only as the
envelope of a sphere, but also as the locus of a circle whose magnitude yaries at the
same time that its plane rotates about a fixed point, the pedal-origin. This circle, in
fact, is the characteristic of the pedal; its plane is perpendicular to the tangent at a
point M on the curve (C), and its chords, though the origin, are the perpendiculars upon
the 8everal tangent planes of (S') at the point M of its contour. Remembering now the convention of art. $ with respect to the signs of these perpen-
diculars, and the relation between the same and those of the corresponding yolume-
elements, we easily conclude that the volume of the pedal (P) will be the difference of
the yolumes of the surfaces generated by the segments into which the characteristic
circle is divided by the perpendicular p' upon the ordinary tangent plane of (S') at the
point M of its contour. The most interesting case, and the only one we shall examine further, is when the
surface (S') coincides with the developable of which (C) is the cuspidal edge.
