this point, and I have myself often detected considerable variation between examples
of red which normal-eyed people have declared to correspond. TI believe, however, that
the pigment carmine is usually understood to be the best artificial representation that
can be had of the true unmixed colour.

Now this red is by no means invisible to me; it conveys a very marked sensation of
colour, by which I am perfectly able to identify, in a great number of instances, bodies
of this hue. Tf therefore my testimony ended here, there would be no reason for
inferring that I am blind to red, or have much defect in my vision regarding it. But
when I examine more closely what I do really see in the cases referred to, I am obliged
to come to the conclusion that the sensation I perceive is not one that I can identify
separately, but is simply a modification of one of my other sensations, namely yellow.
It is in fact yellow shaded with black or grey—a dark yellow.

This I can prove to myself in several ways. First, I find that among the various tones
in the gamme of yellow, there is one, namely that numbered 16, which perfectly matches,
to my eye, the © rouge” in the circle: Secondly, I can make very nearly this appearance
of red to my eye, by mixing 1 part by measure of lampblack with 5 or 6* of chrome-
yellow powder, 80 as to darken it to the required tone. And thirdly, I can produce, on
Mr. MaxweLL's colour-top, a tolerable match to the carmine card, by a combination of
about 90 parts black with 10 parts chrome.

12. It may be safely stated, therefore, that what is ordinarily called red, is distinctly
visible to my colour-blind eye, not as an individual colour, but as a shade of yellow.
