the Survey. The application of the theory professed, indeed, to be simply a first att
from which we were entitled to expect little more than a rough approximation. Vie
in this light (and it must be remembered that this was all that the author himself claim
for it), its publication could only be regarded as strengthening the grounds on which t
Aesire was felt for more complete and trustworthy data than were possessed by M. G
in 1839. The failure of the theory, as provisionally applied, to reproduce in the South
Hemisphere the peculiar and characteristic features of the Terrestrial Magnetism whic
were so well establisghed by observation and represented by the theory in the Northez
Hemisphere, and the strong objection to receiving on less than conclusive evidence 8
improbable an anomaly as this diversity in the two hemispheres, tended, withc
doubt, greatly to stimulate the endeayours of those who desired to render the facts «
observation in the Southern Hemisphere more commensurate with the theory in which
they were to be employed. Accordingly in the VI.th Number of the Contributions (Phi
losophical Transactions, 1844, Art. VII.) I exhibited in Plate XIII. the lines of equ
intensity deduced from the observations in the first, two years of Sir James Ross's Survey,
in comparison with Gauss's theoretical lines taken from Plates XVIII. and XIX. of th
*Atlas des Erdmagnetismus,” showing the difference between the two. The immediate
object of this comparison was to strengthen the application which was then being made
for the additional employment of the * Pagoda; * whilst the two following sentences
which I venture to extract from the paper accompanying the Plate, are sufficient to:
manifest that a full respect for the theory itself and for its illustrious author was nd
wanting.
