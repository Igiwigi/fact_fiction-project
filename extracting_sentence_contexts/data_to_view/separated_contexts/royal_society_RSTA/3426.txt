Nevertheless, this tremendous mass loss is observed and is likely to be
important in the evolution of massive stars.

(b) Problems with the traditional view

There is mounting evidence that this fairly well-defined picture of LBVs may be unravelling,
since several of these hallmarks have not stood the test of time. Continued study has shown that
rigid imposition of definitions of LBVs [7] has not been supported by detailed analysis on several

fronts, and these definitions would in fact exclude most LBVs from the class. In particular, the
important conjecture that S Dor variations are caused by optically thick winds at constant Lgoi
may be wrong, and steady super-Eddington winds may not be the correct or dominant driving
mechanism in many giant LBV eruptions (see review by Smith [1]). Studies with quantitative spectroscopy [15-18] have disproven the conjecture that S Doradus
brightening events are caused by developing pseudo-photospheres in optically thick winds, as
suggested initially by Davidson [11] and reviewed by HD94 [7].
