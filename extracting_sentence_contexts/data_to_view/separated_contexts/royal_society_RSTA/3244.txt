Similarly, the pre-dried 55K2CO3-45MgCO; starting material mix used in our experiments
absorbed up to 0.8 w% H2O in only 15 min at atmospheric conditions. Since the carbonate powder
prior to loading into pre-experimental noble metal containers and the synthesized glasses are
both sensitive to atmospheric moisture absorption, we have taken great care to minimize this risk

by analysing the run charges directly after opening the sample containing capsules as well as
immediately after the performed DSC analyses. Nevertheless, the nominally anhydrous carbonate glasses of experiments KMG4 and KMG8
(no water initially added) yielded 0.8 and 0.24 wt% HO, respectively (tables 1 and 2). The uptake
of atmospheric moisture is hence unavoidable in such strongly hygroscopic chemical systems and
even when keeping the time in between the individual pre- and post-experimental preparation
steps to a minimum, sample hydration resulting in up to 0.8 wt% bulk H2O contents cannot
entirely be circumvented.
