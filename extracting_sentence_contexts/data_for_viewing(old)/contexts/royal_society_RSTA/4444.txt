to the level of Mg in the Mg,Co3_,Og (figure 6c), suggesting that the higher temperatures are
causing Mg to migrate away from Co, causing a reduction in the poisoning effect of Mg.

During the high-temperature phase of the test at 230째C and then 240째C, the site-time yields of
all the catalysts except AWS increase relative to the 0% Mg standard sample, to the extent that,
by 240째C, AW4 has a higher site-time yield than the standard, while AW3 is the same within
error (figure 6b). Again, the relative increase in site-time yield is somewhat correlated to the level
of Mg in the Mg,Co3_,Oy4, although as the yields fall back below those of the standard when
returning to 210째C, this effect cannot be entirely due to a high-temperature activation process and
must be at least somewhat an intrinsic property of Mg promotion. Arrhenius plots for the 0% Mg
standard, AW3 and AW4 (electronic supplementary material, figure S11) show no deviation from
a linear trend at the highest temperature, which also indicates that there is no large change in
the number of active sites. The fact that it is AW4, in which x in Mg,Co3_,Og is only 0.01, which
shows the largest increase in site-time yield with temperature raises the interesting prospect that
the improved high-temperature performance is due to Mg incorporated into the alumina phase.

Looking at the selectivity of the samples (figure 6d), there is a consistent correlation between
selectivity for all products and conversion among all samples at all temperatures, strongly
suggesting that Mg in any form is not having a detectable influence on the selectivity or on the
relative rates of possible competing reactions such as water gas shift.

4. Conclusion

The fact that magnesium is incorporated into the cobalt oxide spinel phase as well as the alumina
phase despite the high-temperature treatment before impregnation has important implications for
