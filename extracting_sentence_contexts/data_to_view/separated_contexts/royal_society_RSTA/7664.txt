The minimum resultant is now
cos v’ instead of 1/,/2, and the initial drop is much less, with a correspondingly smaller
value of h,,;,- On the scale on which the curves are drawn in fig. 8 the effect is there-
fore negligible, except on the longer waves over sea, and we would not expect to be
able to detect the effect experimentally. Since |7| increases as ¢ and A decrease, the initial parts of the curves in fig. 8 get
steeper as the wave-length is decreased, and the over land curves are much steeper than
the over sea ones. This is equivalent to the fact that the ground attenuation due to earth
losses increases rapidly with decreasing ¢ and A. By using the reciprocal theorem the analysis applies as well to the case when the
receiver is on the ground and the transmitter is elevated. By combining both cases the
effect of having both the transmitter and receiver elevated can be calculated.
