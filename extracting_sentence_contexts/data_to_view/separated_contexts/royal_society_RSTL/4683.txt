Again, in the
case of five other stars, viz. y Arietis, @? Cancri, 178 (Bode) Libre, 100 Herculis and
579 Struve, the components are of equal magnitude, and parallax is in this case not
only & priori highly improbable, but there is nothing in the actual observations them-
selves of these stars, which can lead us to any definite conclusion as to its existence
in fact. It is proper, however, to direct attention to the large differences in the case
of 9? Cancri, accordant in respect of sign.
