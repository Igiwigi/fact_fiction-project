The material still possesses elasticity because it shrinks as the load is removed, but
the elasticity is imperfect in the sense that change of length is no longer proportional
to change of load.

But, if the metal is iron or mild steel, proportional elasticity is slowly recovered

with time; and this change from unproportional to proportional elasticity or from
imperfect to perfect elasticity is accelerated by boiling.

In fact overstrained iron or mild steel is restored to its perfect or proportional
elastic state with remarkable rapidity by mere boiling. This point has been
established by Sir ALrrep Ewrne.*

I have found, however, that overstrained high carbon steels and the alloy steels do
not recover proportional elasticity either by resting or by boiling.

The elastic line of a 3 per cent. nickel steel is seen in fig. 4. It is lettered A.
