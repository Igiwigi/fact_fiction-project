arc, and indeed such phenomena as the “ pole effect,” or the small changes of wave-
length which have been found to occur in the neighbourhood of the poles of the are,
may ultimately be explained in this way. In this case any contribution to the
phenomenon of the direct action of the potential fall between the poles might be
detected by polarizing the light. It may also be necessary to consider whether many

DISTRIBUTION OF INTENSITY IN BROADENED SPECTRUM LINES. 487

apparent cases of reversal are not in fact spurious, having no relation to true reversal,
due to absorption.

Finally, the different character of lines of the same series in the spectra of the
alkaline earth metals which has been noted by Royps* may be expected to fall into
line with their electrical resolution when the necessary data are available.

(XL) Ultraspectroscopic Analysis by Means of the Neutral Wedge.

It may be mentioned that the neutral wedge as an accessory to the spectroscope
virtually increases its resolving power. The intensity distribution of the image of an
infinitely narrow line, as seen in a spectroscope of known resolving power, is precisely
defined, and analysis by means of the neutral wedge enables us to build up a system,
