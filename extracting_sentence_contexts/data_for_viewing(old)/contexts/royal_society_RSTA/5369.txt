Figure 2a reveals that the costs of analog power consumption in ATP s~* are significantly less
than those of digital power consumption even at nearly 10 bits of precision. At this crossover
precision, the power consumption is a staggering 10 million ATP s~', so high that a yeast cell will
be using almost its entire power budget to add two numbers at 10-bit precision! It is not surprising
then that cells do not waste their energy doing highly accurate digital computation as computers
do. The figure also implies that a synthetic biological circuit that just has 163 simple two-input
deterministically robust logic gates is not practical. Thus, deterministic digital approaches to
synthetic computation have barely scaled over a decade [9] and seem unlikely to in the future.
Digital computation will likely have to be probabilistic and therefore behave more as noisy analog
computation with a lower value of Naight. A lower value of Ngigt will necessarily make digital
computation less robust and more probabilistic as we discuss in §3¢. Probabilistic ‘dithering’
converts digital black-and-white pixels in an image to greyscale pixels. Thus probabilistic digital
operation will have similarities to noisy analog operation, which is in fact noisy precisely because
many probabilistic digital Poisson events constitute its value [1,11].
