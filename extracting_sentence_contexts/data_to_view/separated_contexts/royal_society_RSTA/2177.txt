In view of the theoretical importance
Zwhich the exact value of N for Hydrogen and for Helium has recently assumed, it
zi necessary that the true value should not remain a matter of doubt, and only a
precise determination of the separations can decide the question. If for example,
the separation in Hs were found to be of the same order as that of a Principal series,
Ey very important correction would be necessary in the observed wave-length of the
Soptical centre of H, which might change N very appreciably. This, in fact, as is
~gshown by the experiments to be described later, actually occurs. is]
