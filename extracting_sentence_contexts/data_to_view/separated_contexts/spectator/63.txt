But O, my Muse, the whole Adventure tell, As ev'ry Accident in order fell. Tall Groves of Trees the Hadrian Tow'r surround,
        Fictitious Trees with Paper Garlands crown'd,
        These know no Spring, but when their Bodies sprout
        In Fire, and shoot their gilded Blossoms out; When blazing Leaves appear above their Head,
        And into branching Flames their Bodies spread. Whilst real Thunder splits the Firmament,
        And Heav'n's whole Roof in one vast Cleft is rent,
        The three-fork'd Tongue amidst the Rupture lolls,
        Then drops and on the Airy Turret falls.
