at which the retrieval has been performed. In each figure, the top left panel shows the integrated
intensity of the analysed spectra, the top right panel the retrieved VMR, the bottom left panel the
retrieved temperature and the right bottom panel the concentration of H} obtained combining
the retrieved temperatures and VMR using the pressure profile assumed in the retrievals.

The top left panel of figure 6 shows that the integrated emissions of H} varies dramatically
from regions outside to regions above the auroral main oval. In particular, we see a peak of
the intensity in the spectra with tangent altitudes from 650 to 950km above the 1 bar surface
of Jupiter. The same panel of figure 7 shows a similar increase but homogeneously distributed
over the whole vertical range of the observations. This difference is not reflected in the top right
panels of the two figures, that show the distribution of the Hy retrieved VMR from the observed
spectra with approximately the same vertical behaviour (maximum above 700 km). The behaviour
of the integrated emission reported in figure 7 can be explained by the fact that in limb geometry,
the signal reaching the instrument is due to the signal originated by all the atmospheric layers
encountered by the instrument LOS. In case, the atmosphere is optically thin, we attribute to the
tangent altitude of the observations the signal that can be originated by layers well above the
