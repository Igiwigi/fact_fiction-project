original Compton scattering diagram showed strikingly that a single diagram could embody a
gauge-invariant expression requiring the summation of two Feynman diagrams in the normal
representation. Exploration of the four-field pure gauge-theory amplitudes had extended this
observation. The extension to more than four fields was attempted and in fact the right expression
written down for five gauge fields, but verification by full summation over Feynman diagrams
seemed too daunting. Only a simplified version of this problem, double Compton scattering, was
pursued [8]. Although, indeed, the manifest gauge invariance of these diagrams was notable,
the very limited range of examples offered too slender a base on which to build a general
picture.
