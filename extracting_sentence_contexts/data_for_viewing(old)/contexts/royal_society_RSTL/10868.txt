mixed with oxyhamoglobin, it is well marked in those of the thigh. (Spectrum 8,
Chart IV.)

In Rana temporaria it occurs well marked in the ventricle and feebly in the auriele,
in both places mixed with oxyhemoglobin. In faint traces in the thigh and calf
museles, which are very pale. Also in other muscles. (See spectrum 7, Chart IV.)

In Salamandra maculosd it is present mixed with oxyhamoglobin in the ventricle ;
in traces in the arm and leg muscles and elsewhere in the voluntary musecles,

In the little green tree-frog (7yla arborea) the distribution of myohaematin was
more carefully studied, and here I may observe that its absence must not be concluded
from the fact that the muscle does not show the bands at once. If present in the
oxidised state they may be invisible, 80 that a reducing agent may be necessary to
bring them out. Tn most cases I used sulphide of ammonium in water or STOKEs's
fluid. It is present in 7Tyla's ventricle and in the auricie, in the flexors of thigh,
and in its extensors ; in the tongue muscles in, traces ; in the calf muscles ; in the
muscles in anterior aspect of leg ; in the musecles of arm and forearm, and in all these
apparently it is the sole pigment. Tt is mixed with oxyhemoglobin in the muscles of
the back and s8ometimes in those of tongue. : '

In the Axolotl (Siredon pisciformis) a feeble myohematin spectrum was 8een in the
ventricle and auricles, faint traces in the abdominal museles, in those of the tail, and
in the muscles of the leg ; while in those of the tongue, and of the back only oxyhe-
moglobin could be seen, In the © red frog ” (species ?) myohematin occurs in the
