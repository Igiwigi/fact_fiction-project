We must then imagine the electric
charge as freely distributed over the surface of the core in order to maintain this state
of equilibrium, and the traction will simply be the usual forcive on this electric charge,
namely, a normal pull equal to o2/8a per unit area, where o is its surface-density. as
above. The same result would be more directly derived by varying the energy in the
wether with respect to a displacement of the surface of the core.
17. 1t remains to find the electrokinetic part of the forcive tending to increase the
electric displacement (/, g, h) in an element 57 of free zether. The kinetic energy ass0-
ciated with the element is

T, = (fF + gG + AH) 87;

therefore

No difference is here introduced by motion of the wther such as represents magnetic
induction : in fact we have seen that the kinetic reaction on an electron ¢ moving
ong with the ether is—edF/dt simply ; and to a doublet moving in this way the
electric displacement in the element of sether itself may be assimilated. This forcive
P., Qs, Ry) strains the wther, and is compensated jointly by the stress which it thus
calls forth and the kinetic reaction of the motion involved in change of strain.

18. We have now to formulate the intensity (wu, v, w) of the total circuital current
