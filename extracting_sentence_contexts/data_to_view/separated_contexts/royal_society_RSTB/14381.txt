This, I would like to suggest, is the qualitative marker of
the transition to the human condition: the emergence of col-
laborative computation. It was a transition in computational
individuality. The uniqueness of our cultures—the fact that
they are innovation-based and cumulative, and the fact
that they rely on shared values, norms and _identities—
should be attributed to this revolutionary change.
