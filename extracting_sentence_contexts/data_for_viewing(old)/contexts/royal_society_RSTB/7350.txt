so that in this case it is black or grey which has encroached on white.

To sum up: not only may white objects on dark backgrounds appear to be larger than
they really are, because of chromatic aberration, but small black objects on bright back-
grounds may appear to be larger also for the same reason.

VI. THE ANTICHROMATIC RESPONSES

Of the various hypotheses advanced to explain the colour changes described in Parts II, III and IV,
only one fits in with the observed facts, namely, that there is a neurological mechanism situated
somewhere on the nerve path between the photoreceptors of the retina, and the brain; this consists
of four separate parts, one for blue, one for yellow, one for red, and one for blue-green: these are
responsible for bringing about the colour changes, and are therefore responsible for eliminating the
fringes produced by the chromatic aberration of the lens system of the eye. For this reason they
have been called the ‘antichromatic responses’.

(67) The colour changes which follow a reduction of visual angle

An account has been given in previous Parts of the loss of colour suffered by yellow, blue,
red and blue-green, when the visual angle which they subtend at the eye is reduced
sufficiently. In the previous Part the employment of these colour changes, for the elimina-
tion of the fringes produced by chromatic aberration, is described. In this Part it is
