deteriorative processes, such as oxidative stress, telomere
attrition, mobilization of transposable elements, immunose-
nescence and metabolic instability. Accordingly, different
studies focus on different proximate mechanisms, which
complicates comparisons and may lead to apparent idiosyn-
crasies. A comprehensive perspective like the TI-J-LiFe
framework may help to put these single parts into context
and may allow authors to explicitly pinpoint which parts
they are addressing in their studies. Another caveat that
needs consideration is that life-history details may result in
apparent idiosyncrasies. Ageing is not necessarily a linear

process. In fact, there is evidence that reproductives in
social animals have negligible mortality rates [65], and ant
and termite queens die rather suddenly without showing
strong reproductive senescence [59,66,67]. However, infor-
mation on such life-history data is scarce [68] and is still
accumulating only slowly for social insects [67,69-72]. If
ageing is not a gradual process, then data just comparing
‘older’ and ‘younger’ individuals are unlikely to reveal senes-
cence processes. Datasets that cover chronologically older but
non-senescent individuals create noise that prevents detec-
tion of true ageing signals and might result in apparent
idiosyncrasies.
