6. In this way a temperature of 300? C.,
which was sufficient to destroy in a short time all the ozone reactions, was readily
obtained, This temperature was estimated without difficulty, by observing the amount
of compression of the air in the outer leg of the siphon tube. Our apparatus, with a
slight modification, might, in fact, be employed as a thermometer for all temperatures
below that at which glass begins to soften. It will probably tend to perspicuity, if we state, before going further, some of the
general results of our experiments on the action of the electrical discharge on pure
oxygen. I.
