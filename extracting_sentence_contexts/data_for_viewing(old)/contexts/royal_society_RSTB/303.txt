CONNECTED WITH THE BEAT OF THE MAMMALIAN HHART, 175

against this possibility, which will be particularly misleading if the true basal phase
should happen to be weak or absent, but which may also confuse the reading of a
normal ventricular variation, An illustration of this point is given in the note to
ixperiment 1.

The origin of the excitatory process can be experimentally determined.—-Apart from
the fact that true stimuli are capable of starting the excitatory process from any part
of the ventricle, I have found that it is possible by local alteration of temperature to
determine the origin of a series of contractions. An excised ventricle which has
become quiescent can be made to resume rhythmic contractions by raising its tem-
perature. Ifthis be done in such a way that the apex is more warmed than the base,
the diphasic variation at each contraction has directions denoting origin at apex; if in
such a way that the base is more warmed than the apex, the directions of the diphasic
variation indicate origin at base.

Spontaneous modification of the ventricular variation.—It commonly happens that
an original monophasic variation gradually gives place to a diphasic variation ; this
change may be attributed to either of two causes: (1) to the subsidence of injury at
the injured lead-off, or (2) to the development of injury at the normal lead-off.
