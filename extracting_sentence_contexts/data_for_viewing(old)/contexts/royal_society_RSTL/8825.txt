thickness of the enamel cap upon an average completed tooth.

* The existence of terminal caps of enamel, a character upon which alone Professor Owrn has founded his
fossil genus © Ganacrodus,” is apparently by no means uncommon ; I have found them in the eel, the perch,
the newt, and the salamander; and as they are very easily lost in making sections, it is probable that they are
present upon many teeth on which their presence has not as yet been demonstrated.

The positive determination of the absence of a thin layer of enamel upon the exterior of a tooth is a matter
of no little difficulty, although it might at first 8ight appear easy enough : the double contour which is due to
the thickness of the section can hardly be with certainty distinguished from a very thin structureless external
layer, though the use of the dark-ground illumination will often bring the enamel layer out distinetly, owing to
the difference in its refractive index. However, as I find the presence of an enamel-organ to be universal, the
presence or absence of a merely rudimentary deposit of enamel ceases to be a fact of 80 much importance.

Of the dentine-germs or papille there is little to be aid ; they have a well-marked
odontoblast layer, especially in the eel, and their bases contribute nothing to the for-
mation of a special capsule. In fact the tooth-germs are only bounded by advyentitious
capsules, due to the condensation of the loose connective tissue around them. The
enamel-organs long retain a connexion with the oral epithelium, which, however,
becomes lost after a time, as by the elongation of the tooth its 8ummit 800n passes upwards
into the substance of the oral epithelium ; the © neck of the enamel-organ ” is seen at þ in
figs. 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.
