My statistics may be
insufficient, I would heartily welcome additions to them; or they may be dealt with
fallaciously. Here is the material; let others add to and, if need be, modify the
conclusions. Only let us follow the method so clearly indicated by Darwin himself
in his ‘Cross and Self-fertilisation of Plants ;’ let us cease to propound hypotheses
illustrating them by isolated facts or vague generalities; there are innumerable
species at hand in Nature ready for us to measure and count. Sine numero nihil
demonstrandum est, should now-a-days be the motto of every naturalist who desires
to propound novel hypotheses with regard to variation or heredity. It is equally valid
for those who merely seek either to establish more firmly or to modify the old.

(26.) I would sum up the results of this memoir in the following conclusions :

HOMOTYPOSIS IN THE VEGETABLE KINGDOM. 363

(i.) When an individual of any species produces a number of undifferentiated like
organs (homotypes) these are not exactly alike when measured with regard to any
character.
