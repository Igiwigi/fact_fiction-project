(b) Sediment properties â‚¬

SLW sediment was homogeneous fine-grained diamicton with no evidence of particle size sorting a]
and is interpreted as till [59]. The overall diamicton texture and the absence of silt or sand DNS
lags indicated slow basal water flow, even during the episodic lake filling and draining events a
documented [36,60]. Porosity and water content were notably higher in the upper 40cm than [3S
in the more consolidated till below [59]. Fossil diatoms and other microfossils and particulates .
derived from older marine sediment were rare and fragmented in all SLW sediments, despite the

fact that the source rocks that make up the till include a significant marine component. When
compared with tills collected further upstream from beneath the WIS [61,62], the relative lack of

diatoms in the SLW sediments was interpreted largely as a result of mechanical degradation, from

both subglacial shear strain in deforming till and long-distance transport from their upstream

source rocks [63,64].

In the SLW sediments, many of the fossil siliceous sponge spicules are of the class
Hexactinellida. These spicules, which are much denser than diatoms and more resistant to
dissolution, have evidence of dissolution pitting while the diatom fragments do not (J Coenen
2015, unpublished data). The observed pitting is analogous to microbially mediated pits observed
