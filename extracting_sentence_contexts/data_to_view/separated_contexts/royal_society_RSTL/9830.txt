A  Hitherto I have chiefly 8poken about the diminution of excitability cansed by the
vagus, and will therefore now proceed to give further proofs that the vagus increases
the excitability of the muscle at the same time that it augments the force of its con-
tractions. The most striking proof of this fact, in addition to what has been already
8d, is given by the effect upon the ventricle of stimulation of the nerve when the
ventricle is rendered quiescent either by heating the sinus and auricles or by tightening
the clamp in the auriculo-yentricuJar groove. In both cases the effect is the same, and is well exemplified in the series of Plate 69,
fig. 17, curves A, B, C, D, which represent the effects of vagus stimulation in a single
