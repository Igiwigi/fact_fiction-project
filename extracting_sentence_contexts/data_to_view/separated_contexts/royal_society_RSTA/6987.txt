Under the assumption that a single transition
temperature exists for any symmetrical (equal interaction in all directions) two-
dimensional lattice, its value is known (Wannier 1945), again with the limitation that y is
two-valued. For our purpose, only the potential energy U is required. There are, in fact, several
approximate methods for finding U, the best known of which is that due to Bethe (1935). These methods have been applied extensively (Wannier 1945) to the Ising model of a two-
dimensional ferromagnet. However, the rigorous solution for a rectangular lattice, due to
Onsager (1944, 1946), is qualitatively different from all the approximate solutions.
