There even appeared to be fluids present homologous with borneol,
but (although higher in the series) having a lower boiling-point than borneol itself, and
probably, therefore, isomeric with the borneol series. 'The substance was obtained from

Little attention was paid to these bodies, partly because they appeared to differ in
different samples of oil, but chiefly because no positive guarantee of their purity could
be obtained. The fact, however, was observed, that the above fluid. like borneol, yielded
camphor when boiled with nitric acid.
