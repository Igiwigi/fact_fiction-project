to rocks or to older drift deposits traversed by these valleys and their tributaries, and
in no instance do we find the introduction directly of any foreign element. Thus,
besides the flint debris derived from the chalk in the valley of the Waveney, and the
oolitic limestone and sandstone debris derived from the Oolitic series in the valley of
the Ouse, all the superadded pebbles and boulders of the older rocks, as well as a

certain proportion of the chalk-flints found in the gravels of both valleys, can be traced
to the adjacent Boulder Clay.

I have noticed the same facts in almost all the river-valleys of the South-east of
England where the valley passes through belts of different formations, as, for example,
the occurrence of Wealden and Greensand debris on the chalk hills in the valley of the
Medway, between Maidstone and Rochester ; 'and in the same manner the occurrence of
Purbeck and Greensand d&bris on terraces in the valley of the Wiley between Wilton
and Salisbury. 'Traces of Greensand and Oolitic debris are to be detected in the valley
of the Thames, also mixed with debris of the Boulder Clay.

With reference to the French area, the phenomena have been well studied by many
French geologists*, to whose works, before cited, I beg leave to refer for fuller parti-
culars than T can here introduce. I will say a few words, however, of the valleys of the
Somme, the Oise, and the Seine,â€”more especially of snch parts as I have myself visited.
