That there should be loss with a soil containing 0°415 per cent. of nitrogen, that
is about three times as much as most ordinary arable soils, is not at all surprising ; and
it is seen that, neither from the combined nitrogen of the atmosphere, or that due to
other accidental sources, nor from free nitrogen, either directly or indirectly, did these
reputed “‘ nitrogen-collectors” gain nitrogen to compensate the losses from the rich
soil. Indeed, Dr. Drerzett’s results are quite accordant with well established facts. Professor FRANK also made vegetation experiments in free air. His soil was a
humus-sand, containing only 0°0957 per cent.
