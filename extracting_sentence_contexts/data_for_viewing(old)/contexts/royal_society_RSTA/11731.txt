kinetic energy in the liquid that is connected with encounters and mutual forces
between the molecules, together with one-third of the mean virial per unit volume
of these intermolecular forces, the latter part being negative and, if polar forces
could be assumed absent, of Ciuausrusâ€™ form }=Rr; and this without reference to
the character of the transition between liquid and gas at the free surface. When
on the other hand the virial equation is applied to a mass in the homogeneous
interior of the liquid, bounded by an infinitely thin interface, the virial of each
molecule vanishes because the attractions acting on it compensate each other on
the average, and the result is that the kinetic pressure exerted by the fluid on this
interface is simply two-thirds of the mean density of kinetic energy of the bodily
motions of the molecules, their internal constitutive energies being excluded.* It
follows that the mutual molecular attraction across the interface produces a pressure
on the interface from each side equal to the mean virial per unit volume; as in fact
would flow directly from the principle that two statically equivalent force-systems
have the same virial.

54. Let us construct as above an ideal rigid tube, with infinitely thin walls which
exert constraint on the molecules but no attraction, having one of its open ends A in
the liquid and the other B outside it; but let us now suppose that the diameter of
the tube is small compared with the radius of sensible molecular action, which implies
that this radius extends over a considerable number of molecules. The molecular
forces acting on each molecule in the tube, whether near the end of it or not, are now
almost wholly due to molecules outside it, and are on the average self-balancing,
except in the case of molecules at the free surface which are subject to the whole
inward molecular attraction of the liquid. The equilibrium of the contents of the
