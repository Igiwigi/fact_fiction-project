The internal are most likely connected with the external trunks; they pass from the
anterior margins of the posterior adjustors, go directly through the central adjustors, and
are lost amidst the fibres of the external adjustors, where they seem to branch.

'These four lateral trunks have been described by Professor OweN* as part of the
nervous system, and indeed they bear a strong resemblance to nerves. But I can find
no ganglia from which they originate, and the external ones undoubtedly pass into the
anterior wall of the body as described: at this point, certainly, there are no ganglia nor
anything like a nervous collar. The trunks themselves are composed of an inner and
an outer tube; the latter is a continuation of the lining membrane of the perivisceral
chamber; the inner is formed of a very delicate membrane, which, by the contraction of
the outer tube, is thrown into longitudinal folds or wrinkles, having somewhat the
appearance of nerve-tubes. 'These trunks, in fact, exactly resemble, in these respects,
the free or isolated portion of the branchio-systemic vein?, which has an outer enyelope
and a delicate internal tunic longitudinally wrinkled. $0 like are the two, that either
might be tigured or described for the other.

Having said 80 much with regard to the central organs, it will now be necessary t0
examine the peripheral portion of the blood-system. 'To do this we shall have to look
to the parietes of the perivisceral chamber, and particularly to the lobes of the mantle,
to the various membranous bands in connexion with the alimentary tube, and likewise
to the brachial organs. In all these parts will be found the extensive system of lacunes,
or blood-channels originally described by Professor HuxLey*.

First, with regard to the walls of the perivisceral chamber: these* are composed of
