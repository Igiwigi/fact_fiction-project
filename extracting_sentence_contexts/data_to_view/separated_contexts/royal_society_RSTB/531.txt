But, so far as it is
assumed that free nitrogen is brought into combination in the atmosphere itself, the
resulting compounds will be found in the air, and in the aqueous depositions from it 5
and the limit of the amount of combined nitrogen so available over a given area, in
Europe at any rate, is pretty well known. In conclusion, although it must be admitted that M. Berrurtor carefully
considered, and endeavoured to estimate, all other sources than free nitrogen, yet the
conditions of risk and exposure to accidental sources of gain, in experiments in open

air, are such that results so obtained cannot of themselves be accepted without reserva-
tion. But the fact that he found distinct gains in experiments in closed vessels, and
that he obtained negative results with sterilised soils, is certainly in favour of the
conclusion at which he arrived. M. Joutm made numerous vegetation experiments in which the soils and the plants
were, with certain precautions, exposed to the free air, and in which known amounts
of combined nitrogen were supplied. He found very variable, but in some cases very
large, gains of nitrogen.
