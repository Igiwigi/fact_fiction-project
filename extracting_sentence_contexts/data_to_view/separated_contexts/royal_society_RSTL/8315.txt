5. On @ property of five twists analogous to @ property of two vectors. —That one
vector y can be determined, which is perpendicular to two given vectors «, 3, is a
proposition to which an analogue may be found in the Theory of Screws. The
mechanical equivalent of the simple vector theorem just referred to expresses that a
force directed along the vector y is unable to disturb the equilibrium of a particle only
free to be displaced parallel to « and þ, or, in fact, to move in the plane of « and B. We may state the result thus: a particle which has only one degree short of absolute
freedom can only be in equilibrium when the force acting on the particle occupies one
position. To the theorem expressed in this manner, we have an analogous proposition in the
Theory of Screws: a rigid body which has only one degree short of absolute freedom
can only be in equilibrium when the wrench acting on the body is about one determi-
nate screw.
