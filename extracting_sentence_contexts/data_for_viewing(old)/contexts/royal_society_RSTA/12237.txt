98 PROFESSOR H. B. DIXON ON THE RATE OF EXPLOSION IN GASES.

Thirty-five years ago Bunsen* described a method of measuring the rapidity of the
flame in gas explosions, Passing a mixture of explosive gases through an orifice at
the end of a tube and igniting the gases as they issued into the air, he determined the
rate at which the gases must be driven through the tube to prevent the flame
passing back through the opening. By this method he found that the rate of
propagation of the ignition of hydrogen and oxygen was 34 metres per second, while
the rate of ignition of carbonic oxide and oxygen was less than 1 metre per second.
BuNSsEN applied these results to the rate of explosion of gases in closed vessels: his
results were accepted without cavil for four and twenty years.

By 1880 facts began to accumulate which seemed inconsistent with BunseEn’s
conclusions. For instance, between 1876-80 I had several times observed that the
flame produced by igniting a mixture of moist carbonic oxide and oxygen travelled in
a long eudiometer too quickly to be followed by the eye. Again, Mr. A. V.
Harcourt,t in his investigation of an explosion of coal-gas and air, which happened
in a large gas main near the Tottenham Court Road in 1880, was led to the conclusion
that the flame travelled at a rate exceeding 100 yards per second. In the winter of
1880-1 I was startled by the rapid increase of velocity and violence as a flame of
carbon bisulphide with nitric oxide travelled down a long glass vessel.

In July, 1881, two papers appeared in the ‘Comptes Rendus,’ one by M. BerTHEtor,
the other by MM. Mariarp and Le Cuarerrer. Both papers announced the
discovery of the enormous velocity of explosion of gaseous mixtures. Other papers
