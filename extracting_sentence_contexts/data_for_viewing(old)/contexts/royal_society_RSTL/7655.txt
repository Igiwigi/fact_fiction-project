5 possibly remain in equilibrium, the denser layers being then the lower ones.

9d 14. Mr. J. Murray þ employed a hollow cylinder of ice as the vessel to contain the
liquid under examination. In snch a cylinder he placed successively mercury and oil at
0?C. The upper surface of the liquid was heated by means of a yessel of water at 100* C.,
supported in s8ome cases a little aboye the liquid, in others in actual contact with it.
'The object of the ice-cylinder was to get rid of conduction, because the ice on receiving
heat does not become warmer,—it melts. But, as pointed out by M. DeseReTz, the
existence of the melted ice and the partial destruction of the yessel complicate and in a
: great measure inyalidate the results. Indeed, in some respects, ice is the worst substance
which could be choxsen, on account of the distortion of the results due to the great latent
heat of water and the 8mall specific heats of mercury and oil. But although quantitative
results were out of the question, Mr. MuRRar succeeded in cstablishing the fact, which
we $hall find confirmed, that mercury is a better conductor of heat than oil.

$ 15. The question was in this unsatisfactory state when M. DzsPrETz published his
first memoiry on the subject. M. DusPpReTz filled with water a wooden cylinder painted
internally 1 metre high and from 0-218 to 0-405 metre internal diameter, the thickness
of the sides being 28 millimetres. At equal intervals down the axis of the cylinder were
the bulbs of horizontal thermometers whose stems pierced the side of the cylinder. The
column of water was heated from above by means of a copper vessel, the bottom of
which was in contact with the upper surface of the column. Into this vessel fresh
portions of hot water were poured at intervals of from four to five minutes. After
