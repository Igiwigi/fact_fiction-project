§21. The absence of marked undulations in the curves of fig. 5, between days n + 3
and n +- 23, could not have been foretold, but the substantial difference actually seen
between the intermediate portions of the two curves in fig. 5 was a necessity of the case.
Taking the D and associated days, let us suppose the representative day n to be at the
centre of a 31-day month, and let us assume—what is not quite true—that symmetry
of characterisation exists with respect to day n. Then we have 31 days, of which the
central five give a total excess above the normal of 1,477 units.

Tt follows that, on the average, each of the remaining 26 days—which would extend
on the positive side to day n -+- 15—must be about 57 units short of the normal. Days
subsequent to n-+-15 would, in the above hypothetical case, come from the next
month. They, too, up to day m +- 24, will have to provide a deficiency, helping to make
up for the secondary positive pulse. Thus the facts that the portion of curve from
day n +- 3 to day n + 23, connecting the primary and secondary pulses, falls below the
normal, and that the deficiency is greater for the portion of curve immediately following
the primary pulse, are quite in accordance with anticipations. Similar reasoning leads
us to anticipate that the portion of curve connecting the primary and secondary
negative pulses will lie above the normal, throughout at least the greater part of its
course,

But the aggregate deficiency in the primary negative pulse is substantially less than
the corresponding excess in the primary positive pulse, being only 1,144, as against
