Ethe r.m.s. residual and the standard deviation remain the same after the sediment correction
has been applied, but we now find that the minimum occurs for T=20, R=174 km.
Bgiving an r.m.s. residual of 7-5-1-5 mgals. The probability that two samples of fourteen
observations will have r.m.s. residuals differing by 1-7 times their standard deviation is 0-12,
‘Band hence the difference cannot be regarded as significant. It follows that, although the
“gevidence points towards a lower density for the sediments and a thinner crust, neither can
be regarded as definitely proved by the results at present available. However, sediment is

A One is, therefore, strongly inclined to believe that the sediment has in fact a lower density,
é and that the crustal thickness is small. The reason why these results cannot be conclusively
B proved at present is because the structure of the continental shelf in this region is com-
& plicated by the presence of the local mass deficiency, indicated by the negative anomaly at

3 station no. 6, and the seismic and gravitational observations are not sufficiently detailed.
