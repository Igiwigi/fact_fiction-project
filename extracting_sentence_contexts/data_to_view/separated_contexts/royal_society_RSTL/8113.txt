The
constant intercalation of new secondary medullary rays which took place here, as in living
exogens, produced the result described. We thus see that in many of its minute details,
as well as in its more general aspects, the growth of these stems has been a truly
eXOgenous One. The bark of one specimen, but which stands alone amongst the number of those that
I have examined, exhibits conditions requiring further elucidation: I am as yet unable
fully to understand its significance, but it is suggestive of additional facts belonging to
the history of Dictyozylon that have not yet been worked out. In this specimen, part
of which is represented by Plate XXVI. fig. 25, we have the exterior of the ligneous zone
at d. Some very slight traces of the parenchymatous layer of the bark are to be seen
investing the woody zone.
