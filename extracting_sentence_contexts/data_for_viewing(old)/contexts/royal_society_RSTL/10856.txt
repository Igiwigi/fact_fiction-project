nal than before to what it would be with a load actually on the wire. In the

t cage, to apply and remove 184 kilos. has raised the magnetic susceptibility

bove the value it had after the wire was demagnetised by reversals. The action is,

fact, analogous to the augmentation of magnetism which occurs (through the
uence of hysteresis) in a magnetised wire which has been tapped, by applying

and removing a load (see IF 78, 85).

—— Here there is no visible magnetism for the stress to act on, but we find evidence
of the fact that a load has been applied and removed in the augmented state of
snsceptibility in which it leaves the wire.

Moreover, jus as in the more obvious manifestations of hysteresis already dealt
QOwith, the effect of vibrating is to remove in great part the traces of previous
voperations. The augmented susceptibility, which is found after loading and unloading,
Sdisappears if we vibrate the wire before magnetising, just as when a wire hanging in
= magnetic field is vibrated and then loaded and unloaded, the abnormally raised
Syalue of the magnetism thereby reached is reduced by again vibrating ($ 85).

Þ $99. I was thus led to conceive of the magnetic susceptibility of iron—a quality
Emenzurable only by magnetising, but easily thought of as existing apart from any
Sactual magnetisation—as changing with changing stress in a manner which involves
