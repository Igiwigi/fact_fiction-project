and social behaviour and adjustment. These traits are known
determinants of future outcomes including better health and
greater income (e.g. [17-19]), indicating that it captures aspects
of child quality/capital. Sadruddin et al.â€™s [12] systematic
cross-cultural review has found that multigenerational care
involving parents and grandparents is positively associated
with child cognitive development and educational attainment
in several cases, suggesting that kin support, particularly from
grandparents, continues to be an important determinant of
successful child-rearing in industrialized populations.

Understanding alloparental support in industrialized set-
tings is complicated by the fact that parents also receive a
variety of formal childcare support from professionals and
institutionalized services [2], along with informal support
from the wider community. While evolutionary theory pre-
dicts that, all being equal, kin are more likely to help
(leading to much focus on kin as important caregivers),
some studies highlighted the importance of non-kin support
in non-industrialized populations (e.g. [20,21]), suggesting
that support from non-kin may continue to be important in
industrialized contexts. Indeed, Yamaguchi et al. [13] found
that the use of childcare centres (such as nurseries) was associ-
ated with improved child developmental outcomes, such
as better language development and reduced tendency of
