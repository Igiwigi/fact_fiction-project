At this point, one should note that the aforementioned concepts are built on the dominant
idea of the 1970s and the 1980s that solar flares are the single drivers of SEP events (figure 3). Thereby, the usage of CME characteristics (velocity and width) as input parameters in SEP event
short-term forecasting concepts is not yet completely exploitable. This is also due to the fact that
when the CME is—especially—well connected to the SEP-observer, particles could be arriving
at 1 AU, while the coronagraph observations required to estimate the CME parameters are still
being accumulated (as evidenced e.g. by the snowstorm effect in SOHO/LASCO images due
to particle impacts). However, since the peak particle intensity may only be reached several
hours later [105], a timely prediction of the peak intensity may still be possible if a reliable
CME speed can be determined from the available coronagraph images [106]. However, taking
