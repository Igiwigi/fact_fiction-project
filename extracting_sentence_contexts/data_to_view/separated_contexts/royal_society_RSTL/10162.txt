IT had two particularly plain
instances of an apparent passage of protoplasm through the cell-wall, one of which I
have represented in Plate 70, fig. 38. Although it still seems perfectly clear and
plain, T am almost convinced that some abnormal appearance has been produced, either
by distortion of the section, or owing to the fact that, intersecting the two coloured
protoplasmic threads, are thin pit membranes which I cannot resolve. As regards plasmolysis, numerous tissues were examined, and in all the same
occurrence of strings was observed. Both Bower and myself believe that the
phenomenon is universal, As definite instances where actual observations were made
I may mention the pulvini of Mimosa, Phaseolus, Rhynasia, Ozalis, Biophytum,
Apios, Desmnodium, Maranta and Marattia ;
