484 DR. D. FERRIER ON THE BRAIN OF MONKEYS.

This animal exhibited less of that dejection and depression which characterized the
other animals similarly operated on:

It is difficult to single out any one positive result of the destruction of this part of
the brain, except the remarkable aversion to food which was observed almost invariably.
This may be regarded as due to the constitutional disturbance consequent on such severe
mutilation ; but if 80, it will be difficult to account for the fact that equally severe
mutilation of the frontal lobes and other parts of the brain caused little or no impair-
ment of the appetite for food.

I am disposed to think, therefore, that the aversion to food stands in causal relation
to the destruction of the occipital lobes as such, and that these lobes are somehoyw related
to the systemic sensations. 'The other animals did not live long enough to decide as to
whether this condition should remain permanent ; but in experiment XXIV, the animal,
otherwise exceptional, after remaining without food for a period of five days, again
recovered its appetite and continued to eat as before.

Thirst did not seem to have been affected to the same extent as the appetite for food.
