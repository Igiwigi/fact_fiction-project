would, liowever, venture to add my expressions of astonishment to those of RowLAND
that so many enquirers have attached so little importance to this point; many
investigators, whose methods have otherwise been of a high order of accuracy, having
contented themselves with the mercurial thermometer asa standard. The importance

THE MECHANICAL EQUIVALENT OF HEAT. . 868

"of close attention to the thermometry is shown by the fact that the difference between

the air and mercury readings, even at low temperatures, will more than account for a

sil change of decrease into increase in the specific heat of water as the temperature rises. An indirect result of my present investigation is to add further proof (if that is

- necessary) to the accuracy of the measurements of temperature by platinum thermo-

/ Meters, and it is remarkable that so exact-and easy a method is not more generally

_ applied to that most dificult subject, thermometry.

_ Another difficulty which meets any enquirer into calorimetric measurements, is the
uncertain nature of the thermal unit ordinarily adopted. I take it that the thermal

Sunit is usually defined as the “ amount of heat required to raise unit mass of water

& from 0° to 1° C.” The obvious objections to this unit are that no one has more than

2a yague idea as to its magnitude, and that in choosing such a range of temperature

Zwe have selected, without doubt, the most difficult of all temperatures at which
