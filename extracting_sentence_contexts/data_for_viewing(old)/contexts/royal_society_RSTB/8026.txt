is more than one corpus luteum in each pair of ovaries; and the ovaries differ from those
of pregnant and post-partum animals in that some of the corpora lutea can be seen, in
each case, to have been formed at different times. The ovaries also contain the remnants
of older corpora lutea, such as have been seen in all lactating animals and represent the
former corpora lutea of pregnancy.


REPRODUCTION OF THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT 127

The ovaries of E145 contain two corpora lutea, the histology and macroscopic appearance
of which show that they have been formed relatively recently, but at different times. ‘This
is shown in figure 7a, where they are shaded differently and labelled A and B, to represent
their difference in age; they are shown as not breaking the circle to represent the fact that
they appear to have been formed, as far as can be judged, without ovulation. ‘The older of
them, A, had reached a stage of regression somewhat similar to that of the corpora lutea
of pregnancy just after parturition. The two occurred in the same ovary, and both can be
seen in the photograph of this ovary in figure 17a, plate 6. The darker corpus luteum
which lies between them is considerably older, and has lost its regular outline. It is thus
impossible to distinguish it from the remains of the corpora lutea of pregnancy such as
could be found in the ovaries of all the lactating animals, so that although it may in fact
represent a still earlier member of the post-partum series, it has been omitted from the
diagram. The ovary of E145 photographed in figure 17a was sliced across at several levels;
the uppermost portion has been removed completely, and a central portion has also been
cut out so as to reveal a cut surface about 1 cm lower than that in which the above-
mentioned corpora lutea lie. In this lower cut surface can be seen several follicles of
