What this blastocyst does
clearly demonstrate, however, is that the exoccelomic mesoderm is formed before
there is any definite indication of a primitive streak thickening in the shield-ectoderm. It will probably be agreed that the most likely source of origin of that mesoderm is
from the said ectoderm, but whether it arises as a localised proliferation from its postero-
median margin as Husrecut inferred or as a more diffuse proliferation, must for the
time being remain undecided, though from what I have seen of the early development
of the mesoderm in the Pithecoids, I am inclined to believe that the former alternative
will turn out to be the correct one. If we pass now to the slightly later blastocysts represented by Tarsius 86 and 235,
certain noteworthy facts are brought to light. Both blastocysts are of about the same
size (+ 0Â°5 mm. in diam., shield-ectoderm in 86, 0-2 mm.
