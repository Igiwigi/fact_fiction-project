Very little or no endoderm arises from this region in P. capensis, and in P. balfouri all the
endoderm has passed in from the blastoporal area before the first somite is formed. A later
immigration of endoderm which Sedgwick thought he detected in these species can plainly
be seen in P. moseleyi and P. sedgwicki, although it does not occur in the two former
species.

Evans (1go1) for Eoperipatus states that ‘the mesoderm seems to be formed exclusively
from the primitive streak’, and ‘that the endodermal elements are derived from the lips of
the blastopore, with which the endodermal layer is continuous, and that they pass from that
position through the outer layer of yolk’. A similar general account is given by Sheldon
(1889 a) for Peripatoides novae-zealandiae. The supposed evidence of invagination from the
lips of the ‘blastopore’ (the mouth-anus) consists of (1) the continuity of the ectoderm and
endoderm at this point, and (2) the fact that the endodermal layer is not complete when
the first somite is formed and the mouth-anus is undivided. Both these features can be seen
in Peripatopsis and are no proof that endoderm arises in this way. Evidence has been given
above (p. 518) in support of the view that the mouth-anus is not concerned with endoderm
formation, a conclusion confirmed by abnormal embryos which lack a mouth-anus yet
possess a normal endodermal layer.

In the African and Australasian species all workers agree in finding mesodermal im-
migration from a primitive streak or blastoporal area. Sedgwick, working under the
profound disadvantage of methods showing no cell boundaries, considered that the lips of
the mouth-anus (called by him the blastopore) probably contributed cells to the mesodermal
bands on either side (1887). This tentative suggestion has not been substantiated, and the
mitoses present in the lips of the mouth-anus have been considered above (p. 519) to be
