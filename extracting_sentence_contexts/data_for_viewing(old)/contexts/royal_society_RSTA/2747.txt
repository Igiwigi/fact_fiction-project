Ina relative way

And returned on the previous night.’

So, with Tolman’s paradox in mind, Feinberg’s suggestion caught the imaginations of many
normally cautious analysts, and sparked an explosion of literature (by both physicists and
philosophers) on what would be the tachyon’s actual behaviour. The central objection to tachyons
quickly zeroed in on such particles seeming to open the door to the possibility of sending
messages (and not just Miss Bright) into the past, a possibility that nearly all physicists rejected
as being simply absurd (but some philosophers were not so sure about that) [36]. Indeed, for
that property alone the tachyon seemed, to many, to be science fiction for romantic juveniles, not
physics for serious thinkers. (Ironically, physicist Feinberg admitted that he got his idea for the
tachyon after reading a 1954 science fiction tale!)


Well, what would Heaviside have made of the apparent ability of tachyons to visit the past? He
never wrote a word on such things, so let me speculate just a bit.

5. And into the past

Transmitting information into the past is a poor man’s version of time travel, about which the
popular mind conjures up the image of H. G. Wells’ Time Traveller climbing into the saddle of a
machine that, at the touch of a crystal-knobbed lever, vanishes like the morning mist into either
the future or the past. That image probably strikes most physicists as being a hopeless fantasy,
and there is a lot wrong with it (as Wells fully understood) when analysed carefully. To achieve
