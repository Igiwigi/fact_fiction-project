Immediately posterior to “dy,” lies the undoubted dentinal nodule which Witson
and Hix designated “‘dy,”. This nodule is so unlike any of the other epithelial bodies,
that, to say that it is in series with them, as Witson and Hix claimed, is only justifiable
from the point of view of its position. Even its position is in fact different in that it
is embedded in the external surface of the enamel organ and is recessed into it from
outside, whereas all the epithelial nodules are, from their earliest appearance, inside
the enamel organ. In structure this nodule shows all the characters of a complete
enamel organ; there is not only the ring of dentine and the pulp, but a fully developed
ameloblast layer of cells surrounded by a stellate reticulum. Such a structure is not
approached by any of the epithelial bodies at any stage of their development.
