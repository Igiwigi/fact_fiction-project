We observe that links with large membership to the holiday component connect smaller Danish
islands (which are typical holiday destinations, see also electronic supplementary material, figure
$5). Furthermore, such links have in general longer distance compared to links that are member
of the weekend and workday components. In fact, the average geographical distance, weighted by
membership, between connected pairs of municipalities in the three networks is 80.1 km + 67 for
the holiday component, 59 km + 55 for the weekend component and 56.1 km + 54 for the workday
component.

(b) Consistency across datasets

Having argued that mobility patterns between Danish municipalities can be decomposed using
NMEF into three interpretable components, it is natural to wonder if similar results apply to
other datasets describing mobility within and across cities. In this section, we use Facebook
data released by the Data-for-Good initiative [13] to study travel patterns in three European
countries: France, Italy and Spain throughout 2020 (see Material and methods). We selected
these three countries among those covered by the Facebook data, because they included periods
preceding the first epidemic wave.
