If in accordance with the ideas of VAN TrecHeM and StraspurGER the condition
figured in Photograph 24, Plate 3, where the pith and cortex do not become con-
tinuous in the region of forking, be regarded as primitive and resulting from the
expansion of a pithless stele, there arise two serious difficulties. This hypothesis
affords no explanation of the invariable presence of an internal endodermis, and the
frequent occurrence of medullary brown sclerenchyma. It is possible, perhaps,
to get over the first difficulty as SrraspurGER has done, by denying that the
endodermis is necessarily always derived from fundamental tissue. The second
difficulty cannot, however, be so easily set aside. I am not aware that brown
sclerenchymatous tissue is ever found within the central cylinder except in the pith.
This raises a grave doubt as to whether it can be regarded as intrastelar when it is
present in the medulla, In O. cinnamomea the doubt becomes a certainty by the
fact that the brown sclerenchyma in many cases is actually in histological continuity
with the similar tissue of the outer cortex.

It is possible to take another view of the matter, viz., that the primitive condition

is one in which the pith and cortex are the same in origin. This hypothesis has the
advantage of raising no difficulties in the case of O. cinnamomea. Those examples in
which the pith no longer communicates with the cortex are modified, but an indica-
tion of the primitive condition is even here offered by the presence of an internal
endodermis and medullary brown sclerenchyma, which are still retained, although the
