characteristic crescentia curvatire—a modification which is often associated with the
moreor less complete atrophy of the fibres that normally converge to this ossiela from
the lateral walls of the air-bladder, and even when these fibres are present the lyas of
corvutire may be due to fhe fact. that reduction in the size of the bladder is uot
necompanied by a corresponding diminution tm the size of the tripus itself, whiel,
therefore, receives the insertion of fewer fibres than in most Siluride normales. The
seaphium as frequently vetains but a vestige or loses all trace of its ascending
process, and, as the condylar process may also disappear, the ossicle often becomes —
reduced to the condition of a simple coneavo-convex structure in relation with the
external atrial aperture. As regards the effects of degeneration of the sir-bladder on the structure of those
portions of the internal ear which are specially related to the Weberian ossicles, wa
are satisfied that in, at least, some Silnridee abnormales the sinus endolympbatious has
completely disappeared, although the ductus endolymphatiens, ihe cavum sinus imparis,
anid the atrial cavities remain, and retain also their normal relations to one another
and to the scaphia.
