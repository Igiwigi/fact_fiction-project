the continued operation of the same power. The original interval appears to be
extremely minute, but is capable of being increased by a repetition of similar
reflexions as well as obliquity of incidence,”

In a letter which I received from this eminent philosopher, dated March 25th
1816, he thus modifies an objection which he had previously made to my opi-
nion, that the phenomena were owing to the interference of the light which
had entered the surface with that which had suffered partial reflexion.

* The light which you suppose to have entered a little way into a reflecting
surface, in the case of total reflexion, is singularly circumstanced with regard
to the objection I mentioned in my last letter. I did not like the idea of sup-
posing a surface of any kind to contain a finite space: but, in fact, if your
theory should be confirmed, this objection might be greatly diminished by the
consideration, that the thickness of the surface would still be like an infini-
tesimal of a different order from the interval corresponding to its apparent
effect, being the versed sine of a curye of which that small intervyal is the arc,
and possiþly in a circle of curyature not very minute.”

In continuing my experiments on this subject, I found that the colours of
total reflexion did not rise in the scale by successive reflexions ; and as they
modified the tints of crystallized bodies by adding to, or subtracting from, them
a given portion of a tint, I announced in the end of 1816, in the Journal of the
Royal Institution, that I had discovered © a new species of moveable polariza-
tion, in which the complementary tints never rise above the white (the blueish
