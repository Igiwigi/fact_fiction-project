Data on life history, social group size and diet breadth
were only available for 71 species in the innovation and brain data-
set (19 strepsirrhines, 1 tarsid, 21 platyrrhines and 30 catarrhines),
and thus analyses involving these variables were restricted to
these 71 species. A substantial number of the 167 species had no
recorded innovations. The fact that a species has zero recorded
innovations when this is unexpected for a given research effort
may be informative, but it is also possible that species with no
innovation reports have been studied differently from those with
innovation reports [25]. Thus, we also conducted analyses exclud-
ing those species with zero innovation reports in our database. This ‘innovators’ sample covered 48 species with available
brain data.
