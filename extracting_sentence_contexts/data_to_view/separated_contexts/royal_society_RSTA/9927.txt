These fears
were, however, not realised, the only precautions necessary being to keep the joint
perfectly clean and, of course, to tighten up the nuts evenly all round. Occasionally,
as the pressure rose, a slight escape of gas was noticed, but this was stopped without
any difficulty by tightening up the corresponding stufting box or joint. In fact, it may be said that throughout the work no difficulty has been experienced
in keeping the apparatus gas-tight. The furnace is, of course, equally suitable for work 7m vacuo, and has occasionally
been used in this way—in connection, for instance, with spectroscopical investigations. In the course of the present research the electrical conditions have varied widely,
in some cases as much as 1000 ampéres, in others 500 volts, having been employed
without difficulty.
