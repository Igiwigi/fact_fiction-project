We have to suhstitute for T in (13.) its value derived from (14.), which on account

of the smallness of 7, and the fact that T is multiplied by = in (13.), gives T=g for a
first approximation. Hence (13.) becomes

Now, here, the operation (Dy.) is performed only on lines at right angles to y;
we may therefore put 4/—1 for (Dy.) (se art. 55) ; and thus (15.) becomes
