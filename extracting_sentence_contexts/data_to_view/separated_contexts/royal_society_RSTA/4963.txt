He then appears to examine and dismiss reasonable explanations, substantiating
his arguments with quantitative calculations. What he is actually doing is rejecting Descartes’
arguments that colours are modified by the medium: Newton leaves unstated the alternative
possibility that the sine laws of refraction are at fault. By comparing rays with tennis balls
(then small cork balls covered with woollen cloth), he implies that light consists of particles;
and by giving precise data, he conceals the fact that whereas some of his figures are measured
(how remains unspecified), others are calculated. Claiming to have eliminated all the arguments
that would favour a medium-based explanation, he sets up what he calls a crucial experiment,
although (as his critics soon pointed out) it is not at all clear which two hypotheses Newton
is discriminating between. Ostensibly testing his suggestion that rays are unequally refracted—
significantly, at this stage he does not mention colours—in actuality he is confirming it.
