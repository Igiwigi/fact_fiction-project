and that partial coefficients of association in undefective universes are higher than
total coefficients, and much higher than partial coefficients in defective universes
(Tables IV, and V, pp. 306-307), may be said to bring some support to such a hypo-

thesis, but other explanations are here possible. The fact that the association
decreases throughout life, as far as we can judge from present material, while
defectiveness «also decreases in later childhood (cf below, p. 310) is against it,
Thus I do not think we can accept the hypothesis without wider evidence ; I have
mentioned it as it occurred to me, and would probably occur to others, as covering
certain of the facts presented.

§ 58. The foregoing figures of Tables I-III. show that all the defects dealt with by
Dr. WARNER are associated to a high degree, though this degree varies somewhat in
different groups of material. The question now arises, can we investigate further
the nature of the association between A and B or Band C? Suppose the hypothesis
to be put forward, for example, that low nutrition was the cause of both defects in
development and nerve signs, and that we only found the latter occurring together
because they were both generally present in cases of low nutrition; could this
hypothesis be tested? It could be proved at once by forming the partial coefficient
|AB|y]. If this were small the hypothesis would be confirmed, as we would be
shown that on excluding all cases of C, A and B ceased to be associated. If, on the
other hand, | AB|y| were still large, even though slightly smaller than | AB}, the
