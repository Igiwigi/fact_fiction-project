where E = |a|? and p;(a) is a general nth-degree polynomial. The motivation for adding the term
E"+1 is the same as in the stability analysis [32] and will not be discussed here. The bound C*
found by solving problem (3.5), where the optimization is performed over the coefficients of p2n,
is shown in figure 1 for n up to 3.

Also shown in figure 1 is the value of the steady-state dissipation rate h - fr, which is also the
upper bound for the dissipation rate in any flow, and the numerical estimate of & computed
by simulating the system (3.2) from random initial conditions and taking the time average of &
over a suitably long interval. The numerical estimates use the average of 20 simulations at each
Reynolds number.

While the background-flow method introduced in [40] appears to be rather different from
the analysis here, in fact it is equivalent, up to the reduction to a finite-dimensional case, to
selecting in our approach V = p2. Because every positive-definite polynomial of a second degree
can be represented as an SOS, our result for a second-degree polynomial V produces the best
bound obtainable by the background-flow method applied to this finite-dimensional system.
Comparing the results for the second-degree and higher-degree polynomials, one can judge the
potential improvement in the bound owing to the change in degree. For Re below 40, the bound
obtained with V =p —E®° practically coincides with the laminar values, whereas the bound
obtained with the second-degree polynomial deviates by about 60% at Re~ 40. However, for
