Figure 8. Numerical integration of original system equations (2.1). (aâ€”c) Time evolution of the modal kinetic energy for the
initial conditions which correspond to the modal amplitudes (4.15) for the mode with wavenumber n = 6.k and t are the mode
number and time, respectively. The frequency and the amplitude of the external force are $2 = 0.2, f = 0.001. The blue
background corresponds to the non-excited modes, while the bright domains show the excited modes. (Online version in colour.)

figure 7b is more symmetric and its boundaries are closely correlated with those of the resonant
domain of the free oscillations, which is determined by relation (4.6) (figure 5). It is natural
enough, but one can see that the instability domain is more narrow due to the effect of the external
force.

Figure 7d-f shows the stability maps at the frequency that is higher than previous one. It
exceeds 2p by 50% and is shown in figure 6 by the blue dashed line. One can see that the
instability domains in figure 7a,b have been changed weakly, while they in fact disappear in
figure 7c. It can be understood from this viewpoint that the oscillations corresponding to branch
(4.15) (iii) cannot excite another mode since their amplitudes are small themselves (figure 6).

In order to illustrate intermodal interactions, we performed numerical integration of the
original system (2.1) for chains with 20 massive elements. The amplitude f, the wavenumber n
and the frequency @ of the external force have been fixed and the initial displacements have been
chosen according to the mode with wavenumber n. Such a numerical simulation correlates with
the numerical experiments that have been performed with the full system and discussed in the
recent paper [12].

Figure 8(i)-(iii) shows the result of numerical integration of the original system equations
(2.1). Each of the panels represents the distribution of the modal kinetic energy. The differences
