“* Most of the mosaic diseases applied in the writer’s experiments give no immunity
against infections with the white mosaic or the ringspot necrosis. But after a second
infection with the ordinary mosaic the plants with e.g. the severe mosaic or the distort-
ing mosaic will not attract the other viruses on a third infection. The explanation is to
be found in the fact that the ordinary mosaic will enter into all parts of these plants. ... We have to suppose that the plant cell with different viruses keeps the immunizing
effect of each of these.
