The values for b are those derived from K,,, and K,,. It will be
observed that in the column of differences for the b values, there is a progressive
series of positive differences followed by a series of negative differences. This is
mainly due to the fact that the slope of the line representing the variation with
concentration of the constant a was chosen so as to give the values for a at 40 per
cent. and at 4 per cent as close as possible to these individual values. A closer
agreement would have resulted if the linear relationship had been adjusted for
40 per cent.
