The outline of the carapace is free from the
body, and its anterior and posterior edges are spiny. Tt has frontal organs, and the
basal joint of the second antenna carries five recurved hooks. According to the author, figs. 2 and 3 of the first paper show the next stage ; but
the structure of the hairs on the antennee, the fact that they are plumose, and the
very deep notch in the telson, seem to indicate that this is another species, However
this may be, the structural complexity at this and the next (first paper, fig. 6) stage
is much greater than we find it in Tucifer at the end of the Nauplius series. It will be observed that, while Merscax1CKoFF's larva and the Nauplius of Lucifer
are essentially alike, there is at no time an actual agreement, since certain structures,
as the carapace, become developed earlier, and others, as the labrum, later than they
do in Lucifer; and certain structures, as the frontal organs and the hairs on the base
of the antenne are entirely absent in Lucifer.
