I refer
to the words “pretty closely” and “approximately” which are ‘italicised in the
quotation. In ordinary human skulls the approximation is indeed as a rule very
close, but even in such examples as are provided by our dissection tables there are
occasional exceptions in which the outer inion is found at a higher level than the
corresponding protuberance in the interior. Thus ANDERsON,f in a valuable paper on
the thickness of the skull, mentions the fact that out of 154 examples measured by
him there were four in which this was the case, and in one instance the outer was
“much higher” than the internal inion, Rikcer alsot states that out of 36 skulls
of which the interior was exposed he found only 15 in which the outer and inner
protuberance occurred at the same height, two in which the outer stood higher than
the inner, in the one case 10 millims., and in the other 15 millims., and 19 in which
it lay lower, with a maximum difference of 10 millims. My own observations on
European skulls are in accordance with these results,§ and in the lower races,
especially the Australians, the inion not uncommonly occupies a position above that
of the inner protuberance, sometimes to the extent of 23 millims. The same relation
is observed in all the accepted examples of the Neandertal race, 7.e., the inion in
these skulls is situated notably higher than the internal protuberance.
