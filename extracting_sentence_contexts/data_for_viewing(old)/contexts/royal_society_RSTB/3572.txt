A mixture of alcohol and water (35 per cent. alcohol) is made in which olive oil will
just float. A small quantity of oil, coloured black with osmic acid or red by alkanin,
is poured into it. The mixture is then shaken up until a fine emulsion is obtained,
and this is poured quickly into a shallow cell. The oil particles at once begin to rise
to the surface of the liquid, and for a few seconds remain evenly distributed, but as
soon as they reach the surface, where evaporation of the alcohol is taking place, a
network-like aggregation is at once produced. This is formed entirely at the surface,
and does not extend into the deeper parts of the liquid.

These reticulations are more regular and perfect when the vessel in which they are
formed is kept at an equable temperature all round, where, in fact, it is not possible,
even by the use of extremely minute and light particles, to obtain any indication of
convection currents in a vessel of water placed in the same position.

The application of heat to one side of the vessel causes a more rapid movement of
the oil particles, and, if the heat is sufficient, a convection current is set up, which
produces a complete modification in the aggregation, resulting in the appearance of
polar figures (cf, Dermmr, 1898) which do not at all resemble the aggregation figures
of the living organisms.

If the evaporation is checked by covering the dish with a glass plate, so that there
is a very small air space between it and the surface of the alcohol mixture, the aggre-
gation is not so clear, and may be prevented altogether if the evaporation is reduced
