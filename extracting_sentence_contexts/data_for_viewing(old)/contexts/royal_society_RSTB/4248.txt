X. THe MamManran Ossicu.a Auprtrus.

Another of the great morphological problems of the mammalian skull on which
the development of that of Ornithorhynchus might be expected to throw light is the
mode of origin of the ossicula auditus,

The mode of development of these bones is typically mammalian, and I have been
unable to recognise any characters which can be held to be more primitive than those

oceurring in other young mammals ; in fact the whole structure seems to be distinctly
more modified than it is in Perameles.

The evidence which Gaurr has brought forward, and which he has so ably and so
lengthily stated, seems to prove quite conclusively that the incus equals the quadrate,
the malleus the articulare, the processus folianus (GoNnrIALE) the prearticular of
reptiles. The exact resemblance that Mr. PALMER has shown to exist between the
tympanic in a mammary fcetus of Perameles and the angulare of a Cynognathid
seem to establish the homology of these two bones.

The ossiculus acessorium malleoli of a sheep and of Xenartha has a characteristic
relation to the upper limb’of the tympanic and to the posterior part of Meckel’s
cartilage. It seems, therefore, to be a bone of the reptilian lower jaw, and it is not
