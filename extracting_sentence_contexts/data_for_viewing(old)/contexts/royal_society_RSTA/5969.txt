A key step in procedure (A 1) is evaluation of the gradient VR(u) of the objective functional :2

R(u), cf. (1.9b), representing its (infinite-dimensional) sensitivity to perturbations of the velocity
field u, and it is essential that the gradient be characterized by the required regularity, namely,
VR(u) € H?(2). This is, in fact, guaranteed by the Riesz representation theorem [81] applicable
because the Gateaux differential R’(u;.): H?(2) > R, defined as R’(u; w’) :=lim,_,j €~![R(u+
