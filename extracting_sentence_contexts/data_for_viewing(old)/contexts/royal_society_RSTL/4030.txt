ratio for equal increments of heat is true for all bodies, but the ratio is not the 8ame
for all. As far as observations upon the following substances, namely, water, 8ul-
pburous acid, cyanogen, ammonia, arseniuretted hydrogen, sulphuretted hydrogen,
muriatic acid, carbonic acid, olefiant gas, &c., justify any conclusion respecting a
general law, it would appear that the more volatile a body is, the more rapidly does the
force of its vapour increase by further addition of heat, commencing at a given point
of pressure for all; thus for an increase of pressure from two to six atmospheres,
the following number of degrees require to be added for the different bodies named :
water 69?, sulphurous acid 63?, cyanogen 64*5, ammonia 60?, arseniuretted hydrogen
54, sulphuretted hydrogen 565, muriatic acid 43?, carbonic acid 325, nitrous oxide
30?; and though some of these numbers are not in the exact order, and in other cases,
as of olefiant gas and nitrous oxide, the curves sometimes even cross each other,
these circumstances are easily accounted for by the facts already stated of irregular
composition and the inevitable errors of first results. There seems every reason
therefore to expect that the increasing elasticity is directly as the volatility of the
substance, and that by further and more correct obseryation of the forces, a general
law may be deduced, by the aid of which, and only a single obseryation of the force
of any vapour in contact with its fluid, its elasticity at any other temperature may be
obtained.

Whether the same law may be expected to continue when the bodies approach near
to the CacniarD DE La Tour state is doubtful. That state comes on s00ner in reference
to the pressure required, according as the liquid is lighter and more expansible by
heat and its vapour heavier, hence indeed the great reason for its facile assumption by
ether. But though with ether, alcohol and water, that substance which is most
