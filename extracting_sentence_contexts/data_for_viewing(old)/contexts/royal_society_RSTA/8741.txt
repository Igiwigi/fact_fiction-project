9. We have stated that the magnetic energy expressions just obtained are
effectively equivalent to those usually derived, whereas as a matter of fact this is true
only of the final result ; the various formule employed in the derivation of this result
are not in their usual form but it has been shown elsewhere? that they are consistent
with the complete dynamical theory, the more usual formule and the various
modifications of them which have from time to time been suggested being all
inadmissible on this score. A complete discussion of the justification for this last
statement is necessarily beyond the scope of the present paper, but it may perhaps
serve a useful purpose if a brief outline of some of the more important reasons is
given, especially as they have some bearing on points raised elsewhere in the present
discussion.

In the first place there is probably little or no dittculty in seeing the fallacy in the
usual and simplest form of the theory wherein the expression «H?/87 for the magnetic
