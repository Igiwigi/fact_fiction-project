© this is the most convenient form of the theorem, but as («, B) are known functions of
© the characteristics (", »", g", o", 7") of the condition X, the equation is in effect an ex-
Z pression for (X, 42) in terms of the characteristics of X and 4, respectively.
= There is, similarly, an expression for (2X, 3Z) in terms of the characteristics
S (w,”,g, 0) of 37 (satisfying the relation p'—$/+3g—0o'=0) and the characteristics
2 (w, 2, g) of 2X, viz. we have
i (2X, 32)= ul = Ee+20)
j + W— 4 )
=] This may be easily proved in the case where the conditions 2X are two separable condi-
Z tions X, X' having the representatives («, ), (ﬆ', Þ') respectively, and the conditions 3Z
5 three separable conditions Z', Z", 7" having the representatives («",B"), (")(B"), («", Þ")
F respectively ; we have, in fact,
b= waits 2, 4Xe, B)(e, B'), 4=(L, I 4, 4Xe", Bs", BY", [oxd

"= and with these values the function

(X, X', Z", 7", FH; =(1, 2, 4, 4, 2, 1X, B)(e. BY, BY", Be", B")

is found to be expressible as above in terms of (wv, 8), (w,Y,g,0); but I do not know
how to conduct the proof for the inseparable conditions 2X and 3Z.
