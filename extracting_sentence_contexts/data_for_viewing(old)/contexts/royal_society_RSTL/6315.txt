two points of intersection, the two actual points of intersection, or the two circular points
at infinity, we have one form of result; but taking for them an actual point of intersec-
tion and a circular point at infinity, we have a different form of result ; and the equation
[2n]=0 does break up into factors.

This is verified very simply in the case of the quadrangle. Taking for the two points
of intersection the circular points at infinity, the line joining them is the line infinity,
and its pole, with respect to the inscribed circle, is the centre of this circle ; the relation

. therefore is that the centre of the inscribed circle lies on the circumscribed circle. But,
when this is the case, it is casy to see that the pole (with respect to the inscribed circle)
of the radical axis, lies also on the circumscribed circle; this pole and the centre of the
inscribed circle are in fact the extremities of a diameter of the circumscribed circle.
The condition thus obtained is R*—a*=0 (which is M. MexrTion's condition 2z=0). We
have next to find the analytical relation when the pole (with respect to the inscribed)
circle, of the line joining one of the actual points of intersection with a circular point at
infinity is a point on the circumscribed circle. 'This I effect as follows :—Taking z=0 as
the equation of line infinity, if the origin be taken on the middle point of the radical
axis, and if 7=0 be the radical axis, then the equations of the two circles may be taken
to be
Inscribed circle, a*+y*—2T az—V2"=0.
Cireumscribed circle, a*+*—2Laz—V2=0.
A circular point at infinity is :

An actual point of intersection is
