was limited to the ono specimen of Lepidodendron now become historically famous under the name of L. Har-
courtii, Tho series of specimens which T have described demonstrates a gradual transition from the one type
to the other, with which the French 8avant was necessarily unacquainted, He concluded that the vascular
eylinder of L, Harcourtii solely represented the inner vascular cylinder of Diplozylon, which is certainly not

the case, M. BroxGxtant had not 8een the thin outer ring of small barred yessels occurring in plants of the
type of L. Harcourtii as seen in my Plate XXY, fig. 14,

* lary 8heath, whilst in these fossil Cryptogams they are given off from the more external

woody cylinder*; but this difference may be explained by the fact that in the former
plants the spirals of the medullary sheath are altogether different from the non-spiral
ones in the woody zones, whilst in the latter the two classes of vessels have the same
structure, and differ only in 8ize. Hence in the Cryptogams the one set may be 8nb-
stituted for the other, which could not be done in the ordinary Exogens.

My supposition respecting the relations subsisting between the inner yascular ring of
Lepidodendron and the medullary sheath of Exogens receives fresh support from the
structure of Stigmaria. In the latter plant, now well known to be a Sigillaroid root,
we find no inner or medullary cylinder of vessels. The ligneous zone receives a won-

Qderful development; it is furnished with an abundance of medullary rays, and gives
Soff numerous yvascular bundles which are supplied to the epidermal rootlets that here
