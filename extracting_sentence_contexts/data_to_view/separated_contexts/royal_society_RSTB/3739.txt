In some experiments which I undertook for the purpose, I found that the addition
of erystals of phosphate to albumen containing already formed calcospherites of
carbonate, prevented their further formation and caused disintegration of those already
formed. It is, therefore noticeable that the salts of lime in the condition of calcospherites
are not ina very stable state of equilibrium, they alternately coalesce and disintegrate
under the effect of various conditions in the medium in which they are produced. CALCIFICATION IN ENAMEL AND DENTINE. 107

This fact has an important bearing upon their varying conditions of aggregation in
the calcifying structures of living organisms. The Sheath of Neumann. The existence or non-existence of this sheath has long been a matter of controversy.
