predictions that cannot be disproved are unscientific and
take us almost into the realm of alchemy. Isaac Newton,
one of the first great scientists, was also called the last alche-
mist. For men of his time, the idea that white light could be
turned into rainbow colours on passing through a prism
was just about as likely as it was that base metal could be
turned into gold, or that a panacea existed for all diseases.
We now distinguish among this multitude of possibilities
by using the scientific method to disprove things that
cannot possibly be true and to fail to disprove other things
that might possibly be true [1]. The possibility of disproof

is therefore critical in distinguishing fact from fiction, or
science from non-science. In the field of predictions about
the future, disproof at the present time is clearly impossible.
We must therefore be especially careful with such predic-
tions, and with any recommendations for action that might
arise from them.

Instead of believing model predictions for the future
before understanding them we should seek the more defens-
ible goal of understanding them in order to believe.
Understanding why models for the future behave in the
ways that they do will allow us to check this understanding
against not only our current knowledge of vector-borne dis-
