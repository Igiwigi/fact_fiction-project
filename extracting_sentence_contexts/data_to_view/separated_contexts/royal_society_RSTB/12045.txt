These capabilities are shared across species and
were therefore present before language evolved and provided
the precursors of more complex human concepts. In many circumstances, the study of animal communi-
cation can provide crucial insights into what animals know
and remains an important part of comparative investigation
of language evolution. But accepting the fundamental fact
that animals know much more than they can express implies
that the evolution of human language built upon a pre-existing
conceptual apparatus much richer than that observable in
animal communicative capabilities. It is therefore critical that
future scholarly explorations of human language evolution
take results from animal cognition research as crucial data
for understanding the evolutionary path to human language. Even more crucial is a dedicated research programme to
explore in detail animals’ abilities to combine concepts.
