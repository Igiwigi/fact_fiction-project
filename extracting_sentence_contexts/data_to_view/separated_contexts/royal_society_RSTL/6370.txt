That part of the
nerve-fibre which in the young animal might be said to be terminal, would in the larger
muscle correspond to trunks from which branches were given off in different directions ;
and fibres and nuclei which were in contact with the muscular fibres would be removed,
as the muscle grew, further and further away from the sarcolemma, but they would till
be connected with the new fibres and nuclei which are deyeloped just external to this
membrane. 'Thus we should have a quantity of tissue composed of modified nuclei and
wasted nerye-fibres which would accumulate as the muscle adyanced in growth, and
through which many of the nerye-fibres would be seen to pass. Many of these nuclei
and fibres having been originally continuous with the nerye-fibres would still retain
connexion with them, but this connexion is not necessarily a physiological one. Other explanations might be offered, but I desire now only to draw attention to the
fact that all nerye-fibres at their periphery are continuous with exceedingly delicate

fibres which have hitherto been regarded as belonging to connective tissue, but which
differ from yery fine yellow elastic fibres in their granular appearance, in their mode of
branching and the curves which they form, in refractive power, and in the alteration
resulting from the prolonged action of dilute acetic acid *. It seems quite poxsible'that complete neryous circuits may exist, and the delicate fibres
of the plexus may be connected with delicate fibres from the branches of nerve-fibres
ramifying in the connective tissue. Although nuclei (connectiye-tissue corpuscles)
appear to be connected with the nerves in great number, it by no means follows that all
these are instrumental to the action of the neryous systemF.
