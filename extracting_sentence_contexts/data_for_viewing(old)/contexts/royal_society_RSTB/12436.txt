that highlights the contribution of sleep spindle activity in
this mnemonic process (figure 1). We first suggest that the
clustering and temporally organized alternation between
spindles and associated refractory periods during NREM
stage 2 sleep are essential for efficient reactivation and
interference-free reprocessing and consolidation of motor
memories [24,56] (see [23] for evidence in relation to
declarative memories). More specifically, we conjecture that
spindle-related memory reactivations follow two periodic
rhythms that can be decomposed into a 0.02 Hz infraslow
periodicity of spindle ‘trains’ and a 0.2-0.3Hz mesoscale
rhythm for the iterative and region-specific occurrence of
sleep spindles within trains. We further highlight the fact
that such neurophysiological events show a topographical
distribution over cortical and subcortical structures involved
during the initial learning phase, and that their temporally
coordinated occurrence is assumed to reflect synchronized
oscillatory activity (functional connectivity) across multiple
learning-specific brain regions and associated integration of
new information into pre-existing knowledge structures. At
the systems level, it is then suggested that oscillatory

synchrony in the 11-16 Hz spindle frequency band underlies
the cross-structural reactivation, reorganization and consoli-
dation of memory traces within subcortical-cortical
