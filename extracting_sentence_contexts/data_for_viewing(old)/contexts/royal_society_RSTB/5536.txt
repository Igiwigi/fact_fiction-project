dition found in the insect egg from the typical invertebrate gastrula and to homologise
the mesenteron rudiments with the endoderm of such a gastrula. From a perusal of
the appropriate literature it would appear that lack of agreement arises more from
differences of interpretation than from actual differences in developmental process.

(a) Mid-gut.—l have already pointed out (EAsrHAM, 1927) that anteriorly and
posteriorly in the regions of future mouth and anus, cell masses are proliferated
inwards from the germ band towards the yolk in front of and behind the main
mesoderm mass respectively. The formation of these cell masses differs from that of
the mesoderm, an early indication of the different fates destined for these masses.
That cell mass which is formed in the oral region, which I have already called the anterior
endoderm rudiment, arises at the beginning of the gastrulation process and the corre-
sponding posterior endoderm rudiment arises later—in fact its development coincides
with the completion of gastrulation. It follows that at the end of gastrulation we shall
find the anterior endoderm rudiment much bigger than the posterior rudiment. The
stomodzeum and proctodeeum now develop as invaginations in the ectoderm, covering
the endoderm rudiments. In some cases the invagination forming the stomodzeum
occurs before proliferation of endoderm cells has ceased. ‘The endoderm then appears
to develop from the stomodzal ectoderm. ‘This is usually the case with the posterior
endoderm rudiment, proctodeal development following rapidly on endoderm formation.
In the majority of cases, however, the anterior mesenteron rudiment becomes quite
sharply defined, while the stomodeum is the shallowest of depressions (fig. 33, @).

The anterior rudiment, as previously described and figured (EAstHAM, 1927) has at
first a rounded contour, but when the stomodseum begins to develop it proceeds to
