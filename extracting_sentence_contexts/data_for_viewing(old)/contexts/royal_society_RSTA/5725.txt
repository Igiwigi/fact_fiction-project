A naive continuum limit corresponds to ¢ > 0 at fixed distances in f and x. For a given distance
in time or space the number of intermediate lattice points goes to infinity. Sums are expressed by

Here the factor 2e? accounts for the fact that 1x only sums over the points of the even sublattice.
For a sufficiently smooth wave function, the lattice derivatives are replaced by partial derivatives,
acting on a continuum of Grassmann variables wy, (t,x), Vy, (t,x). We also choose a different
normalization for the Grassmann variables

w(t,x) = V2eWn(E,x). (3.37)

In this way, we absorb the factor (2e7)~! arising from zx. Expressed in terms of yy the
interaction factor D(x) is proportional 4e2yh. The continuum limit is taken at fixed wy.

The continuum limit simplifies the action considerably. We can omit in equation (3.33) the
factor (1+ D(x)). Furthermore, the difference between w(t,x +) and w/(t,x) can be taken to
zero once derivatives have been inserted. We will not write the index N for the renormalized
