I have made some experiments in relation to them, but as
yet unsuccessfully. I have heated the amalgam of potas-
sium, in contact with both hydrogene and nitrogene, but
without attaining their metallization ; but this fact cannot be
considered as decisively for or against any one of these con-
Jectures.

I mentioned in the BAKERIAN Lecture for 1807, that a modi-
fication of a phlogistic chemical theory might be defended on
the idea that the metals and inflammable solids, usually called
s}mple, were compounds of the same matter as that existing in
near to a metal in its characters, $0 that the metallic nature of steel does not mili-
tate against the reasoning in the text, The only facts which I am acquainted with,

that do militate against it, are the metallic characters of some of the sulphurets and
phosphurets of the imperfect metals,


the Decomposition of the Farths, &c. 36g

hydrogene, with peculiar unknown bases, and that the oxides,
alkalies, and acids were compounds of the same bases with
water, and that the phaznomena presented by the metals of the
fixed alkalies might be explained on this hypothesis.
