are associated with kaolinization of the granite floor, and that the valleys have formed by
linking together a chain of such depressions. Excavations in search of china-clay have
demonstrated that the marshes coincide exactly with the kaolinized areas, and end where
such areas abut upon the steeply rising margin of unaltered rock. Writing of the kaoliniza-
tion of the granite the authors of the Geological Survey Memoir (Reid, Barrow & Dewey
1910) describe it thus: ‘The great age of the alteration is perhaps best shown by the dominant
influence of the presence of these kaolinised masses in the development of the main features
of the scenery. The granite area may be described as a mass of rising ground intersected by
a considerable number of valleys, the peculiarity of which is that they are composed of
alternations of comparatively narrow and broad portions. In the latter the stream has
always a very slow fall, the ground is almost waterlogged and, where undisturbed, is covered
by a thick sheet of peat; in fact it is a typical Cornish marsh. Wherever the floor or “shelf”
of these marshes has been tested the granite has invariably been found to be more or less
kaolinised ; so soon as this kaolinisation ceases the valley at once narrows, or, as the stream
tinners put it, ‘the sides of the hills come together”’.’
