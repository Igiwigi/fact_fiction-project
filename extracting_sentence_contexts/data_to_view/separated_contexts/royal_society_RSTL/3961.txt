Had M. Araco stated its elevation above the sea, a better comparison between its
temperature and that of Jumnotri might have been formed. It would be interesting
to observe whether any similar increment of heat takes place in the chain of thermal
springs that rise abundantly along the great line of dislocation at the southern
base of the Himalaya chain, or whether the temperature falls, as in some thermal
springs among the East Pyrenees. It is certain that the majority of the springs
strictly termed thermal, occur in India at or near lines of great faults occasioned by
the upheaving of plutonic rocks, a fact that speaks intelligibly as to the great depth
at which the earth's crust has been broken up. Hot springs were found by Burxss in the salt districts of the Punjaub. In Tkibet,
M. Cso0ma pe Koros mentions the occurrence of hot springs between U and Ts'ang.
