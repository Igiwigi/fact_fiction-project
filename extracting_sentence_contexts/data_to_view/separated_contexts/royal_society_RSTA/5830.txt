The time T.45 + Ts.4 is the mean non-reactive time. This is the mean time for trajectories starting
from within A to return to A, conditioned on the fact that they reach S. Similarly, Tas +Tsp is
the mean reactive time for trajectories starting from within A to reach B, conditioned on the fact
that they do not return to A. Neither the reactive time nor the non-reactive time is particularly
large. What makes the mean first passage time large is that on average a trajectory will make
many failed attempts to reach B so that the mean non-reactive time is multiplied by the large
factor (1 â€” p)/p.
