Furthermore, the Facebook data does not allow to distinguish two different
situations: individuals staying home versus individuals travelling within their home city. For this
reason, the results obtained using the Facebook data may be partially explained by the fact that,
during ‘lockdown’ individuals spent more time at home, just as they would do during weekends. In France, Italy and Spain the restrictions were in fact more stringent compared to Denmark,
especially during the first epidemic wave. With ‘stay-at-home’ orders in place, people were only
allowed to walk in the vicinity of their home location. Our analysis shed light on how the identified travel components contribute to the structural
property of the network describing travel flows between pairs of cities.
