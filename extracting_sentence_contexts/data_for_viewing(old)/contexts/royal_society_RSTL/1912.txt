action by which these effects are produced ; and as it is certain that we shall
be better able to apply the power when we really understand the manner in
which it operates, this difference of opinion is a strong inducement to further
inquiry. I have been led to hope that the following investigations might be
considered, not as an increase of that which is doubtful, but a real addition to
this branch of knowledge.

decomposition already put forth, that their present contradictory and unsatis-
factory state may be seen before I give that which seems to me more accurately
to agree with facts ; and I have ventured to discuss them freely, trusting that I
should give no offence to their high-minded authors ; for I felt convinced that
if I were right, they would be pleased that their views should serve as stepping-

cause whose prosperity and progress they have desired,
