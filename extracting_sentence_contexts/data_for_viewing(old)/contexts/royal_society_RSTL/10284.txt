supported two opposite flask-shaped branchlets : in others only one, with or without
a pyriform body in addition. Sometimes one or the other type occurred ingly and
irregularly (fig. 4).

The flask-shaped body is sometimes open at the apex, though T have never 8ncceeded
in observing anything emitted from the pore. 'These flask-shaped appendages recall
to mind the peculiar bodies figured by WoRoxIN in another group of the Pyreno-
mycetes (Sordaria),* and although no grounds exist for correlating the two phenomena
in detail, the fact is at least worth recording that the lateral pyriform bodies in
Meliola are capable of subserving reproduction, as will be shown hereafter.

When the hyphe or branchlets of this fungus are looked upon from above, and a
strong light passes through from below, one often observes a minute, circular, bright
spot, which appears to shine through the upper wall like a very small oil-drop ;
on reversing the object, 80 that the lower side of the hypha comes uppermost, this
brilliant pore-like spot appears much more evident, and is clearly due to a thinning in
the wall of the under side of the hypha, at a spot where no colouring matter is
deposited in the cell-walls, and where the contained protoplasm is placed more nearly
in connexion with the outside (see Plate 48, fig. 7, and Plate 44, figs. 21, 40).

BokNET apparently refers to these bright spots when he peaks of oily globules in
