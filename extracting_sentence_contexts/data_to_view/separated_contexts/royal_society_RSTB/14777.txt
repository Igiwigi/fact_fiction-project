Field observations suggest that Lessonia view of the focal community, the plankton represent a
is not significantly affected by competition with other sessile subsidy to filter feeders. So, the filter feeder dynamics can be
species and therefore, maximum production rates is only limited represented as:
by total Lessonia biomass. The passage of juvenile Lessonia into
the adult stage is controlled by a rate parameter P)_.,, which is dBr Br + Ba + By + Bj
set based on the fact that plants reach 20 cm holdfact diameter ad feses(1 ~ AoE] ~ 7 Mabe) ~ fnxrBy .
in about one year. The transformation of juveniles into adult —nsunption — palin maintenance

plants is strongly limited by the presence of adults, Ba, in the
system through the term (1—B,)/Ka, with Ka thus representing
a carrying capacity for adult Lessonia plants. At carrying capacity,
Ka, new juveniles are produced (gametophytes), but cannot suc-
cessfully grow because of shading, whiplash by adult plants, lack
of space and/or nutrients.
