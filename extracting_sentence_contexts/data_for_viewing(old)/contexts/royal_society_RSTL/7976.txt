= When the two outer foci are equidistant from the inner foci (that is, when @a"=@'),
Fquation (40) becomes a quadratic equation in 7*; that is to say, we have

D 0=1U—U(@+4"+2Fa+2F'0) + fa" +2kad* +2Rd/a. . . . , (40a)
a For brevity's sake, let

S The greater root is the square of the half-length of the cycnoid; the lesser root
Selongs to the internal stream-line already mentioned.
