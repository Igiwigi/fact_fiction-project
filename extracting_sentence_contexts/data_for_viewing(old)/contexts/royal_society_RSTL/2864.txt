different places exhibit is this : we may suppose that the diurnal wave has the same
epoch as the semidiurnal wave, but that the former wave travels with a different
velocity from the latter. The consequence of this would be that the diurnal inequality
would at one port be thrown entirely upon the high water, at a place at some distance,
where the diurnal wave had gained (or lost) six (lunar) hours upon the semidiurnal
wave, the diurnal inequality would fall entirely upon the low water, and would not
appear in the high water at all; and at intermediate places it would affect both high
and low waters. If neither of these cases appear to agree with the facts, there ap-
pears to be no supposition remaining but that the diurnal wave travels irregularly, s0
as to affect only or principally sometimes high water, sometimes low water, some-
times both, with no regular progression. And in this case it may be conceived that
the diurnal wave at some places vanishes or becomes very small, as I have shown in
the Sixth Series of these Researches that the semidiurnal wave does, even in the near
neighbourhood of places where it is of considerable magnitude.

The form of the curve which represents the diurnal wave at a series of ports would
be modified in the following manner on these different suppositions. If the epoch of
this wave changes more rapidly than that of the other inequalities, the sinuous curve
which represents the diurnal wave, will have its zero ordinates, and its maximum or-
dinates, gradually transferred from one half day to a succeeding one, and 80 on, as
