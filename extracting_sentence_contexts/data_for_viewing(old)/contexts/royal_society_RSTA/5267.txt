example is the following hedgehog singularity.

Example 1.3 ({10,12]). x/|x| :R8 + Stisa minimizing harmonic map.

Motivated by the isolated point singularity for minimizing harmonic maps, it is natural to ask
the following.

Question 1.4. Is the set sing(d) for a minimizer of Oseen—Frank energy 6or in theorem 1.1 a set of
finite points?

The main difficulty in investigating the size of singular set of minimizers d to the Oseen—-Frank
energy functional 4, is that it is an open question whether an energy monotonicity inequality,
similar to that of harmonic maps [7], holds for d. In fact, the following seemingly simple question
remains open.

Question 1.5. Assume kq = —kp and max, <j<3 |k; — 1| K 1. Suppose d € H}(2,S?) is a minimizer of
the Oseen—Frank energy or. Is the following monotonicity inequality true?
