But I
profess myself totally unable to explain with greater accuracy why, in passing from
Mullaghmore to Ballyeastle, the principal reduction of lunar tide takes place between
Mullaghmore and Port Rush, while the principal reduction of solar tide takes place
between Port Rush and Ballycastle. The snecessive diminution in the values of - from Kilbaha to Kilrush, Foynes

Island, and Limerick, as well as the reduction from Dunmore East to New Ross, and
that from Port Rush to Buncrana and Carrowkeel, are to be explained from the other
consideration which I have described as applicable to rivers. In fact, in these cases,
from the very greatly contracted current-way at low water, the effect of variation in
the depression of the ocean low water is very small, and therefore the effect of semi-
menstrual inequality is sensible almost only in the high water, and its whole effect
on the range is therefore less than it ought to be. Before dismissing this table, I shall remark, that the very great diminution in the
range of tide in the North Channel, makes it impossible for us to believe that the
tide in the Irish Channel is supplied from the North Channel, however much the
consideration of the times in the next section may lead us, in the first instance, to
imagine 80. I will now proceed with the age of the tide as shown by the heights.
