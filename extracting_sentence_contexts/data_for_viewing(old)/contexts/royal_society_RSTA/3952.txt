The hydration level of soluble macromolecules is high enough in concentrated conditions
to affect substantially the diffusional and transport properties of proteins. Hydrodynamic
interactions are therefore key to understanding both the motion of proteins in dilute and
in crowding conditions. This has been pointed out in seminal theoretical and experimental
work [7-10].

From the previous discussion, it is clear that a crucial role is played by modelling appropriately
the high diversity of biological environments. This is a formidable task and requires selecting the
relevant degrees of freedom and propagating them in time subject to properly chosen boundary
conditions. Computer simulation and modelling can play a synergistic role in this sense. In
fact, an explicit particle-based representation of the macromolecules cannot be avoided, whereas
hydrodynamics has to be accounted for in explicit terms.

Our approach to modelling the cellular environments takes these two elements in

consideration by the following dual approach: (i) by describing macromolecules by using : =
appropriate implicit solvent coarse-grained (CG) models at quasi-atomistic detail (i.e. the OPEP : S
force field [11]), such that the secondary, tertiary and quaternary structures are well reproduced 2
and (ii) by describing water as a dynamically responsive medium that obeys the laws of fluid aed
dynamics and that is able to host the presence of embedded bodies (figure 1). Depending on the 22
level of description of the biological process, the intramolecular flexibility of the macromolecules : S
can be treated differently, from accurate standard intramolecular forces, including bonding, DNS
bending and torsional terms, to a cruder elastic network, up to a rigid body representation. At : =
