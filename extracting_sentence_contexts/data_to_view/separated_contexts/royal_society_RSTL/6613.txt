Let us begin by supposing these two bulbs to be attached to the tube T, as in fig. 1,
and let us also suppose that they are open to the atmosphere at their extremities. Suppose in fact that the tube T with its appendages has just been screwed on to the
reseryoir R, Now by means of the screw $S drive the mercury up T until it reaches
the level // a little below the opening where the side tubes branch off; and when it has
reached this level, seal off the extremities of the two bulbs. All communication between
the air in the bulbs and the atmosphere is thus intercepted. The bulb B must now be heated as often as possible, and each time a portion of its
air will be driven into the bulbs 6, 3, and there deprived of moisture and carbonic acid.
