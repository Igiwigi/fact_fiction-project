and inserted in an oblique direction : the upper teeth nearly meet each other in the
median line; but there is rather a wide interspace between the lower. The double kind
of action which these teeth have to perform may be easily understood when the mouth
is closed. The flat surfaces of the upper and lower molars are opposed to each other,
and serve for crushing or grinding food, whilst the sharp lateral ridges of one tooth fit
into the notches of the opposite tooth (Plate XXXV. fig. 1) like the shells of a Cardium,
this part of the arrangement being adapted for cutting. The foremost ridges of the upper
molars are received in the wide space between the lower ones, the yomerine teeth being
opposed to the concave dilatation of the symphysial part of the lower jaw.

In a vertical section of one of the grinders (Plate XXXII. fig. 1) it is seen that the
real depth of the tooth (that is, of that portion which is formed by dentine) is much less
than it appears from a merely outward inspection. * It rests, in fact, on an eleyated
plateau of the dentary bone (fig. 1, c), which has exactly the same outlines as the tooth
itself, and the substance of which passes 80 gradually into that of the tooth that it is
only by the difference in the shade of colour that the boundary between osseous
base and dentinal crown is indicated. This anchylosis, however, is limited to the cir-
cumference of the base of the tooth ; for its central parts are separated from the bone by
the extensive but shallow pulp-cavity (fig. 1, 5). We must remember that our speci-
mens of living Ceratodus are by no means aged indiyiduals, certainly much smaller and
younger than those gigantic individuals of extinct species must haye been, of which
teeth 2 and more inches long are preserved. In such fossil teeth no pulp-cavity Is
