are quite small, some escape detection, and the only nerves of any size, the trifacial
and the vagus, do not present anything out of the common, either in extent or dis-

- tribution. These Fishes certainly have organs placed along the side near the tail,
, which by some writers have been looked upon as electric lobes, and which, although
presenting 80me of the structure of those bodies, yet show that they are psendo-
electric organs, since they give no shocks when the Fish is handled. This fact, however,
seems to have no connexion with the development of the brain, for the lateral line and
dorsal nerves which supply those structures are by no means of enormous size. This
8ubject must therefore remain in obscurity until s0me competent person may be in a
position to throw light on it by means of physiological experiments, to which the
formation of the brain lends itself with great facility, because it is placed close beneath
S the skull, which is very thin, and the wings form plates of nervous matter easily

S Although the brain of the Mormyride, being squeezed almost out of all recognition,
does not throw much light on the problem of the homologies of the various parts of the
