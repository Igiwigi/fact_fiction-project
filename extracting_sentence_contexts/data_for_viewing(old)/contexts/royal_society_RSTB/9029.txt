(d) Broadening objectives

While complex network theory provides an impressively rich
set of tools to characterize brain functional activity, neuro-
scientistsâ€™ objectives go beyond the pure description level
and would benefit from tools that are able to address some
of their fundamental demands: classifying patients or exper-
imental conditions, understanding the aetiology of observed
connectivity patterns and modelling activity in as complete
a way as possible, to eventually be able not only to forecast
and control it, but also to steer it to desirable states.
