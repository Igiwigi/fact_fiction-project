330 MESSRS. J. B. LAWES AND J. H. GILBERT ON THE RESULTS OF

In the unmanured hay there are nearly 50, and in that grown by mineral manures
alone (including potass) more than 40, species represented. In that grown by the
mineral manure and the smaller amount of ammonia-salts (plob 9) there are, however,
scarcely 30; and in that by the double amount of ammonia-salts and the mixed
mineral manure, both without and with silicates, there have been, in recent years, less
than 20, and even as few as 16. The reduction in the number of species where mineral
manures and ammonia-salts are used together is in the gramineous, the leguminous,
and the miscellaneous, but chiefly in the miscellaneous 8pecies ; and, comparing the
produce of plot 9 with the single, and of the plots 11 with the double amount of
ammonia-salts, the reduction, both in number, percentage, and actual weight, is again
very prominently in the miscellaneous 8pecies. In fact, the produce on the plots 11
has become almost exclusively gramineous, and considerably more 80 than on plot 9
with the smaller quantity of ammonia-salts.

The most prominent grass on the plots 11 with the excessive amount of ammonia-
salts (as was the case on plot 13 with half the quantity and the sbraw chaff) has been,
both actually and compared with plot 9, the very free-growing Dactylis glomerata ; but,
of late years, ib has appeared to be declining, especially on plot 11-2, with the silicates,
where it, seems to be giving place largely to Alopecurus pratensis, with which occur in
considerable quantity, and each increasing on bobh plots, Agrostis vulgaris, Holeus
lanatus, and Avena elatior., The five grasses enumerated make up a very large pro-
portion of the total produce, whils& Poa pratensis has gone down much, and Poa
trivialis has almost disappeared. On plot 11-1, without the silicates, the Dactylis
