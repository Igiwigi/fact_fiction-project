If the values given in table 110 be plotted, it will be found that the fixation points for
the different colours from red to blue-green fall roughly along a straight line, which slopes
& down to the left. On the contrary, the fixation points for blue-green, blue, and violet also
& fall roughly along a straight line, but this slopes down to the right. Thus the positions of the
% fixation points for red, green, and blue lights, as previously obtained, are confirmed, and
the two different methods are found to give almost identically the same results. Another
8 fact of interest is that the fixation points for the colours from red to blue-green are in the
= same order as the colours of the spectrum, and, therefore, in the same order as the colours
Z produced by chromatic difference of magnification. Moreover, the spectrum produced by
the latter slopes downwards to the left, because the fixation axis lies in the visual field
below and to the left of the optic axis, so that the slope of the spectrum corresponds
8 roughly with the slope of the fixation points.

Now it might be expected that, with similar slopes and colours in similar order, the
positions of the colours would also be similar: red rays falling on the red fixation spot,
> orange falling on the orange fixation spot, yellow on yellow, green on green, etc. But in
fact, the precise opposite is the case, for whereas the fixation spot for red rays is down and
to the left of that for green rays, in the visual field, the red rays are situated up and to the
right of the green ones, in the visual field, in the spectrum produced by chromatic difference
