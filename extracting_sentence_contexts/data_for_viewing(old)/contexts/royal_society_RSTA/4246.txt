bands were characterized as bidirectional with BBI and SYS acting as the driver in each frequency
band. This may suggest that the autonomous system provides feedback information towards



the different central oscillatory components (with the exception of y). All these components
considered together as the whole central activity provide, in turn, feed-forward information to
the ANS.

(h) Limitations and ideas for further research

A limitation of this study is that SZ patients received antipsychotic treatment. However, on the
one hand, it is very difficult to recruit unmedicated patients for such investigations due to the fact
that the patients are very instable in their psychotic states and are also less cooperative. While
antipsychotic drugs provide a basic therapeutic tool for the treatment of schizophrenia and other
psychotic conditions, their effectiveness is associated with a series of unresolved questions. It is
not clear, for example, which of the neurobiological mechanisms (beyond D 2 receptor-blocking) is :
the final therapeutic target responsible for the beneficial effect on distorted information processing =

in schizophrenia, and for subsequent elimination or reduction of psychotic symptoms [52]. On the Sy
other hand, some studies exist [46,48,51,52,64] where the effect of various atypical antipsychotic 2
drugs in schizophrenic patients via quantitative EEG analysis methods are compared. They aed
revealed that in clozapine and olanzapine an increase in slow frequency bands were found, both 22
in routinely treated patients and in healthy volunteers after a single dose and that risperidone : 8
produces fewer changes than clozapine and olanzapine [52]. In further research, we will also : s
