of this monochromatic sensation is evident, the last colour visible is always bluish
even when yery faint, whilst in the yellow part of the spectrum there seems a
tendency before extinction for a greenish hue to appear, whereas, almost to the
moment of extinction in the extreme red, the colour is of a ruddy grey. The
strongest evidence, however, is to be found in the persistency curves of the red and
green blind, which only slightly differ from one another and from that of the normal
eye, and to an extent which might be expected from the nature of the observations,
The persistency curve (fig. 48) of V. H. differs but little in any respect from the
normal, and this tends to show that the persistency is far greater in the blue sensation
than in the green, in other words, that the green part of the spectrum excites the
blue sensation in the normal eye after the light has been so much reduced that the
green sensation has ceased to be excited. V. H. is the first case in which the total
absence of a green sensation is an established fact, and the probable luminosity of
such green sensation is derived by subtracting the ordinates of his curve from those of
the curve of the normal eye. That H. R. is not totally red blind, we have on several
occasions had the opportunity of proving. He has a slight perception of red, and
hence the difference between his curve and that of the normal eye cannot be treated
in the same manner, as it would not represent the luminosity of the red sensation in
its entirety. Tables VI., VII., VIII. give the observations made by P., V. H., and
H. R. respectively, and figs. 43, 44, 45 give their luminosity and extinction curves,
together with the normal luminosity curve for the centre of the eye.

The persistency of the blue sensation, or, we might say, perhaps, of the sensation
which is confined principally to the most refrangible part of the visible spectrum, is
very remarkable, and affords some clue to the reason of the disappearance of the red
