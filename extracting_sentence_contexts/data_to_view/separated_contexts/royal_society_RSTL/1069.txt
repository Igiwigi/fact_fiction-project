S. Read April 12, 1821. Is any apology be requisite for bringing forward the fol-
lowing insulated fact, I hope it will be found in its tendency
to throw some light.on an interesting physiological subject,
which has lately occupied the attention of this learned Society,
as well as in its novelty and general importance. Of all the complaints to which the human body is liable,
there is, perhaps, no class more productive of corporal and
mental suffering, than the various affections of the male
urethra. Tor it is most obvious, that any deviation from
healthy structure in that part, which, from its peculiar func-
tion, is called into action after very short intervals of repose,
must, from that circumstance alone, be productive of almost
constant suffering ; while the mind of the patient is also de-
pressed from the effect of 'a continual anticipation -of /pain,
and the apprehension of impaired virility,

The following is a statement of the result of a new ope-
ration in a very aggravated case, by which an individual has
been raised from such a state of despondency to one of com-
parative happiness.
