d 2. Effects of various Poisons on the Locomotor System of Medusw.â€”As this com-
munication has now grown to an undue length, I shall reserve for a future paper many
facts of great physiological interest regarding luminosity, general distribution of the
supposed lines of discharge, coordination of the centres of spontaneity, rate of transmission
of contractile waves in different genera and under various forms of section, &c., and shall
conclude what I have to say at the present time by describing the effects of a few among
the poisons I have tried upon the Medusz, choosing those upon the list which most
tend to prove the identity of the specialized marginal tissue of these animals with
nervous tissue in general.

(a) The anwsthesiating influence of chloroform and ether is most decided. 'This
fact, I find, has also been observed by AGass1z; and he remarks in effect that even if it
stood alone it ought to be considered sufficient to demonstrate the presence of nerves
in Meduse. Without straining our deductive powers quite s0 far as this, I think that
the marked influence of chloroform and ether upon the Medus may properly be taken
as in some measure confirmatory of the doctrine which that great naturalist s0 strenu-
ously upheld.

AGas81z appears to have tried the effect of chloroform only in the case of Sarsia. I
may therefore state that in all the other genera I have experimented upon, both of the
naked- and covered-eyed groups, the anzesthesiating influence of this substance is equally
decided. 'This influence, moreover, is in every respect precisely similar to that which
is observable in the case of the higher animals. Soon after a few drops of chloroform
have been added to the water in which a vigorous medusid is contained, the locomotor
