damage’. While it is too soon to say what a concrete plan would look like, an eventual package
could draw from a range of tools from insurance, to recovery assistance, to special compensation
funds, to relocation assistance and even immigration privileges. What we do know is that the
size and cost of this supplemental plan are inversely related to the performance of the original
plan, built upon mitigation and adaptation. Put another way, the more harm we fail to avoid
through carbon reduction and adaptation, the more harm we will have to address through a
loss-and-damage plan.!

Just as there are limits to what the original plan can realistically achieve, there are limits for a
supplemental plan too. Insurance programmes, for instance, work best where risk is predictable
and claims are spread out over time and extent of severity. When uncertainty soars and claims
concentrate, insurance markets crash. There is also the issue of morality: at what point does after-
the-fact aid become simply a mockery of justice, a way of ‘buying off’ people because the real
work of harm prevention seemed too difficult or inconvenient at the time?

For a loss-and-damage plan to work, it must be capable of carrying the load, the load being
whatever minimal standards of fairness and coverage that morality and political consensus
require.” But if residual risk climbs too high, it will fall short of even the most basic expectations.
For that reason, it is important to examine the projected load of residual risk under chosen climate
scenarios. The Paris Agreement calls for holding the rise in global average temperature to ‘well
below 2°C above pre-industrial levels’, while ‘pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase
to 1.5°C’. How much difference is in that half-degree? From the point of view of residual risk,
quite a lot.

According to a 2016 study published by the European Geosciences Union, a jump from 1.5°C
