Recent advances in experiments and simulation
have, however, created a situation that defies this characterization, with the rate of important new
findings now coming with impressive regularity [1,2]. The research described herein adds to and


leverages these findings by documenting recent advances in theory and analysis that underpin
an emergent suite of new models and modelling concepts that seek to overcome the intrinsic
challenges of predicting high Reynolds number wall-flows. An imperative to develop the means to predict high Reynolds number wall-flow stems from
the fact that these flows have pervasive and long-term scientific and technological importance. Notably, even small modifications to engineering designs, or advances in predictive capabilities,
can have lasting impact. For example, a reliable turbulent drag reduction of only a few per cent
amounts to enormous annual fuel cost savings for both the commercial airline and shipping
industries.
