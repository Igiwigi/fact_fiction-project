The consequence of this arrangement is that the
commissure of these lobes only exists at the anterior end, and the fibres destined to
form it must therefore necessarily run longitudinally. The structure of the tori
longitudinales in Mormyrus regembles that of the corresponding parts in 1. cephalus
80 far as they are made up of the smallest-sized cells ; but the arrangement of these
cells is different ; they do not occur in rows between bundles of radiating fibrillzee, but
quite irregularly, in a net-work of the smallest-sized fibres ; they vary very much in
form ; 8ome are rounded, some pear-shaped, some oval, and others irregular in outline ;
they give off numerous processes,

Gorrscns,* who gave them that appellation without any reference to the part of the
ame name in the Mammalian brain ; but it seems that the other term, tori longi-
tadinales, is more appropriate; the former term seems to indicate a theory ; but
FriTscn, although he uses the latter name, really considers that the bodies in question
homologise with the fornix of the human subject ; this I hope to prove in the end is
not the cage, and thus the term fornix is a misnomer, as having been applied to a
different structure. These objections do not apply to the name tori longitudinales,
which involves no sort of consideration as to theory, but simply states a fact of form. Tori Semicireulares. The tecta lobi optici having changed their position, and having been relegated to the
inferior surface of the brain, while the tori semicirculares have retained theirs without
displacement, the relative position of these two parts comes to be that of the egg to
the egg-cup, or, as KOKER puts it, that of an oyster to its shell.
