With regard to terrestrial sources of heat, it may be stated that all such s0urces
hitherto examined emit those obscure rays. MELLON: found that 90 per cent, of the
emission from an oil-flame, 98 per cent. of the emission from incandescent platinum, and
99 per cent. of the emission from an alcohol-flame consists of obscure rays*, The visible
radiation from a hydrogen-flame is, according to my own experiments, too small to admit
of measurement. With regard to solid bodies, it may be stated generally that, when
they are raised from a state of obscurity to vivid incandescence, the invisible rays emitted
in the first instance continue to be emitted with augmented power when the body glows.
For example, with a current of feeble power the carbons of the electric lamp may be
warmed and caused to emit invisible rays. But, the intensity of these same rays may
be augmented a thousandfold by raising the carbons to the temperature necessary for
the electric light. Here, in fact, the luminous and non-luminous emission augment
together, the maximum of brightness of the visible rays occuring simultaneously with
the maximum calorific Power of the invisible ones+.

At frequent intervals during the

tion of the electric light, and to determine their relative energy ; I point out a method
