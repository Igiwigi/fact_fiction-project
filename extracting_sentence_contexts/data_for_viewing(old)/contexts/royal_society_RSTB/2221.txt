most cases the primary cause of death. This can be compensated for by artificial
respiration.t In some cases vaso-motor paralysis precedes the failure of respiration.
If three of the cerebral arteries be tied, then a marked rise of arterial pressure
follows each compression, while on loosening this artery the effect is depressor.

Traube-Hering curves almost always occur when the spinal bulb is rendered
severely but not completely anemic, while Cheyne-Stokes respiration and rhythmic
alterations of pulse frequency} sometimes ensue. The excitatory stage of spasm
entirely fails in exhausted or over-aneesthetised animals. Ligation in one operation
of both carotid and both vertebral arteries is almost immediately fatal in nearly but
not quite all rabbits, and is fatal either at once or after the lapse of a few hours in all
cats and monkeys.ยง In dogs, on the other hand, the quadruple ligature hardly ever
is followed by a fatal result. The difference depends on the fact that in dogs each
superior intercostal artery sends a large branch which runs in with the brachial
plexus, and enters the anterior spinal artery. These arteries after ligation of the
other four dilate up to the size of the vertebrals, and supply the base of the brain with
sufficient blood. On injecting dogs with carmine-gelatine after ligation of the four
arteries, the base of the brain is found well injected, while only the larger arteries on
the convex surface of the cerebrum are filled. A pressure was employed for injection

equal to the arterial pressure, and in other parts of the body, such as the intestine,
the vessels were completely filled. The cortex cerebri collapses, and becomes
bloodless when the cranium is opened, and the cerebral arteries are compressed.
There is no collapse when the hole in the cranium is closed by a glass window ;
nevertheless, the pial vessels constrict and the cortex pales. This is brought about
