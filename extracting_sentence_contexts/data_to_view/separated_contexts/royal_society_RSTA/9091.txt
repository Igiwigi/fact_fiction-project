In fact, X and Y are the traces of the extreme ends (photographically extreme)
of the original line, and 2D would be its photographie breadth in the absence of
the wedge. At the apex Z of the shaded area, on the contrary, x = 0, for it corresponds to
a point on the central axis of the original line. If therefore H is the height of the
