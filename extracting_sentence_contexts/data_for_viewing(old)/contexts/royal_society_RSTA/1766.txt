Figure 4 displays the simulations that fit the required criteria on a log-log plot of gain versus
laser energy. A rough grouping of the points into 5 peaks can be seen; this corresponds to the five
different capsule sizes, and thus five different energy scales under consideration. The 3-pulse and
4-pulse sequences are displayed in red/grey and blue/black respectively, and it can be seen that
in each case the 4-pulse sequence offers a significant increase in gain. This is to be expected, as
4-pulse sequences result in more isentropic compression and lower fuel adiabats. Both sequences
were optimized for each of the five capsule sizes. Details of the optimal simulation for all capsule
sizes and both pulse sequences are given in table 1. The increase in gain between the optimal
3-pulse and 4-pulse sequence for each capsule size ranged between 42% and 360%. The variance
in this increase is likely due to the fact that the relationship between input energy and gain varies
with adiabat. Ignition will occur at lower energies for lower adiabats, and so energies near the
ignition threshold will see a larger increase in gain between the two pulse sequences (such as that
observed at 4.2 MJ).

It is clear from table 1 that high gain can be achieved in this regime over a range of energy
scales, despite the stringent restrictions discussed in ยง2. The gain of 54 achieved at 8.5 MJ, while
at a much higher energy than currently achievable experimentally, is a significant result. This
is the level of gain commonly acknowledged to be required for an economically viable fusion
reactor [51]. The gains of 20 and 41 achieved at 4.2 MJ and 6.7 MJ, respectively, also demonstrate
how high gain can be achieved at more moderate energies (although still much higher than
