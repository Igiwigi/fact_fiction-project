It is evident that if
one of these films were heavier than the other the pressure exerted on the enclosed air
would thereby be diminished, and the heavier film would bulge. Experiment proved
that, on the contrary, it contracted, thus indicating that the pressure was increased,

Pruperiment IV. The question as to whether the phenomenon was due to the fact that in the thicker
film the liquid is falling more or less rapidly was answered by closing the cock until
the down-rush was practically over. When communication between the films was
restored the thicker one contracted as usual. The fact that the film contracted if it was 8lowly thickened from below by the
electric current pointed to the same conclusion.
