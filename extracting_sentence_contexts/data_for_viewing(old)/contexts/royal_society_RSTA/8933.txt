D sets in X, viz. (20,)Dy, Dy, (—26,)Dy, or particularly the prevalence of the
—(e+v) combinations in the unobserved lines for KrD. In RaEm these links are
too large to be of wide application and in Ne too small to be of use. In RaEm
the e link is 23678 and can reach from the unobserved ultra-red across to the
unobserved ultra-violet. In Ne the e link is 196, so that its reach is too small to be
useful. As this method of sounding is new and clearly of importance if substantiated,
considerable attention has been given to its illustration, but as the details themselves
are only necessary for a critical study they have been printed in smaller type and
may be omitted on a first reading.

Abnormal D triplet Separations.—It has generally been held since RypBeEre’s
discovery of the satellite systems that the triplet separations for the D and § series
are the same. The actual measures did not absolutely prove this, in fact, they
indicated small differences, but the accuracy was not sufficient to establish a real
difference especially as against a natural bias to expect equality. MrGGErs,* however,
has recently placed it beyond doubt that frequently the separations are really
different. In Group L, for instance, the separations as measured from D lines are
less than those determined from § lines. In the rare gases also this difference appears
quite decisively, but here (group 0) the separations as determined from the D lines
are, in general, larger than those from 8. The key to the explanation is found in the
fact that the difference between the two determinations diminishes with increasing
order—in other words, that the sequent in the same set of satellites is not the same,
and that in a large number of cases the value of »,+1, is the same in both S and D
although 1», ». themselves are different. It is found to be completely explained by
the displacement of one or two ouns between the sequents of the first or second
