instance, that if the wire had been heated for a time to a temperature higher than
that at which observations were being taken, the value of the leak was too great for
some time afterwards. For instance, in an experiment at 816° C., where the pressure
was 1:4 millims. and the steady leak = 30, the unit being 6 x 107% ampére, after
heating for a few minutes to about 1100° C. the wire was found to give the following
values of the leak at the times in minutes stated.

It is evident from the above numbers that it took about 20 minutes for equilibrium
to be established at this temperature, a fact which gives some indication of the
prodigious labour required in taking the observations.

Another hysteretic effect, which is more likely to be a source of trouble in
experiments on the effect of change of pressure, is a time lag of the change in the
leak behind the change in the pressure. In testing for an effect of this kind it is
evident, from the preceding paragraph, that it is necessary to keep the temperature
constant while the pressure change is made. This is very difficult, since with a
constant current through the wire its temperature is a function of the pressure of
the surrounding gas, but by watching the galvanometer spot of the Wheatstone’s
bridge circuit, and manipulating the rheostats which control the heating current as
quickly as possible, the temperature can be restrained from varying very much whilst
the pressure change is being made. The following numbers represent’ the effect at
