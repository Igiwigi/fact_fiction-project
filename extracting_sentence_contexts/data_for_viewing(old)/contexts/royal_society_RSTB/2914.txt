ANTIDOTES OF COLUBRINE AND VIPERINE SNAKE VENOMS. 145

to neutralise 0135 mg. of the poison (0°15-0°015), so that 1 cub. centim would
neutralise 0°025 mg., while 444 cub. centims. would be required to neutralise 10 mg.,
which I have found to be the average quantity ejected at one bite by this Sea-snake.
The venom of this snake, however, is ten times as powerful, weight for weight, as
Cobra venom, presumably owing to its containing ten times as large a proportion of
the toxic principle, so that in order to compare the action of the serum on the two it
will be necessary to divide the figure just given by ten, which gives 44 cub. centims.
for the Enhydrina venom against 17°7 and 28°9 cub. centims. respectively for the two
varieties of Cobra venoms. Considering the Enhydrina belongs to a different class
of poisonous snakes to the Cobras, it is somewhat remarkable that the antivenin
prepared from Cobra venom should have so marked an effect on it, and this fact
agrees with the results I have obtained showing the physiological action of the
Colubrine and the Sea-snakes is identical. In a few unsuccessful experiments with the
antivenin in Caleutta only 0°5 cub, centim. of serum was used (1).

The Relative Value of Caumertr’s Serum against the Venoms of the Hydrophide
and Indian Colubrine Snakes.

We now have the necessary data for comparing the action of CALMErte’s antivenin
on the venoms of the Enhydrina and the Indian Colubrine snakes, for the above six
series of experiments were carried out with the same serum of the same date.
In order to know how much serum would be required to neutralise a natural dose of
virus in a man we require to know how much venom different kinds of snakes inject
