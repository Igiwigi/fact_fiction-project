of eutectic Sn-Bi foils, the eutectic reaction was suppressed. Indeed, there are two different iS
reasons for the high residual concentration in the eutectic Bi-Sn alloy. First, the high residual :2
Bi content can be the result of solute trapping in this phase. Second, during cooling down below : S

the temperature where 7 wt.% Bi is in the Sn phase, cooling kinetics was fast enough to let Bi
not diffuse out of Sn. However, the fact that areas of A- and B-type formed by the motion of the
decomposition boundary simultaneously with a decrease in residual concentration proofs our
assumption about formation of supersaturated solid solution and its subsequent decomposition.
In Discussion, we substantiate this suggested assumption.

4. Discussion

The microstructure of the eutectic Sn-Bi obtained at cooling rate 10-7 Ks! corresponds to the
regular lamellar microstructure formed by coupled eutectic growth mechanism with the leading
phase Bi typical for near-equilibrium solidification [11]. The moderate cooling rate of 1Ks"!
leads to a less regular orientation within the eutectic colonies and a decrease in length of the
lamellae. Such changes in microstructure may be caused by the presence of convective flow,
(soft) impingement of eutectic grains, curvature distribution, etc. In principle, the coupled growth
