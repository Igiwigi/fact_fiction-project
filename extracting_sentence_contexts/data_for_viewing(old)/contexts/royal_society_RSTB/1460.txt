260 DR. H. W. POMFRET ON ORGANIC OXIMIDES,

normally taken up by the cells. They have escaped oxidation because they have
been rejected not only by the cells of the fixed tissues but also by those of the
blood.

Other substances may escape oxidation from another cause. Thus, such easily
oxidisable substances as pyrogallic acid (Ci. Brernarp, ‘ Lecons sur les Propriétés
Physiologiques, &c., des Liquides de l’Organisme,’ vol. 2, p. 144, 1859) and pyro-
catechin (BAUMANN and Herrer, ‘ Zeitschr. f. Physiol. Chem.,’ vol. 1, p. 249, 1877)
appear in the urine unchanged.

This can be explained by the fact of their not circulating in a free state, but, like
all hydroxyl derivatives of the aromatic hydrocarbons, they combine with the
sulphuric acid which is formed by the decomposition of albuminates. These dichoto-
mised sulphuric acids are excreted as salts without further change. It would seem
that sulphuric acid, not being capable of further oxidation, also protects the organic
conjugate against oxidation.

None of these arguments therefore bear scrutiny, and it remains quite possible that
active oxidation processes, though undoubtedly most active in extra-vascular tissues,
may also be carried on by the blood corpuscles, provided the substances to be
oxidised are actually taken up by the cells.

Failing such an active intervention of the corpuscles, it is also possible to imagine
