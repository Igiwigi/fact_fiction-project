450 MR. J. BARCROFT AND OTHERS: OBSERVATIONS UPON THE EFFECT OF

had ever suffered from “ soroche,” and all had diffusion coefticients for oxygen 40. One
of them, indeed, Mr. Rogers, formerly a trained college athlete and long-distance
runner, was found to have the highest coefficient yet recorded for a man at rest—65°3.

While discussing these studies upon completely acclimatised individuals, it is
desirable to draw attention to the fact that the values for the specific permeability,
calculated at the mean capacity, are in all of these persons rather high, and in the
cases of two of them (Messrs. Cuthbertson and Rogers) very high indeed. On the
other hand, their lung measurements are by no means remarkably different from the
usual ones found in men of similar general physique at sea-level. The interesting
question arises as to what influence, if any, life at high altitudes may have in increasing
the specific permeability of the lungs. As above stated, measurements upon natives,
with the limitations imposed by lack of time for the training necessary to secure
proper co-operation by unintelligent subjects, were not found to be practicable, but
they would be highly desirable in order to clear up this question. There is reason
to believe that age and certain peculiarities of the alveolar structure produced by
disease may cause decided changes in the permeability, and it is not improbable that
very high values may be found as a rule in natives acclimatised for generations to
