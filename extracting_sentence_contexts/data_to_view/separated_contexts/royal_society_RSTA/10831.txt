Lot 29, Range XI, Township of Cardiff, Ontario—A very fine-
grained marble, through which are distributed occasional large twisted calcite
remnants, which indicate that the rock in its present form has resulted from the
granulation of a coarsely crystalline marble. The rock bears a very strong resem-
blance to No. 4, but the granulation is more advanced and the calcite remnants less
numerous. The granulated portion of the rock is also identical with that of No. 10;
in fact, No. 10, if more completely granulated, would be identical in character with
this rock.

13. Limestone. Lot 28, Range XI., Township of Monmouth, Ontario.—At two
places in this township (Nos. 13 and 14) the coarsely crystalline white limestone of
the Laurentian contains somewhat irregular-shaped streaks or bands which are bluish-
black in colour and very fine in grain.
