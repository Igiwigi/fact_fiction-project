Either way we find the
so-called source-type solution, e.g. [6,7]

C’ exp(—(aé?/2v))
1 = (C’/2v) fj exp(—(an2/2v)) dn’
for a constant C’. The solution is well localized spatially, see figures 1 and 2. The name has

come from the fact that lim;_,9(1//2at)U(é) = Mé(x), where 6(-) denotes the Dirac mass
and M= i u(x) dx. We also recall [6,7] that for all uo € L1(R!) and 1 < psn,

— If C40, (2.3) is a Riccati equation and the method above does not work. In this case, we
ought to introduce a Riccati substitution U = —2v(W’/W), to reduce it to a linear equation

It is to be observed that the Cole—-Hopf transform arises as a natural course of solution
to the Riccati equation [8].
