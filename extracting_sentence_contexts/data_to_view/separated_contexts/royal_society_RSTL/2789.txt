Thus, prior to the year 1823, the cistern of the barometer is said to be 81 feet above
the level of low-water spring tides at Somerset House ; but without any information
how this was connected with the sea. From 1823 to 1825, both inclusive, it is said
to be 100 feet above the same level. And from 1826 to 1836, both inclusive, the
above indication is omitted, and the height is said to be 83 feet 24 inches above a, fixed
mark on Waterloo Bridge; or © above the mean level of the sea (presumed about)
95 feet.” The discordance between the 81 feet and the 100 feet is easily accounted
for by the fact that the old barometer, prior to 1823, was fixed up in the Council-room
of the Society, or the contiguous ante-room : but when Mr. Daxtz1's barometer was
finished, at the end of the year 1822, it was fixed up in the closet adjoining the library,
on the floor which is immediately over the Council-room : the assumed difference in
the elevation of the two floors (namely, 19 feet) having since been ascertained to be
correct. With respect to the new reference of altitude, namely, the fixed mark at Waterloo
Bridge, much doubt has frequently been expressed about its existence, since no person
had been able to discover it.
