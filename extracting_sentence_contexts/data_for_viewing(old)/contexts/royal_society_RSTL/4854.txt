rapidly from a small mouth in the crater of Vesuvius at the rate of about one foot in
a second. The eruption of Etna in 1832 advanced at the rate of five miles in two
days, which is at the rate of one foot in about six seconds*. We may contrast with
this the eruption of Etna in 1614, which yielded a lava which advanced but two
miles in ten years according to DoLomrevu+F, during the whole of which time its motion
was sensible. This gives a mean rate of rather more than three feet per day; but at
the conclusion it was no doubt much slower.

Mr. Scrors{ saw the lava of 1819 in the Val del Bove moving down a consider-
able slope at the rate of a yard a day, nine months after its eruption. It had, he
adds, the appearance of a huge heap of rough cinders ; its progression was marked
by a crackling noise due to friction and straining, and © on'the whole was fitted to
produce any other idea than that of fluidity. In fact,” he continues, © we must
represent to ourselves the mode in which the crystalline particles 'of lava moye
amongst one another, rather as a sliding or slipping of their plane snrfaces over each
other, facilitated by the intervention of the elastic (?) fluid, than as the rotatory
moyement which actuates the molecules of most other liquids.” | It is generally con-
formable to this view that we find in Hamiuron's Campi Phlegroi (fol. 1. 38. Note) the
curious remark that some lava is 80 incoherent, or whilst flaid has 80 little viscosity,
that in issuing from the volcano (Vesuvius) it has appeared * farinaceous, the particles
Separating as'they forced their way out, just like meal coming from under the grind-
stones.”

From all this it is quite clear that the 8eeming rapidity of the parts of a glacier,
or the slowness of its motion, cannot be taken as the slightest evidence of its moving
