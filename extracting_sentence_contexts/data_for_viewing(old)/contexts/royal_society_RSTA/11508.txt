Any error introduced by an incorrect value of will be quantitative rather than
qualitative.

In addition to the uniform pressure acting on the rectangular plate, there will be a
couple whose amount may be taken as «v’« per unit area, « being a constant depending
on the dimensions of the plate.* The assumption of a velocity potential would lead
to the value v = 2,1 while v = 3 is suggested by the previous assumption. In order
to simplify subsequent proceedings we shall choose the smaller value and deduce the
value of « from LANGLEY’s experiments.

We have now to consider the effect of the air on the slightly distorted thin surface
which represents the boomerang, and in order to surmount the difficulties introduced
by the fact that the velocities at different points vary, as well as the directions of
the normals to the surface, we are driven to make some hypothesis.

Now the effect of the air-pressure upon a plane surface in uniform motion may be
obtained by integrating over it, provided that we regard the effect due to any small
portion as proportional to the area of that portion. }

We therefore assume, as a first approximation, that the contribution from any
clement of the distorted surface is the same as if the rest of the surface were in the
same plane as the element and had the same velocity ; that this assumption, in the
case of simple distortions, leads to results of the right character, is easily verified.

The determination of « depends on the fact that if the width of an arm measured
