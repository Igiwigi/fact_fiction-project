Breast cancers, for example, kill many women but
have not been reported in great apes [131]. Such differences
argue for taxon- and organ-specific risks that may be devel-
opmental or environmental in origin. The fact that the rates
of different kinds of cancer do not vary in unison across phy-
logeny argues against overly simplistic theories in which all
cancers have a common cause. Acknowledgements. The paper has benefited from the comments of
