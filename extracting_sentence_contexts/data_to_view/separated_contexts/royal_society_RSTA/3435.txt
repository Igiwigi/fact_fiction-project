This
probability update law states that

ree) * SSD THC)
Here H; is a particular hypothesis and D is the observed data. CP is based on the set-theoretical
paradigm; here equation (4.1) is equivalent to

(5.1)

p(H; ND)
Dj p(j 1D)"

The term p(H; 9 D) corresponds to the joint probability of the hypothesis and the data.

p(H; | D) =

(b) The law of total probability and its violations in natural science and the humanities

We pay special attention to the denominator of (5.1). In fact, this is the expression for the
probability of the observed data P(D). By using the formalism of CP we can prove that

P(D) = > P(D | Hj)P(H)).- (5.2)
j

The proof is based on the Bayes set-theoretic definition of the conditional probability and
additivity of probability. This formula is known as the lazw of total probability.
