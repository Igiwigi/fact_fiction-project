Despite a proliferation in papers describing representational models to address the optimal
operation of power storage facilities in the engineering literature, summaries can be found in [5]
or [6], there has been relatively little interest in the contemporary economics literature. There is
a larger body of economic and financial research investigating gas storage, such as [7-12]. An
explanation for the imbalance in research into gas storage and electricity storage could lie in
the fact that electricity prices, unlike gas prices, are typically regarded as exhibiting jumps [13]
and the mathematical theory of the control of jump diffusions is still immature. Jumps in the
electricity price can be explained as occurring when the load crosses one of the discontinuities in
the, so-called, merit order curve (MOC). The MOC, or ‘stack’, is a mapping of load to price.
