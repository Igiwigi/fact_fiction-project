A brief sketch of the contents of these and other memoirs on the histology of the
Medus# is given in Drs. HarTwis recently published work on the nervous system
and sense organs of the Medusz, and these authors point to the important fact
that before the appearance of Hackers memoir, LEUOKART was the only observer who
spoke for the fibrillar character of the s0-called marginal ring-nerve ; 80 that in
Haoker's researches on Gergonta, whereby both true ganglion cells and true nerve-
fibres were firs} demonstrated as occurring in the Medusm, we have a mos important
step in the histology of these animals. Hackers results in these respects have since
been confirmed by CLavs, © Grundziige der Zoologie,' 1872 ; ALLMAN, © A Monograph
of the Gymnoblastic or Tubularian Hydroids,' 1871 ; Harri, © Notices Zoologiques,”
Niederlandisches © Archiv. f. Zool.,” bd. ii., Heft 3, 1873 ; F. E. SenvrLze, © Ueber den
Bau von Syncorzne Sarsii;* O. and R. HerTwis, © Das Nervensystem und die Sinnes-
organe der Medusen ;' and possibly also by Em in his forthcoming publication.

Of these memoirs by far the most important is that of Drs. HerTwic. These
