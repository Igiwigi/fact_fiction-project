of blood which pass from the right to the left side of the heart per minute. Those
based on the absorption of nitrous oxide appeared to be unsuitable for our purpose as
they need all the resources of a well-equipped laboratory. We were thrown back on
some of the many methods for the application of Frox’s principle, namely, that the
amount of oxygen absorbed by the body per minute (or CO, exhaled) divided by the
oxygen (or CO,) difference between the arterial and venous blood (in cubic centimetre
per litre of blood) gives the minute-volume in litres. Three modifications of the method
have been used by us: that described (1) by Barcrorr, RoveHron and Suovt (51);
(2) Meaxrys and Davies (52); (3) a method to be alluded to as that of “ Triple
extrapolation.” These methods are designated on Table XXV as B, M and T respec-
tively. In method B the basis of the method is oxygen. The method, which is in
principle, very similar to one previously described by Frepertcra, gives satisfactory
results during rest and on most persons; its principal drawback lies in the fact that
during exercise the subject is likely to have his power of carrying out the details of
the experimental procedure impaired. While the test appears to give a correct
answer, and while all the corrections have been carefully worked out, there yet seems
to be some doubt as to whether the equilibrium set up in the lung is not a somewhat
artificial one.

The method of Mraxtys and Davtss is based on the CO, estimations. It has the
advantage of demanding little on the part of the subject and he never suffers from
