collisions [41]. In this phase transition, the symmetric vacuum becomes meta-stable below the
critical temperature, and bubbles of broken phase will nucleate and expand. The size of a bubble
is limited by the horizon distance, and within each bubble the Higgs field is correlated. But
there is no correlation in the Higgs field in different bubbles, and the monopoles are born
when the bubbles collide. So the density of the monopoles is determined by the density of
bubbles.

In the second-order phase transition, however, the Kibble-Zurek mechanism has been the
popular monopole production mechanism [38,39]. Kibble correctly argued that the thermal
fluctuation is important for the monopole production, but assumed that the monopoles are
produced at the critical temperature and estimated a upper bound for the initial monopole density
using the horizon distance at the critical temperature. Zurek improved this bound taking into
account the fact that the phase transition does not take place instantaneously but continuously.

The underlying assumption in both mechanisms is that the monopoles are produced during
the phase transition. But we emphasize that the change of topology which becomes the seeds of
the monopoles is generated by the thermal fluctuations of the Higgs field even after the phase
transition, not just during the phase transition.

This has deep implications. Consider the vacuum bubble collisions in the first-order phase
transition. Here, the monopoles are supposed to be produced during the phase transition, and
the probability to have the vacuum bubbles are exponentially suppressed. But the thermal
fluctuations after the phase transition become much more important than the vacuum bubble
collision because this is not exponentially suppressed.
