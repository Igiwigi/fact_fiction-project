In the microscope, the upper portion without colour con-
sisted wholly of globules £5 and 5 parts of an inch
in diameter ; the lower coloured: portion was entirely made
up of globules 355 and; parts of an inch in diameter.

Professor BRANnDe, who examined the chemical properties
of these different portions, informs me, © that the upper por-
« tion had the usual properties of the albumen of the blood,
«« When carefully dried, it assumed the appearance and che-

« Jooser in texture and considerably softer, In dilute acetic
« acid it s00n became perfectly gelatinous, and was dissolved
«in it by the aid of a gentle heat, It contained a much
« larger relative proportion of water than the upper portion,
« and shrunk-much more when dried, in which state, however,
« jt resembled dried albumen. It appears that independent
« of colouring matter, these two portions of coagulum differ
« chiefly from each other in their state of concentration, the
« upper part containing more albumen, and less water, than
« the lower.”
