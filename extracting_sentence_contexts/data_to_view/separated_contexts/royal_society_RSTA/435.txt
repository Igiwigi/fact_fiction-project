3:2. Solution of integral equation

Equation (25) forms the basic integral equation of our problem and is analogous to the
simpler equation considered by Magnus (1941) and Copson (1946a) for the half-plane
subjected to a sinusoidal train of waves. To commence the solution of equation (25) we note that the second integral in it corre-
sponds to the contribution from CD for a point on AB and if we omit this contribution we

have in fact the integral equation for the half-plane case. Thus, if we denote by y, the solution
for the half-plane case, then x, will satisfy the integral equation
