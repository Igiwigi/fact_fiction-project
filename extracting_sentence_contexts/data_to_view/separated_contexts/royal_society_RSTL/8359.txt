Tike my vessels, the walls of these cells are beautifully
reticulated. It appears as if these cells were arranged in vertical lines preparatory to
their coalescence and conversion into vessels, but that this double process had neyer
taken place. This substitution of remarkably distinct reticulated cells for equally
distinct reticulated vessels is a curious physiological fact. It is also perfectly clear that
the vessels given off to supply the leaves in the French examples spring from the central
triangular axis, and not from the exogenous layers, as I have already pointed out in the
note on page 45, the former having been the primary vascular bundle of the young shoot. On the other hand, the vascular bundles given off to the rootlets evidently spring, not
from the triangular axes of the roots, but from the exogenous layer.
