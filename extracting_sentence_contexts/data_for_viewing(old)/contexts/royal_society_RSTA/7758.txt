indebted for the admirable arrangements made in Norway in the first instance and

Mr. L. H. Barnsrmce-Bet, of Radio Research Station, Slough, gave unstinted
help in the many technical problems involved in these experiments. The apparatus
was all designed and constructed at Slough, and the quality of the work done by
Mr. J. E. Arey and his staff in the Slough workshops, in the building and packing
of the three tons of delicate equipment used by the expedition, is illustrated by the
fact that the equipment completed its 1500-mile voyage without the breakage of so
much as a single receiving valve. Miss A. C. StickLAND and Miss E. Rocers have
also given valuable help in the reduction of the data.

The work at Tromsé6 was assisted in every possible way by Director L. HARANG
and his staff (Herr. E. Ténsperc and Herr. M. Jacopsen) and also by Herr. P.
Turane (Director of the Meteorological Institute for North Norway), all of whom
gave generous help on many occasions.

Thanks are due to the Norwegian Government for permitting the scientific
apparatus to be taken into Norway free of customs charges, and also to the Norwegian
Post Office for permission to transmit wireless signals over a wide band of frequencies,
and for generous concessions in telephonic charges.
