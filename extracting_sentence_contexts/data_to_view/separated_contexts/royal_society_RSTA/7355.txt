A more precise method is to determine at a suitable temperature the position of the magnet
at which the amplitude of the de Haas-van Alphen effect vanishes, since this amplitude is
not influenced by the steady magnetic properties of the mounting. The angles % quoted
in the results were nearly always measured from a zero position determined in this way;
where necessary they are corrected for the finite twist of the crystal under the influence of
the torque due to the field. RESULTS ON INDIVIDUAL METALS

The preliminary series of measurements (Shoenberg 1949) need not be discussed, for it
has since become likely that the specimen used was not in fact a single crystal. In the later
series, measurements were made on Ga 4 with each of the a-, b-, and c-axes vertical in turn, at
each of a variety of angles between the field and the relevant axis. Measurements on Ga 3
and Ga5 were made only with the c-axis vertical, and established that the results were
rather accurately reproducible from one specimen to another as regards the periods of the
oscillations and the relative amplitudes for different values of y, though the absolute ampli-
tudes were reproducible only to about 20 %.
