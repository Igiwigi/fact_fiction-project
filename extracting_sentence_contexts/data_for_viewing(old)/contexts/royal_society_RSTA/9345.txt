threshold values which do not differ materially from the values obtained by persons
with normal colour vision, The red blind observer N. has a markedly higher threshold
value at the red end of the spectrum, in fact the spectrum employed in the measure-
ments was not sufficiently bright for him to obtain readings beyond SSN 55 (625 ux).
In the green, blue, and violet, his values for the threshold agree with the normal.


THE THRESHOLD OF VISION FOR DIFFERENT COLOURED LIGHTS. 109

The threshold in the red, we are assuming, depends on the cones, and N.’s cone vision
is defective since he has a shortened spectrum, hence his high threshold values
at the red end.
