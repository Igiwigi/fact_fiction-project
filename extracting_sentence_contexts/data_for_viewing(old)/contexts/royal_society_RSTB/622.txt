foot. This condition of Allochiria was only afforded by the clip test. We must,
therefore, consider in what this test differs from the others.

(1) I noticed that Allochiria only occurred when the clip was placed upon the foot.

(2) The clip would produce not merely a painful pressure sensation, but also a
tactile sensation.

Professor OBERSTEINER™ associates the condition termed Allochiria especially with
sclerosis of posterior columns, and I will refer now to an important paper by him on
this subject.

“This disorder consists in the fact that although the sensibility is retained more or
less completely, yet the patient is not clear, or is frequently, if not constantly, in
error, as to which side of the body has been touched. I would term the phenomenon
Sensory Allochiria, or shortly Allochiria (d\Aos yer), or confusion of sides. When
we test the sensibility of a patient, on the leg for example, and find that the two
points of the cesthesiometer are recognised as such at a moderate distance apart, or
when a prick or pressure is fairly localized, and yet (as frequently occurs) the irrita-
tion is referred to the other side, we have the condition before us. The power of
localization is retained as to details, while doubt or error exists as to the side touched,
the irritation being commonly referred to the corresponding part of the other side. I
believe the phenomenon is less rare than overlooked, as errors on the part of the
patient are apt to be regarded as merely a lapsus verbi. In the case of intelligent
patients, however, and with care, it soon becomes apparent that this is not the true
