And so two factors may be recognised as affecting the number of spores produced,
viz., the size of the individual spore and the size of the sporangial cavity, though it
may be a question how far these are causes, and how far mere effects. Clearly, the
question as to what determines the numerical output of spores is not exhausted by

their recognition, however interesting their relation to one another may be. In
ignorance of more specific factors determining the number, it can only at present be
stated as an empirical fact that, while there may be variation in specific cases to
smaller numbers, the larger numbers are only hitherto found in certain groups of
Ferns. In the Polypodiaceze, with their vertical annulus and mixed sorus, the
number 64 has never been found to be exceeded ; the larger numbers, though liable
to reduction, as in the Hymenophyllacez, are only found among the types with oblique
annulus, and basipetal or simultaneous sorus. There is, then, what in absence of
better knowledge I must style an inherent higher productiveness, which commonly
a goes along with the simultaneous or basipetal sorus, and the oblique annulus of the
5 short-stalked, usually massive, sporangium ; these parallel features appear to link the
types which show them on to the similarly highly-productive Marattiacee, which
Sshare some, though not all, of the concomitant characters.
eo Another point which comes out clearly from the results of enumeration of spores,
2 is that variations of number occur within near circles of affinity.
