The firsb complete specimens
were obtained in the © Porcupine ” dredgings of 1869, at depths of from 630 to 1,443
fathoms, between the north-west of Ireland and Rockall Bank. In the © Porcupine ”
expedition of 1870, however, it was brought up from a bottom of only 64 fathoms in
Setubal Bay, on the coast of Portugal, and afterwards from a shallow bottom within
the Mediterranean, near Carthagena. That it is an inhabitant of other parts of the
Mediterranean I then inferred from the fact that I had detected fragments of it in
the Foraminiferal dredgings, made at 250 fathoms by EpwarD ForBrs and Lieut.
(now Admiral) SpraTrT in the Mgean, in 1842; and it is stated by Dr. J. Gwys
JEFFREYS, in his © Report on the Biology of the © Valorous ' Cruise,” that it has been
dredged by the Marquis pu MoxTeRosaTo at from 100 to 200 fathoms' depth, off
the coast of Sicily.
