In the parietal region, except for the vertex, which has been considered, the elevations
and depressions of the surface correspond very closely in the two casts.

In the frontal region the differences between the two casts appear at first sight to be
small, and yet these differences are significant in revealing the early stages in the evolution
of the frontal lobe. Looked at from the front the cast of Sinanthropus presents a some-
what pointed appearance. The orbital margins are gently curved and run forwards
into a well-marked frontal keel. Compared with the higher apes the anterior contour
of the frontal lobes is somewhat blunter and the orbital margin appears fuller ; never-
theless from this aspect the cast of Sinanthropus is distinctly simian. Unfortunately
the edge of the orbital margin is missing in Pithecanthropus except for a small part on
the right side. It is probable, in virtue of the fact that the lateral contours are so
similar, that there was a frontal keel as pronounced as in Sinanthropus. The anterior
view of the cast of Pithecanthropus is definitely blunter in appearance than that of
Sinanthropus. There is an antero-external angle placed only very little behind the
level of the most anterior point of the cast; this angle is only very faintly indicated
in the cast of Sinanthropus where the superciliary margin passes uninterruptedly into
the orbital margin. The presence of the antero-external angle in Pithecanthropus
which appears to belong to the same general mass as the postero-external angle formed
by the frontal cap gives the inferior frontal region a bolder and fuller appearance than
it has in Sinanthropus. It is as though the cortex of the frontal lobe had flowed down
over the lateral surface and become banked up along the orbital margin. The lower
end of the precentral region in Pithecanthropus is somewhat fuller and therefore it is
apparent that the changes leading to the expansion of the frontal lobe were in a slightly
