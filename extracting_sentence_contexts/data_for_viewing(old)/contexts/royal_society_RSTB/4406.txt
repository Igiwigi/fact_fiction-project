crops, of some seasons are early, while others are late. It is not likely that there
should be any very striking difference in soil-fertility over all Egypt between one
season and the next, even in the event of an outbreak of cattle-plague. There must
consequently be some other operative cause, and this is very clearly indicated by our
data as being the available soil-water. We saw in figs. 4 and 5 that the Terraces at
Giza were “ late” in 1910, and later still in 1911, except at the wet end, and we
have discussed the determination of this delay by water-shortage on p. 184. It only
remains to notice how perfectly such delay may simulate real “lateness,” by com-
paring, in fig. 12, the two curves G.’10 and N.’13. A portion of G.’11 is plotted
for comparison, before its feeble rise has begun at all.

The idea of Pre-determination is very useful here. If the crop has been sown and
cultivated in a normal manner, and yet is, on the average, a “late” one, the fact
shows that the cause was most probably a deficient water supply during May, a time
to which less importance in this respect is commonly attributed than to June, since
it is in the latter month that the effects pre-determined by deficient water supply in
May are visible.

It is here that we obtain the first indication of a real major seasonal effect. Thus
far we have spoken of the water supply as if an actual deficiency of irrigation water
were involved, as it was in the curve G.’10, G. 11, and MK. ’13. But there may
very well be an effective shortage of water even when the irrigation supply is normal,
if the weather conditions are unusually stringent ; and in point of fact it is during
the months of May and early June that the abnormally hot days frequently
mentioned in this communication are likely to occur. The auto-toxic effects of such
