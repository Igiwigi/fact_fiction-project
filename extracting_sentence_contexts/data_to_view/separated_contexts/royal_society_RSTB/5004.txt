and 2-1p. (2) The depth measurements from drawings of heterotypic spindles seen in profile
give 1-5y as the most frequent value for this dimension. (3) Where the univalent chromosomes were closely pressed together or twisted about
each other so that the width of the univalent segments could not clearly be seen, the width
of the closely paired univalents was measured and, as might be expected from the fact
that the degree of association varies, there is considerable variation in the value of the
width, but on the whole the most frequent bivalent width is a little less than double the
univalent width in the same species. (4) Whenever there is a release between the longitudinally associated chromosomes or
portions of chromosomes there is a readjustment of shape in the chromosomes.
