MeGcrrs was
kind enough to allow me to use his infra-red concave grating spectrograph. There
can be no doubt that very few lines between A 10,000 and 4 600 have escaped detec-
tion. Intensities are, of necessity, rough visual estimates of photographic blackening
and are quite untrustworthy outside any narrow range of wave-lengths. _ The actual
range of intensities must be enormous, judging from the fact that the strongest lines
on the prism plates were composed of over 60 diffraction fringes. Tue ANALYSIS

The once ionized copper atom contains ten electrons outside tightly bound closed
shells. The low structures to be expected are, therefore, representable by the
symbols 3d1°, 3d°4s, 3d*4s*.
