The stations on these lines are distinguished from each other by numbers indicating
their distance in feet from the point A where the ball fell, The only exception to these
are the stations on the line J K, which are marked according to their distances in feet
from the corner of the pond J.

The sections on the lines A F and A H will give the contours of the hill. The pond
has perpendicular walled sides, and is about 10 feet deep. The lines AB, A C, A D
are along ground which is practically level. At the commencement of the experiments
the ground was somewhat soft, and the ball at the first few blows sank to a considerable
depth.

We may here call attention to the fact that the vibrations which we have investi-
gated, as in the case of vibrations produced in Mr. MALLer's experiments by an
explosion of gunpowder, are the result, of a disburbance produced on the surface of the
ground, whereas in actual earthquake motion it is quite possible that the disturbances
we feel may have an origin which is deeply seated beneath the 8uperficial crust. The
only advantage which we can claim for our method of producing vibrations, as com-

pared with the production of them by the ignition of some explosive material, is that
we are able to make a more definite estimate of the force of the blow.
