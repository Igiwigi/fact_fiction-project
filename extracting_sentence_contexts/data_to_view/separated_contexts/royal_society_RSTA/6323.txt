Thermodynamics came
into being after we had discovered steam engines because people felt the need to explain just
how their new engines worked. We hope this two-part theme issue of Thermodynamics 2.0 will be able to contribute toward
the unity of science, energy, economics and evolution. The fact that engineers in the twenty-first


century study above and beyond engines has become increasingly evident. We should also spend
more time understanding and explaining how humans and human society work. Thermodynamics
2.0 strives toward a better understanding of life, humans and human society, as well as their
interconnection to the material world.
