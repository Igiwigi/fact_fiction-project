A wide, if not entire generality was anticipated for the proposition that the same rays
are absorbed by a liquid and its yapour. I have now no reason to retract this anticipa-
tion; but when it was expressed I believed that liquids in general would be found 80
destructive of the effectual rays as to render transmission through moderate depths of
them sufficient to rob a beam of all power to act upon their vapours. This idea, enter-
tained though not expressed, has not been verified, and the deportment of iodide of
allyl may be taken as representative of a class of facts which contradict it. Glass cells were employed varying from one-eighth of an inch to an inch in width. Filled with the transparent iodide, these cells were placed between the electric lamp and
the experimental tube charged with the iodide vapour.
