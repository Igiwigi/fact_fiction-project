are much more frequent than large impactors), the only known example is the aforementioned 2

The transition from shallow-water to deep-water impacts is gradual. It is linked to the _
inetic energy of the impactor and, therefore, depends on the composition of the projectile : Ss
(iron meteorites penetrate deeper into the water than similar-sized stony meteorites at the same DNS
velocity). Furthermore, the impact angle is important. Generally, the higher the impact velocity : =
U and steeper the angle a, the deeper the projectile penetrates into the water column (an impact £8

velocity of U=18kms~! and a = 45° are the most likely parameters). The intermediate regime
between shallow-water and deep-water impacts may range from L/ = 1 to L/h = 0.17, where L is
the projectile diameter and h is the water depth [9].

In fact, the vast majority of impacts occur at an oblique impact angle. However, the most often
studied case (experimentally and through numerical models) is the very unlikely vertical strike
of a bolide (figure 1). In a vertical impact, the perfect cylindrical symmetry, where the collapse
of the transient cavity occurs in all radial directions at the same time, causes an implausibly
high central jet of water (figure 1IIla and IVb), that later collapses to drive an outward going
wave. No impact is truly vertical, and even in a slightly oblique impact the inrushing water
does not meet exactly at the centre, spoiling the high symmetry needed to produce the kind
of jet illustrated in figure 1. Full three-dimensional simulations do not show this effect (e.g.
[2,37,38]) as the collapse in the downrange direction starts a little later than in the uprange
direction, which causes deviations from perfect symmetry. An example of a simulation of an
oblique impact is shown in figure 2. However, such models are computationally expensive and
systematic studies on the effect of the impact angle on the height of the central splash are
lacking, yet.
