There are four such equations. The determinant of the coefficients on the left hand

usual equation
sides is denoted by A, and the cofactor of one of its terms by Ax. Solving for @,,'

We have also an equation expressing the fact that ), and ,y (the first approximations

to VY, and Y,y) are orthogonal.
This and the four equations like (3.7) give the determinant equation—a cubic in 8H'
= 0.
