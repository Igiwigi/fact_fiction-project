In planning the error control a certain degree of overestimation of the sampling error can
often be tolerated. Naturally, also, by no means the whole of the material need be covered.
In large-scale investigations it is only rarely that estimates of the sampling error are made
from the whole of the material, even when the method of sampling is such that fully valid
estimates are possible. Nevertheless some degree of control—analogous to quality control
of an industrial product—is always advisable.

When, for one reason or another, random sampling is considered preferable to systematic
sampling, there remains the question of whether such sampling should be two units per
block or one unit per block. The only advantage of random sampling of two per block is
that an estimate of error is automatically available for every part of the material if required,
but this is not a very cogent reason if such estimates are not in fact computed. If, as is usual
in extensive sampling, some form of error control is all that is required, it may well be better
to use random sampling of one per block, supplementary observations at randomly located
points being taken in a sufficient proportion of the blocks to give adequate error control.
An alternative procedure, in material in which the block divisions are arbitrary, i.e. virtually
located at random, is to estimate the error mean squares of differences of terms 5 = 1, 2,3, ...,
d—1, units apart from differences between terms in neighbouring blocks, building up the
mean square within blocks of d from the formula given in §2(a). Ifdis at all large, however,
the mean squares for small s, which have greatest weight in the final estimate, may not be
sufficiently accurately determined without some supplementary observations. These obser-
vations may be located so as to give information only on the differences for small s. Extra-
polation from higher values of s may also occasionally be used, though this is inadvisable if
