The following will, I think, show that no error need be feared in the solution which
has just been obtained. The value of V,, if obtained accurately, ought to satisfy V’°V; = —4zp, and the term
—4rp must come entirely from the terms independent of ¢ in V, Thus the terms in
V, which are multiplied by e, ¢? and e* ought separately to be spherical harmonics. It was verified in the previous paper that the terms in e and e* were in actual
fact of this form, The terms in e* will be harmonic if the quantity on the right of
equation (57) is harmonic, and the conditions for this are expressed by the equations

I have inserted the values just obtained for ty, t», ...0;, ... in these equations, and
have verified that they are all satisfied. (The necessary transformations of the various
integrals are tedious, but involve no special difficulties.)

Tt follows that the solution we have obtained gives accurately the potential of some
solid of uniform density p. By the method explained in the earlier sections of the
previous paper, it is easy to work the problem backwards and to verify that the
equation of the boundary of the solid in question is obtained by putting X = 0 in the
equation /+¢ = 0. Thus we verify that our solution gives accurately the potential
of the solid of boundary
