can be enlarged into K(0,2), for a new direction @ and slightly larger 8, which can be shown to
be 6 =2/2 — (2/2 — 0), for a universal jz. Therefore, once we prove (5.3), then an iteration (by
considering iteratively 2u(x/2*)) will give us a sequence of cone improvements K(6x, ex), in By-x,
with 0; = 1/2 — w(—1 — 1/2) =-+» = 2/2 — w*(x — 6). This in turn implies cle regularity at the
origin. As this holds with same constant in a uniform neighbourhood of the origin, we obtain
C!-regularity of the free boundary.

(b) Interior gain on monotonicity

To complete our heuristic proof, we need to prove the implication (5.3). To explain this
geometrically, we consider a point z = (3/4)e, right above the origin. Then the half-space IT, :=
{x - Vu(z) > 0} contains the cone of monotonicity K(9, en). All directional derivatives in directions
v, that go into the half space are of course positive at z, in fact as they go strictly into the half space,

‘This is a consequence of the boundary Harnack inequality.


away from the edge of 7; they become strictly positive at z, proportionally to ¢(|Vu(z)|, where t
is the distance of v to the edge of J7,. On the other hand, if the direction happens to be also in the
cone of monotonicity, it is non-negative everywhere in our domain, say in a cylinder centred at
the origin. Therefore, from Harnack inequality, the directional derivatives that are inside the cone
are not only positive but comparable to ¢|Vu(z)| in, say, half the original cylinder.

Finally, if the direction v is at the edge of the cone, but strictly inside /7, being of size t\v|, it
forces positivity in a full neighbourhood of directions of size f.
