ever be foreign /to the plan of the, present communication to
enter into any speculations, on this subject, and I shall there-
fore only remark, that the influence of the nervous system
does not appear to be necessary to the production of the che-
mical changes, which the blood undergoes in consequence of
exposure to the air in the lungs.*

* This conclusion is directly contrary to that deduced by M, DururYTxEx, from

a $eries of curious experiments, made with a view to ascertain the effects which follow
+ the division of the nerves of the par vagum, and it is an object of some importance in

the present investigation, to ascertain in what manner the apparently opposite facts,

observed by M. DuruyTREn and myself, are to be reconciled with each other.

It was observed by this physiologist, that in an animal, in which both the nerves
of the par yagum are divided, the blood returned from the lungs has a darker co-
lour than natural, and that the animals, on whom this. operation is performed, die
$0oner or later with symptoms of asphyxia, notwithstanding the air continues to enter
the lungs; and hence he concludes, that the changes which are produced on the blood
in respiration are not the result of a mere chemical process, but are dependent on the
nervous influence, and cease to take place when the communication between the lungs
and the brain is destroyed.
