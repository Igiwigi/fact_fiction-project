There can, however, be little doubt that the organ is thrown, by the passage of an
induction shock through its substance, into a state of prolonged excitation which
slowly passes off, and, if this is so, then the rapid development of a large nerve-
organ response must, if sufficiently intense, be itself capable of throwing the tissue

into a state of prolonged excitation, Now it is only in cases of very vigorous response
to nerve excitation that the peculiar prolongation of the response referred to in Part IT.
is seen. There is thus every reason to suppose that this prolonged change is the same,
whether its precursor be an induction shock or the shock of the nerve-organ response
itself. The fact that in the one case the tissue is quiescent, whilst in the other it is
in a state of functional activity, does not really affect the matter. The experiments on
summation to be now referred to show that the tissue is capable of responding to two
stimuli occurring within 01” of each other, and that an after-effect may be procured
even when the tissue is in a state of activity by leading an induction shock through
the organ *02” after a response has been evoked by excitation of its nerve. To these
experiments we now turn.

Summation of effects—Before proceeding to experiments designed to show the
summation of after-effects, it was first necessary to obtain satisfactory proof of the
summation of two successive nerve-organ responses produced by two successive
excitations of its nerve. It was found that the results were not satisfactory if the
second stimulus followed the first at a very short interval, and was applied to the
