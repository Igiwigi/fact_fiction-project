We have no direct proof of the completeness of synthesis, but the hydrogen
residues were sparked at different pressures and for varying periods of time without
affecting the results. The measured volume of hydrogen left in the pipette at the
end of a determination was usually removed by the mercury pump, but in
experiments 7,8 and 9 of series 4, it was transferred to the explosion vessel and

constituted the first hydrogen filling of the succeeding experiment.* The results
show no indication of an accumulating impurity. ’

The successful removal of water from the hydrogen residue was proved by the fact
that the small phosphoric oxide tube between the explosion vessel and the pump showed
no signs of deliquescence after four years’ use.

Accuracy of Volume, Pressure, and Temperature Measurements.

Owing to the fact that all gas measurements were made in the same vessel under
the same conditions, various possible errors in this category tend to cancel out.

Volume errors.—Since all volumes were measured in terms of a weight of mercury,
an accuracy greater than necessary was readily secured. The only operation in which
special care was needed to prevent a volume error was the setting of the meniscus
to the point in the dead-space. The final adjustment was always made with a
