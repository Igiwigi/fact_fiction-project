In all instances of conversion of force, as already no-
ticed, some form of matter is required as the medinm of the metamorphosis; and a
Slight change in the condition of that matter may have a very considerable effect in
modifying the process of conversion. "Thus, it is by causing an electric current to
circulate around a bar of iron, that we most readily develope the magnetic force ;
but the molecular condition of that iron, whether hard or soft, erystalline or fibrous,
has an important influence upon the result. Now we know that the norwal condi-
tion of the nerve-fibre can only be kept up by the continual performance of the
changes which constitute nutrition ; $0 that if these changes be interrupted, its mo-
lecular condition speedily undergoes alteration. Hence, the fact that the electric
force can no longer call forth the manifestations of nervous force, when a short time
bas elapsed aſter the suspension of the nutritive processes by the stoppage of the
circulation, is in no way inconsistent with the idea here advocated of the intimate
relation between the two. In order to complete the idea of © correlation,” however, it mnst be shown that the
nervous force may be the means of developing electricity; and it seems the only
feasible method of accounting for the results of the experiments of Davy, Faravay,
Marreveci, and others, upon the Electric Fishes, to look upon the development of
electricity as the result of the action of their neryous force upon the peculiar organic
apparatus to which its production is attributed. For the electric power has been
ascertained to be entirely dependent upon the connection of that apparatus with
the nervous centres, by nerve-trunks of large 8ize, whose branches are distributed
with extraordinary minuteness through the ultimate sabdivisions of the electric or-
gans; if these nerves be wholly divided, the electric discharge can no longer be called
forth in the usnal mode; if they be partially divided, the electric power is propor-
tionably weakened ; if the © electric lobe” of the encephalon be destroyed, removed,
or injured, the electric power is annihilated or weakened, in precise accordance with
the degree of damage inflicted ; whilst, on the other hand, if the © electric lobe” be
