cortical connectivity

There are multiple thalamocortical mechanisms that can
modulate the gain of prediction error in superficial layers of
the cortex. Here, we consider three possible mechanisms
through which the pulvinar contributes to gain control:
(i) induction of phase synchrony across presynaptic neurons
within a cortical region, perhaps achieved by (ii) modulation
of low-frequency (alpha) oscillation across cortical regions
and (iii) modulation of prediction error units in the superficial
layers via diffuse projections.

The first mechanism reflects the fact that synchronized
presynaptic spikes generally make the postsynaptic impact
stronger. Thus, controlling the degree of synchrony at presyn-
aptic neurons can serve as a gain control mechanism [59,60].
This can be achieved by synchronous modulation of subthres-
hold membrane potentials at the gamma frequency [61].
While gamma oscillations can be generated by intracortical
mechanisms, the thalamus plays a role in modulating
gamma oscillations in sensory cortex. For example, it has
been shown that stimulation of the posterior intralaminar
nucleus modulates synchronous gamma oscillations in the
auditory cortex [62]. Extending this notion to the visual
cortex, one may speculate that the pulvinar could modulate
