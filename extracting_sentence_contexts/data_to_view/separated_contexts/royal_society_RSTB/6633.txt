Five of the six explants of region E
formed no cartilage (fig. 20c, Plate 36) but a small nodule developed in the sixth. These results define the posterior border of the sternal tissue still more precisely. The fact that one explant of region E developed a little cartilage whilst all those of
region D formed cartilage shows that the posterior boundary of the presumptive sternal
tissue lies near the third intersomitic septum behind the wing bud. Conclusion. The posterior border of the presumptive sternal tissue is near the level
of the third intersomitic septum behind the wing bud.
