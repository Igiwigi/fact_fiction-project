GEMS are abundant
in some cometary samples and GEMS transform to Fe-rich olivine when heated at greater than
or equal to 900Â°C, so cometary materials could be a source of precursor materials for chondrule
formation. The mere size difference between submicrometre-sized GEMS and 210m sized Fe-
rich olivine grains have been one argument against this idea. Shocks may compact aggregates and
in fact this is required to have the correct opacity for the fast cooling rates needed for chondrule-
formation in shocks [254]. Also, some cometary dust collections like UCAMMs have abundant
carbon, which is suggested to be a critical reducing agent to drive the oxygen fugacity down in
regions of type I chondrule formation. We suggest that cometary primitive materials be not only
considered to be possible products of chondrule-formation but also considered as contributors to
the precursor reservoir of type II chondrule-formation.
