the disadvantage in genetic fitness that accrues from reprodu-
cing sexually versus asexually. To rescue this, we must give
precedence to the observation that, in fact, sexual reproduction
is extremely common and an adequate explanatory model is
an ugly conglomeration of multiple simple and beautiful
hypotheses. Each hypothesis on its own seems elegant and
yet unable to explain the data. Altogether, these hypotheses
may be sufficient, as described by Nick Lane, a fellow of the
Royal Society, in his book Life Ascending [129]. In fact, this
book received an award from the Royal Society, which is
sponsoring this issue.

Similarly, in metabolic scaling, the 3/4-power law of
metabolism has become the proposed universal law and, as
Douglas Glazier discusses [130], many hypotheses have been
generated over the past 80 years or more to explain this scaling.
Nevertheless, there remains no consensus as to which model is
most valid. Glazier argues that aspects of all these models,
dependent on the contextual situation of the organism in ques-
tionâ€”for example, surface area-related fluxes of resources and
wastes (including heat), internal resource transport, system
