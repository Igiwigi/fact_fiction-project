the motion being perpendicular in both cases.

“Tt should be noted, in connection with this eruption, that at 2.40 p.m. on the same day, at the
island of St. Thomas, there was a severe earthquake, followed by an enormous tidal wave, fully 50 feet
high, and that there was concurrently a volcanic outbreak at the neighbouring island of Little Saba,
which emitted smoke and lava.”

Though both the writers of the original articles and of the handbook appear to
have thought that the disturbance referred to was due to some voleanic action in or
about the Green Hole, it is clear to anyone carefully reading the records or the above
summary that the actual fact was a tidal wave originating in the neighbourhood of
Little Saba and St. Thomas, and affecting in a less degree the shores of the island of
Grenada.

The harbour of St. George was really less severely affected than other parts. The
Green Hole is probably a submerged cave extending some distance underground, and
the water in it rushed out when the level of the water in the carenage was lowered
by the tidal wave. It is almost inconceivable that a voleanie outburst should have
taken place from the Green Hole at the exact moment when the water in the
carenage was lowered, and yet have ceased so suddenly as to have allowed the hole
to be filled up by the action of the waves which followed immediately afterwards.

If the temperature of the water had been taken by a thermometer, as was done by
