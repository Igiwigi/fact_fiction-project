inter-repeat duplexes and a pseudoknot. The lack of consensus
in these studies highlighted the need for methods for direct
RNA structure analysis.

(c) Direct determination of A-repeat structure by cross-
linking

Conventional structure probing methods produce one-
dimensional flexibility /accessibility profiles and the resulting
structure models are often built with low accuracy. Several
major problems plague these methods, including the ambigu-
ity in the strength of reactivity (ie. not a black and white
difference), the size limit of the modelling and the fact that
the base pairing relationships are based on prediction instead
of direct experimental evidence [54]. To overcome these pro-
blems associated with chemical and enzymatic probing, Lu
et al. [10] developed a new method, PARIS (Psoralen Analysis
of RNA Interactions and Structures), for direct determination
of base pairing helices in living cells. In addition, Lu et al. also
used an improved in vivo click (ic)SHAPE chemical, NAI-N3,
for structure probing [58]. The PARIS data showed that the
A-repeat region forms an isolated domain with little contact
with the rest of the RNA (figure 1a). Within the A-repeat
domain, repeat units base pair with each other, forming a
family of inter-repeat helices that are often alternative to one
