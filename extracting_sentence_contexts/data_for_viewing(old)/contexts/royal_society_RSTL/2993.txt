sarily ought also to coincide with observation, is widely in
error, It seems therefore very obvious that some disturb-
ing cause exists, but whether any part of it can be attributed
to the rotation of the earth is, notwithstanding the preceding
results, very doubtful ; at the same time I may perhaps be
allowed to observe, that one of the essential conditions for
the production of such an effect has place in the earth, viz.
that it does not revolve about its polarized axis ; and if the
inductive principle through which it receives its magnetism
be exterior to itself, then it would follow almost of necessity
that some such an effect should take place. I beg however
to be understood as advancing nothing in this letter, beyond
the mere experimental fact above stated, which, even if it
should find no useful application, may perhaps be thought
sufficiently curious to be recorded,in the Transactions of the
Royal Society.
