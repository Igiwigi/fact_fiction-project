Observe that, since E; = By x ux, the energy bound in (3.9) is not enough to put us in this setting. On the other hand, for instance if we assume uniform bounds on (u,), (Bx) in L3, then (Ex) is
bounded in L*/? and the div-curl lemma applies. A closely related result in [52] is that in fact for
any weak solution of (3.8) with u,B €L> magnetic helicity is a conserved quantity. In terms of
the general framework sketched in §2 this implies that in the L3 (and in particular the bounded)
setting the relaxed constitutive set K’ has empty interior, because necessarily B - E = 0. Conversely,
adding this condition to (3.12) leads to a relaxation of ideal MHD which is consistent with the
Woltjer—-Taylor theory, and in particular to the following result in [51]:
