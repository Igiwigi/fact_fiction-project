This implies that this point is more of a co-dimension point between shear-thinning
and moderately elastic fluids. Instead, point ‘2’ in figure 7 illustrates all TVF, RSW, and EIT and
is closer to the TP point discussed earlier. The fact that point ‘2’ (TP) lies outside the overlapping
region of ID, ED and INT implies a distorted shape of the graph due to experimental inaccuracies
and inconsistencies. An open matter is still the nature of EIT as it consists of both inertial and elastic effects. The
indications so far point toward a strong similarity between EIT and ET [118,151].
