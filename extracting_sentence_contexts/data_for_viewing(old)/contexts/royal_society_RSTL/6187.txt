the reaction doubtless consisting in the transformation,

I should not omit to mention, however, that the production of iodide of yinyl (C, H, 1)
was not demonstrated by a special experiment. There was some probability of an
iodethylated triethylphosphonium-compound being formed by the action of iodide of
phosphorus on the chloride or iodide of the oxethylated metal ; but these bodies do not
act on one another.

HrBRIDs of ETHYLENE-DIPHOSPHONIUM.

In a former paragraph, I mentioned as a fact of peculiar interest, the formation of

the dibromide of hexethylated ethylene-diphosphonium by the reaction

The study of this reaction naturally led me to try that of trimethylphosphine on
the bromide of bromethylated triethylphosphonium, which I had a right to expect would
thus be converted into the dibromide of ethylene-trimethyl-triethyldiphosphonium :
