In either of these two coarsening schemes the
partitions can be ordered in some way, and the respective expanded systems then become

1 1 1 1 1 =
Ri | Riv | | Rw | c= Ry | Rav | | Rysor | c=

2 2. 2, 2. 2 =
RU | Rav | | Raw | ¢=2 and | RF | Raw | | Riso | o=2
qo oq’ gia | R qq ga” | RY

Remark 3.3. Although the number of the states (combinations of the values of the elements)
of the bunch R° in R’ and especially in R” is very large, the support of each bunch (the set of
the states with non-zero probabilities) has the same size as that of the initial random variable Ri
in R (i.e. in our example, it cannot exceed 5). This follows from the facts that each event Ri =x
uniquely defines the state of R° in R’ and in R”, and that }>, Pr [Rj =x] =1.

(b) Dichotomizations and canonical/split representations

Definition 3.4. A dichotomization of a set V is a function f : V > {0,1}. Applying such an f to
an rv R with the set of possible values V, we get a binary rv f(R).
