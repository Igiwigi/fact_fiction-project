the trae law could only, in fact, arise from the minute residual quantity of the more
extinguisbable rays existing at great thicknesses ; quantities 80 small that the law of
their variation would be lost in the errors of observation.

ation. Suppose solar light to be incident upon intensely red glass: at very minute
thicknesses soime part of eyery kind of light will, no doubt, pass through, but we know
that the old veneered homogeneous glass transmits pure red light, even when it is
very thin indeed.
