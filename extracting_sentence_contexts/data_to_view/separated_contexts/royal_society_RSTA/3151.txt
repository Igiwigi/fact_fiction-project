It can be checked that
&5(t0)Ztw is still a travelling wave. As e784 €5(t +19 +5,t +8) e = E(t + 19,7), it follows that
e% E(t +s) e** = E4(19). In fact, using arguments similar to the ones in [22], one can show
e% &(s) isa group with the infinitesimal generator (1/c)D A(Xtw) — 91 = £. In other words,

eS €5(s) =exp (: ( (PAG) - *)) = exp(sL).

5. Splitting of the zero eigenvalue

Recall that the spectrum of £ has a double eigenvalue for any velocity c in the family of solitary
travelling wave solutions such that H’(c) 4 0.
