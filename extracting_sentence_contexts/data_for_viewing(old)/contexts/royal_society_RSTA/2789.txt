Group SO(3, R) is a symmetry group of this system. In fact, its dynamics does not depend on
the orientation of the inertial frame because all constraints are invariant with respect to the natural
action of SO(3,R) in R°. Thus, the total angular momentum

It is difficult to perform efficient analysis of the described system because even for small n
the analytical form of equations of motion in terms of any reasonable parametrization is very
complicated. This is why we decided to derive equations of motion in a different way.
