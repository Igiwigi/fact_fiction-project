where p(a’, b’) = (a’ |b’) (b' |a’) is the invariant through which (a’ | b’) gains physical meaning. One 18

naturally expects the result of an intervening measurement to produce a fraction of the ensemble
introduced at the beginning of this composition of measurements.

The expectation value of property A for systems in the state b’ is the average of the possible
values of A, weighted by the probabilities of occurrence that are characteristic of the state b’; one
can write the probability formula as

pla’, b’) = tr M(a’ M0’). (3.13)

The additivity of p(a’,b’) and the fact that )°,, p(a’, b’) = 1, which follows from this, shows p(a’, b’)
to be stochastic, establishing the core of its interpretation as the probability that a’ is observed
in the measurement of A of a system just previously measured to be in state b’, with first
selective measurement of B playing the role of state preparation. In order to completely qualify the
probability interpretation, the requirement mentioned above that (b’ | a’) and (a’ | b’)* are complex
conjugate numbers that establishes the non-negativity of p(a’, b’) requires that A(a’)* = 2(a’)~! and
so, significantly, requires them to take the form

aa’) =e, (3.14)

in which the values of the real numbers ¢(q’), i.e. phases, importantly are unrestricted and so all
possible, a point taken up in detail in §5.
