"The results of my experiments were quite in conformity with Professor TroMsoN's
view as to the smallness of the resistance to conduction through the thickness of the
metal compared with the resistance at the surfaces of the tubes through the closely
adhering film of fluid. I therefore sought to discover in each instance the entire con-
ductivity by the formula
