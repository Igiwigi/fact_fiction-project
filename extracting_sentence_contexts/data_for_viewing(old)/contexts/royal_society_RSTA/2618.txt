non-isothermal diffusion across multiple boundaries within populations of crystals has been
modelled, essentially by choosing two or more isothermal steps and solving for combination
of durations that reproduce the combined profiles [24,28]. It is also possible to use numerical
methods to construct forward models of diffusion during arbitrary thermal histories, in order
to explore the magnitude of the effect on diffusion of particular changes in thermal conditions
(e.g. [15]). This type of numerical approach can also be useful in assessing the extent to which
simultaneous growth and diffusion has modified measured profiles (e.g. [15,26,27]). Petrological
modelling (e.g. R-MELTS) can also provide some insights and constraints on intensive variables
(e.g. temperature, water content, oxidation state) that can be used to define appropriate conditions
for diffusion modelling (e.g. [29,30])

Finally, sectioning effects can lead to substantial inaccuracies in modelled diffusion durations.
These arise from the fact that, in practice, compositional variations are typically measured as 1D
profiles across random 2D slices of 3D crystals, and profiles are modelled assuming diffusion
in one dimension. This can lead to significant inaccuracies compared to considering the full
complexity of 3D diffusion, even once the effects of non-isotropic diffusion are accounted for
[31,32]. Depending on the location and orientation of the measured profile, such effects can lead
to either overestimation or underestimation of the true diffusion time, for example by factors of
0.2-10 for olivine [32]. One implication of these results is that 1D modelling of profiles measured
across multiple randomly-oriented crystals would be expected to produce a spread of model



diffusion ages of a factor of 5-10, even in the case where all crystals are recording the same
duration of diffusion [32]. In cases where one or more of the key variables is poorly constrained, or
