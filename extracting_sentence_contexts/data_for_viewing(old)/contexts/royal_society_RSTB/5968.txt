The variation in form may be appreciated by comparing the different specimens
side by side, and to facilitate comparison the figures accompanying the subsequent
descriptions are drawn on the same scales. The complete specimens are shown twice
magnified, while the drawings of individual cupules show them enlarged five times.
With a few exceptions, the figures of the cuticles were made directly from photomicro-
graphs with a magnification of 120 diameters.

The present state of our knowledge of cuticle structure certainly indicates that
distinct differences in the form of the epidermal cells may be taken as an indication
that we are dealing with distinct forms of plants, but these differences do not show
whether such forms are to be regarded as distinct genera, species, or varieties.

Tn view of the fact that a considerable number of different forms of leaves occur in
the same bed which must be regarded as derived from the same type of plants which
furnished our female inflorescences, it would appear likely that we have to deal with
a number of species. The best plan seems therefore to describe as separate species
those forms which appear to be readily distinguishable and are represented in my
collection by fairly complete material, and to add notes on the other specimens which
are not so complete or so well defined.

Tt is proposed to divide the specimens in the present collection into three genera,
distinguishable by the form and character of the cupules; the study of the cuticle
structure of the axis and cupules supports this division. Umkomasia has a two-lobed
