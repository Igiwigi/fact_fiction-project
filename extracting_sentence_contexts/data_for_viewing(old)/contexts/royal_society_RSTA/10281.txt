Lerpniz was restrained from assimilating his ideas more closely to Concept III. by a
prejudice against anything, so analogous to a point of space, moving—a prejudice
which arises from confusing the classical dualistic concept with the monistic concepts.
It is of course essential that at least some members of the class of objective reals
should have different relations to each other at different instants. Otherwise we are
confronted with an unchanging world. Concept V. is another Leibnizian monistic
concept.

The Time-Relation.—In every concept a dyadic serial relation, having for its field
the instants of time and these only, is necessary. The properties of this Zime-
Relation form the pure science of chronology. The time-relation is, in all concepts, a
serial relation ordinally similar to the serial relation which generates the series of
negative and positive real numbers.* This fact need not be further specified during
the successive consideration of the various concepts, nor need any of the propositions
of pure chronology be enunciated.

Definition.—The class of instants of time is always denoted by T in every concept.

The Essential Relation.—In every concept at least all the propositions of geometry
will be exhibited as properties of a single polyadic relation, here called the essential
relation. The field of the essential relation will consist, either of the whole class of
ultimate existents (¢.g., in Concepts IIL, [Vz. and V.), or of part of the class of
objective reals together with the instants of time (¢.g., in Concept IVa.), or of the
whole class of objective reals (¢.g., in Concept IL.), or of part of the class of objective
