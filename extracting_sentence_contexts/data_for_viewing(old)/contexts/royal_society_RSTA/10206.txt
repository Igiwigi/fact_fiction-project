refractive power would depend upon the amounts of combined water, and therefore
upon the cubes of the ionic dimensions.

These @ priori considerations have, in fact, turned out to be justified, not merely
qualitatively, but with considerable numerical accuracy, having regard to the difficulty
of some of the approximations involved. We are able to express the Hittorf
numbers, the densities, the effective molecular freezing-point depressions and the
equivalent refractive power within the limits of experimental error, as simple functions
of the radions, and to express the viscosities, with a fair approach to accuracy, not
merely as a function of the radions of the solute, but also upon the extended
conception of the radion as being simply proportional to the radion, or average
molecular radius, of the whole solution. Our hypothesis has also enabled us to
discover new relations which are independent of the hypothesis, viz., the fact that
the Hittorf migration numbers are a linear function of (B+/7")™, and the fact that
the effective molecular freezing-point depression and the equivalent refractive power
are linear functions of the solution volume.

It is submitted that the above considerations justify the working hypothesis, that
the function which we have named the radion, derived as above described, may in
fact be taken to be a measure of the actual sizes of the ions. In any case, the radion
turns out to be of fundamental importance in correlating the various phenomena of
solution.
