warrant the belief that in absolute measurements the chief difficulty will lie in the
determination of the quantity of air passed, rather than in the amount of water
vapour it carries.

The research is divided into two parts. In Part I. are given the measurements of
the compressibilities of the solutions; these were carried out with the aid of
Dr. Burton. Part II. embodies the experiments on the vapour pressures of solutions
of cane sugar and a-methyl glucoside at 0° C. and 30° C., also some determinations of
the vapour pressures of dilute sulphuric acid. All the experiments, except a few
dating later than January 22, 1916, were done in conjunction with Mr. Harriry.

As both these gentlemen have left the laboratory and are not within reach, the
other author should be held responsible for all mistakes in presentation of fact or
theory.

PART, ier
Tue Compressisiiities, (BERKELEY and Burton.)

In a previous communication we have given the results of our measurements on the
compressibilities of calcium ferrocyanide solutions. These results were not very
satisfactory because the experiments had to be carried out as rapidly as possible,
otherwise the prolonged strain on the outer glass tubet (through which the readings
on the piezometer stem were taken) soon caused it to collapse.

New Apparatus.—To obviate this, a new apparatus, A, was designed in which the
