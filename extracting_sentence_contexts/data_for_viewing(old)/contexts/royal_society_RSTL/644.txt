imagine that I could have been so easily deceived. For nothing
surely is easier, than to distinguish the motion of a solid'suspended
in a liquid of the same-specitic gravity, which is carried along
by a current in the liquid, from that of a body which descends,
or ascends, in the liquid, in consequence of its relative weight,
or levity. In the one case, the motion is uniform; in the other,
it is accelerated. In a current, the body may be carried forward
in all directions; and even in curved lines; but, when it falls in
a quiescent fluid, by the action of gravity, or rises, in conse-
quence of its being specifically lighter than the fluid, it must
necessarily move-in a vertical direction.

The fact is, that I very often -observed, in the course of my
numerous experiments, the motions of small particles of matter,
of different kinds, in water, which Dr.. THomson describes;
but, 80 far from inferring from them the existence of currents in
that fluid, their-cause was $0 per≈øectly evident, that I did not
even think it necessary to make any mention of them.

Royal Society would excuse the liberty I have taken in troubling
them with these remarks. Very desirous of avoiding every spe-
