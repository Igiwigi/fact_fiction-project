Opinions, however, differ as to
the homologues of certain elements, notably the teeth. Sonnas (1899) puts forward the
view that (1) the alveoli are transformed first adambulacrals (mouth-angle plates),
(2) the tooth represents the odontophore which has acquired a persistent root, (3)
the epiphyses correspond to the first ambulacral ossicles, adding, “ the radius and the
rotula remain problematical.”

On the assumption that the first cone is similar to the succeeding ones (7.e., of double
origin), DEVANESEN (1922, p. 479) writes, ““ The homologues of the urchin tooth are
to be looked for among the bristles carried by the mouth-angle plates in star-fishes. If two such bristles get flattened, assume a cone-shape and are pushed between the

mouth-angle plates, thus becoming partially internal, we have the rudiments of an
urchin tooth.” Moreover, he puts forward the suggestion that the rotule may be
modified odontophores, but admits that the great impediment to this view is the fact
that, while the latter are interambulacral, the former are ambulacral. It is very
unlikely that five single inter-radial ossicles (odontophores) should have, in the course of
“evolution, assumed a radial position. Therefore Sonuas’ view—that the tooth is an
odontophore which has acquired a persistent root—is preferable.
