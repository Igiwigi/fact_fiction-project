Do we understand development? To a large extent it is legitimate to say that modern embryology has rediscovered the theories
of epigenesis and design proposed by Aristotle. Today, in fact, there is a virtually universal
consensus on the idea that embryonic development is the result of a genetic programme and of epigenetic
processes. This may give the impression that we now understand, at least in principle, the logic of
embryonic development, and all that remains to be done is to fill in the details. In The Problems of
Biology, however, Maynard Smith [6, pp. 99-100] lucidly sounded a note of caution against this
attitude:

It is popular nowadays to say that morphogenesis (that is the development of form) is
programmed by the genes.
