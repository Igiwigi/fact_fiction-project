Why are they so becomes more complex, programmers rely more frequently on
close, despite the obvious dissimilarities to be expected duplication (also known as cloning), since they know from
from different engineering projects? The response is provided experience that these structures are quite stable and behave
through two arguments. One is the known fact that software well. Empirical analysis of software evolution confirms that
projects, as much as they are planned and serve to a given duplicate codes are more stable than non-duplicated
objective, are developed by engineers who create a system codes [71]. In this way, the software dependency network
that grows over time.
