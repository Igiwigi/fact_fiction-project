D b), and one which it shares with
the other sections of the 8ame embryo, is the appearance of connective-tissue cells around
the nerve-rudiment. 'These cells arise from two sources; one of these is 8upplied by
the vertebral rudiments, which at the end of the last stage (Plate 16. fig. C, vr) become
split off from the inner layer of the muscle-plates. The vertebral rudiments have
in fact commenced to grow up on each side of the neural canal, in order to form the
mass of cells out of which the neural arches are subsequently developed. The dorsal extremities of the muscle-plates form the second source of these con-
nectiye-tissue cells. These latter cells lie dorsal and external to the nerve-rudiments.
