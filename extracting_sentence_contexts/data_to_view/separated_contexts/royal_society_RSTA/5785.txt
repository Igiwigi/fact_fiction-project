Proceeding now as in [30], the control introduced in (2.12) can be
solved explicitly giving

Now, in the presence of the above described microscopic controlled interactions, one can
consider as before the construction of a kinetic collisional equation for what concerns the

where we recall that the frequency of interaction has been chosen such that B(x) =1/x. Then,
thanks to the passage to the grazing limit one can show that the controlled kinetic model converges
to a Fokker—Planck type equation which contains an additional drift term, that quantifies the role
of the control mimicking lockdown measures. In fact, since by hypothesis « < 1, we can write
