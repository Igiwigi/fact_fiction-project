specimens collected by him exist at Kew and Paris. The specimen at Paris is,
in Some respects, better than the one at Kew, and through the kindness of Professor
E, Bureau it was lent to me for examination. This enabled me to ascertain that
the shape and attachment of the ovule are quite different from what obtains in
Juliana,

About the same period Joun MacLean, a merchant at Lima, sent specimens to
the late Sir Witttam Hooker, bearing male flowers, probably from the same :
locality, and possibly also collected by MaruEws, as he was at one time in the
employment of MacLean. The label accompanying the specimens bears the
following note :—“ Huaucui of the natives. Male flowers of dicecious shrub seldom
seen with leaves, and always black as if burnt or blasted.” MavHrws describes it
as a small tree. It is a singular fact that the types of both genera were first
collected about 75 years ago.

I should, perhaps, mention here that enlarged drawings, illustrative of the
structure of the flowers and fruits of the two genera, were exhibited at the Royal
Society's Conversazione on May 13, 1904, under the names of Amphipterygium
and Orthopterygium (Programme, p. 12). These names, as well as the term
Amphipterygiacee for the natural order, were taken up in various reports and
records, but I now, for reasons given above, think it better to return to Juliania,
and to call the order Julianiacez.

Juliania was founded in honour of JuLIAN CERVANTES, a priest and son of the
botanist, Vicente CERVANTES. Orthopterygium is derived from dpQos, straight,
