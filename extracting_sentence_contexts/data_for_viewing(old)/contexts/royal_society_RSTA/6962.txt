Mr H. L. Cox, of the Engineering Division, National Physical Laboratory, has investi-
gated by analytical methods the rather similar problem of finding the tensile stress in plates
containing long thin holes (figure 176), and found that there is a maximum principal stress
at a point P on the curved part of the boundary of the hole, greater than the stress at the
central point O by about 30 %. This analysis is not applicable to the problem of figure 17a,
and Cox suggested that Mathematics Division might obtain a solution to this problem by
relaxation methods.


368 L. FOX ON THE NUMERICAL SOLUTION

Photoelastic tests have also been carried out, but it is somewhat difficult to obtain con-
ditions of uniform loading, and experiment in fact prefers conditions of uniform displace-
ment. It is shown in §11 that the latter conditions are not ideal for relaxation, and it was
decided to replace the uniform displacement condition by one of uniform tensile loading
at the ends of the specimen.*

The relaxation problem involves the solution of the equation
