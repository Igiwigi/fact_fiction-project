Hamiltonian.

Owing to the presence of midgap bound states and OP suppression, the surface region can
have very different experimental signatures from those of the bulk phase. In confined geometry,
influence of the surface Andreev states is greatly enhanced because the small volume precludes
formation of bulk phases. As a result, a new part of the superfluid OP phase space can be
explored. Besides configurations that are trivially modified versions of the bulk states, several


new phases are expected to be the ground states in confined geometry. The new phases have
different symmetry properties that depend on the nature of the pairing interaction. In single-
component d-wave film spontaneous currents appear, breaking the time-reversal symmetry. The
currents are generated due to the fact that the bound states can lower their energy in the presence
of a superflow. In superfluid, the 9He multi-component nature of the condensate results in
the amplitude modulation of the OP in the plane of the film, breaking continuous translation
symmetry.

Recent experimental progress in manufacturing of nanometer-scale cells promise a new
window into extreme regimes of confinement, and a new approach to investigation of properties
of surface bound states and unconventional condensates. Superfluid 7He in confinement is a
particularly interesting system where multiple phenomena challenge our understanding, both
experimentally and theoretically. One question is whether or not additional phases may be

stabilized depending on the geometry and surface structure of the confining geometry. So far there : =
