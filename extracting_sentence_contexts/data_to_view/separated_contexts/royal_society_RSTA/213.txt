Cold antihydrogen: a new frontier
in fundamental physics

The year 2002 heralded a breakthrough in antimatter research when the first low energy
antihydrogen atoms were produced. Antimatter has inspired both science and fiction
writers for many years, but detailed studies have until now eluded science. Antimatter
is notoriously difficult to study as it does not readily occur in nature, even though our
current understanding of the laws of physics have us expecting that it should make up
half of the universe. The pursuit of cold antihydrogen is driven by a desire to solve this
profound mystery.
