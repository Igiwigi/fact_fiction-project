three carpels derived by condensation from a pinnate structure.

Tt seems to me that once this group of plants had evolved the carpel and the stamen—
the units on which cross pollinating influences could work—it was bound to evolve
various types of floral structure in which the essential units were arranged in different

ways on the axis which bore them. The fact that the carpels and stamens of the
Caytoniales were arranged very differently from those of any modern Angiosperm does
not seem to be of such fundamental importance as to separate them completely from
the group of plants now known as the Angiosperms.

The form of the fruits of the Caytoniales bears some slight resemblance to the ripe
fruits of some genera of the Menispermacee. Here the development of the fruit is
often accompanied by a great enlargement of the dorsal side, while the ventral side
elongates but little. In this way the stigma, which is at first produced at one side of
the apex, comes to occupy a position close to the stalk of the fruit. The figures given
by Diets of the fruits of Stephania abyssinica (Dill et Rich.) Wap,* and of Syrrheonema
fasciculatum Mrerst may be compared with the figures given above (text-figs. 3, 5).
This similarity may be casual, but it is worthy of note, for the presence of such a
