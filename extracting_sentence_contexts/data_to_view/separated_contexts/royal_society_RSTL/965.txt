In many bodies,
the magnitude of this dispersion of the axes is compara-
tively trifling, while in some, not otherwise remarkable for
a high ordinary or extraordinary dispersive power, it is
enormous, and must render all computation of the tints in
which it is not taken into consideration, completely erroneous;
and indeed obliterating almost every trace of the Newtonian
scale of colour. We have here, then, a new element, which
for the future must enter into all formulz of double refraction
pretending to rigour, and at the same time are presented with
another very striking instance of the inherent distinction be-
tween the differently coloured molecules of light, which, since
the time of NEwrTon, every new step in optical science has
tended to place in a stronger point of view. At the same time,
by the easy and complete explanation this principle affords
of all the more perplexing anomalies/in the tints, the theory
of alternate polarisation to which they were hitherto s0 pal-
pable and formidable an objection, stands relieved from every
difficulty, and may now be received as fully adequate to the
representation of all the phenomena of the polarised rings,
and entitled' to rank with the fits of  easy transmission and
reflection, as a general and simple physical law, In fact, if we
investigate by this theory a general analytical expression of
the tint developed for any position/and thickness of the plate,
taking this element into consideration, it will be found to. in-
clude all the phenomena, as far as they can be computed,


crystallized bodies on homogeneous light. 51
