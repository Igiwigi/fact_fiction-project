The principal
solution stands in the same relation to the ‘ Chaplygin set’ of solutions (in which the variables
q, / are separated) as the generating function for Legendre polynomials does to the harmonic
functions 7"P, (cos @) ; it is not, like this generating function, elementary, but it has a notably
wide domain of regularity in the variables q, ¢. A brief comparison may be added with other methods for determining hodograph
solutions (Legendre potentials or stream functions) which, as functions of g, 0, are multiple-
valued. There are, I think, essentially two of these which are analytically rigorous, and
applicable when pp~” — const. (i) The first, due to Bergman (1945, 1948), is to transform
the hodograph equation to the form

aw d2w

ane + aga t WFLA) = 0, (B)

where dis a suitably chosen function of g. (In fact, A = iv, where a is defined in (2:3) below.)
For a first approximation the term wF(A) is omitted, so that w can be an arbitrary harmonic
function of A, #, not necessarily single-valued. An exact solution is then obtained as a series
in which this first approximation is the first term. Now F(A) has a singularity at the value
of A corresponding to the sonic value q, of g; on this account the series cannot converge in
a domain including q,, and for q near q, it is at best slowly convergent. (ii) The other method
(Lighthill 1947; Cherry 1947; Goldstein, Lighthill & Craggs 1948; Tamada 1950) is to
