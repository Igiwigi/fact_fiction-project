Horizon. Supposing the ice to pursue the direction which it had previous to reaching
He fall, it would, at the end of a certain time, reach the point d *; but the ice is not
Zigid enough to do this, and the mass descends to e. Now if it be the viscosity of the
Dubstance which has carried it in a certain time from B to d, that same property ought,
Sne would think, to enable it to drop down the vertical de without breaking. But so far

Fiscosity of the substance.
