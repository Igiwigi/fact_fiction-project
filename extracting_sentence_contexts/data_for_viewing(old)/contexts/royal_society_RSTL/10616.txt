Calculation showed that a comparatively insignificant proportion of both the nitrogen
and the mineral constituents estimated to be annually supplied in the dung was
annually recovered in the increase of crop yielded; nor did the addition of the
ammonia-salts increase the produce 80 much as might have been expected. Tt seemed
desirable, therefore, to attempt to determine the degree, and the permanence, of the
effect of the large amounts of the nitrogen, and of the mineral constituents of the
manure, which were calculated not to be recovered in the increase of crop during the
years of the application, the greater part of which, at any rate, must be supposed. to
exist as residue within the 8oil. Further, s0 far as there would be a relatively greater
available residue of mineral constibuents than of nitrogen, it was to be snpposed that
the application of the ammonia-salts would greatly accelerate the recovery of them.

The main facts relating to the produce and the increase of the total mixed herbage
over the first 20 years were considered in detail in Part I. ; some reference was als
there made to the amounts of the nitrogen, and of the mineral constituents, taken up,
and these points will be more fully treated in Part III. It is, however, necessary in
order to render intelligible the conditions under which the botanical changes have
taken place, that the general results as to the produce, and some of its constituents,
should be briefly stated here ; and: we are now able to give them for 25 years, in five
out of the last 8ix of which second as well as firs crops were removed, the tendency
to exhaustion being thereby considerably accelerated.

Whether we look to the period of the application of the farmyard manure, or to
the sncceeding periods of six, six, and five subsequent years of the action of the
residue, there is a, considerable increase compared with the unmanured plot ; and there
