1162 MR. G. F. RODWELL ON THE EFFECTS OF HEAT ON CERTAIN

admitting the supposition that alloys are solidified solutions of one body in another
(12), this lessening of cohesion is nob difficult to explain. For ib is well known that
particles of matter of similar composition attract each other (cohesion) more readily, |
and with greater force, than particles of different, composition (adhesion), and hence
the homogeneous diffusion of one substance in another must make the molecular
attraction less than that of either body by itself. Hence, molecular motion is more
readily assimilated, and so0oner produces any given effect, sgnch as the fusion of the

mass.

14. It was thought that the same explanation would apply to the curious fact that
the five chlorobromiodides of silver, and the lead-silver iodide alloy, all commenced their
period of contraction on heating at a lower temperature than the iodide of silver, to
which substance alone can they owe their contraction on heating, but the regults
obtained with the copper-silver iodide alloys appear to discredit this.

15. For it is mosb noteworthy in this connexion to observe that while the iodide of
silver commences to contract considerably on heating, that is to pass from its crystalline
into its amorphous plastic condition, at 142% C., the five chlorobromiodides of silver,
the percentage of iodide of silver in which varies from 26-1692 to 739285, and the
lead-silver iodide alloy, the percentage of iodide of silver in which amounts to 33794,
all commence their contraction at 124? C., that is 18* C. lower, although the coefficients
of expansion of the associated bodies necessarily differ. It would thus appear
