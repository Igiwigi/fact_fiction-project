speciation gene flow. The best-supported model suggested a
divergence with at least occasional gene flow until 10 000 years
ago [71,72]. 5. Conclusion
Divergence with gene flow is a progressive process,
initiated by selection targeting local genomic regions and
expanding from there over time, eventually leading to geno-
mic and reproductive isolation [73,74]. The fact that the
divergence far exceeded intraspecific diversity suggests that
the genomic isolation among the sister species is largely com-
plete. Under speciation with gene flow, the distribution of
interspecific divergence values should contain information
about the temporal trajectory of the divergence process,
because the different parts of the genome can start to
accumulate divergent mutations only if these parts are iso-
lated from each other by selection [5]. The left-skewed
shape of the net divergence distribution Dxy with its long
tail suggests that the divergence process started with small Data accessibility. Whole-genome individual re-sequencing raw data are
