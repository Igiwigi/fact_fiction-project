The preceding investigation shows also that, if þ(z) denotes any function of ©, then

= for this theorem has been proved to be true when þ(#) is of the form Az”+Bu+Cw

iS dependent on the fact of whether þ(#) was or was not expressible in any particular form. S 33, The general property upon which the theorem (26) depends is that the symbols
