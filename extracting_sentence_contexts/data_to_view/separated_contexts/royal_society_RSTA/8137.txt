We have not yet determined the temperature distribution ; we have not yet in fact
imposed the condition of constant net flux for the integrated radiation of all frequencies. To make progress at this point we will assume that B, (¢) can be replaced by its two-term

All we can hope for in accordance with the general tenour of our approximations is
that (30) shall be satisfied exactly for t= 0 and for + large.
