In the course of my experiments on this subject, phenomena occurred which
led me to think that some noyel results might be obtained by instituting a
series of experiments on metallic salts, using as a Voltaic arrangement the
feeble power produced by the contact of small slips of different metals, with
Solutions of the common metallic salts. Operating in this manner, I could
readily detect very minute quantities of different metals, coat platina with
gold, silyer, copper, &c., or cover gold with a surface of these metals, and tin,
copper, brass, iron, &. Several of those facts I have been in the habit of
bringing forward and illustrating in my annual courses of lectures delivered
