In each case it would seem to me possible to start with the embryonic initial of the organ
in question (imaginary in the fossils) and to suppose it proceeding by a perverted develop-
ment to give a Leptostrobus valve. However, when the two-valved capsule is considered,
Cupressus and Cycas are to be left out, and the series of stages leading to the others become
more elaborate, particularly if one valve is really over the other. None of these comparisons
will be followed in detail because I can see no gain from it, but of course new facts might
make it worth while. A comparison with a bicarpellary ovary of an angiosperm is possible, but the differences
are great, particularly in pollination, which in Leptostrobus is Gymnospermous. The approach
to an Angiosperm capsule in this Gymnosperm genus does, however, remain interesting as
an early organ with much of the biological function of a closed ovary.
