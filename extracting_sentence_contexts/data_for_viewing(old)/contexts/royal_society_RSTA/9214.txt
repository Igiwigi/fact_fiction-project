link appears to be a normal associate with an e mesh.

Starting from §, there are four separations close to 17264 or e(—d,). The link
4611°32 is too much out to be introduced on its own account, but it forms part of a
mesh whose corresponding link is evidently c. It is taken as ¢(—d,) = 4610°52. A
displacement somewhere in 42644 producing 3°51 not only makes the long link e
correct, but with the disappearance of the —d, displacement on the preceding ¢ at the
same time makes the separation to 26698 a correct ~ link, The alternative formula
(No. 15) is on the supposition that the displacement is produced in the ¢ by 26,.
Perhaps we should stop at 33345 as the next link 14929, like the one referred to
above, is 7°70 too small. But the next e link is too small for e(—é,) by about the
same amount, and the two together have the appearance of a parallel inequality. The
abnormality however may possibly be due to the fact that the separations are due
to differences between one line by Eprr and VALENtA and others by Exner and
Hascnek. If this be granted the next comes right with e(—3d,) = 17264°03 with error
dy = 07.

Again starting from 8, there is a collection of meshes, chiefly of e. ‘They illustrate
the variations from normal links chiefly in link @ A noticeable peculiarity is that in
most of these meshes a line is linked by v to one corner, in all cases » being from 3 to
4 below its normal value. The regular presence of one of these links in each mesh
would seem to exclude any explanation as a chance grouping. But they further
exemplify the theory of displaced links in a, b..., for the defect from the normal
values of v is not due to themselves but to a concomitant return of a displaced a or b
