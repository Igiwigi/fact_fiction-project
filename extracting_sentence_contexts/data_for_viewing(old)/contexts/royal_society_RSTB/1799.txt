We remark here a most striking inverse movement ; if the age of the father goes
upwards, that of the mother declines. The movement is not quite equal, but the
difference of its speed is not very great; whilst the one age rises by nine years the
other falls by seven. In consequence of this fact, the total of the two ages ought to
be nearly constant, and we see really that it varies between 62 and 654 only.

Now, this inverse movement of the complementary age repeats itself at all isogens.
We remark only the modification that the sum of the ages becomes constantly
greater the higher we advance on the ladder of natality. This is but a natural
consequence of the fact that the higher ages are accompanied by a weaker pro-
creative force.

The following figures show the connexion between the degree of natality and the
change of the complementary age, as well as the average sum of the ages of both
parents taken together :—
