same independent variables as 7) equal to the function which is reciprocal to J with
regard to p, Cand H, These three vectors may be [$35] called velocities, and thus
d is in value the reciprocal of 7 with regard to all the velocities involved in the latter.
Adopting now the notation of § 33 and its assumption (end of § 33), we have

1+\= 2t= —(D,p?+ SO,Vi+SBH/47). .. . . (11)

That J, the Lagrangian function (per unit volume), and A, the free energy, should be
reciprocal functions (in value only) with regard to the velocities they contain, is
in accord with the fact (but not deducible from it) that a similar statement is true
for an ordinary dynamical system [§ 33, eq. (1) above}.

Let now A stand for the part of the free energy due to a finite portion of matter.
Required A. To find this, first obtain the rate of increase of A that would occur if
all the circumstances were such as actually occur, except that the temperature of each
element of matter is kept constant, and then add the part due to the rate of variation
of temperature. To get the first of these we have at first to find the corresponding
part of L by changing all the 8s of eq. (9) into differentiations with regard to the

time. Then we have to subtract the result from A + L, which is given by eq. (11).
Thus we get
