11 to 20, Table XIV). Moreover, changes in weight and in composition are
extremely rapid ; the flies may take more than their own weight of blood in the
course of a few minutes, and lose that, or nearly as much, in 24 hours by excretion
and evaporation. Puparia also differ greatly from one another, the coefficient of
variation of weight on the first day being over 14 in both species. As to the
limitations of the experimental method, they cannot be precisely defined, for we
cannot say that life in a cage is “ unnatural” because we are so ignorant of life
in the field. But certain facts show that conditions in the laboratory are not
unfavourable to puparia or adults. As to puparia, under favourable conditions
80%, or so hatch, which is higher than the percentage of wild puparia which hatch
in any month (Taytor, 19326, Table I). With regard to adults, at 30° C and the
most favourable humidity, half the female Glossina tachinoides lived 25 days, fig. 3 ;
the duration of life of female submorsitans was approximately the same. In the damp
cupboard life was longer, perhaps because the temperature was lower or because
the conditions fluctuated ; here half the females lived for more than two months
Table IV. We can also measure the suitability of the laboratory conditions by the
birth-rate. We believe that under favourable conditions in nature, one pregnancy
succeeds another with very short intervals. In certain months, Jounson and Ltoyp
(1923) found as many as 80%, of females pregnant ; these females had approached
man, and been captured. If we assume that they were a fair sample of all the
