prevalence of a strong easterly wind for two days, the sea falls s0 low that certain
parts of this canal are dried up. He suggested, therefore, that by measuring the depth
of water in those parts of the canal which dry up, and adding that depth to the ten
inches which I had already obtained below the mark only half an hour before, I
should ascertain the point of extreme low water as compared to that of 1770. We
accordingly found that the water in the places alluded to was fourteen inches deep ;
80 that the lowest water now is two feet below the maximum of depression sixty-four
years ago. Mr. WEsTBECK $aid that he had always heard from his father that the
mark, which was cut the year he was born, was intended to express the lowest level
of the sea during the digging of the canal in 1770.

I have already stated that there is no tide on the coast here, a circumstance which
seems very extraordinary ; but all the pilots and seamen agree in asserting the fact.
A strong wind off the shore causes the water to fall two or three feet, and to rise as
much if it he in the opposite direction. Notwithstanding these occasional oscilla-
tions, the inhabitants pretend to determine whether the sea is two or three inches
above or below its standard level. I was shown here, as at other places, rocks which
forty or fifty years ago could rarely be seen, but are now permanently above water.
I was also told of numerous rocky channels where boats could once pass, but which
had now grown too shallow, and of meadows which were yielding from time to time
a larger quantity of hay, in consequence of their increased extension on the ide
towards the sea.

I know not how much further to the sonth the same signs of a rise of the land have
been observed, but it is certain that the narrow frith in which the port of Gothenburg
