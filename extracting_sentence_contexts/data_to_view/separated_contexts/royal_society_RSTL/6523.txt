But if a notion of cracking and breaking, 80
foreign to any idea of plasticity, should be admitted, it could not be said that a glacier
moved as it is observed to move because it was plastic, but merely that it moved as if
it were plastic. The true inference from the motion would have been that glacial ice
possessed not necessarily real plasticity, a definite property of bodies, but a quasi-plasti-
city, which expresses no determinate property at all, but may consist with many different
properties. It merely expresses, in fact, the power of the component elements of the
mass of changing to a certain extent their relative positions. But this is not the pecu-
liar property of ice; it is common, indeed, to all bodies exposed to disruptive forces
which, as in the case of ice, the cohesive power is unable to withstand. The mass of
any other substance, as well as that of a glacier, will then be broken into fragments
sufficiently 8mall to allow it to follow the impulses of the external forces acting on it.
