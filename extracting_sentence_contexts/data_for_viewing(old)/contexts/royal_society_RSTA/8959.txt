there are cases where the calculated values of supposed lines of different series are the
same within observation errors.* This crowding is also increased by the existence of
the allied F series referred to above. The complete discussion of all these related
series should afford valuable material for arriving at a knowledge of displacement
laws. Here it will be sufficient to indicate the nature of the problem and to deal
with the material so far as to give confidence in the results as to the assignment of
series and especially as to accurate determinations of the oun and the various links.

As vacuum tube spectra approximate to the spark type, the difficulty of drawing
definite conclusion from the existence of a triplet separation is again enormously
increased by the presence of the link relations which these spectra show. In are
spectra the appearance of a », or », separation may always with some certainty be
ascribed to the fact that the lines in question are directly connected with series terms.

* A case in point is F; (5) and F,(17) in the series next considered ; also F's (13) and Fe (19).

Here however no such certain conclusions can be drawn. They may enter as links.
Although their true connection may ultimately be definitely settled the doubt as to
whether they give true or false scents renders the task of unravelling most
bewildering.

In about the region to be-expected we find the set
