smaller than the pure Spherechinus larve. In
all the cross-fertilisations subsequently carried out, during December and January,
the Spherechinus type of hybrid was entirely absent. We therefore observe the
striking fact that whilst in the summer months most of the hybrid larve are of the

maternal type they in most cases become modified to the paternal type in the autumn,
and in the winter the paternal type is the only one represented. As will be shown
later on, this remarkable change of type probably depends on the relative degrees of
maturity of the ova and sperm from which the hybrids are produced. With regard to the Strongylocentrotus type of hybrids as a whole, we see that they
are always considerably smaller than the pure Stronyglocentrotus larva, the difference
in size being generally about 25 per cent.
