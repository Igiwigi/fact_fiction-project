The reversal of the sequence of
1k and I, in the second sub-group can be explained as due to this greater displacement
of Ik. For it is evident that as I,k is displaced towards P,, it must gradually rise to
a higher level; and if it is displaced far enough, it will occupy a higher level than Ip,
which lies on the other side of P,, and will therefore arise after I,. This explanation is
supported by the fact that in sub-group 2, in which I,k arose at a higher level than I,,
the angular divergence of I,k from the centre of P, was less than that of I,, whereas in
sub-group 1 it was greater than that of I,, as can be seen from Table III, columns 3
and 4.

(13) The Position, Size and Form of 1,k in Sub-group 2, and Position of 1,. There can be little doubt that in all the experiments of sub-group 2, I,k was deter-
mined as a completely new leaf after the operation. For the are of its anodic stipule
was never abnormally small as in five of the six experiments of sub-group | ; indeed, it
was abnormally large for reasons which will be considered later.
