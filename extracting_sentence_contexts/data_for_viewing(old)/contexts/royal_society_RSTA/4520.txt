features in these plots are due to the width of the ribosome, which is indicated by the length of the bar above the line in the
upper plot. (Online version in colour.)

otherwise, the protein production rate is proportional to ky. For type II mRNAs, the protein
production rate varies smoothly with [aaa]. A decreased charging level again impairs translation
of species A codons which leads to an increased occupation density near the 5â€™ end of the mRNA
(figure 2d). The transition is smooth as the slow codon is at the initiation site, so there can be no
sharp onset of queuing.

In summary, for type 1 mRNAs there is a first order phase transition as [aaa] is reduced: we
move from a regime where protein production is limited by the initiation rate ky to a regime
where it is limited by the slow codon. For type II mRNAs, the protein production rate is limited
by both initiation and the slow codon; i.e. due to the fact that the first codon is slow, initiation of
new ribosomes is hindered.

(b) Amino acid starvation can lead to increased tRNA charging

Figure 2 demonstrates that amino acid starvation impairs the ribosome traffic. In this subsection,
we describe how this decreased traffic can affect the charging levels of a tRNA species delivering
an amino acid that is not subject to starvation. In figure 3a, we introduce two further idealized
mRNAs which contain three codon species and we denote these mRNA X and mRNA Y. We again
starve for amino acids of species A, but this time these tRNAs are in high abundance. Codons of
species B require a rare tRNA which carries an amino acid species that is not subject to starvation.
The third codon species makes up the rest of the mRNA and corresponds to an abundant tRNA
with constant charging level.
