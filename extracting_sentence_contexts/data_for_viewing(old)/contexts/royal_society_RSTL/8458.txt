has also been found in Kent's Cavern (sce Brit. Ass0e. Report, 1870, p. 22).


REPORT ON THE EXPLORATION OF BRIXHAM CAVE. 565

e remains of animals which may previously have frequented the cave.
Tn the instance, however, of the Brixcham Cave, although we have in evidence these
imitive works of man, they are so few and s0 scattered, and they occur also on leyels
widely different (no two, in fact, of the fifteen flint implements found there having been
met with on the same level), that it is not possible to conceive that man inhabited the
e at any time. The specimens are not numerous enough: they are found isolated
and without any corroborative adjunets.
5 Nor do we think that the flints could have been brought in by wild beasts with human
prey, fornot a fragment of a human bone was found in the cave; whereas, like with the
Snimals serving as prey, some of the remains of man in the shape of gnawed bones or
teeth must, in that case, have escaped destruction. Could the worked flints have been

Sr with the silt of the third bed? This is possible; still we are not disposed to adopt
Hat view, inasmuch as although some of the specimens show marks of wear, that wear

Hanning water; the wear is, in fact, often so slight, that in the instance of the remark-
