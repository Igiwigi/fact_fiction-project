This phenomenon has been recently noted in studies of
low-frequency dynamics in high-contrast elastic composites (e.g. [33]). We also observe that the
dispersion curves in figure 4 look similar to those for seismic metasurfaces (e.g. [34,35]). The fact that the Rayleigh wave is very pronounced in case of a high contrast, i.e. it provides a
good approximation for a broad range of frequencies, inspires approaching the original problem
in plane elasticity in §2 within the framework of the hyperbolic-elliptic model for the near-surface
wave field [29], see appendix B. However, before implementing this model, we try to reduce the
role of the coating to effective boundary conditions along the interface x2 =0 as has been done,
for example, in [3] dealing with a layered half-space subject to normal stress applied along the
surface.

4. Effective boundary conditions

Consider an inhomogeneous Dirichlet problem for an infinite thin layer (—h < x2 < 0), subject to
the boundary conditions
u; | 0 and u; | =Ui, (4.1)

xQ=—h = 9=0 =

where v;(x1, x2) are prescribed displacements.
