HumBoLpr in his narrative mentions the
determination of the extent of the diurnal oscillations, the duration of the stationary
state of the barometer at its maxima and minima, and the exact periods at which it
becomes stationary and is in action again, as desiderata. I shall take these snbjects
in order as I proceed. The extreme oscillation of the barometer in the same day never amounted to two
tenths of an inch, in fact to *1950, with a difference of the attached thermometer
during this range of +7*6, and the hygrometer 15? from the point of saturation. Wind light and variable. This took place on the 19th of April 1830.
