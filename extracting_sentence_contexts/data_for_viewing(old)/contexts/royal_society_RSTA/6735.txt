such a change will have less effect on f(y») as X)-> 1. However, the deviations from linearity
in figure 6 increase as X,—> 1, and hence it must be concluded that the new formulation of
w cannot alone account for the discrepancies when X, > 0-5.

Ficure 7, Variation of partial molar heat content of benzene with composition.

The fact that equation (10) holds with z = 2is really a consequence of the fact that empiric-

ally we find that AH, = 213X3cal./mole,
as shown in figure 7, since (10) reduces to this form when /’ = 1 and z = 2. However, equation
(10) gives AH, as the same function of X7, either for 7) = 2 and z = 2 or for r, = 1 with any

value of z. The latter would mean that the system is strictly regular, and any non-ideal
entropy of dilution could only arise as a result of the heat of mixing. However, in this case
AS, must always be negative at X,> }, but as can be seen from the experimental results, it
is everywhere positive in the present system. Moreover, it will be shown later that the magni-
tude of AS; is in fair agreement with the assumption that solvent and solute molecules occupy
one and two sites respectively. It is also clear from the difference in molar volumes of the
pure components that the solutions cannot be strictly regular.
