The values of the two middle frequencies (oF | which will be used later, are given
by
w, = (20 + 2y'/m)! |

: (3.9) Wa = (2a + 2y'/M)' |}

A very interesting fact is the asymmetry which is apparent in fig. 3c, i. The
extreme points of the middle curves are not given by (3.9) as we might have
expected, but lie on opposite sides of the (05) frequencies.
