transport fuel and waxes is possible at relatively low temperature (175°C) using catalytic cross-
alkane metathesis (CAM). This tandem reaction sequence was first discovered by Goldman,
Brookhart et al. [66] and consists of the dehydrogenation of an alkane by an iridium pincer
complex followed by cross metathesis by a Schrock-type molybdenum catalyst and finally
rehydrogenation of the formed olefin. For the CAM of PE, the polyolefin was mixed with a
light alkane (e.g. n-hexane in excess). At 175°C, a PCP-pincer iridium complex was used for
the dehydrogenation and rhenium heptoxide supported on y-AlO3 was used as the metathesis
catalyst (scheme 8). For the first optimization, the authors used n-hexane in excess, but it was
also possible to use inexpensive mixtures of alkanes such as petroleum ether. As substrates,
post-consumer PE from a plastic bottle (HDPE, My =110 kg mol“! D=6.8), food packaging
film (HDPE, My =54kg mol~!, D =17.2) and a shopping bag (LLDPE, HDPE) were used. This
reaction is an equilibrium reaction and hence would benefit from the continuous removal of the
desired alkane product fraction. However, in spite of the fact that the authors were running the
