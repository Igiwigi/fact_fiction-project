It may be obseryed, that in both cast iron and wrought iron, the calculation
from the rate of expansion to the boiling point of water gives a temperature
higher than the true; and that, in both, the calculation from the point of boil-

ing mercury affords a result lower than the true. This might afford some
grounds for conjecturing that, although the rate of expansion evidently in-
creases beyond the temperature of boiling water, it does not continue to in-
crease to the end ; but there is another inference from the fact, which I am
rather inclined to adopt. In calculating the temperature of melting cast iron, from the expansion of
the platinum bar, I applied a correction, upon the supposition that the same
rate of increase of expansion which was exhibited by platinum between the
boiling points of water and mercury continued to the higher degrees; whereas
there is great reason to suppose that the rate must be an increasing one; and,
although this-might not sensibly affect the final result of the comparatively
low temperature of melting silyer, the calculation of the temperature of melt-
ing iron, which is more than one third higher, would be sensiþly affected by
it. I think it therefore extremely probable that the true temperature of melt-
ing cast iron is below 2786?.
