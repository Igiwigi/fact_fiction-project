ACTIONS OF THE NEUROHYPOPHYSIS 409

stimulus; in the other two cases an increase of flow to 2-2 c.c./} hr. (rabbit 17), and
6-8 c.c./} hr. (rabbit 20) were seen. The significance of these two cases is rendered doubtful
by the fact that out of four control experiments in which ‘mock stimulation’ was performed,
a similar rise was observed in one case.

It is concluded that in the conscious rabbit, stimulation of the neurohypophysis does not
cause a hyperglycaemia or a diuresis, and since the electrode tip in these rabbits was
partly in the pars distalis (rabbits 17, 20, 21) and partly in the pars tuberalis (rabbit 17)
also, it seems likely that acute stimulation of these regions also fails to cause a hypergly-
caemia or diuresis. These results do not agree with those of previous observers, and it is
felt that the difference may be accounted for satisfactorily by the fact that the earlier work
was conducted on animals anaesthetized with ether (Weed et al. 1913; Keeton & Becht
1916) and pentobarbital sodium (Ingram & Barris 1935).

(4) THE NEUROHYPOPHYSIS AND UTERINE ACTIVITY

The first report on the oxytocic action of posterior lobe extracts was made by Dale
(1909), who demonstrated that these extracts cause a powerful contraction of the uterine
musculature. This work was quickly confirmed and extended, and at the present time there
is much information to hand concerning the pharmacological effects of posterior lobe
extracts on the uteri of many mammals, both in vitro and in vivo. The extent to which these
reactions occur in the normal economy of the animal is a much-debated subject, and until
a few years ago the evidence on this point was entirely presumptive. This question will be
