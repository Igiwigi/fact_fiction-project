The notch
in each exocvipital, with the adjacent dorso-lateral margin of the basioceipital, form
the anterior, superior, and inferior boundaries of a lateral orifice (at.a.), the “apertura
externa atrit” of Wessr—by which each atrium would communicate with the
exterior of the skull were it not that the aperture is completely closed by the spoon-
shaped extremity of the “stapes” of its side (fig. 9, scs., also figs. 4 and 5, at.a,),
The posterior boundary of each external atrial aperture is formed by ihe same
thick mass of fibrous tissue that forms the posterior atrial wall. The inwardly
enrved inferior extremities of the two claustra lie immediately over the external
o Atrial apertures, and may help to strengthen their dorsal lips, and possibly also
contribute to the support of the atrial roof, The two atrial cavities are in open
communication with each other and with the cavum sinus imparis anteriorly; in
fact, if it were nob for a thick yertical ridge of fibrous tissue projecting inwards
from the median line of their posterior wall (fig. 9), they might be regarded as
constituting a single transversely-disposed chamber, Essentially, the two atria may
he considered as forming a bilobed posterior prolongation of the cavum sinus tmparis
; excavated in the substance of a thick mass of fibrous tissue which forms the foor
of the neural canal over the body of the first vertebra and the contiguous dorsal
surface of the basioccipital. The fibrous tissue forming the roof and posterior wall
of the atrial cavities is continuous laterally with the fibrous walls of the neural
3 canal between the arch of the third vertebra behind, ond the exoccipitals in
front,

To his account of these structures in Amtvrus, Ramsay Warrier (43) describes an
anteriorly bilobed median excavation in the substance of the tissue overlying the
medulla oblongata which is suid ta communicate on each side with the atrial cavities,
This excavation or receptaculum dorsale is described as being “filled with the same
fluid contents as the atria and cavum.” <A precisely similir receptaculum exists
in Macrones, sud communicates with the atrial cavities by iu uperture, which, on
euch side, parforutes their fibrous roof near the superior border of the spatulate
portion of the “stapes.”
