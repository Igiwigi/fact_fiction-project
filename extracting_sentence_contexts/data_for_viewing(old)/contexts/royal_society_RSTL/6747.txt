hand, and that indicated by the above considerations as the minimum desirable in the
experiment, on the other.

A question arises as to the influence which the changes in the proportion of carbonic
acid in the air, between the assumed limits, may have upon the plant. In reference t0

this point, it may be mentioned that our own experiments upon the nature of the gas
in plants (some of the results of which will be given further on) appear to show that
the changes in the proportion of the carbonic acid in the air of the cells and intercellular
passages, and in that in the fluids of the stem, are much greater, and more rapid than
those which can take place in the atmosphere of our apparatus. In addition to this,
may be stated the fact that plants derive much of their carbonic acid from aqueous
Solution absorbed by the roots; and most probably the remainder is absorbed by the
fluids of the plant before influencing its growth. These absorptions can take place but

gowly; 50 that somewhat rapid variations in the‚Äùproportion of carbonic acid in the
atmosphere surrounding the plant, will be accompanied by much less variation in the

ion of carbonic acid within the plant. The latter will, therefore, be a lightly
varying mean between amounts corresponding to the foregoing extremes.
