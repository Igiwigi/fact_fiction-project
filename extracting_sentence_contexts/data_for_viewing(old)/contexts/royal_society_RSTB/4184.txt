is further emphasised by the*fact that not only are their synangia smaller in size
than those of W. whitbiensis, but also we only get four to six synangia in each of
our sporophylls as against, perhaps, 12 per sporophyll in NarHorst’s species.

With regard to the structure of the sporophyll, we may notice that in W. specta-
bilis, and, in fact, in all the species described by Narnorst, the middle line of the
sporophylls is somewhat thickened, and the synangia arise from this enlarged portion.
In the present genus, however, this enlargement seems to have assumed gigantic
proportions, and the sporophylls are thereby converted from tangentially flattened
almost to radially flattened structures.

The different types of synangia, as seen in cross-section, are shown in text-fig. 6,
the first four figures of which are copied from Prof. NarHorst’s papers. *

The structure of the synangia of Wiliiamsoniella seems to be identical with that in
Williamsonia, but, as regards size, the new genus again shows reduction. The
sporophylls also are free in my genus, and not united in the cup-like structure so
clearly seen in W. spectabilis and W. whitbiensis, but in both genera they seem to
