different parts of the hive does not very much affect our means of judging of the

average amount of the temperature of the hive at different periods when the thermo-
meter remains entirely undisturbed, because it is found that when the temperature
of the air is examined at about the same hour of the day, on two or more 8uecess-
ive days, and all other cireumstances being nearly the same, there will be Ã¾ut little
variation in the average amount of temperature ; 80 that we find the temperature of
the hive, at the period of swarming, amounts to about 96 Fanr., while in the month
of August it is seldom more than 80* Fann., or perhaps 86*, even in the middle of
the day, when the temperature of the atmosphere is often more than 78* Faun. The
cause of this difference between the amount of heat in the hive at this period and in
the time of swarming is readily explained by reference to the facts connected with
the production of heat. Less heat is in reality produced from the same volume of
air consumed at the high temperature of 78? Fans. than when the atmosphere is not
more than 662 Faun., as is often the case at the period of swarming, while in reality
a far less volume of air is consumed in August than in May, because the bees are not
in the same state of excitement. These facts readily account for the diminished tem-
perature of the hive in the month of August, when the temperature of the atmosphere
is in general higher than when the bees are most active.

During the period of swarming in 1836 I availed myself of the opportunity afforded
me by the annular eclipse of the sun on the afternoon of the 15th of May, of watch-
ing the effect of diminished light and atmospheric temperature on the temperature
of my hives, and the activity of their inhabitants, and found, as shown in the accom-
