“wave” in question is due. A very close accordance between the two sets of values
indicates that the phase angle is nearly constant throughout the year, with the
possible exception of months in which the “wave” in question is relatively small.
Another pretty safe inference in such a case is that the monthly values have not
suffered seriously from defects in the observational data.

With the exception of ¢, in H and I, the arithmetic mean and the yearly inequality
values for c, and ¢, in Table XIII. differ but little. There seems to be a considerable
seasonal variation in #, in H and I, but ¢, is so small in some winter months that
more than usual uncertainty attaches to the values for «, at this season. The
difference between the arithmetic mean and yearly inequality values for c; and ¢, is
more conspicuous, and probably reflects uncertainty in the monthly data rather than
true seasonal variability in the phase angles. There is, in fact, indication of but a
small seasonal variation in the values obtained for a and a, in the case of H.

The values obtained for ¢, and c, in V from the smaller number of more highly
disturbed days are much larger than those derived from all the disturbed days.
There is, however, no such enhancement in the winter value of ¢, in H, and the
results for c; and ¢, are in this respect somewhat conflicting in all the elements. The
8- and 6-hour waves may in reality be but little influenced by disturbance. Another
possible explanation, however, is that the greater irregularities existing in the data
from the smaller number of days tended to neutralise the increased amplitude of
disturbance. It is the latter explanation presumably that applies to the winter value
of ¢, in H.
