Every circumstance of the
above observation seems to me to confirm this supposition ; and
hence the observation itself, which, though single, was how-
ever a most fortunate and complete one, must appear of no
small degree of importance, since it not only confirms the
observations and inferences on the long contested lunar atmo-
sphere contained in my Selenotop. Fragm. but also furnishes
us with many more lights concerning the atmosphere of
Planets in general, than had been afforded us by all those ob-
servations collectively,


346 Mr. SCHROETER's Observations

This, and the mathematical certainty that the phznomenon
is, in fact, nothing but a real twilight in the lunar atmo-
sphere, will be farther evinced by the following theoretical
deductions, in which the same mode of computing as was used
in the observations on Venus, will be adopted, with this dif-
Å¿erence, that theangle f c g, fig. 7, Tab. VI. = AcF,is equal to
the angle Dc EF, or the geocentric elongation of the moon
from the sun.
