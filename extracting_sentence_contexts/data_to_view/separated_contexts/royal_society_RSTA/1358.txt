As shown
in [46], it is energetically favourable to keep a wetting layer of dot material between islands
since it has lower surface energy density. At lower temperature (below 725 K), the morphology of
dots remains unchanged during capping, and at a much higher temperature almost all dots are
completely eroded. The mathematical explanation and reconciliation of this phenomenon with
the fact that, by contrast, during the formation of the dots increasing the temperature enhances
their onset, remain open.

4. Selected design problems in soft matter

Soft matter encompasses a range of materials from bio and active matter to elastomers, foams,
fluids, polymers and colloids, that furthermore are subjected to and controlled by diverse material
equilibrium and dynamic mechanisms [64-73]. Here, we give only very selected examples
where material design is seen to be highly relevant, and moreover more formal, mathematical,
approaches could possibly lead to exciting progress.

(a) Self-assembly

The concept of self-assembly is today widely used to create diverse soft materials [74-76].
