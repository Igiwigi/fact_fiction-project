the position of each of the five atoms, with which these elements respectively
combine, be occupied indifferently by an electro-negative or an electro-positive
element? This question, 0 important for the advance of our knowledge of the
organic bases and their congeners, cannot now long remain unanswered.

If the views which I have just ventured to snggest should be as well borne out
by future researches as they are by the facts already known, they must, occasion a
profound change in the nomenclature of the extensive series of compounds affected
by them : I have not, however, ventured to introduce this new system of nomencla-
ture, even in the case of the new bodies described in this memoir, since hasty changes
of this kind, unless absolutely necessary, are always to be deplored. In accordance
& Vith the suggested view of the constitution of the organo-metallic compounds, the

A S following plan of nomenclature would probably be found most convenient.
