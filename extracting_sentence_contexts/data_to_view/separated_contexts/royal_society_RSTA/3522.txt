Equation (3.7) models the first Kirchhoff’s law for nodal injections and withdrawals, whereby the
sum of power inputs is equal to the sum of power outputs in a node. Power flows through a line
can be decomposed into a transfer contribution from the line itself and another from its FACTS
device (if installed) as shown in equation (3.8) (this is known as the power injection model of a
FACTS device [73]), and the total transfer is limited by the capacity of the line (see equation (3.9)). Equation (3.10) shows that FACTS devices (in this case a quad-booster phase-shifting transformer
[73]) also have limited capability to shift power. In addition, equation (3.11) represents the second
Kirchhoff’s law, where a disjunctive, big-M-based model [74] is used for new lines, ¥ being
a sufficiently large positive constant. For existing network infrastructure, we can assume that
Hin = Mery =1 in all equations.
