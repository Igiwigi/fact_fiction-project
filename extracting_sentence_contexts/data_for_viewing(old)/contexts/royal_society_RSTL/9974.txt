HALOID COMPOUNDS OF SILVER, MERCURY, LEAD, AND COPPER. 1141

Several facts require to be noted in regard to these compounds.

- (1) No. 1, containing 26 per-cent. of AgT is almost unaffected by it, and closely
resembles bromide of silver, save that a very slight contraction occurs on heating
between 125%5 and 181*5 O., and the orange coloured powder produced by pulverisa-
tion turns green on exposure to light. In No. 3, which contains a little more than
half its weight of iodide of silver, we find the greatest divergence in every respect,
from the properties of its constituents, although the influence of the Agl is very
marked both in the plasticity of the substance above 250* C., and in the considerable
contraction which takes place between 124? C. and 133* C. It possesses the lowest
AS melting point (viz. : 326* C., which is 101* C. lower than that of AgBr, which con-
5 stitutes nearly one-fourth of its weight, and 201* C. lower than that of Agl, which
S constitutes more than half its weight), and the highest specific gravity. In No. 5,
