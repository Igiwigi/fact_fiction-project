with an early head-process, was so much deformed that it cannot be used for the study
of the head-process. We quite agree with WaLpEver’s opinion (1929) that the
formation interpreted by Fanrennouz as “ Lieberkiihn’s canal” is a mere artificial
folding of the embryonal shield. On the other hand, a head-process is undoubtedly
present in this specimen.

In the Mateer-embryo (SrrEErER, 1919) the sectional plane in the region of the head-
process is so unfavourable, that the detailed study of the latter is not possible. There
is no doubt that a head-process is already developed in this specimen.

Through the kindness of Professor J. C. Brasn, we have been able to examine the
sections of the Thompson-Brash embryo. Although the preservation of this specimen
is not satisfactory, the following facts could be recognised. The head-process is in a
stage of development similar to that of the embryo Wal7 (Grosser). A median
epithelial chorda-process can be observed in the caudal region of the head-process,
accompanied by mesoderm on both sides. More cranially, the epithelial arrangement
of the cells is distinguishable only in the dorsal part of the head-process. The cells of
the most cranial part of the latter do not show any distinct epithelial arrangement.
The prochordal plate is very distinct in this specimen as a localised area of thickened
endoderm, being much more obvious than in the Dobbin embryo. It surrounds the
cranial end of the head-process as in the Manchester and Dobbin embryos, and has
not yet formed any mesoderm. In the original paper the authors express the opinion
that there is no evidence of the formation of a “‘ completion plate” in this specimen
(THomeson-Brasu, 1923, pp. 10 and 12), but there is no doubt about the existence of
a thickened endoderm area, i.e., of a prochordal plate, 11 sections (110 ») behind the
