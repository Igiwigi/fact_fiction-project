which connected the hyoid with the mandible in Heptanchus is absent in Oxyrhina,
The hyomandibula is attached to the cranium and to the first branchial arch }
the same three ligaments, as in Heptanchus; but, in addition to them, it articulates
with the cranium by a well-developed cup-and-ball joint.
Lastly, we observe that the second visceral arch, which, besides still carrying a gill
has assumed the function of suspending or carrying the first arch, is very strong and
thick ; its two principal components, the hyomandibula and the hyoid, articulate with
each other, behind by two knobs, and in front by two concave facets, between whic
is placed a round piece of fibrous cartilage, held in its place by, and partly imbedded
in, connective tissue (fig. 3 c.). The suspensorium in Oxyrhina is consequently
formed chiefly by the hyoid. b
Sphyrna zygena (fig. 4).â€”The first visceral arch is comparatively weak ; the palate
quadrate bar is, in fact, several times thinner than it is in Oxyrhina, and still weaker
than in Heptanchus. The second arch is very strong. The thick and long hyoman-
dibula articulates with the skull, and has the same ligaments (cranial and branchial)
as have the two previous types. The long ligament from the under surface of the
cranium, connecting the latter in Oxyrhina with the hyoid and mandible, after having
received a band from the hyomandibular, is likewise present in Sphyrna, but, as the
drawing shows, the direction of the angles formed by these ligaments with the parts
to which they are attached is reversed.
The lig. mandib. hyoid. internum, absent in Oxyrhina, is present in Sphyrna, as in
Heptanchus.
The inner big knob of the mandible, near the inner or median quadrato-mandibula
articulation, articulates with its slightly rounded anterior surface against a distinet
concavity of the posterior surface of the proximal end of the hyoid. The lig.
