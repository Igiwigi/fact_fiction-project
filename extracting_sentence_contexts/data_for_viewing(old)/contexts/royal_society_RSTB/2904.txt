THE ACTION OF INDIAN COBRA VENOM. 401

nerve-ends remain quite unaffected, or at least non-paralysed (a) in animals which
have been poisoned by large intravenous doses of venom, and (b) in those which have
received doses of venom subcutaneously not greatly above the lethal, and which have
taken 4 or 5 hrs. to die; (3) that the phrenic nerve-ends can be paralysed by the
administration of large lethal doses of venom, provided that the animal be kept alive
long enough by artificial respiration.

Ragorzr observed that the diaphragm contracted more feebly as death approached,
and argued from this that the phrenic nerve-ends were paralysed. But a central
paralysis might equally explain this phenomenon if it be a fact. Then again, could
Racorat really cut off the blood supply of the snout for a long period (such as is
demanded to produce nerve-end paresis, according to his own admission) without at
the same time damaging the nutrition of the nerves and muscles he was studying ?
He used an iron ring for the compression of the parts. In proportion as his com-
pression was efficient, so must his interference with the healthy action of the parts
have increased ; if his constriction was only partial the envenomated blood was still
circulating, and was obviously acting at an advantage on tissues damaged by deficient
nutrition. If the constriction was complete, or if on the other hand it was very
incomplete, our conclusions are still more obvious.

I believe that the true interpretation of Racorziâ€™s experiment is the one I have
already given, namely, that by artificial respiration the partially paralysed respiratory
