The growth of an XÂ°-infected tobacco plant is much hampered, compared with one
infected with the ZL, and still more with one infected with the G strain. The leaf area
during the first 2 months is probably less than one-quarter of the latter and about
one-third that of one infected with the L strain. It is an interesting fact that old tobacco plants infected with the L strain frequently
display a more chlorotic mottle than do those which harbour the more virulent S
strain. In fact the character of the strain cannot be gauged by the clinical appearance
of the plants which harbour it after a stay of 2-3 months in the glasshouse. On Datura.
