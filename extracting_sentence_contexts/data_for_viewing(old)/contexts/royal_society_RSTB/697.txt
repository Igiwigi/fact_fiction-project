observation that its radially arranged cells (Plate 51, fig. 2 ) were generated at an
undulating circular line which constituted the external border of the zone, the whole
being primarily derived from a thin cellular layer of the cortex interposed between
the leaf-cushions and the prosenchymatous zone. But my most complete notice of
what appears to me to be the true history of the development of this tissue was only
announced in 1887 in my Memoir on Stigmaria ficoides, published by the Palzonto-
graphical Society (pp. 18-22, figs. 22, 23, 24, and 24a). In this publication I
demonstrated the existence of what I ventured to call a bark-cambiwm between
the outermost cortex and its prosenchymatous zone, and through the meristemic
actions of which additions were constantly made to the exterior of that zone, through-
out the greater portion of the life of the plant; it being further evident that such
copious thickenings of the cortex equally affected the aerial stems, the branches, and
the Stigmarian roots. One fact more connected with this prosenchymatous zone is
seen in the specimen represented by fig. 1. Its first development in young twigs
does not advance simultaneously throughout the entire circle of the cortex. In the

example fig. lf there is an are, the chord of which is about °5 of an inch in length, in
which the zone has not yet made its appearance, whilst on the opposite side of the
circle each radial line of the prosenchymatous cells coutains fully a dozen of them,
Outside this zone we have the outermost cortical zone, which we shall understand best
by referring to my enlarged figures of some of these structures as seen in longitudinal
sections.
