in fact, no disturbance of one or more diagonals of N can produce N' a repetition of N. Tf the limiting axes were alike, it might possibly occur that N' should be a reflexion of
N, the configuration of one read from right to left in the interval being that of the other
read from left to right. It is to be observed here, and in all products that we may handle of the form of
