and Pz 7 in equation (2.2), and in this form, the equation is the transverse momentum-dependent
(TMD) version of the factorization theorem.

Now each of the P4/g,r vectors has an azimuthal angle ¢4/g that determines its orientation
around the central axis. In each of the hadronization clouds, there is nothing to pick out a
particular azimuthal angle, the partons and hadrons are all unpolarized, and the clouds in figure 4
have a large spacelike separation. So, in a purely classical picture, we would not expect any
azimuthal dependence in the cross section.


Figure 4. A schematic of the products of an e* e~ collision showing the virtual photon in the centre. A quark (red) and anti-
quark (faded red) move apart from each other in a back-to-back configuration. The cloud puffs represent the hadronization
process. Hadrons other than fy and hg are also produced but are not shown in the figure. The fact that the pair's spins can
remain entangled is represented by the vertical arrows. (Online version in colour.)

However, the quark and anti-quark, despite being unpolarized, nevertheless have entangled

spins, and this results in a measurable azimuthal dependence. The situation is very reminiscent of : =
the Einstein—Podolsky—Rosen scenario [4], but with the process of hadronization taking the place : =
of separate, distant measurements. The entangled spins are allowed in the TMD factorization 1B
theorem for this process, with fragmentation functions each carrying transverse spin indices. The : =
resulting azimuthal dependence is called the Collins effect [5]. 28

This example illustrates how factorization theorems lose some of their naively classical features [3
as one examines the finer details involved in a process, such as small kicks of transverse :s
