A leaf of gold and a very fine non-conducting
stratum of mica or of glazed paper being interposed prevented the phenomenon, that
is to 8ay, the induced contractions in the galvanoscopic frog failed to appear, whilst
a stratum of fine paper soaked in water did not interrupt the induced contraction. From the whole of these facts I was led to conclude, â€”I1st, that the contraction in-
duced in the galvanoscopic frog could not be attributed to the effect of derived cur-
rents; 2nd, that it should rather be considered the effect of an electric discharge
taking place during the contraction of a muscle. For the sake of supporting this
explanation of the induced contractions by facts, I instituted a great number of ex-
periments which are described in the tenth chapter above referred to. With this
view I compoxsed a pile of entire frogs, and closed the circuit with the two extremities
of the galvanometer. Allowing the needle to become stationary, I touched specially
the nerves of the frogs composing the pile with a solution of potassa, by which means
