several directions successively into the line of the magnetic force. Porss0Nn would
have called such a direction through the mass a principal axis of magnetic induction,
and I have elsewhere called it a line of elective polarity. When a spbere or cube of
bismuth is freely suspended in the magnetic field, with the direction referred to hori-
zontal, in all positions except two the forces acting on the mass tend to turn it ; those
positions are, when the line of maximum magnetization is axial and when it is equa-
torial, the former being a position of unstable, and the latter a position of stable
equilibrium. When the above line is oblique to the direction magnetization, the
sphere or cube will turn round its axis of suspension until the direction referred to
has set itself at right angles to the line joining the poles. Now if the direction of
maximum magnetization be transyerse to an elongated mass of bismuth, such a mass
must, when the said direction recedes to the equator, set its length from pole to pole.
The facts observed by M. MaTTEvcer seem to me to be a simple corroboration of this
deduction ®*,

The third objection is directed against an imaginary case, © si Von considere les
plans de clivage et la ligne de compression comme jouissant les meme proprict6s.”
It must be evident that a erystal like bismuth, possessing a number of cleavages of
unequal values, cannot be compared in all respects with a body which has suffered
pressure in one direction only. I have no doubt whatever that by a proper applica-
tion of force, in different directions, a compressed mass might be caused to imitate to
perfection every one of the actions exhibited by crystallized bismuth. Indeed I would
go farther, and say, that I shall be happy to undertake to reproduce, with bisxmuth
powder, the deportment of any diamagnetic crystal whatever that M. MaTTEUCc!
may think proper to name.
