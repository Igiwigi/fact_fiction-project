A possible implication of these findings that are suggested to correspond to evidence integration pro-
could be that posterior brain regions such as LIP are respon- cesses in both perceptual and value-based decision-making
sible for the formation of the initial decision, before this [6,27â€”29]. It is also striking that the timing of emergence of

action selection. However, the fact that the chosen-value with the timing of the emergence of chosen value signals in

actions between anterior and posterior regions.
