stringent, being applied only to one generation, and consisting in our taking marriages
entered into at any time of life for either husband or wife, and lasting till the death
of one member or for at least fifteen years. Even in this case the pedigree of the
wife had to be sought for from one record to another and often in vain. It is the
male pedigree with which the recorder in nearly all cases occupies himself.

Only those who have attempted the labour of extracting, as has been done in this
ease, some 16,000 separate returns, will fully grasp the difficulty of making the
limitations of selection more and more complex ; the quantity to be obtained becomes
dangerously small and the labour immensely increases. Even could with time and
patience a sufficient selection of ideal cases have been made, it does not follow that
the result would be satisfactory ; for, we should have made a narrow selection, and
this very fact might indicate that possibly we have been selecting one grade or class
of fertility. It is possible that the less fertile are the weaker, and so more liable
to die early ; or again it may be the more fertile women who are subjected to the
more frequent risk of childbed, and thus are less likely to appear in the selection of
long marriages. Even greater or less risk at birth may be an inherited character
in women, and may not unfairly be looked upon in itself as a factor limiting fertility
naturally.

Taking these points into consideration, it seemed that if we were to have enough
material to draw conclusions from we must entirely drop all attempt to classify by
age of parents at marriage. We might make some limitations but they must not be
very stringent; they must leave room for an increase of stringency in different
directions, so that we could roughly appreciate the influence of the screening factors.
