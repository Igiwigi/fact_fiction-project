inverse proportion to the thickness of the top layer and to the density difference between
top and middle layer. In view of the doubt which still attaches to estimates of the relation
between drag and wind speed, (7) should only be regarded as an approximate guide.
In passing it may be pointed out that the thermocline slopes observed in figures 5, 7
and 8 are all, with the possible exception of figure 7, considerably less than those estimated
from (7). This does not necessarily point to inadequacies in the theory, but may be due to

a variety of causes: over-estimation of mean wind velocity, the fact that the fetch was not
long enough to allow the full drag to develop, or that the time of blow was not long enough
to build up the maximum slope. It is clear that time relations are important here, and it is
hoped that more detailed observations with adequate wind data will be made in future.
In this connexion, the results of a theoretical investigation by Proudman & Doodson (1924)
of the time relations of meteorological effects on the sea surface may be applied. They
showed that under certain conditions the surface slope set up by wind stress may first
oscillate about its final steady-state value.

There is an obvious limit to the magnitude of s,, or its equivalent in lakes, and
Hellstrém’s investigations do not cover what happens when this limit is exceeded. But it
may be assumed that the steady states illustrated in figures 13a and 14a and 6 will only
persist as long as the slope of the upper interface does not become so steep that either it
