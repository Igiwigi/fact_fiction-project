in which (i) all the symbols 2, j, ... in the upper row are distinct and (ii) all the symbols in
the lower row are distinct. Further, since a form containing a factor a, is reducible, no pair
of consecutive symbols, one from the upper row and one from the lower row, can refer to
the same quadratic. If we call the grade of such a product the number of symbols 2, f, ...
involved, then only forms of grade less than eleven need be considered, since otherwise, as
only five quadratics are under consideration, a symbol would be repeated in either the upper
or lower row. In fact, as we shall see, the maximum grade of an irreducible product is
considerably lower. We observe that the same product can in certain cases be written in
several ways, thus

If a symbolic product contains bracket factors, it may be expressed in the form PQ,
where P is the product of the bracket factors and Q the product of factors a4, uz, a,. We have
seen that it is only necessary to consider the cases in which all the factors of P are either of
type (abc), (abu) or of type (ay), (afx). The two sets of forms which arise in this way are
evidently dual to each other, and since in the process of discussing these products we shall
deal simultaneously with a pair of dual forms, we may consider, as typical, the case in which
P is composed entirely of factors (abc), (abu). Since P does not involve any symbol a, any
such symbol occurring in Q must occur twice. Hence Q can be expressed as the product of
