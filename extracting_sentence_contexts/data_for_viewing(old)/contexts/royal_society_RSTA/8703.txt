provided that P is inside the surface S.
Equations of similar forms apply when tlie space considered is outside the surface
8; but then the sign of the last equation (7°11) is reversed, giving

(7°12) f(uS—o oH) dS = + detip

it is then necessary to assume also that at infinity, u, v both correspond to
divergent waves (unless it is known that wu tends to zero more rapidly than 1/r).

* Compare MACDONALD, loc. cit., pp. 120-122. The cause of the difficulty is to be found in the fact
that now the stationary value may be expected to arise from values of n for which « is small. Then n is
nearly equal to z, and in all such cases more complicated analysis is inevitable. In fact the approximations
to S, (2) and E, (2) require to be modified by different formule corresponding to the cases n > 2, <2
and to the cases in which |n —2| is of order 2/s or of lower order.


SCATTERING OF PLANE ELECTRIC WAVES BY SPHERES. 199

Let us now consider the problem of waves incident from some source (or sources)
and reflected from the surface 8. Let « denote any Cartesian component of force in
the incident wave, and let the point P be outside 8S, Then (7°1) applies, and so

because u has no singularity inside 8,
If u’ denotes the corresponding component of force in the reflected wave, we have
