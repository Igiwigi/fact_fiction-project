The results do
not supporb MAXWELL's extension of WEBER's theory, for they show that all changes
of magnetism caused by changes of magnetising force exhibit that lagging action
which I have called hysteresis. The word © retentiveness,” commonly restricted to
name that property in virtue of which the magnetic metals retain a portion of their
magnetism when the magnetising force is removed, might with propriety be extended
s0 as to designate the resistance to any change of magnetic state (whether increase or
decrease) which they exhibit whenever the magnetic field in which they are placed
suffers any change. The existence of residual magnetism when the field is reduced
to zero is, in fact, only one case of an action which occurs whenever the field is varied
in any way, namely, a tendency to persistence of previous magnetic state. And my
experiments show that when the magnetisxm of iron is altered by varying, not the
field, but the state of stress of the metal, the same tendency again manifests itself. The word retentiveness might be extended 80 far as to cover this case of lagging als;
and if hysteresis were found only in these and similar magnetic phenomena, there
would be no need to invent a name for it.
