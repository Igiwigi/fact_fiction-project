the outer zone of that nucleus (see fig. 1).

The remnant of the anterior limb above described is bounded on its inner aspect,

i.e., along the middle line of the cerebrum by a narrow (1-2 mm. wide) strip of
inexcitable tissue. (? Septum lucidum and anterior perforated spot, grey matter.)

Summary and Application of the Anatomical Facts.

It remains to connect these anatomical data with the facts observed upon
excitation.

In the first place discrimination must be made betw√©en the effects of exciting
fibres in their continuity and on their transverse section respectively, since it is
plain that the identity of result might otherwise lead to an undesirably extended
view of the limits of the efferent tract.

Reference to fig. 1 and to Table I. shows that some of the efferent excitable fibres
which partly compose the anterior limb in Group I. are rapidly concentrated in the
posterior limb as we descend to Group III. These fibres are those for the move-
ments of opening the mouth and protrusion of the tongue, as is shown by a glance
at fig. 1, C and F.
