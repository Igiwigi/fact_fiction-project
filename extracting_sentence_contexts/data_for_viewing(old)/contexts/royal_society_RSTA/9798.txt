The only case of “failure” is the first difference for Sr in which the estimated
possible error is extremely small. If the possible error be the sum of those of each
line, the value is 15 in place of 7, and if d, be calculated from the most probable
value of the oun it should be about 5} greater, 7.e., 52d, = 3600. It will be noted
that where triplets enter, the-two satellite differences, and consequently the two
satellite separations, are extremely close to the ratio 5:3. This ratio seems to
persist also in Hg where the separations are in reverse order, and we find a ratio of
3:5 in place of 5:3. The law for this ratio is in fact much more closely obeyed
than the corresponding one for the ratio 2:1 for the triplet separations. It is
therefore of great assistance in searching for the lines of F series whose limits are
VD (2), and which consequently possess constant triplet separations in this ratio. Its
explanation should be expected to throw some valuable light on the constitution of
the atom. The general dependence of the differences on the small “oun” 3, should
also be noted.

Passing now to the consideration of the satellite differences for orders beyond the
first (m>2), it is seen that they still depend on multiples of the oun, but different
from those of the first order. In a large number of cases the multiples are the same
