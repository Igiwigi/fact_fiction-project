This phenomenon cannot be attributed to common electri-
cal repulsion ; for in the electro-magnetic circuit, similar
electrified conductors do not repel, but attract each other ;
and it is in the case in which conductors in opposite states are


new phenomenon of electro-magnetism. 157

brought near each other on surfaces of mercury, that repul-
5ion takes place. Nor can the effect be referred to that kind of action which
occurs when electricity passes from good into bad conduc-
tors, as in the phenomena of points electrified in air, as the
following facts seem to prove. Steel wires were substituted
for copper wires, and the appearances were the same in
kind, and only less in degree ; without doubt, in consequence
of a smaller quantity of electricity passing through the steel
wires: and by comparing the conducting powers of equal
cylinders of mercury and steel in glass tubes, by ascertaining
the quantity of iron filings they attracted, it was found that
the conducting powers of mercury were higher than those of
steel ; the first metal taking up fifty-eight grains of iron
filings, and the second only thirty-seven. Again ; fused tin was substituted for mercury in a porcelain
vessel into which wires of copper and steel were alternately
ground and fixed : the elevations were produced as in the
mercury, and the phenomena of rotation by the magnet ; and
it was found by direct experiment, that the conducting powers
of the tin, at and just before its point of fusion, did not percep-
tibly differ, and that they were much higher than those of mer-
cury.
