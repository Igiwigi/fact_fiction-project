The history of the crops clearly indicates that, of the total phosphates
present in the soils of these plots, only a small proportion are in a form in which they

can be utilised. Even in ordinary farming it is a familiar fact that, on soils con-
taining a good deal more phosphoric acid than this, a few ewts. of superphosphate
per acre will often make the difference between a full crop of roots and one that is all
but a failure. This being so it is evident that such ratios as those just given for
total phosphoric acid would have little significance if we wished to compare soils from
different fields, or to judge of their relative mineral fertility, or to forecast the probable
advantage of applying phosphatic manure or the economy of withholding it.
